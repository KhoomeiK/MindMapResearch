Blackops4,esd4b5r,t1_esd411z,1561846743.0,Welp it will eventually with the rise in quality. And it wouldnt just be CoD it will be every game
Blackops4,esd2xur,t1_esc9t6d,1561845668.0,"Yeah its going to suck whenever 8k or 16k which ever is next, the price of game will probably raise from 60 to like 80"
Blackops4,esbxdx4,t1_esbu4hg,1561814771.0,"Because the old days games were a lot cheaper to make, now with the 4k res and high quality in general they are taking more money to make."
Blackops4,esb5dh3,t1_esb51a8,1561778686.0,Says a part of this braindead sub. You people dont understand business at all
Blackops4,esb4nnc,t1_esb4dp2,1561778035.0,Are you stupid? THERE IS A RE-ROLL SYSTEM YEAH ITS NOT GREAT BUT ITS BETTER THAN NOTHING. You people need to stop bitching and moaning when you dont even realize THEY ARENT GOING TO CHANGE IT. This sub isnt even 5% of the community they dont fucking care. Its called fucking grinding if you dont like it STOP PLAYING. You people are so annoying get over the fucking system ITS NOT CHANGING. Goodbye smart ass
Blackops4,esb423c,t1_esb3dgb,1561777491.0,You just dont understand it. They want you to spend money on the game for one. For two they dont do community challenges because Activision i bet doesnt just let Treyach. Why they cant be a 1% chance because THEY WANT MONEY. And if you truly want them you are going to have to grind for them. Why it was so easy on WW2 was due to the fact Sledgehammer had to make up for AW and Activision knew that. Let alone Treyach makes Activision the most money and dont try telling me they dont because I just checked.
Blackops4,esb2z9b,t1_esb2b13,1561776528.0,"Thats the point of the system though, they are supposed to be p2w because Activision wants you to buy more and more reserves so they can continue to make more and more money. But I can say you are entitled because you pretty much want DLC weapons fed to you. Be happy they made the Grav a community challenge and didnt put it in the reserves."
Blackops4,esb1rrz,t1_esb1na4,1561775467.0,"I could care less im happy with my Daemon, Rampage and Grav. This whole sub is so entitled they cant even understand a business"
Blackops4,esas47r,t3_c6ps7p,1561767220.0,Or you could realize that this sub doesnt even stand for 5% of the community and stop being entitled shits just a thought ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Blackops4,esarodq,t1_esar6nq,1561766853.0,Another one of you dumbasses that dont understand that Activision is a business and have to make money to produce all these games somehow. You entitled shits just need to get that or leave
Blackops4,esaq2zr,t1_esapfbe,1561765620.0,"True lol, probably sucks at the game and that why"
Blackops4,esantpt,t1_esan1lx,1561764038.0,"You are gonna have to, they wont stop for a small portion of the community"
Blackops4,esamt2n,t1_esam30r,1561763333.0,"Yeah but for real these posts are getting really old, Im tired of this entitled community from bitching about DLC weapons to the black ops pass owners should get a free DLC weapon. You need to grow up and realize that they are a business and have to make money too."
Blackops4,esammpu,t1_esalvki,1561763207.0,You are literally retarded. The higher health system was so the game would be more about comp than casual play. The system was geared for the more non-casual players. You literally don't have a fucking clue what you are talking about.
Blackops4,esam6o9,t1_esajttu,1561762896.0,"For real, they bitch and moan like this sub is the whole damn community. Activision has to make some money off the game somehow and DLC/MK2 weapons is the way to go. I dont mind the system it works just fine."
Blackops4,esalzi8,t1_esaj3ag,1561762755.0,"Well by now you should know Activision is going to put supply drops in the game, they have done it since AW. You can literally play and get reserves, or you can pay money to get them like Activision wants. All of you people bitching and moaning about them don't even realize they could just make it to so you have to pay for reserves if you would like that better. If you don't like that gtfo no one asked you to continue playing"
Blackops4,esahyiu,t3_c6ol8j,1561760048.0,"I hate seeing post complaining about DLC weapons, if you don't like the system don't play the game simple. Its a business strat because Activision knows people will buy the reserves and they aren't gonna stop due to a small portion of the community complaining"

AskReddit,es6vzbo,t1_es6ef1h,1561658503.0,"Not from there but Im from IN. At my school some girl got upset after finding out her nudes were being sent around and she had her bf try to find out who it was. All the commotion it was causing it ended up getting to the principles. They ended up calling in the police and having half the school come to the office. We ended up losing like half our football team to suspensions. A few of my friends were called down too, 1 of my friends got caught and now has a child pornagraphy charge to his name. I feel bad for him but there is nothing I can do. A few other guys got caught and have charges too. I dont have any idea what happen to the girls but they probably only got lessons knowing how my principle is a pedo."
AskReddit,es6dmoc,t1_es63p0p,1561646869.0,why does this sound like my school?

AskReddit,es0rmwg,t3_c59kyp,1561481684.0,"Honestly once I played bloody knuckles with 2 of my friends and when we started, I hit almost as hard as I could and they said. ""Damn Dom you can hit harder than I thought."" That made me feel really good about myself and boosted my confidence by quite a lot since Im all skin and bones. Plus everyone generally thinks im weak as can be. Dont recommend it but I mean it helped."

Blackops4,es07rjz,t3_c56153,1561468283.0,"Treyarch isn't the main problem it Activision and there greedy pockets, they literally forced to come out before it was ready and the only reason we probably have supply drops and OP weapons in them."
