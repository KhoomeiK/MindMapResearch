You’d be surprised how many people devoloped schizophrenia after consuming marijuana. Professionals say that you’d have to be predisposed to getting schizophrenia in order to get it from weed. So judging by your family history I think it’s best to stay away from it."
schizophrenia,fny9t1p,t3_g4k87i,1587357017.0,"I get it. I look back at my delusions and feel as if I didn’t even believe of them at the time, but the reality is that I did. I think that’s the fucked up part about this illness is that you feel as if you’re normal especially when you’re well medicated, but once you stop or have another episode then you get the reality check that it’s real. You’re not faking it. You’re just well medicated. I think. I don’t know I’m not a doctor but I hope this helped"

Then later, when I changed my psychiatrist because my insurance doesn’t cover the hospital he works at, my new psychiatrist diagnosed me with bipolar disorder. I told him that I had already been diagnosed with schizoaffective he said that it’ll take time for the final diagnosis but for now I’m diagnosed with bipolar and that my medications won’t change that much since both rely on antipsychotics as treatment."
