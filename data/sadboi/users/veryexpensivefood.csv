kardashians,fql28z6,t3_gjbzql,1589443744.0,I always thought Kourtney had the best taste in that family. She knows how to use designer without it being flashy or too tacky. She's also naturally the prettiest IMO. Id probably buy stuff from her if she did a home decor line.
AnimalCrossing,fqipo0d,t3_giwjz7,1589399190.0,So bold.
thesopranos,fqh170b,t1_fqgz298,1589364279.0,I agree that there's a lot of clever moments and characters like Silvio and Paulie are wildly entertaining but it's not the kind of show that I'm laughing out loud watching. It's a more subtle humor.
thesopranos,fqh0izf,t3_gipu9b,1589363618.0,"AJ is a child who grew up being told he's not cut out for Tony's ""lifestyle"" but Tony also is dissapointed when AJ is not cut out for his ""lifestyle"". He's an outsider in his father's world and he knows it and feels it. He also has mental health issues that his father also has but discussion surrounding this issue is stigmatized by both Tony and Carmella. Everything they own is stollen off the back of a truck but Carmella is going on and on about church. I feel for AJ. I grew up with kids in similar situations. It's very accurately New Jersey."

thesopranos,fqgy3z1,t3_gio4pd,1589361185.0,I don't think I've actually laughed once watching this show. There are absolutely no good jokes in this show but it's still an excellent show. Maybe Tony and his undying love for the ducks was funny at first.

Maybe start by figuring out a couple things that are really important to you and go from there. Do you like animals? Do you like art? What music do you identify with? You're very young and you have time to really figure it out.
