Eat, drink, pee and poop normally/by itself. If they fail to do one of those things they're not gonna have any quality of life. 

Furthermore, your cat is 15 years old. Did you know, on average, cats get to be 14-15 years old? The 18-20 year old cats are exceptions. Vets cannot make the decision for you, nor can anyone else. I just hope I've given you enough information to make the decision. This definitely helped me a lot and my cat was only 2,5 years old..
