Was taking the public transit bus home from classes when a woman started having a seizure. Couldn’t do anything for her until the seizure stopped but in the meantime I yelled for the bus driver to stop the bus and call 911. After her seizure stopped I wanted to get her into the recovery position but needed help. Everyone else on the bus was just staring so I pointed to a man and said “you, grab her legs and help me lower her to the ground.” Nothing. He didn’t even move. So I, way more forcefully, said it again. It’s like he snapped out if whatever daze he was in and helped. She started coming around by the time the paramedics arrived, though very dazed. 

The main thing I just couldn’t wrap my head around was how everyone was just sitting there when her seizure started and then standing there staring. Not even asking if there was anything they could do."

My GSD has severe allergies, of which he’s gone through a lot of testing and a plethora of treatments before we found what he’s specifically allergic to and what works for him, and I work w/a GSD rescue so am giving observations based on my experiences.

My response was, “so if it was a ‘real’ wedding you’d want to celebrate with us but because we signed the papers before hand, you don’t.” We’ve been married 6 yrs, the celebration was 4-1/2 yrs ago, and everyone that had issues at the time has gotten over it. They see we’re happy and that’s what matters. 

I’m not sure I have specific advice and again, I’m sorry your fiancee’s mom is putting her wants over your guy’s. Thought maybe sharing my own experience, and how it played out after a few years, could give you a small glimmer of light down the road."
dogs,f0xolf3,t1_f0xo3ex,1569039901.0,"I cannot give you a work guarantee that he will move the actual branch you need when you need it moved. But he will be moving branches. Probably won’t get those straight mow lines working with him. He will chase the bee, though, so it might distract him from his wood-moving duties."
dogs,f0xnqti,t1_f0xn1sc,1569038976.0,"Problem is, he puts it where he wants. Not where it belongs. We had a pile of boards to use if one of the fence boards needed replacing. Not anymore. It’s now part of Ajax’s pile of lumber. We used to move back to the back of the yard. He’d just drag it all back to the middle of the yard, which is no small feat. He’d drag a 6’ plank from behind an outdoor shed, between the shed and the fence with an about 8’ clearence, and then about 30’ to the middle of the yard. Did this 3x. We stopped buying the planks unless we need them. Then he’d move onto the firewood. Now we just push it all off to the side. Less work for all of us. And now the firewood is closer to the firepit so he was onto something."
dogs,f0xmmuz,t1_f0xlyci,1569037804.0,"LOL. That’s hilarious! So while Elwood’s hunting trying to kill everything, Ajax (the GSD) is trying to find something to do. So like I said someone was trying to dump him in a shelter. It was actually a friend of a friend that bought him from a breeder that didn’t want to take the time for him. He’s a purebred from a working line and needs a job. So when I’m not constantly throwing the Kong for him he will go and drag every piece of wood he can find and amass a pile. And if he can’t get his pile exactly how he wants he’ll start barking at it and moving the pieces around. All the while running back and forth to me to get me to help him. My place is a mad house. And I mentioned I foster dogs, too, right. 😂"
dogs,f0xj7c1,t1_f0xgeg7,1569034414.0,"Take your hound’s personality towards small animals, put it in a 45-lb “I’ll-kill-anything-with-4-legs-and-fur-no-matter-the-size” package, and you have Elwood. We don’t have a rat problem, raccoon problem, opossum, squirrel or any other kind of outdoor rodent issue people sometimes talk about. He has brought at least one of each of those to me."
dogs,f0xfyan,t1_f0xeb50,1569031419.0,"I know they’re used as a hunting breed. I rescued him from a shelter not having a clue what he was, nor knowing he was insane. Lol. Didn’t find out he was crazy until I moved in with my husband and he started attacking the Weimy. Thought it was adjustment so we took in the GSD someone was going to dump at the shelter. Turns out he’s actually dog-aggressive. Took years of training to work with him on that. He can only live with the Weimy and GSD. We don’t introduce him to the fosters and he’s always muzzled when we go out. Anyway, we were out and someone saw him and mentioned he looked like a Mountain Cur. Looked it up. Sure enough, that’s what he looks like, albeit a mix. Personality and all. Including, you guessed it...dog-aggression. They’re recommended to be in single dog households."
dogs,f0xe1wh,t1_f0xc25k,1569029738.0,"Like I said, my GSD is EXTREMELY neurotic. He’s got a schedule and I better nor mess with it. On the other hand he’s the best, and most easily trained dog, I’ve ever had. Again, because he has to have his schedule. The Mountain Cur...is just fucking crazy. If I’m around he behaves. If I’m not all hell breaks loose. Hence, the crate. The Weimy is “technically” my husband’s dog b/c he got him long before we started dating but I’m the food lady so he likes me better now. 😊"
dogs,f0xboou,t1_f0xazea,1569027692.0,"He’s actually the only one who gets to sleep in the bed. Our GSD is extremely neurotic and won’t sleep unless he’s in his crate with the door shut and locked. Our Mountain Cur is a crazy SOB that if he hears anything outside and can’t attack it, he’ll attack one of the other dogs so he gets a crate. And then we foster for a rescue and they all get crates as well. So we kind of had to develop a system, too."
dogs,f0wukmj,t1_f0wpwms,1569014340.0,"Mine’s leggy too but he lays with his back up against me so when I move he just kind of burrows further against me so he’s still touching me. 

It’s my husband that has the problem of moving and our Weimy getting mad. But that only happens when it’s just the two of them. If I’m there, my husband could jump on the bed and he wouldn’t care. 😂"

I’m also an engineer and when I graduated I made the mistake of telling my parents how much my salary was. Whatever you do, don’t tell your mom what you make. She’ll just keep piling on the guilt and try to find a way to get more money out of you."
dogs,f0vhgct,t3_d6sntc,1568981793.0,"I’m so sorry for what happened to your dog. And I know it was traumatic to you, too. I’m in the US so can’t help with the laws where you’re at. Just want to say I work with GSD rescue here and yes, they are a breed that needs to be worked with. Thank you for looking out for the dog and understanding it’s not the dog’s fault and it’s the owner failing the dog."
dogs,f0vg0zc,t3_d6rj2g,1568980357.0,"Everytime I adjust in bed, my 80-lb Weimy adjusts too to make sure he’s laying against me. By morning, every morning, I’m halfway off the bed. He’s 11-yrs-old and in his retirement years, so we let him get away with pretty much everything. 🙂"
reactivedogs,f0v9by3,t1_f0v2gr4,1568971285.0,"I understand what you’re saying and that’s why I do muzzle him. It’s for his, and the other dog’s protection b/c not the other dog’s fault they have an idiot owner."
AskVet,f0rkk6s,t3_d6b4sm,1568886035.0,"If your puppy hasn’t eaten in 3 days and his stool isn’t normal a visit is recommended. I am not a vet so can’t tell you if it’s an emergency or not, but maybe call the emergency vet and they can tell you if you need to bring him in. Some emergency vets will do this, some won’t but it’s worth a phone call."
BipolarReddit,f0quyu0,t3_d64zck,1568867065.0,"My low appetite stems from a couple things. I don’t eat when I’m stressed, I have chronic migraines so am nauseous a lot and my migraine meds knock me for almost a full day. I’m also on Trokendi, which has made me drop weight. 

It’s the same for me as others have said, I don’t get hungry and forget to eat. (Which drives my husband crazy b/c he can’t understand how someone forgets to eat.) The other issue I have is low blood pressure so forgetting to eat can really mess with that sometimes. 

When I remember I need to eat, it’s usually fruit, snacks, crackers, 1/2 sandwiches. Something easy to grab. Thankfully my husband cooks so I do have at least one meal/day."
AskVet,f0qr221,t3_d65k20,1568864704.0,I second the internal medicine specialist and while you’re there ask about Canine Megaesophagus.  Regurgitation is one of the symptoms.

reactivedogs,f0oxaw0,t1_f0ou30s,1568822360.0,Huh. I don’t know if they can do that but I’m going to ask. I’ll be up there today.
reactivedogs,f0owyts,t1_f0otqp7,1568822145.0,"Working with a rescue, the people I work with understand. We do temperament testing and have seen all types of aggression. They also know I know how to handle my dog and situations we may come across. I was actually attacked by a dog we took into the rescue. There’s a story to it and if you’d like to hear it, I’ll tell it, but having the experience with my dog and the rescue saved me from serious injury. 

Other people that don’t have a reactive dog, however, think we’re overreacting or suggest things when they have no clue what they’re talking about. Someone made a post on r/dogs yesterday about people having off-leash dogs and I mentioned my post here. Several people are trying to tell me what I should or shouldn’t do. And what I should tell the vet’s office, file a formal complaint, etc. It’s the owners that need to be held responsible. My vet’s office is doing everything they can.

Sorry for the side rant. I’m sorry your family friend didn’t listen to you. My dog does the same thing...wags his tail just before the attack. It’s not a friendly wag. People suck at reading dog body language."
reactivedogs,f0ooqht,t1_f0olmdy,1568816687.0,"My dog is muzzled when out of the house. This is why we muzzle trained him. While it’s for the protection of the dog w/ignorant owners, b/c the dog didn’t pick the idiot they live with, it’s also for my dog’s protection. I know if something happens my dog will be blamed even though I am following the law. 

The incidents we’ve had in the past, before we realized how severe his aggression was, the other owners had accepted responsibility and I saw it coming so was able to minimize the damage. No broken skin. And we weren’t in close quarters. Now, my worry is if someone attacks him he can’t defend himself."
reactivedogs,f0obpdi,t1_f0obeqz,1568805657.0,They do enforce it. As soon as someone walks in with an unleashed dog they tell them they have to put one of the leads they have hanging by the entrance on their dog. Problem is the owners let their dogs run into the clinic first and that’s more than enough time for something to happen.
dogs,f0ntq74,t3_d5rs35,1568780491.0,"I actually just made a post on r/reactivedogs about owners walking into my vet clinic with their dogs off-leash. I have a very dog-aggressive dog and he’s not the I’ll-give-you-warning type or do a couple snaps and that’s it. If the dog gets close, it’s an all out attack and he’s in it for the kill. I’ve worked with him, along with a trainer, for years so that he can be calm outside the house as well as live with my other two dogs. I know him so I know how to avoid putting him in situations where something may happen, muzzling him (he’s muzzle trained) when those situations can’t be avoided and breaking up a fight if/when, unfortunately, that does/has happened. And every incident we’ve had was while mine was on-leash, so yes, please leash your dogs. It’s for their safety."

AskVet,f0lnlia,t3_d5esdo,1568724453.0,"I’m so sorry you and your pup are going through this. If your dog is suffering the kindest thing you can to is let him go. Making this decision is the hardest part of being a dog owner and the fact that you’re struggling so much with it shows how much you love him. You are not betraying him, you are loving him to the end. In my experience, it is peaceful for them. A sedative is given first and then the drug to stop their heart. Discuss the options with your vet and make the decision you feel is right for him. You know him best. I hope whichever one you make, you eventually feel peace with."
AskVet,f0i7uj4,t3_d4zyd4,1568637501.0,"You could take him to the vet to get a check-up and see exactly what he needs. If he ends up needing treatment outside of your budget, you could possibly look for a rescue to take him in."

And what was your fiance’s co-coworker’s response to the situation? Normally dog bites are reported by medical professionals when treated, which means a mandatory quarantine for the dog."
fosterdogs,ezg8vhi,t3_d11ey5,1567893405.0,"First, who in the rescue was it reported to? Is there anyone higher up you can go to? They should be taking this much more seriously than they seem to be. 

Second, a dog doesn’t have a bite history until they do. So what that trainer said was completely moot b/c the dog now has a bite history. 

Did your fiance’s coworker get medical attention? If the dog drew blood, they really need antibiotics to prevent infection. Is the dog up-to-date on rabies and other vaccines?"
reactivedogs,ez8ljl9,t3_d0bpic,1567747675.0,"A friend of mine is the head K9 trainer for a major metropolitan police department. She has told me that grabbing the aggressor by the collar with both hands from behind, palms down, then lifting backward toward you, rotating your forearms together and squeezing until the dog calms down is the best approach. This will prevent the dog from being able to turn around and bite b/c you have control of the head/neck."

Good pictures and a cute video of her being kind of goody helps a lot. If the rescue does it, maybe make suggestions on what to add.
