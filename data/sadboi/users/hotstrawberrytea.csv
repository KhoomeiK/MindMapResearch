it takes ages for me to finish something because ""I can do better,"" even after I finish, it's still not enough! ""I still can do better"" ""oh damn, I should've......."" it's never ever enough for some reason. I'm never truly satisfied with my work.

I also procrastinate starting things just because I know that they're going to take ages for me to finish! and that I'll torture myself throughout the process. it's not a good trait to have!!

no jealousy though! I don't give a shit about what other people do. I just want to do things ""well."" and I'm just harder on myself. 

I didn't want to be my bestfriend's partner on a project once in high school, just because I know she's sloppy and impatient, and I didn't want to let that affect my work. 

also in other cases, I'll tell everyone in a group project that I'll do everything myself and they can get credit even though they didn't do anything for the project. that's really... REALLY bad.

I overlooked it all, didn't want to make a big deal because I loved him so much. I still do, not gonna lie. but looking back, I did get frustrated a lot and I wanted him to do things for me.

anyway, we broke up after 3 years and now I'm seeing a guy that truly TRULY cares about me and what I want. in the bedroom AND outside of the bedroom. it even felt weird at first because he asks me what I want all the time and I didn't know what to say because I wasn't used to it lol

you don't have to believe in these things, you know that right? it's okay to think it's BS. but a lot of us here actually find that this thing works. maybe we don't manifest things as quick as 3 days, a lot of us here are still learning and testing the law.

nevillegoddardsp,fcich4v,t3_eeai4e,1577660509.0,"> I don't know why me and my sp are not together but I manifested someone else so easily and effortlessly.

it's always so easy to manifest anything you don't have any emotional attachment to. so don't worry about it. usually when you feel that *urgency* to be with your SP like YOU WANT IT TO HAPPEN RIGHT NOW!! it stresses you out because you're constantly wondering ""when is it going to happen? but how? but what if.... etc etc"" let it go, let it happen naturally. manifesting should be fun and natural.

you manifested another person, that's awesome! take that as inspiration. think about what you did to manifest him and how you felt when you manifested him just for the fun of it. you probably didn't feel any urgency, you probably felt like it's no big deal. because you don't put him in a pedestal. get your SP off of that pedestal. it should get easier from there :)

best of luck! I know you can do it. can't wait to read your success story on how you manifested your SP ♥️♥️"

NevilleGoddard,fc25ab8,t1_fc15jd0,1577341036.0,"but everything that's ever happened in your life is manifested by you yourself. that date you went on recently? whether you did it consciously or unconsciously, you still manifested it. same as everything else."

I've always wanted to get flowers from whoever guy I'm involved with, but in 22 years no one's ever given me flowers yet. I will definitely post on here when I get flowers from my guy 💕"
nevillegoddardsp,fbw6xn5,t1_fbvskho,1577142340.0,"yeah, I personally prefer ""he can't stand the idea of not being with me, he just cant resist me"" 😁"
nevillegoddardsp,fbpt9u9,t1_fbpnmjn,1577024766.0,"yes, keep persisting! it doesn't matter what he said, don't dwell on it. you got this ♥️"
NevilleGoddard,fbps2ij,t1_fbppgno,1577024436.0,"well not everybody knows about Neville, so they're most likely unaware of the power of their subconscious. and also, not everyone's a master at this.

it takes a lot of practice, a lot of slaps on the face 😂, mental miscarriages.. it's not that easy to get used to. but it does get easier overtime. you just have to keep practicing, keep learning Neville's teachings. and one day it'll all just 'click' and you'll never go back 💛"
