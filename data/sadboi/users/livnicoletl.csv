I remember when I worked at a daycare and another co worker was pissed that I was leaving early and gave me so much attitude and I came home crying hysterically.

BPD,fmysvnx,t3_fplacn,1586494757.0,"It's the worst.  Any friendship/romantic relationship breakup I've experienced would be unending pain for me. I remember growing up and bring like at some point I should be over that relationship but instead I would dwell and dwell on them. That's when I started therapy at 17 and the funny thing is a Dr wanted me to be on meds and my mom said I was too young, fast forward to being 22 and had suicidal thoughts and suddenly I was ready for meds... Anyways I'm getting off topic, every relationship ending or any kind of heartbreak the only thing that works for me is distracting myself, with bpd emotions get the best of us. I usually put on music and as I listen to the music I write out a lyric that speaks to me. I can do it for hours, I've been doing it since I was in middle school. It helps express emotions and it's a mindfulness activity. Vent to people, I know the pandemic is crazy, but keep in touch with friends being alone is not going to help anybody right now especially borderlines, and reading this subreddit is getting me through some heartbreak as well."
BPD,fmx32ac,t3_f1qnzy,1586457585.0,I'm so sorry. I have to do group therapy now bc they took away my individual therapy when I was hospitalized. I was so upset because I liked my therapist and I don't see group being helpful for bpd patients at all.

Going through major trauma (my husband tried to kill himself a month ago and I found him) plus this pandemic has me not working. And my meds are just not kicking in. So I'm getting irritable and angry and self harming because I feel like I'm not being myself. I am so so sick, I can't watch violent things at all either! And blood grosses me out terribly yet when I cut deep in my wrist I have no desire to clean it. I'm pushing and getting aggressive I actually got held down last night by my husband and had to spend the night in the hospital. He says ""I'm overdramatic and attention seeking."" But if he really understood how hard it is to have this disorder I would hope he wouldn't say that. He also disappeared before the cops came and the ambulance came so I got sent to the hospital without him even looking at me. It was horrible."
BPD,fmnxcbu,t3_fw5x9x,1586238092.0,"That's literally what I want. Theres so much going on in my life right now, besides the virus that is causing me to have episodes like crazy. And everyone around me keeps reminding me that my thoughts are because of my bpd and blablabla. I just want to talk to others who have thoughts that get the best of them, regardless if they're real or not. Someone who gets irrationally angry and can understand that I get the way that I do, and not look at me like I'm possessed by a demon. Someone who understands self-harm. I'm in therapy I'm taking meds, but it hasn't kicked in just yet. I'm constantly looking for validation."
BPD,fmnunq1,t3_eah7az,1586235781.0,"this is how I'm currently feeling right now as well, I've had bpd for a long time and I'm dumb and went off my meds tried different meds that didn't work, experienced a traumatic event (I found my husband unconscious bc he tried to kill himself) and my BPD symptoms all at once flared way more up through the traumatic event and now I have to wait till my meds kick in and I'm doing dbt but that's going to take a year. When will I feel any better? It scares me I really dont feel that I can keep feeling this way it's a scary feeling and it feels like the people I love most are not in the mood to be supportive or really helpful, they walk on eggshells towards me which just gets me more angry."
BPD,fmntt0i,t3_dvvusa,1586235089.0,"Im so sorry, being in war with our thoughts is literally the most painful experience ever.  I get the same way with my husband, and lately I've been having paranoid thoughts about his parents.  He doesn't handle them very well either, just defends his parents and doesnt address that I'm feeling this way other than that. Its killing me because its causing so many fights, and everytime his parents call I freak out. His parents aren't too nice to me which makes it so much harder, but who knows maybe that's all in my head too. I think the worst thing about us and these thoughts is nobody understands how much it kills us to have these thoughts and they dont validate them often which just makes us angrier and more insecure. I'm here for you, paranoid thoughts drown me and I think its the worst symptom of BPD."

Like I constantly talk about this hobby and make it my life so of course they're gonna try it because I was so enthusiastic about it and basically egged it on them especially when your friends know how it is with bpd and how emotional we can get so they're like well this hobby is making her happy so I should try it too. And then I'm like they're copying me cant they get their own hobby?
BPD,fmnm9mx,t3_fwa760,1586229400.0,"I feel you, I develop so many hobbies and become obsessed with them to seem more different, and then when people get impressed by it and want to get into it too I move onto something else and think everyone copied my hobby..but the truth of the matter is I cant stick with a hobby/trend for too long, I consider that all part of the unstable self image/sense of self. Like I'm not sure of who I am or what I actually like and why I like it other than just to be different."

BPD,fmlrs1f,t3_fvs1hi,1586192032.0,I am in need of it myself. I found one or two videos of peoples story's with bpd.

BPD,fmlq94k,t1_fmln8wx,1586191228.0,"Thank you so much.

BPD,fmlpr1s,t1_fmloyk4,1586190967.0,"It's the worst, I always wonder if I expect too much of him but idk I feel like defending me isn't a lot to ask for and validating my thoughts isn't a lot to ask for. He has zero tolerance for my mood swings and says I'm overdramatic. Doesnt help me through them, he just walks away and tells me hes not dealing with it. Meanwhile my bpd has gotten worse these past couple of weeks because 3 weeks ago i found him unconscious covered in vomit bc he tried to kill himself, I could have said whatever I'm not dealing with this too, but I called 911 and called his parents and he has completely shut me out doesnt want to talk at all about it he wants to pretend it never happened."
BPD,fmllqyk,t1_fmlkuvv,1586188872.0,"Thank you so much, it's so hard to talk to people who don't have or understand bpd, my own husband thinks I'm being attention seeking. It's the worst feeling in the world."

BPD,flxy8o8,t3_framg2,1585592089.0,"Omg I always want to do this I go through phases, it's the worst feeling ever.

I dont think that will happen, I think they're gonna get rid of jennifer because it seems like after this season nobody will want to film with her. I find her hilariously entertaining but they all seem to have a huge problem with her drinking. Jackie has done several press for the show which means she is popular and she's the one person who is feuding with Teresa, without her it's just gonna be melissa vs Teresa drama all over again"

I also feel like at this point all the melissa and teresa drama should be over, and I think jackie is the pot stirrer to get them fighting again. She brings up teresa and the guy and seems to really hate teresa and constantly makes digs at her and then gets upset about not being invited to a day honoring teresa? She annoys me, especially dropping the word bully constantly like she's just as much of a bully as anyone else on the show. I'm team melissa but I'm not a fan of jackie"
