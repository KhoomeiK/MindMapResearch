LucidDreaming,fqu5tx7,t3_gkye4h,1589652599.0,"An interesting question! For me it is playing on the background the way a movie soundtrack would, not localized anywhere.

Music genres seem to change with the theme of the dream, it can be anything from heavy metal to samba to opera to eerie piano music or anything else.

Often they are stuck in my head after waking up and a couple of times I have got up to record them on my phone so I could use them later.

I should have put it that Rcs check your reality so that you know for sure when you are dreaming so you know to do all the dream intentions then. It is hard to realize when you're not awake, which is why this is such a complicated skill to learn sometimes."
LucidDreaming,fqqge3q,t1_fqqfkie,1589565061.0,"Not at all, buddy. You already have free will, reality check does exactly what the name implies. You try something that would not work out in real life (like pushing your finger through your palm), thus confirming it is a dream instead of reality. That way you don't accidentally do unintended things awake.

Also it often serves a purpose as bringing clarity into your dream and stabilizes it. Your logical mind (which is surprisingly hard to use in a dream) has much easier time to keep you in control when things are clear to you.

Happy dreaming!"

My two cents:

Plugging my nose and trying to breath has never failed for me. It's my number one.

Pushing a finger through my palm usually has enough results (at least my hand stretching from it) to work.

Looking at my hands is simple, works also well as a dream stabilizer when you examine them closely.

Mirrors work, but can be creepy/weird enough that they steer you away from your goals. Use with care.

Light switches don't work as they should and are a really good way to realize it's a dream. Can also be applied to other electric things as well.

I remember one user telling (s)he always bites her tongue and that it works like a charm every time. Haven't tested it myself but it sounds good, especially because of it's subtlety. No one knows if you do it, even in front of people."

WritingPrompts,fohp8n4,t3_g7h7dv,1587769982.0,"A bit skinny redguard man in a hide armor and a brown hood steps up hastily to the podium set up at the back of The Bannered Mare. The tavern has a few extra benches set up for the special occasion and Hulda is tending the bar, barely paying attention to what is going on. She was surprised enough when the man had asked her to close the tavern for a day for a private gathering, but she was sure the people of Whiterun wouldn't hold it against her since the man paid her well. A banner with letters SAA is hanging on the wall behind the podium, weawed with such detail and golden linings it can only be from Radiant Raiment in Solitude.
 
The man at the podium pulls her hood down and looks at the audience. He had hoped for more people this year, but no matter how he tried, most adventurers dislike the idea of being labeled as stealth archers, always claiming that they do other stuff too and only use their bow for taking down bandits outside the sword's reach. The man goes through his papers, his hands shaking a bit, and sips from the pint of mead Saadia has brought him a bit earlier. The man glances at the hunting bow and the satchel of potions of invisibility he has left at the corner of the room and coughs a few times before straightening his back.

""Damn ataxia..."" He mumbles and takes another sip from the pint, holding it with his both hands to keep it still. He puts the pint down and begins. ""All right, I welcome you all to the annual meeting of Stealth Archers Anonymous. My name is Ahtkim and I will be opening this year's seminar. This year's theme is 'Are fireballs just a poor man's substi'... Aargh!"" the man flinches and ducks behind the podium as an arrow, clearly aimed at his pint, splits it in half and spills it's contents all over him.

""All right, WHO DID THAT??"" Ahtkim gets up and stares angrily at the crowd. The crowd snickers as the arrow on is still wagging at the wall behind him. ""Come on! I want the shooter to stop crouching right now and show himself!""

""Maybe it was just the wind!"" A guy shouts from the back row. The crowd bursts into laughter as Ahtkim is staring at them helplessly.

Hulda shakes her head, but brings Ahtkim a piece of cloth so he can wipe himself clean. Ahtkim nods and starts to clean himself up. ""You're going to have to pay for that pint!"" Hulda says as she returns to tend to the bar. ""Yeah, yeah, of course I am.."" Ahtkim says and looks at his papers. ""Oh, now look at what you've done!"" Ahtkim picks up his notes from a pool of spilt mead on the podium and holds them up, showing the dripping wet, ruined papers to the audience. ""Now how can we get on with the conference?!""

""Oh, shut up.. nobody came here to listen to your speeches. We're here for the mead!"" A nord from the audience answers and grins, looking around at the dozen or so people around him nodding agreeingly.

""But... But... I had planned an archery contest.."" Ahtkim pleads to the audience, looking desperately for any approving faces.

""Oh yeah? And how could we tell the winner in a STEALTH ARCHER'S contest?"" The nord snaps back and the audience giggles. ""Let's just put the benches around the fire and have fun!""

""Besides the arrow on the back wall already confirms who's the winner."" Someone else states and the crowd mumbles and gets up and start to move the benches.

Ahtkim sighs and turns around. He pulls the banner down from the back wall and meekly tugs at the arrow next to it. ""I should have got the Dragonborn to be the opening speaker for the day..."" He murrs quietly. ""I bet no-one would have aimed their bow at HIM! Only that the stubborn fool keeps insisting he uses his sword from time to time and isn't really a stealth archer..."""
internetparents,fohf6xs,t3_g7cf6q,1587764920.0,"I am in no way a professional so take this with a pinch of salt, but a lot of it sounds like a coping mechanism. Good for you for doing things that are good for you, but something might have you escaping bad feeling with unhealthy behavior.

The situation sounds like you do bad stuff and feel bad about it --> you decide it's okay because you did something good so it's okay --> your reasoning isn't waterproof so you end up feeling bad anyway --> you do something good eventually and that gives you the reason to go back to unhealthy behavior. It's a nasty circle.

If this has been the way you act for a while, then the habit is quite strong and hard to break completely. What might help is to start with something you want to change in this. Maybe you want to fix your sleep schedule first or your eating habits or keep your kitchen clean. It's up to you. Once you have decided on something, concentrate on making a difference in that and forming a new, healthier habit with determinate little changes. 

Don't try to change your life at once, that is almost impossible without a very strong incentive to do so. Decide to improve this one thing and be mindful at how it makes you feel. You will be taking control of yourself and showing yourself what an improvement in your habits does to your well-being. Starting to work on the next thing is that much easier later. If you start that now, in one month you'll have a clean kitchen, better sleep schedule or whatever else you decided to pursue and have a good reason to feel good about yourself. Not only that, but you'll have a feeling of being in control of your own life too. In two months, you will have done something else you feel needs improving and have a clearer outlook on what your life has already and what it needs next. In a year you can have a whole new set of habits, newly found self determination and a clearer head since it's no more constantly swamped by all the things left undone.

The longer you go around this current circle, the harder it will be to break out. This circle is easy to return to for a long time because you already know how to do it and you know it will bring you some quick gratification. Decide where you will have an exit out of it and start forming something else instead."

A good starting point to this is to start examining your ego and finding out how big part that is to your problem. After negative events it is often our egos that hold on to the pain and say ""we were treated wrong, we deserve to feel this way."" and our logical minds are left struggling to reason back that ""yeah, but we can't change what happened and dragging the useless pain with us, however deserved, hinders us when going forward."" 

You probably know already that you would be feeling better if you didn't carry the grudge with you, it is heavy luggage on your journey. Leaving it behind won't mean you would leave behind anything it taught to you. You get to keep moving on and you get to be wiser for it, and you'll be that much more awesome person to yourself and all the others you'll meet on your journey.

It make me smile to think that since I can't make it to the gym now, I can again do something that you designed. I can't wait to see how this works out.

I've taught weightlifting to an acrobat, runners and dancers alike and they've found it beneficial to their sport.

First of all if you're looking to get into sports, I would suggest picking one that inspires you and that feels like it would keep you interested. No matter if it's bodybuilding or badmington, the first rule is it has to inspire YOU or you'll end up stopping your training and feel bad about not going forever after.

You can always expand to other fields or change it completely later if needed, just keep doing your thing. You'll improve yourself physically and mentally anyway and will feel good about yourself no matter your sport.

Best sport is a sport that keeps you coming back.

AskReddit,fiq6fcs,t3_f99imt,1582636494.0,"Minecraft

I'm over thirty, but it's so much fun to casually explore and build stuff while listening to podcasts and learning new things.

I wouldn't ever end up just listening to them while doing nothing for long, but playing Minecraft gives me enough to do to keep myself entertained for hours.

I'm not even an introverted person so it baffles me a bit. Maybe it brings me back to my childhood and building things from Legos and maybe it's a bit about the survival aspects.

Another funny aspect of it is that if you took the possibility of listening to podcasts away, it wouldn't be fun to play it anymore. Together, it all just works.

I believe people can do great things to others as well as gain great personal rewards by being good at what they do. Being evil is often the shortcut to things, but also affects your personality and your relationships to others. That's the prize to pay for shortcuts like that.

Taking the longer way, refining your character and striving for good takes effort as well as understanding. The positive side in that is it often leads to both good rewards as well as being happier about yourself and having those around you look up to you too."

Stoicism,fimepji,t1_fime4bk,1582527324.0,"I would start with self reflection to refine to yourself how you feel, followed by sitting down and talking about it with your SO or a friend. It would be helpful for you to get to work through those feelings, since repressing them works only so far.

With this much emotional load, I would say this is ahead of you at some point anyway, might as well get it underway before you meet your father for best results with the meeting."
Stoicism,fimdu3k,t3_f8mzbi,1582526388.0,"You already know what is going to happen and you know he won't be able to help it. You can choose what you do, though. Going through this in your mind in advance and sorting out what you need from that conversation will help you get ready for it.

It's clear from what you wrote that there is a huge emotional load involved in your thinking. It sounds like you have reasons for it, but in the upcoming conversation with your father it will hinder your efforts. It would be best to work through those emotions beforehand so they won't be affecting your behavior when you meet with him.

You already defined your next goal (new job) and figured what you need for it to happen (one week's pay). This is what you are working towards. What your father says or thinks, your performance in his eyes or how you feel about working for him are not factors in that, so don't let your mind get sidetracked with such matters. When you get a new job and have a stable income from it, your current emotions and anger become less important.

If you let your emotions govern you now and go to the meeting fuming with anger, you will do significantly worse. Work through that stuff in advance and make sure you know what you are trying to achieve from that meeting. Good luck."
