I have been doing these workouts at home -

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=1RbdiqZHg3s - for upper body

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=erKJOb51bCI - for lower body.

Of course you can add a few more exercises and do it longer if you find it easy.

I also do some odd things throughout the house. So for example, when I'm making a tea, I do some dips on the kitchen counter table. This will be good for your chest, triceps and shoulders. 

This workout is really good for abs - https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=DHD1-2P94DI

It is important though that you eat healthy and sleep well to build muscle. Good quality food is much more important than a lot of people think and you need to be eating more calories than you burn throughout the day to gain weight. I find this getting enough calories difficult and enough sleep (my family is cursed with poor sleep lol).

But, all I would say is to try and increase your fat take. 
You could start by adding peanut butter in your shakes and olive oil.
Or maybe just eating peanut butter (or something similar) out of the jar. It will be a struggle at first, but the more you do it, the more you'll get used to it. Just spend about 15 minutes eating a bit at a time. 

You could also give this a try. Set an alarm at different parts of the day for when you have to eat something (or a shake). So spread it out over 6 hours a day or whatever and make it your goal to get a good amount of calories in you. I know you say it is a real struggle but your going to be a real mental battle to force yourself into hitting these targets.

Edit - have you tried eating bananas? They are pretty soft and easy to eat when nice and yellow (bit soft) and they will have around 100 calories per one."
