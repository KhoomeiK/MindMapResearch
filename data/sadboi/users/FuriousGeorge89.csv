SuicideWatch,foxn7bi,t3_ga3rak,1588149420.0,"You’re not thinking clearly. You’re not gonna solve anything by making your surviving loved ones have to deal with your death. Put down the gun, lie down in a way that you won’t choke to death on your own vomit, and sleep it off. You’ve told us you’re super drunk, so saying “you’ll feel better in the morning” is very likely not true. You will feel better once you’re no longer hung over. Maybe stay away from the alcohol for a while and do something you enjoy."

I don’t know you and I never knew your sister, by if she were alive today, I don’t think she’d want you to hurt yourself over something that wasn’t your fault. Your parents are terrible for blaming you for this. You are a good person and you deserve to be alive."
