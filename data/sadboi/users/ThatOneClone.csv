Hyundai,fqdd7jd,t1_fqbdjke,1589286974.0,"Honestly love it. I use the adaptive cruise control w/LKA every single day on the highway. It makes riding highways not as attention draining on me in the morning on my commutes. 

I did also test drive a 2020 model 3 Tesla before buying the sonata, and I would say the model 3s Autopilot worked much better, felt more solid. Except the interior quality of the model 3 was very much lacking compared to my sonata. But the sonata does great, it does make a few steering corrections and if the road is bad quality with fading lines it’s impossible to use it of course."

If I try to eat anything I throw it up almost immediately, and if I don’t have anything in my stomach it’s just bile.

Being around her was unlike anything I ever experienced, I just loved everything about her. Where I really messed up was not letting her breathe after, constantly messaging etc. tbh I knew I was pathetic, and looking back now it was terrible what I did. Don’t do that, let her have space. 

What helped me move on, and focus on myself, granted it took a few years for me, was I looked at myself and what really interested me. I love video games? I got more into video games, built my own gaming computer as a project. I wanted to learn to cook, so I got a couple books and learned to do that. I never really had a group of friends so I endured my anxiety and joined a church group in college. Find something you’re interested in and pursue it! Start a new show or movie series.

If you don’t do it the message turns red and idk what happens after that I never tested it. 

Sometimes it’s 20 seconds, I’ve been 10 minutes without it telling me anything just going down the highway with curves and everything. It makes driving my morning and night commute incredibly easier. Only thing here in Texas, the highway I go on is two lanes same direction, left left is the passing/fast lane so if I’m going HDA with auto steering I’m going the speed limit 70 mph. Cars get on my butt fast so I move over, and now I’m stuck behind 18 wheelers going 60, or work trucks flinging rocks etc off their trucks. In the Right lane my 2020 sonata limited sometimes tries to take the exits off the highway from that right lane, so I have to hold the steering wheel to make sure it doesn’t happen. Sometimes it turns a little as if it’s about to take the exit than veers straight. Never had that problem in the left fast lane"
