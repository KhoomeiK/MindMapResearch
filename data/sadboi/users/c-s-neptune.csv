I already don't talk to my dad for other reasons (his narcissism), so if my mother can't accept who I am, as much as I idolize her and love her, I can walk away from her too and be okay eventually.  I survived it once, I can do it again.  I haven't broken into actually dating yet, but now that I know for sure who I am, I know what I want now and that is also just so damn wonderful. The only choice in the matter that I have made was to live my best life from now on. You can do this."
latebloomerlesbians,fany1w1,t3_c8a7pf,1576253202.0," **Current age:** 29

**Single/marital status:** Single, never married, no kids.

**Age/age range when you came out to yourself:** Literally just yesterday.

**Age/age range when you come out to others:** Last week to my friends. However every time throughout my life that I even hypothetically posed the idea that I was gay to my mother, she would always respond with ""But you're not"". She accepted that I was pan-sexual recently, so until I am fully comfortable with my life, I won't try again.

**What did you come out as:** Lesbian af

**When was the earliest you felt you were a lesbian/queer? What happened or what was going on in your life?:** When I was attracted to Michael Jackson, but I had no idea he was a he until someone told me. I was like, 4. Then I think that's where my confusion was perpetuated. I am tragically attracted to androgynous women and only remember twice in my life that I was truly attracted to someone. They were both exactly that. 

**What recently made you conclude you are a lesbian/queer?:** My last ex-boyfriend once said to me that I never looked at him the way I did other women. I have been single since like July? I don't even remember now. But then all of my private sexual predilections say I am just trying to do mental gymnastics to avoid being actually attracted to women. I stayed in long toxic female friendships because it turns out I was in love with them, but all of my queerness has been subconscious until I really thought about it. I am basically almost the entirety of the Comphet master doc. On top of having the neighborhood kids  play pretend and when my neighbor's older sister, who was playing a man dumped me, it wrecked me more than if it was actually a boy. All of my desire to be admired like other girls by men was because I was never validated by anyone when I was younger. Way too much to type, jesus.

**What's the earliest or most defining homosexual/homo-romantic experience you can remember?:** At 17, getting the first opportunity to kiss a girl and feeling more scared in my entire life and then backing out because of it. I just shut down my gay and said no this wasn't for me. I really liked that girl.

**How are you feeling in general about who you are?:** At peace. I have done a lot of growing over the last few months. I denied ever enacting self harm while I was depressed, but me dating men was my version of cutting. But now that I am medicated for depression, my world has opened up to me and I can see so clearly. I am happy for the first time in my life. Everything inside of me has been fitting into place, then there was just this one last thing. Now I know I don't have to ever do that again because I know who I am now. And that is the most beautiful thing I could have ever asked for in my life. Baby me would be so reassured if she could see me now.

**Anything else you‚Äôd like to share about your life, experience, or story for other late bloomers or other women who think they may be lesbians?** Your feelings are not criminal. We have all fallen into the trap of heteronormativity in all manner of different ways. Whether it's familial shame or because that's what the world pounds into our head from birth as women. We just accept the lie that's fed to us, because we're raised to be nice not assertive for what actually want for ourselves. Your path is your path, don't ever let a single person, including you, shame you for it."

But I've been forcing myself past friendship with men my whole life.
