LucidDreaming,f6udltw,t3_dsy4k8,1573161437.0,"CONVINCE yourself that you can dream. Staying negative about having any dreams won't help you. I can try to give you advice.

1. It's all in your head.
Dreaming isn't like a physical thing that you can control like you can control a car, or play a video game. Dreams are in your head, and even though hitting an engine with a wrench might help it, that doesn't mean that hitting your head will give you more dreams xd. Instead with dreams, you can convince your mind that you are dreaming, and you will eventually (with practice) dream.

2. Perhaps you just can't remember them.
Dreams can be very tricky. You could wake up in the middle of the night sweating with terror, yet not remembering a thing about your nightmare. So the only advice I can give you about this is to keep a dream journal, and whenever you wake up, write whatever you saw down in your journal (EVEN IF YOU CAN'T REMEMBER ANYTHING). I remember when I forget to write in my dream journal and I can barely remember anything about my dreams. But if I start again, then within a week, I get the most vivid dreams I've ever had.

3. Everyone has the capability of dreaming.
We, no matter who we are all have the ability to lucid dream, let alone dream normally. If you stay confident in this fact, your subconscious mind will pick up on this and perhaps give you a dream tonight!

This is all the help that I can give you. Just remember to think about dreams to give your subconscious mind a nudge in the right direction.

Good luck."

LucidDreaming,eyxdjqj,t3_cz8l3g,1567550653.0,"This is one of the things I want in lucid dreaming. I want full control over my mind, personify every aspect of my mind so I can summon them wherever, and possibly control my body as well. 

I want to also do something tricky: I want to merge my conscious and subconscious minds together. The brain is made up of 10% conscious mind, and 90% subconscious mind. Imagine the possibilities of being in absolute control.

My ULTIMATE goal in lucid dreaming is to create some... reality that transcends this one. A ""world"" that is completely original, and powerful. This world will have no up, no down, no light, no dark, it will instead be replaced with new unknown vistas that the normal person could never understand. I hope you understand the message I am trying to get across. Forget everything about the world and construct a new one, as if you knew nothing about color or dimensions. I hope I don't sound crazy or anything, but this is my ultimate goal.

I believe that lucid dreams can do ANYTHING."

LucidDreaming,ey8pgml,t3_cw0chh,1566925343.0,"I had a dream, not a lucid dream but just a regular dream. I was going through some hard times and was very defensive about myself, and I even saw this in my dreams. The dream was where I went up to a house in the woods, and there was a monster or a witch that lived there. I tried getting in the house, but the monster kept finding me and killing me. Me and my friends were seeing if we could find the secret of the house, but every time I died, time reset and I was back at the mansion. I was powerless against the monster. 

But the first thing I noticed was that I was not scared of the monster. Whenever I died I always came back. The monster left the house and started chasing me. In fear, I ran down the path from the house, and it was gaining on me. I was done for...

NO.

I turned around and chased the monster with intense rage, and the monster shrunk to half its size, and I chased it faster than it was chasing me. The monster was no longer chasing me; I was chasing the MONSTER. Before it could even get close to its house, I grabbed it by its arm, and pinned it to the ground. I felt intense power under my control, and it was exhilarating. I gave one last look at the monster-witch, and snapped its neck. The weird thing was that when I usually kill something in my dream, I am not sure if it is really dead, I think it may chase after me when I look away. But not this time. After hearing the satisfying crunch of the monster, it didn't even move, but its limbs went limp, and I KNEW it was dead. It was such a weird and vivid experience to literally feel something die in your hands. But after it was done, I slowly bent back up, feeling powerful, and looked at my friends. I had no desire to attack them. Shortly after, the dream ended.

The lesson is that no matter how powerless you feel in your dream, remember that you are god inside your own mind. You can do anything. In fact, the reason the dream ended was not because of fear or shock, but because the dream revolved around the monster-witch. And when I killed it, I killed the dream. The interesting thing was that after the dream ended, my chain of nightmares about being chased came to an abrupt stop. So remember, whenever you are feeling week inside a dream, or being bullied by dream characters, remember to show them who you are. Show them that in your mind, YOU are god. (In the dream of course) I hope this encourages you!"
