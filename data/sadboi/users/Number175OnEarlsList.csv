Again to the downvoters, I know it wasn't a medium question but this was divine timing. Im sorry it was an actual issue instead of the normal please read my cards for free question. I'm sorry if my question and this commenters kind and thoughtful reply to someone clearly in distress caused you to doubt your status as a medium, as your only true talent is for divining tarot cards. I hope that you continue to learn and grow your craft as the planet does need light workers and healers and these talents will be much more useful to the collective than parlor tricks with cards.

TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fqh0rjv,t1_fqgxs6h,1589363857.0,Unless maybe it triggered hormones or she may deeply regret it. That happened to my mom's oldest sister. She had an abortion at like 18 because she was only 18 and not ready to settle down. She ended up going into the military a while and marrying the guy who got her pregnant. They tried for years due a baby after that with no luck. It caused deep mental trauma so bad she isolated for years. She still will break down crying when she sees a newborn

I've always had insomnia but it's insane since I came off of long- term benzos in February. No taper because my doc was mad at me for getting a medical marijuana card. I had several provoked seizures and was hospitalized. I do have PTSD from severe prolonged child abuse. I'm 38 now but again I've always had these issues. I think it's why I got so dependent on the benzos. It was at the hospital that my medical team saw first hand my sleep issue but no one can get to a cause or cure. I've literally tried everything. Have you ever had a patient like me? Did they ever get over this in a way that didn't involve any type of drugs and how? Coming off the way I did almost killed me and I never want to be in that place again.

Sucks that his burns are on his arm, eyes, and forehead. He grabbed a blanket and tried to put the fire out which caught fire and wrapped around him. He's having trouble opening his eyes but they're keeping him comfortable pain wise. He's super super grumpy and depressed which is very uncharacteristic for him, but expected in the circumstances. Still it's jarring hearing my dad sound and talk like this when he's the happiest man I know. He sounds exactly like my depressed brother sounds like who has a ton of issues (of his own making.) It's just weird. He's antsy and doesn't like people taking care of him and wants a cigarette. He thinks he's going home tonight or tomorrow and refuses to hear anything else. They still have to determine if the burns are third or second degree, because I guess that affects his treatment plan for when he DOES go home. We haven't told him that his foster dog passed away.

Methadone,fjbrf1c,t1_fjagrer,1583199776.0,"I am going through hell and you are correct, I am w/d from Benzos along with this ride so I'm hating life right about now. It's funny because my actual doctor, of 20 years, is the one who got me in this predicament in the first place, over- prescribing me these terribly addictive medicines and then becoming angry at me acquiring my medical marijuana license and abruptly stopping my medication. While I take responsibility in that I should have been more on top of my health and paying attention to exactly what I was taking and any long term effects, I also am a busy mom, grandma, wife, and college student and I trusted the man who went to medical school over my general Accountant knowledge. He is a very religious man and I am in the South and while I've grown away from the fairy tales, I put up with his heavy handedness for years as par for the course but his wrecklessness almost killed me. In fact, I did leave my body during one of the seizure episodes and I'll hopefully be ready to talk about that experience someday, but in all essence, he literally DID kill me. Now, due to my seizures I am no longer driving, causing me to have to drop out of school and also takes away from time with my grand- daughter. And it was all over legally prescribed marijuana that I don't even smoke. (FYI I consume oils under the tongue at bedtime and am most certainly NOT using to be intoxicated and spray paint graffiti all over town. Although, this is America and we voted for this and we pay taxes and if people want to smoke, smoke up. All good.)
Due to this whole situation, I am understandably leery of any doctor at this point, as mine showed me that his anger and fear of not being able to prescribe addictive drugs since more people are turning to the natural healing properties of marijuana was more important than my life ultimately. Luckily, I had an excellent staff in the hospital at my most recent visit and they were concerned with my health before all else. Even they admitted that they're kinda in unfamiliar territory with me but that with legalization, they would expect to see more and more people like me turn up. It's sad but now I'm getting a little political so let me stop that now. No one can tell me exactly what symptoms I'm going to experience or how long it will take my body to fully recover so it's going to be learn as we go and I'm grateful for this sub- everyone has been so helpful and welcoming. For now, the doctors have prescribed me AIDS medicine to give me an appetite and my focus is on getting through this, gaining some weight, and becoming a healthier version of me. I have a great support team at home and have been practicing yoga for my mind and body. (The me from 2 years ago would laugh so hard at yoga but it has truly been a Godsend.) Thanks for checking in with me. It makes me feel good and loved and safe and talking in the subs is a great cure for boredom and I'm having lots of that. My seizure alert bracelet came today and I have a referral to a neurologist so I'm slowly readjusting to what life is for me now. Stay healthy everyone and anyone is welcome to shoot me a DM for questions or advice or even just to shoot the shit. We got this!"
