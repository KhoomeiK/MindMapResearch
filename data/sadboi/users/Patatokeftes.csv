bjj,fqis7ss,t3_gixbsh,1589400165.0," Gordon Ryan which is literally the best no gi grappler in the world at the moment basically does bodybuilding for S&C. Many other top level competitors do so aswell. Nicky Rod is argueably the most athletic no-gi grappler and he uses a bodybuilding aproach as well. Some words to the wise here:

* Yes he does Bodybuilding but if all you care about is your performance then obviously this isnt the optimal way. If they did sport specific workouts they would indeed perform better and not look as good. So you should determine what is more important for you: Looks or Performance. You can certainly balance it in a way that makes you both look good and perform well. If they can get away with it then you can too!
*  Most elite level competitors take PEDS (Gordon admitedly does). You should take this into consideration on the results you will get on your looks and your performance. That said I dont think it makes that much difference and im pretty sure that without PEDS you can certainly achieve similar results if everything else is done properly, its not like the ONLY reason they look like that is PEDS (contrary to popular belief).

All in all I think since most guys you see in adcc are super muscle dudes you can have your desired look and perform well without that restricting you."

 What annoys me when I watch an instructional is when details are missing and certain reactions your opponent will give are not addressed, or even worse when the details of a move are ambiguous. Danaher is often guilty of that and thats why I generally prefer Ryan's dvds.

I also dont like repeating the same thing over and over. Its a dvd, I can rewind to watch the same detail, if the second time explained is identical to the first, not adding anything new then its pointless.

 I invest a lot of time in instructionals and I want after investing a day on a move to know exactly what im doing wrong so next time I can fix it. 

I dont know about backround music. I believe the move should be demonstrated to add context to the explanation, if theres already context I dont care if it is demonstrated beforehand.

 When it comes to attacking legs you can either attack the near leg by entering into cross ashi garami. You can also attack the far leg with cross body ride - style rolling backtakes assuming you can isolate it.

As for upper body attacks you can attack the near elbow with armbars (low percentage entries from there) or triangles. You can also set up kimuras to the near side arm which lead to pretty much every high percentage submission to the upper body. 

For attacking the far arm usually people circle to north south to attack it. Provided you can lift that elbow with an underhook you can attack kimuras triangles armbars back takes or whatever you prefer."

Yes I do focus on a similar game as well. 90% of my game comes from Gordons and Danahers DVDs, Im in a situation where most of my training I have to do alone even pre covid (Not getting as much sparring as I can) My top game is basically his passing dvd and my top pins game I created based on his ADCC2019 analysis as well as some arm isolation techniques \[basically the afformentioned ratchet\] you can find in Johns armbar DVD, that said I never use them for armbars but for backtake). Like I said you can find Gordon explaining this in decent detail if you find he released it for free on youtube or instagram. Im pretty sure its on the match against Lachlan. If you cant find it I may be able to pm you a link.

Obviously the best resource for what he does is the DVDs of him and Danaher. A decent free resource is RVVBJJ who did some analysis of what gordon does. You will occasionally find some BJJ technique in Gordons instagram amongst the ... other stuff. He also answers questions regarding BJJ quite often."

 Im not making fun of the Americana from personal experience. Believe it or not I had a lot of success with it inspecially back when I was a whitebelt, but I stopped doing it when I noticed no high level guy ever tapped to it, because I have tapped a lot of guys in my gym with americana it doesnt mean it works. I also found that escaping it myself was quite easy indeed (The only americana that I know of thats legit is from ushiro sankaku but your opponent is with one foot on the grave already at that point).

bjj,foqn02j,t1_foqk6v7,1587997044.0," Well, there is a reason literally nobody ever in high level competition tapped to the Americana, all they have to do is bridge towards the trapped arm and slip the elbow. The breaking mechanics are not bad but they are certainly inferior to the Kimura, because of the tremendous pressure it puts on the elbow."
bjj,foqel00,t3_g8dxjv,1587991682.0,"Ill divide this long ""essay"" into top bottom and standing position. What we have to understand is that almost all of his backtakes occur from top position, with standing position being seconds and bottom position being third. The usual sequence is guard->sweep to top-> Guard pass->Mount->Isolate an arm-> Take the back

The no1 method he uses is what Danaher calls ""the ratchet"" from mounted position. You dont need his dvds you can find him talking about it in some videos on youtube and/or instagram. If I had to some it up in a few words I would sauy he gets an underhook and a crossface from mount and walks the opponents arm up to isolate it by extending the underhooking arm and moving the opponents elbow up to the shoulderline, or preferably even higher. From there he goes for a claw grip to do a katagatame which is easy to take the back from there or he goes straight to a figure four head and arm (basically a kimura seatbelt).

With this out of the way we have clarified that from mount he has an extremely high chance to take the back, if you take something from his backtaking game take that, that is what constitutes the majority of his backtakes, and what he personally says is the most high percentage method (Creating back esxposure from top pins).

The cruel truth about most backtakes that occur in the sport of jiujitsu is that they dont occur because the back taker created back exposure but because the opponent created back exposure for themselves. Point systems that most tournaments use encourage turning your back into turtle over playing a bottom pin, and that is how a lot of backtakes occur.

That brings us into a the leg drag position (what Danaher calls the flank position) from there your opponent is in a dillema of either playing from bottom side control or turtling. In points competiion everyone choses to play turtle because it doesnt immediately concede points. In ADCC2019 against Garry Tonon he also used a rolling backtake from there. It is similar to everything related to the crab ride, but he doesnt use it very often.

It may be time to mention here that from cross ashi garami when his opponent builds to an elbow because they are scared of his leglocks he can take the back from there via T-Kimura.

So to sum up most of his top game backtakes are either from mount or from a leg drag position, when he is in an opponents guard he looks to pass to get to either one of those two.

Since we clarified that he is effective in taking the back from top pins now we understand that effective passing is all he needs to get there. His passing game primarily consists of passing from a stacked position, from half guard where his opponent is chest to chest and his no1 method of passing is float passing. In youtube RVV BJJ did a decent breakdown of his float passing. He obviously does more techniques like he showed in his dvd but those 3 would be the 3 areas of guard passing per say he uses more often than anything. If I had to sum up his passing I would say he looks to get a straight hamstring inside foot and then either pommel to a pass or go to half guard chest to chest and pass from there, and look for stack passing when the opponent high legs. This is oversimplifying it but my comment is already huge.

From what we already discussed we see that once he gets any sort of top position he has a clear path that leads to the opponents back.

Now for the standing position. He doesnt use leg takedowns much, really. He uses a takedown from a tightwaist to land him to a half guard passing position that leads him to mount and therefore the back quite often. What constitutes lets say the ""core"" of his backtakes from standing position is snap downs to the front headlock. From the front headlock there is a lot of back exposure he exploits. Its worth mentioning that ppl from the standing position will also create back exposure for themselves due to how the point structure is, and he often takes advantage of that.

From bottom position he looks to create back exposure through arm drags or harrasing his opponents legs from open guard however we have to understand that most of the time he doesnt actually get his opponent back from bottom position but he uses it to create dilemas where he feeds off his opponents defensive reactions to go to either sweeps or leg attacks most of the time. From cross ashi he can convert that into a sweep or a backtake like I discussed previously (provided his opponents build up to an elbow). Almost always when he gets into leg entanglements he tries to finish from there. His sweeping game primarily constitutes of the butterfly sweep (sumi gaeshi). A thing he uses that I ought to mention is that he constantly looks to cause kuzushi or off balancing to create opportunities for the previously mentioned attacks to work.

I hope you found my analysis helpful, I could talk about more things if you want me to but my comment is already too long.

edit: rereading it I think something important that I forgot to mention is hip heists to snapdowns from open guard. He uses that a lot to either get a front headlock, which isn't the case most of the time or to force his opponent to engage him, which is the case most of the time. This has become a crucial part of his game because a lot of ppl try to stall him out."

I think its more reliant on physical attributes than lets say half guard or butterfly guard (Kuzushi is also much harder). Hell, I cant even close it against fat guys!

I have a personal bias towards favouring lower body attacks over upper body attacks due to my body type and style. I like inside position/inversion based and wrestling reversals. To attack legs from closed guard is possible (inversion too) but not as easy as butterfly or half. Wrestling reversals are pretty much out of the picture. You also risk having your legs attacked much more so too.

It doesnt scale that well as friction decreases and sleeperiness increases, punches also completely switch the dynamic of the position, you go from purely offensive to primarily defensive.

Sweeps from closed guard are more rare than other guards.

Its not a position you HAVE to know and use. You can go by your jiu jitsu career and not do much if any closed guard. This cant be said for open guard.

Gordon wins weight and absolute in both 100% of the time so he is the most value for his money. So every other choice is solely based on wieght division since he wins the absolute in both events and we only care about gold.

The 4$ options are pretty decent but I think that they are not much better than the cheaper alternatives, at least not that much in a way to justify the price. I think the 77 division is the most stacked, a lot of good options for not that much of a chance to win due to the amount of competition.

I think Craig jones is a pretty good pick for 3$ so im getting him too. Nicky rod is a bargain for 2$ since I get a coach im assuming that there will be a camp and this guy got good fast, so hell probably get even better. Ryan hall and Khabib are pretty good deals for 1$ and a 2$ Miyao gets us up to 14. Add a Dillon Danis to anger/annoy/motivate everyone at the camp and I think We've got a good plan.

Im actually really interested in what danaher will release, where did you learn he will do so?"

bjj,fn81oc6,t3_fzrlao,1586732044.0,"Danaher, Gordon Ryan, Neil melanson. I think Danaher is a must and I really like how Gordon explains stuff, compared to Danaher. If im being honest I think Danaher knows more about grappling than pretty much everyone else combined. Neil melanson  would be someone I would be very interested to see in action. Havent fully decided on the last 2. Would love to see how Danaher would react to completely unorthodox stuff."

bjj,fmp04rq,t1_fmozzdw,1586271862.0,Yup its very good. Its out of Danahers front headlock DVD.
bjj,fmozjpy,t1_fmndo60,1586271555.0,"Yes there is! Snap the opponent down into a front headlock with witchever way you want. Assuming your opponent is in butterfly and you have a front headlock with your right arm, place the fist of your right arm right from his right hip and begin taking short steps around him until you go behind him."

bjj,fm41p7s,t3_fsmj9b,1585744183.0, Aside from the advice on conditioning I think you will get more results if you focus on the efficiency of your technique. Proper directionality of force and using the right muscle groups (Trying to pull your elbows back to the body using your back rather than curling with your biceps in certain moves) will also help your endurance
bjj,flujllc,t1_fleer6q,1585503909.0, Begin with John Danahers free DVD on solo movement. He covers basic movements in a truly impressive amount of detail. His dvds are the best imho but they are a bit pricy.
guardplayers,fluhufn,t3_fcs0ze,1585502899.0,"Anything inversion/inside control based. Wrestling reversals will work better for your body type too.

Half guard and  butterfly for kneeling opponents.

For standing opponents when you are seated try to pommel shin to shin and get into a leg entanglement (Ashi Garami aka Single Leg X guard, X guard, reverse X guard). If they have inside position and you are seated I would suggest trying to work for a single leg.

If they have inside position and you are supine I would suggest either trying to pummel back to inside position back into leg entanglements. If that is not possible then you pretty much have to play reverse De la riva or Outside de la riva. From there you can invert go seated again for a takedown or pommel into double inside position and work for a leg entanglement. Being shorter myself I find RDLR more comfortable than outside de la riva and I believe you will prefer it too. Inverting from outside de la riva is difficult against tall opponents.

Edit: My answer is no-gi specific. Those positions will still work in the gi (maybe not as well as no-gi because I suggested a leglock heavy game) but there may be other gi-exclusive options out there."
bjj,fl49e3c,t3_fm5syu,1584808770.0,"Well he may actually have tapped him while resisting. Ive had a similar experience from Danaher dvds tapping much higher belts. Unless you consider them exploding left and right struggling to breath ""playing around""."
