ptsd,fkjp047,t3_fiu3v7,1584253458.0,"This is so weird. I actually stopped by to talk about this and I haven’t checked Reddit in months. I feel more normal. I don’t feel good. This is all awful,  but emotionally I’m calming because this level of fear and chaos and panic coming from everyone else makes me feel like a normal person again. So very strange"
ptsd,f87elwx,t1_f87e93y,1574329423.0,"Thank you so much for the reply. I appreciate your support. I will probably go back to therapy after a short break, with a new therapist. The one I was seeing wasn’t trained in trauma or ptsd. Spending time outside and walking lifts my mood more than anything. Your advice is perfect"
ptsd,eynsomk,t3_cxhu5q,1567261003.0,I don’t get the love for this book. I spent a lot of time having to skip over stories about people having emotional flashbacks to when their parents gave them a mean look or yelled at them.
ptsd,eynscpf,t3_cxs3vs,1567260749.0,Scam
trashpandas,eyjyfnb,t3_cxaegv,1567131663.0,Loved this. Thank you!
pokemongobrag,exrzphq,t3_cu7krm,1566528225.0,I’ve never seen a shiny Tailow before.
pokemongobrag,exdix4n,t1_exdidh4,1566177898.0,Oh yeah. Good point.
ptsd,exdh09f,t3_cs9bb1,1566176422.0,This may be too complicated to answer but what did you do to get better?
pokemongobrag,exdgvdx,t3_cs9op6,1566176320.0,Shiny Jolteons look really cool
pokemongo,ew5j4uf,t3_cmydzv,1565137525.0,No one around here does a 4 hour courtesy or even a 10 minute courtesy.

ptsd,etqjmej,t3_cczr1n,1563087938.0,Please help her now. She’s serious
ptsd,etqjbfi,t3_cczr1n,1563087539.0,Someone please help
pokemongo,etlask7,t3_cc8tno,1562929912.0,I got one from a sentret about 2 days ago
pokemongo,et4nf32,t3_c9zppo,1562453474.0,?? A lucky can’t be traded because you can only trade a Pokémon once. The way a Pokémon becomes lucky is through a trade.
pokemongo,es6eb54,t3_c66f77,1561647329.0,So cute
ptsd,erzh4vc,t3_c51lia,1561435725.0,Audiobooks help me. Public libraries have an app called Libby. If you have a library card you can check out free audiobooks on your phone. I pick the books by the voice reading the book and not the content usually.
pokemongo,erqtn8d,t3_c3fpkv,1561151770.0,Pokémon Go is really amazing. I’ve been using it help treat PTSD. It forces me to go to new places and interact with other people. Really don’t know where I’d be without it. Congratulations on winning the raid. Wishing you healing. Keep playing. I’m not being dramatic when I say it’s saved my life.
pokemon,epwdbmc,t3_bw9ngc,1559572923.0,This is beautiful
pokemongo,epohc62,t3_bve406,1559344423.0,"Yes because I want to deactivate Facebook and my gmail is connected to an old account I’ve been trying to delete (please get back to me Niantic), so I set up a Pokémon Trainer account. I’ve found out that Pokémon Trainer is worthless  for logging in. I’d be more surprised if you were able to login with it"
EatCheapAndHealthy,epcfo0j,t3_buhk1g,1559153714.0,This sounds amazing. Thank you. Mangos are full of good vitamins
