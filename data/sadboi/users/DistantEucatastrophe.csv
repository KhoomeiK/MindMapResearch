depression,eocti58,t1_eoapw2x,1558463665.0,"My experiences: 

In Australia, usually the police show up / ambulance arrive. They allow you to go willingly into the ambulance. You get checked in as a voluntary patient in a psyche ward and they take really good care of you. You’re monitored and medicated. You’re generally allowed to leave after 24 hours. You’re not allowed a mobile phone and you’re not really allowed to interact with people outside of your immediate circle. This is to ensure all stressors are minimised. When it’s voluntary it’s peaceful and the professionals who are trained to help take a big weight off your shoulders. 

In another example: 

My neighbour tried to kill herself. I had been concerned about her for a while. I called the police to do a welfare check. They asked if she had any weapons and I said no. An ambulance came and so did the police. She allowed them to enter the apartment. They determined she was a risk (in Australia it’s called CAT team - Crisis Assessment Team). They restrained her and took her out on a gurney (with leather straps on her wrists). It was humiliating and made the problem worse. They then took her to a psyche ward for a few days. I felt really bad, but at least she is still here."
