This is a computer that records all of the flight data/radio transmissions etc stored inside a almost indestructible case. In the event of a plane crash the black box normally survives and if investigators can find it they can analyse the flight data to work out what caused the crash etc.

AmItheAsshole,fqh7sb0,t1_fqgqo1o,1589370439.0,"Been there done that! All the people telling you just to stand up to your mum have obviously never lived with a narcissist. It is very hard to escape or feel strong enough to. So...

Step one - open a PO Box

Step two - create a new email account your mum doesn’t know

Step three - depending on how crazy your mum is and if she monitors your phone then buy a very cheap burner phone and get a pay as you go SIM (all paid in cash)

Step four - apply for a new bank account. Give them your PO Box as the address, your new email as the contact email, your new mobile as the contact number but keep the phone on silent or turned off.

Step five - create a false back to a drawer and hide your new bank card and burner phone there or leave them with a trusted friend

Step six - start slowly siphoning money to your new account by cash if possible (harder to trace). So take cash out of your main account and then pay it into your new account. If your mum asks why you’re taking cash out of your account tell her your hours have been cut or you’ve got an unexpected bill etc. Any money you were putting into savings put into this new account.

Step seven - if you’ve got belongings you’re worried about look into renting a small storage locker or ask a trusted friend. Build up a stockpile of clean clothes and essentials. Make sure you’ve got important paperwork like your birth certificate, passport, driving license etc

Step eight - when you have enough to move out transfer the rest of your money in one go, make sure you’ve got all your important paperwork and leg it


The other option is a lot easier physically, but also a lot harder emotionally. Just pack a bag with your essentials, any keepsakes you don’t want to lose, and any important paperwork. Transfer all your money to a new account and leave. Ask friends/family to crash on their sofa, go to a shelter, sleep in your car etc until you find a place of your own.  It is hard but once you’re free it feels amazing. Good luck."

ThatLookedExpensive,fq9b806,t1_fq7gtwu,1589192267.0,"Hard to tell from this clip but it appears to me that the blue ship was overtaking the cameraman’s ship. In that case the cameraman’s ship was the stand on vessel and should have maintained course and speed. The blue ship was the give way vessel and responsible for a safe overtake manoeuvre so they would be at fault.

In another comment though someone else said they think this was actually part of a lightering manoeuvre which is when a heavily laden cargo ship transfers some of its cargo to another ship so they can enter a port safely (weight/size restrictions etc). This means the two ships were trying to come together but something went wrong. In that case the Mooring Master would probably be at fault as they’re responsible for overseeing the manoeuvre.

Whatcouldgowrong,fq94rti,t1_fq8tive,1589185527.0,"Basically. Every ship should be registered and insured. You normally have to notify the governing body where the ship is registered or the country who’s waters you are in. So in the UK you have to notify the Marine Accident Investigation Branch. In the UK it is the responsibility of the captain/skipper of the boat at fault to notify the MAIB as soon as possible although it’s advised for both parties to contact them. I’m not 100% certain who you notify if the accident occurs in international waters, I believe each ship reports to their registered jurisdiction but I may be wrong.

An investigation is then carried out. If it was an accident insurance pays out. If there’s a possibility that the collision was due to negligence or intentional then the captain/owner of the ship may face fines or criminal charges."
Whatcouldgowrong,fq7slmj,t1_fq7rn6l,1589151360.0,Hard to tell from the clip but it appears that the blue ship was overtaking the cameraman’s ship. In that case the cameraman’s ship is the stand on vessel and should maintain course and speed. The blue ship is the give way ship and is responsible for performing the overtaking manoeuvre safely. It appears that after the bow of the blue ship cleared they overcompensated and kept steering to starboard which caused their stern to swing round and clip the cameraman’s ship.
Whatcouldgowrong,fq7scbj,t1_fq7ryi7,1589151211.0,"Hard to tell from the clip but it looks like the blue boat was overtaking the cameraman’s boat and didn’t leave enough room.

If it was an overtake then the cameraman’s ship was the stand on vessel and should have maintained course and speed as the blue ship is responsible for the manoeuvre. No way the cameraman’s ship could have manoeuvred that quickly either way, these ships are not built for fast sharp turns."
Whatcouldgowrong,fq7q0j8,t1_fq7pqy0,1589149877.0,Basically! Again very hard to tell from the clip but I think the blue ship over compensated. After they initially passed if they’d kept going straight the anchors wouldn’t have swung round and hit them. But because they were still steering to starboard the rear swung round too far. Like when you see big trucks take out the car next to them at junctions.
Whatcouldgowrong,fq7pm14,t1_fq7ozor,1589149645.0,Nope. These ships are massive and very hard to manoeuvre quickly unless you have a lot of momentum and power. Looking at the video it appears the cameraman’s ship is not moving/barely moving so it would take time to get the engines online and move out of the way. If the ship had been moving with some momentum it’s possible. The collision should have been avoided a lot earlier. It’s very hard to tell from the clip who had right of way though.
Whatcouldgowrong,fq7p99a,t1_fq7oq0t,1589149453.0,"The ocean is full of currents which are like the roads of the sea. Ships want to stay in the currents as you can go a lot faster with a lot less fuel which means you save money. If you stay towards the centre of the current you go faster, if you drop out of the current you lose your momentum and have to burn a lot of fuel to get going again. Ships will try and stay in these currents as much as possible which restricts their movements to set paths rather then just sailing wherever they please. Their are strict rules on passing other ships but obviously something went wrong here!"

Whatcouldgowrong,fq7n9a5,t1_fq7mar5,1589148671.0,Centre of the current equals faster speed. No way to know for definite but it may have been a case of both ships trying to hog the centre lane so to speak.
Whatcouldgowrong,fq7lyr8,t1_fq7edfb,1589148162.0,"The whole sea has narrow lanes of high speed currents. Ships use these currents as you can go a lot faster with a lot less fuel. If you drift out of the current you lose a lot of momentum/time which equates to losing money and customers. That’s why you see so many ships taking the same routes. Some of these currents are very narrow and ships are desperate to stay in them to not lose momentum. There’s very strict laws on passing/overtaking other ships so every can stay in the currents safely.

If you’ve seen Finding Nemo it’s like when they take the EAC. Whilst in the current they move really fast. When they drop out the rest of the turtles shoot off into the distance whilst they stay still."
Whatcouldgowrong,fq7l8xr,t1_fq7f1vy,1589147885.0,Ships take advantage of the ocean currents as it saves you a ton of fuel. That’s why you see so many ships taking the same routes. There’s very strict laws on passing/overtaking in shipping lanes because of how little room there actually is to manoeuvre. If you drift out of the current it takes a lot more fuel to get your momentum back.
tumblr,fq3tpcz,t1_fq3r5h9,1589070146.0,"I once ordered a DVD box set in English on eBay. The next day the same box set but in Dutch was delivered to my door by Amazon. It had a gift receipt in with the senders details as some random letters, I think mmeot. My eBay account was still marked as ‘being processed’. I freaked out slightly wondering how someone knew that I’d ordered that box set, why they’d sent it, how they’d got my address etc. Amazon told me if it was a gift just to keep it as they’re not allowed to give out the senders details. 

Four days later my eBay order was marked dispatched. When it didn’t arrive I emailed the company. Turns out they were listing items on eBay with a postage cost, then buying the items for the same price from Amazon Prime and pocketing the postage. The senders details on the Amazon gift receipt stood for (company name) eBay online trade-in.  First enigma solved.

However I then pointed out they’d sent me a Dutch copy when I’d ordered English. They tried to claim I had to return the parcel to Amazon and attempted to deny my eBay claim. Had to argue with them over whether I had to claim the return through eBay or Amazon.  In the end I got a refund through eBay and Amazon told me to keep the DVD as it was a ‘gift’.  I then discovered that the box set had the English version on it. Win win lol."
entitledparents,fq10h68,t1_fq0zkqf,1589040085.0,The average temperature range for the UK in summer is 18-25c. So when a heat wave (by UK standards) comes we’re not prepared for it.  Almost no homes over here have AC as we normally have no need for them. Plus people are so unused to the heat that they just go out and sunbathe without thinking about things like sunblock or staying hydrated. So yeah 30c in the UK causes us huge problems with sunburn and heat stroke etc just because it’s not what we’re used to/prepared for.

Fun side story though. I’ve been training birds of prey for over a decade now. When working with birds of prey you wear the leather glove on your hand. My main glove ends just below my elbow and sometimes birds will miss slightly and land on your arm. Normally not a problem as they don’t grip but I had a peregrine falcon scratch me straight after killing a rabbit and the wound got infected. When I went to the GP my medical history comes up with ‘history of self harm’ (even though it’s been over a decade smh) and I had to spend 10 minutes showing him pictures of me holding different birds to convince him it was genuinely a falcon that had cut me and not myself!"

I have a small stuffed rabbit, very originally called Bunny, that my mum got for me the day I was born. My mum passed away when I was 19 (33 now) and Bunny comes pretty much everywhere with me. I don’t take him out day to day but he came to my uni dorm room, he’s been on holiday etc. I’m not religious, I do think my mum is gone, but I sometimes talk to Bunny as if it were my mum, I tell him about my day, how I’m feeling etc. If I’m particularly stressed then Bunny sleeps in the bed with me and then when I’m calmed down he goes back to his shelf. It just helps me feel grounded and closer to mum and helps me vocalise my feelings sometimes.

I’m wondering if your girlfriend could be doing similar, seeing this doll as a link to her grandmother and talking to it for advice/guidance? I do agree from your point of view it’s creepy, particularly given that this is a much larger, human shaped doll. Mines only a 15cm stuffed rabbit and if it made a partner uncomfortable he would stay on his shelf.

Officials refused to renew their license after multiple complaints they were selling unsafe cars. In September 2016 the Massachusetts Attorney Generals Office was granted an injunction to force them to stop selling unsafe cars and the company owner was facing a lot of lawsuits at the time the company closed.

AmItheAsshole,fn73tyr,t1_fn7368g,1586712759.0,I’d say OP is a jackass for how they handled it. I wouldn’t say knowing the science would allow you to throw a fit though. I’d have taken the friend aside and gently explained why it’s not advised and then let them make their own decisions. I don’t think the friend did it out of any maliciousness and was just trying to be eco friendly so embarrassing them in front of all their other friends and storming out was not a mature thing to do.
AmItheAsshole,fn71rge,t1_fn6cwsb,1586711612.0,"Actually it’s strongly advised not to use gray water for any plants that you eat the fruits of and definitely not root vegetables. Bath water contains human skin cells and faecal matter that can contaminate the plants and cause disease in humans. Animal based fertilisers are much safer as they are normally treated to remove unsafe pathogens.  Also in general animal diseases are a lot harder to pass to humans. Gray water is brilliant for gardens and very eco friendly but it’s advised not to use it for any plant you’re going to eat. Treated human waste can be used if monitored for pathogen levels but that’s normally done through major waste disposal plants.

So it kind of depends to me. If the water was just poured on the ground around say tomato plants that’s fine. If it’s poured onto root vegetables I wouldn’t be comfortable eating them. OP did not handle it well though and came across as a complete brat. Would have been better to gently explain to their friend why this isn’t a great practice as it sounds like the friend was just trying to be eco friendly.

LifeProTips,fn5w7pa,t1_fn4xg72,1586678072.0,"When I was a teenager in the late 90’s we were encouraged by our teachers and parents to use the same password for multiple sites so that ‘you don’t forget it’. No education on security or hackers etc. Looking back my parents computer must have been so full of shit with all the files my friends and I downloaded and shared without thinking. It wasn’t until I got to college that a teacher first told us about basic security and I changed all of my passwords to be unique and started learning about virus scans and firewalls etc.

My little sister is 10 years younger then me and when she went through school they had whole classes on password security, avoiding scams and hackers etc. I hope this is still taught these days!"

It just means they’ll have to pay more money later. If you can afford to then keep paying as normal otherwise you’ll just get a double bill next month.
