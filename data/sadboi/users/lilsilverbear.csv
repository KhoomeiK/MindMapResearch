relationship_advice,fh84hmr,t3_f1r8fn,1581351838.0,"One thing I've seen in the comments a couple of times is asking why I feel this way.

Communication starts getting better once we understand why we are hurt, angry, sad etc.

When I was 17 my mom told me something that literally changes my view of a lot. 

People get angry because they are hurt. Someone pulls out in front of you in traffic? Most people yell at them. Because that person was inattentive or uncaring enough to put your life in danger or your ability to pay bills due to a damaged vehicle or loss of vehicle.

So stopping the arguement and both of you exploring your feelings that led to your reactions and sharing them using 'when you (do/say) I feel (whatever you feel)'. Using 'you always / you never' is accusatory and judgemental.

I'm glad you've realised you have been toxic and it's amazing that you have done so and are willing to change to be a better person for him. I wish you the best in this very tough journey and do reccomend professional help as well.
