Anxiety,fn8k87s,t1_fn8ij5u,1586743537.0,"I'm not sure if you feel the same way, but my chest has felt so tight the past week. I know its from a constant anxiety, but that anxiety makes me believe its something more sinister. I haven't left the house in two weeks and I still think I could have caught it. Even though my symptoms are all anxiety symptoms, my dumb dumb brain attributes them to the virus. 

I had the same happen to me last week, I was super stressed for a day and it caused my temp to spike to 99.4, which gave me a panic attack. The next day I wasn't as stressed and my temp was totally normal. We're living in some freaky times, if you want anyone to talk to, just lmk!"

It's felt like the more I've googled, the worse I feel. Stay strong, try putting your phone in a different room while you do another activity or something. Keep a tally of every day you don't google your symptoms to track your progress in breaking such an obsessive behavior. I'm in the thick of it with you, don't lose hope!"

I quit smoking last week to reduce my chances of getting very sick with this virus, so maybe that's what's amplifying my anxiety-- It will be well worth it though.
