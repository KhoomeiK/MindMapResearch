One night it resulted in them pinning me to the ground because I said I wanted to kill myself and then tried to run away. Several other police cars and a FIRETRUCK showed up. This whole debacle took place in front of my then housing complex...so yeah. Was a sight to see for all the neighbors and my boyfriend at the time. Fun fun fun. Anyway... I was researching about the damage of alcohol on the body and brain today and I took these screenshots...might encourage you to stick to this path of sobriety. I know it is very difficult and there is no one RIGHT way to go about it. I've run the gamut. Treatment. Meds. Therapy. Etc etc. What's right for someone else may not be right for you. Don't overwhelm yourself in early recovery. Reach out. Get support...that's probably the most important thing in this moment. You are doing amazing and you can get through this.

SuicideWatch,fnqfral,t3_g332vs,1587163729.0,I'm alone and it's not very fun. I was having a blast at first but now I'm just stuck with myself and my thoughts 24/7 and it's not pretty. Makes me realize how much I dislike myself and how much work I need to do. It's become unavoidable.
BPD,fniq6fr,t3_g1vpju,1586984411.0,"I told my past counselor about my mask and we had many sessions where we discussed the nature of it and its purpose and how everyone has their own mask. We also talked about how it is okay to have the mask...it's a protective thing and that's something you have relied on for many years to get you through situations. It's a matter of slowly taking it off when you FEEL SAFE. So if you and your counselor can build an environment in which you feel safe then maybe, just maybe you can start taking it off. Little by little. What I'm trying to say is that you choose when the mask comes on and off. You choose who gets to see the real you. If you decide she is trustworthy enough then that's what matters. But you have to give her the opportunity..."
BPD,fncqx7t,t1_fncpox2,1586844323.0,"It's awesome that you are so open to all the information you're receiving from people. Just focus on that desire to be committed to change. You are totally capable of overcoming this and finding your authentic and deeply loving self again. First, understand YOU and love YOU. That's the only way. An example...today I caught myself getting mad at someone because something they said made me feel invalidated. I explored the thought. I questioned it. Suddenly I felt like reality was dawning on me. Why am I doing this to myself? I lash out at others because I feel inadequate. At the end of the day I'm dictating how I let the world affect me because I'm filtering it through other people's perspectives ... I need to focus on my own perspective. On how I view myself. Just some thoughts. I don't want to overwhelm you, I only wish to help. If ever you need to talk don't hesitate to reach out."

stopdrinking,fn9bxy8,t1_fn8h1cs,1586766981.0,Thank you. I have honestly tried everything at this point and I don't believe there is a right way to go about it. Maybe I need to ease myself into it. Or maybe I need to white knuckle it for awhile until the part of me that is unconvinced of the benefits of sobriety can open her eyes finally and maybe even enjoy the view a bit. A part of me is still clinging on for dear life to alcohol. For now I'm trying to listen to that part of me because every other time I only tried to tame it or lord over it with my false sense of confidence. I never considered that it might be trying to say something. I thought it was just an inner demon to be quieted but now I see it as something wounded that needs more attention. Anyway sorry for rambling lol. Thank you for your kind and motivating words. So proud of you for getting so far!
BPD,fn9bd1o,t3_g0dlld,1586766327.0, I'm a passively suicidal gal myself ...
BPD,fn9arh5,t3_g0dbmn,1586765659.0,"I don't have a BPD diagnosis but I do relate heavily to it. I struggle with substance abuse and there were countless times that I was abusive towards my ex. I still struggle with it and I don't think there is an easy way to handle it. It is important to differentiate between shame and guilt. If we go around feeling ashamed...we will never change. Shame shackles us to a sense of being less than and this can even further the abusive behaviour. I know that the more I internally punished myself the more I acted out. The more blatant my rage became. Guilt can be a healthy emotion as it can actually instigate change. Guilt is knowing you have done something wrong and wanting to change which usually motivates the change. The key difference is that you don't hold a belief that you are inherently evil and incapable of changing. 

Self forgiveness is also a good coping mechanism. Understanding your own humanity and that we all have the capability to lash out and hold negative feelings towards others. Researching the shadow and shadow work helped clarify this fact for me. 

Finally I think researching how to responsibly apologize and accept responsibility could be an important route. There is support out there for people who have been abusive ...as paradoxical as that may sound. People who are abusive are hurting in their own way and the cycle will never stop until they seek the right help. Anger management, therapy, meditation, being honest about your behaviour without getting shamed...all these things pave the way for dealing with this heavy burden. I hope you can take something from this. You can unlearn this behaviour. Best of luck friend."

BPD,fdp8h8a,t1_fdp1ztl,1578622465.0,I didn't tell my counselor I wasn't abusive...the opposite. I told her ceaselessly how abusive I was and she still told me I wasn't. I maintained that I was abusive even after that point. I still question it. But at a certain point he was using that label as a way to keep me in line while he low key took advantage of me ...so yeah I dunno.
BPD,fdon003,t1_fdolofw,1578608457.0,Yes that was the same with me. I never wanted to hurt him ..it seemed the things he did and my reactions to them and his inability to sit and talk with me just created a shit storm of issues. Makes me wonder if it was specific to that relationship or if it wouldn't matter who I was with.
BPD,fdol3ll,t3_emfjj8,1578607326.0,Who said you were abusive? Or are you classifying yourself as abusive? I thought I was abusive in my last relationship because my ex convinced me I was and while I do believe I was unhealthy and behaved in unhealthy ways I told my last counselor everything I had done and she told me I had not been abusive. So I don't know...I just get worried when people slap that label on themselves without differentiating between UNHEALTHY and abusive behavior.
stopdrinking,fdnhizz,t1_fdmli36,1578585933.0,"You're right. It's definitely good to keep that in mind. It's interesting that you bring it up because the doc who prescribed it to me did not mention the risks of combining alcohol and prozac and he was totally aware of my drinking problem. Kind of negligent of him now that I think of it. Again, I'm so sorry about your loss. That's even worse that you tried to prevent it to no avail. Thanks for keeping people informed  ...it is very important and probably not good to just assume that everyone is aware of these things."
BreakUps,fdmg60g,t3_em237y,1578548796.0,"It is a bit uncanny how similiar your experience is to mine. I was going on almost two years of that vicious cycle 'i love you, but I can't have you' 'i love you but you're too fucked up' 'i love you but I want to be single forever' he'd go cold on me but then butter me up when he wanted sex and tell me sweet nothings. I believed him every time. I do think he loves me, in a sense. But it's a love that has diminished greatly. I take some of the blame for that. I apologized for my wrong doings and in spite of breaking up with me twice because of my ruinous behaviour he still kept me on a string. He would continue keeping me on a string if he could. And yet I'm practically the devil incarnate to him when he decides I'm not convenient in the moment. I sometimes believe that I deserve it but then I think that doesn't make sense...why should I continue to be at his disposal when I've been making efforts to change for the better. I'm not who I was... I'm doing my best to live my amends. I had to block him. I told him I hated him. I was boiling with rage at his blatant lies and deception.

I guess I assumed it was common knowledge -  I should have prefaced with the dangers of combining the two but I was thinking more along the lines of using meds as part of a multi faceted approach to alcohol abstinence. I'm just saying at a certain point I had to accept that I was self medicating to deal with my anxiety. And yes, I do have addiction issues aswell but since I have started taking meds my anxiety has been greatly reduced and that in turn has decreased my desire to drink. Of course, I've had to change other aspects of my life so I don't credit the meds alone but I certainly notice they have boosted whatever other lifestyle changes I've put into affect. And I truly tried literally every other thing in my power before I started taking meds but at the end of the day anxiety was winning. I'm talking full on mental breakdowns so yeah..."

It's always nice to feel empowered and to be able to villify the other person because that brings a sense of ..moral superiority? I don't know. It's hard to be the one who has acted with less restraint. The thing is - we all have a shadow. We all have darkness in our hearts. We have to learn to weave these parts (or integrate them) into our every day lives. If we turn away from the shadow it WILL find a way to manifest. I recommend the book 'Owning Your Own Shadow' or some literature on shadow work. It helped me a lot. Another thing to remember is that there is a difference between guilt and shame. Guilt drives change. Shame is the belief that you, as a person, are fundamentally bad. Remember that and use the guilt you may feel as a tool. Don't let it own you. Goodluck! ‚ù§Ô∏è"
