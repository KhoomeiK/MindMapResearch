My family (who is ""close"") invited one of my ex to a court date and a character witness (a bad one) like he didnt sexually assault me, among other things. I felt complete betrayal. I was in tears asking them how could they have him there. I was actively trying to kill myself for 3 years. I obviously am not very good at it. I was taking all kinds if pills and cutting my wrist clean open. So they took my daughter away and they were afriad I would win the court case for temporary custody of my daughter. Being that the only illegal thing I did was try to end my life. I made a deal with them and took my ass to rehab where I had a therapist anytime I felt I needed one. For what its worth, I'm going to share what I needed to learn. 
   I was molested at 8 and raped at 15, 21 and 26. By different people. I was so mad at the world and didn't know it. I was diagnosed with MDD and CPTSD, something that develops when you are young. My distortions are distorted to my fucking core. Rape is a permanent scar we have to carry. There are ways to make that burden a little easier to carry. I recommend getting a therapist to help you process what has happened. It will never take away the pain that happened. It's okay to hate that predator. Not at your own expense. I was hating him at my own expense. I was giving him so much power, he was still fucking winning. I felt completely powerless over him. I dont know how old you are but if you want him to pay for what he has done. Then take it to the police. At the very least, he will be exposed for what he is.. If there is one victim, there are probably 10 more. I didn't report anything so I understand how hard that decision is to make. After rehab I had to go to court for divorce, I had made all this progress and the day before court I regressed so hard u
Into my disorder that my therapist was triggered and was sent into her own episode of PTSD. Fuck that. I am done letting him win. He abused me and I am punishing myself for it. If you must suffer. Make him suffer too. Use your voice. They want to make you feel like this? Make them feel the complete dissonance that you are feeling. He will not do anything in front of people. Sit at the table and make it uncomfortable for everyone. Call him a rapist and ask him why you. Bet he stops showing up. Get some help. It really fits make a difference"

He has one financial obligation and he likes to call her a financial burden. He is the shittiest kind of man. My therapist was in the San Bernardino shooting and also suffers from PTSD, my first court date for our divorce I regressed so badly that she ended up going into her own regression. My last session before today was Wednesday last week, before my first court date on Thursday and I saw her today. I'll just be living in hell for a while but I'm optimistic that I have a whole lot more knowledge of our system than he does, even his lawyer is advising him not to go to trial with me. So there is a positive to all this. My therapist has helped me so much. I'm not going to lie and say it wasn't hard as hell, it was. A therapist can only help you to do all the work for yourself. Kudos for finding your voice. I'm 31, my incidents happened when I was 8, 15, 21 and 26... I found my voice for this like, last month. I feared the consequences for speaking about it. Ever since I began talking, it's been nothing but healing. Fuck the distortions... I am sorry this happened to you. Nobody should have that taken from them. Stay strong, love."
rape,f779obk,t3_dumsxd,1573448041.0,"I read this workbook about C-PTSD and it was a form on exposure therapy. It was very helpful. Once you identify the distortions, it becomes easier to fight them. Not everyone has that form but it had helped with the form I received after my husband raped me. It teaches different forms to get through it and you can go back over it and keep working at it. I have a few that helped me. 

Yoga, modified for PTSD.... It basically has you told uncomfortable poses for a while longer than you normally would. Yes, it's uncomfortable, but it makes you more aware of your body. plus your muscles relax after you're done. 

CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy) really helped me. DBT did as well. I am going to recommend you do this with a therapist because facing the trauma can be hard. I waited until now to finally grieve over what was taken from me. 

There is a light at the end of the tunnel. I am not even close because I still end up in episodes only not I know what's going on... so now I am in a weird place where I have to fight my distortions with my logic. I basically see my therapist and fight with myself. I am in the middle of a divorce and even the thought of seeing my husband puts me in episodes for long periods of time.

I hurt myself because of shit that was done to me. Look at it as if you turned most of you meal into a vegan meal. in very small proportions. It gives your body all the nutrients you need, giving you energy and most importantly it's guilt free. My boyfriend's parents are vegan... I've had some seriously yummy vegan dinners. You wouldn't know the difference. Not gonna lie, I love cheese so I can't be about the vegan life. I also recommend seeing a therapist maybe even a nutritionist. Think of every meal being the size of your fist. if you build every meal on that size, you will get results. Your body stores because it's not sure when it will get more. Most people have this problem or the exact opposite, where they cannot stop eating. Eating disorders come with depression. Every human on earth needs to food to live. You are no different.

Depriving your body all day or eating once will tell your body that it needs to store everything it can. Get veggies and fruits for snacks. This isn't a diet, it's a lifestyle change. Plan out your meals and keep the pyramid in mind. Don't stop at just the meals and what you can eat. have an alarm set to be up at 6... walk for an hour every morning. You will burn anxiety and energy which will help you feel hungry when you normally wouldn't want to eat. choose healthy alternatives. None of this is easy. I hurt my Achilles, I have been trying to get back into this routine with a brace that makes it hard to run on my toes. if you do all of this, you will sleep better at night.

Vent,f6coo8u,t3_dqp8jl,1572787365.0,"This is the 2nd post about this subject I read this week. Anonymity gives people the freedom to post whatever they want. Much like you here posting this. People with no faces shouldn't have the power to throw you off this much. We go hard on earth. 98% of the time I am on Reddit to be silly, I very rarely look for serious stuff to wrap my head around. I have my real life full of stuff I have to wrap my head around. 

You are, in fact, your problem. I am my problem. Your feelings are yours alone to own. Most therapist will tell you the same thing. If you have issues with something, change it. Otherwise you are just insane... doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results. Those are straight up, words of wisdom. 

You want a bunch of people to empathize with someone they don't know? That's just not how that works. I've seen Reddit collectively take the higher road and support someone that was on r/RoastMe. That's just one example. If you post something that invites other people to give you their faceless opinion, you will just get that.  You have the power to either move past it or dwell on a comment some guy posted then forgot 2 minutes after he posted the comment. 

You want to play on the internet then you will get exactly what the internet provides. I'm 31, I am assuming there is an age gap between myself and the OP because the big bad internet got to them. It's the internet... If you were my friend, and you came to me with the words you posted, I would be saying the same shit I am now. For every 5 positive comments you read you see a negative comment and focus on the one negative comment... why? Much like society, people have different personalities. You will never control others, You can control you though. So post whatever you want and harden your heart to the internet because nobody is going to change this."

It's so deep rooted that parts of me are defined because of it. Please get help. The hospital will have no choice but to contact police. Talk to them. I am 31 now and I am only just now trying to face everything I avoided for most of my life. I turned to any and everything I could to numb all of that. Get a therapist ASAP, you did nothing wrong. Love yourself, believe me when I say this is no way to live. It doesn't define you but it does change you... Change in the best ways you can. it's okay to reach out on reddit or any other forum you want. I know how hard this is to face but please don't turn away from it. You are on the top reddit page for me... other people went through this and that's the best form of support. Don't be embarrassed, he was wrong. Don't lash out on yourself... don't play the what if game. You survived, you instinct told you what to do to get out of the situation alive. keep your head and make the piece of shit pay. rest assured the people in prison will also help. Don't give him your power, that mother fucker now has to face you. He thinks he got away with it. Now he will see you in a court room and won't be able to do a thing to stop you from using your voice. You have every bit of power right now. He doesn't get to win."

Scar's words are supposed to almost sting. Scar has one song.... that song also fell short of the viciousness that is scar. lol even when he killed Mufasa... Remember how you felt when he died? I screamed in my heart every time. haha I used to cry every time I saw poor Simba hurt. They even fell short making him a hyper little kitten. Now I watch the cartoon and get mad at how disappointed I was during the live action. 

What's worse (you put Nala in danger... pun intended)? The crew all have amazing voices, tell me why the cartoon  showed up all these professional singer?"
