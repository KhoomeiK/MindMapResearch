SuicideWatch,fn81gw9,t1_fn7xd02,1586731926.0,Control to me is being able to make myself feel better. I can't do that any more. I failed all my classes because if I dont graduate I thought It would make me have more of a reason to kill myself.
SuicideWatch,ffo372y,t1_ffo273u,1580073608.0,"No. I honestly don't care if people believe me or not or if they take what I'm saying seriously. If it's not a true ""problem"" people tend to just drop it. It's the future, not present. So it doesn't matter."
SuicideWatch,ffo1lhr,t1_ffo0hqh,1580073216.0,"Because right now I don't want to live. I want get to 18 and end it. Alot of people say that too. They say they aren't going make it or they can't see themselves getting passed a certain age but they end up being ok. I don't want that to be me aswell. I see no enjoyment in being alive and hearing stories like that make me upset because I hate knowing I have a chance of being ""ok"" when I don't want to be. I want to be dead."

AskReddit,fcpb1gz,t3_eauhhu,1577856721.0,I struggle with depression. I feel like im not allowed to tell anyone my issues. I keep getting overwhelmed and I don't know how to cope with it. I sit there feeling like I'm going to loose my mind. I always want to kill myself because I hate the way I'm living and I have no future and nothing to look forward to. I have a plan set out on how I'm going to kill myself and i just need to wait until I'm old enough to by a gun and get away from everyone. I just wish I was able to do it already. I can't tell my therapist I'm suicidal because she will have to tell my parents. I'm struggling and I'm panicking because I feel so overwhelmed all the time.

Although I have flashbacks, a pounding heartbeat, and I dissociate Everytime I get reminded of it it still feels stupid and like im doing it for attention when others have it worse. I haven't even been diagnosed yet because of how I feel about my trauma."

Even if you think your life isn't that bad, which can be good at times because it can make you less unhappy knowing there is good, but you can get worse and I don't want that for you. You should try talking to someone about you problems and such so you can get better before it's really bad, not saying that it's definitely going to get worse. If your feeling bad hmu, I'm here for you."
