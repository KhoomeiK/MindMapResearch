As long as you're a decent person and offer to help the parents then you'll definitely be a great uncle. At the beginning it will be more about helping your sis/BIL but again, all new parents are different and babies are different so you'll just have to see.. Just make yourself available and let them know you're there.

It can be as simple as burping her, rocking her when she's crying. Looking after her while your sis goes and take some time for herself.

If it's a simple owning up to what you've done. No questions, no debate. Then that's not selfish. ""hey im sorry I was such an asshole in high school.

technicallythetruth,fp5lrhh,t1_fp46z8g,1588333730.0,Thank you for your reply. I like that arrangement. Just g9tbkenwondering about whether you havr to carry birth certificates around with you when travelling and what not if you have to prove that's your kid (I know it's not usually asked for when people all have the same surname)
technicallythetruth,fp5ljav,t1_fp490zj,1588333528.0,That's really cool. Thanks for taking the time to explain. Yeah I don't think kids would get phased by something like this. Theyre very accepting of everything.
nosleep,fp4713g,t1_fjfuab5,1588292960.0,That's exactly the feeling... I kept reading just to cry it out and now I'm reading the comments sniffling..
