Getting perspective is crucial. And difficult. And none of the other people in your life, who don't know what you are experiencing's, damn business. Don't let them talk you out of something that feel right for you, and is ultimately a good thing and YOUR thing. I'd recommend getting people to talk to who understand this. Like a therapist.

We're neighbors! I have a psychiatrist in P7, Dr. Fl체gel, and if you need one of those she is quite excellent. She also mentioned a bunch of self-help groups to me which you would probably also benefit from:

**Gesundheitstreff Mannheim**

**Zentral Institute f체r Seelische Gesundheit**

Aaaaaand I call BS on not getting anything out of therapy because you ""only"" have C1. I have perhaps B1-B2 and still really benefitted from an inpatient stay in the psych ward.

I would also say, with some experience, that it takes 3 months to get in with a psychotherapist, and you probably don't wanna wait that long. I would recommend making friends with an **app like BetterHelp, where you can talk to someone in English at weird hours**. If you look around on podcasts, they often have a free first few sessions code, so having it for a month isn't too much.
