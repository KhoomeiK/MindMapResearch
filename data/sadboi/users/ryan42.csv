When I try to create great and perfect art intentionally, and focus too much on perfection is when I get stuck and dislike the outcome"

psychedelicartwork,fmenj9r,t3_fumsli,1586009111.0,"One of the best art tips I ever heard was to lower your standards and just get started creating all the time. i try not to expect anything of myself, not care about what anyone else thinks. Sure there is a ton of work I've made I don't personally like that much. But the thing is many people let that fear of not being good enough or criticism or judgment keep them from starting at all"

changemyview,f0i4f7k,t3_d4s7rm,1568635880.0,"One of the weirdest things to me is:

alcohol culture is openly accepted and encouraged by many, almost anywhere. many companies have happy hours in the tech industry, encouraged to drink on the job. drink at an airport, a restaurant, with your kids around you, no one bats an eye.

marijuana use on the job or off the job? ha. maybe.  drug test failed u cant get a job. or get fired.

marijuana use is still taboo to do in public places, usually. (maybe so much anymore not in certain cities)

you can get CPS/kids taken away if you smoke marijuana around them.  its cringy/bad to do marijuana around kids too close because of the secondhand smoke, i get that.. but having it in sight but not giving them any, is equivalent to having beers around your kids"
