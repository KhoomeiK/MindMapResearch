""That's so pretty. Well done! Nice jump."" That's it.

Few years ago I was resentful of kids because it appeared thy got ""all the live and I didn't"". But I am all grown up now. So am not really jealous I just don't know what to do with kids who are not as frightened of everything as I was."

Thing is now I kind of understand why some kids cannot smile. Why I could not smile. I have never judged Zuko. But I judge myself so harsly. I don't speak so I don't spoil someone's joke. I don't want to spoil someone else's happiness. And I feel like I am the damper in everyone's party.

If you have therapy, like I go to therpay and stuff, then one of the basic things my therapist teaches me is ""protect yourself first"". Self care, boundaries. So no matter how much someone emotionally blackmails you, enforce your boundaries. This helps both them and you.

I face this issue with my parents. They don't know what boundaries are. And because of that I didn't know what boundaries were. Now, because of therapy, I know. I also know they have no idea what boundaries are or mental health is.

Does any of this give them the right to behave badly with me? No. Do they treat me like a doormat all the time. Yes. And while I was letting them or being reactive....our lives were awful. Now that I have started slowly enforcing my boundaries, boy did they react like crazy at first, things are changing.

Sorry your main question:
Its the amount of emotion an event creates that imprints on the mind. Whether its happy or traumatic has no relevenace I think. Its an event that creates so much emotion a person's brain gets overwhelmed.  Thats what I understand fromt he articles books and videos I have been  researching."

Meaning I would go straight to my room, climb into bed and fall asleep. This year a few months ago, my therapy suddenly had results. I started going to kitchen and cooking. And I ralised what i feel is anxietu and fear. Everytime a door opens I jump. I hear footsteps I freeze, I begin to cry, feels like mom will shout at me any minute. To go intot the kitchen while anyone was in the house was so extremely bad. I couldn't figure out how food cooks or when to add salt or spices.

But I baked a cake which didn't burn and did it while meditating every minute.

And I dunno I thought of a plan to ""retake my house."" Like go to those places which give me anxiety and complete specifix chores. It has really helped me.

I am also really sad. I feel like I lost out on life so much because Anxietu crippled me, to the point I never got out of bed.

I lost my relationship to anxiety and mental health disorders and spent most of my youth hiding in my room when I should have been out having adventures."

My mun did pull a feq bad stunts the few times people offered me a space tolive. Calling the police, yelling threatening to break my laptop. My laptop is the only thing in this world that is mine.

Actually another reason is before therapy started I qas convinced that my job was to go through life wothout making any noise or sound and bwing as invisible as possible so as to not give mum any trouble. *sigh*.

CPTSD,fnkccf2,t1_fnkaluh,1587021851.0,"Ok awesome. Thanks for sharing your ephiphany! I like it when my brain finally makes sense of something its like a lightbulbs of happiness going off in my brain.

I kind of learned this in therapy and assumed its something everyone else learns in therapy as well. Parents denying our reality, parents holding us rsponsible for their emotions, holding space for others, listening without projecting, listening to learn, not to criticose and oh my god so so many. My therapist releases all these gems in slow doses, when he judges I am ready.

And I do agree with him  that if he had dumped everything on me at once withing the first few sessions, I wouldn't have known how to handle it.

Initially when I observed this phenomenon in myself, I couldn't hold space for anyone. And I was frustrated with myself, I judged myself and I hated myself for not doing the ""right thing."" 

My therapist kept saying ""be patient. Do your exercises. It will happen."" And it did. Just putting it out there for anyone who senses this in themselves and doesn't understand why they can't turn it off instantly. 

To anyone who is trying to do this, I cried so many times when I relapsed and gave in to old behaviour. Unlearning is a process, be gentle with yourself and don't give up. It will happen.

Sometimes I can stay calm, other times I need space."

MomForAMinute,fngivic,t3_g1mphx,1586933646.0,"It's going to work sweetheart. It's going to take a combination of therapy, disciplined behavioural change meditation, self care, understanding transactional analysis, and loads and loads of reading and podcasts. It's going to work because you are going to daily put in the energy and the effort needed for behavioir change. It's going to work because you will listen to your therapist and supplement your learning from reading about trauma therapy in books, websites, blogs even on reddit. (Mostly on instagram) It's going to work.  Don't give up if it doesn't work right now. There is no instant fix. You will falter, relapse, give up, feel like nothing works, but through it all you will persist. And it will work. How do I know this? Because I did this. As described above. Do not give up on yourself. People can support you on your journey, but you will be the one sitting down daily, journalling, meditating, exercising, eating healthy, firmly but gently and without judgemnet, teaching your brain to be positive, to respond better, to communicate healthily and with kindness. And when you make it, you will be so proud of yourself. Take care."

DecidingToBeBetter,fng9paq,t3_g1l4pd,1586925875.0,"Hi there, I would start with simple steps of self care and doing a simple self love meditation every morning. Just search on youtube, many available. Most of these will take about 30 days to change the mindset...so even when you feel nothing, keep doing it! 

Oh and its ok to listen to a different meditation each morning."
