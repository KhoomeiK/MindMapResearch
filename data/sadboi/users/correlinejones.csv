Damnthatsinteresting,fhu36b4,t3_f4ppnz,1581881384.0,That's cool.  I had to read it a few times to understand exactly what it ment.
BPD,fhu1jlp,t3_f4t73g,1581880744.0,I do that with songs alot.  I get obsessed with a band or song for a while and just wear the shit out of it. Then I get sick of it And have to wait A while before I can listen to it again. But if I limit myself I lose interest faster and that makes me depressed.

legaladvice,fcuzn5k,t1_fctn73r,1577991684.0,"I live in Cali. I'm only paid the minutes I work, so if I am on time and I wait for a kid to show and no one comes within 15 minutes, I'm sent home. Only paid for 15 minutes. Not 2 hours. The schedule is never written down, I had to make my supervisor keep it on her computer, but it's not printed.  Sometimes I get called in for 3 hours, I get there and there is no work, then I'm sent home, and not paid in full. And I cant prove my hours because they take my punch card and shred them.  So there is no record I worked other than my pay stubs.  Which don't show how many hours I'm scheduled, only hours I work.  Which is less than I'm scheduled."
legaladvice,fcupv2e,t3_eiv2yv,1577986099.0,"I'm in Calif. My employer gives me 2 to three hours at a time, he has never written down a schedule so my hours change, sometimes I have to go in because they call me in, right now I am scheduled for 6 to 8 hours a week. Normally the first wednesday i work an extra 4 hours. So I don't work a full 8 hours a day, but they call me in sometimes and then send me home within 15 minutes and only pay me for 15 minutes. That's not even enough money for gas. Plus my kids have to go with me and I have disabilities  that I cant claim do to the rules here, so that's extra work to go to work with them and then go home. I'm told if I have nothing else to do to clean the office which they keep dirty until I get there so I have to clean it but sometimes I finish before they're done with their sessions, by the way they have special classes that these people go to and their kids come and I watch them while they go to the special sessions and classes, so sometimes I leave early because I'm not supposed to wait till I'm off I have to clock out when I'm done working. Even if ts been 30 min."
