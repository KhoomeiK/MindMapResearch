BeardTalk,fpvvtd4,t3_gfueoe,1588952741.0,To help with the strays I would get a boars hair brush and brush your beard daily. Also I would recommend getting a beard oil and use it every other day. Remember a few drops can go along way.

BeardTalk,f0l3hvi,t3_d1lbm9,1568697043.0,Lee your skin moisturized underneath your beard. Use just a couple of drops of beard oil every few days. This will help keep your skin healthy and will help prevent beard itch.

BeardTalk,f035sia,t1_f034pgf,1568345570.0,It wouldn’t hurt every couple of days as it get longer. The best thing is to make sure your skin is getting moisturized underneath your beard.
BeardTalk,f034jiy,t1_f034d6w,1568344606.0,Get a decent beard wash and after you shower and towel dry it put a few drops of beard oil in your hand and then rub it in your beard. Then try brushing it. Sounds like your beard has been a little neglected on the brushing. Go easy as you brush.

Anxiety,eyz12gt,t1_eyyd99m,1567607041.0,It’s hard to not feed the beast/demon specially if you are a logical person. This morning my girlfriend had to tell me to stop getting worked up about needing to leave early to get gas in my car. I didn’t even noticed I was getting worked up because it’s so natural.
Anxiety,eyy7am1,t3_czfniz,1567573962.0,Based on my experiences of past mistakes aka relationships.  She isn’t worth your time. If someone gives up on you because you aren’t getting the signal then she isn’t worth it. If someone likes likes you then then they won’t give up on chasing you.
Anxiety,eyy72mc,t3_czg702,1567573722.0,One thing at a time. You can start with your car. Go to one of the self service car washes and dump the garbage out of your car. Make a list of small easy tasks and work on them. When you finish the list create a new one. I will bet the second list will be smaller than the previous. Eventually you will be caught up and have smaller To-Do lists.
Anxiety,eyy6sd6,t3_czfya3,1567573417.0,That my friend is called catastrophizing. I have the same issue. It’s really hard to catch yourself when it starts.  Right now I’m working on trying to catch it by if I start to over think something I need to stop and say to myself “why I’m putting so much effort into this?”  It’s hard to not think about it because you are human and care.  You aren’t selfish if you let it go.
Anxiety,eyy6j2d,t3_czegwl,1567573145.0,I understand your feelings but not to that extreme. My mom raised us to not look like slobs and give others ideas we were poor.  Decades later it slowly evolved to constantly thinking what others think of me. You just have to remember they don’t control your life and F*ck their opinions. We can’t rewrite our pasts but we can make the best of our future.  It’s hard to keep your head above water but eventually you will be able to touch the ground again. I still have to stop myself from worrying about what others think. We are works in progress.
Anxiety,eyy68p4,t3_czc7gb,1567572846.0,I would recommend deleting those numbers that stress you out. My contacts was chucked filled of people from past jobs and relationships. It felt really good to purge them out of my phone. I did the same thing with Facebook friends as well. You don’t need the stress in your life so they don’t need to be in your phone or social media profile.

Anxiety,eyxnld5,t3_czbnuz,1567557879.0,Public speaking is hard and I’m 38. I always try to focus at the back of the room and look just above everyone’s heads. It gives the perception the you are looking at the crowd when you really aren’t. The side chatter is hard not noticed. Most likely they don’t want to be in class and aren’t making fun of you.
