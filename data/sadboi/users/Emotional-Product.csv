It is not a trend that‚Äôs exclusive for duolingo. I have noticed that true free resources are getting rarer and rarer even in fields like programming languages. The question is: how much can we blame duolingo for wanting to make profit? I assume they have quite ‚Äúhigh‚Äù monthly costs for the devs, servers, support team, marketing team etc. And they do provide good resources and a simple way to keep learning a language. However in my opinion duolingo has drifted from its original philosophy to provide free learning resources quite some time ago when its user base started growing and they realise they need to make money to stay sustainable. 

Anyway I don‚Äôt think ~90‚Ç¨/ year of duolingo plus are justified. I‚Äôve been using plus for quite some time now just for the ability to be able to do what I‚Äôve been able to do several years ago with duolingo. Duolingo simply doesn‚Äôt teach enough or provide enough value to demand such high prices - or is still too focused on gamifying the experience rather than profoundly  teaching a language.

I DO find it sad that truly free self teaching resources are slowly dying out and are replaced by freemium or straight up paid models."
