It is not a trend that’s exclusive for duolingo. I have noticed that true free resources are getting rarer and rarer even in fields like programming languages. The question is: how much can we blame duolingo for wanting to make profit? I assume they have quite “high” monthly costs for the devs, servers, support team, marketing team etc. And they do provide good resources and a simple way to keep learning a language. However in my opinion duolingo has drifted from its original philosophy to provide free learning resources quite some time ago when its user base started growing and they realise they need to make money to stay sustainable. 

Anyway I don’t think ~90€/ year of duolingo plus are justified. I’ve been using plus for quite some time now just for the ability to be able to do what I’ve been able to do several years ago with duolingo. Duolingo simply doesn’t teach enough or provide enough value to demand such high prices - or is still too focused on gamifying the experience rather than profoundly  teaching a language.

I DO find it sad that truly free self teaching resources are slowly dying out and are replaced by freemium or straight up paid models."

After I lived in Belgium for some time my French became quite good so I started picking up Spanish again. I don’t confuse it at all anymore (unless I have to switch between them or I’m very tired). So if you want to pick up another language from the same language family I can advise to wait until the first language is “settled” and you have a strong foundation. 


Apart from that I’m currently learning 3 languages side by side: French, Spanish and Dutch and I’m going well. I wouldn’t advise you though to pick up two new languages at the same time - I tried that with Russian and Chinese and that was a very stupid mistake."

EDAnonymous,fjjvi2k,t1_fjih903,1583413400.0,Maybe try to complain to your landlord today? I did it once and then he hung up a note saying people need to be quiet after 10 pm or else he’s gonna kick them out.

Try to keep yourself hydrated today. Throwing up might help you feel a bit better - depending on how hungover you are but it’s probably better to not induce it since you’re already dehydrated from the alcohol. 

Hugs to get through the day, you can do it!"
EDAnonymous,fjh561a,t3_fdc0p9,1583341444.0,I completely feel you - every time I eliminated junk food it worked for a few days until I full on relapsed. Have you tried maybe cutting one junk food out at a time? Maybe start with the one you like least?
