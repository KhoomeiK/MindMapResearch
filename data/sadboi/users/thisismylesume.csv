When it gets really bad there’s a specific one that really freaks me out. I didn’t name him, but I just kind of know him as “Henry.” When I’m trying to sleep but I’m feeling particularly anxious and paranoid, it’s like I can feel him leaning over my bed with his face directly over mine with his mouth open extremely wide. I know that it isn’t real but I still have to hide under my sheets bc it freaks me out and I can’t stop feeling his presence. It’s very concerning. I have not seen a doctor about it. It’s probably fine."
