And before I get the “Craigslist is full of scams!!!!” Save it. I have been using Craigslist to find my cleaners and it has been an extremely useful tool. Stop being lazy and start interviewing people to clean. Set a standard price, advertise on the ad that you will pay an “X” amount per cleaning. If you have a house, $55 (this price includes laundry) is a good price to start with.

DoesAnybodyElse,fc4hkza,t1_fc3qcv0,1577416874.0,"If you cared to read/research the book I mentioned you would realize that you what you are paraphrasing is not what I’m trying to say at all. Radical forgiveness is realizing there is a higher power at play, once you start living at the cause rather than the effect, your life begins to change. Dropping the victim mindset doesn’t mean you have to blame your self, simply realizing that there are other factors at play and there is a reality beyond the senses and everything truly does happen for a reason. Whatever hardship one goes through, the soul needs to go through it to progress to higher level consciousness. You can forgive from the level of realizing the soul needs to progress, and through love you can truly let go and not live a life based off the past. And for the record, I do have mental health issues/depression, just saying what is working for me."
DoesAnybodyElse,fc3nwqd,t3_efxivu,1577394235.0,"Meh. Done that before. Moved sooo many times in the past three years. Over 10 times. Was one of the most depressing time periods of my life. “Wherever you go, there you are” If you move with the expectation that all your problems will be solved with a change of environment, you may be extremely disappointed. If I could go back and tell myself something is would be this: Heal the problems going on in your mind first. Also understand that it is YOU that is the problem and is causing void in your own life, not others. Seek healing and forgiveness from within.” A book that truly helped me understand what it meant to “forgive” (forgiveness can sometimes be an abstract concept and is not properly understood) and “let go” was a book called Radical Forgiveness by Colin Tipping. Once I was able to radically forgive and drop the victim mindset, my life is just now beginning to open up to me. Being burdened by my past was a big reason why I was depressed and felt like I could never settle. The realization happened randomly when I was driving one day. It felt like my entire chest was cleared of stress and was released (apparently I was holding the stress in my chest). I highly recommend that book. 

Although moving to California was definitely one my better moving decisions lol no regrets there."

depression,fbhbo38,t1_fbgb84k,1576869861.0,"It’s never been a good relationship with any of them honestly. Always been that way. It was like growing up with a group of strangers, but even worse because they were abusive. So disconnected spiritually, I always felt like I was mistakenly placed. I would say my depression is rooted in my past, just feeling like I could never do anything right. I was bullied heavily and high school, never had any stable relationships. Never had good relationships with teachers, I was never told I was intelligent or anything. I don’t even see myself as a “bad person”. I’ve actually never stolen or screwed anyone over. I always tried to be nice and I just get walked all over. I never had a role model growing up, my parents failed in that regard too because of the abuse and my mother was not role model material at all. 
All of this has culminated in me being overly defensive and unable to maintain relationships, even if that person means the world to me. It’s like my emotions take over and I’m not in control. What ended my relationship with my boyfriend was that it got physical. I should have just controlled myself but it’s all my fault. I just have so much self hatred and abuse. I don’t  know where to start or how to improve myself or change. Since I do not even know a time in my life I was happy, so I do not have even that to draw upon to formulate a “new self”. I have always been a sad child, the first memories I have is me being upset and crying. No one likes dealing with me growing up because I cried so much. I cry now. Nothing has really changed. Just failures on multiple levels,"
depression,fbg839o,t1_fbg4prl,1576839245.0,"For me personally,  being financially secure doesn’t help my depression at all. At the end of the day, money is just money; it comes, and it goes.

Candida,f86dyg3,t1_f86666l,1574295823.0,"Lol your doctor won’t even entertain the possibility of candida, I’d be surprised if a conventional doctor even knew what that was. You’d have to go to a eastern medicine doctor if you actually want to get treated by a doctor. Or take a lab test like I did for $150-200. The pharmaceutical companies do a fantastic job not addressing candida at all."
Candida,f85l9oa,t1_f84rpo3,1574277662.0,"Yes my anus bled all the time from all the itching, and taking a pee was absolutely excruciating. Did your doc already check your anus for hemorrhoids? My doc thought it was hemorrhoids too, but when she checked my anus, stuck a few fingers up there , she said I didn’t have them but continued to say “well...it’s probably still hemorrhoids” huh??
IBS could be facilitated by Candida. Maybe in your case , the anal itching could be from candida and IBS , but getting rid of the candida could get rid of both issues.
 I took this micro biome test (sent in a stool sample) and just got my results back yesterday...my gut is fucked, I already knew that though lol I have a list of superfoods I should be eating and avoiding according to my micro biome and will be eating foods off that list. I’ll keep everyone updated here on my progress after 90 days or so, I have to completely change my diet, which is cool since I feel like shit all the time with lots of brain fog. The foods I should be avoiding according to their food list blew my mind bc foods like broccoli , tomatoes, and spinach were listed. Crazy bc I eat those foods often but I guess my body struggles to process those foods and enables the yeast to flourish. 
I used the cream only after I solved my candida problem in my anus, since the itch was mostly internal , then I started using the cream when I realized I had psoriasis on my anus from the itching. Otherwise , if you don’t tackle the root of the problem (the candida) using the cream will be pointless. 
I think the yeast in my anus may return unless I get rid of the yeast altogether in my gut which is how my anus became entrenched with yeast to begin with. However, it’s been over 2 months and it’s still ok. The yeast treatment worked almost immediately for me. 
Sorry for the long post lol I’m delaying packing my apartment right now"

childfree,f7oirzf,t3_dx32n1,1573928137.0,"Having a high IQ doesn't determine how ""intelligent"" someone is. Intelligence comes in different forms. I'd be damned if a single test conjured up by pretentious ass holes with PHD's determines whether I am ""intelligent"" or not. I'm not sure if I took an IQ test when I was younger (if I did, it was probably low), but I was constantly told I was ""slow"" and ""unintelligent""  specifically by a corrupt doctor and teachers. My parents actually believed them and were ashamed of me and frustrated. They never had my back and never defended me against these teachers and doctors. For years I couldn't fathom how a parent could allow someone to talk down about their child like that. However, eventually I realized they had very little back bone or ability to face confrontational situations (it's easier to follow the crowd instead of dealing with situations in alternative ways or saying ""NO""). Growing up, my father would constantly tell me I was stupid, be physically abusive, and had no talents, comparing me to my brothers. My mother was equally as abusive and always was on the side of the teachers and doctors who put me down. As a result, I grew up with zero confidence and had almost no friends. Up until recently, I would constantly flounder in life, never knowing what I would do; since after all, I was so stupid and worthless, who would hire me? 

Today, I run a successful hosting business and I am a artist. I  also cut my family off and no longer have any relationship with them. I cant say that I miss them at all or yearn to ever have a relationship with them. They don't seem to care all that much either, everyone is better off!
