I'm thinking of Chicago, Montréal, etc. The odd thing is, that rivalry looks pretty dumb when you put it on a teatowel, or write the one-trillionth column about it in the lifestyle section of *The Age* (which is 95% of it, these days), but it can be a powerful engine for differentiation. The arts and culture scene in Melbourne absolutely slaughters Sydney's, as it does with sport and food as well. The natural landscape and weather are both a bit shit so Melbourne had to develop indoor culture in a way Sydney never did. The reason I think the rivalry is so much more apparent in Melbourne, apart from the second city identity, is that Melbournians are *aware* of that difference, whereas most Sydneysiders don't know that it's missing.

I want to raise something that might be a little unsettling or upsetting to hear. I'm a Buddhist practitioner living with bipolar type 2 disorder. There are some aspects of your story that resonate with my own experience. It doesn't have to be high drama mania and depression — it can be more subtle ups and downs. This can make it really tricky to maintain a steady insight practice. I have found that when I'm really struggling, *metta* practice often works better for me than insight and concentration practices. If you think bipolar might be part of your picture, there are web-based quizzes that have been validated by researchers, e.g. the Black Dog self-test.

sydney,fq5nox0,t3_ggy4jk,1589112079.0,"It's not great, but then, the CDNA case definition indicates there are two main risk scenarios for Covid-19 transmission. Close contact is defined as 15 mins face-to-face with a confirmed or suspected case. Prolonged contact is 2 hours+ in a closed room with a confirmed or suspected case. This situation isn't great physical separation but I would be surprised if it met either definition.

People think the physical separation recommendation means that SARS-CoV-2 is airborne or at least transmissible via casual contact. That is very clearly not the case. I think by now we all know the main thing we're trying to avoid is community transmission, and the second main thing is clusters and superspreaders. The definition of community transmission isn't that intuitive. It's transmission where we can't identify the source patient. 

So we're trying to avoid **mass gatherings** where transmission between strangers can happen, and in some cases, superspreader events can occur. Mass gatherings can be intentional (like a wedding or funeral) or emergent (they just happen by accident). An example of an emergent mass gathering is this: everyone wakes up on a sunny Saturday morning and decides to work on DIY or garden projects, so they all cram into Bunnings. 

The physical separation recommendations - 1.5m for persons, and one person per 2x2m of floor space for retailers, venues, cafés etc - are primarily about **avoiding emergent mass gatherings.**

When it comes to your infection risk, the biggest risk is shaking hands or doing the hug-and-kiss greeting, or touching a surface that has been sprayed or smeared with droplets from an infected person, and then touching your face. So keep up the handwashing, avoid touching public surfaces, and avoid touching your face, and don't stress too much about casual contact or queues clumping up a bit."

And it's really important not to force anything. Yes, if there are no other sensations arising, you gently bring you attention back to an anchor — usually the rising and falling of the abdomen.

In my case it's often an old shoulder injury to start with. By noting the presence of discomfort, and noting my aversive response to it, I can focus on it, and slowly notice it is not one thing but multiple, composed of tightness, heat, and so on.
