Damn this game is amazing, and I really really hope we meet Tyr in the next game - he sounds like a standup guy. And I am so excited for more Thor and Odin wow yeah i’m excited."
XboxSeriesX,fop4mu3,t3_fkv0m2,1587952978.0,"Both consoles do a great job at what they do. Sony drives home the single-player, story-driven games and focuses and making sure their studios have the tools to make those amazing games. Microsoft has kick-ass specs for its multiplayer centered fans and deliver some awesome community-centered games using a lighting fast and powerful console. 

Specs DO NOT MATTER. All I hear from Microsoft fans is how buff their specs are but what hell are the specs for? They’re for the fucking games. The next generation of video games is always about the games, every time. 

I’m down for both honestly if it means that these two amazing companies get to push video games forward, right? I’m just here for the sick ride playing some mind-blowing games. Peace."
