Your original story came to me at a time in my life where i didnt care really if i lived or died.  I was drinking alcohol daily, getting completely wasted just to sleep.  When i read the story you shared about weaning him off alcohol... something about it gave me hope.  I saved a link to it so i could keep updated.  Then my phone had an update and the app i was using disappeared and i didnt find his story again until now.  

Im at a much better place now, and my drinking is far better controlled.  You are both truly an inspiration.  

So really, really thank you.  Thank you for giving him hope, and eventually me, too."

If you look at the report they put out (https://www.fda.gov/animal-veterinary/news-events/fda-investigation-potential-link-between-certain-diets-and-canine-dilated-cardiomyopathy), the LARGE part of dogs diagnosed with DCM were on exclusively kibble, over 450.  Taurine, the amino acid associated with a healthy pup heart, can be found naturally in raw meat.  Only 9 of the dogs reported with DCM were raw fed.  Adding a commercially-made and professionally balanced raw diet or even adding some into their current diet is a great way to protect their heart health.
