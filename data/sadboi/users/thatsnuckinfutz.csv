TalkTherapy,fqoavm1,t3_gjpy6n,1589511196.0,this is something I'm so thankful my T also believes. I think thats the only reason I'm still in a semi functional emotional state.
TalkTherapy,fqoajot,t3_gjsi50,1589510995.0,i had gotten to a point where I *really* wanted to say something and the weight of wanting to talk about it outweighed the fear of my T's reaction. I didn't know how to bring it up but my T is good at kind of poking further so I briefly danced around the topic 1 session and she asked further and I just said what happened. It wasn't as big of a deal (bringing it up) as I had thought it would be.

TalkTherapy,fqngq7n,t1_fqngdrx,1589494547.0,"definitely, it's not exactly abandoning..more of like throwing in the towel because I'm stuck in certain thinking patterns. I guess I mean their level of patience with me far supersedes what I have for myself and I've never had that before."
TalkTherapy,fqlakhy,t1_fqgh54f,1589452063.0,"i have been here too, ended up apologizing to my T for not cancelling beforehand. They were completely fine and understanding about it but it just sucked in that moment. As hard as it is don't be too hard on yourself for it, you have another appointment coming up and hopefully talking about this and what triggered you can help ease things for you.

edit to add: Wanted to add, I had originally felt like I had wasted my Ts time but I was told I didn't since they finally got to kind of ""see"" how I react when things get to be too much. So that's another perspective on it, I know I minimize things usually so in some ways I'm glad it happened during a session instead of in between appointments and I downplay it by the time I see my T again."
TalkTherapy,fqla1td,t3_gj3khq,1589451553.0,Learning to trust that my Ts (i have 2) are more patient with me than I am with myself. I'm used to getting frustrated and giving up when it comes to myself and by then I'm usually the only 1 in my corner anyway. So I'm learning (slowly) that they're willing to help me get through those moments and do things differently instead of just giving up on me.
TalkTherapy,fql9j18,t3_gj92y9,1589451027.0,"my therapist shares what id say is alot and its been mostly personal. sometimes it directly relates to a situation and other times it's indirect but its always been of benefit to me. my T knows that I'm not trusting of others so it's going to take a lot to get me to the point of opening up about deeper things. It has definitely worked, I've mentioned things in therapy that I used to say I'd take to my grave. As long as u aren't having to take care of your T or aren't uncomfortable by it."

As for the procedure, if the bill comes after its already done then theres really nothing they can do, assuming u are the one who is going to pay the balance. If u know their info u can see if there's a paperless bill option n just switch it over for the billing period of ur procedure. Otherwise maybe try gettin insurance on ur own but definitely look into their coverage on ur procedure before committing to that company."

ptsd,fqf2wty,t3_gikadw,1589317819.0,"in my case i notice that in those chaotic moments that my outside environment matches how I'm constantly feeling on the inside.

TalkTherapy,fqddt88,t3_ghf0dg,1589287397.0,"I havent fully accepted my experiences as trauma/abuse so idk how helpful I'm about to be. 

I minimize or try to rationalize the hell out of every single one of my experiences. My T calls me out on it constantly, which I'm thankful for. Part of the problem with my upbringing is that I wasn't in a setting where my needs were met properly so I learned to either brush everything off or find a reason my actions justified the reaction. Someone else can come to me with the same exact circumstances and I'd be livid, saying it's abusive etc. but when it comes to myself it just doesn't garner that same reaction or level of concern. In my therapy it's been brought up it *could* be a lack of self worth so maybe that's something may apply in your situation too."
TalkTherapy,fqdc05r,t1_fq9u7u0,1589286084.0,">Sometimes putting effort into your appearance can really help to keep you trucking along when you're struggling mentally/emotionally, and there are ways to get tattoos and nice clothes or go to concerts without spending tons of money. What he said is cringy because it shows a complete lack of understanding of the reality of financial difficulties, it's an outsider looking in and making a snap judgment.

You said so much here. I honestly think me having the luxury to put a decent outfit together and slap on some $7 press on nails while being on temp disability is literally what saved me from just giving up entirely. I was able to make my copays everytime thankfully but I remember a few times before getting food stamps that I had to choose between getting therapy or having enough to eat for the day and those were the days I wore my cutest outfits. 


Although I'm no longer on temp disability and am getting back on my feet quickly, I'll never forget how hard things were and I'm the first to tell people not to make quick judgements based off of someone's appearance. I'm so glad my therapist isn't like this and she understands how not everyone is milking the system or born with a silver spoon in their mouth.


Side note, I do think/hope given how many people are being affected by this pandemic and now getting on assistance this classist mentally will change. It's a whole nother thing when u never thought it would be you and now you're standing next to the very people you looked down on."
TalkTherapy,fqda9cb,t1_fq9fkg6,1589284698.0,"**thank you!** I was on temp disability for a year as well as still on food stamps. I have ""nice"" clothes because at 1 point I wasn't struggling financially. I'm young and look able bodied however I've been in weekly treatments due to injuries from a multiple-car accident for almost 2yrs. I would be devastated if my T assumed the outfit I have on is new and I'm just milking them so I can have more money to go shopping. I never understood the issue with people who need assistance getting it and this idea that u have to look like u haven't a home in order to not be judged."

As much as the length of anticipated time to ""heal"" concerns me, I look at it with 2 options: I can either attempt to do it on my own and hopefully do it the ""right"" way and get by. **OR** I can continue to seek help for however long it takes and live a much better productive life. Mind u, this is specific to me and my issues/behaviors. I know I need therapy and me doing it on my own is why things got to the point that they're at now and I'm not satisfied with that."
therapy,fq7uov8,t3_ggzkzf,1589152582.0,">Not just those of us with mental health issues of the sort, but people who've went through traumatic incidents or live events, or perhaps bereavement etc. (Anything you care to share) find that keeping s**t to yourself has helped in some form?

I have an extensive trauma history as well as GAD, cPTSD and probably depression too. I'm very emotionally disconnected (i rarely have much I truly feel and usually have no idea what I'm feeling when its anything besides being annoyed or angry). It served a protective purpose when I was in abusive situations and had to logically figure things out and keep my emotions at bay. The frequency of things being done this way was enough that I have no idea how to stop doing it and just allow myself to feel my feelings. 

It's now become a significant hindrance in my life. I'm in my 30s, I have tons of health issues, a substance addiction and frequent panic/anxiety attacks. I don't vent often outside of therapy (personal choice) and I seem to be the person most come to about their issues anyway. I don't see that changing but my mindset is if I can process my life experiences correctly the other day to day bullshit won't seem so overwhelming at times. Just my take on things."

Don't let the labels of ur episodes bring u down though! I get both anxiety and panic attacks and once I could put an official name to it it was kind of a relief.

TalkTherapy,fq38inh,t3_gf3rkf,1589063993.0,"Panic attacks suck, I had 6 last year and every single one I felt like I was losing it. Breathing exercises have worked wonders for me, they don't always stop them dead in their tracks but they're less intense and I'm able to just ride the physical aspects of it out. Also catching them early on is key for me. I, too hate expressing certain emotions (I'm very emotionally disconnected) but I'm learning we have to have them and just kinda let them do their thing so we can process stuff and move forward. Not expressing emotions had held me back significantly in my mental health. 

Also read TBKS at my Ts request, it gets triggering around chapter 7 or 8 I believe so if childhood abuse triggers u then just mentally prepare yourself. Aside from that it's a great book with alot of info, now that u are working on accepting you have experienced panic attacks it'll help make u aware of how other things show up in the body. I definitely learned alot. Best of luck to u, u are going in the right direction!"

I have left a few sessions very reflective but also kind of out of it. I definitely get therapy hangovers lol I just try to unwind in healthy ways. Sometimes its been get a smoothie, take a walk, get a pedi, other times I've literally just layed on the floor and stared at the ceiling until I snap out of it.

therapy,fq2qqk0,t3_ggfq8b,1589058728.0,"i think thats a realistic and honest thing for ur T to say. IMO anyone that has mental health concerns that surround stress management, anxiety, depression, and emotional regulation are dealing with things they will continue to need to work at for the rest of their lives. 

Think of it like someone who has an addiction (not saying u are addicted to anything) they will continuously work at not using whatever they are addicted to, for life. Or another example is maintaining a healthy diet/lifestyle. All of these things take a lifetime of constant effort...that's not to say that over time it won't become a positive habit thus making things easier. 

So ur T is accurate in that sense but look at it like 1 day it's not going to feel like ur *dealing* with it but rather something u have under control or better managed."
