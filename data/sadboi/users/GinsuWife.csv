BPD,foogmcn,t3_g8jvs5,1587938596.0,It's weird being a guy with BPD. I feel weird about it anyway. I didn't know much about it and when I found out what it was...I fought against it for a long time. I don't want this but I have it. So I have to figure it out. It's just hard being a guy cause I want to reach out and make a deep emotional connection. I'm just too much. I hate the stigma. Thank you OP for your perspective.
BPD,fgegqs9,t3_ey0302,1580699155.0,"You're not alone. I hit my bottom too. I never self harmed and now here I sit, a 34 year old man, with cuts up and down my big hairy forearm. Poppin pills, ignoring bills, yeah.....you're not alone. LIFE by HEALTH is my current theme song.  https://youtu.be/S9nsLXLFOpg

Keep an eye out for the beautiful moments and hold onto them. I promise they're in your future but I know there's a lot of pain in between them. You can do it though, I can too, we'll get there :)"
BPD,fgebp4c,t3_exyhqu,1580695911.0,"From personal experience, once you're in that consistently dark place where ""I don't want to be here"" is your mantra, it's time to go inpatient. I just had to do it after I kept making threats and my self harm escalated. I'm sorry you're in the middle of it right now. I know exactly how it feels, it literally hurts to breathe. I wish I could give you better advice, some way to ease it up a little but all I could do was curl up and sob. If ya wanna talk you can reply here or msg me. Not sure how much help I'd be but I'm here and I've been there."
BPD,fge8ql6,t1_fge6111,1580693925.0,"I wouldn't listen to what other people are saying. If you tell them you can only be around them if they seek help they will just give you the runaround. It'll be ""Yeah I'm researching to find a therapist"" or ""I'm making an appointment soon"" anything to reassure you for just long enough that you can go back to dealing with them and whatever issue is going on atm. Tell them what my friend told me. You know it isn't their fault but you are struggling yourself and need some space to work on yourself. You are not equipped to help them and their mental health is affecting you. Make it clear that you are ending it, effective immediately, to work on yourself. Then you can bring up the fact that they need to seek help and maybe in the future you could reconnect when both of you are in a better place. The possibility will either keep them from flipping their shit or they will and you'll know right away that you made the right choice and you're done.

Please keep in mind that I am not a healthy normal person telling you it's important that you end the friendship. I have BPD and my best and only friend in years just had to do it to me. Not only that, but I nursed a secret little daydream of being with her romantically in the corner of my heart. Well maybe not secret but we had discussed it after I admitted a crush early on in our friendship. We were just friends. If I'm not actually in love with her it's the closest I've ever come and probably ever will. And the last time I saw her, she initiated things and we fooled around. My stupid little fantasy actually happened. I went from the happiest I've ever been to immediate and total devastation while going to town on my arm with a kitchen knife. It's been months and I still break down. But I was not healthy for her and she had to go. It was a harsh reality but like they say, if you love someone..."
BPD,fge4s5g,t1_fge2nia,1580691366.0,"You can tell your mom you're depressed and want to get help without getting into the specifics. If you have no idea what BPD is and start googling you can end up equating it with being a sociopath or something. People are often not very kind when discussing it. You don't want your friends and family trying to figure it out on their own and getting the wrong idea. Talk to a professional, figure it out with them and then you'll be armed with a diagnosis and the knowledge to explain it to your friends and family."
BPD,fge4b00,t3_exy496,1580691059.0,"It's going to hurt them no matter what. That's not your fault though. Fear of abandonment is BPD. If they're the type to take shit badly and rant about people...well buckle up. All you can do is tell them as directly and calmly as possible.

My best friend ended our friendship recently. This is just one of the many texts because I was begging her not to leave. I knew I was just making it harder on both of us but I couldn't accept it. I think it's a decent example to emulate. My insecurity and inability to give her space was just too much on top of what she was going through. At this point she'd already told me she couldn't be friends and we'd returned each others shit like a breakup. In the process of doing that she said something casual and light hearted and I jumped at the opportunity to try and talk like we used to.

""I don't mean this in a rude way at all so please don't take it that way, but I still can't really maintain a friendship right now. Maybe in the future, and I don't hate you or anything, but I texted you the other day just to apologize for how I went about things and to let you know about your stuff. I'm really sorry.""

Like a week later I tried again. Yeah, embarrassing.

""I'm really glad you're feeling better, but please stop texting me. I don't know how else to say it, I feel awful, but part of not being friends means not texting me every other day. I feel so shitty sending this text. But I can't stay in contact with you rn.""

As you can see, trying to shake us is beyond frustrating. I don't get pissed and yell and insult though. I get very hurt and throw pity parties and threaten to kill myself. I still want to talk to her. Every fucking day I have to stop myself, if I can. So all you can do is be direct, consistent and calm. How they take it is beyond your control so don't burden yourself with it. Good luck."
BPD,fge050e,t3_exxuq7,1580688903.0,I'm assuming you already went through the 9 part criteria and have 5 or more? You need to discuss it with a therapist or psychiatrist. The stigma around BPD means they tend to be very careful about diagnosing it. It is not something to take casually and start dropping on people. For your own sake.
BPD,fgdjijm,t3_exwkfl,1580683132.0,You should check yourself into an inpatient facility. I did it last month. It's a structured break from life that could get you set up on meds and hook you up with a therapist if you don't already have them. I was incredibly reluctant to commit myself but it was the best decision I've made in a while. If you have questions or just wanna chat you can ask here or msg me.
BPD,fgdbzaf,t1_fgdbg41,1580680906.0,"No worries, it's all good :) I was salty from that other persons comment. That ""Bye."" shit was super juvenile and lame. Set me up to be bitchy haha. You have a nice day too!"
BPD,fgda1f3,t1_fgd920b,1580680324.0,Ok. Jesus.
BPD,fgd8d0t,t1_fgd6aat,1580679929.0,"Yeah. Codependent because we were each other's....favorite person. See what I'm saying? Well she was mine. I think I made her top 3 at least. I don't understand what's so controversial about this FP phrase. I don't use it and wasn't aware of it until recently but it's just a shorthand way to describe something that we tend to do. I think folks use it cause it sounds a little nicer and less toxic than what occurs. I'm all about honesty, let's use CS or Codependent Shitshow from now on."
BPD,fgbkckw,t1_fgbdmil,1580662979.0,Exactly. It's not some radical new symptom of BPD. It's just a relationship more intense than is normal or acceptable. Just like every emotion is more intense. I don't use the phrase but it's easy to understand. Straight up claiming it doesn't exist is bizarre to me.
BPD,fgbdcqw,t3_exn8cr,1580660937.0,"Same. I was warned about her boundaries but even then I couldn't stop myself. I just wanted to hear from her or hold her again. She told me she needed time and space to deal with some personal stuff. I'd feel like making it a day or two was some big fucking accomplishment. It was torture, if we weren't talking then she was gone and I didn't know if she'd come back. Why the fuck would she? I don't know why she ever liked me but she did and having a best friend that felt the same way was so precious to me that I loved it to death like Lennie with a godddamn rabbit. I pestered her with texts and I helped her relapse over a drunken weekend that ended with us briefly fooling around. It was all fubar and I haven't seen her since. There have been sporadic texts but only cause I keep trying to get another chance. They're all of the ""I wish you all the best please take care of yourself"" variety. It's donezo. Its not like I don't understand why she had to leave. I absolutely do. I don't know if that makes it better or worse.

I wish I had a redo. I wish I didn't have this stupid mental illness. I wish I was someone else."
BPD,fgb7bag,t1_fgaao9j,1580659237.0,"It's definitely not made up. There's no single way to describe it but yes, a lot of people(most) with BPD tend to focus on one person in particular. By the time I even heard the phrase I'd already had my best friend tell me ""I love you but I'm not your savior"" and that I needed to stop telling her how amazing she was and how she changed my life and blah blah blah. It's just the emotions of a friendship or romantic relationship turned up to 11 like we tend to do. Not a hard concept to understand."
BPD,fgb5dwc,t3_exobui,1580658716.0,"Yeah it's normal. I basically did the same thing a few months back. Cut myself, lost my shit on FB, had to be talked down. I ended up sleeping through Thanksgiving, Christmas and my Birthday. Totally numb, I lost 20 pounds in 3 weeks. Be very vigilant about it because once I went that far it was easy to jump right back to that level. It escalated over a while the 1st time. After that it was like ""Oh they ignored my text, guess I'll get the knife again."" I committed myself for 3 days a few weeks back. It's better with meds and therapy but it got scary so be careful."
BPD,fgb3jm0,t3_expzpy,1580658222.0,So your therapist established you meet 5 or more of the 9 symptoms? What does your friend think the signs of BPD are? If she's familiar with the criteria at all then she'd know a lot of it isn't immediately obvious. Like you can't just meet someone and see it. Sounds like she has some stereotypes in mind.
KeepWriting,fg8h2el,t1_fg8gaqh,1580619269.0,"Fair enough, thanks for being honest! I went ahead and added the intro back. It's goofy but I do think it needs something a bit weirder and less mundane like you said."

KeepWriting,ff6kxnj,t3_erx8vo,1579629406.0,"It's good, obviously you feel it. I would suggest changing the ""Remember"" parts to declarative statements. Throw them out like punches to the gut. ""We were so in love."" ""You hit my face till it bled."" etc. Make us feel how it makes you feel."

General Impressions/Critique/Help with punctuation and spacing and such. Just whatever honestly.

Intake


I didn't expect the ward to be so crowded. I've been sitting in a plastic chair pulled up to the room length desk for an hour. Group therapy is in session in the day room beside me. I can't hear what he's saying but I watch him. He waves his arms and bounces on black vinyl high top chucks. I can see where he's doodled on the sides. I can see the whiteboard and the words Codependency, BPD, Shame. Goddammit this is the therapy for me but I can't hear it. I can only sit and watch while the  intake staff goes through my suitcase and stuffs my shit into a paper sack. The therapist writes the phrase ""Realm of the hungry ghosts"" on the board. I want so badly to know what the hell that means. I try to creep out of my chair towards the day room. Unfortunately two men approach and request to see my weiner. They take me into the bathroom and politely have me strip one item of clothing at a time so they can check it. The main event is saved for last of course. They tell me I can just pull my boxer briefs down a bit and turn around once. My socks are slippery on the cold floor and I turn a little slip into a dick out pirouette while my drawers drop to my ankles. I bend over to grab them and realize I just presented my butthole. I immediately stand up, turn around and start brainstorming a joke to break the tension but I decide to be an adult. They're professionals, I'm making a big deal out of nothing. That's why I'm here, to change my behavior and stop my shame spirals. I congratulate my maturity. I don't know how long I'm in my head and one of the guys says ""Ok...so we're done with that part."" Ah, my bad. I tuck my penis away and I stay very quiet.

505A


At some point the sun sets and I'm led to my room. My roommate is Bryce. He's in his late 30s, clean cut and irritatingly handsome. It's his last night before he gets to go home. He fist bumps me. Oh God, I'm in the nut hatch and I'm rooming with a bro. Perfect. The bed is what I expected, all plastic and thin. There's a little shelf beside my head and a wall of wooden cubby holes beside the curtained bathroom. There's a bright light low on the wall beside the door. It can't be turned off. I pretend it's a reading light. I try to convince myself that I'm comfortable and read while Bryce showers.


""I'm losing my mind. I'm losing my mind.""

Bryce is quietly mumbling these words and wandering back and forth between the cubbies and his bed. He has shirts and pants laid out on the bed. He puts them on and puts on his shoes. He washes his hands. He takes them off and puts on another shirt and another pair of pants and a new pair of shoes. He walks out into the hall and back inside briskly. He washes his hands. I hear him whisper ""Okay, aaaaand I am done."" He takes off his shoes and lines them up at the end of his bed. He washes his hands. He is not a bro. I am an asshole.


Something about the moonlight on his bed and the folded clothes for tomorrow hits me in the throat. It reminds me of my dad. It reminds me of the chaotic life I've been living. Nothing to do, nowhere to go, very few responsibilities. I've been freefalling for years, it's not a secret. Bryce is trapped in patterns and rituals. Order and Disorder. Felix and Oscar. I turn to the wall and stare at the suicide light while hot tears run down my face. The door can't be shut completely but we've got it at just a crack to block the dim hall lights. It creaks open and a guy with a clipboard peeks in at me and checks the Still Alive box on his form. I assume. Bryce mumbles that he's a jerk for coming in so late. I don't tell him that whatever I told them apparently triggered these little visits every 15 minutes. All night. Bryce groans with his hands on his face 15 minutes later when the door creaks open again and he figures it out.


Sorry brother."

And he wrote one of my all time favorite books, Homicide: A Year On The Killing Streets. So when I saw this guy tweeting about his dad knowing one of the Detectives in the book(nonfiction), I had to jump in.

Also, David Simon is rather infamous on Twitter. He spends all of his time inventing new curse words and insults to attack and block idiots. He got banned for telling someone  ""You should die of a slow-moving venereal rash that settles in your lying throat."" Then for hoping Jack Dorsey ""died of boils."" Someone asked him once if he enjoyed fans praising his work on Twitter. He said, quite bluntly, not really. He loves and appreciates his fans, but that's not what he uses Twitter for.

You have no idea how afraid I am to reply to his stuff. He is terrifying in his wrath haha. I was so surprised at his responses, he told me shit I didn't know, like half secrets about his work. I highly suggest you get his book and watch his shows. Just...don't talk to him on Twitter 😬

Teachers, test your students. Tell them how many millions of colors exist. Look for children that laugh in disbelief or whisper ""Impossible!"" You can prevent another child from making it to age 15 believing that ""Weiner Dog"" accurately describes his favorite shade of green."

If I do not have corndog in hand at that time then they must fetch me two corndogs. A 3rd infracture results in fetching me antacids and like...an Arnold Palmer or something if Walgreens has it."

AskReddit,et8pogg,t3_cagzo9,1562564730.0,"Woke up in a car. I only knew something was wrong and I couldn't remember things. Popped the door, my arm sizzled and blistered and I was like ""Huh. Fire? That way seems too hot.""

It was all very removed and matter of fact. Didn't feel the burns or heat. Just unbuckled and scooted across the passenger side to slide out. Wandered across the road apparently cause I ended up on my back in front of the Dentist Office with lots of folks looking down and pouting water bottles on my face.

Minor 1st degree burns on my face. 2nd degree where my arm burned. Worst was 2nd degree on the backs of my legs from ankle to knee. But all I remember happened in just a few seconds. Witnesses thought I was totally on fire at the time but I was just smoking heavily from my clothes almost catching.

No idea why it happened to this day. Cops said it was a mystery. Can't even see much more than a mild red tint to my legs 2 years later but I barely made it. On the plus I always kinda wondered if I had a survival instinct and could handle something awful. I do. It's pretty damn good too."

Having said that, when I was a kid I rolled my bike over a spider that turned out to be pregnant. In a very real way I think that left a deeper scar on my psyche."

Spare me and you'll receive the antidote. We can both live. All you have to do is eat Mr. Ramsey. Eat that filthy bird and tell me how much you love it. You better be convincing.
