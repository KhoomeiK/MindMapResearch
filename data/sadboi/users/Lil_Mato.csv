SuicideWatch,fecm0bs,t3_eo9o49,1578977229.0,"Op I was just like you. Scared of what would happen to me if I told how I was feeling, what the consequences were. Instead of help, I found comfort in a knife. But you must understand, it doesn’t have to be this way. There are people who are scared and frightened just as you are. It may seem scary I know it took me 5 years to talk about what I felt. But once you do you will see everyone who cares so much for you and who would do anything for you. They will do everything in their power to help you. You are loved and you are so very special. You are a bright star you just have to allow yourself to shine. You matter and you are cared for way more than you realize. The pain may seem to much to bare but it’s not what defines you as a person. I know you can do it you are amazing and you will beat your battle and you will win your war."
