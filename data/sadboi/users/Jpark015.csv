Your CPU is doing minimal work in the bios so the temperature is going to be low. Most modern CPU’s have an automatic core boost built in when under load which would explain the difference in clock speeds. 

You’re PC seems to be working properly however you may need a better cooling solution. You could try lowering your core voltage as well.. depending on what it’s set on in the bios. Anything over 1.4 is kind of high but Ryzen usually handles boost clocking well by itself and will drop as temperature goes up. Double check what it’s set at. 

Also, try hardwareinfo64. I’ve found this to be pretty accurate."
pcgamingtechsupport,fkqpbpp,t3_fk4igj,1584452377.0,"The only factor that matters when determining compatibility between a monitor and graphics card is the cable to connect them. If the monitor has an hdmi port (which I’m sure it does) and your graphics card has an hdmi port (which I’m sure it does) you shouldn’t have any issue. However if you’re trying to get the 144 HZ, you’ll need to use a display port cable. Just check the back of your graphics card where the cables plug in and see what’s compatible. Then read the specs on the monitor to see what cables can hook up to it."

Anxiety,ff7p9eq,t1_ff7p1nm,1579655021.0,"It’s not easy but it was one of the most rewarding things I’ve done. The best part is, it’s only 30 days. Once that’s up, you can eat however you want. But it will change your diet forever."
Anxiety,ff7o710,t3_es35fr,1579654273.0,"YES! 

I have recently revamped my diet, started exercising again and began mediating. I have found that taking control of the physical health of your body, leads into the mind as well. I read somewhere that your stomach is like your second mind. Whatever you feed your body will effect your body in a certain way. Feed it healthy foods, your body and brain will thank you. Feed it junk food and your body and brain will react accordingly. 

I would recommend doing a round of Whole 30 (you can get more info online by googling it). Basically you cut out all sugar, gluten, soy, legumes, alcohol, dairy, etc. for 30 days and slowly reintroduce these food groups to see how they affect you. It’s amazing to see that the milk you drink every day with dinner is really upsetting your stomach and contributing to your diet (just one example). Your diet basically consists of meat, veggies and fruit. Once you’ve found some food triggers, you now will either know not to eat certain things or why you’re feeling a certain way because you did eat that food group. 

Do a little research on Whole 30 if that sounds interesting. I can tell you from personal experience, it works wonders. I not only felt great but I lost 20 pounds during the whole 30 (6’2” Male went from 195 to 175ish). For me, the key to feeling less anxious is health. All the way. 

Hope this helps! Let me know if you do end up revamping the diet and how it goes."

pcgamingtechsupport,f81i5n4,t1_f819am7,1574168189.0,Look up positive and negative air pressure for your computer chassis. Make sure your two front fans are intaking fresh cold air and that your rear fan is exhausting all that hot air from your GPU. This should make a huge difference.
pcgamingtechsupport,f7ofsr7,t1_f7jpmn5,1573926725.0,"Thanks for the post, this worked briefly but in the end just delayed the inevitable error and drop in frames after that. I don't have an issue streaming for a game or two at max quality and such. But eventually I get an error and even after I close obs the gpu usage skyrockets until I restart my PC. Also, I'm playing natively at 3440x1440. So my base canvas resolution has to be that or you'll only see half of my screen. I tried using x264 encoder and I get solid frames but the quality isn't really there."

pcgamingtechsupport,f7bfl5e,t3_dv2mzx,1573567508.0,Ray-tracing is a huge hit to performance. I mean huge. If you turn that off you’ll have way higher frames. Is your monitor only 60hz?
pcgamingtechsupport,f79mxpg,t1_f79mrid,1573510013.0,Yeah a 9600k won’t bottleneck any graphics card that is out right now. So you’re good!
pcgamingtechsupport,f79midd,t3_duzo8y,1573509811.0,No. Your CPU is more than adequate for a 1080ti. What resolution are you gaming at? Typically the higher you go in resolution the more the GPU is utilized and frames are more dependent on the GPU than the CPU.

pcgamingtechsupport,f5ry3vi,t1_f5rxgft,1572405868.0,It’s going to be tough especially at high settings. Borderlands 3 isn’t the most optimized game. If you’re trying to reach those higher frame rates you’ll need to upgrade the card to at least a 1660ti to get consistent 100+ frames.
ultrawidemasterrace,f5rxsyo,t3_dp0uk7,1572405643.0,"From what I know, you’ve got TN, VA and IPS. TN is obviously best for low response high refresh but so so picture quality. IPS is known for high picture/color quality and viewing angles. VA is a middle ground. Not quite the picture quality as IPS but still much better than TN panels. I don’t think you’d have an issue running games at 3440x1440 at 60 frames with a 1070. You may have to lower some settings. It does seem fishy that they would trade you an ultra wide gsync monitor for the one you currently have. Is there any way you can see the monitor on before you get it?"

Also, I wouldn’t go with the last gen graphics cards such as the 1070/1070Ti. I’d shoot for the 1660ti if you want to save as much money as possible or go up to the 2060 for $330. I’d even advise to save up a little more and get the 2060 super for around $430. You won’t regret saving up a bit longer and spending more on a graphics card, trust me. Since you’ve got the $180 from the faulty 580, I’d put that towards a better graphics card for sure."

Tried a spare card I had laying around and I no longer had the restarts. I returned the card and got a different one and I no longer have issues. You can either wait for new drivers and hope that fixes the issue, deal with a couple restarts a week or just go through the RMA process.
