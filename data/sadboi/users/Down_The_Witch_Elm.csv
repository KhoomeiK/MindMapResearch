The radiation had really destroyed my muscles and blood vessels.  The ulcer kept growing, and it was extremely painful to stand or walk.  I had skin grafts and spent time each day in a hyperbaric chamber.  They all failed.

My surgeon wanted to cut into my abdomen and remove a section of healthy artery and graft it onto my leg to improve the blood supply.  By this time, I had been off of work for at least a month.  While I had the skin grafts, I had to stay in bed except for trips to the hospital for hyperbaric treatments.

Anyway, I told the surgeon that I really didn't think the graft was going to work, and I knew it was going to be amputated above the knee, anyway.  I had known that, really, for quite awhile.  

So, that's how I decided to just get it over with and get back into my job and my life.  I've never regretted it.  After the surgery and the necropsy, he told me that I had been right.  There was not enough unaffected tissue for a graft to work.  

No one can tell you what to do in this situation.  It's your decision.  You need to do what you think is best.  I think you've presented your case pretty well."

They probably don't do that anymore.  I got into some poison oak, and I had the worst outbreak ever.  It just about broke me mentally.  I would be very careful if I were you.  I was given Cytoxan, Vincristine, and Adriamycin.  I think they're still using these very, very powerful drugs."
