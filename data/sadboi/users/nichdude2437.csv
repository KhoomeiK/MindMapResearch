It will still burn until the day you die but you might be able to alleviate it. I recommend holding on to the memory of your girlfriend, as I know you will, despite people saying move on. If it helps I think you need to find a purpose and/or someway for you to let her live on with you in life. I do not know how but maybe try being a light for others like she was for you. This is difficult, and you might need to force yourself to but I think in the end you will get some semblance of peace. I hope this helped, sorry about her she sounds amazing."
