Trying SO hard not to kill myself over something very small, because I know I will feel better again. But in the moment, it feels like everything is on fire around you."

BPD,foaq2l4,t3_g6ft9k,1587650723.0,"I admitted myself to the hospital and experienced something similar. I was actively suicidal, had been sobbing for 2 straight days, and had been isolating hardcore. Someone caught me while I was writing my letter and I agreed to go get help. I went in with a bag full of clothes, hygiene products, art supplies, and a book. They took all of my things except 2 pairs of clothes, a couple hygiene supplies, and the book. This is when I started to question what I was doing, was this really worth it? Would it even help?  

But by then I was admitted and being led to the wing. The first two days were really horrible, I felt so trapped and it was causing many panic attacks. I was easily the most unstable one there—the typical stay at this wing was around 3 days. I was there a week and a half, and saw many people come and go. They wouldn’t discharge me because of my continual emotional outbursts. 

At first I considered lying to get out fast like everyone else, but my behaviors were betraying me. But I decided while I was there, I would make the most of It. By the end, I was having less episodes but still severely wanted to kill myself. I decided I was acting well enough that I could convince them I was fixed and ready to go home. Little did I know, though a lot of anxiety was surrounded by leaving the hospital, I actually was ready to leave. 

I was discharged and thought I would just go back to being the suicidal piece of shit I usually am, but the long stay seemed to actually help. It put me on a good sleep schedule, got me eating healthier, working out and yoga every day. I continued these habits after leaving, and have been consistent with my new medication (which I usually am not). I don’t care to kill myself as much as I have most of my life. It was weird, when I was being discharged, they asked the golden question: “Are you having thoughts of harming yourself?” I lied, and said no—in the hospital I didn’t feel safe to go home. But once I was home, I felt so much better. 

So my advice to people is, even though being in the hospital is not the best of situations, I urge you to stay as long as you need (not want)—but leave before you get too comfortable. And when you’re there, actively participate and work on yourself. Take your meds. Don’t get discouraged at everyone getting better faster than you. Everyone heals on their own timeline."

BPD,fo99fym,t1_fo97rxj,1587613667.0,"I didn’t even know what a FP was until a year or so ago. It made complete sense to me and also really resonated with me. I had begun to notice how I was constantly filling my void with people and relationships, typically focusing on 1-3 people—where every action they do, I notice, and react to in some way shape or form. For me, I have only experienced this  (not having a FP) twice in my entire life. And each time, to get here, I had to have a dramatic event happen in my life, usually hitting rock bottom. The first time, I left an abusive relationship and quit using opiates—once I was out of withdrawal, I was an entirely new person (or what my family and friends call the “real” me). This time, I was admitted to the hospital (suicidal tendencies) and stayed there almost 2 weeks. When I came out, I was “me” again. Rock bottom for me is when I am faced with one question; do you want to live, or do you want to die? And both times, I have chosen life. It is a fleeting feeling of being motivated, and not necessarily joyful, but content, and a desire to improve. It is only in these times that I do not have a FP because during these times, I have clarity in my vision and know that I am the one that needs the love and attention right now. And instead of seeking that from others, I look inward. But like I said, it’s only happened twice, and the first time didn’t even last a year. We’ll see how long I keep it up this time."

questions,fk0abnp,t3_ffjf2j,1583749491.0,"I have had trouble with this distinction as well. For me, I’ll associate sexual feelings, attraction, admiration and intimacy all together but they can totally be separate. Like, just because you had an intimate moment with a friend, doesn’t mean you have to or want to have sex with them. Or just because you admire someone doesn’t mean you’re in love with them. There IS a certain distinction—and for me, it’s more of an impulse issue. If I’m feeling it in the moment, I may pursue in some shape or form. But lately I’ve been holding back and seeing how often events/feelings occur. Idk. Relationships are difficult in all their forms."

But I noticed I started to imagine myself as the aggressor and I would cum so hard, throbbing for minutes afterwards. However, I would feel intense shame. I think as long as we play out our fantasies respectfully and consensually, or just keep them fantasies, we’re good."
