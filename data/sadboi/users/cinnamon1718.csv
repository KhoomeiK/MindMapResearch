elderscrollsonline,fgq0ri2,t3_ezwkfs,1581015685.0,"To answer some of your questions:

Yes you can respec later, you actually get a scroll as you level up that allows you to respec any skills you’d like for free.

Crafting is a little complex but once you play the game a little, it isn’t that hard to understand. If you do want to become a crafter make sure to research traits right away and deconstruct any leftover armor, weapons, etc. to level up the crafting skill trees.

Endgame content is fantastic—veteran DLC dungeons are a good challenge (especially with hard mode) and veteran trials (12 man raids) are very difficult but very rewarding, as trials drop some of the best gear in the game (and you can get skins, personalities, etc. for completing hard vet challenges in dungeons and trials). As for solo content, the hardest solo content as of right now is veteran maelstrom arena. It really does test your skills as a player and if you are skilled enough to beat it, it drops some of the best and most desired weapons in the game (maelstrom inferno/lightning staff, maelstrom bow, etc.)

Overall, eso is fantastic and I would definitely recommend trying it out, especially since you don’t even need to buy the subscription. Personally, what I did was play the base game until I did everything I wanted to, then I went for the subscription and it is 100% worth it."

The setup I used was BSW (front bar), Maelstrom inferno staff (back bar), Robes of Destruction Mastery (false gods might be a better choice though), and Iceheart. As for tips, since DK don’t have much for heals (basically only burning embers), make sure to have at least 20k health and what helped me A LOT was having harness magicka (light armor skill) on both my skill bars. Having the ability to spam a shield on both my bars really made it a lot easier. 

Also, for regular healing make sure to use burning embers on as many enemies as you can, that way if you are low on health all you have to do is strike an enemy with BE and you will get a big heal.

For food, I would recommend bewitched sugar skulls for the added health recovery as well.

elderscrollsonline,ffg64r1,t1_ffg5plk,1579899276.0,"Yeah DK can be tricky on the heal side of things since basically the only thing DKs have for healing is burning embers, and even then you have to hit enemies at least twice before it heals (or let it run out).

- Combat metrics - if you are a DPS it will tell you how much damage per second you are doing, as well as exactly how much damage you are doing with each skill you are using and other useful things, also if you are a healer how much healing you are doing.

- There are also addons that allow you to click a certain key on your keyboard and it will automatically give you that armor without you having to manually swap it out (very useful if you need to swap out gear during trials/dungeons and you can quickly do that between fights). 

 - Tamriel Trade Center gives you good and accurate estimates on how much things are selling for, and you can use this to sell items accurately (get the most gold you can and have it sell fast) as well as buying items (you will be able to tell if you are about to overspend or see a really good deal).
