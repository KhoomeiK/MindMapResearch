abusiveparents,fpqtmr4,t1_fpqgcgd,1588831876.0,"I see...ok but even so I think it's better for them to ask their parents first to go to the grandparents house right? No harm done? I think my kind of fear is...adults want u to be mature. It doesnt matter if the adults themselves seem like they r or arent or just r or arent...what I'm afraid of is something like this happening..bc I can kind of imagine it with my parentsðŸ˜…:

U and ur friend sneak away to the grandparents house (let's say grandparents r on ur side)...parents come and argue with them..main argument?: see they're too immature and irresponsible they didnt even talk to us about this...something like that uk?ðŸ˜… 

But also u should really try to ask ur friend to talk to the parents first and if that doesnt work then ask the grandparents for some helpðŸ˜… but anyways ya I get u I really do wish yall the best of luck...(thanks so much for being such a good friend to ur friend XP)"
abusiveparents,fpqc49a,t3_gevtca,1588819507.0,"I'm sorry I'm only a little older than ur friendðŸ˜… so I'm not sure I'll be that much of help...especially legally...but first, I'm pretty sure u cant just adopt a child when they're not up for adoptionðŸ˜… like their parents would have to ""give them up"" and I'm assuming its unlikely to happen...I'm not sure if kinda ""stealing"" ur friend and bringing them to ur grandparents would exactly make the grandparents and parents see maturity or make them trust u...which is kinda what u want. So I think maybe the best option would first be to ask ur friend (and maybe u can help on the sidelines too but it should probably be between the family first) to try and talk it out with his/her parents and make some kind of plan or compromise (although ik this will be very uncomfortable and difficult for him/herðŸ˜…) and if that doesnt work them maybe he/she can ASK for u to take them to their grandparents or something and then consult...I'm happy ur so protective for ur friend tho that's nice...ik abuse is..really rough..but ya just keep in mind u/ur friend wants to try to talk things out like adults..u cant just have some unrealistic runaway scene (no offense meantðŸ˜… I'm sorry if my tone over text sounds rude) and also the parents have custody over their child so they could just call the cops and take him/her back so ya...be rational, mature, and safe.
