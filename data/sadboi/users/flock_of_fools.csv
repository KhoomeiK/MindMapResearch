... it's that any flag where the stripes are so specific to individual identity labels that may or may not even *be in use* far into the future will always fail to represent *somebody.* When you focus on identity labels as the basis for what you're representing, it won't age well and it will always leave out other labels, identities, and experiences that couldn't fit on the flag. 

Another example: the Voidpunk flag. In trying to represent *some* of the groups that originally founded/gravitated toward the concept (aces, aros, neurodivergent, and nonbinary people) they left out *every other group* that could find themselves in Voidpunk based on age/race/ethnicity/disability/intersex status/etc, and as a physically disabled person it still kinda pisses me off that I'm left out of that flag when it comes to my disabilities, which is the majority of my voidpunk stuff?

plural,fo6sexj,t1_fo3v6g2,1587565830.0,"Is there anything I could clarify about the nonhumanity? I'm nonhuman due to how our plurality works (there's few humans in our group at all) and it's a pretty significant part of my identity personally, but I wouldn't be sure where to start there.

Discovering we're plural led eventually to me figuring out things like ""Im not the 'original' and I'm not sure we have one"" and subsequently that I wasn't even the same person as the one ""I"" was during high school -- he was a NB masc person who went by he/him and had very different feelings and thoughts from me. I have his memories, but he doesn't feel like me. It explained why my gender seemed to kinda drastically change when I hit 18 and everything cascaded? 

And figuring out further that wei're median is what helped me figure out why I seem to be unable to settle on a single identity and keep shuffling through different ideas of who ""I"" am. I used to think I was just extremely identity-confused, but now it makes sense that there's a pattern to these changes and it's based in which facet is front. So like ... all of me is aromantic, but some facets identify with that and one other identifies more as demisexual. Or all of us fit into the kind of fem/xeno side of gender, but how that gender fits or feels will vary between facets. And my level of dysphoria and what specifically I have it over? also depends on facet. 

So figuring out I'm not one person, but a bunch of facets in a coat pretending to be one person in a system (cuz this is still all just my subsystem) was pretty vital to actually understanding myself and all my identity confusion. 

I started figuring out I was queer and alterhuman (by way of therianthropy) when I was 11, so I had 7 or so years between that and awakening as plural. But I'm 100% certain that awakening as queer and therian is what led me down the path to eventually discovering our plurality. 

I spent my whole childhood through my teen years hiding. Hiding my orientation, my gender, my religious beliefs, my therianthropy, everything. Now I'm an adult and I'm sick of hiding and have nothing left to really lose by being out, so we're out as we can be.

At the same time I know dissociated/repressed memories and a disjointed past where some of it was hidden from you or you just totally forgot? Are terrifying. I have those and it's terrifying. I just wanna validate any feelings you're having in response to that because it's a lot to take in. It's a lot. 

But at the same time, that trauma and pain doesn't have to be what your system is about, just something you may all have to work through, depending on who's been impacted by what.

It makes sense all this would come up for you after you finally get help for other things. The brain tends not to give us these memories, nor do headmates tend to feel safe to show themselves, until you're in a more stable place or in a better state of mind or out of traumatic situations or all three, yknow?

intersex,fo3yor5,t3_g50cmo,1587495204.0,"I've got suspected NCAH (same diagnosis boat) and have talked about my experiences with T in some other posts I think you've seen, but my experience with going on T was that I'm *really* sensitive to even low doses of it (15mg/week subcutaneous injections were giving me changes within the first week and through the month; 40mg/week was putting me at really solidly ""average male"" testosterone levels when every dyadic trans guy I've heard from has said it took 100mg/week to get that for them? (Im not a trans guy and *wanted* a lower dose bc Im nonbinary, but it uhhhh didn't turn out as low as expected.) 

So with having a condition on the same spectrum I'd say it's a safe bet that T could be something you're already sensitive to and you might need to start at the lowest possible dose (I was told 15mg/week is the lowest) and work up if you feel like you want more? I was told it's a safer way of doing T in general to taper it up like any other medication, but it might be an especially good idea just to see how you react and what dose you need for your body, since there's not really anything *I've* found at least on how to help intersex trans people with HRT. Most of what I do find (relevant to this) is just about how to put ppl w/ CAH solidly back on estrogen. :/

Other thing I've personally noticed happens just with my natural T cycles and can happen with injection cycles (they have peaks n troughs too) is that during trough periods of low T, I get *really ragey* sometimes. I think overall just paying really close attention to your body and mental health and how you react over time is super important. 

And also I'd get an endocrinologist specifically to help you with HRT, since you *can* get it through a primary care doctor in some places (I did), but you'll definitely want someone with some experience helping both trans people and people with your intersex variation. Or at least someone who is very open to you advocating for yourself and learning about the things they need to quickly and on their own time so they can help you.

Ask_Intersex,fo39h8k,t3_g4ku0m,1587483015.0,"Oh man I feel like I dont see as much about those of us who don't figure stuff out till way later? It's nice to be reminded it's not just me I guess. 

Ok so I break this up into three sections: the symptoms I had as a kid but nobody recognized, the suspicions I had as a teen, and then my recent medical uhhh ... what's a snappy way of saying ""awful fucking journey?"" 

So I had a precocious puberty. Like it was in full swing by the time I was 9. Add to that the way I think that rapid early growth spurt and sudden stopping of growth when I was 13 (short forever club :V) is what made my scoliosis worse than my mom's ever was. I think I knew there was something weird on some level, because I remember being *really invested* in learning everything I could find on the internet about puberty (for kids my age.) I realized none of the other kids were going through what I was yet. 

Flash forward to be being 18 and transgender and finally able to start HRT (the first time;; that was its own struggle). I get my blood tests done and they come back w/ elevated T levels. I get a hyperandrogenism diagnosis. I'm started on 15mg/week of subcutaneous T, and I have visible bottom growth within the week. When I told my endo Im pretty sure she either said nothing because it was suspicious and she didn't wanna tell me, or else she didn't believe me. I wasn't with her much longer bc life circumstances. 

So that started it. It started with one weird diagnosis and some extreme sensitivity to testosterone. And that's how it continued when later blood tests would come back elevated but still ""within average range"" enough for people to brush it off but I still reacted so strongly to HRT that my progress on a low dose (40mg/week, sometimes skipping weeks) was essentially equivalent to the progress of several others I knew who were on ""full dose"" HRT for *years.* And I was only on HRT for a year and a half before I stopped because I wasn't happy with the way my voice kept dropping immediately after every injection. This is what had me *seriously* questioning my intersex status, because most people in my demographics dont react like I did to HRT. But because the interactions between intersex variations and medical transition aren't really studied or given much attention, it's not really like I had a whole lot to go off of. :/

From there, I'm in my mid 20s now and I've been brushed off because I ""look too normal,"" I've been told multiple times that if I don't wanna get pregnant then there's no reason to test or care if I have a variation or not, I've been told ""not to worry"" and aggressively ""reassured"" of how ""normal"" i might actually be (while shoving me in the ""woman"" box so they can reassure me i'll be a normal *woman* specifically, when I am in fact not a woman and don't hide this), I've been told specifically by doctors who wouldn't test me not to take out loans for private testing, and in general it's been hellish dealing with the medical world and trying to get anyone to care about anything other than my stupid uterus!! 

And all of these happened across both the period of time where all my virilization was happening on HRT *and* the period of time now where I've been off HRT for nearly two years and my body has started producing it's own testosterone at high levels again and I'm *visibly* sex variant by nature and not just HRT. 

Do I have a diagnosis now because it's finally obvious what variation I have? Nope! They tested for *literally every other potential cause,* and when nothing else turned up and I asked specifically for the testing to be done for the variation I suspect, guess what I was told?

We only test for that when fertility is an issue. 

( : 

Fuck doctors is the moral of the story. It took me like 6 years from first strong suspicion to finally having at least an honest self-diagnosis of exclusion and that's probably the *best* Im gonna be able to hope for. And I know that in the grand scheme of things, my experiences are kinda *mild* compared to some of the horror stories I've heard about dealing w/ doctors."
plural,fo27jye,t1_fo1ynqb,1587452259.0,"Well, as a median within our larger system, the genders + orientations wei experience fluctuate based on facet, but are also sort of mushed together to equal out into an ""overall"" sense of gender and orientation that harmonizes pretty well. All the facets make up a single person, so wei're so intertwined wei can't *not* count both individual facet experiences and the experience of the Whole? So plurality impacts gender/orientation there. 

Likewise, being nonhuman, which is related to/a result of/part of my plural experience affects my sense of gender and orientation. Nonhumans have non-human genders, yknow? And I tend to be more interested in other sentient nonhumans/nonhuman-IDing people than ones who aren't. 

Likewise, we have multiple members of our group who are trans* in different ways, and only one intersex body. So we have to make compromises on transition and use resources for both transfem and transmasc audiences to make it work for us. And that impacts *all* of us. And having an intersex body out here makes different people in the group feel differently about their relationship to it? 

And polyamory is a huge part of being plural for us! Not only with intra-system relationships, but multiple cross-system relationships! many many plurals end up also being polyamorous or benefiting from that style of relationship just because it's easier to work out? 

Add to that that I wouldn't exactly call intra-system relationships accepted in any significant way, and that they're discouraged or seen as unhealthy, and in terms of queer in the philosophical sense I'd say our intra-system relationships are pretty queer on their own. We certainly have to hide it, my partnerships aren't validated widely nor seen by many as healthy or natural or as fulfilling as relationships between people in separate bodies, we have to come out about being together ... 

i mean hell, the biggest comparison between discovering and *being* myself and for the others to be themselves has been *coming out.* But in the case of plurals, we're literally coming out as *existing at all* in the way we do. People like *actually* don't believe we exist. In such a more literal way than I experience as a NB trans person who basically tunes out ""there's only two genders.' That's transphobic af, but it doesn't challenge my *actual real personhood and existence and right to them* like some other singlet shit yknow? 

Intersection exists, even in plurality. Probably especially in plurals, tbh. A lot of the experiences parallel. Some feel far worse for some than others, your mileage may vary and all that, (and tbh it's not the transphobia that feels worse for us, I'd say. It's definitely the singletism/pluralphobia that hits worse) but there's parallels a-plenty and even more room for entire systems of LGBTQIA+ people with experiences to share that they have in common between being plural and lgbtqia+

Like i'd rather nobody have to deal with that but I feel like there's this weird intersection of misogyny (regardless of your actual gender, bc its more about their assumptions about our genders + bodies) and intersexism in the form of only caring if you wanna have kids or wanna get reproductive procedures or birth control of some kind. Otherwise they just totally ignore you, depending on the variation."
intersex,fo0g0f6,t3_g4y648,1587412458.0,"This!! Im so sorry you've had to defend your own intersex status, OP. That's messed up. I've seen a lot of exclusion around here and it's really difficult to feel alright to post here when I see even misinfo about other variations be used to exclude them?

I'm also super tired of the people excluding others based on the misconception that being intersex means ""being both male and female"" and sometimes *only* accepting it if you have intersex-appearing genitals or ovotestes? Which is ... kind of what we've been trying to get dyadics to *stop* stereotyping us as? 

Likewise with policing of diagnostic status? Like, yea it's important to actually get some kind of medical info on what your body is or might be doing in order to be able to call yourself intersex, because it's not something you can just identify into without having the experience. But it's also the experience of *so many* intersex people, myself included, that our diagnoses are obscured or we're refused testing or any number of things that make it incredibly difficult to be 100% perfectly diagnosed. A lot of us just have best guesses. 

Mine is a self-diagnosis of exclusion since I got tested for *every other* possibility, and then they refused to test for the variation I fit 100% and that was the last remaining possibility. So like. I probably have that condition, I think it's safe to say. Especially considering my body will do what it's doing regardless of having a diagnostic code slapped on me. 

I don't get it. Inclusion of sex variant people who have similar struggles is not a bad thing and only weakens the sex binary more and more over time. Exclusion just makes our community smaller, more divided, more hostile, and leaves countless people without language or people to talk to about their experiences with."

These first questions are rhetorical. Im just putting these here to ask yourself, because i am a stranger on the internet and dont actually want  your personal info like mental health history n stuff. Im just a schizophrenic witch who's had to practice with magic and discernement a lot. 

Do you already know what stressors might be setting off the panic and the fear of being watched? What are the major stressors in your life and around your new craft that might be setting these symptoms off? Maybe ones you might forget to consider? Many problems can cause someone to feel this way.

And also important is

Do you have any mental health diagnoses or conditions you might be prone to due to experience or family history (e.g. schizophrenia, anxiety, etc) ? If you already have a diagnosis are you in some kind of treatment for it like medication or therapy? Have you considered matching up with a therapist to talk about any of these distressing things?

schizophrenia,fmp3xfo,t3_fwlp3g,1586273969.0,"Well, first lemme say writing is cool and Im glad you came to ask some folks about what our real experiences are before just going ahead and writing a book full of assumptions. That's good of you, and honestly I should write a guide for this to link to people. I also wanna give a headsup that part of schizophrenia for me is not being able to uh .. Be brief. In anything. So apologies for length but i wanted to cover things thoroughly.

But that aside! Here we go!

Ok so. First I wanna clear up that whole ""people with schizophrenia dont know they're schizophrenic"" thing, because there's truth to it but not in the ""crazy people dont know theyre crazy"" ableist way that assumes we're just too nuts to understand what's going on. 

What actually happened for me when I was around the age of the character you're writing is that stress (especially from abusive parents) caused me to hallucinate and have weird thoughts, but they were such small events or so confusing or so mundane that I didnt notice them,  (or else explained it as a spirit bc i was inclined that way) and so *thats* why i didnt notice I was experiencing anything too out of the ordinary. Hearing footsteps, feeling people standing somewhere when they aren't, having Alice in Wonderland Syndrome-type hallucinations (i'd wonder why all the furniture suddenly looked so big/small?), all these things were just subtly weird to me, so I didnt realize. A lot of it is just that it feels so real and is so normal-seeming or like ... Plausible? That when it gets out of control and much less believable, we already had the little experiences and the ""maybes"" enough to build up an idea in our heads that we have a hard time then believing isnt real. 

But when I hit my early 20s i had my first serious psychotic episode where I noticed feeling weird, then watched, then *watched by hidden agents.* and so on. That mess evolved several times over the course of a night, but I retained enough lucidity to kiiiiiinda be able to figure out i was maybe going a bit nuts, but afterwards I was definitely able to say ""that was a delusion."" I was aware i wasn't doing super hot :V 

And ofc there's every level in-between of both experiencing symptoms and how lucid one is vs not while experiencing them. 

As for recovery/management of symptoms, unless there's a big timelapse in that story, Im unsure how much you could write a realistic ""recovery."" Honestly I'd stick to the idea of just learning to live with one's experiences as treatment and leave it there. No ""recovery"" (i personally dont feel like thats a word that can apply to us but others disagree and thats its own issue to maybe not tackle) is going to be finished by the end of a book, let alone finished at all, and its always a bumpy road and there's always potential for setbacks and yknow. Learning to live in your own head is a lifelong struggle. 

Id also question the plot. Is the whole story just about her being paranoid, and at the end the surprise twist is that she was schizo the whole time? Cuz that would personally be really annoying to me and fall into the same category as other bad movies and stuff that use our experiences and diagnosis as a gotcha or twist or bad trope in general. Don't do that, especially since you have no idea what that would be like enough to write it. If you wanna write about a character with schizophrenia where that becomes a challenge to work through in order to solve a real mystery or something then that would be so much cooler and would normalize schizophrenia more and make it less sensational and shock-factor-y. 

Also to think about is what her symptoms actually are. You cant just write somebody being paranoid and seeing things and capture the experience correctly. Not all of us even really see/hear things much (i dont as much), some of us have more negative symptoms that take away our ability to care about things, or that give us the quirk of being hard to read under a flat affect (i might be smiling genuinely and someone would see a sarcastic not-smile instead, as one example), or other symptons like really disorganized thoughts and odd speech (i have more examples of that if u want), or delusions of course (which we can be aware of are delusions and still believe at the same time, might have no idea isnt true, or could be anywhere else on that scale of lucidity). Consider her symptoms. Dont just write a stereotype. 

And tbh I wanna know why she's developing schizophrenia quickly and out of the blue? I dont know if thats common without a triggering event? Possible absolutely! but personally ive had symptoms my whole life and even when it blew up in college it took me years both to 1. Get ""worse"" to the point of settling 2. even realize on my own it was schizophrenia and not part of my Borderline PD and at-the-time suspected autism (lots of overlap and history between schizophrenia and autism actually) and 3. find a psychiatrist willing to diagnose me with the thing my therapist and i were agreeing was schizoaffective, because my first one tried to dismiss that I was even psychotic. This isnt uncommon, for doctors to delay a ""scary"" diagnosis or refuse to give them, especially in someone so young honestly (and if we're even more honest, especially because she's a girl and women+nb people face more discrimination in healthcare) so again that rapidly-setting-in schizophrenia isnt gonna set in and then be perfectly coped with by the end of one book. It takes a lot to even get help first. Consider parents a realistic potential obstacle to help too. They could be good parents ofc but i cant help you write those realistically sadly.

I'll end here since thats all i got to go off of, but replies and DMs and whatever are all good if you have questions or if i said something that was hard to understand and you need me to reword it."
intersex,fmjk0e5,t1_fmcjfde,1586131868.0,"The short answer is: nonbinary people struggle to define ourselves and find community specifically because so many of the ways we talk about attraction are binary, and some of us choose to define it based on how we relate to the history and culture of a word and if we look at those relationships and see ourselves in any way. It's complicated and just trust NB people to define ourselves and our unique experiences. Also some NB people partially identify as women or with womanhood. 

The longer answer is that there's been a very long history of lesbians not feeling like women, not identifying as women, etc but instead as lesbians, dykes, butches, femmes, etc because of how complicated the lesbian relationship to gender can be when a culturally defining part of ""womanhood"" is attractiveness to and attraction to men.

I said PCOS *can* be considered intersex *if the individual considers themself such.* 

Which covers the fact that there are people with PCOS who do *not* feel intersex, yes. 

I only got confused because your reply seemed to be trying to argue that PCOS *isn't* intersex? Because I already thoroughly expressed that *individuals* may or may not identify as intersex based on having PCOS. 

But as we're on the same page here there's nothing more to say. Apologies for the miscommunication."
intersex,fld9qxt,t1_flb5qds,1585059936.0,"PCOS *can* be an intersex variation, I didn't say it was exclusive to intersex people. Just that some people with PCOS share enough experiences in common with other intersex people (atypical pubertal development, being forced to take hormones as a child or teen, sex characteristics not matching the expectation for one's AGAB, etc) that they are more than welcome to call themselves intersex. 

Gatekeeping who is and isn't intersex enough to count won't do us any favors. The push not to consider PCOS an intersex condition is one that minimizes how common sex variance in general actually is -- much more than people want us to believe."

I understand it's well-intentioned, but you're definitely coming out the gate already being kinda fetishistic of specific conditions.

You were looking for cisgender participants to talk about binary gender and how they relate to it, if I understand the way you worded it in another comment. 

It's important to use clear, accurate, and unbiased wording as much as possible when conducting a survey, so I'd suggest going back to the drawing board and researching some more on how to talk about gender before addressing the topic.

Also y'know. Don't tell people to ""fuck off"" in your survey."

My issue is that you  acknowledge that the survey taker could be non-binary and then don't provide that as a gender option for health professionals, just as a first example, but it continues through the rest of the survey. There are non-binary professionals and non-binary people throughout life and we should be included across the board if gender is a factor in this survey.

I get this is for your class grade n all, and it's due already, but in the future I'd definitely more carefully consider your survey design and choices."

What im trying to challenge, though, is the definition of ""human."" Even scientifically. Because again, science also cannot agree on what a species is, and historically ""science"" was used to try and *literally* separate people by race to say that other races (namely black people) literally weren't the same species. So even there we cannot trust a definition of human. 

Philosophically Im not human, socially Im not human, and scientifically? Well like I said. I'd have the same DNA as nearly anyone reading this. Thats as far as Im personally willing to concede any affiliation with humanity. I don't mean to say that you have to feel the same way of course!

Punk however isnt just fashion, and it doesn't matter if the mainstream idea of punk has become removed from the original intention, because punks still exist and are still bashing the fash. The key difference here being that punks are actively anti-fascist and had something to say, and all the hipsters I knew were milquetoast liberals just trying to follow a fashion and music trend mostly catering to mentally ill and queer young people as a form of self-expression. That was it.

Some things claim to be counter-culture. The important thing is *acting* it."

I mean hell, one of Bad Religion's most popular songs is still Punk Rock Song which is still incredibly relevent. And punk? Still definitely exists in this form. 

That's hardly comparable to hipsters, who as far as I know never had any political ideology to wearing beanies and listening to the Front Bottoms and playing Wonderwall on the campus lawn with a mediocre acoustic guitar. :B"

But what you did say that I liked was that voidpunk *is* a social commentary and if we're really doing it in a way that challenges hegemonic humanity then we *are* gonna piss people off. *Thats* the kinda reassurance I was hoping to get from other people inside the voidpunk community. That I'm not the only one pissing people off by saying all this. 

I'd honestly be really upset if everyone decided that voidpunk isnt *really* punk or a movement and actually just an aesthetic thing (and I dont think that'll happen) because this *is* an idea worth exploring and using as a legitimate protest. We shouldn't be scared to get real with it, because the oppression that makes us feel dehumanized enough to have voidpunk exist in the first place is not afraid to be real with us."
voidpunk,fkxci0r,t1_fku2jkl,1584624994.0,">I don't think voidpunk is really that serious to be honest. I mean, there are almost no people who would find it useful to begin with

No people who would find it useful? I know a couple hundred people who find it useful. Ive watched this community grow from an empty tumblr tag with two posts about voidpunk to a thriving idea and set of *multiple community spaces* where people express the rejection of humanity in all kinds of ways.

As for ""not that serious,"" while it was never even intended to be more than a coping mechanism for a few friends, it grew into much more than that and will continue to grow now that the idea is out there. And the idea will change and grow, too. I believe Voidpunk has teeth. It's genuinely challenging something, or other people wouldn't feel threatened by it. 

To reduce it to a ""not that serious"" place for ""weird people who cant fit into the fancy serious groups"" is to ignore that it is serious. Not all the time for every person maybe, but this is a legitimate idea and didn't only come from Tumblr. The idea of species, including humanity, being a complicated and often political construct is found in academia as well. 

This idea has teeth and I don't think we should be downplaying that or trying to sweep it under a rug of #aesthetic. Aesthetic can sit alongside or even compliment a challenging idea.

Not poking holes to be mean, but just because this stood out to me and I wanted to give food for thoughts :P

Because of course if you look at my DNA and a human person's DNA we'd be the same. I admit to that physical reality, unfortunate as it is for me. But philosophically? Diogenes was challenging the notion of humanity with chickens long before any of us. :B and neither science nor philosophy can agree upon a definition for species or what a species is, so what does that say?
