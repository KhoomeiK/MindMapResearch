This movement between the spokes may only happen when you apply that extra pressure on the pedals, forcing thr wheel into a slightly more distorted shape before it flexes back and the friction between the spokes makes a creaking sound. Just spray/wipe some general bike lubricant inbetween the bits where the spokes touch on both wheels"
londoncycling,foheu1k,t3_g7gm0l,1587764760.0,"Yes the bus drivers are fairly forgiving.  Main risks in Brixton are 

1. pedestrians wandering out into the road without looking, usually pushing a pram first (always astonishes me)
2. potholes
3. cars/vans edging out into the road from side roads cos ur just a cyclist 
4. potholes

Best strategies are to stick near other cyclists in little clusters, practice the route a couple of times just to get the feel of it. You will get exponentially better each time you make the trip. You will learn where the potholes are, where the faster bits are, where the slower bits are, where pedestrians are. Best way to learn is to get out there and try it out."

NetflixBestOf,fkz18i7,t1_fkyy76u,1584660539.0,"Rewatched it dozens of times and read the book and watched the tv series and still discovering things. Confusion is partially the point, you are supposed to feel that smokey-cigarette-stained-beige-faded-drowsy-alcoholic-heated-weary-stuffyness clouding your understanding because that is what Smiley is feeling. Everyone is trying to lie or manipulate him.

The main theme of the film is the death of Truth. The film keeps referring back to the old times ""a real war, when men could be men"", and lamenting the current situation where ""NOTHING is real anymore"" and ""trust no one"". George Smiley and his assistants represent that old objective Truth investigating the new subjective ""truths"" of the new world. Cough- fake news Cough. Smiley and Co uncover the objective truth, but at great personal cost.

This is constantly represented in the film as chess - the game of sacrificing what you can to achieve victory. If you watch the film as Smile playing chess, and watch him making moves, almost knowingly stumbling into positions where he and his friends lose (SPOILERS ->! where Peter Guillam has to get rid of his boyfriend, where Smiley uncovers his wife's affair, where Ricky Tarr loses the love of his life, where Jim Prideux loses his best friend) !< it is easier to follow. You stop paying attention to exactly what Smiley is doing, and start paying attention to what he is trying to achieve and what he is sacrificing at the moment to get it.

Each scene, once Smiley starts investigating, think - what is the sacrifice here, what painful objective truth is Smiley uncovering for himself or those near him - and also, what knowledge is Smiley gaining from this. Then the moral question, do you think it was worth it?"

AskUK,fdn53r2,t3_em97kl,1578577529.0,"1. Financially - you aren't going to save much money making your own bread unless you have a large household. The additions of preservatives in supermarket bread will likely mean less waste, and they can just bake at such scale, its hard to match them on price.
2. Taste - your own bread will taste better. Whether that is because of fewer chemicals, or better baking, or just the psychological placebo boost you get from knowing you made it is, it doesn't matter to the neurons in your brain. Your bread will taste better.
3. Health - relatively small. Bread is bread - high in calories, low in nutrition. Some breads are marginally better, and your own bread may be marginally healthier than supermarket bread, particularly those with added sugar.
4. Your enjoyment - breadbaking is enjoyable in of itself as you say, its an interesting hobby with many avenues to explore, tangents into other areas of cooking and fermentation, particularly beer brewing. I can buy a loaf of bread from a supermarket, it may be a lot cheaper to buy than making my own, but I enjoy the process.
5. Social - other people get much more enjoyment from bread that you have made as well. If I buy bread from the supermarket and put it on the side at home, or in the kitchen at the office, people won't give a toss. But if I have a loaf I've baked myself, people are immediately interested, excited, sample one slice then have 3 more, ask questions, eat more of it, ask more questions, ask if I can bake more next week. Homemade bread brings them happiness and enjoyment too."

During his stints at NEw of the World and then Daily Mirror (one of the youngest editors ever I think), he did a lot of morally and legally questionable things.

\> Publishing pictures of a celebrity leaving an addiction clinic - breaching his own code of conduct.

\> Publishing an article saying a company was a good investment, then immediately investing in it. Two journalists went to jail over this, but he narrowly avoided it.

\> Knowingly published hoaxed pictures of British soldiers apparently committing abuse in Iraq. Refused to apologise for doing so.

\> Phone hacking scandal - papers Morgan was involved in were revealed to have hacked the phones of celebrities, murder victims families, pretty much everyone. Morgan denied ever being part of it, but his testimony was regarded as utterly unconvincing.

\> After Ian Hislop, editor of the Private Eve made fun of Morgan on a comedy panel show, Morgan sent his journalists on a years long campaign to harass Hislop at his house, going through his bins, going to his local church vicar to ask for gossip.

This all then mixed it with his ""flexible"" political stances, most of which seem to involve shitting on people who don't deserve it.  Sometimes the celebrities do deserve it. Mocking celebrities vanities and pretentions is a great thing. It's why everyone has such love for people like Trey Parker and Matt Stone. But with them, you get the sense that they are doing it because they really believe it. They would say it even if they weren't making any money and were still making paper card cartoons out of a friends basement. With Morgan, he is only saying it because there's profit in it.

He is an attention seeking self-promoter, a basic paparazi journalist who doesn't care about ethics, he is only looking for all the attention and clicks to be on him. Donald Trump even described him as  ""ruthless, arrogant, evil and obnoxious""  He has put a lot of work into redefining himself to be a bit more palatable, family friendly and a source of endless clickbait. Hence his GMB and Daily Mail opinion columns which often rage about family values and morals. But he hasn't become more moral, he has just realised that if he uses moral indignation, he gets more clicks.

Edit: Also, he thrives on controversy because that generates clicks from both sides. Petitions to sack him are encouraged and quite probably started by him. Piers Morgan To Be SACKED After Latest Article? Did He FINALLY Go TOO FAR? Click Here And Give Your View"

And therein lies your problem. You are interested in you think is correct. Not what voters think. I was proud to vote Labour in this election and glad to see my constituency held Labour. But I want a Labour government. And that relies on a media and corporate sector who are willing to give that government a chance. That means a modern Labour party who will compromise, develop intelligent PR strategies and keep a view to pragmaticism over principle. Do you think Dominic Cummings worries about what is objectively true? Do you think he scores potential messages with how good for the economy they will actually be? He is concerned with what people think and what people want. Any that is why he wins votes. That is the new reality, I don't like that reality, but I accept that is the new reality and I want a Labour Party that can fight on that playing field. 

In the meantime, I look forward to 5 years of Tory rule and Brexit. Thanks Momentum. Hopefully Labour can get its act together in time to at least keep London Mayor."
unitedkingdom,farjbh5,t1_farh5lc,1576316696.0,"I said ""cements the view"" that it is Stalinist. That is a widely held view of the party, and one the party and Momentum failed to effectively challenge. Blair absolutely courted the media. He gave them exclusive stories what they wanted in return for favourable coverage. He gave them positive narratives that could be sold. His government economics around PFI were awful, no denying that. But we are talking about how to win an election, not how to govern. 

Tories are playing flat out to win elections, and Labour needs to match that otherwise we will have 20-25 years of austerity. Corbyn and Momentum's postion appears to that they would rather have foodbanks, a points based immigration system and all the other evils of the Tories than feel that they have compromised on their principles. They need to change or get out of the way."

Blaming the media and corporations just cements the view that the party has become Stalinist in terms of information control, internal propaganda and being anti-business. Courting the media and corporations is a vital part of political compromise. Blair understood that and Blair was the last labour leader to win an election. Every single Labour canvasser I'm friends with dismissed Blairites and the Lib Dems as ""obsessed only with winning"", but as soon as Labour doesn't win, those same canvassers are completely devastated. You can't stop Johnson or Farage from minority opposition. You need to win, and to win you need to compromise.

Corbyn/Momentum's lack of compromise, lack of political pragmaticism, and complete focus on building a manifesto they were proud of rather than a manifesto that could win is what caused the worst election result since 1935."

When in reality, the problems faced by women are just different.

actual real-life women are less bothered about the ""how do I convince someone to fuck me"" problem, and more concerned with the problems of ""how do I make sure he's a good guy, someone who won't hurt me, won't pressure me into things I don't want to do,  maybe even someone who might want to hang out with me afterwards"". Incels whine about women gatekeeping sex, but men gatekeep safety and commitment.

Women may receive more attention and compliments, but those can also be damaging (boys get told they can be anything they want to be, girls get told they are pretty, guess how that affects career aspirations). Compliments and attention can also be very threatening if you are a woman getting ""complimented"" by a random guy in the street or on the bus. That kind of attention really affects how women get around urban areas, and how they use public facilities.

Just because you think you are being polite, does not mean you are being polite. Politeness can be active or passive, it can involve saying something or saying nothing, and quite a lot of the time, the actually polite considerate thing to do is to leave the person alone.

What is actually happening nowadays is a load of people are (still) being fucking rude and horrible towards women, but are being called out on it, but are then refusing to accept they are being rude and horrible to women and using the whole thing as an opportunity to be even more rude and horrible to women. You know that Seymour Skinner joke from the Simpsons? ""Am I so out of touch? No, it is the children who are wrong"" - the same but this time its waaay nastier and ends with women getting shouted at, abused, beaten up, killed, all because some thumbsucking fuckwit like Eliot Rodger lacks the humility to accept they may be in the wrong.

Politeness is still definitely a thing, and it is very distinct from flirting. It is just that some people seem resolutely stuck in this bullshit idea that THEY get to decide whether or not what THEY do to other people is polite or not.

As if comedians get to decide whether or not a joke is funny, or a politician gets to decide whether or not their speech was inspiring, or an artist gets to decide if their art is beautiful, you do not get to define how others interpret what you do."

Spending 5k on anything is a major life decision, and doing it without even notifying your significant other beforehand is rude. It tells them their opinion doesn't matter in your major life decisions. It tells them that if they disagree with you on a decision, they just won't be consulted. All of which undermines their position in the relationship, and undermines their capacity to trust you.

OP is using Reddit's love for dogs to cover himself for being an asshole. He could have taken 1 minute to have a call, explain his view, listen to her view and if she disagreed, say well look it's really important to me, I will spend the money on the dog, but I understand your concerns and I'll try and find ways of making up the savings before the wedding - live more frugally for a while etc etc."

All serious tho, focusing on the positives, what does she do that makes you think she might like you?"
HowDoIRespondToThis,ev9524y,t3_cit53w,1564306510.0,"1. Go to sleep, you are drunk. Don't drunk text your crush, love is difficult enough without being at 1% brainpower.
2. I don't think she is consciously rejecting you. If someone asks you out and you don't want to, it feels very awkward, too awkward to be immediately sending them long voice messages about other stuff.  That just seems distracted.
3. But unfortunately as part of this distractedness, it doesn't sound like she is particularly into you. If she was, she would have picked up on and addressed the remark directly. There is a chance that she is just batting it away because she doesn't think you are being serious (because you are texting her at midnight whilst drunk...).
4. If when you wake up and you still want to try again, try again, but be prepared for her to say no, or avoid the topic or in some way not reciprocate enthusiasm for the idea to try to communicate ""no"" politely. You will need to accept it then and move on."

AskCulinary,etf8iwt,t3_cbg8t5,1562763380.0,"Maybe something happened to the olive oil? Maybe went rancid or something similar to the below:

  [https://www.summertomato.com/the-bitter-truth-about-olive-oil](https://www.summertomato.com/the-bitter-truth-about-olive-oil) 

""According to *Cook’s Illustrated*, extra-virgin olive oil is the only kind of oil susceptible to becoming bitter. Even pure olive oil can handle blending better than the extra-virgin kind. The reason is because extra-virgin olive oil contains a high percentage of molecular compounds called **polyphenols** (thought to be cancer-fighters), which are normally coated in fatty acids. Under standard conditions, the fatty acids in the oil prevent polyphenols from dispersing in an aqueous environment. This is because oil and water do not mix.

When these fat molecules are broken into droplets in an emulsion, however, the polyphenols are distributed into the solution and their bitter taste can become apparent. When the emulsion is only lightly blended, the bitterness is not perceptible. But a blender or food processor breaks the droplets down into smaller sizes, increasing polyphenol dispersal. These suspended polyphenols can ruin an otherwise delicious recipe."""

Extract: "" In the past few weeks, on three separate occasions, I have met three different women who for years (one for more than 30 years) volunteered for the Samaritans. All three have now quit. One, Sarah Anderson, said: ‘Chad Varah \[the founder\] must be spinning in his grave.’ The Samaritans has changed, they say. It still provides a vital service, being the only 24/7 helpline for potential suicides or other desperate people — but it’s become a one-number call-centre, where the call goes to the next available volunteer, probably hundreds of miles away. Face-to-face conversations are now rare, and they’ve given up their old ‘absolute confidentiality’ policy. Sarah has set up a new counselling service called The Listening Place, which refuses to share information with the authorities. This means that the NHS cannot fund the organisation, but even so 400 volunteers have supported more than 2,000 people, many suicidal. Every one of them was contacted within 24 hours of being referred (usually by A&E, by their GP or by other charities), and were seen within a week, in person, by a volunteer dedicated to them. Really impressive.""

&#x200B;

So the criticisms Prue  Leith has is that the Samaritans is now more of a call-based than a face to face organisation. They've given up their old ""absolute confidentiality"", so now they can release information if 1. a caller directly asks them to; or 2. if a court order requires them to; 3. they receive a call about an act of terrorism; or 4. the safety of its volunteers or the delivery of its service is threatened.  - See more at: [https://www.civilsociety.co.uk/news/coroner-criticises-samaritans-over-confidentiality-policy.html#sthash.2Q45hJoP.dpuf](https://www.civilsociety.co.uk/news/coroner-criticises-samaritans-over-confidentiality-policy.html#sthash.2Q45hJoP.dpuf)

Again, this doesn't provide any evidence for your criticisms of them treating men in sexist ways, or being overly controlling."
SuicideWatch,eso8e1c,t1_eso6el0,1562162143.0,"I'm obviously not a Samaritans employee. I asked you to improve your criticism of the Samaritans. Many people on this subreddit come here to learn from each other's experience and someone may make a decision to call or not to call based on what they read here.  

If you are going to criticise a helpline (Samaritans or any other), that's great. People definitely should know if there are flaws or problematic services to watch out for. But it would be irresponsible to make criticisms you can't back up. You may encourage someone not to call when actually they should. Err on the side of safety. 

 You've given one source that shows the Founder Chad Varah splitting off from the Samaritans in 2004 because the organisation was moving on to a government-funded business model. That is absolutely fine. 

But that link isn't evidence of any of your other more eye-catching claims which I think OP \[ [/u/spacecatbiscuits](https://www.reddit.com/user/spacecatbiscuits) \] was asking about? These claims here:

* *The Samaritans in the UK are famous for \[virtue signaling\] and during office hours they have a whole hoard of board ladies who use their association with the Samaritans to appear Nice and Caring.* 
* *Male callers are often treated in very sexist ways and it's juts not safe for men in distress to go near these busy body daylight types who are very controlling and often abusive*
* *That callers point out they are unable to put it into world is met with petulance and phones being put down*
* *Samaritans are also overly reliant on certain supposed experts who's theorising and advice is based in debunked social theory that blames males for not being females.* 
* *The Samaritans also have zero interest in study and investigation, published in the last five years, that shoes massive gendered differences between man and women in suicidal ideation and action.* 
* *Other organisations are up to speed and helping those in distress and need. Thay are forcing a shift in understanding and evidence based action. Samaritans are off on their own little merry way and frankly are a last resort.*"
