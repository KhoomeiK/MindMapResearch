AskMen,fifrc03,t3_f7rlwn,1582392522.0,"She rubs my back almost every night. One of her favorite ways to relax in the evening is to sit on the couch while I lay my head in her lap, and we watch tv together. I take my shirt off and she just casually rubs her hands on my back and neck. I'm fully addicted to it."
Anxiety,fg19l54,t3_ewbhpn,1580423249.0,Ugh. I have to remind myself this exact thing like a hundred times a day. I clench my jaw so much that I started getting headaches if I don't catch it.

I'm 30 now and I'm still fighting tooth and nail to eradicate the damage that cult has done. I'm sorry you don't have the support you need, as a teenager. Keep your head up. I doubt you live anywhere near me, but you can dm me if you ever need a person to vent to, that understands that cult."
Conservative,f7gf3lh,t1_f7geinp,1573702095.0,These are absolutely impeachment hearings. They passed the motion two weeks ago on impeachment and exactly how to proceed with it.
wholesomememes,f7a7fv1,t3_dux55e,1573522336.0,"This is a tough post for me. Not only because my father is absolute garbage, drugs addict, alcoholic, but also because he died a couple months ago. He can never come back from it or be a better person/father/grandfather to my unborn children. Reading these comments and seeing so many other that also have so much pain caused by their father just breaks my heart. I'm so sorry to see how many people have pain like this. 

I wish I could take it away from all of you."

The past few years have shattered my concept of the United States. I used to be proud of being American, now I'm deeply ashamed."

Anxiety,eynnx89,t3_cxtvys,1567254059.0,"I did the exact see thing man. I made up excuses not to take mine for months (Paxil). About three weeks ago, I finally got the courage to take it and I'm so glad I did. I've had very minor side effects, and definitely nothing that has changed my ability to function during my day. Just try it out man, it'll be ok."
