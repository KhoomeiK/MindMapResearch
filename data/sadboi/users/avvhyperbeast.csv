OnePlus3T,eqdfps5,t1_eqctur0,1559988535.0,Oh I thought of getting dbrand grip but it's not purchasable anymore. Using Kapaver Back Cover Case it's fits well . Hope you have a skin as it can put some marks on the metal other than that it's a great case.

OnePlus3T,eq52k6l,t3_bx1qzn,1559791559.0,"This is from reading OnePlus forums and this is what I found.

People are having bugs,lags apps crashing from flashing and also from via zip from oxygen updater on stock Roms too . Also some people going back to Oreo due to lags. (Both 3 and 3T devices having bugs).

It safe to say better wait for OTA. Mostly any one I know didn't get the update via OTA.

May be they stopped rolling it out because of bugs (Can't confirm no news about it) . It has been a week since update launch news. 

I thought of posting this then I felt may be later. If you facing any lags in Oreo go wipe cache in recovery. Also backup data before any update to Pie."

OnePlus3T,epyjqw9,t3_bvw002,1559638880.0,"If you are buying a phone only for camera then OnePlus is not the phone for you. The camera is good and all but it is not the best out there. 

Other options are available."

OnePlus3T,epf3fou,t3_bubiq3,1559190590.0,"There is no other way I had done this too . I replaced the screen too. I didn't lose any data as there was no damage in any other components of the phone. You can do a checkup at the service center.

If your phone is password protected they probably call you back to the store after replacing the screen to unlock it and do further checkups.

Even going to recovery mode asks for password so probably data will be safe (50-50 chance) if there is no complaints in other parts.

You have to pay up front 90-100 USD (7400 INR) around to get this done. They don't guarantee that you will get the data back though."
OnePlus3T,ep636rv,t3_bthsou,1559064056.0,"Just replace the screen at the service center if your are not looking to buy a new phone . I dropped the OnePlus 3T and had replaced it.
There are no more software updates for the OnePlus 3 and 3T again .you can replace screen at use for 1 or 2 years.
All depends on how much you are willing to spend and there is no other work around."
OnePlus3T,eopbr6z,t3_brl2qm,1558759766.0,is it possible to change the accent color to anything else other than the ones in the default list ? (didn't see them mentioned anywhere).
