Yes I notice she is inexperienced (she is not my first psychologist) but I see her growing.  

I'm also a young professional but most of the time I know more than persons that works for a longer time than I do. So that is why I give her a chance. Also what I have noticed with older psychologist are that most are to reliable to there experience and that is why they make mistakes.

Think about dementia as well and stool incontinence (don't think lightly about those things). As well as the mental health af the person think about anger issue's (tantrums) over nothing and becoming very bitter as a person.

My mother has ms for 28 years now and I'm 24 . I have ptsd, depression, panic disorder and personality disorder because of what happened to me as a child because of the ms from my mother. Her behaviour gave to much stress on the family. And she was always angry (being angry is something a lot of ms patients have in common) and always yelling at me and my sister. We always had to be quite because she was tired etc.

When I was reading that you both want children the first thing I thought was please don't! Don't take children if you think the ms is bad now trust me it will become worse as well as the behaviour she already have. I wish my parents didn't take children even if that means I was never born. Don't take children just because you want them. Think about the future and how much it can damages them. 

Maybe not what you want to hear but as a child of a mother with ms I want to warn you for what will come and that it isn't a place for children to grow up.

Really gave me some new insight on the situation. For example: ""Sometimes therapist think they hit a gold mine with how they could help you and it’s irritating when someone turns it down. Which could be a possibility for your therapist behavior. "" never thought about it that way.

Thank you for your advice on how to act. Acting how I feel at that moment is maybe the best thing to do, hope that I won't regret it later.

She did nothing of that sort. So that is not the problem. I never really talk about being suicidal anymore because it doesn't really matter.

I didn't want to read a book she suggested. I never told her ""no"" or didn't do homework. She asked me why I didn't want to read it and I told her my reason (I think asking ""why"" is normal) but than she told me why she thinks I should read it. Again I told her that I didn't want to and again explained why and again she told me that I have to read it. She did this for almost a hour. I had a panic attack and was shaking. She told me she saw I had a lot of stress and that my behaviour (saying ""no"") wasn't helping me. 

She always tells me I can tell her if I don't want something during our sessions but the first time I did she didn't let me and really crosses my boundaries. It wasn't just a bad comment she made she did this for almost a hour (I was watching the clock)

The next session I confronted her and asked her why she did it. She told me that it wasn't  her intention to let me read the book if I didn't want to. I asked why she was trying to convince me for almost a hour and she told me she didn't noticed she was doing that. Than she told me that she only wanted to know why I did say ""no"" for the first time and why I became so stressed during the session. But now she looks back and admitted that she didn't handled well and that in the future  she must not do it like this anymore.

Edit: the problem for me is: she always told me that I could say ""no"" during the sessions but when I did it for the first time she didn't let me. I don't believe her words anymore. I want to I really do but something in me tells me that I shouldn't so she can't hurt me again.

- No, a panic attack once in a while doesn't mean you have a mental illness.

- It can happen again. Most people are afraid for it what will trigger it. The best way to deal with it is to experience it. You will learn that even when it feels bad that nothing bad will happen to you.

therapy,f8f2kzu,t3_e0mc4v,1574537512.0,"If your therapist is good you are paying him/her to help/ guide you to get better. If you need talk therapy your therapist will do that with you, if you need EMDR your therapist will less talk with you and do the EMDR etc.

It depends on what you need at the moment."
therapy,f8c3a10,t1_f8bg15m,1574451437.0,">Ugh. That all sounds sort of bleak, but that’s the way I see it. And it’s okay for me. I couldn’t work with someone who seemed overly invested or emotionally attached...I would know how fake that was and it would irritate me. Let’s just be real.

Thanks for your response. I agree with what you are saying. How more someone will try to over do it, will only makes irritated because of how fake it is."

I haven't really talked about it to my therapist. But I thinks she knows that I keep a certain distance. Maybe in the future I will discuss it."
mentalhealth,f87pgwh,t3_dzie5l,1574339434.0,"Can be something you learned from adults. Like I wasn't allowed to show emotions because it was weak. So if I did I got punished. 

And now I'm older I don't see the point in crying anymore because it doesn't make me feel better, I only hate myself more for it. 

Can have a lot of reasons but hope those two examples help you to figure it out."
therapy,f87fxcx,t3_dzgo28,1574331340.0,"This is not how therapy is supposed to be. It sounds like he was offended and acted like a child to be honest. I only have had females as therapist so the gender thing I don't know. I have had older and young ones that were really bad but also older en young ones that were good. The only thing that I notice with younger therapist is that they really holding on to say thing as ""that must have been hard for you"" "" I understand that must be hard"" some people like it, but it makes me feel uncomfortable.

Like in every profession you have good and bad therapists,  sounds like you have a childish one. 

Good luck and hope you feel better soon"
mentalhealth,f8630j0,t1_f85zhi6,1574288715.0,"It sounds like you have a hard time. If you can, seek help for it. Help can be talking to close people who you trust, a therapist, talking to people on the internet.

Also I recommend you to look for ""good""or ""healthy"" coping mechanisms, to prevent self harming in the future."
mentalhealth,f85xq2x,t3_dz8cyg,1574285512.0,"It is self harm. 
It sounds that your stress level was so high you had no other coping mechanism than harm yourself. 
Most of the time it is not that particular stress spike that makes you do it. But that you are on a lot of stress for a very long period of time.

It doesn't mean you will do it again, but if you not work on the stress another stress spike can make you do it again."

Hope things get better soon for you :)"
mentalhealth,f7zjsju,t3_dy92hb,1574111747.0,Where I live a psychologist can diagnose you but the have to do a extra course of 3 years. So they have a extra title behind there name. But I don't know how it is in other countries.
mentalhealth,f7xma0a,t3_dxytqy,1574063771.0,"In sorry to hear al of that.
I guess that I'm every profession you people how are good and ones that are bad in it.

Also I think whit finding a therapist it is important that they have they are specialised in what you need.

It must be hard to have lost so much money for nothing.

Hope you feel better soon!"
therapy,f7xle1k,t3_dxzx8h,1574062573.0,"I'm sorry to hear that from you sister and friend.

You can always try therapy and if you are feeling that it doesn't work than stop?

Hope you feel better soon:)"
mentalhealth,f7vjv8t,t1_f7vgnca,1574024352.0,"Don't worry about what to say a therapist should help you with that. Also you can just say what you just typed. I don't say that therapy always helps but it is worth trying :).

I have noticed that coping mechanisms are a really personal thing. For me mediating doesn't help at all, writing and drawing just distract me for a while but when I'm done I feel really bad again, showering and laying in bed until the spike of stress is over works the best for me. But it is really something you need to learn and practice. I relapsed with self harm because it is still hard for me to implement those ""good"" coping mechanisms. 

Some examples:
Exercise
Writing/ singing/ dancing/ etc
Taking a shower
Meditating 
Laying in bed (for calming down)
Watching a movie
Going on the internet
Going for a walk
Talking to someone (doesn't have to be hard stuff also can be shallow stuff)
Breathing exercises

You can surge on the internet for more examples.

Sorry for the long post but I hope there is something in it for you that helps :)"

A therapist can help you with both things.

I self harm as well and know how hard it is to not give in. Try to stay strong and seek help for it.

Hope you feel better soon!"

therapy,f7srd3j,t3_dxmdeo,1573997461.0,"Well, where I life therapist first talk to you so the can diagnose you and know what the problem is. You have to do some tests to give them a incide about what kind of thought you have etc. 

After that the will start to work with you, for example I have to do exercises for Schema therapy at the moment. I'm not far enough to implementing those exercises out of the office from my therapist. But that would be the next step and after that it would be EMDR. Trust me it is hard working and not only talking.

Of course it depends on why you are there for, but it give you a idea about what could happen.

Hope it helps and that you feel better soon"
therapy,f7rybyq,t3_dxl4xj,1573988791.0,"Well there must be a reason you are seeing a psychologist, so why don't talk about that reason?

Also I don't know or there at kid's living in the same house but it can be traumatizing for them or she can hurt them.

Good luck with everything!"
therapy,f7rd99l,t3_dxjunh,1573979235.0,"I disagree with that. Some people don't know how to find help or can't afford help. Also sometimes you want to do things that make you feel better but it only makes you feeling worse. Or everything is so overwhelming that you don't now how to start or how to help yourself.

What I mean is that it isn't that black and white :) 
 
I hope you feel better soon!"

But I'm also diagnosed with depression, panic disorder, ptsd and I have been abused for over 18 years (the abuse is what probably caused the disorder) so in my case I have enough shit that got me crazy in the first place haha. And for the therapy it doesn't change much for now, maybe in the future it will change the form of therapy."
mentalhealth,f7p20qp,t1_f7p0hdc,1573940115.0,Yeah I think that as well. On the other side the diagnose doesn't change anything about how things are because I already had the disorder without knowing (hope you understand what I mean). Hope people will awnser your questions :)
