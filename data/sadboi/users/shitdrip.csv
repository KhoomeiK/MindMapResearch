Colorguard,ev2qtw8,t3_ci9ck1,1564182113.0,"One of my close friends is trans(ftm) and managed in a guard of entirely cis females for three years in high school. I went to a private school, where they were pretty strict on traditional ""only girls do guard"" (which doesn't even make sense if you look at actual history?? anyway) he had to wear makeup, go into the girl's locker room and changing room, everything that us cis girls had to do. the only saving grace was that our guard instructor was super nice and managed to get unisex uniforms for all of us. I know he dealt with a lot of dysphoria from being grouped with girls all the time, but that didn't stop him from being one of the best performers out on the field.

People will probably misgender you, considering that a lot of people are just assholes. However, if you can look past that, I'd seriously encourage you to still march! Especially if the guard you're in is supportive, it shouldn't be too bad. message me if you have any other questions, i'd love to help :)"

thank you so much for your kind words. i'll do much better today to take care of myself and to be kind to myself :)"

I'm headed into my freshman year and my parents are still helping me pay for college, but I know that it'll quickly devolve into them manipulating me by holding it over my head. The same thing happened to both of my brothers, so I need to be financially independent asap. There's no way for me to communicate through FAFSA how complicated an unstable my relationship with my parents is, and it's fucked. It just leaves me feeling hopeless and lost :/"

Now I'm just nauseous most days, and I throw up like once a month. Only problem is now when I get sick, it's not just a one and done thing. It's really brutal and sometimes I can't breathe, which is terrifying. 0/10, would not recommend."

It's just out of spite. After that, I have no clue. But I'm in a position now where I have a few other things that make life worth living, so I guess I'll just chill out here. I mean, I'll experience death eventually, I might as well try to experience more of life as well. 
I always find it easier to appreciate something after you don't get access to it for awhile, but you can't really do that with life, although I wish you could. Just die, for like a month or so. This wasn't really an answer, just kind of incoherent rambling. oops"

I'm really sorry this happened to you, no doctor that doesn't ask consent before any kind of examination really shouldn't be out in the field. Especially something that you have to shove down somebody's throat. If someone has gone through sexual assault or rape, then it might end up triggering them reminding them of the incident. That's really, really shitty. If I could, and you were okay with it, I would hug you so hard right now. <3"

raisedbynarcissists,eok4sut,t3_bs3gpg,1558647148.0,"**mentions self-harm and suicide**

absolutely. I never went to my N parents much growing up, but when my brother threatened to kill himself, and they did nothing about it, I realised how much they really don't care. A few years ago, I was self-harming a lot, and my parents eventually found my fresh cuts. Instead of asking me about what they could do to help me, putting me inpatient, or literally just asking why, they lectured me for about two hours on how i'm just too lazy come up with an actual solution to my problems, and that this is all my fault that I feel this way. It's been about four and a half years since then, and I still have yet to hear anyone in this family ask anyone else ""how are you?"" or ""how was your day?"" even simple things like that aren't acceptable."
