I live in Egypt where supply of second hand is close to none, and dealers are either commercial crap or way out of budget (I'll include an album of what I've seen later).

I listened to a bunch of speakers when travelling and was going to buy something on that trip but corona happened.

Among the things I heard were:
Speakers:
Legacy (2 models)
Audiophysic? (3+ models) (Aesthetically and sound not pleasing.
Magnepans (1.7i & 3.7i ) Thought the bass was lacking a bit but quite pleasant. Ear fatigue minimal. But perhaps lacking a bit of punch?
B&W (A lot of models) but the one I loved was the 30k Euro one. 

I like speakers with very big soundstage. I assume I prefer to be surrounded by sound. 

I own a pair of JBL Xti100 which I find to be leaning toward home theater in nature, perhaps too much bass. The last pair of speakers I bought was a shooting star of a buy, a pair of Polk RTA12C which I gifted my brother. They're fantastic."

I've been trying to do research for at least 8 months now. And personally I'm fed up because I just want to pull the trigger and get my first pure stereo setup. 

Need to invest in:
A power amp
A dac
A preamp

And a good quality stereo pair of speakers

If I had the other Tannoy speaker (SGM 10B) I'd be happy. Unfortunately, I can't find the other pair. Most likely stolen.

This post is supposed to ask you:
 What do you look for in a speaker?
 Bookshelf or Tower (assuming medium sized room)

3 way or 4 way?
Super Emit tweeter or Horn?  
Magnepan or Box? 

So many options have made my mind numb and given me a big headache. 

Then comes the brand names. 
What brand is authentic, and what is commercial crap? What brands charge 40%+ just for their name alone?
