SuicideWatch,fattgd7,t3_ealq8m,1576341420.0,This world does suck. I’m sorry you’re away from your family and native home. Wishing you peace
SuicideWatch,fats4st,t3_eakgqn,1576341112.0,Sounds like you have an awesome sibling and significant other. I see you as trans. The LGBTQ+ community is pretty great. I suggest looking for support there. We don’t choose who our family is. If your mom is not supporting you then she shouldn’t get the privilege of being in your life. Wishing you peace.
SuicideWatch,fatmbyu,t3_ealazq,1576339592.0,I’m glad you shared your story. Sounds like you’ve been through a lot but you’re strong and made it through. Wishing peace and happiness for you.

proplifting,eu88e63,t1_eu869no,1563551882.0,It might be in FAQ? I just took some succulent leaves and put them on top of soil and two weeks later BAM. Not sure if that was helpful but it’s honestly still an unknown magic to me
