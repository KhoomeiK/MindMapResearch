It's really great to see him grow past his insecurities and establish himself as his own person. The dynamic is also very interesting if you don't bring him to the deep roads and he becomes a templar. But even when you have him in the party, before he's had a chance to grow, I think he's immensely funny and, as you said, he's charming in a sense. It's nice to see that kind of awkwardness, it's nice to see pettiness and sniping in a companion, because it happens all the time that your companions love you just because you're you."
