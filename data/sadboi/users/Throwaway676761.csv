astrology,ff1nlcd,t1_ff1m7cx,1579482161.0,It’s from Astro-charts.com! I just googled it. Same here I’d love to know his aspects. He was terrified of doctors when he was little and his school bullies forced him to go to the doctors and look at a skeleton display. After that incident he got really into human anatomy. I feel like his fear could be from a past life but I’m just guessing. Unfortunately we don’t have his birth time.

relationship_advice,fbbrxw6,t3_ecgg7a,1576706789.0,"To be honest, I’d be shocked if they haven’t slept together already. If they haven’t already no matter what he’s EMOTIONALLY CHEATING on you. That’s still cheating no matter what. That shows what type of partner he is and what type of husband he will be in the future. I know a lot of people will say “dump his ass” but seriously... I know it’s a tough decision since you’re engaged but he obviously doesn’t care about your feelings and is putting another girl’s feelings over his own fiancé for god sake. After you break up in a couple months he’ll come crawling back too. Men cheat because they usually want something new and exciting. He’s being an asshole and obviously doesn’t care about you."

Honestly I get sad when someone buys me something I don’t want / need and they know this. It makes me feel like they don’t care or think about me. It seems like your boyfriend bought this for your reaction and to satisfy himself. Maybe his love language is gift giving? Anyways, you can still not like a present and not be an asshole. Gifts should be meaningful and say “hey I thought of you and I know you would like this” not “oh I bought this because it’s cute”. long story short, NTA"

relationship_advice,ezfqkvm,t3_d0zl35,1567881802.0,"“Separation anxiety” aka codependency. Your boyfriend needs professional help! You’re doing too much for him. There’s a difference between supporting your partner vs being his mother/therapist, which unfortunately you are doing. Girl you need to make him get a therapist or leave. I know that’s harsh but this sounds extremely unhealthy. I know he’s going through mental health issues but you can’t sacrifice yourself for him. This is obviously  so stressful. Don’t feel guilty/pity to stay in this relationship if you don’t want to. You have mental health problems too that you struggle with. You have your own life. He needs to help himself. I’ve been through the same thing with a boyfriend before and I stayed for a year but I couldn’t any longer because it became emotionally abusive. You’re not responsible for his emotions... he is. This doesn’t sound like a relationship anymore. If you don’t want to stay, you don’t have to. Please don’t stay in a relationship out of pity. That’s really unhealthy. If you want to PM me you can (I have some experience about this - you can totally rant to me if you’d like)"

bipolar,eyrcige,t1_eyr63a7,1567365132.0,I didn’t really get any side effects besides some weight loss. It really helped with my depression. It changed my life! I definitely recommend it. I struggled with my creativity for a while but I learned new ways to express myself.

bipolar,eyr4y8s,t3_cyc9lo,1567360883.0,"Unfortunately yes.,, but that being said it’s still inside of us. We just have to pull it out now. If you’re a creative person you’re still creative. When you’re more stable you need to figure out how to bring out your creativity differently. Try to find different things that make you feel inspired. Listen to music, go on a hike, meditate, maybe force yourself to draw a picture/write a song within 1 hour and see how it turns out! Best of luck"

bipolar,ey4v0up,t3_cvldz5,1566809585.0,For me it’s really easy to stay up even if I’m tired. After 1am my brain gets weirdly active and it becomes sooo difficult to fall asleep.

Don’t isolate yourself with this creep. Cut him off. I read in the comments they work together??? That’s even worst. Girl, your boyfriend is a creep and taking advantage of you. They’re peers. Of course she’s going to be upset. Sometimes parents don’t know the best for their child but in this situation she does. Please let go of him. You’re young and will find someone better!

sex,exvr2lw,t1_exvpz95,1566604879.0,"I’ve been in similar situations to you. I use to pretend I liked it or I would just close my eyes until it was over with. I really don’t feel that comfortable with partners now because I’m afraid of telling them what I want and I’ve only had negative experiences. It’s better for you in the long run to hold some boundaries if you’re not feeling up to it. Masturbation could help you discover what you like too! Sex shouldn’t feel like you’re cracking under the pressure at all. If you don’t want to do it , please don’t. Even if you want to make him happy. Sex isn’t everything in a relationship and you deserve to be sexually satisfied too. I’m so sorry you’re going through this. You don’t deserve to feel this way. The best way to experiment with masturbation (imo) is just set a good mood, and just touch around your androgynous zones.. see where it feels good and doesn’t. (Btw I’m 21F so if u want to private message me u can since I feel like I’ve been in the same boat)"
sex,exvpk2s,t3_culw1r,1566604068.0,"just so clarify you started dating your boyfriend when he was 25 and you were 16? I’m not so good at math but that’s creepy. No wonder why he doesn’t care about your pleasure in bed! Try to masturbate by yourself. I recommend just trying on your clit and see where that takes you. I never had an orgasm with a man either. I can only do it with my clit, sometimes with my vagina but rarely. I’m sorry you’re experiencing this. Your age difference is honestly inappropriate and it’s even worse you feel like you have to get it over with. If you don’t want to have sex you don’t have to! It’s your body your choice!"

bipolar2,exgv96h,t1_exg8xd3,1566276765.0,Yeah bipolar is so much more complicated than just on and off. I think it needs to be discussed more because it is a complicated diagnosis but people stigmatize it as this simple “happy then sad” BS. like girl I wish it was that simple!!

Yeah it sucks feeling like the odd one out but at least we’re an individual. I’m trying to push myself to love being “out of the box” rather than trying to fit in. The more I try to act normal, the more weird I become. We just gotta be ourselves and learn not to care. Once were 70 years old we’re gonna look back and go “why the hell did I care so much?”.

Ask your therapist about your meds or the next time you’re at the doctor. I know this might be sketchy but next time don’t swallow your pills and look them up online.

I also have ice pick acne scars while the rest of my family has perfectly clear skin. I’m totally there with you. It sucks feeling this way. Personally I try to just face my fears. Ok so I’m ugly? Yeah the world is just gonna have to deal with it. Fuck y’all. I try to have this attitude but it’s still really really hard and it’s the beginning summer. I know this is a super triggering time.
