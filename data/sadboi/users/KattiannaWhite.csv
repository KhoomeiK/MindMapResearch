If I was in your place she could consider herself already single, because that type of shit isn't something you do, not even as a joke.

O melhor a se fazer é informar melhor, ver que tipos de sintomas ela tem, e tentar conectar e ter uma breve ideia do que poderia ser, e assim que estabelecerem que de facto existe um problema relacionado com o que falei, ou qualquer outra condição (pode não ser BP.) Será mais fácil comunicar isso a um especialista e facilitar o diagnostico deles. 

E se ela for a um psiquiatra o meu conselho é: FALE SEMPRE O QUE SENTE, TUDO. Tudo a pormenor, eles sabem o que fazem, eles estudaram para estar ali. E eles sabem reconhecer padrões e sintomas melhor que nós mesmos. 

Ouça sempre o seu médico, sempre. 

E nem toda a medicação vai funcionar, muitas vezes é sempre um tiro no escuro, mas quando achar ""a tal"" que pra mim por exemplo foi Quietapina, tudo vai dar certo. Mesmo que de inicio não pareça."

Eu só consegui viver uma vida normal quando comecei a ser medicada. (350mg Quietapina). Estes sentimentos eram tão gigantes que eu ás vezes só queria morrer, e quando a pessoa chega a esse ponto não há nada a fazer porque a loucura fala mais alto. 

Eu só estava a sabotar o meu relacionamento, explodindo com a pessoa que eu amo e falando coisas que eu não quero por causa desses sintomas. 

Melhor levá-la a ter ajuda enquanto ainda dá tempo, porque isso é uma doença crônica e pessoas com esse padrão precisam de ajuda e medicação pra sempre. 

Se ela de facto sofre de bipolaridade, fale com ela, procure ajuda, porque isso MATA a sério. E só piora com a idade. Os casos de suicídio de pessoas que não são medicadas com essa condição é exorbitante."

But it's all about understanding,
If he were to take everything I say in my outbursts seriously, my relationship wouldn't last this long. You're right, no one is forced to stay, no one is forced to endure this. But for some of us... We fight so hard to make the person we love happy. At least I know I am. And everytime I think that I may be making him unhappy I always think I'd be best for him to just leave me. I try my best to make him see that. But he loves me, and I love him. And we're constantly trying to make it work. No one should assault or make someone feel like shit. But if you're aware of their symptoms you can't blame them completely either. We can't generalize every situation, because if we do none of us would be worthy of love..."

No entanto as vezes eu desejaria que ele me deixasse, assim como todos os meus amigos também. Porque eu me sinto um monstro. Não tenho controlo no que digo, acabo por falar coisas muito ruins sem eu querer. E eu sei que isso afeta as pessoas á minha volta. Ninguém nunca fica muito tempo, a não ser os meus  amigos e a pessoa que eu amo especificamente. Às vezes alguém te tratar mal, por causa de doenças mentais, não é porque a pessoa quer.
