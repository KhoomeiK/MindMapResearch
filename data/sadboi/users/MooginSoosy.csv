depression,fmp9qf8,t3_fwmiwk,1586277012.0,"I (27F) relate to this so much. When I initially started feeling terrible I worked hard to reach out to people. I was doing decently for a while, but now I'm just back to feeling worthless. I feel like I can't do my job right and that I'm gonna get fired soon. Working from home is slowly driving me crazy. I thought I could handle it, and at first I could, but now it's so difficult. I have to keep putting on a happy face so I don't worry my family but I'm so tired of it. I don't even know who I am because I tried so hard for so long to always be the person i thought other people wanted me to be. I want to crawl in a hole and sleep until everyone forgets I exist.

I hope your antidepressants start to work soon. Or that you can talk to your doctor and try different ones. I personally am starting to think i have ADHD or something and maybe I've been taking the wrong meds and that's why I feel like absolute garbage. I'm so so tired of existing. Idk.

I hope you start to feel better. I really really do."

All I want to do is crawl in a hole and never come out. I hate myself for making my mom worry so much. It's not fair to her that I can't get my shit together. Everyone always says it comes in waves, but it's so different to actually be in the downswing. It's awful...

Hoping for us both to get an upswing soon"

depression,f9wy41r,t3_e7anxu,1575701063.0,I hurt myself all the time to punish myself. I've got scars all over my knees from scratching until the skin breaks. I punch myself to leave bruises. I recently cut myself for the first time. All because I feel like I deserve to be hurting more than I am. Like my physical pain needs to match my emotional pain.

Anxiety,f985xz2,t3_e45wza,1575174323.0,"I definitely do! It's led to me being a huge people pleaser so people won't get mad at me in the first place. I also avoid conflicts whenever I can. I steer away from conversations that could lead to arguments as well. It's definitely not healthy, and I'm trying to work through it! 27 years of this behavior is really hard to work through."

depression,f6m2a9i,t1_f6m0au7,1572965494.0,I definitely needed to hear this!! I've been having a lot of thoughts that I'm faking it and I shouldn't even be on medication because I'm making it all up. Going to a psychiatrist today for the first time as well as therapy so I'll bring this up with them.
depression,f6lzz1n,t3_drzfce,1572964416.0,"I think you're already doing a great job!! I would say keep up that communication. I often feel like I'm a burden to my friends/family/fiancee and hold my feelings in. Sometimes I wish people would sit down and just ask questions. I have a really hard time opening up and will only offer up the smallest bit of information, hoping that someone will want more and ask for more. 

Keep finding things to do together, especially active things!! I find my depression/anxiety practically vanishes when I'm doing something active, but it's so hard for me to find the motivation to get moving. I have to keep signing up for things that I would feel guilty for not going to (examples being soccer, aerial silks class). 

Make sure you take care of yourself too! Take time to do things you enjoy on your own or with your friends, and practice self care. These should be things everyone does for themselves, even people that have a positive outlook on life. I wish the best for you and your boyfriend!"

I've been getting help recently because it got worse, and now that I'm starting to feel a little better my brain is trying to trick me into saying ""I'm better now, I don't need help"" when oh man, I really really do. One of the things that is helping me is the realization that no one is the same when it comes to mental illness. Everyone experiences it differently but that doesn't make it less valid."
depression,f2pldk5,t3_ddxq0x,1570345739.0,"This is EXACTLY how I feel. I brought up these feelings to my doctor and therapist and they ended up increasing my medication.

Luckily the meds are helping and I'm feeling more numb, but it's really scary to have those thoughts. I'm glad I'm not alone with these feelings too.

AmItheAsshole,ewe4wng,t3_cnmro6,1565314576.0,"NTA - I went through something similar. Since my parents lived in the same town we would do some weeknights at my mom's, some at my dad's, and switch every weekend. It was a really stressful time in my life, especially when my parents remarried. I was around the same age as you with a step sister around the same age, and I was miserable. I decided to not go over to my dad's anymore before my senior year.

I think the important thing for you to do is talk to your dad and explain how stressful it is on you. It's easier to live where you have everything in the same place especially as you become more active in school/sports. I told my dad we could get lunch once a month instead because I still wanted to see him. We're both bad at communicating and with various anxieties we grew apart, but have been working harder to rebuild our relationship (I'm 27 now).

Your dad needs to understand that it isn't anything personal. It's about your mental health and where you feel most comfortable. It's not an easy conversation to have, and he still might not understand right away. It's better to get all your thoughts out now so he can think about the things you feel. Good luck!"
