Him staying in a war torn country to care for his family, bouncing back in the olympics after getting bullied for no reason, and then joining the bulls and putting his ego aside to become essentially a perfect fit in their system.

This is the issue with this debate.  Anybody who doesnt agree with you doesnt care about American deaths.  As I stated earlier, people are going to die from this virus regardless of what we do.   The only way that number goes up is if we overrun healthcare systems and more people die because of it.  If we dont get to that point then literally nothing will affect how many people die, it will just spread those deaths over a longer time.  Get off your moral high ground.  I know it makes you feel better and convinces you that nobody else could possibly be right, but try to look past it.

The fundamental misunderstanding that you are falling victim to is that flattening the curve means cases are going down.  That’s not what it means.  It means that the peak of the curve is underneath the healthcare capacity line.  So we could still see rising cases but as long as the eventual peak is underneath capacity, no extra deaths will happen.  The issue of course is projecting that is very hard to do.  But on that same note, you cant just look at cases increasing and say for certain that the curve has not been flattened.  The curve *has* flattened and that’s undebatable.  What is debatable is if it has flattened enough.  If it has, then we can start opening up.  Again, even if that leads to increase in cases in the short run, as long as the peak isnt spiked, no extra deaths will occur.

All of it is projections and lets be real neither I nor you are anywhere near knowledgeable enough to speak authoritatively on it.  My issue is when people speak about the curve but dont understand what they are talking about."

There are two things going on here.  First, is the history of blacks owning guns as related to the jump start of gun control in this country.  Second, and more important to today’s day and age, is the *enforcement* of the law.

Unless we find a vaccine, those are the realities. Its also undebatable that we have flattened the curve.  

What we need to look at is if we can incrementally open up certain aspects of the economy while still keeping the curve flat enough and thus underneath our healthcare capacity.

In base 10 we have digits 1-10.  In base 60 they have digits 1-60 (which is shown in the picture).  What is confusing is they do use a sub-base of 10 to create those original 1-60 digits. However after that the places use a base 60.  So we have the ones, tens, hundreds, thousands place and so on.  They have ones, sixties, three hundred sixties, two hundred sixteen thousands place and so on.  In other words base ten places are 1, 10, 10^2, 10^3 and so on.   Their base 60 places are 1, 60, 60^2, 60^3.  As you can see it allows them to count high a lot faster.

Like I cant understand how a 5 year old can have that much balance and produce that much torque."
