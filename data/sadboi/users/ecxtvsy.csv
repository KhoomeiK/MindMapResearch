ptsd,ewn3lar,t3_cozfh9,1565567609.0,"if you would like to read a book, id recommend you to read “You Can Heal Your Life” by Louise L. Hay, and to buy the exercise book, not an easy book to work on but definitely worth it, i dont know bout you but i would want in my life to feel loved and to give love but i thought i didnt have that to offer so i wouldnt receive it either (or at least thats what i thought cuz i unsubconsciously thought i wasnt worth of it) and i understand what you’ve been through, you have to heal first hun its hard but not impossible, you are never going to find peace if you dont work through it but that is of course if you want to actually heal, send u all my best wishes, god bless you✨"

selfimprovement,ewn2f6m,t3_cowy12,1565566729.0,"“You Can Heal Your Life” by Louise L. Hay, omg that book is so special to me and i actually have it near my heart, it changed my whole life. i used to suffer from depression so every little thing in my life that i wouldnt like would turn into a whirlwind and i felt miserable, yes i would have times where i was happy but soon id be down again for whatever reason and that book came to me in the right time and im very grateful for it, it makes you see life from a different perspective like for example i went from the victim character to the person in control of my own life, now i think that every problem comes from not loving nor accepting yourself enough cause when you do it dudeeee you’re unstoppable!!! best wishes ✨"
depression,ewn1mmn,t3_cp1ajy,1565566128.0,"i used to feel like that too, but it stopped after i started accepting and loving myself for exactly the person i am, im going to tell you is not an easy and quick road but when you make it its full of peace and joy!!! i dont have to please or act a certain way for someone to like me anymore, i’m just me and if someone doesnt like me its his choice and its normal, not everyone is going to like us just like we dont like certain people for whatever reason, when you stop giving fucks for external acceptance your life changes. remember this the only validation we need is the one that comes within ourselves."
