unpopularopinion,ewvz60s,t1_ewu6z5g,1565817031.0,Popular
Christian,ewvs5ae,t3_cpgu69,1565812805.0,Sure. That makes sense to me but I still don’t understand how you know you have it since it doesn’t talk
Christian,ewvd76s,t1_ewvczhg,1565803854.0,It’s ok. I shouldn’t have gotten upset. I was judgy too. How do you know if you have the Holy Spirit or not? How do you know if it’s just your conscience? These I have always wondered. Yes ofc I can pray for you.
Christian,ewvc85s,t1_ewucntp,1565803264.0,"That is a lot to unload. First of I am trying to be upset or angry or judge of you right now. I know I will be judged as I judge you and if I am angry at you that’s as bad as murder. Sorry if this comes off rude, I’m trying not to be. But the way you wrote this rubbed me the wrong way. Yes I will say I am a Christian, but every Christian can go through hard times, struggle with fleshy things, and every Christian has the right to ask questions. How can you judge me a wonder whether I’m a Christian or not. In my post I asked if certain things were bad. Yes, God is the ultimate joy, but I think that everyone is tempted with sinly, worldly things. I am a Christian that has been struggling with heir faith
And I was simply asking a question. I do not read the Bible as much as I should. I’m sorry if I come off as rude, but it made me frusturated when you questioned if I was a Christian because I think everyone has temptations and questions. Yes I do need to read my bible instead of watching/listening to worldly things. Thank you."

Christian,ewph6k6,t1_ewpgpiw,1565641100.0,"I think I will try to seek God more. So to be clear, should I stop listening/ watching the things I mentioned? I feel that I should prob bc I am feeling guilty which is the HS, but I so badly want to watch/ listen. Then I feel bad about it? Are there any books in the Bible that talk about strength? Cause I don’t think I can stop listening/watching."
Christian,ewpfm0t,t1_ewpctr9,1565640134.0,"Yeah. Is it bad I yearn for a boyfriend? Someone to love me, someone to not feel alone? Someone who can help me grow and I can help grow? I feel like I lustfully want a boyfriend and I know it’s wrong but it’s hard not to. Especially since I am so lonely. So I do feel guilty watching certain shows and listening to slcertain  songs so should I stop watching/listening to those? It’s so hard not to bc their popular among my friends and are really good shows/songs. Do you know post Malone’s song candy paint? That is a song I love singing to but it cusses. The songs I listen to aren’t completely rap. How do I get over lustfully wanting a fulfilling, validating boyfriend? If I feel guilty about listening to this music and watching these shows I should probably stop watching/ listening but it’s so har. How do I give it up? I don’t know if I have the strength/‘power to."

Christian,ewpc36q,t1_ewpaelx,1565637962.0,"Also is it a sin to cuss, twerk, smoke, and do drugs? I have never seen it in the Bible listed as a sin/ but I’m just curious."
Christian,ewpby96,t1_ewpaelx,1565637876.0,Well when I watch the tv shows I do think/ wonder if it’s bad. I feel a bit guilty. I know that the sex stuff in movies isn’t like porn but I kinda feel guilty watching the tv show. A lot of the songs I listen to cuss and sometimes when I sing along I cuss as well. When I watch tv shows of people doing stuff lustfully I wish I had a boyfriend (but NOT TO DO THISE THINGS). Just as a companion and to wait till marriage. I feel guilty as I watch these shows and listen to the music but something in me just overrules my guilty feeling and I push it aside and watch/ listen more.

lonely,ewp35vx,t1_ewnsnwe,1565632449.0,Haha dogs are great!  Have you ever tried talking to your spouse? Maybe they feel the same? What do you mean your friends are your husbands?

lonely,ewnc4l1,t1_ewnc2u5,1565574212.0,I understand.
lonely,ewnbic7,t3_cp3mpn,1565573734.0,Unable to cry. Crying relieves your emotions. You have to suppress your feelings because you wouldn’t be able to let it out in a crying session.
lonely,ewnanr6,t3_cp3ujr,1565573069.0,You are amazing. And “weirdness” is what makes people different which is pretty cool.
lonely,ewnakyo,t3_cp3ujr,1565573010.0,Don’t.
lonely,ewnafwm,t3_courtv,1565572902.0,Me every day unfortunately.
Christian,ewmp1z7,t1_ewm3wat,1565557008.0,Thank you. It’s hard for me to not be in control and constantly want Gods will. I am gonna try to work on trusting him and knowing He has me. I also struggle with basing my faith on my emotions. Sometimes it’s hard when my emotions don’t line up with my facts. Like I KNOW God is good. But do I feel it all the time? no.
Christian,ewluozq,t1_ewl2n1i,1565536349.0,"What’s op mean? And I am a girl btw. So I am in my teens and I’ll say trusting and believing in God has been so hard for me lately.  I feel alone. I have “friends” but only like one actual friend. I don’t understand why I feel lonely or why I feel sad. I want to understand why He is letting me feel this way. And sometimes I question how good God is. Trusting and believing in God was never this hard when I was younger. And I’m going to be looking into colleges and stuff soon. I’m so stressed and anxious for that. My parents talk of me getting scholarships since I always get As and what if I don’t? Will they be disappointed? I want Him to relive my stress, loneliness, and anxiety for the future. I haven’t Heard him talk to me. But at the same time I don’t know what to listen for."
