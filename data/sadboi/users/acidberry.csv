The life I have now is the life I built to make me happy."

I live alone with my dog and no relatives in this country, it wasn't intentional but now  kind of glad I had it so I know that I can't die from it lmao"

For me life is so much better alone I get to do whatever I want whenever I want. I get to pursue any hobby or crazy interest I come out with, travel to places by myself meet new people, study more, eat whatever I want, work harder since I have nothing to worry about except my dog , I have a great life and I truly enjoy it. Once you are truly happy being single a relationship will just come and hey if it doesn't then thats great too"
