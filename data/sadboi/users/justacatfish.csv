ac_newhorizons,fr14i5v,t3_glrdfr,1589813093.0,Nice! I have the same island layout for my first island. I’m starting my island again too and hope to get another good layout again :)
Anxiety,fqhwuni,t1_fqhr1iv,1589385990.0,I have been doing the same thing and found it hard to go back to sleep. Haven’t found a good solution yet but getting the stress out through other ways has helped a bit.
WitchHatAtelier,fq5zut2,t3_gh0svq,1589121491.0,Welcome! Enjoy reading and prepare for the eventual waiting lol :P
Anxiety,fpsk0to,t3_gf0n8i,1588874771.0,That’s a super scary situation. It’s worse when you can’t be beside her but you are also doing your part by staying home. Do what feels right to let out your emotions out but also remember to keep on breathing and eating and taking care of yourself. You deserve it during such difficult times. Sending you love and support <3
Anxiety,fm5bel9,t3_ft3nko,1585769803.0,Thank you for the positive vibes. You are awesome!
toastme,flkarn9,t3_fp92fo,1585237361.0,Love it! I’m starting to see glasses more as fashion accessories now and you look great in this one!
Anxiety,flk6m18,t1_fljiy98,1585234988.0,This :( just knowing that there are so many people suffering right now makes me feel more stressed
toastme,fla6fgs,t1_fl9bolc,1584977633.0,Hey! Not sure if this is helpful for your case but I had a similar situation with my boyfriend. I was telling him that I want to spend more time together and it just felt like he was not getting it. What ended up working was taking to him about love languages and understanding what both of us feel appreciated by. “My love language is quality time” is harder to forget than “I want you to pay attention to me” because it is more about why you need that in a relationship.
toastme,fkhybkm,t3_fiakrd,1584208263.0,Just wanted to say that you are amazing! So proud of your hard work and determination! I know you can do anything you set your mind to. We are here to support and root for you.

Anxiety,fkg43b9,t3_fi6351,1584149448.0,Wow this really resonated with me. Your sister is amazing with words! I hope she’ll write and share more with us.
toastme,fk9jazf,t3_fgyjwu,1583977186.0,"Wow, when I first scrolled past this I thought you were female! Love how supportive your friends are. Your curly hair is so cute and the make up looks natural too."

depression_help,fjnixdi,t3_fe2trd,1583508383.0,"I looked through your other post as well and it does sound really tough :( You have the stresses of school, relationships and health and that’s a lot to handle. Having gone through failed relationships and failed classes, I think the most important is still your health. You can recover from a broken heart with time and repeat classes. I had suicidal thoughts after a difficult break up but now I am still friends with my ex. I graduated 1 year later than planned. It sucks but no one cares now and everything turned out okay. I hope you can talk to a professional or someone you trust. There may be free resources that you can leverage at school or in the community to get you started."
toastme,fjnfugz,t3_fe6vb0,1583506441.0,My husband had a mass in his face. It turned out to be benign and the surgery to remove it was very smooth. I was definitely worried but everything turned out okay. I know each case is different but I just want you to know that you are not alone and there’s a good chance that everything will work out!
Cinderblock,fjm1js0,t3_fe1rj7,1583459456.0,Thank you. Unsubbed right away.
toastme,fj6sujt,t3_fbrrws,1583079422.0,Yay! Glad to see you pursue your dreams and work on something that you love. That takes guts and passion which will take you far!
Anxiety,fiwziba,t1_fiv38s9,1582808585.0,"Nice! Sounds like you have awesome friends :D 

It took a while to figure out which part of my identity I want to focus more on. Many people will go through this at a different stage in life. For me, it was when I first went to university in a different town. I was really homesick and wished that I had more of my family nearby like my other friends. I focused on the bad parts of my multicultural background and how I didn’t fit in “perfectly”.

However, there are also good sides to it. You get to take the best parts of different cultures and call it your own. You can use your  different backgrounds to relate to different types of people. Even at work, speaking more than one language can come in handy. Once I was able to face the downsides and appreciate the upsides, it felt like this was just part of who I am instead of a problem that I should be worried about. 

I currently identify as Chinese Canadian because I have a lot of Chinese values and I’m also grateful for all the opportunities of growing up in Canada. Sometimes I’ll bring up my experiences living in other countries as well if it helps me connect with someone new. I hope you can take your time and find the right answer for you. Feel free to message me if you have more questions."
Anxiety,fiuncw5,t1_fiukvi4,1582744688.0,"I think talking to people about it helped. Usually they will have 3 types of responses: “What, I’ve never noticed your accent!” or “Yeah, I hear it and it’s not that bad” or “I know! I’m also worried about my accent”. Their responses  made me realize that this is not a a big issue and I’m also not alone in this. Since you are sharing this here, I think you are already on the right track :)"
Anxiety,fiul3e0,t3_f9xqex,1582743450.0,"Put on you favorite study music and pick a few small topics to review first. Sometimes getting started is the hardest part. Remember to take breaks and get some sleep since it can help you remember and understand better. Also, it’s not going to be as bad as you thought. Good luck!"
Anxiety,fiuk5is,t3_f9xndm,1582742939.0,"I was born in China and left when I was 6. Although I’ve been living in English speaking countries for more than 20 years, I still have a bit of my Chinese accent. When I was anxious, it feels like my accent comes out more which makes me more self-conscious. However, as I got more comfortable with my cultural identity, I also realized that I’m focusing on my accent more than those around me. It’s not negatively affecting my work or family life, just something that makes me a bit different and that’s okay."
toastme,fi2d1fr,t3_f61kgw,1582076923.0,You are brave enough to overcome many challenges and share your experiences with others. You are resilient enough to make sense of those experiences and look back with a smile. There will be challenges again but I’m sure you can get through them and come out smiling again!

toastme,f9316fa,t3_e3gidf,1575047234.0,"First of all, I have to say your skin looks so radiant! Either you are an expert make up artist or your skin is just amazingly flawless! Love your eyes and hair and how everything looks together.

Secondly, you are balancing so many things it’s amazing! You are working hard to improve not just your life but also want to make things better for your loved ones. 

Last but not least, you are mindful of how you are doing as well. You are aware that you’ve been feeling tired and also taking on a lot. You are reaching out here to help with your day. By knowing when to ask for help, you’ll be even stronger with everyone’s support.

Here’s a toast to your beauty, determination and self awareness!"
toastme,f92zvos,t3_e3gqtj,1575046258.0,"Sorry the prank threw things off a bit. I’m sure it’s more of a reflection of your coworker than of you. 

You had a great start to that day and I’m sure you had other things you were looking forward to for the day. The prank sucked but it’s done now and the next unexpected thing to happen might be something awesome!"
toastme,f92yn8l,t3_e3g05w,1575045328.0,"Take the deepest breath you’ve taken all day with me.... in........ and slowly out.... 

You’ve gone through a lot of difficulties and you’ve done amazingly. You at a beach, have a stable job and have an amazing dog buddy. You are taking active steps to improve your life and cut out things that don’t serve you. You are so brave (and beautiful!) and things will get better because of your efforts. 

You don’t want to go to the beach right now? So what? Chill and watch some shows, take a nice bath and maybe go for a walk later. All these are great and there are many ways to still have a great holiday! Sending you lots of love <3"
toastme,f92xe9j,t3_e3fqtv,1575044374.0,I’m sorry you are going through a tough time right now. It might be hard but I know you can tell those voices that you are worth it and you will get through this stronger and better! You can do it and we are all cheering for you!!!

toastme,f7f2w38,t1_f7f0ed8,1573671247.0,I’m glad you can make it back for the funeral. There’s a saying in my culture that funerals are both sad and happy events. Sad because of who we have lost but happy because of the stronger bonds we will form with family through these tough times. Wishing you all the best!
toastme,f7f2hoe,t3_dvtmoq,1573670994.0,Understanding how you are feeling and trying to see the positive side means that you are already on the right path.

It was difficult at first but now I try to remember all the positive parts of her life and help her live on through my actions. Although I’m not religious, sometimes I dream about her and it feels like a part of her is still with me. I hope you’ll get to spend more time with family during holidays and get lots of love from them. It will get better!"
