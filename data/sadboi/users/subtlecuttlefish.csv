FemaleDatingStrategy,fqh9375,t3_gi0ddz,1589371492.0,"Honestly I just tend to rely on myself and my own judgement/ gut feeling because deep down you always know what's acceptable and it's that knowledge we need to learn to pay attention to. 

If I have a problem with my partner I would go and check in with myself to see how I was feeling and where the issue lies. Sometimes that's all I need to do and there's actions I need to take myself. Again you know this from your gut feel - when you are thinking it over and you wonder ""is this because I'm feeling lonely as I haven't seen my girlfriends in a while?"" and that gives you a feeling of recognition and understanding, you've hit on the root cause of the problem.

If the root cause is in the relationship, I'd then bring it up with my partner in a constructive way of ""so this is what I've noticed/am experiencing, how do we solve this problem?"" A HVM will be receptive to having this kind of discussion and you'll talk about it - even if you disagree you're still respectful and on the same team. Try and be as calm as possible (because it's no one else's responsibility but yours to manage your mood as an adult) but even if you're a bit emotional it won't derail the conversation as you're both actively working to understand and resolve. You'll come up with something together even if that something is reassurance or a mindset shift. Afterwards you should feel calm and like it's been resolved - and if there's any actions that you've agreed on which need to be taken as a result, your partner will follow up off their own steam/with very minimal prompting and absolutely no passive-aggressive behaviour. This builds confidence and trust in eachother. If it's a young relationship it's normal to feel hopeful but not entirely relaxed about it after the conversation alone because you haven't developed that trust yet, but once they consistently come through with their actions you should do.  

It's normal, healthy and necessary to have these kinds of conversations occasionally. You are two separate adults melding your lives and space together - how can you do that without discussion, telepathy?? If you are having them all the time then you are trying to change stuff that can't be changed and you're incompatible and should consider whether you will work together. If you are constantly having the same conversation but there is no follow-up, or if they shutdown the conversations or somehow see having a discussion as a threat to the relationship, then this person is not going to be a good partner.

I compare it to living with a new housemate. Imagine if before you moved in together, they refused to talk about what living together might look like because they aren't sure if it's going to happen or not. When you do move in you sit down together and make a rota for the chores but they never do their part or do it inconsistently or do it with such bad grace it creates a lot of weird feelings for what should be a shared responsibility. They stop paying rent and the landlord is threatening to kick you out, but when you try and bring it up they get defensive and yell at you - you still don't know why and the landlord is still needing the rent. No communication on their part leads to a bad living situation on yours.

Friends are fantastic for lifting you up, for being there for you during hard times. I also like seeing other friends in positive, healthy relationships and using them as role models. However I do think relationship problems should be resolved with your partner - and if you can't resolve it with them then you have learned this person isn't willing to communicate with you and they're not going to be a good partner because of it."

FemaleDatingStrategy,fq7brk2,t3_ggwek4,1589144342.0,"So here's my perspective as a bi woman:

There are a lot of misconceptions about being bisexual, such as people thinking we can't be monogamous (like we need one of each to be fulfilled or something) or that we're hypersexual or that we're secretly gay (for a straight partner)/ secretly straight (for a same sex partner). It's an added layer of difficulty when dating. Just because someone is bi does not mean these things are true any more for someone who is straight. That said I see a number of issues here:

Issue no. 1: He didn't tell you. Even though it sometimes gets me unwanted attention from men (omg you're bi, do you want a thresome??? Nah bro. If I wanted to disappoint two people at once, I'd just have dinner with my parents) and some lesbians will straight up not want to be with bi women because they think they will leave them for a man. I do try to drop that I'm bi into the convo with potential partners because it's important info about me even if it might put some people off. In fact, that's why it's important to bring it up - if it's a dealbreaker for someone, I need to find out sooner rather than later! If someone doesn't bring up important info that's an amber/red flag depending on the importance of the information. 

Issue no 2: Your attitude to gay sex - if someone was ""disgusted"" by the idea of me having had sex with women in the past I would steer clear of them as they will not like and accept me. I am LGBT - it's part of who I am and it's part of my dating history. I will still be bisexual even if I were happily committed to an opposite sex partner. That doesn't affect my ability to be a loving an committed partner but someone who is anti gay-sex is not going to be compatible with someone who is LGBT. 

Issue no 3: If you're not comfortable with the idea that he's had any kind of sexual relationships before because saving yourself for marriage is important to you, you're probably not compatible with him.

So him being bi in itself isn't a dealbreaker but all of the above things probably are."

UKPersonalFinance,fq707a4,t3_gh3fge,1589140091.0,"28 years old, female and living with parents just outside of N London. I moved back after I split with my long term partner of nearly 4 years in January. We were renting a place together near to where I worked. The split came as a shock and moving back in with family was definitely the right thing to do in terms of support and not being in the headspace to go househunting. Financially it also made a lot more sense - I was hoping to buy a house in the next two years with the ex but now that I'm on one income I will need to save all the money I can for a deposit and probably level up my career/move further afield to afford a mortgage alone. 

It was meant to be for a couple of years but then coronavirus happened and I lost my job as a junior software developer. So now the plan is to use the time to build up my portfolio and skills to get a new job in hopefully 4-6 months time or so. Not having to worry about rent and deplete my emergency fund is an absolute godsend at this time (as is living with others during lockdown). 

Was a bit of an adjustment after living independently for nearly a decade but fortunately it's gone fairly smoothly than I thought. To be frank it's not really where I saw myself being at 28 but I remind myself it could be a lot worse, everyone has had plans set back because of corona, and I'm working hard to climb out of it."

FemaleDatingStrategy,fpjmg8h,t3_gdr655,1588673986.0,"Girl, I was in a similar situation. I was with a guy for nearly 4 years. He was an amazing boyfriend for the two years and gave me no reason to feel anything other than lucky and happy. This is the guy I wanted to get married and have a family with - and moving in two years later, at age 27 I was right on track. When we moved in together things started to go South. Suddenly he wasn't looking at me the same way any more. He'd spend all his time on his phone but never had the time to answer jokes or texts I sent his way. He would hang out but it felt like he was going through the motions. He stopped wanting sex and our previously great sex life dwindled to once every couple of months and I just didn't seem to do it for him any more, which hurt. We're not dumb - we can just TELL when our partner is off, the look in his eyes is different, the energy is different and just like you I knew ""something has changed"". Of course I tried to fix it. He blamed job stress, depression, joint housework responsibilities, lack of time, ""the way I approached things"" and like a normal human being I trusted what he said to be true and tried to work on fixing the issues. But nothing I did made any difference. At this point my gut was screaming that something was wrong. Surprise surprise, I found out he was cheating on me just before New Year's when he accidentally left his phone out.

It's hard to walk away, it really is. And it stings on such a deep level because you think what did I do to change his behaviour towards me? This person got so close to me and saw all of me - and they did a thing like this. It sounds like he's playing into that narrative by telling you ""you deserved this"". 

Nobody ever, EVER deserves to get hit or cheated on. 

If you were the world's crappiest partner he would be well within his rights to walk away. But that's all anyone has the rights to do if they're not happy in a relationship - to leave, not cheat multiple times and put hands on their partner. 
The saying ""if he beats or cheats you need to leave"" is absolutely true. This guy has done both. These are just things you can never get back from. By cheating, my ex broke the relationship, he broke my trust, he broke what we had. The distance and disconnect is something that we could have worked on together. When he cheated on me he showed me that he was not an equal partner, he did not have the same level of love and respect I had for him. It hurt to accept it but I was on my own even when we were together.

I did walk away as soon as I found out (after taking a day by myself to think). And he cried and said all the things I wish he'd said before. I still walked because he'd shown me over and over how little he valued me and *I* valued me, I value me so much and I'm not taking another chance on someone who can lie to my face like that for months. But whether it's the first time or the third time he's done something, whether it has been a month or 6 years you've been together, whether he cried or smirks when you confront him, you win when you walk at any stage. Because you just won yourself back - the most valuable thing you can get.

I cried twice a day for a good couple of weeks. I've spent a lot of hours venting to friends and family and writing angry letters to him that I never sent. That is normal and all part of the grieving process. But I've also felt such relief, peace and happiness from my decision. I feel proud of myself, I feel like my heart grew a little bit - that even though someone I trusted with my heart abandoned me, *I* did not abandon me. I did right by me. It's like when you workout or make yourself study - you don't really want to but you do feel good about yourself afterwards. And you get that even if it's something you've been putting off a long time. But you gotta make the leap.

I just turned 28. It has been 5 months since the breakup and even with the current coronavirus craziness and resulting loss of a job I really enjoyed, things are still pretty good. I've been getting up early and working out and am slowly working on building my portfolio and interview skills up for when the market picks back up again. I live with my family now and my home is peaceful and calm and there's no tension or fights about housework or money - any issues get resolved calmly and don't hurt my relationships with them. And in March I tried online dating for the first time. I immediately got a lot of attention which was validating after the complete lack of it for a year. And it resulted in several matches and four high quality dates. Number 5 was the guy I've now been seeing exclusively for a month. I'm cautiously optimistic but I know even if it doesn't work out that a) there's actually a lot of compatible high quality people out there for me and b) I'm more content alone than in a relationship where I'm being disrespected. Your mileage may vary of course, but I'm telling you this whole story to show you what it could look like when you choose to leave a bad relationship and open yourself up to a different story."

I don't make blanket statements like ""I just think facial hair on guys is really unattractive"" to mixed groups of guys where some of them have some designer stubble and then get defensive when they point out they do, in fact, have some facial hair.

FemaleDatingStrategy,foueos8,t3_g97zi9,1588082627.0,"I used to be in a long distance relationship with a guy who lived a three hour train ride away. Both of us had very little money at the time so we alternated seeing each other every two weeks. Of course when he came over to mine I'd make sure there would be suitable food in the house - he had some severe allergies and was also a picky eater. I was on a very tight budget at the time as I was saving up for my masters, paying for driving lessons and the sport I do twice a week and renting a room & paying for food all on an entry level salary. I didn't have a lot of spare time either as I had a full time job. Yet somehow I always found the time and the money and I always got it done because my partner had just waited two weeks and travelled three hours to see me.  

I will never forget visiting him and he'd forgotten to get breakfast supplies in for me (despite not being employed at the time so it's not like he was busy). We walked to the local supermarket and I picked out some own-brand value jam to go on my toast. He made a fuss about buying it because he was broke. It was 27p. 

Ended up dumping him. We both started out as broke clueless grads but while I was working hard to level up he never did get the hang of planning, cleaning up after himself, or managing his finances. Even at 23 I knew I didn't have time for that 🤷🏻‍♀️"

FemaleDatingStrategy,fnvtto0,t3_g3opg6,1587304578.0,"This is so important. My ex partner of nearly four years was an amazing boyfriend for the first two. He was genuine, kind, attentive, thoughtful, made a lot of effort. We waited three months for sex and he was always respectful around it. He was consistently very supportive of me doing my masters degree and cheered me on during the tough times. He was there for me when my pet had to be put to sleep. He introduced me to his friends and family who I liked and got on with, and who welcomed me. He encouraged and celebrated my hobbies and achievements. Even though we had to be long distance for a year he drove 2.5 hours to see me most weekends and we facetimed nearly every night.  He had a career freelancing and seemed to be doing well out of it, was hard working and enterprising. Green flags all the way, not a red flag in sight, no bad gut feelings. 

It was only after we moved in together after two years that the red flags arose - I discovered that he wasn't doing any financial planning or budgeting. None. Sometimes that happens, not everyone has a great financial education. **But when I showed him how to budget and did some household food planning, he did not take it on board**.  

The living situation he was supposed to organise for us after my graduation was extremely shady and when I insisted we move out because of my safety concerns a couple of weeks later (and offered to pay the whole deposit and did all the legwork for finding a new place myself) **he got very defensive**. 

He would go along with things big and small that I suggested (a new pet, a trip to see my family, buying a type of alternative accommodation together) that **we had an open discussion about but then at the last moment (I'd already bought the tank, we were already in the car, we were already at the consultation) he tell me he wasn't actually comfortable about it!** You had every opportunity to raise this earlier??

And then over the course of the last year of living together **he gradually stopped responding to messages and funny things I sent him even though he was constantly on his phone. He stopped telling me sweet things. He stopped initiating sex. He stopped taking me out to places.** I believed him when he said he was depressed and struggling with worry after having had some freelance work fall through - and of course I tried to help and support him how I could/encouraged him to reach out to therapists, friends and family. But it didn't make any difference. **Most people have a bad day/week/month but decent people will take ownership of it and not let it dictate their mood and how they treat you for any longer than necessary.** 

**Then I discovered he was cheating 🤷🏻‍♀️.** Boy, bye.

This is why it's so, so important to not move in with someone without having your ""shit hits the fan plan"" in place. This is why it's important to have your emergency funds and to have a career, hobbies and a social network. I didn't think it would happen to me because I thought I could spot these guys coming a mile away, we had done everything right and the ONLY reason I wanted to live with him was that I had built up that love and trust over a long period of time (I could have afforded my own place if I'd needed to). The only reason I stuck around to work on it was that I believed him when he said the issues were communication, mental health and job worries. But if they're consistently not communicating and sorting their lives out like an adult and/or they do something shitty like cheat on you BELIEVE THE EVIDENCE OF YOUR OWN EYES. They're not ""having a bad time right now"", they've unfolded. Because people that have your best interests at heart DO NOT do these things and they don't suddenly start treating you badly because of external circumstances. Anyone can behave under perfect conditions - when things get a little hard for them, are they still as great?

Honestly? Ignore him and delete the request, yell PERMISSION DENIED, CLOWN BOY as you do it. Think of it like this: you know the little rush you get when someone you still have feelings for responds to you? Don't let him have it. Instead, let him have the feeling of disappointment and self doubt when he nonchalantly checks his Instagram and realises his request is still pending. He's not blocked, so he can't tell himself he meant soooo much to you you had to block him out of pain/anger. He's just not exciting enough to be acted upon. He's just not that special. 

You ARE that bad bitch, now take your small amount of satisfaction from rejecting him and go live your bad bitch life! Go do your #thriving, but do it for they eyes of you, your current friends and family and your future partner (who's going to be and upgrade in every damn way).

Anger,ffhyzp5,t3_etoz9b,1579959819.0,"Anger is a completely normal and healthy response to someone putting your child in an unsafe situation. No carseat??? That's BAD, your kid could be seriously injured or killed, that's not an overreaction! 

On feelings generally: you are allowed to be angry, sad, guilty, ashamed whatever response you feel even if it isn't proportionate/appropriate to a situation - feelings are just feelings. We can't control HOW we feel, but we can choose how to act and respond, which it sounds like you are doing very well. So please don't beat yourself up for feeling angry or one mistake you made in the past, and congratulate yourself instead on the great and mature job you are doing to handle it now. 

The only thing I would say is - consider what you're trying to achieve by telling him about your (valid) feelings. He didn't care about them before when you were together, he definitely won't care about them now, and it sounds like he's using what you're saying to mess with your mind. I'm three weeks post-breakup and I know it is sooo tempting to give a shitty ex a piece of your mind. But it's not our problem any more +that's why we left! You have no obligation to tell him anything about how you are thinking or feeling. Best thing is to keep things strictly factual around child care. Look up the ""grey rock method"", which is a good way of dealing with toxic people you still have to talk to. And expect an extinction burst of elevated behaviour when you stop reacting to him, as he will try to push buttons until he realises you're not budging. Don't stress if you slip up, you're only human, just put yourself back on the bandwagon. 

If you see your child is being put in danger, please seek legal advice and document that shit. Often it's a pattern of behaviour that leads to bad abuse/neglect, start gathering evidence now. 

If you feel he might be about to step up his attempts, it can't hurt to up your security (install cameras in your house and car, change/add locks, go over approved people for pick up at your child's nursery and who's allowed in at your place of work). You can bring photos

That is honestly one of my biggest fears - I used to work as a carer children with severe disabilities, and I have first hand experience of how hard that was and is something I thought about a lot. I'm honestly not sure what I'd do in that situation, but I know it would be really rough and I'd be looking at all the options including residential care at a young age, because I know having someone have that level of dependence on me 24/7 for the rest of my life is not something I could do. I'd still take the responsibility for advocating for them/ providing the good care, and treat them with all the kindness and patience in the world but I don't think I could be their daily carer. For higher functioning disabilities and physical disabilities I'd find it a lot easier to cope and I probably would find a way to live with that."

socialskills,fa4azoy,t3_e7fcbm,1575802791.0,"A lot of people have said some really helpful things in these comments on how to find more interesting things to talk about. This is all great advice, but my go-to when I'm struggling for something to say is to just ask questions and be interested in them. 1) People love talking about themselves. 2) Everyone has something that makes them light up. Even people who are a little bit shy have stuff they want to talk about (you know that first hand) and would be so grateful for the opportunity to talk about it. And even though their thing might not be your thing, asking questions can uncover common ground you have and just plain makes people feel good - and the positive feedback will in turn help you relax and be yourself/ make your more approachable to other potential friends watching the interaction.
It's also a lot easier to learn a few rules of asking good questions than building up interesting things to say. 
Obviously it's a balance - you can't just ask questions (just as you can't just tell entertaining stories) and if all you ever do is listen you're going to feel like they don't know you as a person. But while you're learning better conversation skills, it's a great fallback option when you can't think of anything to say and you're panicking."

He struggles to eat a large quantity of just one thing (mashed potato, rice) but if there's other things mixed in he can finish a lot more. I think if it's all the same your brain finds it boring/ repetitive and wants to stop faster. So we try an add stuff. I.e. mashed potato you can add chopped greens or left over meat or cheese, and if your feeling especially adventurous you can form into patties and lightly fry on both sides (British recipe called bubble and squeak). For rice you can add beans, ground beef/ Quorn mince, tomato sauce,l or make it into egg fried rice. Can also at around it with textures - we put walnuts and grated cheese on top of pasta bakes to give a crunchy crust on top of the soft pasta."

OP, it IS a big deal that someone cheated on you even if they were young, it was 3 years ago and it was once. And it's not ok for her to lie about it - best case scenario she didn't want her mistake from three years ago to ruin what she had now.

survivinginfidelity,f5w8eov,t3_dpe3vd,1572517250.0,"This reeks of attention seeking to me. The constant excuses as to why she can't provide proof are a big red flag, and as other posters have said, no doctor or test that I know of will confirm someone is ""one and a half weeks pregnant"" - if it's on a medical document, it's because the patient has self reported missed period and likely conception dates. 

Completely respect that you want to make your own decision so not going to give unwanted advice on what you should do re: staying in the relationship. But it's really important to point out that it's highly unfair on you that you've been so involved in all of this and the trickle of constant ""updates"" are not fair on your mental health (especially since you literally just found out if the cheating happened on 11 Oct???). 

She either is or isn't pregnant (which can be proved in a few weeks time). And if she is, it either is or isn't by your husband (which can only be proved after birth). That's all the facts you need to know. All the oooh-maybe-maybe not!!!! are not facts, they are damaging drama. Cut that shit off. 
I know it *feels* super urgent but it's good to remember that a person can't get any more pregnant and the die has already been cast on the paternity. Waiting a few hours/days/weeks to respond isn't going to change the truth. 

My advice - set up an email for the sole purpose of this. If she's got any news, she can send it there (she can set up her own separate email with the power of TECHNOLOGY!). Go through it once a week. If it's distressing to you, ask a good friend/relative to screen it and let you know if there's any actual proof yet. Do NOT respond to any calls or messages on any mediums outside of that (including getting passed on messages via third parties). Block her on everything. Make your friends aware of the situation and tell them not to pass on any messages. Until there's unfakeable proof (i.e. physical copy of an ultrasound with her name on it) then I'd assume there's no baby, and therefore no reason to contact you or your husband. 

Expect her to throw a massive shit fit. Expect her to ""need"" to talk to only your partner and refuse to talk to you. Expect her to try every medium including linked in or social media comments to try and contact you with realtime news of the most dramatic (unproved) pregnancy evvverrrr with sooooo many complications and medical anomalies and maybe miracles!!!! all of which need your/ your husband's immediate attention RIGHT NOW or maybe she'll harm herself and her (unproved) unborn BABY you MONSTER and it will be all your FAULT for not responding fast enough!!!!!!!!!!! 

Hold firm. No proof, no baby. 

If your husband doesn't get on board with the plan and contacts her outside the email thing (""but she neeeeeeds me! She is so young and sad and all alooooone, only I alone can save her, how could you be so cruuuuuel"") that gives you information on what his priorities are.  

Then give yourself the gift of sweet, sweet silence and space in which to process what the fuck just happened and your feelings and needs. Reach out to Team You (your friends, family, any counselling), take long walks, write it out, cry it out, scream it out. Whatever you need emotionally and practically. This was like 2 weeks ago????? You've had to deal with so much shit. Please dear God look after your own mental health and block out anything else."
