Recently however I‚Äôve had major issues with consistency, being uncontrollably impulsive, and feeling low energy. A lot of not so good stuff has happened recently to be a likely trigger but I‚Äôm very concerned more meds will turn me into a different person - which may be a good thing if this person is able to manage their moods better??

San JoseÃÅ is joining cities around the world for a day of protest opposing a new war in the Middle East!

On Saturday, January 25 we march from San Jose City Hall (4th and Santa Clara Streets) to the historic intersection at Story Road & King Road to rally against the illegal acts of militarism and harsh sanctions imposed by the U.S. administration.

Join us at the pre-march rally to amplify our voices and to learn about transit options for people who may not be able to march. 

For all who believe in peace, for all who are opposed to yet another catastrophic war, now is the time to take action!"
