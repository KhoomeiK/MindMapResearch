Like sometimes I'm fine but sometimes lights hurt me so bad, especially at night, that I have to close my eyes or turn enough on that there isn't the dark to light contrast. When my dog barks out of the blue it sends me into fight or flight. Loud, high pitched, repeated noises or kids screaming outside my door (apartment), all of it gets to me. Especially crowds, too. It sucks because if I'm being ignored that it bothers me it makes me angry and I snap at the person : / my dad doesn't always listen to me if someone's triggering my anxiety and tells me to get over it so I kind of snap at him a lot bc he knows how to triggerme, he and I went into a store and he for no reason kept repeating me name over and over again as I was already starting to become uberanxious because of the very crowded store we were in,and I snapped at him,he just got pissed at me and told him I made him look like an asshole after repeated times asking.

I just recently tried to get back into the community and made some posts talking about random dumb shit and because of me being pansexual, I was told my sexuality is dehumanizing, disgusting, told to kill myself,blah blah blah. It's so depressing that the one community that's supposed to support and understand me the most is the most hateful towards me. I've always wanted to go to pride fest and all this other shit, but I cannot for the life of me support the one community that's supposed to support me, and refuses.
