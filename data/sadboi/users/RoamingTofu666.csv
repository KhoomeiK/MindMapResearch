To prepare for that seminar I had intended to read Allen Wood’s Intro to Kant, Sebastian Gardner’s Guide to the Critique, and Kant’s Prolegomena to any future metaphysics. I hope, by the end of the seminar, to be sufficiently prepared to tackl the other two critiques on my own.

pcgaming,fpe5x6n,t3_gbc2eq,1588540995.0," Hello,

Within the last two days I've been having problems playing online FPS games. I play a lot of TF2, and my laptop has (prior to this problem starting) always run it perfectly. But lately I'll join a game, and within 5 minutes I get disconnected. However, during the time that I am in the match everything runs smoothly. It's only after playing for a little bit that I get disconnected from the match. I decided to see whether it was an issue with the game or something else, so I booted up PUBG and the same thing happened. I would join a match and be fine for a few minutes, and then I'd get kicked out. Steam and all of my games are up to date. I don't think it's my internet connection that is the problem for the following reasons:

\- I can browse the internet, stream videos, download stuff, just fine, with the usual speed and quality I am accustomed to

\- My friend, who I live with, is able to play all of her videogames (MMORPGs, mainly) without this issue happening to her. We usually play videogames at around the same time, once both of us are done with work for the day and are relaxing in the evening, and prior to this issue that's been messing with me, we've never had problems w/ the internet getting weakened by both of us playing at the same time.

Does anyone have any tips? Has this happened to any of you before?

THank you, all."

Thank you for your response. Let me try to better articulate my points.

&#x200B;

In T [1.4.2.7](https://1.4.2.7), Hume writes the following: ""Since all actions and sensations of the mind are known to us by consciousness, they must necessarily appear in every particular what they are, and be what they appear"". I read this passage as implying that what Hume describes in ""Of the Influencing Motives of the Will"" shouldn't be possible. If it is so that we know the nature of all of our sensations, then how is it that we can confuse calm passions as not being passions at all? 

&#x200B;

With that in mind, I was reading Hume's writing on custom from the *Treatise*, in which he states that repitition can facilitate a particular conception of an object. As such, I was curious whether or not Hume would say that the reason why the confusion between calm passions and reason is possible is due to a custom (spurred by the dominant depiction of reason as being in conflict with the passions, which is what I assume is really the picture Hume targets in ""Of the Influencing Motives of the Will"") that had people repetitively conceiving of the calm passions as instants in which reason combated forceful passions."

&#x200B;

All I am hoping for is that professors can expect at least a little bit less from students during this time than they usually would. In situations like this, it is difficult to concentrate on and appreciate the knowledge that we get from our classes, irregardless of the amount of 'self-discipline' one might muster. When society is thrown into such a state of disarray, and when loved ones (and you!) may be in peril, studying for a statistics test or writing a lit. paper simply has to take the back seat.

*The Decameron* by Giovanni Boccacio. It's possibly the funniest book I've ever read. It's about some privileged members of society who hole up in a fancy countryside villa in order to wait out a pandemic that's wrecking Europe. They pass the time by telling humorous stories that are often erotic, satirical, and critical of society.

&#x200B;

*The Heart is a Lonely Hunter* by Carson McCullers. Very profound book written by the author when she was quite a young woman. It's a novel with moral and political implications that may be more pertinent to our current day then when it was originally published, which I believe was close to a hundred years ago at this point.
