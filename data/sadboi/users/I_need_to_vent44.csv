I feel like you can see the great paradox of creating a comedy vs tragedy/something edgy. If you create a light comedy (Graviyt Falls), you will inevitably end up with something heavy that usually ends with an apocalypse. If you plan to create something that sounds heavy or edgy (Rick and Morty, because come on if your whole cast is dysfunctional like that it does sound pretty heavy), you will inevitably end up with something extremely silly. It's just how it is. But like as far as I know R&M was always meant to just be silly. It's a bit sad sometimes tho because god I'd sell my soul for another continuation of the evil Morty arc. Like pls, pls I need it.

I've never been someone to stand out, sometimes by choice, sometimes by ""too depressed to put on anything else than the first thing that falls out of the closet"". I just don't, I don't have the energy nor motivation to put on something nice. I'm like a slime. Spineless and always being able to blend in. I hate standing out in any way, I hate when people look my way, I hate when they notice me. I feel weak and vulnerable, perfectly aware of all my imperfections and the fact that I'll never be as beautiful as them and in those moments, I'm sure that they are aware of my thoughts. Standing out is a dangerous thing.. You never know if it's good or bad, if you're gonna be the one beaten up and mocked. I just don't do that. I want to blend in and just be...invisible, I guess? To have all the standard opinions and agree with everything somebody says. Standing out is dangerous. Disagreeing is dangerous. It's dangerous to be yourself, whoever that person is. To show opinions, style, to talk a certain way, move a certain way, be a certain way. I could never do that. I could never stand out. The mere thought makes my skin crawl and my eyes water. The thought of people looking at me, of perceiving me as ""different"", ""defective"", ""broken"", ""a machine"". I can't do that. I am me only when I am alone. Only then I sometimes, when I'm feeling shitty, put on something I find cool, and then I lounge in it around the house and I feel like the me I was never allowed to be. I feel like a person who can have opinions and taste and a favourite colour, I feel handsome and confident. But I'd never ever be that way around other people. I blend in, I make sure I do.


&nbsp;


Also, most people who dress the way they do literally...don't think that. You know they could think the same thing about you, right? Like they just...fucking dress the same way you do every day, the fuck is your problem? Do you, every morning while dressing up, think ""I am an individual, artistic, free thinker who's breaking the mold""? Like you just fucking dress up dude, it's not that hard. You think people who like chains or always dress in pastel colours don't just fucking dress up and go? And surprise! Most of those people actually HATE attention and don't want it! That's like...a thing I can prove to you. All the people I've ever met or talked with, they hate when people stare or look at them. A good chunk of those people straight up have social anxiety. It's even very prominent in the cosplay community. If you talk to cosplayers, you'll find out that a good percent are scared of the attention, they're shy, they don't want the attention, they'd feel better if somebody else wore their costume for them, they'd basically rather just create the costume and have someone more confident wear it. Most people, in general, seriously fucking hate attention from strangers. Like the majority of humans straight up feels nervous, ashamed or afraid when strangers look their way for too long. That's like, a thing. The other part, they don't, usually it's either zero shits about what other thing (learned behaviour) or very high self-esteem (innate, mostly). Like seriously you absolute embodiment of prejudice, people just wanna live their lives just like you. There's nothing deep about it. People just like certain colours, styles, fashions, and it doesn't make them any better or worse. Some girls like pink, so what? Some girls dress in all black because they like it, so what? Some guys like to keep their hair long, some go out in casual clothes and others always wear suits, so what? None of them want to be stared at, and all of them just want to live their lives without idiots whose brains were apparently infested by cordyceps thinking the same shit about them as elementary school kids do about the kids who don't fit in."

Within a year, Carter was fast-tracked into Yale's advanced neuroscience programme, really a front for the CIA."" Here it literally says that he was transferred to the government front while he still WAS in high-school. That means that if the cabin was an assignment (and in that case there's no reason for the govt to come in there with guns and shit and arrest him???), he could have been any age but probably somewhere from 17 to 30."
LeaksByDaylight,fmepk0l,t1_fmec7wf,1586010556.0,"The Archives. The scene we got retconned literally all the lore. Like...all of it. It's like they forgot what they wrote as his backstory. A) he has no business doing experiments in some forest cabin since the government recruited him and he started doing experiments for them. B) if he had business in some cabin, he would need to be like 18 at most since the lore says that he was recruited after high-school or at the start of university (can't remember rn). C) the government has no business busting him in the cabin because they recruited him for a college program, not busted him and persuaded him to work for them. D) the experiments in the cabin are too gruesome, the lore says that he started with small experiments but his superior encouraged him to be merciless and so Herman started doing more and more ruthless stuff. E) he literally wasn't supposed to be doing whatever the fuck he was doing in the cabin and if he had been the government wouldn't have recruited him in the first place since that was not what they were after. He just got out of hand but nobody dared to say anything.



Should I go on or?"
LeaksByDaylight,fmcxlmw,t3_fub7nh,1585954891.0,I just hope that they won't retcon Anna's story. I don't trust the devs much after that weird Herman thing and somehow I think they wouldn't retcon Legion but absolutely would retcon Anna for whatever reason.

badwomensanatomy,fmcvnj9,t1_fmcc19u,1585953744.0,"Fast metabolism. Some people do have it. My childhood friend has serious problems with it because she just doesn't gain weight no matter how much she eats and it's causing her to be underweight. She eats like a wolf but still nothing. They're trying to make her drink some protein shakes to make it better. Some people just have this condition. It's a gift, I guess, until it isn't."

You couldn't predict where tf the traps will be, this guy just turned off his brain and placed them completely randomly. I didn't notice that in the first minute or two so I was like ""Why are all my teammates getting caught in traps? Are they all goddamn dumb?"" aaaaand then I stepped on a trap."
