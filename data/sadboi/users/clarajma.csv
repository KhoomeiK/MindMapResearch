StopSelfHarm,fnsa65w,t3_g3gu5g,1587216953.0,"It’s okay! You made it sooooo long and that’s something to be so proud of, your not back to the start because you have already made it 331 days before and I think you can go for a whole year next time, and don’t be discouraged if you don’t, I just hope you try to stay clean again💛💛💛"
selfharm,fmllscx,t1_fmlfamk,1586188894.0,Thank youuu:)
StopSelfHarm,fmle5tj,t3_fvz7l4,1586184599.0,"Just keep reminding yourself of why you don’t want to, it’s good you have reasons keeping you trying to stop. Remember your strong for going as long as you have and you can do it, try to distract yourself, find something else to do, text your friend who you agreed to take care of yourselves with, it can be about you worrying about relapsing if you think that’ll help or it can be about a random topic like Scooby-Doo just to get your mind off it.
I hope this helps in any way."

StopSelfHarm,fe4xujg,t1_fe4vu7i,1578863854.0,"It’s okay, you do deserve to stop cutting, even if you only ever did it once, you still deserve to stop, I’m glad I’ve helped some, I hope the app helps you and good luck for the future, I hope you do well."
StopSelfHarm,fe4vjem,t1_fe4urva,1578863150.0,You’re welcome! Hopefully I helped even a little bit
StopSelfHarm,fe4sskl,t1_fe4red3,1578862428.0,All self harm is valid no matter how much it is or how long it is. And personally I use an app called “I am sober” that tracks how long you’ve been clean from self harm or whatever addiction and you can post about how it’s going and people can reply and post themselves and you can see that they’re going through similar situations as you. And it also helps me see my clean streaks as accomplishments instead of whenever I cut as one.
StopSelfHarm,fe4pjtn,t1_fe4n8ic,1578861621.0,"Please do quit, nobody should ever continue cutting, it’s and awful habit especially if it gets out of hand, you can still be not okay and not cut, but I do completely understand what your going through and how it just feels wrong."
StopSelfHarm,fe4mk9p,t3_enhn32,1578860889.0,"Hi, I cut too, and I’m trying to stop as well, I get what you saying, it’s like if I quit doing it it feels good but it feels wrong like how dare you? You must be alright then because your not cutting but I’m not completely alright so it feels wrong to not cut and I feel like I should, but that’s not right, it would be amazing if you could quit while your ahead and know you could, and I hope to quit too. Best of luck to you, I hope you quit and you’ll be okay"
