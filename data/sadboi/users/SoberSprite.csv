It must be kind of frustrating to have your spouse still drinking when you're trying to quit.

I have been filling up  my time with doing a lot of reading lately. Also going for long walks, meditation and cooking. It may be kind of boring, but it's infinitely better than being hungover all the time IMO. 

If you're an artist, maybe you could start a new time consuming project. I like to paint sometimes myself. At times I find it difficult to get started, but once I've begun the process seems to go a lot easier.

Do something that gets you out of your comfort zone, whatever that may be. 

Personally I spent so many years getting wasted and doing stupid things, that I don't even mind having a quiet life. I'm doing a lot of cooking, reading books, meditating, getting into shape, etc. Perhaps it's time for you to take up a hobby that you have always wanted to do. Play the guitar, learn to paint, build something, take a new class or pick up a new sport. I think you will less bored if you do something to challenge yourself.

weightwatchers,fqe99fp,t3_gidwo4,1589303824.0,"Hi, it sounds like you've had two periods where you essentially fell off the plan and gained back weight, so you've been yo-yo dieting a lot. My experience with Weight Watchers is I will lose around a pound a week if I really stick to the program, but it's a long term commitment. 

I'm also on the green plan, my general strategy is to not eat any of my fit points and to try dipping into my weeklies as little as possible. 

If you need a reality check, I would try logging in all of your food with My Fitness Pal for around a week to see how many calories you are really consuming. I think the biggest problem people experience with Weight Watchers is eating too many 0 point foods (they still contain calories). But if your menu is like the one you posted above, that wouldn't seem to be a problem for you."
