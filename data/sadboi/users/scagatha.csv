AskSF,fi8pn31,t1_fi8nc8t,1582245493.0,"No, speaking from experience unless they are in some kind of network together, one doctor is not going to be extremely helpful in getting you to see another one. They can make recommendations of where to go but it doesn't guarantee they'll be taking new patients or your insurance (you didn't mention if you are self-pay or not).

Finding a therapist is going to be a lot harder than a psychiatrist. Insurance pays peanuts for therapy which is why most don't accept it, and then you actually have to get the right personality fit on top of that. Psychology today would probably be your best bet. You're just going to have to pound the pavement and make a lot of phone calls, or get a direct referral from someone you know who knows they're accepting new patients. Paying out of pocket helps a lot, and if you are doing so I would mention that when you leave a voicemail."
AskSF,fi841hh,t3_f6xd6m,1582233057.0,"So you have Kaiser HMO insurance but you're looking to go out of network because Kaiser's mental health care is the worst. Are you just going to go with the self-pay route or are you looking to have Kaiser pay the provider? The reason I ask is because it's easier to find good help if you're doing self-pay. I go to therapy and my psychologist doesn't take insurance at all and he says that's the case for most good therapists in the city.

Your post title says you need a psychiatrist (meds) but your post talks about issues you'd most likely need a counselor or psychologist (talk therapy) for. Can you clarify?

Finding good help is really tough. I'm currently going through the nearly impossible task of finding a psychiatrist that takes medi-cal since I lost my insurance. It was hard enough finding my previous psychiatrist when I had private insurance and now I have to start all over again."

When I was a baby bat goth clubbing in the early 2000s there would be a lot of interpersonal drama because it was such a small community. Not so much anymore, everyone seems to be very friendly with one another. That could just be due to age though?

The goth club plays goth and industrial music. Goth is a genre that evolved from punk in the 80s.  The most famous bands are Bauhaus, Siouxsie & the Banshees, The Cure, and Sisters of Mercy.  Industrial is a genre of harsh electronic/rock music that also came out of the 80s. Industrial music fans are called rivetheads. Famous bands are Skinny Puppy, Ministry, Nine Inch Nails and KMFDM. There is a lot of overlap with the fashion and people who enjoy both genres so both clubs I go to have two rooms with each focused on one genre. It's an equal mix of men and women.

BurningMan,fapyh41,t3_eae8c3,1576295235.0,"Pre-cook, vacuum seal and freeze meals in individual portions so you can boil them in the bag to warm them up (if you don't have a microwave). My #1 thing to make is bacon, egg and cheese on an english muffin individually wrapped. It's a whole grab-n-go meal because you don't get very hungry out there. 1 minute in the microwave. I also like to buy the costco frozen premade meal things like the yakisoba noodles. Also have enough nonperishable foods to live off in case of emergency, like cans of soup or those tastybite indian food pouches. You will have lots of food left over at the end of the week, better safe than sorry.  And pickles, can't forget the pickles."

And I'm glad you turned out fine without a mask but I'd advise anyone to wear one when it gets really dusty. I felt fine during the week rarely wearing a mask but when I came back I spent a solid week in agony with a bad case of playa lung. I seriously regretted not wearing the mask."
