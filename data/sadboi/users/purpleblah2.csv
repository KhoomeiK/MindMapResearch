I don't know if it's zero or just very low but people WILL steal things off the ""ground"" (the big square stuff appears on). Having things on the ground will also attract scavengers, there are also tracks (the little footprint icons on the map) that can lead others to your base if you don't cover them up.  


Also the cryo facility is a terrible place to make a base, IMO. It baits you with the unique campsite features, but the place is constantly swarmed by wild dogs and cannibals coming from Zom-Zom's, and there isn't that much loot or safety. I usually make my base near the two friendly factions, so I can trade and benefit from the safety of friendly patrols (though usually just DMC, because ATN is Dogman territory). My point is, making a base at the cryo facility is annoying once you get waken up for the tenth time in a row by a wild dog in one night."

Slings are okay for the early game, especially with how common rocks and pebbles are. A bow is a relatively safe mid-game weapon, but it lacks stopping power and waiting for all the tiny cuts it causes to take down a dogman or even Bad Mutha before they kick your ass isn't a good bet.
