I hope you make it to that point too. I am glad your arm is still there. I nearly lost my legs a couple of times and I couldn't stop even if I had to take that risk. I hope you get better too. It is so hard to make small cuts if you still need them once you have gone big. I can remember well, that's why I need to tell you,  you are not alone.

SuicideWatch,f3o2sc8,t3_dhdsaf,1571006977.0,Cold leads to tightened blood vessels which can be one of the most extensive pain. So if you think this is a very passive easy way to die you are mistaken. If I was taking hours long cold baths in order to stop cutting in the psych ward it was a rather helpful method because the cold was sometimes more painful than cuts which made made me faint from blood loss..

But it has been done. They use a virus for example splice some DNA which is the missing part in to it for example or modify some of your own stem cells. As I remember they broke down the immune system with chemotherapy before injecting.

CPTSD,f3m6ixk,t3_dhau8g,1570983789.0,I was in the same spiral with conservative therapy. Hypnosis after Erikson is what got me out. It is about using your subconscious which often has more solutions and that way you learn to progress again. and we usually all know what would help just can't really proceed in all that. I wish you all the best. It does take time but usually good techniques too.

I don't really like that. my therapist told me I need to learn to protect myself better and I should learn how to be less appealing.  But it seems I need the dangerous things in order to cope. Some days music and boxing aren't enough..  It is a bit about having pediatrician parents. You are not supposed to live unhealthy at least cause it yourself ( only being a smoking molesting Workaholic was alright for them some how..) I am actually less afraid.

Just take enough water with it and I like to drink it cool so the body will have to heat it up. A bit strict but its how I like it.
fasting,f3c96vt,t1_f3b0i0c,1570821329.0,They shouldnt do that. Sorry but are you sure you only take vitamins? Besides Placebo it shouldn't be felt in any way. It takes more days to supplement a Lack of vitamins so you shouldn't even have a body sensation in a good way. Only emotionally..
fasting,f3c8n3b,t1_f3bxdvj,1570821089.0,I don't think they break the fast in sense of breaking ketosis its so little calories. The water you will have to drink literally burns these four or maybe seven calories by being heated and processed by the body. I use to drink that too if I am fasting more than three days. Doctors told me it helps if I feel low blood pressure.

fasting,f3c7lcl,t3_dgbf4c,1570820732.0,But you might be drinking a Lot?  Cant imagine no loss at all. I mean you can forget or confuse. But if I only drink water I will lose at least three Kilos a week. But you are doing great.  Maybe if you keep writing your weight down it is encouraging. Can be both. Days can appear long if you are hungry. I am proud of you. Being healthy can be so challenging. Sending you support. If the scale is trouble I use to pick one dress. Because measuring can be upsetting if I take slightly different parts of the hip for example. How do you do it?  I use to be obsessed easily.  I am best of with low control.  I am mean the body has to burn something if you don't have any intake.. So I don't need to control anything right?

I eat will only drink some vegetable brothers after ten days of eat some Tomatoes with salt.  Sodium and potassium can be missing.  But otherwise if you feel fine you should be fine. I was in the mental ward while I fasted. But due to other reasons but therefore I had medical attention during my first long fast. And the tested blood and such. But although I was not overweight they said it was alright.

But you can't do that every month of course. But it is not unhealthy if you are not underweight and exercising so you don't shut down.  And it is important to slowly Start eating again. Don't binge and not too fatty. But of course you need solid food some day.

I always get told a lot even by my state attorney that my case is worse than what they have seen so far. Feels good to hear  a different response but I am not sure you would say so if I told you more. Because people who have a lot of experience have never told me differently. I am only 21 but I have gotten a lot of quantity of assessment. And if someone had experience worse than me  they would be dead I guess. Because I was close so many times. And I didn't want to life in this world if there was any worse. I have issues staying here as it is. But besides that I am really really glad what you told me. I  am fasting since I posted. And I went to the gym three times.

If I just let go another part of me can happen to take over. That can be dangerous. But I am trying my hardest. I try to get healthy and discover what I can use in order to do that.  Discussing it is helping a lot some days.

But if I am not responsible than the reality of my mom not helping me my dad nearly killing me,  actually he did and reanimated me.  He is a doctor so it is a Reflex. So I do not necessarily feel safe. Since he is not behind bars I am not really safe. He will hopefully soon be,  but justice System is slow..  If I allow myself to be weak I might not stop gaining because I feel so scared. Even my pediatrician actually Reporter injuries but since my parents were colleges with them no action was taken. (It will help me in court but it didn't helped me then)  I want to feel guilty because then I feel my life is not as much at risk..

I hope you find people that deserve you and treat you like you need it.  Take care. You matter. I love you, for not being loved enough,  because you need it.  As simple as that.  💜 take care"

Someone who resents who treated you so wrong?  Someone to care about what?  Please let me know.  I care about you.:)"
