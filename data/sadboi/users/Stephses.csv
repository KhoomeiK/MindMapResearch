You will definitely be able to bring up all the other things you wish to discuss, your therapist should never make you feel like you can't bring something up. Most therapists understand you might not be comfortable bringing up everything in the first session, some things might be too personal to share with essentially a stranger, even though they are important and you want to discuss them. It's also important to remember that the ""plan"" or process on how to help you is collaborative and flexible, it should be able to change depending on what you're going through at the time, and you should be able to give feedback for what is and isn't working for you.
And it's ok to discuss your concerns about what your therapist might be thinking about you with your therapist, even if it seems odd at first, whenever I've done it my T has been nothing but reassuring and non-judgmental."

It is kinda like starting from scratch in terms of you have to get comfortable with the new T, and they have to get to know you, but you still have all the things you discussed with your current T and you bring that knowledge with you.
Starting again is often not a pleasant idea (I have to swap therapists in 1 month, so I know the feeling), but it's not as bad as it seems either.
I would also ask your current T if maybe they could send an email to your new T with file notes etc, so then half of the introductory work is already done for you.

You were not wrong to discuss it with your boss. You were rude by not showing any compassion for someone who is struggling. If she was having days off for cancer treatment you wouldn't bat an eye. Your boss should brainstorm ways to accommodate her and her mental health so that other people don't get overloaded.
