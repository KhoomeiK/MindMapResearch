I've lost 10 pounds, 10 more to go.

Good luck fellow traveler."

I've also had conversations with these folks during non depressed days and set up strategies with them for what to do. For instance one friend will make time for video games and time by his fire if I ask and tell him I'm depressed. It has been a lot of trial and error.

Broken by Anson Seabra has recently resonated with me. In part because my bipolar tells me I am hamming it up it's not that bad. In truth it tends to be that bad.

Hope something there is useful. I'm stable here after 7.5 years of counseling and learning about bipolar."

3) What are you going to do next period?

4) Do you need external help?

There are a few things I wish I knew. But first I want to make sure you know about. https://www.stayexempt.irs.gov/ It has training on how to apply all the way to keeping your status.

1) A lawyer to help with Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws is a great thing. It's worth the cost. (I did end up going that route but should have started there)

2) The amount of work you think it will be, double that if you haven't done it before.

3) Make sure you understand each question on the 501c3 application. This does entail some research but its worth it. Your application is a lot less likely to come back and can get approved quickly. ( My status was approved in 10 days after filing)

4) Choose a fiscal year that doesn't follow the normal tax year. This way it's easier to get help if you have 990 questions.

5) Budget and get accounting software. QuickBooks is what I just purchased, wish I'd don't that at the start. Instead I learned putting together financial statements manually is a pain.

6) Build systems and infrastructure around your programs and services. Ideally you want your steps repeatable by someone else. Work that way at the start.

7) Be in it for the right reason(s). I've met so many folks who's end goal is to pay their bills with the organization. That's not a bad goal in and of itself but if that's your end goal I'd argue your inauthentic and go start a for profit.

8) Give yourself time off, the first six months or so of me doing my Non profit work I was working 7 days a week. 5 at my day job and then a packed 2 for my organization on the weekend.

9) It is still work if your not getting paid for it.

10) Are you passionate about this?"
