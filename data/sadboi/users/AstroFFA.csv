I'm in college currently, the first of my immediate family to go, and I probably wouldn't be here if I was raised the same as either of my sisters (my parents tried different parenting styles on each of us) as I was growing up, my parents let me go wherever I wanted, hang out with who I wanted, do what I wanted, all that. I had no reason to ever lie to them because we had mutual respect and trust for each other. Of course I knew they always had my back if I needed help, but having that freedom really just made my life so much more enjoyable and I'll be forever grateful for that after reading some of these replies about strict parents.
