BPD,fr5erco,t3_gms8xm,1589907362.0,"I can intellectually know what situations contributed to the abandonment issues throughout childhood, but the reason knowing doesn't fix the problem is because the abandonment fear is usually much more deeply rooted than the triggering circumstances on the surface. In pwBPD, the root of it is usually a lack of object permanence correctly forming during VERY early childhood, generally in kids who are ""left to cry it out,"" and the result is a fundamental problem comprehending people still loving them when they aren't around. I often have freak outs when I have a few days off work, sure my coworkers will forget about me, decide in that time that they are better off without me, etc. You get the idea. It's proven to be the hardest thing for me to personally kick while in treatment, and I believe it's because it's such a basic concept to grasp but I don't know how to feel something that's never been there, ya know?

There are people whose environmental situations should cause intense abandonment issues but instead either don't, or they are easier to treat because of this reason. 

I hope this made sense!! Thank you for trying to understand instead of writing us off as toxic and crazy! Even though we can be sometimes!"

A lot of people surprise me with just how understanding they are about it. Just a simple ""hey are we still cool?"" can be a good way to casually reach out for that reassurance. I have one friend who also struggles with this, which makes things difficult sometimes, so we made an emoji code that we can send one another if we feel like we're losing touch/having possibly unfounded thoughts that the other is mad/just need some love and reassurance, and that has been life changing and I may try to implement the same thing with some other friends.

If it does seem like you're being gaslighted after that, then it's usually best to cut off the ones doing it, as that's toxic and we don't need it in our lives."
BPD,ettskkp,t1_esy699h,1563194648.0,"It's not sweet to manipulate people and blame it on your mental illness. It isn't okay to bring someone into a mess you don't plan on cleaning up. He doesn't see something special, he has glorified Stockholm Syndrome."
BPD,etsibkb,t3_ccwcuu,1563146366.0,"Get Me Out Of Here by Rachel Reiland was helpful in that it gave me insight as to why I do some of the things I do. It also gave me hope that it IS possible to get better, have a life worth living."
BPD,etshimi,t3_cczahw,1563145755.0,"It seems like my best days turn into my worst ones because I don't know what to do if I'm not crisis-ing about something, so I find something to be nervous about and spiral from there. I guess it's normal for pwbpd but I know it's self destructive as the fuck. You miss the chaos because you've had to cling to it for your whole life."
BPD,etsh6p1,t3_ccztps,1563145503.0,"I feel this. At those times, no one expects anything of you. No one wants you to be this place at this time, and everyone else is asleep, so to hell with any kind of social pressures. I don't see how it could be harmful, we're just vampires of the night haha."
BPD,etsg64p,t3_cd7q54,1563144750.0,"I have a habit of making friends with all my coworkers, I think it's partially because I don't get out much outside of work, but I've found that when I'm friends with them, it almost makes me even more paranoid than with non-work friends (they hate me, they only pretend to be my friend bc we work together, etc.)
Which has led to me staying at toxic-ass jobs, because ""if I leave, my friends won't talk to me anymore, because they're work friends."""

BPD,esyc296,t3_c9gvxg,1562341645.0,"If you stay with him, he must set firm boundaries and stick to them. ""You cheat again, I will leave"" and he has to follow through, and you have to know he will. Otherwise, you're both just setting up a chaotic, unhealthy, abusive relationship. Love doesn't keep a relationship together. Love is a feeling. Commitment, trust, and respect do, as those are actions. If you were on the other side, even if you wanted to stay in the relationship, would it not be traumatic to think that your partner might be sleeping with someone else? Our trauma doesn't give us a pass to be abusive to other people. Best of luck."
