I have attempted suicide many times in the past 5 years. And I remember how horrible the initial aftermath was. I remember that night sometimes and I think of January 25th 2019. Now it feels weird to think back to that moment when I was sure that was going to be my last moment of being alive. Obviously I am still here, but I when I think about Le Soonflower , Su Li Choi Jin Ri and Mi Yeong Sook I wonder why is it so that I am still alive but they are not."

Then, you can divorce him."

The truth maybe a harsh pill to swallow. But at the same time, she is your daughter with addiction/alcoholic tendencies. Those all came from somewhere. Maybe she uses it to cope with the traumatic experiences she went through as a child. She wanted to be a parent and could not. It's fine to be honest.
