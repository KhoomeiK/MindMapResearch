Keep in mind these mods are ***third party*** and are *not* guaranteed to work at any time being if the game is updated or the mod is updated.  


Do you have your trackers assigned in the right order in SteamVR aswell? Its another small, usually skipped step.   


I know the latest versions of the mod have been having some issues with feet and arms, If you still havent been able to resolve it, i highly suggest contacting the current developer of the mod to find a possible solution."

I have had the same issues you have had before, and i believe that is due to the mods developer, and you should contact the mod creator about a solution!

I do as well think they should be implementing such features, but others should be coming first. *Keep in mind Beat Games is a very small team of developers.*"

Vive,f9pe1rp,t1_f9pcyrs,1575531482.0,"Theres a couple mods required, but its pretty easy. (this will include setup for recording videos)  


the first mod required is CustomAvatars, it can be found on Modassistant. This mod is used to give you an avatar that will represent your trackers as a person.

  
the second mod required is CameraPlus (also known as Camera+), it too can be found on Modassistant. This allows you to create a third person camera so you can view said avatar.  


the third item you will need is an avatar that supports full body tracking. you can find them here.  [https://bsaber.com/avatars/](https://bsaber.com/avatars/)   
make sure you get one with the tag ""Full Body Tracking"" or ""FBT"". it will not work without this.  


launch beat saber, right click the screen on your PC (not in vr) and select the ""Third person"" button in the menu that appears. Your desktop view should now be in third person.  


now, go into vr, and you should see a small mirror with a white square next to it. use the selecting saber to move it to the desired position by clicking and dragging the white box.  


go to the avatars menu and select the avatar you downloaded. if FBT isnt working, then the avatar does not support it (keep in mind, it will not auto-configure trackers. they are linked to a specific one)
