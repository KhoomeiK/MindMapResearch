I used spray oil, only a tsp of paprika, a tsp of mustard instead of Worcestershire sauce, and reduced fat creme fraiche instead of sour cream as I can’t have sour cream in the fridge without going wild.

Some things that have worked for me are: setting a limit on when I have to stop eating- so I’m not allowed to eat anything after 8pm no matter how hungry I think I am. It’s hard to begin with but you get used to it after a while. Also occupy your time with things to take your mind off eating, I know it’s hard being stuck indoors but maybe try a new hobby of some kind? I’ve started learning a language on Duolingo. Lastly, if all fails, have some calorie counted snacks set aside that will give you a tiny hit of salt or sugar but won’t totally mess up your progress. Even if you have to make them quite high calorie to begin with, at least it won’t be 3k +, then you can maybe taper down."

I sometimes alternate with NARS tinted moisturiser which is also good for a nice glowy finish when I don’t want too much coverage.

askwomenadvice,fl18vo1,t1_fl17qbe,1584724270.0,"Also for some practical advice instead of ~youre perfect the way you are~ because tbh I would hate hearing that when I was 21 - use tumblr or Pinterest to look at styles you like, create a kind of vision board of what you want to look like if that helps. Follow people on Instagram that have similar styles and just take it from there. Don’t fall into the trap of copying whatever people are doing online, but after a while you’ll realise what your personal style is and what you can do to achieve that. Have a look at your face shape and body shape and really think about what might suit you and what you would feel comfortable wearing or looking like. 

The trap with Instagram is that almost anything looks great on a model or an influencer. So really think about how you would look in things versus that-person-looks good-so-I-might-look-like-that-if-I-wear-what-they-wear (I made this mistake a lot in my early 20s)

Lastly, just try and ask girls around you who you might admire how they did their makeup or where they get their hair done or what brand foundation they use. People are generally nice about this stuff if you word it into a compliment like “omg your skin looks flawless what foundation do you use??”"
askwomenadvice,fl17qbe,t3_flx491,1584723627.0,"I think sometimes if women have a mother that conforms to stereotypical gender conventions, or have older sisters they’re more inclined to pick up these things as they grow older. Also depending on your friendship circle, you’re more likely to develop interests or skills in applying makeup if you’re all putting it on together before going out etc.

I’m really good at putting on eyeliner because I was a massive emo as a teen, so all my friends were into winged liner - we used to share tips & borrow each other’s makeup. On the other hand I cannot for the life of me braid hair or do anything involving a plait because it wasn’t my style or in my frame of reference.

Mothers can also force these values into their kids - I was taken to get my eyebrows done at a super young age because I had a monobrow. Another type of mother might have just left it. But now because of this my eyebrows are ~on point~ all of the time, but I have some inner shame and insecurities about them stemming from my mother’s way of dealing with me. Sometimes these traditional feminine practices cane be used to mask deep insecurities which can be generationally passed down.

If there’s something traditionally feminine that you enjoy - say lipstick or perfume, YouTube and Instagram are great resources to find out more. I wouldn’t recommend getting into something just because it’s ~what you’re supposed to do~ some women enjoy all these things and some don’t. Don’t waste your time trying to catch up as it were. You’ll have gained skills in many other things while I was doing my eyeliner.

Also in my experience as a 31yr old, most people just have the appearance of having their shit together. No-one really knows what they’re doing even if it looks like they do."

But not mentally ill because I wasn’t making myself throw up. Also I felt like I was better because you don’t associate eating disorders with actual eating?? 

I’m not sure where you’re from but have you tried to access help from your doctors or a local ED charity? I’m currently getting therapy from a local eating disorder service. It took 6 months on a waiting list but it was worth it.

My current recovery is focusing on hobbies. I’ve realised all my joy comes from food. Good day = nice fancy meal. Bad day = takeaway. Just going food shopping fills me with joy or meal planning gives me that dopamine hit lol

Honestly just trying to do things unrelated to food is a big step. If you’re anything like me, logging calories and weight loss and eating has become a hobby. We need to break out of the cycle and find other things to use our energy on."

With a regular gp it can be difficult to get referred as there’s no real cure or management of it outside of an educational setting, if that makes sense? 
You can get a specialist private diagnosis but they can cost a lot of money. 

I’m not sure what would be best here, as it can feel good to finally be diagnosed and have an answer to ~the way you are~ and it can certainly make other people more sympathetic, but paying so much for someone to tell you about it & then offer no solutions isn’t great.

Tbh I don’t think you should need a diagnosis for a condition for your partner to be nice and sympathetic to your needs. Many people have quirks and an inability to do certain things AND have supportive partners without making it a medical thing. I think it’s worth trying to get your partner to actually understand you as a person than waste money getting a diagnosis.

I got diagnosed really late through university (age 30) and it’s helped with giving me a “legitimate” reason for not being able to ride a bike for example. The difference is that everyone I’m close to had just accepted that I’m not good with balance and spatial awareness so I’ve never needed to explain or prove myself to them. The diagnosis made no difference in my relationships. I know it’s cliche but you should be surrounding yourself with people that accept you for who you are."

Then it’s just a process of educating them on why you don’t think it’s good to eat animals. Most kids are pretty receptive to the message of it doesn’t feel like they’re being deprived of what they consider their normal food.

Also if you don’t have any non-vegan food it in the house as a rule, then they just have to eat vegan. They will definitely get used to it as long the meals aren’t a massive departure from what they’re used to.

The only issue you might find is if they then decide to refuse food at your partner’s house, making life difficult for your partner or if your partner gives them conflicting information to try & get them to eat whatever they’ve cooked - just keep that mind as something that might have to be addressed with your ex"

I love the ~idea~ of HAES, that yes people can be healthy at different sizes (but probably not when you get to super morbid obesity where you can’t move...). That you can be skinny and super unhealthy- so as a basis health doesn’t always depend on body size. I like this idea at the root of haes, but the community online seems to be v toxic. It’s far more focused on people accepting being fat at any cost to health. 

I’ve followed haes accounts before when recovering from my ED expecting to see videos of chubbier people exercising or tips about the best exercise when you have massive boobs etc. Like a community about being healthy that isn’t focused on weight, but all they are focused on is fat acceptance rather than health in any way.

Take me for example- I’ve gained weight recently due to ED recovery. I’m finding this really difficult as exercising is now more difficult than it should be. If I joined a haes group they would recommend that I accept my ‘fatness’- but personally it just ~feels~ bad. It’s not an aesthetic thing, I literally feel worse running when there is chub moving or rubbing. 

I’m not sure what I’m trying to say tbh, on one hand ppl shouldn’t be discriminated against for being fat but on the other, ppl shouldn’t feel bad engaging in behaviours that are associated with weight loss. There has to be a middle ground or a more nuanced understanding about weight."
