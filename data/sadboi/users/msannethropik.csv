GrowingMarijuana,fq4qgoo,t1_fq4p1sn,1589081793.0,"When the plant is this young, you want to be careful with the potassium levels. Potassium is best saved for the flowering stage after you are happy with where your plant is at during vegetation. With too much potassium too early, you will risk the roots ceasing uptake of other essential nutrients.

Nitrogen is arguably the most important plant food at this stage. So, you’re going to want to look at the contents in the plant food that you bought and see the distribution of nutrients. Take a look at some articles on Leafly or other cannabis grow blogs. Nitrogen should be a good 10-12% at a minimum to start. It’s where the rich green chlorophyll will start. 

Calcium/Magnesium is where I started gently adding more essential nutrients about 2 weeks into transferring into the final medium. 

Be careful also at this stage that you don’t introduce too many nutrients at once. It could shock the roots and throw off pH."

I felt like the biggest scum having to obtain a signature from someone who was ill, finally going home, next to the amount owed *on an ambulance mid-ride*. 

That company is also fucked. Rejected a transport after a 13 hr shift from a 12. I have back problems, and the overnight crew arrived at the station by 11pm (my crew was done at 12am.) I rejected a transport I was dispatched because I was *done* and told dispatch 8 hours earlier that i was at my physical limit for the week. 

Wasn’t a 911— would never reject that. But a standard transport and the owner’s bff Lt crew is chillin’ in the bunk bed room?
