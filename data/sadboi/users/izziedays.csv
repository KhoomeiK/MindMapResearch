I have some dog sitting gigs coming up where I’m expected to stay at their house alone while they’re gone for a few days and I do think that’ll help him become more independent."

JustNoSO,fqfgrp3,t1_fqffbl7,1589324601.0,I’m having a hard time defining the line between depression and not even trying. I have ADHD so get the struggle of getting distracted and needing help but I took my mental health into my own hands and got on meds and researched coping mechanisms until I found what worked. I also remember how hard it was when all the effort I was mustering wasn’t enough so I hate telling him that he’s not trying when I don’t actually know.
JustNoSO,fqfg1iy,t1_fqfez7n,1589324237.0,"He’ll do it eventually as in after I’ve been asking for a week or he’ll spend his savings to buy us dinner or something which I don’t support.

JustNoSO,fqfdwc0,t1_fqest8d,1589323166.0,Yeah that’s the plan. I’m done cooking for him and telling him to do his chores. It’s not my job and not my problem. His mom did everything for him so that probably played a big role but it’s time he figured it out that I’m not and never will be his parent.
JustNoSO,fqer086,t1_fqegslp,1589312161.0,"Before the virus hit it was better because he’d be home alone and have access to the washer all day but since everyone else is working from home they do their laundry all day seemingly everyday. Like I also struggle to do laundry because of this so it’s not just him. 

Their baby also used to stay at their parents when they worked but now we have to work around her naps as well. He could still at least make himself cereal or a sandwich or SOMETHING"
JustNoSO,fqeqaa8,t1_fqeiflb,1589311819.0,Realistically there’s nothing *I* can do besides leave him but at this moment that’s not what I want to do. He has depression and most likely ADHD so I told him I want him to try out therapy and medication and he agreed.

adhdwomen,fq72bod,t3_gh0w6n,1589140875.0,"I've done a lot of babysitting and I currently live with an infant (not mine, my niece). For me personally, it was the outside motivation I needed to get things done. Like if my executive dysfunction was acting up hearing them cry or knowing that they're parents were relying on me kick started my brain and got me going. Honestly, caring for children is one of the only things that has ever come naturally to me. Do not feel like that has to be the case for you though. For plenty of people, women mostly, parenting and childcare is not something that comes naturally and that's 110% normal and okay. Just don't think your ADHD would automatically make you a terrible parent or partner.

Also, parenting isn't being 100% all the time! On days that I really just was not feeling able to be 100% there for them I'd find random things that would keep them busy like a scavenger hunt or a running relay!"

He didn’t go on enough walks and didn’t have anyone to play with most of the day as their kids were 4 and 2 and the mom has a bad back. They didn’t do any training or any research. They ended up rehoming him a couple months later because he kept tackling the kids.
