bipolar2,fp3hp7h,t3_gb1dpu,1588279493.0,"When I was in crisis very often, I made a countdown plan. I would do each thing on the list for 10 minutes and then move on to the next if I still felt like I was in crisis. Mine was something like: 


10) Color

9) Play video games

8) Look at baby animal pictures 

7) Go to mental safe place 

6) Listen to music 

5) Meditate

4) Call friend

3) Suicide hotline 

2)Call therapist

1)Go to hospital


So the closer you get to one, the more severe the crisis. But hopefully you’ll get distracted/calmer/whatever during like 10-5.

misanthropy,fnad3yb,t3_g06c3m,1586795391.0,"Yes, because I’ve felt it. If there’s anything that makes life worth it, it’s how I feel when I’m with my partner. Been together for over a decade. It’s like having a second brain— inside jokes, shared memories and of course regular, amazing sex. Its partly just familiarity, but while other people drain me he is like a breath of fresh air. It’s like the feeling of getting into a hot bath mixed with that swooping feeling of being on a roller coaster. 


I know not all misanthropes want to die, but I did. For years. And when I finally tried and failed, I realized how my love for him had made me want to live which seemed like it had weakened me. I don’t live for myself anymore. I can’t leave him. So yes, I think it’s real and I’m happy to have it. But it also seems like a flaw to be so codependent. Love is real, but is it worth it? 


Also, most marriages are not as happy as mine. Lasting love takes patience and knowing a person better than you know yourself. If I was married to anyone else but my husband I think I would hate it."
