I think that, concerning (straight) romantic relationships, men are almost always expected to ""make the first move"". So it could be problematic for more shy and introverted boys, unlike shy girls (like me) who don't have to worry about making the first move because they think it's the boy who will do it. In all my romantic relationships with men, it has always been the man who made the first move.

&#x200B;

Also, I guess that men are educated to hide their feelings as much as possible (bc.. I don't know, men are supposed to be ""strong"" so they shouldn'tshow that they can be vulnerable I think ?) so it should be 1000 times as much as embarassing for a man who is struggling emotionally to reach out and ask for help, thus most of them may conceal their problems to others  & deal with them..
