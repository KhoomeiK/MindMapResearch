ChronicPain,fqz84e7,t1_fqyow3v,1589761868.0,I would be living with a couple other people maybe but I’m so paranoid I thought I might look into a life alert or something just to feel better lol. Just Incase my roommates aren’t with me and I feel kind of scared. I feel like the pressure to find a partner is on because I don’t want to be alone but I realized I should’ve probably just focus on bettering my health and not finding someone because I didn’t want to be alone. But one step at a time I guess lol. Thanks for the advice!
ChronicPain,fqz7vyu,t1_fqyv95n,1589761726.0,Yeah I kind of hinted to my mom that although I’m going to try that I might have to come back from time to time if it gets to bad I’m just lucky I have parents that are understanding and not forcing me to be on my own completely. The hardest thing so far has been pacing myself and learning I can’t go as hard as I used to with certain things and I need to protect myself from hurting worse. Thank you sm for the input
ChronicPain,fnpgv4l,t1_fnpflcn,1587145278.0,"I’m in the middle of a diagnosis right now, just waiting for my blood work to show if it’s in an autoimmune disease, then my doc said we’ll go from there. The type of pain medication my doc wants me to start on depending on my diagnosis isn’t exactly an opioid, it’ll treat both pain/anxiety because she agrees my anxiety isn’t probably helping. Itll probably be a slow diagnosis because I’m probably not going to be starting physical therapy until this pandemic is over and I’m trying to keep my doctors appointments to the very bare minimum. I’m blessed to have a doctor that takes me seriously and wants to get to the bottom of it because in this thread I see a lot of people who have issues with finding one. I think once we know if it’s auto immune then we can start buckling down on what type of problem I have exactly."

Kim literally donates a shit ton of money, helped free several people from incarceration, refused gifts and instead asked for donations when north was born, helped house a family after it was destroyed in a hurricane, and is studying to pass her Barr exam but because she made a sex tape years ago she’s boiled down to a dumb whore? I don’t love the Kardashian’s but you guys are being down right wicked for no reason in this comment section."

medical,fn0ti87,t1_fn0reth,1586548440.0,I do have pretty severe anxiety
medical,fn0jlxv,t1_fn07dv1,1586543141.0,"I do take a vitamin that has calcium so it could possible be that. I’m not sure if they did test me for that, I did have my thyroid checked a few years ago and it was okay, but I do believe my birth control causes me to have an insane unbalance. I started taking my Vitamin B I want to say about two weeks ago."
medical,fmyojwk,t1_fmynpml,1586491310.0,"I do have some of those symptoms and I think I should bring it up to my doctor because I am on birth control, but I think they might have seen that In my MRI scan. I’m not sure what they were looking for in the scan but all I knew is that they wanted to rule out a seizure."
medical,fmykgst,t1_fmyjlom,1586488342.0,"Damn, that’s a long ass time. It really is frustrating. My doctor won’t look into my MS concerns and give me a spinal tap because my MRI came up clear, so I’m trying to look for a different one but unfortunately I’m not severe enough for them to accept anything over a over the phone appointment right now. I might have to travel a while to go see my home town doctor who takes things very seriously unfortunately. Thank you for the advice!"
AmItheAsshole,fmxof0z,t3_fy14z3,1586468794.0,"Esh. Nether of you are mature enough for a relationship. Gf shouldn’t have blown up on you without talking about it calmly. You don’t ask for a break the second things get messy because I presume you don’t want to deal with it, then call her a bitch when she calls you out for it."
Showerthoughts,fl4aiiw,t1_fl49wnc,1584809447.0,Ah yes because years from now “stock market drops the lowest its even been because former Instagram models aren’t getting jobs” makes a lot of sense really.
Advice,fl49wmy,t3_fmhobg,1584809083.0,"It ain’t worth it man. If she’s pressuring you to do something your not cool with, extra not worth it. If it some how doesn’t work out you don’t wanna look back and think “damn remember when I caught the Rona for a girl.”"
BPD,fkg6awg,t3_fi06qa,1584151013.0,I used to smoke a ton. Doing the math I averaged like 4 gs a day and this is no way a brag. It helped me stay away from reality and become the numb person I so desperately wanted. I also used it for its intended medicinal uses too. (Anxiety and chronic pain). Unfortunately I was one of the one in like one million who received a laced bag. Completely made me terrified to go back to smoking. I felt so fucking awful the first few days after smoking everyday for three years straight. But after months of ether not smoking or maybe just smoking a joint a day my bpd got so much better. I stopped crying all the time and having terrible mental break downs. Granted I have my days but it honestly has gotten a lot better. I think being able to finally feel emotions lifted a lot of pressure of constantly trying to suppress. Definitely not saying it works for everyone just giving some insight from an ex heavy ass stoner.

Advice,fk2sg4a,t1_fk2qv6i,1583808099.0,Thank you! The whole situation sucked but I was incredibly young but thankfully I came out stronger having gone through it all.
Advice,fk2q7ou,t3_fg6h2v,1583806634.0,"Most definitely. Guys like this get off on power. He’s trying to belittle you with those comments. 
Make you feel like he’s got something above you. A loving boyfriend should hype you up before a test, tell you how great your going to be. It’ll only be a matter of time before the comments come more often, and more aggressive. I had a boyfriend like that. His little comments turned into full blown personal attack’s. His little “pushes” and very intense grabs turned into full blown smacking me in the face. Please get out before it gets worse. It only leads to years of getting over the trauma. You’ll find someone who will truly treat you wonderful one day, it’s so worth the wait. The second a man lays his hands on you, run far far away, before something serious happens."
Advice,fjxl3fq,t3_ffcoqa,1583676824.0,"Take your daughter and bolt. Being a single dad is hard esp. at the toddler stage but they get bigger and it gets easier. Maybe she’ll change, maybe she won’t. Some parts of your gf remind me of me and I never changed until the people I loved the most left. Sometimes people just need a wake up call."
dating_advice,fjpnxkt,t3_feq4t7,1583556017.0,"If being in a relationship is something you want with her I would have a conversation about it to see how she feels about it. Maybe if she doesn’t want it now, ask her if she sees a future with you, or if she’d want to get together any time soon. If she responds kind of flaky, or straight up says no I think you have your answer on what you feel you should be able to do. Just let her know your if going to be taking up any other partners cause safety ya know. I think if you’re not really with someone and they have no plans to be with you then you have every right to go out and seek other ventures."
AskReddit,fjo9pzb,t3_fei0pi,1583523404.0,Mom told me putting a magnet to a tv would mess it up. Idk why but it sounded like fake news to 6 year old me. Long story short mom woke up to a tv with a giant green blotch over the screen. Luckily it went away.
Advice,fjo9bzw,t3_fei17q,1583523180.0,"I’m so sorry you had to go through something like that, it shouldn’t have even happened in the first place. I understand the self harm thing, I’ve been deemed mentally incompetent for them even though I stopped years ago and it’s incredibly frustrating. You would think your mother would be incredibly understanding considering she went through the same thing, but I guess all people cope differently. I understand not wanting to cut your mother off, but if you explained yourself over and over again and she still is insistent on you seeing a relationship happens, I think it goes to show that it’s like beating a dead horse. If someone can’t understand the reasoning behind your trauma and how you choose to deal with it, I think it’s time to maybe think if it’s someone you really want in your life. Even if you chose to not cut ties maybe take a big step back, or revisit the ultimatum of her not seeing her grandchild, which seems perfectly fair to me. It may become easier to cut ties the more you form your own healthy happy family as well. It’s harder to move on when you’ve got something or some one trying to re open that old wound, and I would’ve called it quits after the party incident but I know it’s not that easy what so ever and I haven’t been in your shoes so I can’t totally say. All I can say is I hope you make the steps you can do to move on and heal, and hopefully close the book on that chapter of your life the best you can, however you have to do so."
