schizophrenia,fji26aq,t3_fdefga,1583359339.0,"I have been diagnosed with PTSD in addition to bipolar depression and/or depression with psychosis (it fluctuates). We do talk about the psychosis trauma a little in therapy. I'm glad my therapist and psychiatrist are progressive enough to support the idea that psychosis can cause PTSD. I think there is research into it but maybe not a lot. It can go both ways. You can have trauma-induced psychosis, or psychosis-induced trauma. PTSD and psychosis are two sides of the same coin.

I believe that the body cannot tell the difference between real or psychotic experiences and still perceives it real since the fear is so intense. Intense periods of this fear state leave a mark on the mind. The abject horror of some of these hallucinations/experiences are totally scarring. I watched this horror movie Session 9, takes place in a mental asylum, and the next day I was having flashbacks to being hospitalized. I also experienced physically visceral rape-like encounters with what felt like, to me at the time, demonic forces. Experiencing psychosis felt like being tortured at times. You know, it's the kind of thing you even wouldn't wish on your worst enemy."

Psychosis,ewgrpwv,t1_ewgrdgu,1565388848.0,"I've done something similar - written myself into a psychotic state because I'd start believing what I was remembering.

It's hard to make friends in patient. I've only kept a few of them. They never really last because we're all so fucked up. Don't pay attention to what was said about you. I heard shit said about me being ""dangerous"" or ""crazy, stay away from her"" amongst other patients even though I did nothing dangerous on the unit. 

I hope you find a good therapist!"
Psychosis,ewgr6i5,t3_cnx4ha,1565388466.0,"I've had very strange experiences/delusions that have been confirmed. By more than one person. And I tell my therapist this but she kind of just shrugs it off. One of them I have proof of from a poem. The poem was about a high profile person I thought I was telepathic with telling me he was dying; he told me so ""telepathically"" (we weren't actually in correspondence in person, I was just a fan) A year later he died. He hadn't told anyone he had cancer and was going to die. Since he was high profile it was a shock to everyone. I was shocked because I didn't know how I knew; I had already at that point thought I was just delusional and then all of a sudden the delusion was confirmed. 

The other was that a specific spirit, the spirit of the high profile person who died, was in contact with me and a friend confirmed it because that spirit contacted him and apparently told him it was real. Another friend said she saw the spirit in a vision, basically confirming to her that yes, I was in contact with the spirit. She has also had shared hallucinations.

I had a roommate once who had the same dream as me about aliens and shit. Stuff like a hovering football-size hovership with ""US ARMY"" marked on it or something. 

Oftentimes it IS those creepy shared delusions/hallucinations with other people that trigger me the most into believing this shit is real!

I've had psychics tell me I have ""the gift"" and I've had people tell me this high profile person is my ""spirit guide."" 

But the thing is, I've learned is that my ability to articulate my delusions and hallucinations, sometimes people get this feeling that it's real --- if they are particularly spiritually inclined or believe in a lot of woo. I guess I'm convincing. But my hard evidence (a blog post from 2015 about the guy dying, who died in 2016) still makes me feel weird."
Psychosis,ewgqgxk,t3_co5cye,1565387958.0,"I've heard of people who have, and I certainly wanted to be one of them, but after fifteen years of dealing with this, I've come to accept I still need medications. There have been times in my life where I was off and fine, but because I have a combo of PTSD/bipolar/psychotic symptoms, on top of life stressors (very poor) it tends to come back due to stress. So I've accepted that I need meds. Like maybe one day I'll be okay without them but I handle stress so poorly I need help."
Psychosis,ewgq9wn,t3_co4s8d,1565387822.0,"Yes. I've had that kind of psychosis and it's like a combination of mania and psychotic symptoms for me. I feel wonderful, like I'm capable of anything I set my mind to - I feel grateful, I feel like everything and everyone is beautiful, I feel connected to the universe. In other words, euphoric. However, oftentimes this euphoria can flip, for me, and turn into paranoia, anxiety, dissociation, and I start slipping. 

But yeah, if you're getting the idea that it's all supposed to be scary, nah. Part of why people don't take their meds, is that it can sometimes feel good. I know sometimes I miss the highs of the euphoric state and even want it."
Psychosis,ewgq1dm,t3_co4ys0,1565387656.0,"I've actually had paradoxical reactions to antipsychotics too. Some psychs are too dumb to realize paradoxical reactions can occur. Just tell her you want a different med b/c you think it's making you worse. If she doesn't listen to you, honestly she's not doing her job right. She can't prove that lurasidone was helping you. Psych meds are a mystery like that.

Being on Latuda/lurasidone made me SUICIDAL. And I actually attempted because the psychiatrist at the time wouldn't let me leave the hospital unless I took it. I attempted after leaving the hospital. I think Latuda is being pushed because it's new right now TBH. 

Risperdal did help with psychosis for me but it made me an overweight unfeeling zombie. 

I just started Vraylar (also for bipolar/psychosis) and it's been mildly effective so far (been a week). 

It may be that the delusional state hasn't worn off yet for you. I remember getting better from my first episode of psychosis and still having nights here and there of it. If it's already started going away it'll probably keep going away, just hold on for when those nights come back. I don't think meds are necessarily an off-on switch for psychosis but work around the psychosis, massaging it away.

I hope the best for you."
Psychosis,ewgpg9l,t3_co8mwr,1565387248.0,"Does her insurance support a partial hospitalization? Most in-patient experiences I've had are followed by a partial hospitalization which is like group therapy, or as I like to put it ""Daycare for Adults."" 

She can meet other people who are similar to her. Last time I went, which was actually last week, there were a number of people who were refusing to take meds mixed in with people who did. Sometimes being around people in the same boat can help ease her into the idea of taking meds. But also maybe she's not on the right meds and they're just hurting her (I know my meds have made me worse). 

But getting her to go to partial might be a challenge too. It's really for the group therapy aspect. You just go to the group therapy programs which last from morning to afternoon and then go home. They go over self-care, medications, etc."
Psychosis,ewgp4o3,t3_co8p3h,1565387026.0,"I feel this. I'm so sorry this all happened to you. You're not alone. I feel that anger. I feel that grief and loneliness. You are a good writer too. 

Does writing help you? I remember some things and sometimes try to write them down. It can help but only if I write about it with a certain literary aesthetic that pleases me (I have a high standard for my own personal writing). 

Some of my experiences mirror yours. I was once grabbed by a security guard watching over me in an emergency room because I took a photo of him and it pissed him off. He threw me (29f at the time) on the bed and forced me to delete the photo.

I've also had ideas about the world ending and thought I played a major role in it. I've also been duped into going into the hospital. 

Just spoke to my therapist today about the PTSD that comes along with having psychosis. It was validating because I feel like we don't get treated as if our PTSD matters in general. She said it's quite common to have PTSD from the delusions. I just wish it were taken more seriously.

Just remembering all this stuff is PTSD. Do you have a therapist with which to discuss this stuff? It took me a while to find one that actually kinda gets it, since she works with other people who have had psychosis."
Psychosis,ewgokl2,t3_co3lr0,1565386647.0,"When I was younger, voices told me I was both the anti-christ, moshiach, Jesus reborn, and/or pregnant with any of those. I didn't know what to do, so I decided that to prove my innocence, I'd have to die. I was in the hospital, so I didn't end up dying.

Other times I came up with theories as to why I'd think that way, deciding maybe the anti-christ is also a spirit, like the holy ghost, that fills someone up when they're angry, greedy or lustful. I came up with so many religious theories, I may as well have come up with a new religion. Coincidentally, I found gnosticism actually came close to summing up my religious delusions, but I don't really practice it. 

What do you mean by torture? I definitely have been ""tortured"" before but I am curious as to what it means for you. It's interesting how if you defy them, they torture you."

It's like being immersed in a book; letting go of deciding what's real or not to observe, detach and learn from it. I study the unreal to know what is real."
