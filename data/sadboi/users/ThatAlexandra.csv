nintendo,fomq44w,t3_g7vuf0,1587899762.0,"I’m looking forward to being able to take my grandmother out to the park again so she can enjoy the sunshine and watch the birds. Also being able to see my SO after roughly 6 months of being apart (LDR, had plans to see each other and COVID happened) and seeing my best friend’s new house she and her SO just bought together!"
HumansBeingBros,fnav7la,t1_fnatdrc,1586804399.0,My aunt and I took them some disposable masks we had (my uncle is an exterminator and had quite a few) and made sure we were sanitized and careful. We’ve given them some fruit in the past as well and other things. They’re very sweet and my day’s always brighter when I’m able to say hello before going to work!

cats,fiptt82,t1_fiprori,1582621029.0,"I figured I should have left it unplugged for longer! My boy is generally fierce so it surprised me he freaked out, I’m hoping he’ll come around eventually. Thanks for the advice :)"

wemetonline,f8pp9wt,t3_e1dd24,1574705139.0,"We (22F, 22M) met through a mutual gaming friend on R6 and, after a week or so of just getting to know each other, started dating. A couple of months later I flew (for the first time) up to meet him and stayed for a week. The initial meeting at the airport was a little awkward but we both expected that as we’re introverted and shy. Once we started talking in the car and I made some horrible jokes/puns we eased up and had a great time! It turned out to be one of the best weeks of my life and he’s coming down in May for a week, I can’t wait!"

AskReddit,eztyz2n,t1_ezsw9df,1568141793.0,"Mine happens at least 2-3 times a week, hasn’t changed in the 10+ years I’ve had it, always FP. 

I wake up in snow with hefty winter gear on, but only a compass in hand. I go the same way every time and end up at the same area: north east until I hit what seems to be the ocean. Stand there for a while watching the waves until it’s getting dark, the wind picks up and it starts snowing harder. Start to go back the way I came when I see a large figure a few feet away, at this point I can’t move at all. End up watching an abnormally large polar bear charge and get right into my face before I wake up. 

It used to terrify me as a kid because unlike most of my other dreams it’s very realistic, but I’ve gotten used to it and now only question why I keep having it."
AskReddit,ex6tt6a,t3_crgd6g,1566051350.0,"There are times where I’ll be holding something in either or both of my hands when they suddenly just go limp and kind of numb and I can’t do anything about it. Never stays that way for long, maybe just a minute, and it doesn’t happen in any pattern I’ve noticed nor have I noticed anything causing it."
PCOS,ewy573j,t3_cqmmxw,1565874965.0,"I struggle as well, but with my meds, paleo, and exercise (3/4 times a week) I’ve lost some weight and am able to keep it off as long as I stick with it. It’s different for everyone and healthy can look many different ways! I used to be obsessed with scales and it would only make things harder as I used food for comfort. I figure as long as I’m eating healthy and exercising then I’m healthy."

AskReddit,eu4hm46,t3_cerzhb,1563454158.0,"It depends on the situation and the person imo. My close friends usually pay me back quickly without prompting so I’m never worried. I know a few people that have to be reminded or don’t do well on paying people back, usually I prompt them within 2-4 weeks."

PCOS,erek9bw,t3_c1fhay,1560786189.0,22 and same here! Always struggling with my weight and the extra hair.

Anxiety,epwfmf4,t3_bvxmtt,1559574611.0,"I do this frequently during my day. If I don’t it feels like there’s a weight or pressure building that goes from uncomfortable to unbearable and sighing helps relieve it, whether I do it consciously or not. My close friends and some family know that hardly ever does it mean anything else solely because I talked with them about it after hearing their concerns. I worry about possibly bothering my coworkers or worrying my boss, but if I don’t I end up struggling to focus on my work as the weight/pressure worsens. I’m sorry about your situation, I wouldn’t have really thought sighing could be considered rude."
