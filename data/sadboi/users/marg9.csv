Even when people commit suicide while on them, it's unclear wheather they wouldn't have done so anyway, because antidepressants get prescribed to depressed people who have those tendencies to begin with.

There are also pros & cons to MDMA, but if anything is true, it's that it shouldn't be used long term. That's why I suggested antidepressants as a possibility, because they can, not because they are inherently good."

Seeing that you found a rarely used antidepressant through genetic testing made me think... I'm under impression that psychiatrist in my town (or country) have a certain algorithm when prescribing them. E.g. I went to 4 different psychiatrists and every time I was prescribed either Lexapro or Cymbalta, plus Xanax. I guess that was because I'm classified as having somatic symptoms and Cymbalta is good for that. Even when I complained about not having the best time on Lexapro and getting dependant on Xanax, I still got prescribed the same thing! It's crazy.

I'm lucky to now have a psychiatrist who's willing to try things out and not force a specific antidepressant or anti-anxiety meds, but there's still an issue of doctors not knowing about *all* possible antidepressants. I mean, what if clomipramine was good for me too, but nobody knows about it and nobody's ever used it. That's why genetic testing could be great: to identify which antidepressant could be beneficial even if a doctor's never used it. Having results of a test, a doctor/psychiatrist would probably be willing to prescribe it, because he could support his choice with a test, even if he/she did not believe in it.

Which genetic testing did you take, btw?"

I used to take CBD oil and smoke some CBD buds, but here's my issue with not just it but any supplement or a drug that actually works and is not prescribed by your doctor: You simply do not know whether you're getting better because od antidepressant or a side drug.

Example:
While taking Lexapro, I took benzos every day to cope with increased anxiety and smoked CBD daily to make my mood better. It really did work, however what I should have done is realize that Lexapro didn't work very well and that I should have changed to other meds sooner!

I think the main issue in my case is getting prescribed anything that isn't a modern antidepressant, because it seems to me that psychiatrist here follow a certain algorithm which simply does not include older antidepressants. I think the best would be to find a psychiatrist who's old enough to know these things.

My sleep is usually poor and that's partly a reason why I'm on antidepressant; it seems to improve my sleep a lot. However, if I get chronically sleep deprived for several days in a row or if I oversleep trying to compensate for that, sometimes I get bad depersonalization. And the worst is actually the oversleeping (you know that feeling when you want to get as much sleep as possible but wake up feeling even worse). So... yeah, I can see how sleep can affect that. I mean, most of people experience the fogginess etc. associated with too little or too much sleep, they just don't dissociate and that was true for me too before I started getting these DPDR 'attacks'.

Regarding weed, I was a quite heavy smoker for half my life but I quit 4 years ago because of depersonalization issues and feeling ""out of it"". At the time, I probably didn't know it was DPDR, I thought that it's ""making me feel insane"" lol. That and paranoia which got really out of hand.

antidepressants,fktrhgk,t3_fjfqiw,1584532193.0,"Alright, here's my take on the situation. Without antidepressants, I theoretically could feel much more joy and happines, but it was always overshadowed by this dark cloud of darkness and fatigue in the background. It would last like 10 seconds until I'd feel shitty again. With antidepressants I admit I couldn't achieve like 100% happines, but my *overall* mood was good, and it would actually last. In other words, there was much more sustained hapiness.

So I understand the temptation to be all woeful about it, but ultimatively what happens is this: When not taking antidepressant, you have the *potential* to be much happier than when taking them, but being depressed means that you never fully achieve this potential, and actually spend 90% of time feeling neutral or bad. Being on antidepressants, your happiness potential is a little bit lower, but your utilization of it is way greater. Mathematically speaking, [""area under the curve""](https://www.graphpad.com/guides/prism/7/statistics/stat_area_under_the_curve.htm) of happines is much greater, even though peaks are flattened.

Personally, even though I theoretically might not have been able to achive ""100% happiness"", I felt rather good in a sense of enyojing life, hobbies, hanging out with people etc. and didn't care much about it. There was this other quality of *sustained happiness* that I found much more important, and this was what I was constantly lacking. So, antidepressants in my case brought much to the table, and had taken away only a bit.

Another related phenomenom is having difficulties with sexual arousal while on antidepressants. Again, one might complain that before antidepressants one  could *get it up* way easier and now it's become difficult, but lets be honest; is there anybody who is seriously depressed but has a great sexual life? Being depressed by definition means lack of enjoyment of things. So let's cut this bullshit and admit that these things are only *theoretical concerns*. In practice, what happens is that a depressed individual feels shitty to his/her core, and that being on antidepressant is better than doing nothing, because doing nothing in remaining depressed which kills all the fun and joy in things, if not making one straight up suicidal. Alright, one might never achieve their *imagined 100% hapiness*, but what one can do is *improve* things by taking an antidepressant, and work on changing their beliefs in order to accept that life isn't all sunshine and roses and maybe start to apply some gratitute to their life.

Sorry for the long *rant*, but I think this is the most truthful answer, and if one can't accept it, it's their issue and they need to work on it, mainly on realizing life isn't all sunshine and roses."

In my opinion, not getting good sleep is the worst becauce it screws everything else, so it was better to be drowsy during the day.

Buspirone seems to be an interesting medication. It works but nobody knows how. Well, I wouldn't say that we know exactly how ordinary medications (such as SSRIs) work, but at least there are some good theories.

> Withdrawals while moving off a medication, and starting new ones can literally put your ass down for weeks at a time. It's really, really awful. But once things settle down it's easier to determine what's happening. It took me many many medications and years to find the right drug. It's an unfortunate lottery you get stuck playing until you finally win. But when you do win, and the fog clears...I swear it's worth all the pain all over again.

Yeah, exactly, it can be horrendous. I mean, before stopping the last meds, I was starting to play in band, did some traveling, had a partial time job etc, but after I stopped I was literally ""out of it"" for like 6 weeks. And the trouble is, you get used to feeling a certain way (better, preferably), and when you stop meds, it all changes so suddenly that you don't recognize yourself anymore and everything you were doing up to that point goes through the window. Even when I first got better on antidepressant for the first time in years, I felt weird because I got used to not going out and being a kind of recluse.

If that doesn't help you, I'm sorry, but I have nothing better to offer. I'm sure a psychologist would suggest a similar line of thinking in order to counterbalance the negativity.

However, this does not mean I will never take an antibiotic again or become an activist against them. (I won't take the one that might have f\*\*\*\*d me up, that's for sure.)

You can think of it this way: Doing anything is risky, including taking medication, but also don't nothing is also risky because who knows what might happen if you don't act and treat your condition.  It applies to anything in life. Say that you got yourself a car and get wrecked in your first ride. That's basically what happened, and that indeed happens for some people. I honestly suggest you contemplate this and realize that on deeper level, and try to keep a realistic perspective. I know you're resentful right now, and that's all right. I wish the best for you in the future and that you find some relief. Who knows, it might go away on it's own. I mean, it happened for me (partially), though it took like 3 years for that. Best wishes"
mentalhealth,fkjvxo7,t1_fkjk6fa,1584262141.0,"I took multiple antibiotics over the course of a couple years. It was a recurrent infection, in a sense that it would come back (not necessairly the same bacteria). So I guess I took probably like 5 diferent antibiotics, and of of them was Ciprofloxacin, which has been linked to some sort of nerve damage (you can google it if you want to find out more, there is enough information online).

It's very hard for me to tell if it's because of antibiotic or not, because I believe I also developed some kind of depression, but the fact remains that I had a recurrent UTI, took lots of antibiotics, and after that something got screwed up. Doctors don't really believe it has anything to do with antibiotics though one of them mentioned it (that's how I found out), be he said it should have already resolved itself if it was that. So basically I'm left with a diagnosis of Anxious depression and Somatoform disorder. I do not deny that I have depression and anxiety, but I find it quite unbelievable that numbness in my hands and feet or trouble with fine movements could be a result of depression, in a sense that my mind is creating it. That's what's really absurd. Other symptoms could be due to depression. Well, it is what it is, and I've made my peace with the fact that some things will remain a mystery, now the only thing I hope is that I get some relief with medication and that it brings me back to some sort of acceptable state.

This is a kinda long answer to a simple question, but it is the most trutful one."
mentalhealth,fki00mm,t1_fkhzjrn,1584209179.0,"Well I ""gave up"" half a year ago, and went to a psychiatrist asking to be treated for depression because I couldn't take it anymore, started taking an antidepressant, and discovered that I actually felt way better for the first time in years. :-)

It's been like 4-5 years, most of which I spent getting all kinds of medical tests, to no avail. During that time I worked a partial time job, had a girlfriend, did some socializing etc. but I always felt way too tired and shitty, as if I was operating at 30% of my potential. So, my life is not totally ruined, but it's not good either.

Actually, the reason I had to move in with my parents (a month ago) is because antidepressants and benzos screwed me up while going off of them. My doctor got me addicted to benzos but doesn not want to admit to that. Basically, both starting and going off antidepressants makes me even more disabled for a limited period of time.

antidepressants,fkh93ab,t1_fkh754b,1584192609.0,"No problem, I'm glad I could help. :)

I wish I knew some of these things before. I think the biggest problem is that doctors simply give you these pills and tell you to take it as if they were sugar pills. (Ok, it's not like that all the time but very often it is.) Then all kind of crazy shit starts to happen and you don't know what to do and why it happens. It's a difficult situation to be in. Nobody tells you anything and you have to figure out everything the hard way. I mean, if you're depressed or anxious, the last thing you need is to get even more messed up by meds... I'd say it's almost ""malpractice"" on their side. 

I don't want to go ranting but it's true...

Wish you the best, hope things get and stay better :)"
antidepressants,fkh6vx4,t1_fkh4smp,1584190637.0,"I'm not a doctor, but something smilar happened to me when I was taking Lexapro and when I upped the dose from 5 to 10mg. I was supposed to start with 5mg, I had side effects but things calmed down and it was working, and after a month my doctor told me to up the dose to 10mg which is ""standard dose"" for depression I guess, and then I became very confused and out of it and I couldn't shake the feeling. I went back to 5mg, and felt fine again.

So it's highly possible that the dose is too much for you. I'd say your lucky because you recognized you did well on one pill a day. (You probably went from 30 to 60mg.) I say you go back to one pill a day if that was fine to you.

See, the thing is, not everybody has the same metabolism and some people are better metabolizers of certain drugs than other people, so for those whole metabolize the drug faster, a higher dose is needed, and vise versa. Of course there might be other things going on but this is just an example. The point is that you don't need to feel like you haven't gone to the ""full"" dose so it wont work properly. It's not the case. You should find the dose that is the best for you. Any reasonable psychiatrist should know this. I think this is the greatest trouble with antidepressants that people have, because the algorithm is start with dose X and up to dose Y after a week, as if it were a solid fact that applies to everybody. That's why it's important to be monitored during the psychiatrist to that he/she can determine what's best for you.

Edit: My thing with Wellbutrin, I was already on the lowest possible dose and it really didn't feel right."
askpsychology,fkh2e02,t1_fkgzr6d,1584185867.0,"Thank you for very detailed answer. :)

I'm actually diagnosed F41.2 and F45. I had a history of health complaints where medical examination has found nothing wrong with me (no organic cause), but of course you couldn't know that.

&#x200B;

>If I had a patient in front of me with all of these ""diagnoses"" I'd agree with you and probably assume a coherent theme. I would try to understand which symptom is the most pressing one and if maybe one of them causes the others - because that is actually quite common with anxiety for example.

I agree, I often felt that my main problem is depression and bodily symptoms (e.g. fatigue, pains), and it's anxiety that's running wild and is feeding all these health worries and obsessive thoughts and behaviours. It's very much about the feeling of losing control. So, I'm *not really* a hypohondriac because I don't worry about all kinds of potential health issues or have OCD because most of my obsessiveness is localized to this specific issue that I'm having, and is actually more of an generalized anxiety than anything else. If I got that right.

So I get what you want to say. Actually these diagnoses contain in themselves a common theme and a primary pathology, it's not just a ""stack"" of unrelated things.

And I don't want to make this about me. I want to be clear that I'm not seeking an diagnosis, because I already have one and I think it's fine, and I'm going to theraphy and taking medication. So everything's all right.

What bothered me is that these ""modern"" diagnosis are somehow excluding the totality (a big picture) of what's wrong with me, and now I see that's not the case, it actually all makes sense. It was more of an academic question anyway, because what matters to me is that my therapist is understanding the big picture (she is) and that in the future I don't get like a stack of diagnoses that would make me seem batshit crazy. :-P Now I'm confident that won't happen.

Thanks again for a very detailed answer, I really appreciate the time taken on your part. Now I can finally see why my diagnosis is actually better than just being diagnosed ""neurosis"", even though at first it seemed as if there were a lot of things being excluded from it."

Exactly. That's why I say there isn't any true nihilist. All people have some sort of drive to meaning, I think it's innate. It's incredibly naive to think nihilism actually works in practice.

I was a nihilist for quite some time. It was extremely depressing. Now I'm actively giving up that position because it against human nature, in my opinion. I'm more of an existentialist now, if I had to classify myself."

So yeah, interpretations vary.

I wonder if this is some kind of *implicit peer pressure thing*, in a sense that I beat myself with a stick because I'm not having the *appropriate* or *expected* emotional response. Say that a close person dies, and I'm not crying (because the person was long ill and I made peace).

askpsychology,fkgx86l,t1_fkbpwyw,1584178805.0,">Many people don’t want to think deeply. It scares them. They’re unsure how they’re going to handle the unknown if anything “weird” comes up. If they have a relatively closed world, strict routine, small group of family and/or friends who think like them, they don’t see a need to challenge preconceived notions. People typically only want to do introspective work when faced with an extreme psychological challenge, like unexpected death or marital betrayal. But lacking this, most people are content to coast along with the head down and not think about anything deeply. They’re comfortable here. They don’t want to change and of course, you can’t make someone want to change if they don’t want to.

This is what bothers me about my father, just to name an example. His health is failing and he continues to smoke copious amount of tobbaco even though he coughs and has COPD. It's insane, it's as if he wants to be dead as soon as soon as possible. No matter what I say about how dangerous this whole situation is, he seems to be stuck in this *precontemplative* state of (non-)change. It's like, he will acknowledge that smoking is bad for him etc., but there's no real *awareness* of that. I'm out of my wits, I just don't know how to make him snap out of this state of denial which is getting so horrible that it borders on delusion.

So, how the hell does one motivate a person to at least *think* about the reality of the situation?"
