Two reasons why the whole thing is made up. 1. Lying about the death rate or at least getting the calculations wrong. 2. Why would a doctor list oil companies failing as a reason to end lockdown. 

Not posting links but they are easily accessible and within acceptable time frames. They included the CDC, ABS, newspapers and worldometer.com.

Numbers are best approximations. 

Take away point is that without lockdown the numbers skyrocket. 

Reason for doing this: found out a friend has been brainwashed by anti-vax conspiracy nuts.

I hate having people like you in my team. Because you don't change anything. You don't put pressure on them, you don't get objectives, and it means I'm playing against them effectively with one less player on my team. It makes it harder for me. 

You need to pick up an automatic and get in the fight. You win by holding more ground, putting pressure on, stopping them from g3tting your team mates, stopping them from g3tting objectives. 

Your attitude stops you from getting better because you think your good but your not. KD means nothing if your team loses. Your attitude stops you saying hey I think I need to change the way i play. Instead you just keep doing the same thing, keep losing, and keep blaming your team mates for it."

I also had the convo at 1am after drinking and I think I did a pretty good job. 

Just because there are no studies that talk about it doesn't mean it's not true. There's no studies that show country wide lockdowns helped our cause because it's never been done before.

Coronavirus,fonob8k,t1_fonc183,1587923290.0,I'm sorry dude but it makes perfect sense. If you can't understand it then that's your problem. I can't think of a more simpler way describe it. You being a health professional ( remembering physiotherapist are health professionals) doesn't mean anything. I've studied nursing and it sickens me to see the incompetent people who are going pass without actually knowing anything.
Coronavirus,fonnauq,t1_fondnfj,1587922755.0,"I thought you were arguing that the death rate is worse than what they are saying. Because you have just argued against that. 


If people are ""seeking out the test"" i think it's fair to say that it is because they have symptoms that make them think they might have it, which then makes it more likely to have positive results. So the real figures (across a wider population) would actually be lower. 


California is a diverse place. It has many different types of people and as far as I'm concerned is a fair representation of the average American person. If anything from what I have heard, it's not the richest part of America, meaning they have more negative leaning health determinants. So the real figures when averaging with a healthier population again would be lower.

Also infection rates aren't the issue. The issue is people getting sick enough that they need hospitalization. It's fine if everyone gets infected but doesn't get sick. 

Finally, the early predictions (without much data) were that the death rate would he high. But these guys are saying that the data now doesn't show that. Even without predicting future events it is significant. Every time you get new data, you add it to the pile and average it out. Even if you don't agree with me, the data they have is bringing the average down."
Coronavirus,fon5xzu,t1_fon40go,1587912954.0,"Well refer to what I just said and think about what happened when colonizers of America and Australia and Africa meet with the native people. The natives were wiped out from diseases that they had never encountered before. That's an extreme example but it's the same thing. 

If your out and about your getting these little doses throughout the day and your body can cope. If you isolate for an extended period of time, the amount of foreign agents that you haven't been exposed to accumulates. When it gets to a large enough amount of new agents then it overloads your ability to fight them all off at once. Then you get sick. 

And calling it bullshit fear mongering when you haven't even taken the time to learn about it yourself isn't the way to learn. Because you will always see it from a biased perspective."

Coronavirus,fon28z9,t1_fomwvk4,1587910527.0,"They were mostly referring to children but it still applies somewhat to adults. Look up the ""hygiene hypothesis"".

For people in general, everyone is covered in bacteria and other things on every surface of your body. Inside and out. Everyone actually has a unique bacteria profile that is the equivalent of a finger print.

 What they are saying is, that bacteria is good because it has control of the resources and competes with any new bacteria that lands on you. That way you get a small dose to make antibodies and the new bacteria is killed off before it can colonise and make you sick.

When you use disinfectants and detergents you remove some of the good bacteria that is on your skin. That means that when a new bacteria/virus lands on you, there's no competition for resources. This means the virus can reproduce, colonize and make you sick before you can produce enough antibodies to kill it off. 

Also, sorry if my other comment came across too strong. It was just too easy to pass up."
Coronavirus,fon0t9h,t1_fomvsrk,1587909503.0,I get what you are saying. I will have to watch it again. The thing is your example of 100 people getting tested is not fair.

I can't remember what it's called but there is an accepted limit for these things and it's not as high as you would think. Its used for everything from marketing to tv ratings to medication.
