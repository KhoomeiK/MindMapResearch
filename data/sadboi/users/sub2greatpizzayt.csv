SuicideWatch,fjzxsyq,t3_ffmo3f,1583733176.0,"I dont have regular teenager problems but I dont find that a problem. I rather be miserable wanting to kms at home getting high then being miserable about some shitty test or having fake friends. I don‚Äôt have to do anything my mom dont care about me so it has its downs and ups. I have different types of problems then all my friends but it seems easier. For example I have no food at my house ever, lets say one of my friends has a break up. It seems so much easier to get over my problem and it seems like a lot less stress. Life for me us never serious it seems like there‚Äôs nothing taboo to me. If anyone asks I will tell them anything like imma kms on Friday. Idk if this is better than high school problems but I prefer it.
