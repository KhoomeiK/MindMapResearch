I work in mental health and I just want to address some lapses in language I’ve been seeing in other responses:

BPD is not more “common” in women- BPD is more commonly DIAGNOSED in women.

Misdiagnoses due to societal stigma and social gender expectations, means that more women are diagnosed with BPD; and more men are diagnosed with ASPD. This misdiagnosis/stigma also means that lots of men (who should be diagnosed BPD) end up in the prison system.

It doesn’t mean one gender is more likely to “have” that mental illness over another- it is simply a difference in DIAGNOSIS from societal stigma and gendered expectations.

It’s a bit of a specific language check, but I just wanted to respond to that.

It sucks that this happened- I am sending love 💛"

BPD,fmopun5,t1_fmohvkz,1586265842.0,"1) Yes, diagnosed. I was diagnosed 2 years ago, got better, but have steadily relapsed since October last year. Since January I’ve been:
- seeing my psychologist every 1-2 weeks
- seeing psychiatrist once a month
- started on quetiapine (antipsychotic) and increased sertraline (ssri?) which both really help
- started on a 3 month DBT program which is the precursor to a 6 month DBT program!

So I definitely feel much better than I did before, but of course it’s still early days. The DBT program really is helping, though, and I’m learning a lot (and applying it)

I have done a better job now of standing on my own 2 feet than before- but yeah, early days.

When I was 14, just starting to go through puberty etc, my weight and food intake was heavily monitored and mocked, and nobody had noticed that I had been developing (very obvious) signs of an anxiety disorder. I also didn’t even evaluate whether or not I wanted to be in the sport, because it was engrained subconsciously very early on, that that was my life. Nobody asked me whether or not I still wanted to do the sport, or if I even liked it.

So, you’re NOT THE ASSHOLE.

Australian Indigenous history consists of the “assimilation” policy, aka “breeding out” the Australian Aboriginal race in 3 generations. This consisted of the erasure of cultural identity through assimilation with white Australians.

So I see what you’re trying to say, and I also agree with the original tweet. Colonial ideas (at least in Australia) actively perpetuate the belief that culture and genes CAN be “bred out”....... but we mixed POC know that’s not true, just as contemporary Australian Indigenous communities know that very well too!"

Yes, we need more focus on awareness and education.

There was also (and idk if it still happens around here since I’ve distanced myself for quite a while) this mindset of blaming Asian women for marrying white men. This criticism is justified when it’s for obvious reasons eg AF against AM, halfie men etc- that’s justified. What I’m talking about is the social circumstances that influenced some AF in marrying WM.
