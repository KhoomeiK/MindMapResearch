1.  Thank you. Things have been fucking messy, but I’ve hit rock bottom and I think I need to try therapy at this point because I’m hurting everyone around me and it’s scaring me. 

2. We broke up. I think the whole gay thing was her trying to adapt by thinking “it wasn’t that bad for you, right?” Though I ended up with two broken ribs and awful injuries, I took a lot of offense to it.  

I just wanted to say Thank you for the support. I’ve been doubted and treated like shit by some police, people that found out both online and in real life and I wanted to tell you that you and everyone that commented on here with these messages were a big reason why I got through these shitty nights feeling like death was a better solution, so thank you. You give me hope that humanity isn’t as awful as I’ve been thinking it was lately."

this whole shitty situation was a result of my dad being involved in some messed up stuff, this was their way of getting through to him. I don’t know they couldn’t have just killed me or cut off an arm, it felt personal. It lasted hours. I wish I had the answers to stop people and police from doubting me, but at least now they’re caught so I don’t have to do the overthinking part and leave it to shit police. 
I can’t answer for why they let my girlfriend (ex now) watch.

They put stuff over our mouths, but there was a lot of noise. Neighbors said they heard nothing that night, which I guess makes sense since our apartments our next to each other and with yards separating."
