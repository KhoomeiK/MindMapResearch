AmItheAsshole,fpjk1w7,t1_fpjf11a,1588671439.0,I don‚Äôt think there was an actual paternity test if this is real. I think she was covering her ass. Like if she got pregnant from another guy and her cheating came out she could say ‚Äúno no the children are yours remember your paternity test‚Äù to keep him to pay for the kids existence. She‚Äôs many things but she ain‚Äôt dumb
MamaJuneFromNotToHot,fp9k9j9,t3_gbs8ae,1588428317.0,Josh and pumpkin care so much about this kid. They do such a good job raising her. This isn‚Äôt their job. They are young and where equipped to only raise a daughter who is a baby. And now they have a baby and an 13 year old who is defiant and going through abandonment. Jennifer doesn‚Äôt want this child she wants the money the child comes with and it‚Äôs so fucked up. Alana needs to stay with josh and pumpkin they are the best parental roles for her. They busy their asses for her when they didn‚Äôt have to which shows how much they care for her
MamaJuneFromNotToHot,fp9gnc5,t3_gc6b94,1588425674.0,Jennifer wants to be the next June point blank. She doesn‚Äôt take Alanas feelings for consideration. She talks shit on June in a way to make herself seem better to Alana. Pumpkin and josh are doing a way better job than sugar bear and Jennifer will ever be able to do with Alana I‚Äôm sorry. This whole you need your child back is stupid because Alana doesn‚Äôt have a good relationship with sugar bear anyway and to take her away from two people she has a good relationship with for what?? Attention and being in the spotlight?? She‚Äôs such a major bitch
MamaJuneFromNotToHot,fo1ufnj,t3_g4u6vs,1587441741.0,Y‚Äôall I‚Äôm really about to buy one of these. I don‚Äôt wanna support her habit but idk these videos?? I want one

bipolar2,fmm1cul,t3_fs0pf8,1586196973.0,I was on it for over 2 years. I recently went off because it started to effect my blood sugars and made me gain 50 ish pounds. Make sure you are in constant contact with your doctor and blood tests to make sure your body is processing it okay. It was my miracle drug for 2 years if it didn‚Äôt effect my sugars I would still be on it. The sleep thing is common that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs usually supposed to be taken at night. I‚Äôm now on lamictal 200 and it is now my new miracle. Keep in contact with your doctor and good luck!
actuallesbians,fmjzvti,t3_fvgbc8,1586141231.0,I‚Äôm sending this to my girlfriend.  She found her dream of a femme top üòÇ

ptsd,fky34bk,t3_fl1ecl,1584640476.0,I have blocked out so much trauma and when I have flashbacks I get confused because I don‚Äôt remember it happening?? So I feel like I‚Äôm making it up but I have confirmation from the actors in my  trauma but still it doesn‚Äôt feel real at all
MamaJuneFromNotToHot,fky0bop,t3_flcevk,1584638911.0,Watching Alana he so upset breaks my heart. What she has done to this poor child is inexcusable. This child is 14 years old and having to watch her mom chose drugs and a man over her. The emotional trauma this poor girl is going through. Pumpkin has stepped up to the plate in ways she shouldn‚Äôt at her age: the fact that June doesn‚Äôt care about her children because of this man shows how abusive truly is. What she did to Jessica is absolutely terrible and it shows how despicable she is that she treats all her daughters like this.
antiMLM,fj5s1xx,t3_fbcchw,1583041191.0,THIS HAPPENED TO ME TOO. My ex friend told me it was a makeover and I found myself in this girls kitchen putting on shitty makeup that didn‚Äôt even blend. I‚Äôve never seen something like that in my life she was like ‚Äúwow it looks so good‚Äù spoiler alert it didn‚Äôt. She made me buy something so I got an eye primer and my whole face broke out the next day. She still keeps texting me to buy stuff. And to this very day I keep ignoring her because one MLMs suck but two I can get morphe makeup for cheaper and 100% better quality. I will never fall for another makeover from a friend. ALSO THIS BITCHED WANTED TO JOIN MARY KAY AND I TOLD HER NO WATCH THIS GIRL ACTUALLY DO IT AFTER WE STOPPED TALKING

fuckeatingdisorders,ex1d5mo,t3_cqwk0u,1565939959.0,I think I have myself emetophobia by purging for years because I absolutely will not throw up in any sense and will avoid it at all costs and thought I was just weird. But I don‚Äôt know if it would be considered an eating disorder in your case But possibly. Due to the fact that you are essentially not eating and restricting all so you don‚Äôt throw up and that seems like the start of an eating disorder
AskReddit,ex1cru4,t3_cqx1hs,1565939514.0,I couldn‚Äôt drink for awhile because I was in a mental health program. And I just told people that I was slowing down after just turning 21 and found out that I don‚Äôt like to drink and am fine without it

bipolar2,ewttuda,t3_cq0hbo,1565753799.0,I‚Äôve gained so much weight on seroquel at this point it‚Äôs ridiculous because of the cravings for junk that I have. It‚Äôs not that bad but I used to be Bulimic and it was a shit show
TrueCrimeDiscussion,ewt34cq,t3_cprjoa,1565739533.0,‚ÄúNo foul play‚Äù Something happened to this girl this seemed sketchy from the start. The fact that her body was found somewhere they previously searched makes it seem very sketch. Something is being covered up

EatingDisorders,eqveur3,t3_bzl8k8,1560344416.0,I went through the same exact thing a few months ago before I went to Renfrew. Try not to be upset while doing it. Personally I was so upset I think I cried. Just sit them down and say hey I have an eating disorder and my therapist thinks I need a higher level of care. And open up the discussion so they can ask whatever they want. You could also ask your therapist if you can do a family session so she is there while you tell them to get the help you need. I hope everything works out with them and you get the help you deserve üíï
