Looks are deceiving. I‚Äôm so weak now!! All my strength was in my size. We got a new puppy last year and I have to be really careful because he‚Äôs almost knocked me on my ass SO many times. My old boy helps me up and down the stairs like a gentleman... but this little asshole üòÇ"
progresspics,fn6heuk,t1_fn6fmdj,1586699339.0,"I‚Äôm the opposite. I‚Äôm enjoying maintenance. I heard all the horror stories!

My doctor gave me a threshold of 4.4lbs that my weight is allowed to fluctuate but if I hit that number during weekly weigh ins, I have to get back into the diet. 800 calories and those shakes. The thought of going back on them again makes me feel ill. After 15 months of shakes I NEVER want to do that again. It‚Äôs a powerful motivator!! 

His maintenance calories for me was 1600. I adjusted down 100 as I was slowly gaining, as you do because our bodies are holding onto more fluid now during maintenance. 

I just track everything. If a certain food doesn‚Äôt fill me up, then I don‚Äôt deem it worthy ongoing. I had hot cross buns recently and they were an old fav but now they‚Äôre just not dense enough to justify the calories, I prefer a fruit English muffin. Or for breakfast I try and have high protein yoghurt with all bran cereal (like a nana) so I hit my fibre for the day early. 

It‚Äôs all about pre planning, experimenting and cutting out the things that don‚Äôt really bring you joy. I LOVE fruit juice, it‚Äôs my vice. I do not love it enough to waste 200 calories every single day.

I found ways to enjoy everything I love and missed. It just takes a bit of work. 

You also need to weigh every single portion. It‚Äôs a pain but I think it‚Äôs the secret."

Ask for professional help. A dietician will reach you to eat healthy. A weight loss doctor (mine was an endocrinologist) will teach you how to lose weight. If it gets hard make another appointment and ask for more help. There are a few medications on the market that can reduce appetite. It‚Äôs not a miracle cure but it gives us a fighting chance. 


Now in the days of isolation going out for appointments is difficult so what I learnt is CICO (calories in vs calories out) is the ONLY scientific way to lose weight. You google your TDEE put in your stats and you‚Äôve got a guide on what calories you can consume to lose weight. 

Then find the weight loss fad diets or ‚Äúthe tools‚Äù that appeal to you. Keto for instance suppresses hunger. IF - intermittent fasting gives you a specific window a day to eat in and is very helpful for structure.

I used all three together. Counted my calories, kept my carbs low (to suppress appetite) and didn‚Äôt start eating until late because my craving hit at night. 

Those are all my magic tips. It‚Äôs not easy but it can be done!!!"
progresspics,fn6fatw,t1_fn6auoe,1586697698.0,"Congratulations on a strong start!!! 

150 wasn‚Äôt a goal I set, it was my doctors. It‚Äôs healthy BMI. It terrified me!! I never imagined getting there, let alone maintaining it. But prior to antidepressants, this was my natural size, right up until my early 20‚Äôs. I wasn‚Äôt a large kid or teen. 

It‚Äôs a nice size. I feel healthy (I‚Äôm not so it‚Äôs a start!!). Maintenance calories for me being inactive is 1500, so I‚Äôm not all that restricted. The smaller you get the less you get to eat daily and I missed food so much that I now hit my calories every day with the best foods üòÅ

I wish you all the very best! x"

Getting it these days isn‚Äôt much better, the medical community is still behind but at least with the internet and advocacy groups like Emerge we‚Äôre finally in it together. We‚Äôre still fighting the recommended treatment from the fraudulent PACE trial.

I‚Äôm so glad you were able to recover!!! That‚Äôs incredible
and to have a family! It was once my dream üíú

I‚Äôve actually been on so many antibiotics, a few triple doses when I contracted H.Pylori and 8yrs of chronic sinusitis until surgery last year finally cleared that up so I can say I‚Äôve tried that myself and it hadn‚Äôt helped, unfortunately. 

Also the antibiotics they used initially while I was in septic shock killed everything dead. Good and bad bacteria. They didn‚Äôt know what they were fighting so tried everything. 

I really appreciate you sharing your story, did make me rethink that I had been blasted by antibiotics!!

So very glad you‚Äôre well x"

I like to do makeup and use to have to contort to strange angles for photos to hide my weight. Now, it‚Äôs just my face! That‚Äôs one of my favourite parts.

My illness may have made it easier in that I‚Äôm generally isolated so less temptations. I only went out for dinner a handful of times during the diet and took a meal replacement bar and ordered black coffee, made others uncomfortable but became so easy to say no. I enjoyed watching what others were eating and wasn‚Äôt tempted."

I appreciate the suggestion. 

My illness was triggered by septic shock, it‚Äôs not something that diet can generally touch. 

I do have friends within the ME/CFS community that have tried the various diets, including carnivore, from memory it makes us very sick. Because our cells create so little energy of their own, we generally need carbs. I know that sounds ridiculous after I was low carb for 15 months but I was surviving off fat stores. 

I personally struggle to eat a lot of meat, so it really wouldn‚Äôt work for me. The protein part of my Optifast diet was actually the hardest part üòÇ"

progresspics,fn53huq,t1_fn52g5s,1586655043.0,"My weight loss doctor is an endocrinologist.
We used Optifast plus protein but also used medications to help with cravings. I took .6mg Saxenda, 25mg Topamax & Contrave. To get me through the 15 months on 800 calories. He didn‚Äôt recommended introducing exercise until I was at goal weight and moving to a maintenance diet, I was unable to and that‚Äôs okay. I do what I can. 

I also had severe issues with period. At highest weight we could no longer control it. It wouldn‚Äôt stop without medication. I had issues with cysts for years and very heavy flow. 7 days of maternity pad flow. I now have 3-4 day light periods. 

Have a chat with your doctors, chose a low calorie plan and fight!

All the very best xxx"
