Some members of the community are going to end up chronically ill, this will impact them for the rest of their lives. Many will be absolutely fine!! 

This community has something ME/CFS sufferers don’t have though, a voice that people are listening to. So when inevitably it is six months from now and some are still unwell, they will need allies to advocate for science and medicine to keep working, keep fighting and finally make that link as to why some of us who suffer a viral infection never recover.

Mentally so many things change too. I can’t concentrate to read books. I’m not as articulate. I lose my train of thought. I’m forgetful. 

Over the years symptoms change. Now if I push myself too far my body starts to shut down. It begins with slurred speech and a stutter then my arms and legs will stop working. So when I start to not be able to speak, I treat it as a “panic attack” and sedate myself with Valium. I wake up fine."

If she’s in treatment and can feel herself becoming obsessed and codependent, maybe that’s why she’s asking for space? Therapist recommended for her own sanity. That’s rare. 

I can’t really speculate further, the only way you’ll ever know is if she can communicate it with you, which may not be possible."

I’m BPD in remission, we do exist. Medication, therapy and accepting that we need to constantly work on ourselves. It can be done.

You’d end up watching out for every girl on the dance floor and inevitably they’d find one drunk enough by the end of the night, which is why when lights went on you’d grab onto that girl for dear life and reunite her with her friends, while this pervert insists she’s agreed to leave with him, she wants to, he’ll “look after” her.

My doctor gave me a threshold of 4.4lbs that my weight is allowed to fluctuate but if I hit that number during weekly weigh ins, I have to get back into the diet. 800 calories and those shakes. The thought of going back on them again makes me feel ill. After 15 months of shakes I NEVER want to do that again. It’s a powerful motivator!! 

His maintenance calories for me was 1600. I adjusted down 100 as I was slowly gaining, as you do because our bodies are holding onto more fluid now during maintenance. 

I just track everything. If a certain food doesn’t fill me up, then I don’t deem it worthy ongoing. I had hot cross buns recently and they were an old fav but now they’re just not dense enough to justify the calories, I prefer a fruit English muffin. Or for breakfast I try and have high protein yoghurt with all bran cereal (like a nana) so I hit my fibre for the day early. 

It’s all about pre planning, experimenting and cutting out the things that don’t really bring you joy. I LOVE fruit juice, it’s my vice. I do not love it enough to waste 200 calories every single day.

I found ways to enjoy everything I love and missed. It just takes a bit of work. 

You also need to weigh every single portion. It’s a pain but I think it’s the secret."

Ask for professional help. A dietician will reach you to eat healthy. A weight loss doctor (mine was an endocrinologist) will teach you how to lose weight. If it gets hard make another appointment and ask for more help. There are a few medications on the market that can reduce appetite. It’s not a miracle cure but it gives us a fighting chance. 


Now in the days of isolation going out for appointments is difficult so what I learnt is CICO (calories in vs calories out) is the ONLY scientific way to lose weight. You google your TDEE put in your stats and you’ve got a guide on what calories you can consume to lose weight. 

Then find the weight loss fad diets or “the tools” that appeal to you. Keto for instance suppresses hunger. IF - intermittent fasting gives you a specific window a day to eat in and is very helpful for structure.

I used all three together. Counted my calories, kept my carbs low (to suppress appetite) and didn’t start eating until late because my craving hit at night. 

Those are all my magic tips. It’s not easy but it can be done!!!"
progresspics,fn6fatw,t1_fn6auoe,1586697698.0,"Congratulations on a strong start!!! 

150 wasn’t a goal I set, it was my doctors. It’s healthy BMI. It terrified me!! I never imagined getting there, let alone maintaining it. But prior to antidepressants, this was my natural size, right up until my early 20’s. I wasn’t a large kid or teen. 

It’s a nice size. I feel healthy (I’m not so it’s a start!!). Maintenance calories for me being inactive is 1500, so I’m not all that restricted. The smaller you get the less you get to eat daily and I missed food so much that I now hit my calories every day with the best foods 😁

I wish you all the very best! x"

It’s so easy to feel hopeless when you’re unwell. It’s a lot like the hopelessness we’re all feeling through this pandemic. I’ve been there and if I can help by jumping on here every so often, then its my pleasure. 

Massive weight loss is never easy 💙"

Getting it these days isn’t much better, the medical community is still behind but at least with the internet and advocacy groups like Emerge we’re finally in it together. We’re still fighting the recommended treatment from the fraudulent PACE trial.

I’m so glad you were able to recover!!! That’s incredible
and to have a family! It was once my dream 💜

I’ve actually been on so many antibiotics, a few triple doses when I contracted H.Pylori and 8yrs of chronic sinusitis until surgery last year finally cleared that up so I can say I’ve tried that myself and it hadn’t helped, unfortunately. 

Also the antibiotics they used initially while I was in septic shock killed everything dead. Good and bad bacteria. They didn’t know what they were fighting so tried everything. 

I really appreciate you sharing your story, did make me rethink that I had been blasted by antibiotics!!

So very glad you’re well x"

I like to do makeup and use to have to contort to strange angles for photos to hide my weight. Now, it’s just my face! That’s one of my favourite parts.

My illness may have made it easier in that I’m generally isolated so less temptations. I only went out for dinner a handful of times during the diet and took a meal replacement bar and ordered black coffee, made others uncomfortable but became so easy to say no. I enjoyed watching what others were eating and wasn’t tempted."

I appreciate the suggestion. 

My illness was triggered by septic shock, it’s not something that diet can generally touch. 

I do have friends within the ME/CFS community that have tried the various diets, including carnivore, from memory it makes us very sick. Because our cells create so little energy of their own, we generally need carbs. I know that sounds ridiculous after I was low carb for 15 months but I was surviving off fat stores. 

I personally struggle to eat a lot of meat, so it really wouldn’t work for me. The protein part of my Optifast diet was actually the hardest part 😂"

My DMs are always a shit show after posting these. It’s exhausting."
progresspics,fn53huq,t1_fn52g5s,1586655043.0,"My weight loss doctor is an endocrinologist.
We used Optifast plus protein but also used medications to help with cravings. I took .6mg Saxenda, 25mg Topamax & Contrave. To get me through the 15 months on 800 calories. He didn’t recommended introducing exercise until I was at goal weight and moving to a maintenance diet, I was unable to and that’s okay. I do what I can. 

I also had severe issues with period. At highest weight we could no longer control it. It wouldn’t stop without medication. I had issues with cysts for years and very heavy flow. 7 days of maternity pad flow. I now have 3-4 day light periods. 

Have a chat with your doctors, chose a low calorie plan and fight!

All the very best xxx"
