mentalhealth,fq9k9nj,t3_ghl9fy,1589200659.0,"Just wondering, what how does receiving this diagnosis change your life?  
Therapists generally look at root causes and symptoms and (in Australia, at least) will only give a diagnosis if you need it for insurance or welfare purposes..

Remember, therapists aren't in the business to judge you, they have chosen this path because they want to help. in most case therapists will have dealt with some sort of mental issues either personally or have someone very close to them affected.  They get it, and usually chose topics to specialise in. That's why beginning your mental health recovery with a gp is the best idea."
mentalhealth,fq9je6y,t3_ghlvhd,1589199972.0,"Thank you for reaching out. This sort of thing is very hard to talk about, especially when the people around you are not supportive or helpful. Here are some tips, I hope they help. 

ok, firstly therapists are supposed to be empathetic, this is poor practice. 

Secondly, therapy takes years. You won't feel better after one session. I've been in therapy myself for the last 15 or so years and I'm not ""cured"" yet, I just think a bit differently.

you need to find the right supports. your gp is supposed to guide you on this type of thing. if gp's are costly, you can look into a social worker. any country that has welfare should provide you a free social worker. also try help lines or text lines or online counselling."

You need to find the therapies that work for you, which may take several years but just focus on what's going ""right"" for you at the moment, i.e ""i am safe"". Yes, pain is related to mental health- it's the same part of the brain. 

Any job can potentially be manageable. You just need a good occupational therapist that can help you get your workspace to be the best for you.

If you are worried about a supernatural being, do use sage to cleanse the room. Whether it ""works"" or not is not important, it's about convincing the mind that it works- the placebo effect. 

Also, LSD is a teacher. Treat it with respect. Always use a trip sitter to help with comedowns.

&#x200B;

 **Have you been able to keep steady work?** No more than 3 years before breakdowns. I used to work in retail and hospitality.

 The thing that triggered the breakdown in retail was that I used to work front end (which i hated), then got transferred to bakery (which i supposedly sucked at, but in reality some bitch just came back from maternity leave and wanted her job back) and i didn't want to go back on to front end because bakery was fun af. I saw greener grass, I tasted it, only to get shoved back down to the the dried up bullshit again.

The thing that triggered me in hospo was someone was talking about how long they'd been employed at said place and I immediately went into ""holy fuck, i don't want to be stuck here for that long"" and just freaked out. They kept changing my tasks on me, staff kept leaving , my physical/metal health just kept getting worse and I wasn't allowed enough time off so I put in my 2 weeks.

&#x200B;

 **Keep a home or apartment?** Luckily I live with a great person who doesn't mind if rent is a bit late or the place is a mess. 

**Start or finish advanced degrees?**  I have a Diploma in Community Services (Mental Health & A.O.D strain) but my anxiety is so fucky ( for now) that I need to work on that first before attempting to help others. I can't control how much my hands/legs shake, the way I stutter or get stuck on words, and I dissociate like a motherfucker..

But that was in my early thirties. Prior to that I had attempted Programming, Graphic Arts, Veterinary Science,  Child care, music education..and just couldn't complete them even though I thought I was interested in these topics. The main difference was Community Service was done at a TAFE ( or community college) that actually gives a fuck about their students. My main teacher helped me out with my final assessments and I had so much more peer support.

&#x200B;

**Has your ability to be functional in these areas ever been impaired (i.e., homelessness, extended unemployment, unfinished schooling).** 

I have been homeless, kinda, for about 6 months or so. I lived in a hostel and in my car when I couldn't afford the payment. 

**If you found yourself in a difficult situation related to these areas of life, how were you able to make changes?** Therapy. Loads of it. Also, we have a decent welfare system here. I eventually go my own support worker and she helped me navigate through the mess a little bit. Basically she helped find free or cheap services/organisations that helped me with what ever problems I had

 **In general, has your functionality gotten worse or better as you age?**   I think from from teens to early 20's it got ""worse"" because I had less supports. I left home at 17. 

I feel like my ability to concentrate got worse as older. Not sure if burn out related or felt like I wasn't getting praise so I stopped giving a fuck?

I'm also not sure if shits worse at 34 than 20's or I'm just more mindful of it now? Like, I didn't know how bad stuff was until friends and work colleagues told me. So...iunno

&#x200B;

**TLDR;**  Life is so much fucking easier when you have the right supports in place, it has nothing to do with age.  I know we have the tendency to not trust people, but you need to tell yourself that it is literally their job to help people."
