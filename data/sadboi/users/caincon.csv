ThirdWaveFeminism,fr3rkvx,t1_fr3rhgg,1589864350.0,I think it's harmful when feminism tries to come across as something it is not.
ThirdWaveFeminism,fr3mnn3,t1_fr3mepn,1589860819.0,Well I'm sorry for asking about what you think. If this is the definition all third wave feminists give then it seems it could be more harmful than thought.
ThirdWaveFeminism,fr3gcxa,t1_fr3g8p3,1589856830.0,I agree people should be treated fairly but that is not the dictionary definition of feminism. Feminism is advocacy for equal rights for females.
ThirdWaveFeminism,fr35g91,t1_fr34ptp,1589850327.0,i think no one is treated equally. but that is not feminism. feminism is women being equal to men. no all people being equal to one another.
ThirdWaveFeminism,fr33rz0,t1_fr33fyr,1589849356.0,everyone has the same basic human rights. i cannot tell if you or another enjoys them but by no means is it unfair.
ThirdWaveFeminism,fr2zpw1,t1_fr2zdoa,1589847045.0,do not imply what i am saying. people as a whole do not have equal rights but it is not females being unequal to men. frankly i am no idiot.
Sociopaths,fr2tqn7,t1_fr16boh,1589843719.0,i understand how she feels very well. i dont feel guilt for anything. i dont care that i cannot emphasize because i can show i care alot better than most people. like actually listenning to her.
ThirdWaveFeminism,fr2tlzr,t1_fr2qua3,1589843648.0,you see thats what you get wrong. i think people should have equal rights. not women being equal to men. that implies that women and treated unfairly which they are not. i think people as a whole should have a better life rather than females. that is my problem with feminism.
sex,fr0tn5p,t1_fr0qk6f,1589806447.0,no. im saying its just not very good for someone young. if its money sure but for no reason there is alot better people.
sex,fr0q48k,t3_gm06lp,1589803807.0,"sex is sex but i dont think it is well shared between someone of this age. obviously you are talking about if you werent 15. but consider, a 75 year old man having sex with you when you are 20. that man cannot provide proper love for you. that is why it is imoral. if it is 20-30 it is iffy age difference because still they are old and hardly can provide for you. sex is sex but love is alot different."
Sociopaths,fr0pu59,t3_glx15h,1589803579.0,i am careful to treat my girlfriend well. because i do love her.

Fallout,fqtaj8d,t1_fqt41r6,1589634663.0,the us and aus are allies in the fallout universe. we know vault tec loves money so why not push into aus
Fallout,fqs448o,t1_fqs3wh7,1589598084.0,So it doesn't mean there's not an Australian branch of vault tec lol. In lore Australia was a big helper of the us so it makes sense to have some American stuff in Aus.

Fallout,fqriu4u,t1_fqri373,1589585224.0,I don't see people going wow 50s America. I think people like seeing all the different areas as a time capsule. Rather than just America.
Fallout,fqrhy3d,t1_fqrhius,1589584711.0,"And you don't think there would be 50s Australian culture? Or there wouldn't be new Australian factions? For all you know there would be things even worse in Australia. I don't think you understood the concept. It's meant to be a fallout game, but with new aspects of gameplay with new people to meet."

Fallout,fqpgo66,t1_fqpg81o,1589545930.0,those are some great ideas! i think if it was done we would want various maps of certain areas in the form of dlc but the base game should be on a new engine and take time. not be rushed. i hate the way bethesda acts rn. it could be redemption for them to make something massive and un buggy lol

StarWars,fqnrrfb,t1_fqnn3ut,1589500181.0,consider how much energy is in the star wars universe though? in legends it was told that light sabers could only be used by force users. that it was partly powered by them. who knows mate.

sex,fq01ve8,t3_ggegbp,1589026752.0,"just use the fucking condom. it doesnt ruin the sex, the female feels good because of the how the penis feels in her vagina, having a condom on doesnt change it. i know you would be ok using a plan b pill but is the girl okay with it. ask her first. you are the one putting your body into hers. respect that."
AskASociopath,fq015s9,t3_gg8y7w,1589026524.0,from my observations (im male) most male sociopaths acts like 12 year olds on crack especially with their jokes when they are bored. whereas females tend to be well females. i think female sociopaths generally are bored less.

askphilosophy,fpjqkrb,t3_gdvxyl,1588678023.0,if someone is a functioning member of society (they can take care of themselves etc) then you regard them as a person. to judge a sociopath or psychopath you need not them to have empathy because the cause and affect is there. do you understand? if someone is not mentally stable things are taken into consideration. if they are then it doesnt matter. aspd or not.

AskMen,fn86wy7,t3_g07a9i,1586735198.0,In a good way? I'm assuming your looking for something solid. (Relationship wise) try to have a conversation and joke around with him. It's a guy not the president. If it is the president same applies. Some males find it negative if the woman is just there. Not talking. Or just being loud and obnoxious. Just treat the person like they are your friend. With a slight playful side.
pcmasterrace,fn86kjl,t1_fn85xks,1586734987.0,"Ok so. CPU is the brain, the amount of cores and threads it has is how many hands it has. The clock speed is how fast these hands can work. The ram is what is used to hold immediately need information. Eg textures. The GPU is basically a whole other PC dedicated to graphics. The more ram you have on the graphics card the higher the textures can load. The faster the clock speed the smoother it will be. The power supply is pretty self explanatory. Hard drives are to store ping term information like games. An SSD is a faster hard drive due to being solid rather than a spinning disc which is what a hard drive  uses. Any questions or finer details?"
