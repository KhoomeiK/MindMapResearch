You're right that everyone is different, but the constant variable is antidepressants; which change your own natural brain chemistry. There have been no conclusive studies stating antidepressants help in the long-run; short-term yes (even if it's biased), long-term no. Don't start telling me 12 months is long-term since the majority of people stay on longer than that time frame.

Am I saying my life is flawless and depression-free right now? No, not at all.

But taking a pill to put an artificial filter that makes your life less depressing? It's a joke. A multi-billion dollar industry facade which makes it so every user has to have a consistent monthly supply, and 3 days after you miss your last dosage, your life will start falling apart worse than how you felt originally. 

And how this is possibly hurting the human race in the long-term, teaching us not to adapt and persevere over hard life-changing experiences.

Please, I actually suggest you research the antidepressant industry more in-depth instead of casually recommending it to people who are going through tough times.

depression,fnc0105,t1_fnbxdi5,1586825769.0,"Because anti-depressants are a toss up between them working or not.

The worst isn't that it's a guessing game, but the fact that your body gets depended on them when you try to quit and go through terrible withdrawals. I mean mentally crippling withdrawals if you're on them for long enough.

And the fact that it eventually stops working when you're on them for long periods, hence why so many users end up on multiple or switch, causing the withdrawals to surface.

Honestly, beating depression by depending on manufactured pills by the pharmaceutical companies isn't the right long-term answer, or even a short one. Try beating your depression with tangible answers (eg: walks in nature, eat more nutritious foods, exercise), these habits will stick with you forever without a $ tag associated with it.

And if you doubt my experience, I was on Escitalopram (Lexapro/Cipralex) for 9 years and decided to quit 3 years ago. It's been a journey."
