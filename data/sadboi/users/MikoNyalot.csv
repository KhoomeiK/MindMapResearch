She won’t forgive me. She said me being introverted and doesn’t want to talk to her make her walked on eggshell and she is tired of it.

Most of the time, I just want to be left alone and not having small talk or go to the gym together. I just want to do it by myself. 

She said she can’t understand why was I so stubborn and always refused to take responsibility when I was told I am wrong. I just argued. All I want is not to be told that I am wrong. Because most of the time it’s really just misunderstanding and not doing exactly what they want me to. Like not putting the dishes in the correct order. Don’t place unused items on counter. Or don’t move the heavy stuff by myself. Don’t take away her task when she ask for help. I am not perfect and I do have my share of bad habit. When I argue that, they called me stubborn. They said I should accept to be called wrong and change my way without explaining it.

It’s hard and I am wrong. I always felt that it’s all my fault. Being called wrong just make it felt so much worse. I felt stupid, misunderstood and no one wants to hear me. They just want a nod and move on. Reason aren’t important. No one care."

I told them, I am introverted and speaking stressed me out. I am pretty indifferent to most people. I don’t make friend or open up easy. I don’t like small talk and be buddy buddy with people I just know. I don’t care about how they feel about me. I won’t be mean to them. I just don’t care much if they like me or not. I still nice and considerate. Help when needed. 

I don’t like to be told I am wrong. I’ll argued to the end of the world when I was told I am wrong. Because when I was told I am wrong I felt stupid and belittle and as if I am the mean person that purposely making everyone not happy.

What I felt is unjustified. It’s all fake. It’s all due to my imagination. It’s all because how my brain interpret it to fit my narrative of how useless I am. Self fulfilling destruction. 

Each and every action I took when I am on emotional break down were just pushing myself away, abandoning people. Self preservation is fake because there are no dangers. It’s all my emotions playing at me, like phobia, running away when felt hurt is irrational. My fight, flight, freeze response is unjustified. I shouldn’t have fight, I shouldn’t have flight, I shouldn’t have freeze. There are no danger. Just my brain playing trick on me. 

If I fight, flight or freeze, I am just hurting people around me. I make them felt like they are dangerous, hurting them, abandoning them. 

They said, my feeling is important, but when I shows a little frustration, talking about things that frustrates me, it’s petty. And I agree. I am petty, childish and selfish. It’s all my fault. 

So no, I don’t talk about why I want to end myself. I can’t. If I do, I’ll just be bearing myself out there and be told how selfish I am. How I am planing of abandoning them.

I know him. If I walk away now, then that’s it. He won’t even consider it anymore. He would say I abandoned him. He would say I choose to walk away and that’s on me. He would still believe that I lied and not telling him the truth. 

I love him, he is in the bad place right now. But I can’t get pass myself. I can’t just stop hurting. I can’t just stop being depressed and I don’t have the answer that satisfy him. I told him the truth and he isn’t satisfied."
polyamory,fhc67rv,t1_fhc41fb,1581457024.0,"I don’t have issue with them having sex. But when I am crying and depressed hearing them having sex is excruciating. 

When I am not feeling well and get shouted, and woke up with the noise, it hurts. 

Fuck sexual needs. I just want a little more concern. He hurts his back few months back. I can’t ask him to have sex with me when he already trying hard to fulfil her needs."
polyamory,fhc4to2,t3_f2ee5n,1581456226.0,"I have been with him for 3 years. It’s been a Long distance relationship. We manage to maintained it well by talking everyday and meet one once every few months. This year, I took a 3 months sabbatical from work and decide to spend around 10 weeks at his place. He met his new partner around 6 months ago and have been living with him. I feel like a guest. I am mono and don’t have interest in girls. He wants more than one partner and I am ok with it. 

We had an argument the day before and basically I was a crying mess and fall asleep on the couch. I woke up hearing them laughing and having sex. 

When they ready to go out to a friend event, I Guess they decide that I wasn’t going. They did not tell me to get ready Nor asked if I want to go. They got ready and pretty and ready to go just like that, while I sit on the couch feel terrible about myself. 

He kept asking me what’s wrong and I said I was really upset that he got angry at me because I had a dizzy spell. That I wasn’t being helpful. That he shouted at me when I tried to help. I am upset at being useless. He doesn’t believe me. He kept asking me what’s wrong, keep saying I lie to him. 

I did not say I am upset about them having sex, because it would come out all wrong. I am upset because they have more fun without me. They have sex and ready for a night out while I am crying and depressed. 

I am upset because I thought I meant more than just someone that would do chores. That he would be more concern when I told him a have a dizzy spell and not able to stand up. But all I get is “you should have fed us before 2pm”. I offered them to make food before that, one said not hungry and he just shrug. I felt bad for eating after that. So it’s my own doing that I am a mess and not being useful. I got dizzy and not able to do anything and get shouted for boing being helpful. It’s all because I did not make food before 2 pm. Because I fail to be in my best condition to help. 

And apparently I am punishing the dog since I kept the dog in the bed room while she is in the shower. I was dizzy and won’t be able to handle a 70lbs dog. I kept it in the room so the dog won’t pee/pop on the carpet. Where I need to clean it afterward. 

But all I do is to make the dog depressed. 
By keeping the dog in the room while she took shower. 

I am so useless and a dog punisher. 

He hasn’t been talking to me because I haven’t told him the truth. He doesn’t believe that I am upset because he shouted. He apologies for shouting and that’s it. I am the one that kept thing from him. I am at fault. I can’t stand the noise and laughter they make. I have no where to go"
polyamory,fhc25gx,t1_fhc1u2e,1581454685.0,Thank you. You are so kind. I don’t know how to talk. I told him the reason I was hurt and he doesn’t believe me. He said I lied. He said there must be something else. I don’t know what to do. I have nothing else to say.

The moment you commented on a post, a snide remarks, a simple gesture towards a person, you contributed to their demised. You have an opinion and you care enough to voice it. 

If you really don’t care, then don’t do anything. Just walk away. Ignore it. 

Blaming your life on an unrelated person just means show that you are vindictive without reason. Please do it to those that directly contribute to your struggles. 

If I am contributing to it, you could blame me, that’s more reasonable. Not unknown, unrelated person."
Vent,f69b7op,t1_f698mks,1572739635.0,"Don’t be the trigger. It’s not your job, not your responsibility and not something to be proud off. 

I am sorry that you are feeling the turmoil. 

I do envy those that succeeded in taking their own life. I envy those that die in accident and frequently ask why not me. But I’ll never wish death upon anyone. Someone told me to live is to struggle. To live is to be tortured. I want to end it. 

But wishing death upon someone because it bring peace to the person means that adding tortured to those that still alive. 

Moreover, it might be dead ends for some but more often than not, there is a future for those that manage to get through the struggle. Your encouragement add to that struggle. Reduce their struggle if you can just don’t add it. They might still have future.

I am in pain and I want to die. Yet, I know my death would bring pain to those that still alive no matter how minuscule. It would be unneeded burden to them.

I really wish there is a way to erase one existence."

I am suicidal. I want to end it. I am grasping every single strand of hope. The strand getting thinner and the straw getting heavier. 

Don’t be that last straw that broke a person. If you can’t be sympathetic, walk away. If reading about suicidal vent irks you, block it. 

If you can’t be kind, then be indifferent. Let those struggle continue to struggle. Don’t add into their struggle for that few seconds of feeling superior."

He asked me what do I want him to do?

I don’t know. I have no solution. I can’t tell him what I want. 

Of course I’d want all this doesn’t happens, that he would thought of my feeling before gave it to me. 
But these won’t work, what’s done was done. 
He won’t be able to know and would not be able to even comprehend why would such a small issue affect me so much. He could accept it, but there is no way he could prevent it or agree with it."

BDSMAdvice,ey3qj5q,t1_ey3q6se,1566771082.0,"He had gave me more collars since then. It wasn’t the same though. I don’t have that much attachment to the other collars as much as the first one. 

The reasons he bought me more collar is because I did not downplay it. But he thought I made a mountain out of molehill. It’s an insignificant issue for him. It’s his possession and he could use it however he liked."
BDSMAdvice,ey3ppzp,t1_ey3p2nq,1566770476.0,"Yes and yes. Since it was picked by his ex, it would always be on my mind that this wasn’t meant for me. It would remind me of his ex. 

I think, since it was special to me, I do want it to be something he picked for me. Not a left over by someone else. 

I lack of confidence. I am unsure. I always think he could do better. Yet, I know I could be really good sub if he treats me right. 

I wish my brain isn’t that stubborn sometimes, why bother by the smallest issue? Why can’t I let it go, this ugly feeling."

polyamory,exc5odp,t1_exc4fce,1566144020.0,"He argued that it was the dressed that makes me looks pregnant. He was embarrassed at that moment and it’s more about my self destructive behaviour. And my question is basically a trap question. 

When I asked again few days later he still said yes for that moment but not anymore since I have changed the dress out. That still hurt. 

I can’t seems to get over this looped and my mood has been in rabbit hole since then. This frustrates him, and I don’t have a solution, I don’t know what to tell him or what can he do to make me feel better. I really don’t.

And the issue with the gf.. it frustrates me. He can’t be here with me, he can’t spend time with me, he can’t make himself focus on me. It makes me resent her and makes me think that she do it on purpose. She knew he promise to call me once they get home. Yet acted out so he has to attend to her. Maybe it’s all just in my mind.

Sorry I need to rant and let out."

It’s organised in first drawer as what I called ouchie drawer; knives, needles, scalpels, alcohol swipes, gloves etc. 

Second drawer is the bondage drawer; cuffs, collars, gags, anything leather and binding. 

Last are the dildoes, all sort of sizes and purposed, from rubber to metal to glass... 

Last, below the last drawers were heavy chain, large ropes, pad locks, etc.
