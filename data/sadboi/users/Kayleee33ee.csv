On that note your children aren't as terrible as you seem to think. A major part of their Father's life has been kept from them, their Father the man who is supposed to make them feel comfortable telling him a thing failed to do so himself. That being said you still aren't assholes because telling them or not is your choice.

Yes, some of the things your children did are crossing the line, but they are coping just as you had to. You need to teach them how to healthy cope, and understand they 100% have grounds to be mad."
