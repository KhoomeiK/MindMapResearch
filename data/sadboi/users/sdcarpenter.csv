""Less than Yesterday"" can be applied to anything (exercise, studying). The thing you tell yourself before you begin is that all you have to do is ""less than yesterday."" The idea is to avoid some arbitrary marker that overwhelms you & prevents you from starting. Feel free to do ""more than yesterday,"" but congratulate yourself for doing ""less."" I personally use this to encourage myself to meditate - one of the most beneficial things I can do, but the most likely to put off. 

""Just one tooth"". This method is to encourage flossing. Tell yourself ""just one tooth."" Then once you do the ""one tooth"" ask yourself if you want to do another...the answer is almost always ""yes."" So just keep going, one tooth at a time.

AskScienceDiscussion,flns40x,t1_flmkon1,1585324812.0,"I don't disagree about being efficient reading the most relevant sections. However:

1. Personally, I feel that I'm able to do that now - read certain sections & grasp the content, because I spent ~2-3 years reading fundemental papers in a controlled setting (Avg 2 papers per month in group & 1-2 on my own per month). 

2. Skipping sections - even though necessary - can backfire! I've had extensive issues at work because PI's/Professors ""read"" a paper, made assumptions about methods - without reading it. They would then instruct me to apply these new techniques incorrectly. I picked up on these issues ONLY because I had read the majority of the paper in question. 

3. For OP though, I would definitely follow ConantheProletarian's advice & focus on the Introduction! But I'd really dig into it. A good project might be to find & read the original sources cited in the introduction. Depending on the paper(s), that could really lay a solid foundation of the literature in that particular discipline. 

4. It wouldn't be a bad idea to start keeping track now. Either with a citation manager or even a text file with the Article Title, Author, Journal, Year & DOIs. Notes won't hurt your future self either;)"
AskScienceDiscussion,flmg049,t3_fporqj,1585282595.0,"Applaud the effort! This is inspiring to hear. A few points:

1. Don't feel pressured to read only journal articles. There is a plethora of accessibly written science books for the average reader. These might give you a broader understanding of the concepts that will help you better understand more specific information down the road. 

 2. To better understand journal articles. Used textbooks that are a version or two old might be a good resource. Use the glossary & index to look up jargon - the examples in textbooks have typically been given lots of thought & consideration. It's also nice to have only a few locations where you can go to review the knowledge - instead of the internet where it can be hard to find ""that one website that explained it so well."" 

3. Don't be so hard on yourself. I've worked in neuroscience research for ~10 years. When we read these journal articles, it'd often take hours to read & prepare for a particular article. We would then meet as a group and it'd take several hour long meetings/discussions to get through an average journal article. It's not easy, even for the experts;)

I totally feel you! When I first moved across country after university, I had the most difficult time saving any significant amouot of money. Not only was I not making much ~25k, but I wasn't very effective at saving. I'd keep ~500-1k in my account but it seemed like every ~6mo something would happen & wipe me out. This occurred over a period of years. Everything from getting hit by a car while biking (twice), to car expenses, to medical tests, to helping out when my fiancè's car was reposessed. 

It wasn't until I had learned both effective savings techniques & effective goal setting techniques that I was able to acrue a significant amount of money. The savings techniques came from financial literacy classes that I was required to take as part of a tuition savings program. The most important take home from that was that proper budgeting doesnt entirely forbid 'pleasure' items (fancy coffee, dinners out, fun acivities). Instead the best method is to factor them in - to point you're able - as regular 'rewards' for your progress.  Another equally good lesson is automate your savings & limit your the ease of access to your savings account (e.g. seperate accounts or even banks). You could look into such classes either online or in your area. However the most progress I made was when I learned an effective goal setting approach. 

This brings me to [Push Goals](https://theartofcharm.com/podcast-episodes/chalene-johnson-push-real-way-set-achieve-goals-episode-378/). I highly recommend listening to the full episode on the link, but there is a summary as well. The breakdown is you set smaller [SMART ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria?wprov=sfti1) goals in each of 10 areas (e.g. Pure joy, learning, fitness, romantic, life purpose/profession, financial, menal wellness, etc). Then you set your bigger more audacious goal. The idea of this goal is that it ties the goals from the other 10 areas all together into a more cohesive overarching 'objective.' There are additional steps like brain dumping & how to set reminders & follow through on action items. 

The drastic difference this process created in me was nothing short of phenomenal! All of a sudden when it came to spending money; I now had several personal & meaningful reasons to stick to my plans. Previously, I just had some lofty idea of acheiving 'something better' at 'somepoint' in the future. This wasn't that helpful in preventing uplanned 'nights out' or purchasing items that all of sudden felt 'necessary.' The change was more than I anticipated. 

By this point, I was making ~35k. But I still had minimal savings and was 5k down in student debt. In a little under a year I had paid off the student debt, had ~10k in persoal savings, an additional 1k in student savings program and was accepted to graduate school. I was able to quit work & focus on graduate school full time. I also got married around this time. Wedding was less than 1k (most of that was fees) as we kept the cermony & family dinner small.  We also prepared our own food for 'reception' but also asked people to bring sides & drinks, making it more of a potluck style gathering. 

This brings me to the rub. This wasnt enough to prevent additional 'life' events from happening. I had to take time off from school for medical reasons. I ended up not finishing the program in order to move across country for my wife's new job. We are now separated & in the process of getting a divorce. 

I am in a similar position to previously: I have minimal savings, currently no income and 10k in student debt (from the aborted M.S. program). I will likely have to start graduate school from the beginning (if I decide to go back). So I am basically having to start this process all over again. 

I am struggling with motivation to 'start over' but trying to realize that it's all part of the process. I am reframing all of these 'life events' as 'life lessons.' Life events don't ever 'stop' and I am having to realize that one never 'arrives' at place of immunity. I am taking what I can from each one, trying to remember to express sincere graditude for everything I've experienced along the way. 

Apologies for the rant, but obviously I dealing with a lot & it helped to write it out. I hope that somebody is able to garner a shred of helpfull knowledge from my ramblings. Best to all of you who in your own journey!

Tl/dr:
- Gratitude is key!
- Financial literacy classes
- [Push Goals](https://theartofcharm.com/podcast-episodes/chalene-johnson-push-real-way-set-achieve-goals-episode-378/) are incredibly helpful.
- Repeat the push goal process every few months
- Realizing that 'life events' will continue to happen: I can choose to see these events as  'gettting in the way' or I can accept this fact & learn what I can from them. 
- Best to all on their journey!
