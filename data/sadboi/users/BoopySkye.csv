It’s just one year. I’m sure if he’s asked you to do this, there’s more things too. See the signs, evaluate them and talk to your close friends.

When I went back home I did go to a better doctor because I was still throwing up out of no where every other day and this was a month later almost.

Seeing as cats can be impregnated by multiple tomcats in the same pregnancy, I naturally wondered if those kittens would be born apart from each other or perhaps if that might account for why some appear smaller than others.

The other two are tiny competitively and still find it hard to walk. Would this have something to do with the time of conception itself or their overall health perhaps?"

When she expresses her insecurity or jealousy to him, he probably manipulates her or gaslights her into thinking she’s being irrational or it’s someone else’s fault. So she does the next best thing which is deflect her anger from his shady behaviors at you. One can hope she realizes she probably deserves better and dumps his ass but in my experience, most girls like that always seem to pick the guys that provoke jealousy and insecurity. So yeah, leave her to her miserable relationship and just keep hanging your bras as you do. Her crappy relationship isn’t your problem. This is your home.

You may start neglecting your own personal responsibilities, but there’s no excuse if you are neglecting a young child or infant under your care.

Talk to her openly about your concerns. This will be a great way to show her that your reticence is not unreasonable and just comes from a place of care. It is the sign of a responsible mother to not be okay with it. 22 is not all that old. People make super dumb decisions. Half of my friends at that age were dating terrible and abusive boyfriends.

But contrary to what others on this post say, it’s not very uncommon or suspicious to lose memory right after surgery. There are several factors that can influence the functioning of your brain’s memory center after a stressful event like surgery. If surgery or the event that led to surgery was traumatic, people may suppress memories in the form of dissociation. If it is amnesia, people might regain certain types of memories, like semantic memories or specific episodic memories, they might regain episodic memories from a very specific period only. And unfortunately sometimes with amnesia people may not recover any lost memory at all. (Source: I’m a clinical psychologist with a background in neuroscience)

I hope it does work out for her. It’s probably very hard with you being in different countries.

But of course, don’t pressure her or get impatient. It might work but even so it would be at her own pace. If she feels tired or frustrated or upset, just stop, it’s not gonna help her remembering anything if she’s not in a clearheaded state.

Edit: I do not think there’s any issue with a girl and a guy being bffs. Or her wearing short shorts or a robe around. There’s one of two things happening here.

The truth really is that there are so many factors that determine the effectiveness of therapy. It’s not like going to a medical doctor where they can simply hear your symptoms out and let the meds do the work. Finding the right therapist can be a trial and error process sometimes. It’s like finding a friend almost. The most important factor in how effective therapy is perhaps is the relationship you and your therapist are able to build together. And the experience and knowledge of the therapist is so important in determining that. You might want to try more confrontational therapies, like REBT. I don’t know what sort of therapy you went to but I’m assuming it would be traditional CBT?

Medications and therapy are at their most effective when used together for severe psychological disturbances. Not all patients will experience weight gain, and if you do, you can find alternatives that help you avoid it. Moreover, I don’t need to be a therapist to tell you that wanting to die more than gaining some weight is not the thinking process of an emotionally healthy brain. You may agree too.

All medications have side effects, but if your life is under threat and the medications are life saving, then the side effects are the least of your concerns. 

I am a psychologist and always a proponent of psychotherapy. It’s a very good mindset to be skeptical of the side effects and over prescription of medication, but you would not fall in that category of patients. Not by a mile. You are who those medications are developed for. They can save your life. If you’re at the point of killing yourself, why not give them a shot. What do you have to lose. Can’t get worse, they could only potentially make things better. And it’s very important to start regular and intensive psychotherapy alongside it. That will allow you to treat the mind and the body and be able to ween off the drugs over time and rely on the therapeutic skills you gained. 

Please do give it a shot. For whatever last straws that are keeping you hanging, just give them a shot. I have nothing to gain from encouraging this to you except my research-based knowledge of the fact that the chances are you will feel better and you’ll gladly welcome any side effects if it means you feel better."

I have a feeling she’ll say BDI but whatever she says really, unless she was there when it happened or right after before the police showed up, her claims are based on speculation. Her writing this book after years is probably not a desperate attempt to rid herself from the guilt of holding it in for decades but probably cause she figured hey this case is getting a lot of attention once again in this past decade or so and I should get a book deal. Hey, id probably do the same if I was her. I’m sure a lot of what she says will give insight to the household but should be read keeping in mind of the fact that it’s just her words and interpretations, it’s not evidence and it can’t really be proven in any way if what she says about her interactions with the Ramseys is true or not."

And I’m sorry to say but if you’re boyfriend is that oblivious to it, and these will be your future in-laws, I think that’s reason enough to consider that this isn’t a lasting relationship for you. I assume you haven’t been together for all that long considering you’re just finding out all of this about his parents now, so I strongly think you can consider ending this relationship based on this. I can also see that his parents are not just being their normal racist selves but purposely trying to get under your skin. And considering the things they say around your boyfriend about you, your hair or skin or anything else, wow he’s either thick af or will eventually start to reveal his own biases and implicit prejudices."
UnresolvedMysteries,fpc7ldh,t3_gcex8a,1588490320.0,"So my questions are that did the police identify him simply on the basis of the missing lodge guest reported? Or was some sort of identification found? Did the lodge call for rescue after he never showed up and a helicopter was sent? If so, did the helicopter fly over the area where the sign was later found? I’m curious about if he made the sign later and how soon after he went missing did a rescue helicopter come around if even was a rescue. 

To me it seems possible that he kept wandering around trying to find his way back when he heard a helicopter near by the cliff, ran over there, missing the copter and then continued finding a way back at which point he may have gotten injured, or maybe he was already injured and simply got exhausted and set up a sign. 

The lodge would probably hold much more info about when they called off the search for him etc."

relationships,fopvica,t3_g8ki6c,1587973518.0,"I would advise you to hold out on that a bit longer and pursue therapy, both individual therapy and then once that seems to help you a bit then couples therapy. It’s probably much more likely that your depression has led to the lack of intimacy and the perception of your relationship as negative. It’s just what depression does. And it makes us blame everything other than itself for the causes of our misery. 

Please seek help for yourself. And once you feel like your perceptions are not influenced by your emotions, after talking it through with a therapist as well, you can make that decision. But making such a decision in a depressed mindset might fill you with regret or even more loneliness and misery. You might realize that nothing changed for you, even if she’s not there anymore. So deal with this confounding factor, talk to the therapist, allow yourself to unseal that emotional block and then be able to talk to your wife. Seems like you just described a major problem in your relationship yourself in your post, ie, your inability to be open and communicate easily about intimate or person things."

Yes, he was a severely emotionally and psychologically disturbed kid and this was not the first time he had attempted suicide. Could she have stopped him? Sure, possibly. Does that make it her fault he died? No, and even if she had stopped him, statistically it’s very likely he would have attempted again and perhaps been successful.

JonBenetRamsey,foj0fdg,t1_fohwfsr,1587803482.0,"It could be corporal punishment but it what seems very obvious is poor communication patterns and emotional and verbal abuse growing up. His “social awkwardness” is so typical in children who grew up in environments where expressing their emotions or impulses in a healthy way was punished or ridiculed or resulted in any negative consequence. I also think in comparison to JB, who was sort of the star of the family, Burke was probably neglected and unfairly reminded of his inferiority to his sister repeatedly. Throwing poop at that age is very common among children who experienced chronic emotional and attentional neglect. Heck, kids do that stuff even in good homes. When my boyfriends baby brother was born, he was 4 at the time and his parents wanted to have a talk with him to explain what’s happening and that even though he may not be getting attention as much as the baby it doesn’t mean he’s not important loved blah blah and my boyfriend said can we throw him off the balcony? It’s something we laugh at now, just a little kid expressing his jealousy in bizarre ways but after a murder, in retrospect it’s easy to interpret all these things as “signs”. Really if anything they only indicate chronic neglect and abuse.

I’m not saying Burke did not do it no way, I’m just saying that many people base their opinion on his childhood behavior and they need to be better informed of what that might actually indicate."

On the other hand I grew up in a house where my mom was the cook, cleaner, caregiver and worked a job in between. My dad was had a very high up position, sure his job was stressful but most days he would leave around mid afternoon and go play golf with his buddies then come home and lay on the couch and just talk about how tired and stressed he is without any consideration for my mom who did much more physically taxing work. Not once would he ask her if she needed something or help around the house. He’d often go on vacations with buddies when he felt like it and she never got one cause who would take care of the kids.

Most children will develop better emotional regulation but the trauma will manifest itself different, such as in inappropriate affect or emotional blunting.

The worst part is just that your wife doesn’t seem to understand why she is wrong. I would suggest you talk to your wife carefully about how she has certain underlying issues regarding her weight that she apparently never dealt with and is now making them her daughters issues. She needs professional help. 

As a kid who’s mother made apparent my physical flaws plenty, let her know this would never help her child, instead she should be setting her child up to be confident and laugh in the face of bullies and know that her real value comes from a lot more than her appearance."
