Sometimes for me it's more of a sense of belonging, I've moved around a lot and travelled around the world, now I believe, all in the hopes of finding home. It's nice to know I'm not the only one who feels this way"

unpopularopinion,fqjek0u,t3_giz83s,1589408832.0,I bloody love oatmeal raisin cookies and would be more upset if if got the chocolate chip one haha
unpopularopinion,fqje2zn,t3_gj88p5,1589408642.0,"Surely with your forensic argument they would just ask for the clothes the person was wearing, not ask what they were wearing as it's irrelevant in your context. Actually, in the case of sexual assault and/or rape I would it's irrelevant in any context."
unpopularopinion,fqjbavb,t3_giqzyz,1589407556.0,"I hate cooking. I don't enjoy it and it's not fun. I don't think that I'm being 'cute' by not cooking, I don't want to. I can manage perfectly fine without cracking out a bunch of recipes though. I mean what are you calling cooking? Because I call getting a kiev and veg out the freezer and putting it in the oven (not the veg) cooking haha I live with a chef and honestly, I'd rather not deal with the hassle or criticism every time I walk into the kitchen, so I don't. Will I starve if I live alone? No. But cooking doesn't make you some kind of magical adult also"
unpopularopinion,fqj9jxf,t1_fqgxkd8,1589406891.0,"I am sorry that someone you had trusted as a friend said such horrific things to you, I can't imagine the betrayal you felt all over again. People out there support you and know the truth. Your opinion is not unpopular with me and my friends so know that there are those of us fighting to ensure rapists never see the light of day. Thank you for sharing your story."
unpopularopinion,fqj7xc5,t1_fqiis2c,1589406262.0,"Yes. Agree. You know what got me? That scene in the last Avengers movie where they get all the women together for a fight. Why can't they fight alongside men? Why do we have to separate? That is the opposite of equality and breeds further resentment. Women are capable, powerful, magnificent and effervescent - but we all are ;)"
unpopularopinion,fqj7934,t3_gitbcx,1589406004.0,"I agree. We shouldn't support based upon gender. However, I believe the sentiment behind the attitude is due to the past attitude of competitiveness between women. It's an attempt to undo centuries of women not supporting one another and being pitted against one another. We see it all the time. There's certainly the idea of a 'bro code' but not one for women. I believe it's to encourage comradery and support. I can't stand the idea of 'men suck, women rule' it's that kind of attitude that sets back feminism and also creates more discord between the two. Equality is about just that, that neither is superior to the other."

Sims4,fqi3kmf,t1_fqhofws,1589389397.0,It looks amazing so your hard work has certainly paid off! You should make a tutorial for 'flat simmers' like me haha
Sims4,fqi3eov,t1_fqhiui1,1589389286.0,"Yes!! It's always flat, and usually with some bushes and a few flowers - if they're lucky! Landscaping is not my forte, clearly I need to just sit and play with those tools next time I play"
thesims,fqh0dom,t3_giqgrv,1589363471.0,So many 'makeover' sims look like this now :/ also does a makeover have to be massive plastic surgery? Can't they just get a nice new hairdo and some lippy?! Dammit! üòÖüòÖ

AskReddit,fo1i953,t3_g4uku1,1587433868.0,"My parents divorced when I was very young and my mother remarried. I have two half-siblings who are 5 and 8 years younger than me. I moved away straight after high school - I had always wanted to travel/explore, always said I wanted to go places. Fast forward a couple of decades and I live abroad. My family have two WhatsApp family group chats. One with me in it, and the other without. It feels great. There are many other things that let me know I wasn't really included - official family portraits without me in them, matching family jewelry - small things, that build up and let you know your place."
Sims4,fj6byz6,t3_fbmzd8,1583066559.0,This happened to me too - with the exact same Sims in the welcome wagon... Weird!
