He was in bed with another woman before even telling his wife he was fine. This were weeks he dissapeared. Jo was worried sick. And he was just banging IZ.

Fuck that.

There is no way to say that was for the kids. Because he could have a relationship with the kids without banging their mother. WTF. Plus, his reasoning to getting back together sounded like those people that stay in a marrriage for the kids. And we all know how that ends. 

They literally compared having separated parents to Alex's parents (psycho mother that triied to kill her children and psycho druggie daddy). The audacity of the writers. There are a ton of escenarios where children grow happy when parents share custody or have custody arragenments. They made it seem like such an arragenment would be equal to how Alex was raised. WTF. That pisses me off so much."

greysanatomy,fkziokn,t1_fkw8ujw,1584671916.0,">Link had valid reasons for not declaring his undying loyalty for Amelia despite possibly not being the dad

I am not sure what reasons. Literally they were fuck buddies, he starts to catch feelings, she isn't sure, they agree to take it slow and BAM!! pregnant. A pregnancy obviously brought them together, but the way Amelia handled this whole paternity thing, was inexcusable. She should be the one groveling not Link. Just because she's the only one pregnant does not mean that she's the only one that matters.

In my opinion, the minute she started playing mind games with such a serious issue as the babies's paternity, all those so-called reasons went out of the window.

Amelia was extremely hypocritical since she did the same thing when she knew baby momma problems were on the horizon with Owen. She dropped Owen AND Leo so fast. IMO, nobody is so easily accepting of baby momma/daddy drama if they can avoid it. Especially, if it isn't clear whether your partner is over said babby momma/daddy.

So Link had a right to an informed decision just she had the right to not want to be in a relationship with him. But she was manipulative and an asshole and I was wishing that baby wasn't his so he could run away from her."

And they did get close during this pregnancy but they were still on shaky ground. Link has all the right to doubt her, since she never said she stopped loving Owen.

And btw, not everyone wants baby daddy drama, custody battles and a 3rd person inserted in the parenting. It is extremely messy and not everyone wants to be involved in that."
