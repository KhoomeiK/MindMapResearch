It can also convince somebody to subscribe too due to double points being earned for subscribers. I wouldn't say its a huge loss to have this reward as long as its set at an extremely high price. Also itll be fun to watch for viewers when it is redeemed.

Anxiety,fgc10xn,t1_fgbysas,1580668008.0,Try using it at a time when the shops wont have a lot of people in them like really early morning or half n hour from close time might help you out if theres less people around shopping. Ik this sounds silly but even make a list on your phone how to operate the machine if you do forget in the moment. Just try make small steps doesn't matter how slow you progress I wish you all the best
Anxiety,fgaw3mv,t3_exojnx,1580656028.0,"As soon as I met contact with another persons eyes I used to just dip my head down for a few seconds let them pass then lift my head back up, I don't do this anymore I just look ahead of them but i can be a little bit nervous when our eyes do connect but your only seeing that person for like 10 seconds then boom probably never again so doesn't bother me too much if our eyes do meet. I wish you all the best with this issue try to just look ahead and keep your head up <3"
Anxiety,fg7qvtu,t3_exdzz8,1580599198.0,Yea used to really avoid going to the shops due to interactions with the cashier i just didn't want to go through then self serve checkout was introduced and its been a blessing since its release.
