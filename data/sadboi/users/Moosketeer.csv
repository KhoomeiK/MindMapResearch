Also, is it cheeky to say happy cake day?"
vegan,fop4424,t1_fop29u2,1587952649.0,"Hm. You make a good point. Presently while typing this I have to come to the conclusion of rescinding my afore mentioned statement of respecting all conviction or saying that I do respect the conviction of the Nazi soldiers just as much.

You have truly made me think differently, and to that end I commend you.

Now, as to rework my previous statement, I give you this:

""I do.

I truly believe that when you believe something is the right thing to do not just for your own protection but for the protection of others, that much aught to be respected.

The Nazi soldiers were people just like us that were unfortunately born into the wrong place at the wrong time, allowing them to believe things as broken as they did. While I possess **total** disdain for the belief system they held to, I must acknowledge their misguided bravery/conviction.

Again, to reiterate, I by **no** means respect the disgusting and hateful things they believed, but I simply must respect their conviction because only one person can decide if they actually believe something.

I respect veganism in that way."""
vegan,fop1jzi,t1_fop129c,1587951044.0,"I do. 

Although I would halt to say there's a difference between conviction and conditioning. 

For instance, I respect the American Confederate soldiers' *conviction* in fighting for their state rights and defending their land. Despite the fact that the war was most definitely an argument of whether or not they could keep slavery enacted. Which to clarify is seriously messed up, and I don't support at all.

BUT I do not respect the Nazi german soldiers' *conditioning* into believing that their enemy was anyone of jewish decent, well, anyone who wasn't german and white. Because those people were just made into that through propaganda and deceit, they didn't have an actual moral realization."
vegan,fop0wlu,t1_fop0p19,1587950639.0,"Well, I don't think it *is* the better path. That's what's stopping me.

Personally my belief system doesn't lead me to believe that it is more morally correct to not eat meat. However I still respect it simply bc conviction itself is a powerful and noble thing. Even if I disagree with it."
vegan,fop0imo,t1_fop01u4,1587950398.0,Thank you for that insightful read. I truly appreciate it.
vegan,fop0bow,t1_foozwvk,1587950278.0,"No, I mean I genuinely respect it. Someone who so strongly believes that every single creature aught to be spared and protected is noble and I appreciate it.

vegan,fooz8mu,t1_fooz0cp,1587949616.0,"Fair enough.

vegan,fooyzyx,t1_fooyng4,1587949470.0,"Y'know, even if I'm not convinced, the abolitionist analogy is actually really good and not one I've ever thought of. I grant you, you have changed my perspective.

If you don't mind a follow up question; What *is* it in the first place? Obviously I know ""Don't eat meat or dairy or whatever"" but I honestly don't know much about what the actual reason and belief system is."

What it means is bad, though they are the same word, contextually the meanings take a massive shift. For instance, one of my closest friends is gay. When we’re joking he’ll call me a faggot and I him. We don’t literally mean “you are gay and that’s bad” we mean “this is a word that in the context is an insult”.

Dude, maybe start with a tone and stick with it cause that was more outta nowhere than a head on collision with a 16 wheeler and just as much as a wreck.

Not to be so hard on it. My point is that if you're gonna do something with lines that violent and offensive, then you have to START with them as to set the tone, not just pull them outta nowhere. It's like on FML by that dude who did the new ""ROXANNE"" song. Outta nowhere he's just straight up racist and says ""Got latina in you so I know you kinda crazy.""

If you're gonna start saying something highly offensive that's fine but don't make it come outta nowhere. We should know that that's your style. One more thing, ""Flow so nice, put me on water and I'll sail well"" ?? That's just awkward. You sound like a 15 yo grime rapper from blackpool.
