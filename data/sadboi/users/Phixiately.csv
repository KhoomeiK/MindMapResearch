I have been thinking the same thing over and over, I have been thinking ways to hide things, every day, this is the safest, less painful choice so far, it costs a lot of pain, but even then it is batter than anything else.

I do not know what else to say, what can I say how can you enjoy it how how how... well the anime follows the best path you could get on the visual novel and arrives to the best ending, on the novel you can fuck up some things, and on one of those paths, save her, but trust me, if you do, they will make you feel a bittersweet sensation all until the end, they will make you feel guilty.

Steins Gate 0 is crap, nothing happens on there, nothing, but, if you want to go for the whole enchilada, I would say try Steins Gate until episode 22, then the episode of the dvd box, the alternative episode 23 (Kyōkaimenjō no Misshingu Rinku) and then the whole Steins Gate 0, then go back to the original episode 23 of Steins Gate 23, the episode 24 and the episode 25 OVA, I heard the movie is not canon so I haven't checked it out, I mean, I enjoyed the show, natually, I love time travel and the whole series get very heartbreaking at times (I cried, for god's sake, how ridiculous of me) but watching it in retrospective, the characters were totally rigid, insipid, and Steins Gate 0 was below average and totally unnecessary.
