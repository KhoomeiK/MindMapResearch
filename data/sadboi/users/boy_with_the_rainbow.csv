Im a white kid from sweden so I can bet you it is not the most popular genre here so when someone saw what I listened to they said something like ""why are you listening to so gay music"".. or something like that Im not really sure. But it made me change music taste completely. Now when Im 18 there is alot of people my age talking about how great the music was back then."
