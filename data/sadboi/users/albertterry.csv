Being a power-hungry asshole is not going to help you get more people to your sub or keep your moderator position. You may think you're such a big guy, muting someone because they gave you an argument that you can't counter, but in actuality, it makes you fragile, unable to take simple words. And when it happens in real life, you can't ban or mute them. You have to sit there and take it. If how you treated OP is how you react to a well-structured argument, you won't last 5 seconds in the real world. So I highly recommend you

1. Get a backbone and

2. Don't abuse your moderator powers."

I would have expected the entire fandom to tear into him (and a lot of you did), and I'd watch laughing my butt off.

I've never seen the video because I didn't want to get triggered, but I'm guessing he focused on Squeak Squad. And while he did commit genocide over cake, he wasn't the only one who had an OOC moment. Meta Knight would've gladly sat Kirby down and told him that the shortcake wasn't in the chest Kirby's been chasing the whole game, but instead the ruler of the underworld was in the chest."
