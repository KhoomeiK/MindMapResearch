Anytime an attractive private would arrive in our unit, all of the NCOs (sergeants, staff sergeants etc) would fucking orbit and sometimes end up sleeping with them, I’ve seen soldiers divorce their spouse to get with one.

I was abused pretty heavily growing up and really didn’t have any self-esteem/confidence, it took military service to learn how to assert myself or not be totally terrified by the idea of rejection. I was not comfortable at all because I didn’t have protection, I hardly knew her, and she wanted to do it in the fucking woods. I denied denied denied for probably an hour, but she was saying things like “if you like me and want to be my boyfriend you’ll do it” etc. I got a STI, she slept with somebody else before I even had the chance to see her again, and she told her friends I raped and beat her. It didn’t seem possible to talk about it and not be laughed at it. I told my mom and she told me it wasn’t possible for a woman to assault a man."

I really wasn’t keen on photographer myself, but I had an idea that she might want that. I think that’s something I might have to tactfully run by her before I commit to it. It was largely for the opportunity to have a scene set up. She also said that she doesn’t mind public proposals, but for me, I do not want to be surrounded by people when I do so."
