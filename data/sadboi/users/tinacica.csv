Then the two parts moved away from each other and moved back together in a span of like seven minutes.  There was no planetic type of anomaly or whatever that day, I looked it up many times. 
The thing is, I had not believed in the christian God ever in my life. I do believe in something, but do not even know what, and that day didnt change that. It is just crazy. My Grandma acts like it is an everyday thing that god makes himself known in a sun miracle to believers."
architecture,foxruyo,t1_foudukp,1588154097.0,"Honestly I think you should be researching a lot more. Architecture is definitely something you need to be committed to fully if you want to get a degree, especially because it is not really like you think it would be like before starting your education.  People most of the time think that designing is always fun, that you design stuff that you want all the time. That is very far from reality and while architecture is most definitely a creative field, if you are not a star architect you can not design buildings just based on what you would like it to look. The emphasis is always on demand and function, and these two things generally create the shapes and look of a building. It is a lot more about discovering how a building can most effectively and esthatically serve its function.
A lot of my classmates fell out because they thought it would be just designing cool houses and were disappointed in the actual designing process.

My hair is its natural color though, so I might not be the person to converse about this but I am not even blowdrying my hair to make it more healthy.

She probably was out of the relationship with one leg and then turned the shame of being caught in a lie right back on you."
changemyview,fmgidii,t3_ftnoun,1586049750.0,"For me personally, it is mostly because I am a petite woman, and I know I am fucked if I get into a situation like that. It could even be a woman who’s much bigger than me, honestly."
changemyview,fmghohz,t3_fuic19,1586049290.0,"I study architecture and it would be impossible to measure our knowledge this way. Most of the assignments we have to do take days to finish and are sparsely spaced throughout the semester. These, and a lot of other exercises (of engineers, arts students among other things) could not be replaced."
scienceofdeduction,fmg7tt8,t3_fun5a9,1586043087.0,"Female. You have eczema or atopic dermatitis on your hands. You take birth control, you have a boyfriend or endometriosis. You play the ukulele. You are probably into skincare and Lush is nice, but they use too much fragrance, it probably causes flare-ups you dont even know about.
Either you travel a lot or have trouble sleeping generally.(Melatonin)
You are probably under 21, because you use nightly braces.
You live in Canada, as the brand of Melatonin you use is sold only there.
Probably near Toronto or Montreal, as Lush stores are only available in these two cities and one inbetween, and if you would have bought it on a trip you would save it up and not keep it on your bedside table."

TwoXChromosomes,fmg5qy6,t3_fuz4om,1586041837.0,"Don’t forget to delete your post history seven years later. Seriously. Today I spent one and a half hours deleting facebook posts from when I was 14, because I even forgot I made them and girl, they were ridiculously pathetic. Actual cringe material.
Also, learn to say no to people’s faces. Not just ghost them. Tell them no, and if they ask you why, tell them because just no. You do not have to give them explanations.
Learn to not care about other people’s opinions. You dont have to try hard to make them think good things about you, and if they only like you because you try, it means nothing.
Take care!"
TwoXChromosomes,fmg4wzd,t3_fuz2eo,1586041337.0,"I like how I look. Took me a few years to not stress on features that most people do not even see. Feels so good to just run to the store in my sweats and no makeup. It took me moving to a big city where you can do nothing without being seen by a bunch of people and having so much studying to do so that Id rather sleep then put on makeup, but Im there. I will not say I love everything, but I definitely dont want to change a thing."
AmItheAsshole,fmg38m1,t1_fmg209j,1586040324.0,"Some relatives live in Manchester, they get so much hate on a day to day basis its crazy. The kids are 15,17 and 19 now, they made friends with almost only other immigrant ( mostly polish and arab ) kids because the natives didn’t seem to like them. We are hungarian, for reference.
And also they are completely normal.  I also have relatives moving to other countries and now they are completely integrated in those countries society. 
Note that while the friends/family who moved to Germany/Great Britain/Austria spoke the native language, the ones who moved to Denmark/Netherlands/Sweden did not.
Also note that people hate living in Hungary and maybe I should leave too."
SuicideWatch,fmg02v8,t3_fure5q,1586038461.0,"Humans need something to work towards. They need a goal. So do you. I get that the only thing you want to do are gaming and reading (and sadly, dying) but the reason you feel useless and unfulfilled doing those things is probably because you have nothing to work towards. Nothing gives a person more joy than working towards their goals. Not achieving them, but working for them. The process of attaining something gives meaning to a life. I get you do not have motivation, as you do not even have a goal. People’s lives shouldnt be just fun. 
Find a goal, just a very small one and set it in your brain. Work towards it. When earned, set a bigger one. That could be just as small as working out a bit, searching for jobs online, searching for educational options or walking/playing with a family pet. Then reward yourself with gaming. Then set a bigger goal, and go on. Being productive makes a happier person. I am in no way a workaholic, but attitude towards work can change your whole life. I learned that the hard way, and if you succeed , you have had learnt that the hard way too.
You are a lot stronger than you think. 
Take care in these quarantine times!"
