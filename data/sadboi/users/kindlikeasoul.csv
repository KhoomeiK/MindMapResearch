Quiting was hard, one of the hardest things I had to do. It made me feel better when my life sucked. It got to the point when I would just do it when I was bored. Everything got switched around in my brain and I loved the pain so much. I could see what I was doing to myself but I didn't care. I didn't care that it could effect my health in the long run. I don't care that I might accidently go to deep and die right then and there. I just wanted my next fix. I tired to stop so it. Everytime I would get a few days or even a week in and I don't know who I was without it. My wrists would itch and I would just feel empty. So I'd relapse and I'd hate myself more. Week long stretches  became common. Then I'd make a month and a relapse. Finally I made it here. The addiction don't go away. I still get the urge to do it sometimes but it's better and easier. You're going to relapse a ton. Im not goig to sugae cost it. Its goig to suck and youre goojg to thi k youre going crazy. But you can do it. The best tool you have is conviction.

pointlesslygendered,f13vv58,t1_f12pn2v,1569166141.0,"Well grammatically speaking there isn't a unique  singular epicene or inclusive pronoun that can be used in the subjective case. Kind of a failing of the English language, but that's how it is. So, ""he"" is used in both cases and has for all of English history. Grammatical gender has always been different from actual gender. ""They"" is a plural pronoun, so grammatically speaking it is incorrect to use it to refer to a singular person. 
If you want to be grammatically correct and avoid using a feminine or masculine pronoun, ""he"" is the only one that that exists in English currently (it is used for masculine, epicene, and inclusive grammatical gender). 
Another option would be using the nuetor ""it"", but that implies that the child is neither male or female, but if that's what you're going for then by all means. 
The gender of a pronoun is derived from someone's sex not their gender, so it's totally fine to use masculine and feminine pronouns when referring  to a baby. You would not be 'gendering' the baby, just stating a biological fact. 
The best bet though is just to avoid the whole pronoun fiasco and use nouns to refer to the baby!"
