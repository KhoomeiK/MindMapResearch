Anxiety,fdkotwf,t3_elm4sm,1578508047.0,This is such a lovely post. My flying phobia is really overwhelming me at the moment and the news developing this morning has really thrown me
Anxiety,fdd273i,t1_fdc3bcx,1578291827.0,Thank you !
Anxiety,fdbwc5l,t3_ekjvfr,1578262826.0,I often can feel this way if I am going through a particularly quiet period of my life. I often wonder if it is because I am so anxious most of the time when I have plans and a bush work schedule that when my mind has no anxieties it doesn’t know how to be in a normal state!
flying,fdbjsi1,t1_fdbj6x4,1578258063.0,I did have reference of the horizon which looked like we were pointing downwards for a couple of seconds but I’m not entirely sure how long! It seemed to go very slowly!
flying,fdbjjdd,t1_fdbj91a,1578257970.0,Thank you for your reply! I took off from Mallorca mid afternoon

You could also buy a camera to watch them and then when they’re sleeping and not stressed you won’t feel guilty!"
