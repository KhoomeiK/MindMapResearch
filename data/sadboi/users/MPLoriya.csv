Som jag upplever det brukar public service dock vara hyfsat sparsamma med utpekande detaljer. 

Vad jag kan säga är att medieforskning påvisat att journalister gör i stort sett samma bedömning oavsett politisk färg.

Och eftersom anonymisering är just anonymisering blir det svårt att säga vilka partier som ligger bakom utan närmare undersökning. Men om tidigare statistik så är ju tendensen att SD-ledamöter är brottsbelastade i högre utsträckning, och då är det fullt möjligt att detta återspeglas i SVT:s och SR:s publiceringar.

Nu har jag inte undersökt något av detta, så det är bara rent spekulativt, och inte något jag kan ta gift på."

insaneparents,ffwdk78,t1_ffwd1zw,1580296744.0,"Not links, but here you go, two poop knives coming up:

""Wow, I shit you not, my family had a ""poop knife"". We didn't call it that, but we had a knife in the bathroom used for cutting poop. Our poop wasn't so big that it wouldn't even flush, but our pipes were really fucking small, so if the poop was big enough, it could easily clog the toilet and we'd have to use the snake to clear it. It fucking sucked. It happened so often, I swear we became just as proficient as plumbers at that shit. So one day, one of us decided to just use a knife on the fucker instead of taking our chances. It worked like a charm, so we kept the knife in a drawer next to the toilet. We'd clean the knife thoroughly every once in awhile (like, sterilizing it via boiling it).""

""My family poops big. Maybe it's genetic, maybe it's our diet, but everyone births giant logs of crap. If anyone has laid a mega-poop, you know that sometimes it won't flush. It lays across the hole in the bottom of the bowl and the vortex of draining water merely gives it a spin as it mocks you.

Growing up, this was a common enough occurrence that our family had a poop knife. It was an old rusty kitchen knife that hung on a nail in the laundry room, only to be used for that purpose. It was normal to walk through the hallway and have someone call out ""hey, can you get me the poop knife""?

I thought it was standard kit. You have your plunger, your toilet brush, and your poop knife.

Fast forward to 22. It's been a day or two between poops and I'm over at my friend's house. My friend was the local dealer and always had 'guests' over, because you can't buy weed without sitting on your ass and sampling it for an hour. I excuse myself and lay a gigantic turd. I look down and see that it's a sideways one, so I crack the door and call out for my friend. He arrives and I ask him for his poop knife.

""My what?""

Your poop knife, I say. I need to use it. Please.

""Wtf is a poop knife?""

Obviously he has one, but maybe he calls it by a more delicate name. A fecal cleaver? A Dung divider? A guano glaive? I explain what it is I want and why I want it.

He starts giggling. Then laughing. Then lots of people start laughing. It turns out, the music stopped and everyone heard my pleas through the door. It also turns out that none of them had poop knives, it was just my fucked up family with their fucked up bowels. FML.

I told this to my wife last night, who was amused and horrified at the same time. It turns out that she did not know what a poop knife was and had been using the old rusty knife hanging in the utility closet as a basic utility knife. Thankfully she didn't cook with it, but used it to open Amazon boxes.

She will be getting her own utility knife now.

[Edit: Common question - Why was this not in the bathroom instead of the laundry room? Answer. We only had one poop knife, and the laundry room was central to all three bathrooms. I have no idea why we didn't have three poop knives. All I know is that we didn't. We had the one. Possibly because my father was notoriously cheap about the weirdest things. So yes, we shared our poop knife.]"""
