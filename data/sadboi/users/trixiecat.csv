puppy101,fe5w5un,t3_env1j4,1578876295.0,"It‚Äôs SOOOO hard for us too in a similar situation. Almost every walk other than nighttime when less people and dogs are out is a training walk. Gotta work hardcore on stay and leave it. Always have treats on hand. Desensitize to areas walking back and forth a million times until not reacting. You have to notice all the bikes, runners, children, and dogs (those are what my girl runs to get at anyways) ahead of time and be prepped with treats in advance. I have my girl sit and stay if a super distraction like a kid on a scooter or running dog and just leave it with a treat in front of her nose for walking dogs. But I get out the treat when the distraction is 100-20 yards away and am prepared. I treat every 5-10 seconds and am working on increasing the interval. The really hard thing is the bike that comes from behind. If I‚Äôm not prepared she will probably lunge at the thing unless she‚Äôs busy sniffing something and distracted. Online training videos are really helpful. Also hiring a private trainer is helpful. But god those busy sidewalks on weekend days is really tough. Good luck!

Edit: forgot to add that I also periodically treat her for ‚Äúgood walking‚Äù with a loose leash and keeping pace with me. Show her what I like."
