Rapekink,fpeqifv,t3_gctrws,1588552794.0,"Look, we're all into some fucked up things here OP, but this was very worrying to read. If you have willingly chosen to be in a non-con relationship, you have to get something out of it too, or else it's just abuse. After raping you like that, the very least he could have done is give you after care and make sure you felt safe with him. It does not sound like he cares about you at all. There are no excuses for treating anyone like that, no matter how ""stressed"" he is. 

I would strongly advise to get away *now*. Go to a family member or a friend's house and figure out what you want to do. I've heard of too many cases like this where the abuse only escalates and it ends with actual murder. *Please* find a place where you can be safe, this is most definitely only going to get worse for you."

DeadBedrooms,fmrufmp,t3_fwwz9p,1586335857.0,"Unfortunately I am a LL girlfriend. But I knew this was gonna be a problem when I entered my current relationship because I struggle a lot with depression and self image issues. So to rectify it I first of all declared our relationship free use. He can have sex with me whenever he wants, even if I'm not in the mood or don't want to. We've got a safe word just in case, but I've only used it once in 3 and a half years. 

The other issue is we are long distance so I don't get to be with him too often and that makes the free use difficult, and I have a harder time being sexual over cam. So what I established then is that we were gonna be an open relationship. It takes sexual pressure off of me, and I still get what I want out of the relationship emotionally. 

I understand how important sex is in a relationship. Although there are many women like me, I have a lot of girlfriends who are HL. So although my libido is the result of a disorder, I still see myself as responsible for handling it. My boyfriend didn't enter this relationship to be sexless."

That being said, I prefer suffering through recession over my grandparents dying from a stupid virus, so we'll just have to deal with the consequences that come with society standing still.

AskWomen,fkneilh,t3_fjeak5,1584363611.0,"I'm from Norway, my father's side is American and my boyfriend is British so I experience cultural differences quite a lot. 


In the US, I've been cat called and made to feel uncomfortable quite a lot by men. I find myself feeling more wary of them. Whereas in Norway, you can experience the odd groping by a drunk dude, but most of the men I meet feels trustworthy, respectful and reliable. They treat you very similar to how they treat other men. It's very comfortable. 

My boyfriend is very mistrustful of other men. To me it feels like he always expect the worst of them and they often have intentions in his mind. In Norway, it is veery normal for men and women to mix on strictly platonic levels, and it's normal to have close friends of the opposite gender. My boyfriend finds this somewhat hard to grasp, and I understand why. It seems British boys don't have the same attitude.

Him and me experience quite a few cultural differences. Like he's raised around traditional etiquette. In Norway, we don't expect a man to hold the door for us, or get up to give us his seat and we always split the bill equally or just pay for ourselves. On my first date with him, I got upset because he *insisted* on paying the whole bill, whereas based on my values it was important to me to split it because I wanted to base my first date on equal terms. 

I don't even consider myself a feminist. Of course I support equality for all, I find that extremely important!! But what bothers me about what feminism has become, is that it leaves a lot of men (white straight particularly) at a disadvantage. Coming from a country where men truly deserves to be treated with respect and consideration, I want to fight for their rights too. I have yet to meet a man here who doesn't support women's rights, it's a given."

One time I was out past my curfew and I wasn't allowed a phone at the time so she couldn't call me to make sure I was okay, so she drove around looking for me and almost called the cops. She'd regularly call all of my friend's parents if she couldn't get ahold of me either. 

I knew all these things came from a place of love, but it was distressing to me to deal with her worry, so I'd make up white lies about things I knew she'd get worried about. I'm still a pretty convincing liar, but I've got more of a conscience for it now."
CPTSD,fki5nm9,t3_figknl,1584212405.0,"The reason I have a hard time caring about people is because I was forced into a very intense caretaker role during my mid teens.

I don't want to care about others because I'm so scared of being roped into, or forced to take on that caretaker role again. It was such a traumatic experience for me, I just try to avoid any situation that might result in it. 

I feel like I'm also a bit insensitive towards what people are going through although I do wish people could be happy most of the time. I just have this defensive, selfishness within me that thinks ""if I could go through what I went through and survive, you can deal with gaining some weight and feeling gross, Jessica"".

AskRedditAfterDark,fiq1b4v,t3_f92gfv,1582631589.0,"Yeah I'm friends with her. Mine isn't cute aggression, mine is just resentment. I just really struggle with my appearance, gotten bullied in the past over it even and this girl has no problem loudly addressing she think she's very pretty. That kind of confidence and self image baffles and saddens me because it makes me so aware I'll never feel that way about myself. Being friends with her has honestly made me feel a lot worse about myself.

She is really nice but she has no particular talents or skills (which is fine, not everyone needs to), but she's legitimately making a living off of Instagram at this point purely based on taking selfies. She's just that pretty people wants to give her money for it.

I get angry over her beauty because she's pretty no matter what. Of course in her insta pics, but also when I wake up next to her at a sleep over, when she hasn't showered in 5 days or when she's crying. She looks good in any clothing because she's skinny. I can't leave the house without makeup, and I spend way too long picking out the clothes I wear because I need to cover my rolls.

I know this resentment says more about me than it does her, but even if I was fit or slimmer, I'd never have that face. I know looks doesn't really matter and all that, but how I appear to others is so ingrained in my brain from comments I've gotten throughout my upbringing, I can't not care about it. It sucks to feel this way about your friend. I just constantly feel inferior and like I'm not worthy to even be around her."

I've gone to three different therapists in hopes they'd magically cure me somehow. It didn't help at all.

In realising I am the only one who can help myself while barely even having the will to stay alive... I wanted to try antidepressants because it's the only thing I haven't tried yet.

For me, it's that I absolutely *despise* the attention and me being the sole focus. I hate having to pretend like I'm happy and I get so stressed and anxious from all the overwhelming social interactions. 

I hate it because I isolate myself heavily normally. I feel a lot more comfortable and safe when I can restrict and control my social life and I choose who to interact with. I lose all of that during my birthday and it freaks me out. It's like an anorexic getting all this food stuffed in their face and being forced to overeat at the same date every year when they otherwise feel the need to have full control over their diet. It makes me feel like a trapped animal and it makes me want to lash out - whether it is towards myself or those around me. And my trauma has absolutely nothing to do with my birthday either.

traumatoolbox,fgq2wec,t3_ezme21,1581016844.0,"It's really strange, I have felt very similar to what you describe for many years, although I'm just unattractive. I am very sorry for what happened to you and that it has affected you so much. What you're describing definitely sounds like depression, but I assume you've already considered that.

My advice to you is to first of all seek therapy. One thing I've learnt is that I can't always pull myself out of these holes, and although I have someone to confide in, they aren't really qualified to actually help me. Professionals are who you want to see.

I'd also suggest trying to find different qualities about yourself that you actually do enjoy and build yourself up around that. From what it sounds like, you put a lot of your self worth down to your appearance although you weren't aware of just *how* much until now. You need to find something else about yourself that you can feel good about; whether it is how you treat others, being good at an instrument, being a good listener, enjoying photography or maybe even a computer software. Maybe you're good at handling dogs or cats? It doesn't really matter.

It would also be good to find a healthy coping mechanism. Art, music, cooking, Reddit posts, meditation, travelling... Somewhere you can feel free to express yourself so you don't have to walk around letting these feeling eat you up from the inside. 

Of course there is no easy way out of this, but don't focus on the big picture. You have to start somewhere, and taking small, seemingly insignificant steps is a lot better than taking no steps at all and giving into how your life is right now.

I am sure you will find joy again, and be happy within yourself. You just need to take a different approach to how you go about that now. As you said - you've changed. So what worked for the old you isn't going to work for the person you have the potential of becoming. 

I wish you the best of luck, just remember hat someone out there is always willing to listen and help!"

He only took about 20 seconds to test my internet, and then he was gone again. But I just broke down after that. Full on panic attack. I got so scared, I took my pillow and locked myself into my bathroom because that's the one lockable door that can't be unlocked with a key. I stayed there for 2 hours before I felt safe enough to come out.

It feels shitty since I haven't been with a girl before. I feel like I need to just to feel like a valid bisexual, like I have to prove it (to myself even). A part of me knows that's silly because a straight person wouldn't need to have been in a relationship to know they're only attracted to the opposite sex. They just trust what they're feeling. It's difficult to trust what you're feeling as a bisexual because what I'm attracted to fluctuates so much.

 All I know is that it's a lot fucking easier to get with guys than with girls. Girls are scary and no one makes the first move!!"

Most of the time, I don't even deny it or try to defend myself and I'll fully agree with the accusations. I deserve all the bad things happening to me right now.

I've been trying my best to get better and not burden him since. But that has resulted in me not being able to talk to him about how I'm feeling anymore, or anything serious for that matter.

abusiverelationships,fbaz4kz,t3_eccqfq,1576689893.0,"My ex boyfriend did this *a lot*. 

I stayed with him for 2 extra years because I was so afraid of being the reason he killed himself. 

I am now struggling with c-ptsd, which is fun. 

I broke up with him eventually because I felt like I couldn't live my life with all of his threats hanging over my head. At one point I just told myself that if he truly wants do die, then it won't be my fault. I spent 3 years selling my soul to him to make sure he wouldn't. I literally couldn't have done more, so if he *still* wanted to die after all that, then there was nothing I could have done about it in the first place. 

I let go of the responsibility I felt. He is a fucking adult. He is fully capable of understanding and making his own choices in life, and I can only influence those choices so much. But his life wasn't ever meant to be my responsibility.

So I told myself all this and broke up with him. He went from pleading to trying to pretend like he was really gonna be a healthy person now. Of course I was still worried he would kill himself, but guess what... 3 years have passed and he's still kicking about. He never fucking killed himself. Not after our breakup, not 3 years later. It was all just manipulation to keep me locked in an emotionally abusive relationship that demolished my mental health. I couldn't care less if he fucking died now. 

Do yourself a favour and let go of the responsibility and obligations you feel. If other people aren't capable of being responsible for themselves, then that's neither your fault not your problem, really. Please worry about yourself and listen to what you need. Breaking up with my ex lifted a massive weight off my shoulders, but the whole ordeal has still fucked me up even 3 years later. Please get out."
BPD,fb3iimk,t3_eba85b,1576474278.0,"For one or another reason, I've always struggled with acting humbled in front of my immediate family. This makes me upset about recieving gifts and whatnot. Ever since some stuff happened in my childhood, any kind of display of vulnerable behaviour or emotions I have in front of my family makes me feel like clawing my eyes out. It makes me *so* uncomfortable it makes me physically cringe. 

It's not because I'm not grateful, I just can't stand showing them mental weakness of any kind. Even if it's in the form of ""nice"" behaviours such as humbleness, crying or opening up to them. If I'm not my normal cold, controlled, and emotionally distant self in front of them, it makes me want to die from discomfort."

I hate running with a passion, but I too feel like I've not accomplished enough unless I run as well. 

I used to run for 20 minutes 6 days a week when I first started working out 3 years ago. I get periods where I relapse and don't go to the gym for months, and every time I got back to it, I hated cardio more and more. 

Now I can only stand doing 10 minutes. It's gotten to a point where I will avoid working out as a whole just because I know I have to do cardio.

I've considered trying to get into HIIT, but it scares me because sprinting really takes it out of me and my legs aren't super reliable. But I think I could manage doing 2 minutes of walking and 1 minute of sprinting to begin with. I think I need the variation to make it feel less insufferable, just going at the same tempo for 10 minutes is tedious and boring."

I was at the mall once and I had to rush into a toilet and have a 15 min panic attack because I caught a glimpse of myself from a bad angle in a store window.

TooAfraidToAsk,f425go8,t3_dj3xyf,1571327695.0,"I've done this a lot. My dad died when I was 10 and I had to face that very situation. It's something I hadn't ever imagined before that. Afterwards I got death anxiety myself and anxiety for any other close family members dying. 

I've often imagined how I would feel and what I would do if my mom died. I feel like my brain does it to kind of prepare me for another parent dying because 10 year old me was suddenly faced with the very real possibility of that happening. Ever since, I've always been very clear on the fact that mom's gonna die. 

That kind of mentality has somewhat taken a toll, though. She is the closest family member I have, but I feel like I keep everyone in my family at arm's length because of dad. I have a hard time expressing my emotions around my them, I'm always very collected and a bit cold. I feel extremely uncomfortable if I try to be vulnerable or show pure emotions to them. I only started saying ""I love you too"" back around the age of 18, because even that was too hard for me. But I started forcing myself to say it because I don't want them to die without having heard it at least."

 I used to be the victim of emotional abuse previous to my current relationship. My ex was suicidal and had a split personality disorder. I was basically more of a care taker than a girlfriend. He made me depressed because of how difficult it was to be with him and keeping him alive at the same time. I've basically become my ex in this relationship. Just being co dependent as fuck and constantly dragging my boyfriend down with me. But he's too Stockholm syndromed to leave me. I even tried to break up last year because I couldn't stand hurting him anymore, but we were even more miserable apart...

I honestly shouldn't be with anyone the way I am now. I don't have an ounce of positivity in my mind, I'm exhausting to be around. I'm not mature enough to be in a serious, healthy relationship. I've soured the greatest relationship I've ever had now."
