bipolar,fpuca9y,t3_gfks3z,1588909443.0,"Lately, I’ve gotten really into Wiccan chants and Wiccan chill music. Libana, Tina Malia and SJ Tucker are a few of my fave artists. During my most intense mixed episode, the albums “The Way I Feel” by Gordon Lightfoot, “Power Windows” by Rush and “All This Bad Blood” by Bastille were on repeat. Prog rock, folk, country and I suppose what’s classified as “world music” are my fave genres. 

I totally agree with your point about using music to express emotions. I send songs to people when I have a complicated idea that I can’t quite communicate with words. I also associate certain songs with certain people, even if said person has never listened to that song before. I just “sounds” like them!

One night we were at someone’s house and this friend stepped outside for a cigarette. I’m not sure why, but I was watching him smoke through one of the front windows. As I watched him, I felt an overwhelming sadness and a voice said “you will miss him when he’s gone.” Like your experience, the voice seemed to come from within and wasn’t an external hallucination. About 6 months later, that friend died in a motorcycle accident. I still don’t know what to make of that experience."

GhostAdventures,foih5mh,t3_g5l3vj,1587786538.0,"I’m convinced my parents’ house that I grew up in was haunted. It’s not that old, but there were 3 previous owners. The most significant thing I experienced there as a child was when my friends, my sister and I were playing hide and seek one evening. I ran upstairs, which was dark, to check for people hiding and in my dad’s den I heard a very distinct growl, like a dog’s growl. It gave me goosebumps on the back of my head. I will never forget that. Ever since that experience, that den became the center of the activity. My room was right down the hall from the den on the second floor (cape cod style house). I would wake up in the middle of the night to find my dad’s radio turned on when he claimed he made sure to turn it off. I would hear people screaming in the air vents, yet when I raced downstairs I’d discover no one in my family had been screaming. A ballerina music box my great-grandma gave me would turn on in the middle of the night, despite the switch being in the “off” position. I also had a very vivid nightmare that a psychic came to the house and told me that a young boy committed suicide by hanging himself in the closet of that same den. I’ve tried researching the house and tried to find any info on the previous owners but so far haven’t had any luck. All I know is when I moved out, the nightmares, feelings of negative energy and the eerie sensation of being watched stopped for the most part. I’ve had experiences at other places I’ve lived, but they didn’t make me want to leave and never come back."

Be proud of what you’ve accomplished thus far. You play music in a band, I think that’s pretty awesome! You have plenty of time to grow your career and find the right job. Don’t compare yourself to your gf; her life path is different than yours but it doesn’t mean yours is wrong, or that she will think you’re a loser. Bottom line: all you can do is be open and honest with her and yourself! Try to change your perspective on where your life currently stands and see it not as a shitty place, but as a place for growth and transformation.

Another time we were having a snack at the kitchen counter and she pointed out the sliding door at the deck and said “That’s Uncle Mikey’s!” I took her out onto the deck and asked what was his and she pointed to a lighter and said again that it belonged to Uncle Mikey. “Uncle Mikey” was a friend of my husband’s and mine who died in a motorcycle accident some 15 years prior. She’s seen pictures of him, but we have never referred to him as Uncle Mikey and have also never mentioned that he smoked. How would she have known this?! She doesn’t even know what a lighter is!

schizoaffective,ff7fnd6,t3_es0px3,1579648451.0,Yep!! To the point where I actually start to get depressed from the repetition!
bipolar,fepdvwm,t3_eq512h,1579318092.0,"When I was at my worst, the second voice in my head became a separate entity who would sometimes “take over” my consciousness. It was a different gender than I am, had it’s own name, personality and backstory, favorite music, etc. It was never negative except in the sense that it encouraged my delusions. For a while I wondered if perhaps I was gender fluid or something. Once I started taking antipsychotics, the voice disappeared. I actually felt lonely at first, like a big part of myself was gone. I’ve adjusted a little since then, but sometimes I still miss it. 

I wrote an entire book while manic/mixed with that voice as the main character. So I suppose there was a little silver lining there. Sometimes I wonder which one of us actually wrote it."

OCD,feih95o,t3_ep7owr,1579138492.0,"Yes, because the one in front is germy from everyone touching it. That’s my reasoning, anyway. Lol"
thementalparent,feih2ee,t3_ep4jiz,1579138366.0,"Try this next time someone is a bitch like that to you: smile and imagine how awful their own life must be for them to get irrationally angry at a stranger and do something like that. You just know that woman’s anger is eating her alive and she’ll be miserable for the rest of her day, and probably her life. When I encounter people like that, it’s what I do: smile and think “glad I’m not a bitter old piece of shit taking my anger out on others.” :)"
MissingPersons,feeszyt,t1_feejjnp,1579040566.0,Aw that makes it even sadder that his parents didn’t even report him missing because he was commonly gone. I didn’t realize it was a summer home and not an abandoned home.
MissingPersons,fee0pt8,t1_fee0bq9,1579023957.0,"I agree, it seems very strange that no foul play was suspected. If it was an accident, I wonder what lured him into that vacant house and gave him the idea to climb up into the chimney? Just the thrill of exploring an abandoned house?"

OCD,fe63aji,t3_ensa9n,1578880820.0,"Yes, my obsessions play into my delusions. I will get obsessed with a thought, whether good or bad, and it slowly becomes my reality. During those times I felt my rational voice fading and a bizarre “false clarity” as I call it, take over. The sense of false clarity convinced me to believe everything I was envisioning, despite all of it being completely fictional. For months I was living in a completely imaginary world and felt extremely detached or out-of-body, as you said. I’m not sure if that is quite the same as what you’re describing. I also have bipolar disorder and once I started antipsychotics, most of that disappeared."

schizoaffective,fdzxbua,t3_enedbc,1578798076.0,"I heard music a lot, especially in white noise. I would also hear fragments of my favorite songs on repeat in my head quite often. I heard one voice, he was very different from me. His voice would get more prominent the more paranoid I got. He wasn’t really negative, but he encouraged the delusions I had. Now that I’m on meds, I don’t really hear that stuff anymore. Honestly, I hope I don’t again."
