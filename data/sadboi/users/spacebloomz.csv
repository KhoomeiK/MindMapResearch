prozac,fp4mzxc,t3_g7qugf,1588302616.0,"Occasionally I'll find myself tripping over my words and saying something like ""I've- I've- I've- I've-"" but not a constant stutter"

AskReddit,fnezg8i,t1_fndihh5,1586898658.0,Not sure if anyone else agrees but I hate pens that glide super easily. I naturally have very shaky hands and my handwriting looks like straight up chicken scratch when I write with those nice pens. Cheap ones for the win
