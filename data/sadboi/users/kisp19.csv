Many there will say that no one should ever use hurt/hate to fuck you, but it seems from your story that your partner respected your boundaries even in spite of their emotions, so this exchange appears consensual despite the deep feelings behind it. That group may have some advice on how to initiate “hate sex” without the real honest to god hate, in safe ways (for baby), with consistent  aftercare."

But there’s not: it’s so individual and hyper specific to each person based on circumstance, personality, who you meet and when. I (F) was 27 before I lost my virginity—while I dated lots of guys short term, I never had a bf, because I never felt that connection or “spark” people talk about, or very comfortable in my sexuality. Finally I met a sweet guy and just made the conscious decision to end the drought. And at 30 I fell in love for the first time and had my first “real” relationship. It just happened—I couldn’t force it (and in the past, I tried). And I honestly feel no shame or regrets—everything happened in the timing that worked best for me as an individual. I used to feel so anxious about “being behind,” but now I feel like everything happened at the right time, in ways I couldn’t have possibly predicted at 18, 22, or 25."

infj,fgnj4q7,t1_fgnif17,1580945947.0,"Here’s what I’m not understanding : he asked not to be exclusive long distance as well. He said it didn’t make sense. That he didn’t want to do that if I was going to be gone longer than 3 months. We agreed — together, after much discussion — on this point. He then proceeded to pursue an exclusive, intimate relationship with me from that point while I was home, for 7 months. 
 
Who strung who along?"
infj,fgn1e8a,t1_fgn15mx,1580935831.0,"Then he lied to me for 7 months. That’s an incredible double standard from a person who demands truth and authenticity in all things, and hates to be “lead on.”"
infj,fgn17gw,t1_fgmd3gw,1580935724.0,"If what you’re saying is true, then it’s an incredible, jaw-dropping double standard. This person demanded truth and authenticity in all things—the greatest sin was lying to him. But (again, if what you’re saying is true), then he’s not beholden to his own standard. This person hates change, but is allowed to be radically changeable and without warning. This person values security, but what security can you offer a partner when truth, authenticity, and consistency are values you demand but can’t or won’t adhere to yourself."
infj,fglls5r,t1_fglkqn8,1580903626.0,He didn’t want to remain exclusive while I was away for 6-12 months. That was an agreement we made before I left.
infj,fglfw7e,t1_fgleegu,1580895655.0,"Sorry, I used the term “door slam” to mean any circumstance in which he would end communication with me and cut me out of his life, either from something I did OR because that’s what he feels he needs, regardless of my actions. I thought “door slam” was a term for any total cut off in communication from an INFJ, regardless of the reason. 

To give a little more info, I told him on our third date about the travel opportunity, that I was considering it, etc. We spoke about it from that point on, whether I should do it and how long I would be gone for, if we should be dating at all, etc etc. A little over a month in, we had a serious, defining conversation about what our relationship would look like both before and after I left, and we *mutually* agreed that we wanted to pursue an exclusive relationship prior to my going abroad, but since I would have no return ticket and no clear idea when I’m coming home (6-12 months from departure), that it would not make sense for us to remain in a committed long distance relationship in the face of so much uncertainty. We agreed—many times—to stay in touch. 

If he was confused or hurt about this arrangement, then he did not share his confusion or hurt with me for the next 7+ months of our relationship, and we had many, *many* conversations about where we were at and where we were headed. I had every reason to believe that we were on the same page."
infj,fglba5c,t1_fgla0f0,1580889185.0,"My plan was to return home (to the city where we both live) after this trip; unless something changes radically, that would still be my plan. 

It may be possible that I reach out in future. Perhaps our trajectories will align. 

Simultaneously, I know my worth as well. I won’t chase someone or compromise for someone who has proven they are unwilling / unable to do the same. 

I do appreciate what you’ve said. It’s given me a lot to think about."
infj,fgl8xtp,t1_fgl84cu,1580886299.0,"I think that makes sense—and tbh he’s expressed all of those things in some form or another in the last 9 months, so what you’re saying tracks. 

I am however struggling with the fact that, during the decision-making process of whether I should go or not, he was so adamant about me not staying for him that he said he would break up with me if I *didn’t* go. And also promised we’d stay in touch. I ultimately decided to go for lots of reasons, but these things were among them. It wasn’t as straightforward as walking away and leaving him hanging. He actively participated in this arrangement—but now I’m the one getting cut out."
infj,fgl81wp,t1_fgl69xc,1580885310.0,"Yes, he expressed that he never, ever wanted to hold me back from my dream. He was so adamant about it he threatened to break up with me if I *didn’t* go. It feels like a lose-lose situation : now I’ve gone, expecting we’d stay in contact, only to get cut off anyway."
infj,fgl7xwa,t1_fgl5mlf,1580885186.0,"The unfortunate part is, by cutting me off (and so quickly), it’s damaging the prospect of us ever renewing our relationship. So all those feelings just go to waste."
Anxiety,fcwg9bi,t3_ej29di,1578024844.0,"You are not alone. I felt this way for so many years, and still fall back into anxious patterns of thinking about it when I become stuck in a heavy routine / work schedule. I used to work 40+ hours per week for years in my 20s, and felt claustrophobic panic when I thought that this would just go on, for the rest of my life. Why? What was the point? What was the solution?

Here’s what gave me some much-needed space from “the grind”: I applied for a working holiday visa in New Zealand. This visa enables you to stay and work in the country for one year. It also covers work exchange, aka trading 3-4 hours of work per day (usually domestic or farm work) for room and meals. The visa is free for Americans (or at least it was in 2016) and arrived via email within 24 hours of applying. My friend and I were able to live very cheaply and travel the entire country for a year doing work exchange and working odd jobs (there are plenty of sites with jobs for backpackers and work exchange opportunities).  

You can’t get the visa after age 30. I was 27 when I applied—quite late in the game, but better late than never! It changed my life. I had so much free time to explore when doing work exchange. I had never before had an experience of owning my own time. When are we ever given power over our time? They put us in school and on a schedule from the moment we start to function like humans. And Americans don’t take gap years like so many other countries do.  But having  time—my own time—radically reoriented my life. 

Travel might not be for everyone—I never understood how anybody did it before I learned about the visa—but since you expressed an interest in travel, a gap year might be a worth looking into."

BDSMAdvice,eqtou94,t1_eqt6d9f,1560316059.0,"It does, thank you! I’ve been having practice conversations when I’m alone in my car. The only scenario I truly struggle to answer/speak to is when I imagine him telling me he’s not kinky AND couldn’t be in a relationship with me if I still wanted to attend this club or engage in this community. I know I’m riding the Hypothetical Anxiety-Driven Imagination roller coaster here, but if it came to that, it’s a tough choice - I want a meaningful relationship, and I also feel empowered by sexual exploration in this public, inclusive setting (while respecting that it’s not for everyone). But if that was his response, then maybe it would be a big red flag that we’re ultimately not compatible... 🤷‍♀️ 🎢
