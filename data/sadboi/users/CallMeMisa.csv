depression,eqrsgn3,t1_eqrrcwb,1560268779.0,I don't know anymore.. I just don't know.. How can my mom say things like that to me? How can she be so cruel?
depression,eqr6nvg,t1_eqr57rs,1560250776.0,"Yes. We are alone. Like my therapist says,  we are born alone and we will die alone but we don't need to live this life alone.

And I don't know him. But, we can always get to know each other. 

And, yes, I won't be able to be there physically. But. Emotional support counts too. 

So in a way, I'm not giving false hope. I am giving hope. If and only if I don't live up to it, it will end up becoming false. But, if I have the chance, I'll do my best to live up to it and be there for him. And you too, in case you ever need anyone."

depression,eqnnjr7,t1_eqnlm5i,1560178013.0,Thank you. T_T I'm so excited but I'm dreading my mother. She isnt supportive about this career path. ðŸ˜…
depression,eqlckv5,t1_eqkk5yu,1560141762.0,Oh and about my boyfriend. We talked it out. It's just... We both have issues. Shit ton of those.
depression,eqlc5j2,t1_eqkxquf,1560141499.0,I guess...  I used to look up to her. And now I don't
depression,eqlc3j6,t1_eqjri4a,1560141465.0,"I'd say it's probably because I am not like her. You see, my mom was this really active and strong willed person when she was of my age. So. Unlike me, she didn't lose hope. And I do. And she hates that I do. It's just an assumption but it's the only one that seems logical."
depression,eqlbqdg,t1_eqkk5yu,1560141238.0,"Thank you for this long reply. Really. Sort of makes me feel validated that someone has taken such a long time to type out something for me. 

Thank you for complimenting my English skills. I enjoy this language and feel comfortable speaking in a language my parents aren't as fluent as I am. Kind of gives me a privacy. Sort of. 

Now, as far as the ""Very intelligent"" thing goes, my IQ, on pen and paper, is 112 while I only use 95 of it and it's declining. So apparently in a way, I am shutting down my brain, my thought processes because I don't want to deal with people,problems and emotions.

Discipline. Oh dear. That is something I can't maintain. You see, I have this cycle. It starts out with me falling in love or giving my all in a relationship, be it a relationship or a friendship. Then I get hurt. Then, I drown in self pity. Then, I stand up and start pushing myself. Studying for 16h. Studying and sleeping. Scoring a shit ton of marks. Losing all my friends. And then, I stop it all. I start slacking and I fall in love or give my all to someone. Again. 

I am not proud of it. I wish I can just study 4h a day. Every day. But I can't. I can't study when my parents are home. My mother and father scream at each other. They pull me into their drama. And as if that wasn't enough once in a while. My parents decide I need to be disciplined so I get slapped and pulled by my hair. So, when they are home, I'm always on the edge. I just can't concentrate. My therapist says it's the PTSD from all the childhood issues that happened with me. I trust her on that. 

Now, as far as the ""Get a degree and gtfo"" is concerned, I'm not an overachiever. I am basically trying to find something to distract myself with. And, you see, I can't openly be distracted with my relationship because my parents would get rid of my boyfriend. So, instead, career it is. And fear not, dear stranger, I won't end up a workaholic. I just want to work as much as it is required for me to get away from my parents, out of this country and end up together with my boyfriend. 

I know how you feel with the video games, music, porn and web surfing. Because, I am doing the same. I don't want to waste my time. But I just can't help it. 

If you ever want to talk, please feel free to message me. I'm not saying I'll reply instantly because I tend to isolate myself. But I can promise you, I'll reply. 

Good luck to you too, friend."
depression,eqjnkmf,t1_eqjjzzk,1560108260.0,"Yeah.. I know.. My mother reminds me once a week, how ashamed she is of me because I self harmed. How ashamed she is because I couldn't crack two competitive exams. How everyone teases her. She insists on calling me a dumb bitch, a whore and all other nasty words she can think of.. I don't know what to do."
