No he wasn't perfect and want there when I needed him the most when my dad was dying. We had 20 years together...love at first sight when we were young then tightly bonded once we got together. I can't stop thinking about how miserable I've been without him. Being hurt and angry over his own mistake in leaving me to manage alone with my father's illness wasn't worth being this unhappy
All i do is ponder how I could track him down and talk like we used to. How he was never able to resist me. Being that well liked as well as loved. It's all so stupid now out of all the problems so many other couples have. 
I daydream that I'm back in my home we bought together. No one has ever compared both looks wise or to hang out with. Passion and friendship were awesome. Didn't think I would feel this lonely"

Not sure if this will flush the body quicker but I still believe it's a good idea regardless.

It sounds ridiculous and I'm well aware of the damage all the Tylenol causes. I've managed all these years to keep my liver healthy with herbal supplements. Honestly Ive had hellish days from running out of T1's after taking them so many years and I was so afraid of even worse wd from PST. Needn't have worried. I often wondered what others meant by nods and ""getting buzzed''. Maybe mild relief. Frankly I only kept buying more thinking I didn't want to go through worse.

AnxietyDepression,f54hhvg,t3_dms1kk,1571982578.0,"Since I was 4 I've been surrounded by all sorts of pets and farm animals. I had to live without this when starting out...first university, then first job and apartment. Didn't go for long before getting my own cats then dogs. 
If it helps, you must grasp they are animals and not to apply human emotions or reactions to any pets. To truly love another species, you invest in learning their language and there's such rewards when you do. This cat isn't rejecting you. Maybe not even the food either. If it's sort of a stray, it may be feeling poorly. There might be something outside that's spooked it or sees as a threat recently. Seeing the world through another's eyes can take you outside of your inward world and thoughts and create such healing. 
My own world had grown so small. After injuring my back badly, years fighting to be believed and finally have the surgery I desperately needed...all it consisted of was puttering around my apartment. Houseplants, trying to come up with stuff to make my life worthwhile unsuccessfully. Having cats got me involved with a local rescue. When I got my first real home I adopted my dream dog (Great Dane) and I began doing things way outside my comfort zone. Talking to strangers. Having studied pet nutrition and training people would ask me for help. How to deal with hard to treat illnesses like allergies, chronic illness like liver disease. How to train an excitable dog to walk on a leash. Only from the love of studying animals closely. Frankly the first glimmer started with a stray cat. Happy healthy but sadly had leukemia after I had her a year. This for me in touch with a guy who had been treating this death sentence disease with homeopathy and natural remedies. No guarantee but was the only chance the vet could offer. Sadly I wasn't able to save her life but it started a lifelong learning for me. 
All I can say is how much bigger my life felt when I saw it through shared experiences with my dogs out on hikes, training off leash. Me, the chronically and painfully shy chick who grew up in the middle of nowhere. More comfortable with animals than people (still am). I was gifted the chance to push past my fears and connect with people through animals. By seeing them as each individual personality inside the species. 

Anyone can connect with an animal and it doesn't have to become the lifelong obsession it did for me. But it will help you understand yourself more once you understand what an animal is really trying to tell you"

Thing is, when you're gone from peoples live a long time you are forgot. Times I wonder why I bother having a phone since no one contacts me since I've moved. I've gone months without uttering a word to another human. Once you actually truly disappear, it looks very different than you would have thought and it's an ""alone"" you may not have anticipated"

I suspect it may have been the same thing with the last most tragic death. Bloat or torsion is what killed my last and there's little you can do once it's happened so it's not your fault. I took great care of mine and 1 survived bloat and 1 didn't. She progressed so quickly I didn't have time even to get her into the car.

Trusting the wrong person with my money thus future...losing consistent access to my own vehicle so I'm not able to even leave this new place I was forced to buy (and hate). Maybe it's keeping me bitter yet me without animals is a lost soul. Don't think I could survive disconnecting from them or I wouldn't have any reason to get up at all. Hell I wouldn't have anyone to even talk to if it weren't for my dogs. Funny how old friends drop away once you leave your home town and can't travel back much. Makes me wonder how solid any friendships with people are compared to ones I have with my dogs. Big let down while I've gone through tough times....people vanish."

AnxietyDepression,f06s85y,t3_d3tck1,1568444639.0,"Man, I do understand that because I've hung on to mine through some very dodgy rough times financially. It's a hard call. I had found my solitary life turned into such rewarding times once I adopted my 1st, then another. I was a great deal more secure when I began to develop my larger pack. I came out of my shell as I got a reputation for being a good trainer. I got out tons more and actually spoke with people I never would have before having my dogs. They are Great Danes too so the financial commitment is huge. So when I lost most everything, my world was coming apart but I couldn't imagine my life without the ""people"" that filled it with constant joy.

I hung on and can tell you the immense strain of worry it carries. What if they get sick beyond my skills to heal them and they have by times. I've gone without food and can't remember the last time I wasted money on stuff like having someone else cut my hair or bought nice clothes. I scronge to provide the best I can which means quality foods and as much time and physical effort I can manage to ensure their health and happiness. They are there for me BUT....you have to be fully prepared to be there for them. It's not a lopsided relationship because that's not fair. Yes I have really bad weeks when I don't train and exercise as much as they need but that's the limit of what I will make them sacrifice for me. I've borrowed in emergencies for vet bills. It's not easy and you constantly ask yourself ""can I do this and am I being fair""..…it's like being a parent in some ways. 

On the other hand you don't have to dish out big bucks for pricey grain free food. I've studied cat and dog nutrition and holistic therapies for 30 plus years and know without a doubt the average per does not need trendy foods. They should eat crap food but healthy grains in decent food are a natural part of their diet. It just takes a huge commitment is what I'm saying now that I've fallen from upper middle income to low. I'm not keen to hear a dog spend 10 hours home alone without another human to fill it's time and mind. You'd have to think long and hard on that if that's all the time you will have to give and haven't resources for trusted doggy daycare or someone to drop in during the time your at work. I've been a volunteer for 25 years in 2 breed specific rescues and I know it's a prerequisite to adoption and especially fostering (where pets can heal and learn how it is to live in a home that is safe). I don't want to come off sounding harsh or negative. You may indeed have resources that don't have to cost much money to provide these. 

Depending on where you live too, there's a desperate need for volunteers to take rescue dogs for walks, to socialize them and the bonds you can make are more impactful than can be imagined. Some dogs in no kill shelters are ""lifers"" meaning they will never be suitable to be rehomed but will be cared for for the rest of their lives. People that take the time to visit them regularly so they aren't just seeing staff alll the time help so much and the dogs change and help you too. There's a world of healing that comes from relationships with dogs. Try and find a scenario that does the most good for you and a dog. I say this as a person that can't live without them. I don't relate easily with people without a dog by my side. Strange how you then begin to meet like minded people and don't feel so alone. 

Good luck. Hope I could show the good and the reality in a way that doesn't discourage"

Needafriend,exglp78,t1_exfh0kb,1566267312.0,"I think it's all too easy to attach to the thing we used to do when we had the most happiness and get this internal resistance to throwing ourselves into something else that could be quite wonderful. Stuck well and good in the past. I sure am after losing it all. I used to do charcoal portraits, write a bit and found such a sense of pride working with powerful dogs. To do things most people would think a bit mad. At my heaviest I was 230lbs, then adopted my first Dane. I had a man I adored and for the first time, found I could smile that true almost childlike smile (Danes can do that for you). Year one, I just didn't want to let down the trust I of the rescue or my dog so I walked as fast as I could every day with winded smile. Every single day until we were up to 5 miles. Then I got a bike, taught my boy to work with it....next was trick riding and obstacles. All I could think was ""Me, the girl that despised gym"", wow. I was now 130lbs and got another Great Dane. Hiking and just loving every moment of freedom all on my own. The confidence boost was enormous. Long story but I lost my marriage, let my husband have our home. Loaned what ended up being my life savings to another man with the promise if I helped buy another large home away from my hometown/ friends/ all the places I could train dogs...that he would fix it up and sell to pay it all back. Been struck here 8 years in the worst area for me and never have the freedom of using my own vehicle to escape back home to stay part of the community. It's just been a misery I have yet failed to adapt to find ways of doing anything I used to. I hate living inside all the time with a mere 40 min walking route dodging traffic on foot. 

It's so frustrating to see where you are failing but not able to sort out the solution. Easy to feel weak and like I'm making excuses all while carrying loads of resentment bordering on hate for this man who never had any skills let alone money to back up all his promises. That's my trap. Hatred and wishing I had never let him stick his nose into my life. He took everything away from me that I loved. 

Now the question is, how can I deal with and move beyond negative emotions to pull my personal shit together. To get back to being fit and back in control of what little I do have. I think it may be a bit similar to what you're struggling with. Just trying to find a new way to feel the way we used to. As happy as we were but in a different place and time"
Needafriend,exf9wni,t3_cs92ad,1566235935.0,"I don't know how this works either. Just stumbled on this group today and thumbing through so many younger people, wasn't connecting awfully much. Thought maybe if I saw an over 40 age group post ....
At any rate, though younger I relate to what you're saying. It can be a trap that can take most of your life to barely break free of. Feeling so different and not having good reactions in the past from people. While for me, it wasn't anything as complicated as being gay or anything like that (as far as being different). Just ""weird"". Grew up more rural than most of my schoolmates. Moved from an extremely remote part of the world, 200 MI north of Whitehorse,  Yukon, Canada. I was always""that girl that lives in the middle of nowhere"" with my hike out to catch the school bus daily. I might have seen another kid my age maybe once a year until going to school and I wasn't at all prepared for all the noise, smells and garbled""baby talk"" compared to how me and my siblings were taught by our mom. We lived with timber wolves and bears so squeals and screams weren't absolutely forbidden as kids.... unless we were in true danger. My parents were much older too than others my age so I always stood out at school concerts and such .. mine were the silver haired parents in the crowd. 
I was used to solitude too. My sibs were older so I didn't have playmates, only 60 acres to wander around on my own. Sounds pretty cool and it was but very lonely. You try to quietly insert yourself into a group, very insecure and they sense how different you are so veer away or pick on you relentlessly. 

Fast forward through solitary years in school and being rightly trigger shy of putting yourself out there only to be shot down. You become even more reclusive if you don't find something...a passion or interest that puts you in contact with people with similar interests. I was 45 before I discovered a passion for Great Danes and dog training and rescue. Its not much but it started to bring me out of myself. I only hope you don't have to wait so long. It can be a tenuous thing and all it takes is a divorce that takes you away from all you've known and friends you've made...a death or 2 of a close friends and you can find you're back to feeling quite alone again. 

Don't know what you have or or capable of doing but I sure hope you don't let stuff like this go on for decades the way I did. I didn't know how fast the years go by and how much I had isolated myself by letting my shyness lock me into a life long pattern"
depression,exe3kr8,t3_cs2ogj,1566196801.0,"It's really kind of helpful and interesting the hear so many stories of how relationships have such power over us....whether in one or lost one. Especially from the opposite sex as we get older as well. My parents are gone and though kind they were distant, hard working people and I felt so lonely as a child. You think, when I grow up I can finally meet a man and get married. Have kids and finally find my place in life. Trust me girls are very naive and think it's always about love and ""the one"". At least that's my experience. 

I did find my ""one"". Most amazing man the began like some lusty romance novel. Love at first sight and the whole thing. Couldn't slip a piece of paper between us and we preferred each other's company to others. Best friends, awesome sex for 20 years. But Yup...I lived for him. Had that fear I would fall apart broken if I ever lost him.  He was flawed and just bad timing....when my dad was dying of cancer he had his ""I don't know what I want"" moment.  We had bumps along the way but this one caught me so off guard I made the worst mistakes by not having any room to forgive. Left myself open to someone looking for a younger woman with new wealth (from my fathers estate) . Listened to the whispers ""you deserve to be treated better"".  Long story short, I ignored my gut telling me to stay and work things out (with much manipulation) and lost the only person that meant more to me than myself. Been fighting the good fight saying ""I think I can I think I can"" til I've started to spiral further down into depression and seeing no point in living. I'm more alone than I've ever been in life. 8 years have passed and I can't stop saying how much I still love him each day to myself. People say just let go and move on as if it's simple. I never got to know why we split up or say goodbye even. He was off finding himself and I just up and left the home we bought together. Like he was going to wait more than a year before someone came along and moved in with him. 

When days are filled with regrets and grief, it's so hard to find a reason to go on. My life savings gone to the man I'm shackled to until I can find some way to get it back, even half to start again someplace else far away from this old creep that stole my life away.  That's how I feel. The lies told and promises made. Didn't even know he was mostly impotent until drugs stopped working. Not that I can bare the thought of him touching me these last 7 years. Not after learning all the lies. I'm sorry for belching out all this stuff on someone's post. It's something to have at least that sense you most not let down the ones who love you. My own stupidity made sure I don't have the last person who did love me and I just don't know how I'm going to face life alone without him. Nothing is better than being with someone who actually wants to grab your hand and lace fingers. Know your thoughts without speaking.  Guess I was lucky I found someone like that and lived 20 years together. Wish it didn't feel like the end of feeling any joy. Wake up and grope through each day over and over again"

I cried hearing the sacrifice and love your father shows. I understand hating to say help me please. I can only imagine what having that kind of love from a dad. I hope there is a way to truly feel what that kind of love means. I know you do but simply from my perspective- mom died when I was 28 and still not settled into having a family (I never did). Dad died in 2010 and he no more wanted me around then he did as a child. Honestly the only person that made home feel sort of like a welcome retreat if life became to much was my quietly suffering mom who never had the courage to stand up for me against my fathers cold idea of child rearing. 
To have a clearly loving father or parent who would lay down their life.... How much a comfort that could be   

I'm in no way saying you don't appreciate any this. Yes I envy it. It's not about comparing how bad anyone feels. I'm just so glad you have this man in your life.

depression,ex2yiep,t1_ex2hxwa,1565977342.0,Yeah I get so much worse. I used to enjoy the occasional puff quite well but since anxiety and depression got a hard grip on me I dare not.

Animals have always been what grounds me and in later years I met more like minded people both as a volunteer in rescues and as a dog owner. Since you'll be busy and away from home so often maybe owning a pet isn't the best idea. What about volunteering at a shelter. If that's something you'd be into that is. Whether it's cleaning or even better- dog walking it can be a great way to connect with people and have the calming affect of animals. Just a thought
PoppyTea,ewvehgv,t3_cp5vwo,1565804598.0,"It's just nuts that real options are held back. It wasn't a cure all but had I not had my back surgery, no pain relief in the world would have been enough to survive through that kind of intense searing pain. I've heard many say they wouldn't go anywhere near a scalpel but imo I think orthopedic surgeons might not have the success rate that neurologists do. I was lucky that way I guess. I was blown off by orthos but after 3 barely livable years saw one of the top neuro surgeons. I went from being unable to move my legs and feeling like one leg was being deep fried in boiling oil to merely having ""chronic"" back pain. No not a cure but close as they could get me to 
Living with free health care helps but it seems to rely on doctors giving a shit and not withholding surgical options when they could help.

PoppyTea,ewubvkm,t3_coe2gl,1565774117.0,"I do see your point. Some decent doctors admit they feel their hands are tied. The experience I had as a direct result of doctor arrogance....I've seen the very worst in some doctors. All it took was 1 doctor to make an informed snap judgment and note on my file ""drug seeker"". This was in the early fight to be properly diagnosed with major damage the my spine and vertebra. The trickle down affect was that every doctor or nurse afterwards treated me like a criminal. Having broken facets, herniated disc and fractured vertebra already noted on the first CT scan . . with a note ""surgical candidate"".
To this day I have no clue why it was shelved or ignored. What I can tell you is only a brief snippet of what I lived through - Months of physio which made it worse then a sudden pop and no feeling from my waist down. I lived like this for months in an apartment with my fiance out of his mind with terror. Since I no longer could walk or void anything he finally drove me to the hospital that refused to do anything all this time and insist they take me because he wasn't taking me home

The result- I was put on a ward in medical for awhile while all pain relief was withheld. They refused to believe I couldn't pee or shit so I was forced to do the unthinkable and disimpact myself in the bed I was confined to and wash my hands with wet wipes. Refused to bathe me (no bath in 5 months by now). I was drug by 1 arm to a bathroom and forced to sit on a toilet then dropped on my bed with such disgust they left bruises all over my arms. Finally the transfer me to a mental ward where you don't eat if you can't make your way to the dining area. All good kept being removed from my room the my fiance tried to smuggle in. More dragging me across the floor by my arms to shame me into getting up. 

I can't remember all of what happened to me because I was in a nightmare of pain and malnutrition. By the time one kind doctor from my past came to visit me and get me out of there and rushed into surgery I had dropped from 160lbs to 113lbs. I had thrush in my mouth and it took a long time to rid yeast from my bloodstream. Vitamin injections 

Not one of those assholes ever apologized for making a mistake. All based on this assumption that people who come for help in extreme pain MUST be seeking drugs ....not to be fixed. The woman in the bed next to mine where I had my surgery came from the same town I did. Chronic migraines was her problem. Same story but...she had an inoperable brain tumor. I don't think she even made it out of that hospital. 

So I do blame some doctors"

On my worst days or when I have to make an appointment on time I freeze up mentally and it's a constant unmoving fight to accomplish anything. When I most need the be organized I fail terribly. The more pressure on me the more I overthink myself into immobility. The mind gets racing so it would isn't able to settle on one step at a time.

AnxietyDepression,ewm4hpc,t1_ewm1ede,1565543000.0,"Oops I cut myself off. It feels frighteningly lonely. I stopped looking at Facebook mainly for how painful it is to see most my old school mates with grandkids now. I may be in a pseudo relationship (how I see it) with a man who talked me into leaving my own home when my husband took off. It's shallow and empty compared to the love I shared for 20 years with my husband. Off topic but this man I don't think he ever loved me. Just needed someone's financial support so he could leave his own bad marriage (my dad died and left me a large sum). I left my marriage and home far too soon without seeing I had nothing in common with this older man but now all my money is gone to loans to him...I'm locked into a life living together with no way out

All the bad mistakes I've made....not having a child was top of the list. It haunts me constantly and I would have made a good mom. Had so much love to share. Think long and hard about how different life can look in 20 years before doing anything permanent 
If I could go back and talk to my younger self and warn her not to just let things drift and to hold fast while my husband went through his own meltdown. I would still be home one way or another. Now I'm going on to 54 this fall and still can't believe just how much I've failed at life. So lonely and miss my soulmate and my home where I had some friends. 23 is so very young and I'm sure you hate hearing that. I remember I was a very depressed teen and into my 20's and it seemed like time dragged on. Couldn't shake feeling something good will happen someday. Nothing just happens to make life better all by itself. What a horrid realization. Personally I can't believe how dumb I was and naive. It never occurred to me that I could just go ahead and create a situation or goal rather than wait for it to happen to me. In fact the only thing I really fought to get was my husband. I was in a very abusive relationship when we met and Bam...love at first sight. Corny but it was a silly amazing love story that led to 20 amazing years together. Both so dramatic. Except I forgot that while my dad was dying of cancer and my husband went into his own early midlife crisis. I knew he was dramatic and used to make allowances for this but I simply wasn't up to it while burying my dad. 

Sorry I rambled all over the place. Look you're very young and I'm just warning how easy you can set yourself up for a life of regret if you're not careful. I was a total introvert and very depressed young person. I know it feels like it will never change. I did when I met the man I loved and I had those 20 years. I even learned how to cope better with depression by involving myself in animal rescue and fostering dogs. Have my life more meaning than what I invested in a man (bad trap to fall into). Find you ""thing"" that you can hang onto all on its own, independent from any single person. These are things I wish I could tell the younger me because I'll admit. I invested way too much of my soul in my husband and still haven't recovered from losing him. Yes, were it not for my dogs I would have likely killed myself. 

I envy those girls that put school first and made a career. I envy those girls who were brave enough to go for it when young and have their kids. I wasn't brave and hoped happiness could be found in another person. I t can but if you lose them where does that leave you"
AnxietyDepression,ewm1ede,t3_cory00,1565540924.0,"I know having kids isn't for everyone but I hope you don't do anything permanent so young (like tying your tubes). I can't say this from experience only common sense...how you responded to babysitting your sibs is quite different that how you respond to the responsibility of your own child. 
I didn't think I wanted a child well into my 20's. Then my mom died suddenly and something woke in me. Don't think it was from simply missing her because I gave it a couple years to make sure it wasn't just grief. Still I figured I was young and had time. Was with a man who was the light of my life but being a couple years younger (and his own baggage) decided to wait until he seemed ready. Years drift by as they do and you can forget just how much time slips by so fast. 
The moral of my story is....I can't have a child anymore....my husband walked out during crisis of his own. I ran away out of hurt and he moved on with someone younger who had her kids already. I'm left alone with most of my family now gone and no children to have formed part of my future. To never have been a mom"

I may be disabled but I'm vain as well and that added tummy fat likely won't help my low back (or overall health). It may sound contrary talking about staying healthy and using PST but I suspect there's a lot of folks here using it for the same reason as me- no access to pain management/ needing to stay mobile to reduce pain. I would love to see a thread here talking about what others do to stay as healthy as possible while coping with extreme and chronic pain. Pain opens the door to depression and poor health   
It's become so ""in my face"" as I've recently gone from a size 8 to 10 with the mid-drift jiggle. We do so much to try to manage tolerance (taking breaks etc), curious what else other do (supplements or what have)"
PoppyTea,ewdussx,t3_cnr9t4,1565308077.0,"I'm impressed by the restraint of many other chronic pain people here. I know myself the kind of humiliation I've gone through in the 30 years since becoming disabled, trying to seek help. We get it from doctors, pharmacists...then to hear other people who make rude comments like ""oh I hate to take pills so I just suffer through it"". We know these people haven't experienced long grinding/ driving incessant pain...not really or they wouldn't say such ridiculous things. 
When you don't have any other options and try desperately not to let PST manage us rather than the other way around. To hear someone say this is merely an excuse is insulting. We make a choice- pick which days we can sacrifice to pain and not take PST in order to limit the tolerance. The weight of what's at stake and to behave responsibly. None of us wants to add severe addiction to their lives which are already so hard while dealing with chronic pain. It scares me to the core which is why I never take it lightly. I'm sure I'm not alone in this."

Good luck"
depression,evdc81c,t3_cjf3go,1564434850.0,"Finally (sorry if that sounds insensitive). Someone my age with similar burdens weighing down your life so heavily. I do understand very well from a female perspective. Except I thought I had more time which seems to be a common human condition. 
I tried to be the first and only one in my family to go to university. Even went back to high school to get into a program I was interested in. It was hard but I thought this was going to change my life for the better. Got a boyfriend, got so distracted when he broke it off I blew my 1st term exams. Made it through the 1st year on a student loan when my dad had to retire with heart problems and lost my student loan (mom went back to work so income was too high to qualify). I leaned on this excuse since I couldn't seem to handle working and going to school   
Went to work in chicken plants because the money was the best for a woman in my area. Met the man of my dreams and married for 20 years. In our first year my mom died so young of a massive heart attack (when depression got its grip on me).  Hit my 30's and my husband wasn't ready for kids so I set it aside for ""awhile"". Time goes by so fast. Before I know it we had bought a home and still figured there was time for a baby. Then my husband decided he needed a break to see if he wanted to stay in the marriage. He did this every few years but I always made allowances because of his troubled childhood. 
However this time happened while my dad was dying of cancer and I didn't cope well. I gave up out of anger and fell for a bullshit story by some other man. Thought I would have a fresh start and maybe at 48 I could still have a child. Nope too late. 

In my case I was guilty of being too passive. I let myself coast and didn't achieve much other than flush away my marriage that meant more to me than anything else. Signed away all rights to our home out of pain. So disappointed with myself to be 53, childless and my parents both gone. Lost what friends I had when I moved away with this other man along with my life savings. I let myself make dumb choices that left me alone and so unhappy rather than fight for something that made me so happy. 

Looking ahead at growing old with no children or grandchildren. Knowing my much older siblings will likely pass away before me and I will be alone when my time comes. It's so frightening. I so wish I could go back and do it over but you can't can you. 

All I can suggest is if you have a bond with your wife, cultivate it as much as you can. That's just me but lacking that connection with someone you've shared years of moments with, I can say it's shitty to lose it. Unless you have something really rewarding to turn to to start over, make what you have count"
AnxietyDepression,evd8w4d,t3_cjeg2o,1564432710.0,"I wish I knew the answer. Going on 8 years since my husband and I split up and I'm still grieving the loss of my best friend and soul mate. I can't stop looking back at all the moments we had to slow down and work it out but plunged headlong into the worst mistake of my life. 
I've tried making a go of it in another relationship but hide just how much I wish I could turn back the hands of time and be waking up to see those gorgeous brown eyes that could read my moods and thought like no other. We cut all contact both of us out of the raw pain we both felt and now I can't find any way to get back in touch to even see if he still feels the same ...only regret for giving up on the best love two people ever shared. The laced fingers even after 20 years of marriage when so many other couples just seemed to tolerate each other. The passion. 
Anything else since seems false"
PublicFreakout,ev1xixu,t3_chnvov,1564166851.0,"I've worked in rescue for years. So many bite attacks go unreported and pits get will always get the press attention. It's too late by the time they reach this point but so many ignore these dogs are not born this way. Irresponsible owners that refuse to train, provide secure fenced yard and leave dogs unattended. 
We hear more unreported attacks in rescue than what hits the news. As a breed becomes popular there's a surge in unscrupulous breeders happy to make a profit with zero regard for breeding ethnically. It also corresponds with attacks by that popular breed due to reckless breeding/lack of raising balanced socialized pup. The public never heard about it when labs or retrievers or poodles hurt people in attacks. 
I've personally been attacked more times by small toy breeds. I do own Great Danes so training has always been my main priority. More times I see how people fail to train ""cute"" little dogs. They have been the bane of my existence in socializing my own dogs. I've cracked my skull on the pavement being tripped up by ankle biters, a broken nose and ear almost ripped off once I hit the ground. 

My point is simple. We are quick to kill a dog after its lived in an insecure environment yet fail to be able to nip this in the bud long before a tragedy happens. Perhaps law enforcement isn't given enough power to remove or fine owners who leave dogs chained outside or in an insecure yard while they aren't present. Animals shouldn't be put in this position and it's no surprise you end up with a problem dog if you make no effort to take proper care of it. We think we all have the divine right to have a pet even if we have no interest in training it. Then we have the power to kill it because an owner failed it. I see this as so wrong though I see no option once it's injured a person or another pet. They aren't the bad guys....it's they people that owned it. We should feel only guilt and sadness when a dog has to be destroyed"
AnxietyDepression,euxzf5c,t1_euxk2zd,1564093603.0,"I responded so poorly to 3 different SSRI's my old doctor kept me on a more traditional antidepressant but yes.... I was on fairly high doses of both for at least 10 years. Mirtazapine at 120mg a day and 4 to 6 mg of clonazepam. When I asked about the safety he said since I was ""holding my own"" at these levels I was fine. The new doctor treated me like I had been solely responsible for the high levels I had been given. With utter disdain and almost like a punishment ""weaned'' me over a 1month period which set off the worst year of my life. 
Mind you I foolishly decided earlier to drop my antidepressant myself and went into very similar withdrawals. I couldn't function because my heart was at 150 BPM for days. Very similar to benzo withdrawal- chills, digestive issues and massive anxiety. 

Long term I never did recover. By year 2 I decided I would rather be taking lose dose for as long as needed rather than spend another year trapped inside my house. I couldn't do things that would have helped like exercise because I felt like fainting. Huge social anxiety. I had none of these issues prior to the rapid weaning. I still live with the constant tinnitus that never went away"
depression,euwyc86,t1_euo17lj,1564081042.0,"Sorry for the delay in replying. Had to go through a root canal repair so was in a lot of pain. 
I've pretty much exhausted my efforts to engage with my newish partner. He made a convincing attempt to let on he enjoyed the outdoors, hiking and listening to music and change conversation...at first. As time went by he has zero interest in sharing experiences with me. Simply sits and stares at his cell phone when he isn't at work. 
By loaning all my savings to him, having to let him use my vehicle for work Ive lost all my independence I used to enjoy. We live in a rural area with no buses so I've been stuck on this property for 8 long years. The slow climb out of his debts runs in cycles. As soon as we're clear he goes out and gets another loan. I severely misjudged on this person who has no idea how to manage money. Many winters we went without heat and had to rely on the food bank as a result of his poor management of money
Some would say to give up my dogs. 3 have passed away from old age as it is but Great Danes have been my passion for 20 years and I can't imagine being without the companionship especially now it's just me alone. We live in a bit of a pretend relationship. I did not know he had problems with impotence either so it truly has been isolating after being used to a loving relationship with my husband. I find myself trapped financially now as I've lived on a small disability income for 25 years. I used to manage fine in my previous home but my husband wasn't a fool with money and life wasnt burdened with hardships. Having a vehicle was something I took forever granted and I was out everyday doing all sorts of activities. 
What's happened is I've hoped each year, this will be the year he can buy his own vehicle for work. This will be the year I can get back to my life and build my pack back up and do more for the rescue I volunteer for. Despite my efforts to curtail loans and spending it doesn't happen as you can't control another. I've sunk into a bad cycle of insomnia .. up til 6am, sleep past noon.  Just a bad cycle that's self destructive. To know these are self destructive and still not be able to force change makes me feel so useless. 
I don't know. I wish access to better medical care were possible. To be referred to someone who might adjust my medication and talk therapy would be the only thing I can see that may help. A hard thing to achieve in a doctor shortage. I can't even find a listing for a psychiatrist in my area. My experience with psychologists was so futile. Told to cut out pictures from magazines that illicit emotion just didn't do anything for me. 1 visit every 2 months is pointless too.

Locked into a house with a person I now know had no intention of connecting on any real level. Just a fake sort of relationship. Plus he brought mountains of hidden debt (which only some of the money he borrowed never paid off). Living poor with no tangible escape anytime soon. The tension of faking a civil relationship to survive (and care for my Great Danes)....makes it too easy to pine for better days. Someone too lace fingers with and talk without words. I didn't know all the secret things this other man did to throw a hammer in hopes to reconcile with my husband until it was too late. 
I feel so stupid. Making big decisions while my dad had just died of cancer and my husband was going through his midlife crisis. Waiting out until I can recoup the 60 grand I'm owed that I need to start over. Why I ever trusted anyone with so much money is beyond me but it ruined me

I let time slip away on having children then found it was too late. I'm past 50 now and not in any position to adopt either so the thought of all I missed out on being a mother. The years ahead just stretch out with such emptiness. 
Thing is I used to be very involved in animal rescue and specifically Great Danes. In the small town I used to share a home with my husband I had friends and a life. In all the upheaval and pain I stupidly let him keep the home  I also let myself be taken advantage of financially by another man and got locked into buying another home together. I put up a the money (from the death of my dad I had an inheritance) and it was only supposed to be temporary. This guy was supposed to renovate it so I could sell it as a way to repay all the money he borrowed. I've been stuck here far away from friends for 8 years.

My logic tells me it's just depression keeping in negative thoughts but I'm just not climbing out of it. It's so easy to feel like a fool to let one major hurt control me. I've lost both parents which was gutting yet losing the love of my life has taken my spirit. I know I need to move on but can't.

I was prescribed Remeron and Clonazepam for 15 years as a chronic pain patient.. not for any depression or anxiety. When my family doctor retired a new rather arrogant doctor to his place and insisted on weaning me off both over a month and a half. 

It's been the most destructive thing I have experienced. Extreme social anxiety, general anxiety and total exercise intolerance set in and never went away for a year and a half. Now I've found a doctor willing to put me back on low doses of each but I'm still struggling with anxiety and depression I never had before. I'm overcome with dread leaving my home. I was never ever like this before. My health has suffered greatly from lack of even being able to walk more than 20min at a time. I used to be athletic and had to be to deal with chronic back pain from a bad accident that required major surgery. 

The shortsighted and ignorant approach of some doctors is very destructive and can have long reaching side affects. All I can say is if you don't feel these drugs make a real improvement in your life...don't ever go on them but for a brief time or at all. I believe they change your brains chemical balance in a way that isn't solved quickly. Mine still isn't healed and at this point, late in life I rather remain on low doses then continue to suffer the way I did for so long. All because they were supposed to help with sleep thus pain.

You aren't alone in feeling this way you feel is all I can say.

I wont lie. It never gets easier. You mourn and miss like it was yesterday. It cost me a lot. Never had the courage to have a child. Didnt have that person there to say ""I know you're afraid but its worth it"". Try not to carry the worst and hold onto the best memories. I regret so many things I didt do in the decade I spent mourning too heavily. Holding onto the things that you feel you cant do without her only wastes the time you have on this planet.

That changed the direction my life was headed which previously was nowhere. Found joy and fulfillment that didn't hinge on my husband having to be there to keep me company.

I really found it was the missing link between antidepressants and anxiety meds. I need less medication with this and it really improves sleep too. Acts as a mood stabilizer and helps with those lows in depression  without any hang over feeling.

I'm hoping what is available once I get my prescription will be better. I find it hard tell tell what strains are good for what. Few websites go into much description for someone whose been out of touch with the weed world. 

I'd be happy if it helped my daily headaches. Back pain tightens and creeps up the spine and grips like claws into my skull. Think any pain is easier to manage without daily headaches keeping you less able to get out and move. So any suggestions are greatly appreciated (if that's allowed). Their are subs but they are strictly non thc reviews. No one seems to want to speak about it"

Someone always has a friend that swears ""this or that"" will work miracles.

Maybe it's the idea of having no medical options for help anymore but I'm disheartened at chasing elusive pain relief in order to move and get out of bed each day. The money spent on alternatives !!! I'm sure many feel the same. Where even 5 years ago I at least could get a decent prescription (as long as I didn't ask too often). Enough to keep my mobility up and pain level down. That was my key. Help with the worst times to keep me moving. 
Since that ended each year I'm less and less fit despite my efforts to fight against pain. This elusive chasing the next natural remedy pain remedy. Spending 1/2 my weekly food budget to try kratom only to say ""I think maybe I can feel it "". That's a pricey maybe. I finally was exposed to someone selling dilaudid and it confirmed why I never bothered going that route. Choice of keeping a roof over my head or having a short supply of drugs is no choice at all. 

So I too find myself waiting for a delayed shipment for 4 days with half a dose left. It gets me by is the best I can say with a smattering of tylenol 1s. Sad. That's what happens when chiuxe is ripped away from the chronic pain patient.

If you were processing a lot of poppies, then you would risk simmering down large amounts of rinsed liquid to manageable amounts. That's done with caution.

You cant seem to just tell how you feel. Apparently you must act unstable or something I dont know. I do know its dehumanizing and so harmful to your health to be going on and off medications like that. You would think a doctor would know this too. I hate living with the fear of not getting my medications that I've been on for 12 years and being dependent on the whim of each new ER doctor I see.

To keep it brief, being human he hurt me so deeply I turned away and withdrew. Now I'm trapped inside a situation where I'm so constrained and would do anyway to turn back time. 
Only message I can share is it's better to let yourself be vulnerable and exposed to experience the best out of life. Put yourself out there while you can.

First thing he said was this is too high a dose and reduced it. 
The medical community are the worst offenders that make a mockery of ""mental health awareness"". They seem more apt to roll the eyes and pass judgment. The ironic bit is I'm on a long term disability pension and these drugs were approved to be covered as part of my chronic pain treatment plan. To help with sleep thus aid in healing I was told. 
Sure wish I had known my doctor was about to retire so I could have set up a year of refills and asked him to make a note on my file. This seeing a different doctor every time to be told it was fine/ no problem to refill, next time...no I dont feel comfortable filling this"
AnxietyDepression,eqo8oee,t3_byyd24,1560185557.0,"Man I hope you can get back on them soon. It can be a nightmare and dangerous going off antidepressants.

He either was ignorant or didn't care when he refused to see me anymore as a patient after taking me off medication my old doctor had me on for 15 years 
It was a whole year of hell for me. Felt like daily I waa living a panic attack, a sustained one. I couldnt go outside, month a of not sleeping but for tiny snippets here and there. I lost 60lbs from running on pure anxiety all that time. Because theres q critical shortage of doctors I still dont have one yet and getting help is off and on going to clinics. Since you never see the same doctor 
Only thanks to the kindness of my husbands doctor I've been back on them and feel so much better. Like my old self again. My greatest fear though, he says he cant keep doing it since he cant take me on as a patient so cant keep phoning in my prescriptions much longer

For some, these meds are a necessity for life like myself. God knows a year was more than a fair shake at trying to live and cope with my anxiety on my own and it didnt work. So sick of hearing a new doctor say it's not healthy to stay on them. My old doctor (now retired) assured me that since I never asked for increasing doses I was fine to stay on them as long as they helped. Clearly I'm not fine off them. I grew so sickly and in such poor physical condition, it's far more unhealthy being off them and not being able to even go for walks. I lost an entire year tied to my house. 

Dearly hope you get the meds you need.  I must look up the one you're taking since they really hate giving me the tranquilizer ive been on 15 years. I'm so sick of being treated like a druggy by a slew of young residents who have no idea of my  treatment over 10 years.

Mine is a shitty case. 30 years ago after my accident I was sent to several specialists. CT scan done (but never looked at). It showed I needed surgery immediately. I went through months of physio, only to get worse of course so I was labeled a drug seeker. Even once I lost the use of legs, bladder and bowel...I was put into the mental ward of my local hospital. It took one doctor who knew how hard I worked in physio to pull me out and get me to another city for emergency surgery 
Fast forward to 3 years ago. My old doctor retired and a young one took over. I develop a severe bladder infection so went in and gave a urine sample. When I showed up for my appointment I was told my health card expired and to fill out the renewal form and never gave it a second thought (they expire every 5 years on your birthday)...it wasnt my birthday nor at the 5 year mark but I was in distress with my bladder. A week later he called me back to see him. Then proceeded to berate me for testing positive for 4 different prescription pain meds and dismissed me as a patient. I tried to insist he test me again but he refused to believe me. I've had no way to fight this without a doctor to retest me because there was zero chance I had these things in my urine. As it is I live on a small disability pension, own my own home and run a small animal rescue so I couldnt think of spending money I dont have to get all these drugs. Surely wouldnt risk it after the nightmare I was put through just to get the surgery needed
The only thing I can think is they mixed up samples with someone whose health card needed renewal. Mine was fine for another 4 years but end result...any slim hope I had of being treated for my chronic pain was destroyed and not likely to get another doctor anytime soon. 

It angers me so since you dont get a chronic pain disability pension without extensive tests by government funded doctors. It's not a scam, I live in pain constantly due to the delay in my intial treatment. This opiate hysteria has gotten so out of control. This last brush with a doctor has changed my life drastically. Just getting non pain medication has become an ordeal. Suffered depression as a result and have to explain and haggle with each new ER doctor when my script runs out.

She must have felt so helpless not knowing what to do but she sure wanted me to know I wasnt alone. Left bruised and battered and definitely not alone in my own head. My father once hollered at me ""dont you know how much we love you?"" It isnt easy but its better to not isolate yourself when you have loving parents.

As a mid 50s woman I would say most parents who love their kids prefer they come to them whatever the problem. They always want the best for you even if it means going through the rough times as well. It kills me when it's so clear that some parents aren't that committed or invested.

I went through a serious bout of depression 30 years ago and was forced to participate in a ""day hospital"" program of group sessions. Luckily it helped despite the arrogant staff. It wasn't so much them but the new people I met and made friends with. Surprising the new friends you can make during breaks for lunch who feel the same as you do (this place is a crock of shit). The stuff they were preaching may have been useless like ""it doesnt matter why you're depressed so forget that"". It very much mattered to most of us and we were able to talk to each about the things that brought us down and it helped so much and only then were we able to move on and do other things more enjoyable. The mental health system here sucks and to ignore that people were dealing with marital splits, custody battles, past sexual abuse....that's insane. Getting together with people and talking engaged your mind again too

I am very much an introvert and yet in my worst hours forced to be with people from all walks of life also struggling....I didnt feel so alone. That helped this numb brain affect 

Now i don't even have access to this kind of program as health care is even worse in my area now. Now in my 50's I'm struggling once again with depression and alone. Huge difference. I'm dull and only hope I come out of it enough to engage with others again. That's when the mind lifts from that fog. It's not easy especially when it's not people going through similar things. You feel more comfortable around people dealing with the same dull fog you are. Easier not to feel so stupid and no need to explain like with people who aren't depressed. But it's worth exploring the idea to find something to engage in that involves others dealing with depression. Not for a moan fest but to dust of the old grey matter. Trust me, as much as I didnt want to join in I'm glad I had that option back 30 years ago. With no available doctors and an overtaxed mental health system here, these programs have dried up...unless you're dealing with addiction.  Still loads of support for this segment of the population and hard not to resent it (as mean as that sounds). All I would have to do as lie and say I'm addicted to something and I would be in treatment right away. Been over a year dealing alone with zero support and withholding medications that could help me because I don't have a family doctor to oversee my care

After 24 years of trust built and being able to tell my family doctor just about anything.....now I have this feeling like I've lost something like a parent (for lack of any better way to describe it).  I briefly saw his replacement who took one look at the 2 prescriptions my old doctor had me on for 12 years (for depression/anxiety) and immediately started reducing doses. He did so so fast he had me off them in 1 month and sent me into massive protracted withdrawals. I became a nervous wreck for over a year and refused to help me. It got so bad he dismissed me as a patient so I then was without any doctor for 3 years. 
Try getting help from an out patient department or walk in clinic under these circumstances!! Going 12 years of being well with no serious issues and a kind doctor not being able to leave me home or even work or do any physical activity without passing out...I was that sick. 
Long story short, I now see how important being able to talk openly and trust a doctor is. They must also show us some trust and respect as a patient. I've been treated no better than a drug seeker for simply needing to remain on medication that kept me well for many years (without abusing them)

Thank god my husbands doctor finally decided to put me back on them a month ago. It's the best i have felt in over a year, I cant begin to describe how much better I feel. Yes it is the meds but also having 1 doctor decide to care brings such comfort. That's it in a nutshell. Having a doctor care about your wellbeing is a huge comfort when you are vulnerable. Not dismissive or judgemental. That care is a huge part of helping people especially when they are in a vulnerable state"
depression,eojalmt,t3_bs232a,1558635272.0,It infuriates me to see how cruelly people are treated just mentioning suicide. I myself have seen the cold glaze come over a doctors face when I said I sometimes felt that way when I was young. A girl in a neighboring city was turned away from a hospital after an attempt. Despite her parents begging for support. Why the mental health community are so ignorant and cruel regarding suicide is beyond me
