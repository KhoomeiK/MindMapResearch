Yes, a therapist will tell you because there is years worth of research to back up what they are saying as well as the 10+ years they have studied this. You talk about the last line of my first comment because I don't understand how bad a bad lsd trip can be and that a bad lsd trip is WORSE than a bad MDMA roll (based on your opinion, not facts which is ironic) validates my point if your opinion is correct since I have had a bad roll on MDMA and was manic for a week. OP had PTSD for 6 months and was probably manic due to it with him saying ""I'm kinda scared it **may actually be related to my sickness**"". 

 The only thing you've got me on is not putting in brackets (if it swings to a bad roll like before) but that's all.

Once again, stop presuming shit. I have zero tactics whatsoever, I am just saying what any psychiatrist would be saying. **It is more scary that you are sitting there trying to say ""yeah but"" about the psychiatrist,  especially when it is known by everyone how fundamental it is to have one when you have Bipolar Disorder.**

bipolar,fe6yv28,t3_enzn70,1578907819.0,"This is just from my POV, it can vary from person to person. Bipolar Disorder is very diverse and that's what shitty and great about it because you will get so many different stories. But here are some core tips that helped me:

\- Medication can take time for your dr to find the perfect combo for you and there is a chance you will experience side effects (which can make your MH worse).

\- Therapy depends on what you have went through as a person so I dont wanna comment on that besides be 100% honest and stick it. Once you find a therapist that you can connect with, it is an incredible thing.

\- Dealing/Living with the diagnosis is the hardest part in my own opinion. Being self aware to know that a lot of my problems in my life were a result of me being reckless (hence the username) really fucked with my head (you'll see why soon) but it helped me grow into the person I am today. Taking accountability and being honest about your feelings before you lose your shit is a must, OP. Not everything can be blamed on the Bipolar.

\- Hold onto your support system HARD. you need them. If you don't have anyone, we will be your support system. You can talk to anyone here.

\- Learn your condition

>Identify triggers that can lead to serious mood changes or episodes (people, surroundings, smells).  
>  
>Figure out the physical and mental symptoms your body gives you to say 'sup, going into an episode'. For me, I noticed (like a few months after diagnosis) that when I was going into any episode  my vision would start to focus out even with my glasses, my heart rate goes through the roof and I obsessively fixate on stupid shit/things I generally wouldn't care about.  
>  
>Also identify the 'cycle' you go through when you have an episode (before, during and after) so you are prepared for what's coming and can handle it as best as possible.

\*pls don't read the next part if you are easily triggered with some suicide talk\*

My personal take on the condition:

Even with a diagnosis like Bipolar, it honestly changed my life for the better. Taking accountability and being honest with myself pushed me to go do uni (after dropping out in yr 11), lose over 40kgs (100lbs+) and helped me see toxic behaviour from not only myself but from other people close to me that I had to cut off.

Downside: I remember when I was originally diagnosed @ 19, I thought meds was going to 'fix' my Bipolar. I was so so so wrong. I think of my Bipolar (+ other MH issues) as a feral lion in a small cage - unlocked that I need to hold shut. The meds were the key to locking the door but it doesn't stop the lion from being the disgusting, savage that he is and doing as much damage as it can by attacking me through the bars or breaking the door all together and mangling me. OP, I walk day to day wanting to physically die everyday due to how hard it is. Not to the point where I have suicidal thoughts 100% of the time, going to push the blade in wrist or od on pills etc (thank fucking god) but to a point where I just don't want to live -at fucking all. However, I could never EVER hurt my husband (my support system) again (abused him really bad prior to diagnosis - self awareness was my enemy). I am a pretty high functioning person with Bipolar disorder because I made myself do everything that I didn't want to do and fighting till my last breath. I have put many people I love through torture for years while I was undiagnosed (as well as being a shit cunt back then) and me succeeding in life the best and healthiest way I can is the ONLY way I can show them how fucking sorry I am and prove to them that you can be a good person with a dark cloud constantly over their head.

I will always hold onto that cage door - fighting to be the best version of myself. I will do that until I die.

&#x200B;

OP, work on yourself, even if every cell in your body screams to give up.

bipolar,fe6psjs,t1_fe6oext,1578899754.0,"I mean, the OP has started name calling me (delusional, selfish, narcissistic, egotistical + more) because I was calling her out on her incorrect facts, the ‚Äúpeople w BP are selfish to have kids because [insert incorrect facts]‚Äù narrative she is pushing, the deflecting when called out and manipulating other commenters words against them. Like hell, she told me that my BP was mild since I am handling my condition well - who the fuck does that?

It really is sad that there are people out there that ask questions then start attacking people who answer."
bipolar,fe6ilda,t1_fe6ib7j,1578892052.0,"I mean, if that‚Äôs all you have, please use it. I‚Äôm a reckless cunt - wow. Accountability is actually a positive thing for people with Bipolar. Lol. Maybe that‚Äôs why OP kept deflecting. Self growth can start today üëèüèª"
bipolar,fe6i0oy,t1_fe6h0tf,1578891522.0,"Damn, gotta give up something I am great at because 2 people on the internet think I‚Äôm ‚Äòunethical‚Äô. 

Try again."
bipolar,fe6hxf9,t1_fe6fe6c,1578891439.0,You can call me any name under the sun (I‚Äôm stable enough to get called anything without getting triggered - you‚Äôre very lucky with the names you‚Äôve called me on this thread.) but are you really going to comment with name calling without responding to the correct facts?
bipolar,fe6gvr3,t1_fe6gqci,1578890517.0,And now you‚Äôve broken rule #5 of this subreddit.
bipolar,fe6gppy,t1_fe6g9s4,1578890373.0,I think assuming things like OP does would be a good time to check my professional ethics.
bipolar,fe6gka2,t1_fe6g918,1578890243.0,"‚ÄúIs anyone else childless due to the [false fact]?‚Äù 
I answered with a sensible answer you call me super selfish (showing your personal feelings about BP people having kids) and have been deflecting, manipulating my words and calling me names that I am not as well as judging my future line of work - when you know nothing about me. You have a long way to go with accountability and common sense, I‚Äôm not responding back to you on this thread - just on the ones where people have posted the proof that discredits your original question."
bipolar,fe6g3yy,t1_fe6fz5t,1578889855.0,"Notice how you attacked a random redditor over having a different opinion to you when the facts of ‚Äú90%‚Äù is a lie. You attacked someone over false info, come back with common sense pls. Deflecting doesn‚Äôt look cute hahah"
bipolar,fe6fs8h,t1_fe6fbw2,1578889577.0,"I mean at the end of the day, you‚Äôre the clown projecting a narrative that BP people will have BP kids when the correct stats posted in the comments (that you‚Äôve chosen to ignore) - showing that the chances of having a child with Bipolar is at least half of what you‚Äôve said."
bipolar,fe6f6rk,t1_fe6ey3x,1578889084.0,"Narrative; Bipolar people shouldn‚Äôt have kids and people who have them are ‚ÄúSUPER SELFISH‚Äù 

That‚Äôs the part that makes you sad not your decision to have a child. All you‚Äôre doing is proving my point."
bipolar,fe6f2pw,t1_fe6erg5,1578888992.0,"I mean, the comment is there for everyone to see. What you can take out of this is to learn and be accepting of other people‚Äôs opinions - even if yours is based on facts and theirs has been a decision they‚Äôve though about for years."
bipolar,fe6ew33,t1_fe6epnm,1578888838.0,"I mean, I would rethink your whole view on life if I were you but hey, I‚Äôm not a sad person projecting their narrative."
bipolar,fe6ep63,t1_fe6e7nw,1578888681.0,All you‚Äôve done is that you‚Äôre manipulating my words. Maybe your therapist needs to take some notes because I haven‚Äôt even met you and have picked out some nasty habits you can fix as a person.
bipolar,fe6em41,t1_fe6ebr2,1578888612.0,You asked a question and I answered with an answer you didn‚Äôt like so you accused me of being super selfish. You also aren‚Äôt in the position to tell another person where they can post.
bipolar,fe6efip,t1_fe6e4fn,1578888465.0,"If you don‚Äôt want to risk that, that‚Äôs your choice. I never ever judged you on that. You‚Äôre the one judging another person on their decision to have a child with their nonBPSO on false information. I also didnt say you were unstable but, when I was shoving agendas like you, I was low key projecting some inner demons hence why I said maybe. 

But clearly, you‚Äôre just an asshole manipulating my words. Come back with valid criticism - bye üëã"
bipolar,fe6e6fk,t1_fe6arbu,1578888262.0,"This doesn‚Äôt fit OP‚Äôs narrative, man. They called me super selfish because I‚Äôm eventually going to have kids when little to their knowledge, these are the facts."
bipolar,fe6dza9,t1_fe6ddil,1578888106.0,"The chance of getting Bipolar disorder when one of your parents has it is not 90%, it‚Äôs not even 50% and Bipolar Disorder can also be managed. 

You also say that child free people are allowed to exist while judging parents w Bipolar having biological kids even though 9/10, they turn out completely fine. Why can‚Äôt I judge you on your decisions  when you judge me  for mine? Hypocrite.

If I want to give my husband a biological child & that shit gene hits, I will deal with it. Bipolar is not a life sentence and by the time I have kids, I will be a clinical psychologist so I think I‚Äôll be in a good position to make  a decision like that without some random (maybe unstable) redditor telling me I‚Äôm a bad person.

Edit: & I don‚Äôt want to adopt, the perks of free choice."
bipolar,fe6d2o6,t1_fe6anwk,1578887385.0,"Well why don‚Äôt you tell that to every parent or parent to be that decides to have children when they are predisposed to non-fatal genetic illnesses or conditions? 

And let‚Äôs be real here mate, 90% is a massive overstretch but I guess it‚Äôs needed for the narrative you have: Bipolar people shouldn‚Äôt have kids since kids will have it so people who decide to have them are selfish cunts. 

I don‚Äôt see the point in pushing an agenda on Reddit but you don‚Äôt see me pointing that out, do ya?"
bipolar,fe69f03,t3_enxm7t,1578884708.0,"I used to be like that but now I know what is needed for a person with a diagnosis like this. If my child had this, I would have a fuck ton of guilt but I would make sure that they get the best help humanely possible. 

I would make sure they have the options I wasn‚Äôt given.

Edit: come read OP‚Äôs ‚Äòlogic‚Äô as she deflects, manipulates my words and calls me names because I don‚Äôt believe that Bipolar Disorder shouldn‚Äôt be a means to stop you from having kids when the info she spat out was incorrect."

bipolar,fe00sen,t3_en8455,1578800307.0,This is the reason why I am glad that I don‚Äôt have 100% control over my money. I would end up doing shit like this and my poor ass can‚Äôt end up in debt :‚Äô)
