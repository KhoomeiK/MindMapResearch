I wfh in the morning and he wfh in the afternoon so we trade off with our 5 year old. He is engaged with our son in the morning, but he struggles to do that AND do chores. And when I bring it up he says ""I was with kiddo all morning"" and I'm like yes, and I was working not lounging around, and now I will be with kiddo all afternoon and will now have to do ALL the chores instead of half of them. Now he does dishes in the morning but I hate that for each and every chore I have to tell him to do it, he argues that he shouldn't have to do it, I have to explain to him that that makes no sense, and THEN he'll do it. How about you have some kind of internal desire to not live in a garbage dump?

I have gotten to the point where I want a divorce over his lack of partnership at times. He finally got medicated for ADHD after years of me asking him to talk to his doctor about his symptoms so that has been a big improvement but we have ebbs and flows of problems with this. If we get divorced this will be the main reason."

Not saying that those things are always unnecessary. I definitely had a broken sense of what I needed when I was being impulsive with my refund, and I see that same thing with my family. I still have to check myself to make sure that when I feel like I need something I really do need it (or that it's worth it to buy and not just an impulse)."

I had my son before I was diagnosed and I'm so worried he's going to have it. Hopefully since we're aware of the risk and are keeping an eye on him if he does we can get him help early.

I have had some successes over time but never did anything quite right. I always feel like I'm a kid playing dress up or something, trying to do what humans do but I'm not quite on the right path. I graduated college in my late 20s but didn't get a particularly useful degree or make any connections during college, I just saw that a college degree was expected and didn't have any guidance about how to do it right. I'm literally just within this year learning how to manage my money. I grew up in poverty so my parents couldn't teach me about money management, but I think it's crazy I didn't really learn how to look beyind each paycheck for so long.

I just got a job that I like where I earn a decent wage but I'm struggling so hard to work full time. I have a 5 year old and I feel like I don't see him enough, don't have any time to myself, and don't have time to do chores and errands. I want to quit and stay in bed all day. I am working with my psychiatrist to get my meds right, I think we've got a decent handle on my anxiety, and I haven't been manic since I started taking lamictal, but I'm depressed and it makes it really hard to function. I don't think it's this hard for the average person.

I like my job but there is so much to get done, so few hours that I'm not at work, and so little time to spend with my son. I hope it will get easier. I don't think hiring a cleaning service would really help because what's really tiring are the daily chores and tasks that feel so overwhelming after working all day.  I had to call in sick twice in my second week because my son was sick and that was so stressful. It's just so hard to juggle everything.

Tension in your jaw can cause tension in the rest of your body), and pulling as hard as I could. It finally popped out. My cervix really hurt for days.

femalefashionadvice,f7bihk1,t3_dutank,1573569770.0,"I like thrift shopping if the store organizes clothing by size. Savers is my favorite (and I just moved to a place with Savers after not being near one for a long time!) because it is well organized and fairly priced. Goodwill is well organized but the prices are too high for a thrift shop IMO so I don't go there often and am choosy. Stores that don't organize by size are very overwhelming for me and definitely not worth it. It also varies store to store, some are just not well stocked whereas others have tons of great things.

It also is a wildly different experience depending on your size. I've been a size 20 all the way down to currently a 6/8 and only now do I find it fun. There are lots of options for me now, before it was hit or miss. I should also note that I wear a lot of basics in more neutral colors so that helps too. But when I was bigger and even as I got smaller (where I relied on thrift stores to afford replacing my wardrobe every few months as I shrunk out of my clothes) it was not easy to find things in my size. I don't buy things that need to be tailored, I'd rather just buy new in that case. I don't buy clothes that look dirty or stained. 

Thrift stores have also been a lifesaver for clothes for my son. He is hard on clothes (blows out all the knees in his pants) and obviously grows quickly so needs new clothes often. Most of his clothes are thrifted, some are consigned, very few are brand new."
BipolarReddit,f4uaifp,t1_f4rpk4j,1571803697.0,"This is why it took me so long to consider bipolar and bring it up with a doctor. My dad has BP1 and has always described his mania as euphoric and I have never felt that way. I had a more obvious episode last winter--I was suddenly going to apply to grad school and was emailing old professors and telling all my friends and not sleeping because I was researching schools and reading a GRE prep book. There was no way I would have been able to get all the requirements done by the deadline, and I had been working hard on my business so this grad school idea made no sense. Anyway, it did not feel good, I was really anxious and emailing my professors felt awful but I couldn't stop. About a week later I crashed into a suicidal depression. I'm still skeptical about my diagnosis even though I can see more symptoms over the years now that I know what I'm looking for and lamictal has helped a ton (but I still struggle a lot). It's hard for me to differentiate between anxiety, sensory overload, and hypomania. My pdoc wasn't great but I just moved so hopefully the new one I find will be better and can help me."

He is not a typical boy. I see plenty of boys who can walk through a store without running, jumping, grabbing everything in sight. Some kids are calm, some are crazy, it has nothing to do with sex.

It's so amazing to not have to wait days and days for the terro to work like we used to do when they would eat it.
