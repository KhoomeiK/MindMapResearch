weightlifting,fqz7jns,t3_glos5j,1589761519.0,"Do you have a video of your squat? Your only going to go as deep as you can back squat. Are your feet nornally in that stance (where you caught the barbell) when you squat. If it is its strictly mobility. Mobility will come just keep striving for the perfect bottom position. Just keep doing the movement. Stretching is great but dont spend too much time on it, unless a specific muscle is tight"

weightlifting,fpfbii2,t3_gct6x7,1588566539.0,"Looks like your hip is rotating to the left side of your body. Notice how your left leg is nice and open, but your right leg internally rotates and caves a bit. What happens a lot of times when people go heavy is that the bar doesnt go as high so as people compensate by leaning foward or widening the feet to catch it lower. To me it looks like you have some tightness in the hips or ankles that prevent you from catching it in a deep squat. So as a result you have to lower youe torso which is shifting your center of gravity forwards"
