Crushes,f11oimb,t3_d7kmwt,1569128348.0,Imma be 100 with u u just overthinking it. I might be wrong but the way u described it he clearly is interested in u
Crushes,f11o30s,t3_d7ktoc,1569128174.0,i mean its weird but u do u. And tbh if someone has social media and his/her acount is public that means they dont care if u see it. Just dont let them know u know everything about them cuz its gonna get rly weird
Crushes,f11npqr,t3_d7lk4o,1569128026.0,i would like to tell u that when you have a crush on someone u overthink a lot about him things might be obvious but u dont realise it. And usually when a boy flirts with a girl he tries to be with her a lot  and is nicer than usual with her.

Crushes,eymqics,t3_cxq51d,1567216839.0,"Hey man i would suggest to not rush anything dont ask her out to soon get to know her the easiest way would be to do some school work with her like a project or something. And people usually act weird in front of crushes cuz they're shy so try getting comfortable with her and once u get to know her ur gonna get less awkward and u will be able to talk about everything. 
Good luckk"
