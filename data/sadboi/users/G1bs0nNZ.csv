UpliftingNews,fo9on9c,t1_fo9oh6r,1587625891.0,Well ideally we maintain our border security if we successfully eradicate the virus from the local population.

I'm basically doing it to continue to provide the simple hosting, but by using virtual machines, try to reduce the risk of the vulnerabilities affecting my websites for other clients. I'm not selling it as a VPS service as such. None of the sites I host record user data, the only reason a database is used is to enable the client to use the content management system backend.

The questions are from two previously validated tools. Of course there will always be some difference in interpretation, but that's also where the interviews are also important, to dig deeper into the data."

The difference is that I wouldn't have ethical approval around a study... but then I wouldn't be publishing the results. If you remind me in a day or two lol, I can find out."
religion,ez8mdo1,t1_ez89c8b,1567748638.0,"Would have to check with her and her supervisor re: publishing, but I'm sure it would be of interest. Will try see if it can be reproduced. It will also include interviews as well which will give really useful data.

Basically the challenge at present is just around getting enough New Zealanders to fill it out (it's a shame we can't look internationally at present, but the local context is important first)."
Christian,ez8mb8r,t1_ez4uwae,1567748559.0,"Precisely. So in addition to the survey there will be interviews too. It would be interesting to see the divide between sex positive and sex negative Christianity and why it exists / what it means for a therapeutic context.

I know I'm not an expert, and thus shouldn't be thinking I could necessarily track them down, but I am covered in these red spots, I would have thought there would be at least some reasonable sign of infestation given the amount."
