Sonographers,fpojyid,t1_fpofoo4,1588785769.0,"I‚Äôm just wrapping up my prerequisites. I graduated high school in 2005 and had no idea what I wanted to do. Long story short I was enrolled in and out of universities and community colleges from 2005-2011. I tried full time initially but dropped out because of a boy (dumb). Then moved away from home and had to work full time so I tried part time but at that point in my life I still couldn‚Äôt make school my priority...my boyfriend (now ex) was priority (dumb). I gave up on school after 2011 because that‚Äôs when I started to work in management and work my way up in animal care jobs. I thought that was my calling and had dreams of eventually opening my own facility. 15 years into this industry though and I am incredibly burnt out on the high turn over which causes me to work ungodly hours and all holidays, burnt out on high maintenance clients with unreasonable expectations because they don‚Äôt understand dog behavior or basic veterinary medical science, and business owners who take shortcuts on safety for staff and dogs, as well as severely underpay staff to make themselves more money. 

Last year I made up my mind that I was going to enroll in classes and pursue my degree...I chose sonography because it seems like an area that would have fairly stable job security and I like the idea of doing something thats actually making a difference for people instead of offering a luxury niche service. 

So here I am! If I stay with my current school I‚Äôll be able to apply to the sonography program next spring. If I transfer I‚Äôm not sure what my timeline will look like but it‚Äôs incredibly satisfying to finally be a successful student after years of stumbling and having no real direction for my education."

Because of covid I may actually have to relocate two hours way from my school so I‚Äôm looking into other imaging programs like CT scan technology, MRI tech, and mammography that are offered in the area we may be relocating to.

I‚Äôm unemployed because if the pandemic - I chose not to return to my toxic job that insisted on reopening nearly 3 weeks before the Ohio stay at home order was lifted. It was incredibly bad for my mental health anyway and I had no faith that my boss would truly take precautions to keep us safe.

parrots,fpiaqlb,t1_fpi98ux,1588637068.0,"The vet didn‚Äôt give any guidance for weight gain other than switch her to pellets, increase veggies, and minimize fruits and protein. After the fluids she was given I did notice her perk up a bit and return almost to her normal activity level. At that time she was still perching and had full use of her feet. She‚Äôs definitely got an appetite (eating as I type this) and she‚Äôs still drinking, preening, she contact calls for me but she‚Äôs no longer as vocal as she once was....she can climb and walk, but now she can‚Äôt perch because her toes don‚Äôt curl. It‚Äôs like they‚Äôre paralyzed. 

It‚Äôs been about three weeks since we saw the vet, whose only real prognosis was ‚Äúsupportive care.‚Äù I‚Äôm a bit disappointed as i expected more from an avian vet who is one of the more recommended avian practices in my area. She even sounded like she was insinuating I had neglected her because she goes, ‚Äúshe‚Äôs extremely underweight and this didn‚Äôt just happen overnight.‚Äù I felt like a murderer! We all know birds hide illness until they are very sick and if I was neglecting her why would I bother even taking her to a vet? 

The other avian vets in my area are the university and emergency hospitals. I‚Äôm unemployed due to covid so it‚Äôs just like....the timing is awful. Not that I ever want to deal with a sick animal, but especially not when finances are so tight. I applied for CareCredit but was declined and the emergency clinics/university don‚Äôt offer payment plans. Her initial visit and lab work was about $400 alone...and this is where we‚Äôre at. 

This whole situation just sucks. Thank you for being kind. It‚Äôs not something that often happens on the Internet when it comes to situations like this."
parrots,fphzke4,t1_fphxjli,1588630756.0,"She was underweight when she went in (another thing I feel horrible about - I didn‚Äôt know she was...in photos I‚Äôve shared with people they said they wouldn‚Äôt have known either. I‚Äôm now weighing her daily) and she‚Äôs still underweight. Her white blood cell count was high as well so the vet prescribed enrofloxacin to address infection and they administered fluids. Vet was the one who informed me her diet was incorrect - she gave us a vitamin supplement to add to her food or water (I prefer adding it to her food because I feel like she‚Äôs getting it this way) and that‚Äôs where I purchased the Harrison‚Äôs high potency pellets. I‚Äôve also been giving her benebac probiotic and I‚Äôm seeing a noticeable difference in her stool (for the better - it‚Äôs less runny). 

I‚Äôm confused and not happy that nothing was prescribed to address the uric acid levels, but maybe that‚Äôs because my particular vet does not believe there is a safe med to use. I‚Äôm reading that Allopurinol is a commonly prescribed med to lower UA but it‚Äôs not without potential serious side effects, so meds and other xanthine oxidase inhibitors are very controversial in avian medicine. 

She‚Äôs getting celery seed and tart cherry juice, which are homeopathic methods of lowering UA levels so that‚Äôs what we‚Äôre going with. I have concerns about stress levels alone if we have to go to the vet possibly daily for fluid therapy...not to mention that‚Äôs simply not feasible with work. 

I‚Äôm just frustrated and sad...I hate seeing her like this. If there‚Äôs no hope in her recovering to be able to at least perch again I feel like I can‚Äôt offer her a true high quality of life but I don‚Äôt want to have to make that decision. :("

AskWomen,fn6nq7t,t3_fzilqv,1586703618.0,"So, I was a complete asshole to my fianc√© when we first met. We met on OKCupid and our first date was dinner and a show (Saves The Day). The very next morning we met up for coffee at a local market and a walk around a park. I should say local for me - he drove an hour to come back and see me. Initially I was like, wow this seems like a dream! We went to another show a week or so later. That‚Äôs when I started getting antsy.

I was a commitmentphobe after who I call my ‚Äúbig ex.‚Äù I chased people who were assholes and pushed away the good ones, I think because subconsciously I knew I wouldn‚Äôt get hurt the same way if I did that.

I started to feel weird and claustrophobic. We went to a local indie music festival together but I was an outright monster to him. I basically ignored him in favor of my friends, and later that night I got drunk and basically made out with a dude right in front of him.

After that night I started ignoring his texts. I was mad at myself for ‚Äúdoing the thing‚Äù because he was nice and he liked me. On paper it should be working.

A couple months later we started talking again and decided to hang out again. I had the same feelings initially but felt weird again when it started to become clear he was really into me and ghosted again. He never left my mind for some reason.

Fast forward a year or so later. We reconnect and start hanging out a bit again. This time I decide I‚Äôm going to be all in...and he ghosts on me. 

Hm. Okay.

We didn‚Äôt talk for a couple of years. I moved to another city and he ended up moving to my original city. Our lives went on but he would pop into my mind frequently. I ended up moving back and we connected on Tinder. Met up for an awkward dinner (the night I started getting sick with the flu but didn‚Äôt know it yet), but started hanging out more and more, especially because we were living in the same city for once.

Then he ghosted me after a couple of months. This time it hurt and this time I was significantly more angry. I sent him a long text about how much he hurt me and how I thought he was better than this. Blah blah blah. Yeah, I know it was karma for what I did. I get it. He didn‚Äôt reply. 

A month or so later he texted me out of the blue about how sorry he was, how wrong he was, and how he screwed up. I decided to hear him out so we met up and he spilled everything to me. I made it clear that I wasn‚Äôt going to keep doing this back and forth thing and this was our last shot to get it right.

I‚Äôm happy to say almost 3 years later we‚Äôre inseparable, engaged, and incredibly happy. Even though it wasn‚Äôt love at first sight, there was this odd naggy feeling that wouldn‚Äôt let me forget him. I can only describe it as weird.

careerguidance,fhjfdqx,t1_fhjewzu,1581644832.0,"I don‚Äôt know, my dude. I spent 7 years trying to pursue a degree while working because I made the shitty decision to prioritize relationships with toxic people instead of my future, lol. And I have zero to show for it except thousands of dollars of wasted money in debt. 

As much as I hate the bootstraps thing, at some point you have to just go for it. Things don‚Äôt always work out and that‚Äôs life. But you can‚Äôt let past experiences hold you back from making progress forever. Just be smart about any decisions you make and have faith that things will work out in the end. Fake confidence if you have to, but be confident. Employers will pick up on it and that alone goes a long way."
careerguidance,fhjdp97,t3_f3itgj,1581643639.0,"It‚Äôs tough. I‚Äôm 33 and doing it. I‚Äôve worked with dogs for the past 15 years and currently am the general manager of a busy premier franchise facility (the only reason why I make a comfortable salary and have health insurance/PTO). Despite running a nearly million dollar business, I feel like most employers don‚Äôt take my position seriously because they think we ‚Äújust play with dogs all day.‚Äù 

I enrolled back into college to pursue a sonography degree and get into the healthcare industry. It‚Äôs insanely difficult running a business and taking classes, but it‚Äôs really my only option to get out of my current industry and I‚Äôve resolved myself to it. I‚Äôm attending a technical college, so I‚Äôm hoping with everything that I have that the debt I‚Äôm accruing will be worth it in the end because hopefully I‚Äôll be able to land a job making $20k more a year than I‚Äôm currently making. I was previously a zoology major and had considered pursuing that dream.....but the difference between choosing a degree at 33 and choosing a degree at 18 is life experience. And bills. 

If you‚Äôre tech-y and dabble in computers, you could consider teaching yourself coding. My fianc√© is currently doing this and there are quite a few free or cheap (in comparison to college tuition) tools you can use online to help you get started. Companies will look at your portfolio instead of whether you have a degree. Check out the Odin Project or Eloquent JavaScript. This is stuff you can do in your free time and you‚Äôll get as much out of it as you put into it. 

It‚Äôs certainly not easy but it can be done. I‚Äôm saving as much as I possibly can in preparation of when I get accepted into a program so that I can quit and go full time with school. I know not everyone has the luxury of this option, but just sharing what I‚Äôm currently doing. 

Hang in there! It‚Äôs tough for our generation. It really is."

BorderCollie,fgskgn5,t1_fgsiej0,1581086583.0,"Awe, good luck to your buddy! The good news is neutering is usually easier on them than spaying unless he‚Äôs cryptorchid and they have to go internally. 

You‚Äôll want to keep him quiet for 7-10 days or so, which depending on your pup might be easier said than done. If he has a crate you may need to have him spend some extra time in there if you‚Äôre having trouble/not able to watch him directly. Frozen peanut butter Kongs or stuffed bones that will make him focus less on his incision are going to be invaluable in trying to keep him quiet!

This donut e-collar is gobs better than a traditional e-collar in my opinion. We picked this up for about $25 at a local pet store. She can move comfortably in it and eat and drink, isn‚Äôt stressed out by it, and it also inhibits her from reaching her incision (although I may be exchanging this for the next size up as she can almost reach it). Be sure to get it ahead of time so you can use it right away. 

Dogs are pretty resilient. My girl is noticeably quieter today but not incapacitated by any means like we might feel after an abdominal surgery. That said, ask for pain medication from your vet. Sometimes they won‚Äôt dispense it unless requested or people will decline seeing it as an added expense. But for the comfort of your pup, please get them something! We‚Äôre on carprofen for these first 3 days. 

Good luck! üíó"
