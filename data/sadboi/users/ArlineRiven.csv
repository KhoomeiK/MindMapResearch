The root can be used like horseradish, and the stalks can be used like asparagus. You can eat the leaves raw in a salad but I think it's better to blanch them. In my experience garlic mustard growing in shade tastes way better than in the sun, because plants in the sun will taste bitter. If I happen to get a bitter plant then I'll just combine it with something else like other greens or make it into pesto. There are some recipes online you can find for different ways to use them. Just use them like you would other dark leafy greens. They have an awesome garlic-y smell!

Lol no, common wisdom does not tell anyone this. In fact, the media, health organizations, and government officials were (incorrectly) telling people for months that masks do absolutely nothing.

You also ignored these parts of my reply:

If people aren't using masks properly, or aren't doing other transmission reduction methods, the correct solution is not to tell them not to use it. The correct solution is to teach them the proper ways to use it, and to keep them properly informed about how they should do these other methods as well.

Do you believe we shouldn't be social distancing since it's leading people to have a false sense of security?

Your example is easily countered. If social distancing measures of 6 feet were thought to be the only safe way to shop, we'd enforce social distancing right? But what if half way through that enforcement we find out that social distancing in enclosed spaces does next to nothing?

If people aren't using masks properly, or aren't doing other transmission reduction methods, the correct solution is not to tell them not to use it.

You say you've seen evidence that they're ineffective, but your own study (which you said showed that they were ineffective) showed that they were effective at blocking much of the viral load. You think that because they're not blocking all of the virus, that they are therefore ineffective. But as I said, this completely ignores the significance of a higher viral load being pushed into the air and on surfaces when no mask is present. You need a high enough dose of the virus to get infected, otherwise your immune system fights it off. When less virus is coming into your body, you have less of a chance of becoming infected (and the infection may be less severe). It's as simple as that.

From your study, the copies/mL decrease from no mask to cloth mask was around 398 c/mL down to  around 79 c/mL. That's *five times* less viral copies that are capable of infecting people now (not even taking into account travel distance of the particles). And you call this ""insanely ineffective to the point of near absurdity"" and ""basically worthless""? Really? You should get into the habit of looking at the actual data of the study rather than the author's conclusions, as people can be (and are) biased.

Yes, reducing viral load IS nice, and it's what we should be doing. You have a problem with masks because they're not highly effective on their own? That makes no sense. Your own study showed that viral load was reduced. Less viral load in the air and on surfaces = less infections, and possibly less serious infections. This can be combined with things like social distancing, and many stores are enacting both social distancing standards as well as the mask requirement. It seems to me like you just want more people to get infected because you don't feel like wearing a mask."
Coronavirus,fozw2ol,t1_fozlddw,1588197889.0,"Your study found that cloth masks don't prevent the transmission of the virus. But no one was claiming they prevented it. They help to reduce transmission, and your own study found that the viral load was reduced. 

*The median viral loads of nasopharyngeal and saliva samples from the 4 participants were 5.66 log copies/mL and 4.00 log copies/mL, respectively. The median viral loads after coughs without a mask, with a surgical mask, and with a cotton mask were 2.56 log copies/mL, 2.42 log copies/mL, and 1.85 log copies/mL, respectively.*

No one is saying you should rely on masks alone, but that they should be used in combination with other things. Reducing the viral load that's going into a person's body has been shown with other viruses to help the person's body fight off the virus better. Even if cloth masks only help a little, when combined with other things like hand washing, this all adds up to much less virus particles infecting people, and helping to flatten the curve."

Yet even 4 days before that, WHO officials were warning about the risk of h-t-h transmission and made it clear that there was the potential to catch it through water droplets and contaminated surfaces, since it could be similar to other coronaviruses like sars and mers. The same week they tweeted about China's preliminary findings, they told world leaders to look out for signs of h-t-h transmission, and take precautions as if it were already happening.

Even if some go to seed (like onion might), you can save the seed and replant it.

Also, there are a lot of wild edible plants around us, even in lawns. Some of these could be transplanted into the garden (I do this with lambsquarters, wild violet, dandelion, and wild strawberries, for example)."

[*In this paper*](https://www.pnas.org/content/115/15/3804)*, we show that plant-based replacements for each of the major animal categories in the United States (beef, pork, dairy, poultry, and eggs) can produce twofold to 20-fold more nutritionally similar food per unit cropland. Replacing all animal-based items with plant-based replacement diets can add enough food to feed 350 million additional people, more than the expected benefits of eliminating all supply chain food loss.*

[*More than one-third*](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2018-us-land-use/) *of U.S. land is used for pasture—by far the largest land-use type in the contiguous 48 states. There’s a single, major occupant on all this land: cows. Between pastures and cropland used to produce feed, 41 percent of U.S. land in the contiguous states revolves around livestock.* 

[If all the grain](https://news.cornell.edu/stories/1997/08/us-could-feed-800-million-people-grain-livestock-eat) *currently fed to livestock in the United States were consumed directly by people, the number of people who could be fed would be nearly 800 million.*

That's the point I'm making. Your comment uses the words ""easy to stay vegan"" instead of saying ""easy to stay on a vegan diet"" or ""easy to stay on a plant based diet"".

I didn't reply to the comment above yours because fayenator already pointed it out to them that it's impossible to be vegan if you aren't doing it for the animals. There would be no point to reiterating under the same comment."

vegan,fn8go9y,t1_fn80gtg,1586741230.0,"I agree pet chickens' eggs shouldn't be eaten by their caregivers (or anyone), however I disagree with the common response many vegans give that all of their eggs should be fed back to them. Eggs are much better as a treat, given sparingly. Chickens are usually given a specially formulated feed that has all the nutrients they need to keep them healthy (in addition to other food like grass, insects, and veggies). When a chicken eats her food and an egg is made, nutrients are lost throughout the process (which is why farming animals results in less calories than farming plants). When too much of her diet is her own eggs (or other chickens' eggs), you're not introducing enough of those new nutrients back into her body, you're just recycling the old ones, which could lead to deficiencies as the eggs become less and less nutritious. Maybe some of those eggs could be fed to the local birds or just thrown into the woods for other animals instead."

vegan,fn72zqa,t1_fn6zo8p,1586712296.0,"Imagine another species existed with us on this planet, that was higher up on the concept of a food chain. They know we're intelligent, have feelings, and want to live happily, free from needless harm. However, based on the concept of a food chain, they can now justify farming us against our will, breeding us with artificial insemination to produce more bodily fluids to the point where it hurts us or causes us unnecessary stress, and at the end of this, they kill us when our production declines as it's no longer profitable to keep us for that long.

You are very self aware I can see, which is great. I can relate to the feeling that you'll be missing out on food you love. I like to tell people about this one time before I was vegan, when we had a girl over my house who was a vegetarian. My mom would make lasagna every sunday (which was amazing because she rarely cooked back then), and she made it without any meat that day. Tbh it was awful. It made me kind of annoyed at the girl for being vegetarian and ruining my sunday lasagna. So believe me, I get where you're coming from, and most vegans thought this way before going vegan. (If I had to say what the issue with the lasagna was, it was that my mom removed something but didn't add anything back in. Which of course is going to make it bad.)

You may not believe this, but after about a week or two of being vegan, you really won't miss animal products, as long as you go about it the right way. Most people think vegan food sucks, but it's come a very long way. Almost any food you can think of can be veganized (go ahead, try it out in google: search up any food and put ""vegan"" in front of it). [Here's a ""meaty"" ""cheesy"" lasagna recipe,](http://www.revolutioninbloom.com/recipe/best-vegan-lasagna/) with some [white sauce](http://www.revolutioninbloom.com/basic-white-sauce/) (you could also buy vegan cheese shreds); Here's a [list of different plant-based milks](https://chooseveg.com/blog/choose-best-vegan-milk/) you can try; and some [vegan yogurt brands.](https://www.peta.org/living/food/get-cultured-with-these-vegan-yogurt-brands/) Also, if you like burgers, you should try a beyond or impossible burger. They sell them at a lot of restaurants and supermarkets now. White Castle even sells little impossible burger sliders.

Like I said, it sounds like you're already very aware of the ethical implications of your reasoning. If you need a little extra push, I would really encourage you to [watch Dominion (2018)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQRAfJyEsko&has_verified=1), narrated by Joaquin Phoenix.
