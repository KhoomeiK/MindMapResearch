It helped me to remember all the love I had for her and how that hasn't gone anywhere, and I was able to use that love to comfort me with the grief.

pics,fc0uzt2,t1_fc0pzjt,1577300336.0,"Yup. I'm learning firsthand how much not buying insurance preemptively can screw you over. Not only is it too expensive but you're only allowed to be on your parents insurance until you're 26, even if they're fine with you staying on. In fact, my mom had to fill out paperwork to remove me nearly 4 years ago. 

Now I'm needing 2 root canals because my teeth have gone to hell because I haven't been getting regular cleanings since I got kicked off. Currently trying not to stress over the $2500 that is due, in full, on day of the procedure.

Also currently trying not to kill myself or anyone around me due to the excruciating pain I've been in since before Thanksgiving.

America is great, it's all I know and freedom is great and all. But you don't feel very free when you're feeling suicidal for the first time in a decade over not having medical coverage and you can't even check yourself into a facility because that also requires medical coverage.

Fun times. Currently crossing my fingers the next man or woman in the big stupid house cab actually fucking help us. But after 2016 I'm not holding my breath and even if Tulsi or Bernie get elected they would just go the way of JFK or kill themselves suddenly.

Merry Christmas I'm depressed again"

Meditation,f6woq3o,t1_f6w6n23,1573231420.0,I believe Roshi Joan Halifax said it but I could be wrong. Duncan's podcast is the best! I highly recommend every conversation with Jack Kornfield or Rhagu Marcus.
Anxiety,f6wels5,t3_dtd0fi,1573224691.0,"This is so me. I'm literally having to put down a financial commitment to get myself to exercise. I just cannot convince myself to leave the house after work unless I make it an extreme negative to do so. 

I'm slowly learning how to get present me to do the things I need to make future me happy. It's exhausting and I have so much more work to do but I feel like it's gotten better since I gained some awareness about it. 

But hey I think this post shows that you are aware of this issue so now you can make those steps towards making a change.

Just remember, little steps. Give yourself easy victories. Small loads of laundry. Just take 15 minutes to pick up any trash or dishes around. I know for me I get so overwhelmed by the totality of it all so it's just much easier to break things down and concentrate on everything bit by bit.

I feel silly saying all this, I am by no means an authority, just struggling like everyone else. I really hope you find a system that works for you so things can improve. Good luck!"
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,f5llkl6,t3_do3jts,1572280086.0,"First of all, as the front desk worker at a hotel I completely relate to this and it's something I still struggle with.

Something that has helped me is learning that on a primal level we are programmed as humans to retain bad interactions as a means to survive. I've heard it phrased that our brains are like ""Teflon for the good and velcro for the bad"". So every time you have a good interaction with a decent person you have to try extra hard to retain it or the next jerk who walks up will take center stage no contest.

Lastly I'd consider investing in some black tourmaline and or hematite jewelry. I know alot of people think crystals and gemstones are a bunch of woo but all I know is since I started wearing tourmaline around my neck I've noticed a huge difference in how I feel at the end of the day. Grounding is super important too. 

Just remember while they berate you that you get to go home and hopefully never see that grump again and they have to live with their sad way of treating others. It's already been said that hurt people hurt others so I won't elaborate more where others have said best. 

Just remember that the only thing in this life we have any true control over is how we react. Choose to ignore the sad sacks because they're only in your brain due to biological hangups from our evolution. 

Sorry for formatting as I am on mobile. Good luck and try to not let em get you down!"
Blep,f5g0vni,t3_dnp9ho,1572188657.0,I'm so sorry for your loss. I lost my first cat baby unexpectedly last year. It sure doesn't feel like it now but eventually the pain will lessen with time. Just remember that the love you had for him (and his for you) didn't go anywhere. Now you have a little more love to give everyone else on his behalf. Take your time processing your grief and try not to feel guilty or judge yourself as you heal. Sending you light and love.

I also agree Werth finding a class and digging into a hobby. Running has also helped me immensely in rebuilding some discipline and confidence. These books aren't a fix all but they've certainly helped broaden my perspective on things.
