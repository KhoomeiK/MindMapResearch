AskReddit,fcm4wdw,t3_ehwskp,1577764317.0,"Maybe not an NDE, but when I was a teenager during summer break, I remember bike racing my friend from street to street in Brooklyn, NY. I was the one losing the race. As she sped across a streetlight, while the light was green, my dumbass decided to do the same thing without looking both ways. While crossing, I hear an oncoming car beeping frantically; too close for me evade. Turns out the street that we crossed was a street for cars who were getting off the highway. Anyway, the car is speeding my way and doesn't turn. Beelines straight towards me.

I swear when I looked at it I said to myself out loud, ""This is going to hurt."" The next thing I remember is my whole body feeling this shove (similar to someone pushing you really hard to the floor) and I'm flying towards the next street down. I fell on my face. I hear this old lady yelling in Spanish telling me that she's sorry over and over again. I could only hear her because my vision turned black. From how fast that car was going I should have died. I sat right up with a crowd surrounding me. My vision started clearing up and I got hit by a car right next to a basketball court. 

Everybody was telling me not to move because the ambulance was on their way, but I felt perfectly fine. I remember only being worried about my face in front of all those boys while I was the only girl there. I was wearing shorts and a t-shirt and left the hospital on the same day without a scratch on me. Since then I've always looked back at the day grateful to be alive and have always felt like I wasn't meant to die that day. Regardless of what people believe in, I have always felt like God protected me that day. 

I was physically abused by my alcoholic mother all my life until she passed away a year after that car hit me. Now I'm 26, with three children,  and a husband who has shown me the definition of love. Fun fact: that friend who I was trying to beat in the race tattooed my name on her ankle the next day because she thought I died. I wish that was a lie. I never got in contact with her again until I awkwardly bumped into her years later outside of a prison where she showed me the tattoo and all I could say was, ""Oh cool!"" lol..."
