Candida,fqefv1v,t3_giew2z,1589306865.0,Oil of oregano and enema seems to work well. Try and get 100% oil. You have to dilute it as its veryyyyh strong x

Candida,fpzl5w1,t3_gg41kz,1589019740.0,"Soak your rice in water and apple cider vinegar overnight then cook it, this is good for the gut as it’s pre digested. Also digestive enzymes might be a good idea and probiotics dx"

mentalillness,fpjooqr,t3_gdpsn3,1588676231.0,Eat more fruits hun and see how you feel. I was on that shitty medication and i changed my diet and i feel soooo much better. Some Kiwi and a probiotic will work wonders.
SIBO,fpjolga,t3_gdsims,1588676141.0,"Go on an all fruit diet for a weak, do monomeals and see how you feel. That worked for me. Make sure you’re going poo everyday at least wait 1 hour in between meals."
mentalillness,fpdpwws,t3_gcszpe,1588531854.0,Yeah 100% staying in the present moment for me helps and saying to myself “i am infinite love” xx

Candida,fpczc4k,t1_fpcxnn1,1588516428.0,Going really well tbh. Everyone’s different and sometimes docs aren’t always aware. You have to find what works FOR YOU
Candida,fpcvomz,t1_fpcuvq1,1588513941.0,"Fruit is sooooo high vibrational its the best thing you can put in your body, it’s naturally occurring. It only feeds the candida if you’re combining it with fat as the fat coats your cells and then any sugar will feed it. I’ve been doing trial and error and this seems to be the best method. Also other people and my naturopath said it was a good idea. Also bone broth is amazing."
Candida,fpcmorw,t1_fpbzgab,1588506234.0,Fruit is the best food you can eat. Try and get a range if colours. And if you have digestive issues one fruit at a time is easier to digest like 5 oranges instead of a fruit salad. Also i started my probiotics and cod liver oil supplements yesterday so imma see how that goes!
Candida,fpcmix9,t1_fpbl8cu,1588506069.0,"Omg same, all my friends kept saying “you need to stop researching, you’re such a hypochondriac!” Its the most annoying and belittling thing anyone can say, even doctors don’t take me seriously."

SIBO,fpclz7w,t1_fpclvh5,1588505507.0,I contacted a naturopath online and they sent everything through the post. Healthpath.com depends where you live but you should have something local?
SIBO,fpcjd1s,t1_fpcia1v,1588502720.0,"See a naturopathic doctor , they’re very aware of gut issues. I’m struggling with the SAME symptoms but i have candida.

Candida,fpbe9k0,t1_fpbdzq5,1588468007.0,Deffo worth trying! One fruit at a time is easy on the digestive system so 5 oranges or bowl of berries is better than a fruit salad. Also i found soaking your fruit and veg in baking soda and water for 15 mins gets rid of like 90% of the pesticides x
Anxiety,fpba0sm,t1_fpb9v2q,1588465327.0,Honestly if only I’d nipped it in the bud there and then. But this HELLISH experience has humbled me And taught me A LOT . Also I’m gonna try and get compensation for medical negligence :P

Candida,fpb6yc3,t1_fpb6jsc,1588463415.0,Oh okay. Check out healthpath.com not sure if they operate in Ireland but check. I had my free  15 consultation before anything so you can definitely enquire x
Candida,fpb66p4,t1_fpb5qj6,1588462948.0,"And eat organic as much as possible, pesticides can feed the candida as well. I know this is not ideal but it’ll be over soon and it really humbles us and builds character <3"
Candida,fpb61gz,t1_fpb5qj6,1588462859.0,Onions and eggs i would keep to a minimum as these easily ferment in the gut. Try and see a naturopathic doctor to get a test done as that’ll give you some answers. What country do you live in? Are the sinus issues the only symptoms?
Candida,fpb4uwb,t1_fpb3ldm,1588462148.0,"That’s amazing! :) what kind of diet are you following? because theres a lot of contradicting info online. I don’t suffer from any sinus issues only when my anxiety is playing up. (When my diet is poor) and my hay fever is worse when i eat gluten, wheat and grains x"
Candida,fpb4g2r,t1_fpb0751,1588461900.0,"You’re absolutely welcome :) . I tried almost everything and it wasn’t working for me so i went on a 7 day raw vegan diet with no oil and nuts. Just fruit and veg and soups with no oil and i felt SO much better after day 4, no bloating was pooing every morning, no constipation i felt AMAZING. 80% fruit 10% protein and 10% fat seems to work for many as well x"

Anxiety,fpazho0,t3_gc8saq,1588458948.0,"This happens to me all the time, usually if I’ve eaten sugar which I’ve decided is a nono for my anxiety. Being around other people for too long triggers this as well. good diet and exercise helps me sooo much ."
Anxiety,fpaz82q,t3_gcdc8a,1588458788.0,It can be extremely exhausting for me and I just need a moment to have a chiller. A cold shower is also really good :)

mentalillness,fow3ndi,t1_fow1lg4,1588112405.0,"Hey, i had an experience of doing too much ecstasy and it basically turned me into an overly anxious introvert and i began isolating myself away from everyone and it just got worse. However what I noticed work extremely well for me was changing my diet, eating lots of fruit and salmon especially for depression, Getting regularly exercise (even walking). The doctors put me on antidepressants and anti anxiety meds and that only made things worse.  I would encourage ANYONE to avoid these drugs unless you absolutely have to. Something that also might be helpful: I recently found out i have an imbalance in my gut after antibiotics and that is known to have a major impact on your mental health . Hope this helps xx i send love and light to you and your boyfriend :) xx"
depressed,fo073a0,t3_g4wou8,1587407228.0,The gym is also a brilliant outlet for me if that’s available where you are then that could be a possibility. Also i found listening to this helpful https://youtu.be/mfFUVnwCNVY
depressed,fo06ryp,t3_g4wou8,1587407073.0,":) don’t mention it. Just simply being aware is definitely a good first step :). I don’t how relevant this might be but also drinking plenty of water and eating a range of colourful fruit and veg helps my depression and anxiety A LOT, ESPECIALLY berries (blueberries and strawberries) and dark chocolate i send you love and light from the UK <3"
depressed,fo02ufa,t3_g4wou8,1587405108.0,"I say, dedicate a small chunk of time everyday to whatever you find joy in , possibly art and soon you’ll find clarity. Maybe 30 mins, then when you feel like you’re really enjoying it you’ll wanna spend more time :) .i’m an artist too and i sometimes lack motivation for days at a time but its normal and you shouldn’t beat yourself up but be AWARE of everything and what you can do to change it . Small steps everyday will amount to something great trust me . what works for me is keeping a journal of everyday writing how i feel, what happened during the day, even writing down if i pooped haha reallly helps get feelings out and you can then reflect later and see if theres a pattern and things worth changing. Also write a list of pros and cons for why you’ve stayed at your job might help too x hope this was helpful :)"
