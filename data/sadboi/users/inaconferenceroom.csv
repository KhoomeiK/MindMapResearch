His new girlfriend had him arrested for supposedly choking her until she blacked out. (I'm not sure if he actually did or not, all I know is that he was jailed for a bit.) She also threatened to take additional legal action against him if he left her. 

I imagine his regrets his mistakes, but I haven't spoken to him in years. All I know is that they are still together and that his family spent an absurd amount of money on legal fees."
