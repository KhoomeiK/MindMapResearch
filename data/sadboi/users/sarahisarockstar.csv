AskReddit,fitafyq,t3_f9kd1v,1582712032.0,"Back in 2001, I had Sepsis which is extremely dangerous when I was 5 years old. I was in the hospital for two weeks straight and I ended up actually dying and being brought back again.
In 2017 I was paralysed from the waist down I was in and out of consciousness for a week straight in hospital. The doctors ran tests on me from all types of cancers to meningococcal disease and meningitis. Still to this day the doctors don’t know what caused it. After 6 days all of a sudden I just got up and walked again. I still cannot remember actually walking but according to people I did it. I also remember during that time my aunty telling me ‘’It’s not my time yet”."

Anxiety,fh85n3g,t3_f1ix7e,1581352563.0,"Hey Mikie 🤗,
Nice to meet you, I am Sarah. It is wonderful to hear you have such a supportive mother. 
Having someone who can help us makes life a lot easier.
Something that helps me with my anxiety is meditation. I like listening to ‘beach sounds’ on YouTube.
I hope you have a great day.
