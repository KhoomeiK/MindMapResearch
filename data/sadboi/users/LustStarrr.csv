>The GT4 Meshed Coil is also included, and this is Vaporesso's first dual core mesh coil to be released! The performance of this coil is second to none, on par with the Mesh Pro for sure.

It relies on people being taken at their word regarding many of their symptoms, something that is unlike many other, physical forms of ailment. It's also largely been treated as a character flaw in times past, something that's difficult to move beyond for a lot of people, & that is largely responsible for many of the sanist/ableist attitudes present today.

It's been especially difficult to satisfy my thirst for knowledge since I ceased study & lost my academic access to databases, etc. 😕 I largely just resort to hassling academics for their papers via ResearchGate if I'm unable to access them elsewhere. Thanks for saving me the effort this time!  LOL  

And unfortunately, I'm an Aussie who's never left my continent, much less this hemisphere. . . 😔 If you're struggling to find participants on here, try posting it on Twitter/Tumblr/Insta/FB & hashtagging it BPD, etc."
RBI,f8v8rly,t3_e2bo3c,1574863098.0,"My dad bailed from over here in Australia & moved to the US, marrying some woman & adopting her last name, as soon as he found out Mum was pregnant. 

The Australian Child Support agency couldn't find him for my entire childhood & teenage years, despite our information-sharing agreement with US. Using what information I had - his full name, approximate month & year of birth, some idea of his new wife's name, although it turned out to be very wrongly spelled, & a basic idea of their wedding date & when he loved over their - I spent hours & hours searching & cross-referencing data, utilising heaps of those private investigator websites you come across during my search. 

As I was too poor to pay to access the information via those sites, I just kept trying different ones, out of desperation, & cross-referencing the bits of free data they offer up to pique your interest when you do a search, before they ask for payment. 

Turns out, these sites were offering free information that differed from site to site, & over time, I gradually gathered enough info to track him down! His wife refused to let me speak to him on the phone though, so after trying again to make contact & speak to him a couple of times, I finally gave up & sicced Child Support on him. 

16 years of back-paid Child Support payments hit Mum's bank account a few weeks later! Good luck with your search..."

depression,f8s9mo6,t3_e1nyjf,1574774412.0,"OP, you don't deserve this when you're already dealing with so much emotional pain - you deserve to be cared for & supported, especially by those who are tasked with your care. These adults are displaying ignorance & a lack compassion, perhaps as a way of masking their own discomfort & fear, or a sense of powerlessness. That's not to excuse their behaviour - it's uncalled for - but to offer you an alternative explanation for their anger. You don't  deserve to be treated that way for expressing your pain. 

While this experience may leave you unwilling to speak up about your thoughts of suicide in future, as you've already learned, it's a heavy burden to bear all alone. May I suggest you instead contact a suicide support organisation or helpline in your area? They can provide you with the non-judgemental, compassionate support you deserve, along with helpful advice on how to manage your thoughts of suicide, & to deal with your family & teacher's response. 

Here's some links to find support that's accessible in your area, wherever you are in the world:

* https://metanoia.org/suicide
* https://unsuicide.org

Having thoughts of suicide indicates you are experiencing deep emotional pain. It doesn't detract from your inherent value or make you any less deserving of love & compassion. You are important, & should be treated with the utmost kindness & respect, particularly when you're struggling. . . you're not alone. X"

BPD,f8ccrfh,t3_e033lw,1574457517.0,"So much this. I remember reading somewhere that BPD is linked with a poor sense of object permanence, i.e.: when something/someone is out of sight, it/they are literally out of mind to us, to some degree, & when I've considered it that way, it kinda makes sense to me... I love it when I get to catch up with my close friends & family, when it happens spontaneously or unavoidably, but when I think about organising a catch-up, getting ready for it, & actually hanging out, I feel so exhausted by the prospect of it all I just can't be f@#*ed. 😕 I feel like a shitty kid/friend, but at the same time, I also feel like they're probably better off without me & my emotional rollercoaster to deal with."

IllegalLifeProTips,f5aahh3,t1_f5a7ivz,1572103582.0,"Wow, I thought a couple of our states were slow in legalising 'sodomy', as it was termed in the Tasmanian Criminal Code until 1997:

“Any person who has sexual intercourse with any person against the order of nature… [or] consents to a male person having sexual intercourse with him or her against the order of nature, is guilty of a crime.” 'Against the order of nature’ meant anal or oral sex.

OMG, oral was illegal in Tassie til 1997 too? That's gotta be legal virtually everywhere now...
