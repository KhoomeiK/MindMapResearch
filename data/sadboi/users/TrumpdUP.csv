Leave enough room on the cardboard so the duct tap will stick well to it. It usually takes a few layers of duct tape to get it pulled down tight. Then I just stuff the open hole with a bunch of those laundry detergent tissues to absorb the smell and release a lot of that detergent smell instead. Has worked well for me.
