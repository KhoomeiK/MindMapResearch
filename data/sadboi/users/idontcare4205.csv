Yes, being responsible for 100% of rent and utilities is a drag but it is so much better than worrying about whether my roommates were going to drink their paycheck away or lose another job, making them unable to cover their rent. Having my own back is the biggest peace of mind, and it's also an incredibly empowering feeling."
