MDMA,fn4a7pl,t3_fzaujb,1586637215.0,"Here’s a tip from a med student, there’s no substance thst cancels out mdma, the only thing you can do is just wait it out or take some benzos or weed for sleep. In these cases usually they use a Foley catheter, I won’t explain how it works you can google it. Don’t try it yourself though you might get a Urinary tract infection, so yeah use that info as you may. They don’t usually require prescription but in some countries they do. And also while rolling do not and I can’t this more, do not drink more than 2 liters of water, mdma not fully but inhibits water absorption not to mention that it blocks your urethral sphincter. Stay safe 🏄🏻‍♀️🏄🏻‍♀️"

Drugs,f7dpuhd,t3_dvhp56,1573624757.0,"Have a chewing gum in your pocket and chew a lot of it cause you will grind your teeth.

Portion it don’t do it all, you can always consume more but never take it back, I’ve seen my friends pass out on their first time and hallucinate to the degree of being inadequate. (Very important this one)

Weed (highly suggest) and LSD (not so much on the first time) are the best thing on the comedown, especially if you get some visuals out of that molly.

Dance, you will feel so good whilst dancing, house music is my go to on molly. Hugging is nice but personally I hate it when I’m doing one thing and someone comes up and huggs me cause it takes the vibe away and it takes a bit to get it back.

I’m not suggesting this but on my first time I took 2 lines of ketamine and 6 vodka redbull, I was out of this world and to tell you the truth, after the first time molly won’t ever feel the same for you.

EDIT: Cigarettes and booze will taste so much better, because molly enhances your taste, go eazy on the booze go crazy on the ciggs.

That’s pretty much it."
Drugs,f7dpbs5,t3_dvgk8d,1573624190.0,"Yes, I had been bleeding constantly from my nose for 1.5 years, never even occured to me that it could’ve been all the snortint since I was 16 at the time. One time the bleeding was very bad and I went to the doctor. After checking it out turned out I had necrosis in both my nostrils where the bloodvessels were just sticking out and the doc asked if I had been snorting anything (MDMA) at that time. She used some kind of chemical to stop the bleeding and by burning the sticking bloodvessels, she prescribed me some kind of nassal cream and some nose spray, took a 1 year long break, good as new now."

depression,f2zieuc,t3_devajj,1570523633.0,"This may sound a bit radical, but what I did was minimize interactions with my family. Try doing that for a bit and see if you get at least a little positive outcome.

Your friends and everyone else is just ignorant or simply scared to ask, but they don’t hate you.

I also want you to understand that life is hard on everyone so don’t hate your mother or your brother, hate breeds only hate.

Don’t hurt yourself, you’re scarring not only your body but your soul and your mind, do not hate yourself for what someone else says to or about you.

Reaching out and telling your story isn’t shameful or pathetic it’s very brave.

If you need support or someone to talk to, you can PM me anytime, I cheer for you and believe in you so don’t give up ❤️"
SuicideWatch,f18re0w,t3_d7zskx,1569262246.0,"One thing I've learned fron this life my man is that: unless you use them they will use you.
May seem a bit nihilistic or above the line right now but in time you will realise that most of humans are nothing but animals, guided by instinct constantly reminding themselves that they are above animals. That is untrue, you have to step up be the 0.01 % and know your worth and get it. So use them as they've user you. Create the perfect trophy until they've fulfilled their usefulness and create your own perfect life."
