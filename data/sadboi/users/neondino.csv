Right now you (and I) are at the bottom of the cycle, but I promise that things do swing up again. It's the reason I'm still here. 

Honestly, get some counselling. See it as like your schooling through the crisis - it's going to teach you a ton of ways to work through and control your anxiety, and you're going to learn resilience. And you'll feel better and the world will look a little brighter, and then next time things fluctuate you'll be more equipped to climb out of it quicker.

And it will only stay not as bad as predicted because people are making sensible decisions. I know you don't feel it because you're missing out on your education, but you're lucky that you live somewhere where they're taking it seriously and so it hasn't been as bad as we feared. And the school isn't just thinking about you, they're thinking about a whole lot of stuff you're not privy to or that might not be directly related to transmission of the virus but impacts when school can start again (for example, do you keep janitors on staff and pay them when you're not sure if and when you can reopen, or furlough/lay them off knowing they'll probably get a job elsewhere and then you might not have janitors to deep clean? And is it better that those janitors not know if they're going to have a job in a month, or is better that they can plan to not be working at the school until next year?)

You seem to be getting angry that the school isn't acting in the way you want it to. As someone much older, I can tell you you're really going to struggle with your anxiety if that's how you approach life. School has made a decision that you have no control over, whether you agree with it or not.

Anxiety,fquns7q,t3_gl0i34,1589661834.0,"You could frame this as a good thing. Rather than keeping you hanging not knowing what's happening from day to day, they're giving you a relatively firm timeline that they're expecting to work to. That means you can introduce some coping strategies to help your anxiety - perhaps taking online courses for routine, or planning out how you'll keep in touch with people without seeing them in school etc. 

The people making these decisions are doing the best they can with limited information to try and create something they can stick to as it involves so many moving parts, bureaucracy, money and lives, even if it's not a decision you or they like. And more importantly, it's not something *you* can control and trying to second guess it or come up with solutions that you've no way to implement is going to spike your anxiety. Take their timeline as a positive thing in that you're not dealing with uncertainty and you can formulate a plan. If you're really struggling then I can recommend contacting a counsellor (they may be available through your school, or ask your parents if you can use one of the many online ones advertising through Reddit right now) to help you work out a way to get your feet back on more solid ground."

Either way, (and you'll never know which it was), it's clearly causing you pain.

insanepeoplefacebook,flszk6v,t1_flsudx4,1585454928.0,"Thank you, that's very useful to know."
insanepeoplefacebook,flstvi8,t3_fqt732,1585450669.0,"Can someone explain to me why there's a two-term rule? I'm from the UK, now in Canada, and we don't have term limits, just set election periods. It led to some really longstanding prime ministers. I struggle to see why it's bad to allow more than two terms, but then I have no experience of your vastly different system."
television,flpdf5a,t1_flpczz6,1585356896.0,Only in the US. We don't have access to Hulu so that content would be great.

AskReddit,fl1oh9w,t1_fl1f5vm,1584733052.0,"I was younger than her when Hong Kong was handed back to China. My dad physically put me in front of the tv and said 'this is a historic moment'. I remember that when the majority of my high school history had faded. It was important to him, so it must have been important. 

(I'm British, I think very few Brits even gave a shit at the time, let alone years later. It wasn't even covered in school. His action was my sole interaction with that event.)"
Showerthoughts,fl1i5od,t1_fl0tk79,1584729476.0,"He used to do a show in the UK where he cooked with (often hapless) celebrities and he was exactly like that. Teasing, but offering advice and championing when they did stuff right. 

It must be so annoying as well because if you work in the industry you probably know a hundred people who'd love their own restaurant and would make it amazing, and here are people who have that opportunity and they're spaffing it away."
VictoriaBC,fklocjf,t3_fj7oez,1584311031.0,"This is very generous, and well done for offering. Can I add that if you're a business who *can* afford to do so, you seek out IT companies who can implement this for you? Not being to get on site is killing us as we line up work in advance and everything is on hold (and we'll have to defer future work to catch up too).

We're based out of the lower mainland so I'm not trying to jump on your bandwagon btw, just people don't generally think of things like IT companies needing to be around people to survive, but we most often do!"
gaming,fkliyxq,t1_fklgiz4,1584307337.0,"Yeah, just the shell and buttons. You can find them on Etsy or drop shipping sites, but obviously there's differing quality. I haven't personally bought any so I can't offer a recommendation. A Gundam gameboy sounds amazing though!"
gaming,fklgfb2,t1_fkksrch,1584305759.0,"You can buy gameboy 'blanks' specifically for crafting, which were never functional gameboys. From the printing this looks like one of them."
vancouver,fk97n28,t1_fj5yym2,1583970395.0,How did you find the noise from other apartments?
Documentaries,fk81un0,t1_fk7w8na,1583947777.0,A lot of tv presenters are also actors and vice versa. Craig Charles has probably presented more shows as himself than he's acted in.
Documentaries,fk81dhi,t1_fk7rt5i,1583947523.0,"Going into it knowing it's fake makes a huge difference, it's actually quite silly. I'm a huge wuss and I've watched it with no problems."
NoStupidQuestions,fk6t7it,t3_fgn1em,1583915097.0,"My dad started grasping for words on occasion when he was in his late 60s. He got checked out at 65 after retiring due to not being able to focus at work. By 66 he was in a secure dementia facility and didn't recognise us. It's probably nothing, but the sooner you get checked out the more time you have to deal with anything that comes up, and if it is nothing, it gives you a good baseline for the future."
Showerthoughts,fk6hae6,t1_fk6h1pk,1583902149.0,"That's the logical explanation, and Ross is petty enough to turn down an amazing apartment on the grounds of wanting to look more successful. You have put my mind at ease on this plot point!"
Showerthoughts,fk6g9dd,t1_fk66roh,1583901318.0,"What bugged me with that is that the grandma passed it on to Monica, when Ross was recently married and starting a family and would've benefitted way more from the larger apartment."
AskReddit,fk5v0nv,t1_fk5u1mg,1583888395.0,"Much like Parks and Rec the first season is the weakest, so if you don't like the first couple of episodes stick with it!"
AskReddit,fk5tzop,t1_fk5qr2r,1583887842.0,"Something like Parks and Rec or The Good Place. It's an incredibly uplifting, heartfelt show, but clever enough that it doesn't feel schmaltzy."
