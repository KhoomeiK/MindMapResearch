ETA: I do find it interesting in the differences between areas though, after reading a lot of comments. Where I’m at an overdue rabies vaccine as well as puppy/kitten vaccines are considered essential. An overdue rabies is considered to be a public health risk, and a puppy contacting and spreading parvo because it can’t get its vaccines it’s also seen as essential. We’re also having to put off spaying or neutering, routine dentals, etc. unless it’s an emergency or something that needs to be done ASAP."

It’s definitely a different kind of “spicy” thank yourself. (I can eat hot chile but give me some hot curry and my tongue is dying lol). If kids don’t like it they sure as hell let you know, milk or not. If it’s making their stomach upset(which I know our food does to many not local, and I’ve had it personally done by curry) they’ll definitely let you know as well. It makes me sad that your wife wants you to stop making your traditional food because of the dishes.

I’ve wanted to be in the vet med field my entire life and plan on applying to vet school within the next year. I’m also lucky enough to work in a small clinic where I can have personal relationships with my boss and doctors. I’m able to question them and their choices (although not in front of a client of course, I just find that rude) and they educate me on the hows and the whys, but will always weigh in suggestions if they’re possible. I’m also lucky enough to be close to the point of venting about the stupid shit we deal with, who else to understand it better than other vetmed people? I know that there aren’t nearly as many people who are lucky enough to have that opportunity, so I really consider myself lucky. Even then there are definitely things that cause this, as you mentioned: elective declaws. I don’t agree with them at all and find them incredibly inhumane. I think one of the major things for me is when we aren’t able to do what we need to do to help the pet because of “owner preference.” I guess I don’t really know if that qualifies for that category, but I think that tends to weigh on me the most, outside of the not being able to save them all part."

WatchPeopleDieInside,fm3nyff,t1_fm38lax,1585730428.0,It can vary based on where you’re at. I grew up in a very rural area and most dogs spent most of their time outdoors. I didn’t know anyone who had to trim the dogs’ nails because they just wore down naturally from being outside. Now I work as a vet tech in a bigger city and we’re always trimming nails. I never even realized it was something that had to be done for dogs who spend most of their time indoors. For most dogs a walk or two a day isn’t enough to keep their nails at a good length.

Then she got her masters just a few months before I got my bachelors. Tbh it really bothers me because these were huge events in my life. And obviously they were huge in hers too, but I feel like my accomplishments were never acknowledged or appreciated because of it. Of course I’ll never mention it to her, and I haven’t actually until now. I’m proud of my mom, really I am. But it still feels shitty to have such big accomplishments overshadowed by something a little bit bigger. But once I get through vet school, that one will be mine."
