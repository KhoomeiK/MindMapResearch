> Also it's obviously important that the product launches with highest quality possible

I agree that you want to make sure you don't have any bugs but your initial product doesn't need to be perfect or even have everything you want it to have.

You need a vision of where the product is going for sure but you can start off with the bare minimum needed to gain users. Once you have a user base then it isn't out of this world to seek capital and maintain your value.

Sure it would be great if you could launch your entire idea for the product right away but that is impossible for any company of value, in my opinion, as their product is forever evolving and rightfully so."

It fucks with you for sure and I can understand your feelings but take the time to work on yourself and on noticing the red flags to help avoid abusive relationships in the future. Therapy helps as well. 

Unless you‚Äôre happy being alone but that isn‚Äôt for me. I was in a relationship with a very toxic and manipulative woman. Every time I would get away she would show me all the love I missed from her and used sex to manipulate me. Things would be great for awhile and then back to the same shit. That abusive cycle is a mind fuck. 

I hate people who play games like what OP posted. Truly sickens me but they get off on it and they aren‚Äôt going away. Best to look inwards and figure out why I was attracted to that person, why I allowed it to go on for so long and how to avoid it in the future.

Nothing wrong with wanting to be with someone who is financially stable and can take care of themselves. But that isn‚Äôt the only thing you said you want. You want prestige from what I‚Äôve read in your post and comments.

Like attracts like. I would take what your friend said to heart and consider seeing a therapist about why you‚Äôre attracted to men who seem to constantly disappoint you.. along with reading some books. 

You even mentioned you got out of a relationship recently and are already back to dating.. Maybe take sometime to work on yourself instead. 

You ever hear about that story about the hamster? Hamster runs around the room and the mother chases it but never catches it. Every time she sees it she goes after it and doesn‚Äôt catch it. The moment she doesn‚Äôt chase it and sits down it jumps into her lap. 

Work on yourself and perhaps what you‚Äôre looking for will fall into your lap.

Sure, if you expand your age range it's more likely you'll run into folks in a different life stage than you are, but even that isn't guaranteed.
