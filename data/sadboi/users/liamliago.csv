Anxiety,fc4wt4q,t3_eg62xd,1577431727.0,"I've been reading the comments and wanted to tell all of you who worry about being annoying...

1. Most of the time, everyone around you is worrying about themselves and what those around them are thinking about them, just as you are them. Most of us have some sort of social anxiety to some degree, some worse than others. What I'm saying is, most people are busy doing what people do: thinking about themselves, not you. Take comfort in that. 
2. This is YOUR world. I know it doesn't feel that way. But think about this.  If you're being SO somehow annoying to someone that you need to be silently worried, then it should be the responsibility of the person your annoying to call you out üò° üòÇ and signal their annoyance at whatever you're doing! I'll being facetious, of course, but if this were really true, that you are really annoying, this would happen. My point is though, you shouldn't have to walk on eggshells and read minds of you are getting on someone's nerves!!!  If you are abiding by social norms within reason (of all our different, beautiful quirks), you should be able to leave those worries alone, which brings me to my next point.
3. What happens in someone else's mind is their problem and no one else's. I am only responsible for what goes on in my mind, and you in yours, and so on. Unless I am intentionally annoying someone, I am not responsible if they feel annoyed by me. I am not even responsible for being aware of it, only that my behavior meets my standard. 
4. Leaving other people's minds and behavior to them frees me to focus on me, what I am really about, what I'm interested in.
5. Whatever your disability, your fear, your need, you have the right to try. You are no less of a human than anyone else. Don't let people talk you down with fear and intimidation. Listen to wisdom. Believe in your abilities; you have more than you'll ever use. Believe in you. Be real with yourself. Be logical, be truthful. Try. Always try. Try again and again. If people don't want you, keep being you till you find your people. Be good, be kind. Be who you want other people to be in the world. 

Because when you realize where you belong, no one else's thoughts, opinions, or beliefs matter.  Not even mine.  

YOU matter. Make good memories with your life. Enjoy it!"
