If you are literally saying what whatever caused this universe to exist (assuming it was caused) is what you are calling God then fine, if I have good reason to believe the universe was caused then when we talk we can label that cause God.

But that doesn't allow you to slip anything else through, no intent, no consciousness, no caring, no powers, not even an existence in our current universe. ""God"" is simply a label for the cause.

Also it's easy to get confused using your wording of ""God is the cause"".

Because to some it might imply intent from a being that is God ""causing"" the origin of the universe.
While to others ""God"" is simply a label that we're applying to whatever the cause is.


If we ever converse then sure I'll call the cause God, but outside of that I won't. Not only is it pointless given we'll almost certainly have a better label, it also gets confusing given the millions of variations in what God means to people."

You mean looking at what is evident in reality and then trying to squeeze it into the Bible narrative to prove yourself correct...

I don't know if this is true and can't be bother to grab my bible at this moment, but is it not just as reasonable to assume that they just started with the least like man and then built up to the extraordinary and magnificent finale that is MAN!! ? 

&#x200B;

> Is it possible that this might make the creation story plausible in some way and therefore remove one of the key arguments against the bible 

I personally think it's an utterly pointless act. If we change the story to make it more plausible then of course we're left with a more plausible story, but it's also a different story...

You can twist anything to make it sound reasonable if you want to, but why? I really want to know, what is the point of this task?

You're not proving your God got it right by correcting all the parts that are wrong then ignoring them, you're just making yourself look like a fool that's in denial.

It proves nothing and adds nothing of worth to the world, all i can see it doing is easing the minds of a few religious folk that refuse to take a look at the world around them and realize that their ""infallible"" book might actually be fallible if taken as it's written.

2. Pay me $1,000, lying = Nothing

So if you pay me $1,000 you don't *really* lose anything and can go to heaven. If not, then sure you might not go to hell, but if I am telling the truth (and I am), then it's hell for you.  As a result you should pay me $1,000, [no?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBS0OWGUidc)

God is not conclusively real and while used by theologians, is not used as an explanation by historians (as far as I know from my limited interactions with historians).

Because you need God to exists for the resurrection using it as evidence seems to lead back to circular reasoning i.e Jesus resurrected because of god and I know god exists because Jesus resurrected.

I could substitute God with Shrek and they'd have to accept it as true, accept that God is not a necessity in the resurrection (making the argument useless in a God claim), accept that there isn't sufficient evidence to believe that a human resurrected, let alone was the son of God, Or possibly say it has to be taken in context of all the evidence, meaning the resurrection isn't actually the convincing factor after all... (conclusion likely not reached instantly of course)."

If this is the only issue and your teacher won't adjust their position on the definition then for the sake of the class use that definition.

Understanding what's meant is the most important thing, words are meant to be functional, not objective.

My only concern would be making sure the class understands that there are people that don't believe God exists but also don't believe he doesn't that are only addressing the belief question.

It's easy for people to assume that if you don't take a position, then you necessarily take the opposite, which (as evident in this community) is not always the case.

Atheist - A way I kinda remember it is:

Because what's being addressed is **belief**, in the statement  ""I believe a God exists"", you should be focusing on the ""I **believe**"" NOT ""God exists"".

So the counter position is ""I **do not believe** a god exist"" rather than ""I believe a God **does not** exists"", because that would be addressing your knowledge position on the existence of the God rather than your belief.

They look and sound very similar and belief and knowledge do influence one another, but they are not the same.

&#x200B;

That said, as kinda mentioned before, just ask for their position rather than their label then move on from their."
DebateAnAtheist,fiu68vw,t3_f9vz0z,1582735852.0,""" the Universe must be caused by something that is itself uncaused"" Why? Can you prove this statement true?

Why can the ""causer"" be uncaused but not the universe? How do you know the universe isn't for example expanding and contracting infinitely?

Assuming one accepts your assertion to be true, and given the fact you're a self professed ""firm Catholic"", why do you believe that the causer of the universe also has all the other attributes you assign to your god? (e.g. consciousness to some degree, gives a shit about earth and humanity)."

TalkHeathen,fitnf0a,t3_f9owvb,1582724939.0,"Their definition fits anti-theist, not atheist so they are wrong and it's definitely worth explaining.

For a period I even believed that new age atheists redefining the word to avoid the burden of proof (as spouted by some theists) was actually true, until I checked my parents dictionary published in 1911 that has Atheism defined as ""Disbelief in the existence of a God"".

If a 100 years ago doesn't count as before ""new age atheism"" then i need to see an older dictionary.

Theism addresses belief, Gnosticism addresses knowledge.

That said, if this wasn't in a formal lesson on the education of religion and religious positions i'd suggest you focus on definitions FAR more than the words themselves. You need to know a position someone holds, NOT the position that you define their label to mean."
