writing,fqf7f6w,t3_gieenu,1589319970.0,"Some of my all-time favourite books are non-fiction, but it's not because of their subject. They were written so poetically that they felt like I was reading Watership Down. Salem Possessed by Paul Boyer and Stephen Nissenbaum and Killers of the Flower Moon by David Grann. The first is about the social origins that created the Salem Witch Trials (trdl two rival families each had too many kids and each wanted the other families' land to split up amongst the kids when they died, and the rest of the town caught the trend bug and used the trials as an excuse to settle personal baggage), and the latter is about how the government tried to systematically wipe out an entire native tribe that to this day was the wealthiest group per capita in history.

Basically, the government gave them what they thought was a horrible piece of land as a reservation, only to find out it was sitting on a giant oil reserve. They took a ton of money from an oil company to allow them to drill, and the American government does as it does whenever anyone finds oil and tried to take the land back. When they refused, tribe members started showing up dead or missing. So the tribe hired the best P.I.'s in the country and this group of investigators ended up forming and developing what is currently the FBI. I actually haven't even finished this one yet, but it doesn't read like non-fiction, that's for sure. Salem Possessed does, but in a poetic prose fashion. Killers of the Flower Moon reads like straight up historical fiction except everything is true.

So yeah, I strongly agree that non-fiction does not have to be (and quite frankly shouldn't be) so cut and dry."

My mother can only show me sympathy about my mental health when she's drunk.

And she has quit drinking.

writing,fg6h3xe,t3_ex4l7b,1580567802.0,"It depends. If it's important to the story? Yeah. If it's just a long paragraphs describing some dining table chairs? Gtfo. Have you talked about how a character has super unique pretty ice blue eyes in the last 50 pages? Then don't bring it up again, it's redundant and readers will skim over the whole rest of the line. But this, too, all depends on the mood of the book. If it's a journey type deal or something with ties in nature, the descriptiveness will give your book the desired slow-mo effect you're looking for.

For example, a common reason people don't like Stephen King is that his descriptions get so long that you get distracted from the actual plot. But on the flip side, Watership Down is a book that's over 500 pages about bunnies looking for a new place to live after their home is destroyed. It's a lot of description of rolling hillsides and the skies and all the like, which technically is all in a 5 mile radius. And that book honestly could have used *more* description.

But as a closing point, I'd just like to say that authors need to trust their readers more. You don't need a shit ton of description for people to see the character you see. I once hand-wrote a few pages of my latest project, so in total you would have known the character for less than two typed pages, and never once mentioned a single physical thing about him. When my best friend read it, she said the whole time she could only picture Alex Pettyfer as the MC; he was exactly who I pictured when writing him. And since then I've had many other people tell me the same thing with those same few pages. The stronger your character development, the less you need to tell the readers what they look it."

I've deleted them from my Recycling Bin. I've deleted them from my drive. I've deleted my mods folder as whole. And they will not go away. They've been breaking my game for months and still haven't been updated, so I'm stuck with LE's and stray pets with no traits."

BPD,fda5bwb,t3_ekdjm9,1578241882.0,"I feel the same, it's a trauma response. A lot of memories of my dad cut out part of the way through, like a VHS tape that a parent self-cut a specific scene of. Oddly enough, though, my memories from like 2-3 are pretty strong, which is right before the court decided I was old enough to spend every other weekend away from my mom and I had to start going to my dad's, which suggests that I have a very strong memory, so my blocked out parts aren't normal. They tend to try and resurface in my night terrors."
