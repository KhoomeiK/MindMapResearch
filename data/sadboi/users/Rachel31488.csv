Also I just want to make it clear for anyone who makes it seems as if I’m a freeloader - I’m a graduate student and will be interning in January. I work my ass off in life and my bfs know this hence why they offered to cover the rent and groceries. I will work when I can safely find a job again and I’m interning. It’s very odd to me that people find this strange as they were doing this anyway and many of gfs in LA are taken care of as they are stay at home moms or housewives. I can see how this would be strange for a small town person though. These men are well off and don’t need my money. And believe it or not - they love me."

We have spoken everyday, all day for years. I have spoken to their therapists and real life friends. I talk to their mother. 2/3 bfs in my life came from the Internet. The only one that ended terribly and with trauma was from my last one I met in real life. 

Two of them are also from one of the wealthiest families in south Florida. Their family is very well known here and internationally. One is literally flying here to drive w me 40 hours cross country. I am grown enough and self aware at 32 to know what I’m getting into and have a back up plan.

dating_advice,fibpglz,t1_fibolot,1582327074.0,"I think that depends if the answers are coming from women or men and the age group. Men become bitter and cold once rejected too many times and think that it’s because women crave toxic men. I would listen to women over men. 

Anyone who is seeking out a bad boy etc is emotionally immature and probably has trauma/issues they need to work through. That was me in my 20s and the relationships were long, but very unstable and tumultuous. It will not get you what you want, except women like this. 

Now that I’m in therapy (actually in grad school to be a therapist, lol) and older, I’m repulsed by those sorts of men and am with a guy who others would be deemed a pushover because he moves mountains for me. He’s younger (23) so his friends make fun of him for it. But our relationship is strong and close and I appreciate his kindness and vulnerability so much. 

it’s hard for me to tell what the issue is when I don’t know you or see how you interact with others. Sometimes men did come off unsafe to me when they became TOO nice or clingy too fast. I felt they could become obsessive. But if you’re contacting a normal amount, demonstrating chivalry, being chill, and letting her pretty much guide it in the beginning to her pace... you just haven’t found the right one. 

The number one thing over all is to always make sure the woman feels safe with you and you respect the boundaries that are set.

Maybe say you can respect that and if there’s anything you can do to improve in the future. If you’re getting the same advice over and over... take hints. Keep listening to women’s feedback. We are all different and desire different things. If it’s you, you’ll hear the same pattern about yourself.
