UnsentLetters,fovnhcg,t3_g9ly77,1588104296.0,"you know, coming from someone who have had this type of message sent to myself, i don’t know how i’m supposed to feel after reading this. a friend of mine told me that “i don’t want to be your therapist all the time”. and i understand totally that normal people are not responsible to deal with mental illness, but sometimes it’s so difficult to ask for professional help. i don’t blame you for thinking this way because if the roles were reversed, i know i would probably feel like this as well. i just had tears stinging in my eyes when i read it, idk. sorry."

SuicideWatch,flyd3zt,t1_flycbwd,1585599913.0,thank you. it's very reassuring to know that.
SuicideWatch,flybjjj,t1_fly9jrv,1585599080.0,"i'm sorry that it had to be this way. i understand the curiosity aspect of it, sometimes i'm the same. i don't blame you, and it feels kind of sad to leave like this. even though we didn't get much conversation in."

SuicideWatch,flxx3e8,t1_flvb5y3,1585591471.0,"hey, i'm sorry but i don't think i can continue our conversation. i know you have every intention to take my mind off of my dark thoughts, that's why you're suggesting many things for me to keep busy. and i'm sorry that most of the times it's very overwhelming for me. and i wish i can carry on a normal conversation with you, for you to get to know me better, and vice versa. but right now i don't think i'm in the right state for that, and i don't know if i'll ever be. i'm thankful that you reached out to me since my first post on this subreddit. i'm sorry."

SuicideWatch,flsupck,t3_fqtx8q,1585451271.0,"I think I’ve been trying to convince myself before that I wouldn’t mind if I died, that because life has been so cruel to me I wouldn’t miss it when I’m gone. 

But a couple of months ago I realized that maybe I would. Something hit me when I was on my way to school one day.. I would miss the breeze that day, the sun that was shining, the chill I felt when I stayed outside for too long. 

Sometimes life seems beautiful, but I won’t be here to experience it. I know I have a limited number of blue skies I’ll get to see. I know I can’t stay to enjoy all of it, and that deep, internal sadness will always be in me."

selfharm,flkqbw3,t3_fpbqaq,1585245694.0,"nobody has said this before, but the reason besides that it's sharper is because i don't have to see the physical blade slicing my skin. the top of the razor hides it for me, since i can't stand the sight of seeing something cutting into my arm."
SuicideWatch,flhdodl,t3_fonh2a,1585160717.0,"“I don’t understand how you can do that to yourself.” 

If anything this is what irked me the most. People who don’t have mental illness just can’t understand. They can’t understand why we want to inflict pain on ourselves simply just to cope. They can’t understand the desire of wanting to leave this world because we feel like there’s nothing in it for us. 

The worst thing for them to do is voice their thoughts, and it makes you feel worse. Like someone so corrupt and people have to be disgusted with you. Maybe she didn’t mean anything bad, but those words are haunting. There are people like us who are full of self-hatred that we can’t get rid of, and harming ourselves is the only thing we’ve ever known."

SuicideWatch,flbocge,t3_fnpjco,1585008917.0,I think your last paragraph sums it up for me. I don’t have access to anything. I have no foolproof way to die. So I’m only alive because of that.
UnsentLetters,flb6tja,t3_fnikw0,1584998560.0,If only someone fucking cared about me this much.
