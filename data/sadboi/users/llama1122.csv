But once I've ended it, there's no reason for us to contact each other again, so I remove that as an option

Obviously I just mean at the beginning. If it's an actual relationship, there is more involved 

But when things are over, they are over. Doesn't mean that person is a bad person or I hate them, I'm just not interested in hearing from them again. The intent certainly isn't petty at all 

Again, just how it works for me, so it could be something similar for those people who blocked you (or another reason, who knows). It's very routine for me. I wouldn't care if the guy blocked me either. Like why do we need to have available communication? I don't really need to explain myself once things are over. He likely won't know he's blocked since he's not texting me when it's done. If he is trying to text me, then I guess I'm glad I've blocked him.

In the relationship where my ex cheated, I also don't blame myself for why he cheated. (I mean, I'm trying not to blame mysel, it's a long and difficult process) but I can still look back at parts of the relationship where I was not the best. 

I mean, there are abusive relationships where the victim isn't at fault either. So there are a few instances. 

That being said, if a person is the victim for all their failed relationships, that's kinda a red flag. 

I have chatted with guys who blame their exes for everything, keep calling them crazy, all that kind of thing, that's something to be worried about.

It's happened a few times where I'd like multiple posts at one time but it doesn't mean anything from me. Of course, it could for others"
datingoverthirty,fond5yt,t3_g8fyfw,1587917199.0,Once a guy stole my camera from me. That was pretty awful. I was very under the influence at that time so I blame my poor judgment. Hopefully won't be in that situation again
cf4cf,folxhct,t3_g1tayq,1587872847.0,Please come to Canada. And bring all your cats. And you can sing opera to my cats and me!
datingoverthirty,folwoye,t3_g84mqw,1587872297.0,'It's been nice getting to know to know you but I'm not interested in pursuing this any further.' you can include something like 'best of luck' at the end if it seems fitting
datingoverthirty,foldiuj,t3_g80jqc,1587859924.0,"I probably wouldn't mention it. 

Why not just swipe on those types of guys? 

I generally only swipe on guys who I find attractive. So only they can really message me. That seems fairly logical to me lol, am I missing something? :P"
datingoverthirty,fojzpb2,t1_fojvitw,1587832622.0,"Np. And that's totally okay, we can't be compatible with everyone lol"
datingoverthirty,fojp7wf,t1_fojon4e,1587826415.0,"I get that. Nothing wrong with wanting stability. 

I personally felt really bad turning this guy down. We got along great. But I didn't think it would be the type of relationship I wanted, with stability, support, equality. 

There is that stigma about disability. Like it's okay to be wary of seeing someone on it. It's okay if that's just not right for you."
datingoverthirty,fojo9ae,t3_g7sy37,1587825800.0,"This sounds very similar to a situation I was just in. I was talking to this guy for a few weeks. It was awesome. We got along really well. I am doing okay career-wise (not great but I'm 29 and I'm very happy with where I am), I own my home, look after my cats, etc. He has multiple mental health issues (like I do have mine but all very managed right now), he's still deciding if he wants to go back to school or what, he lives with his parents, works part time at his parents' business. 

I felt terrible ending it. But I need someone more equal. Mostly, being financially stable and independent. 

It took me a bit to come to that conclusion and I still regret it a bit but I know it was the best decision"
datingoverthirty,fojh1zg,t1_foj0qio,1587820689.0,"I kinda understand what you're saying. I feel like our texting styles wouldn't match probably which is perfectly fine, I think we'd just have different expectations 

But yeah, I don't have notifications turned on because it gets really annoying to have tinder notifications pop up all day. So I try to respond to messages every evening. But if I'm working one evening or tired or out with friends then it can still be over 24 hours. 

If someone is expecting a reply every 24 hours, we probably just wouldn't be a great match which is totally okay. 

I certainly do have intentions of meeting IRL, generally after a week or so of chatting, that's what I try to go by. Depends on my schedule. I often tend to be relatively busy but not too busy to go on dates, I'll make the time for that"
datingoverthirty,foifg2j,t1_foif4du,1587785401.0,"Oh gotcha! Well idk how long this is going to take lol. Might get pretty lonely haha 

I'm not actively on dating apps now though. There are a couple guys I've been talking to. But I just ended things with the main guy I was talking to so I might not do much more video chatting anyway lol 

I think practice though. I've been working on my general social skills and stuff like that a lot in the past few months so it's probably paying off lol"
datingoverthirty,foieyr1,t1_foiej43,1587785089.0,"What do you mean by just waiting it out? 

I guess, like, I've been video calling my friends and family a lot lately. So I'm okay calling a guy I'm talking to too. I think just practice. I'm just not as anxious about it anymore. My anxiety is improving a lot though so I think that's it"
datingoverthirty,foie7fk,t3_g7h2qe,1587784589.0,"I was married but he passed away. It wasn't a long marriage. I was happy in it, until some stuff happened, and I was unhappy. 

I would be open to getting married again for sure. I like the idea of spending my entire life with someone. It would be nice to settle down. 

It's not like you have to though. If you just want a long term relationship, that's perfectly fine"
datingoverthirty,foidsub,t1_foi0631,1587784328.0,"Yeah, exactly!!

Sometimes it takes longer than 24 hours to reply. I don't have notifications turned on so I will sometimes just miss it and not reply super quickly"
datingoverthirty,foidn9d,t3_g7m7rd,1587784226.0,"I used to hate them due to social anxiety. 

But now, with this pandemic, I've started calling and video chatting more often so I'm kinda okay with it"
