The urine test for fentanyl is a very specific one and is usually only ordered under those circumstances. It's also kind of expensive, so I don't think most doctors would go around ordering it for no good reason. I don't think they test for any substances when they're checking your kidney function. Hope this helps to put your mind at ease."

Some people do this simply because they're terrible people who get a sick pleasure out of dragging others down. Other people will do it to make you feel worthless so they can better manipulate or control you. Sometimes it's a twisted combination of both.

But after dealing with depression on and off for the last 15 years I've learned that depression doesn't need any reasons to manifest. Sometimes it can be brought on by negative events or circumstances, but for a lot of people it just happens. For whatever reason our brains don't work the way they should. There are so many different chemical processes going on in there, and they can go haywire in a lot of different ways.

Now I look forward to spending most of my time at home basically doing nothing. It feels like a total lack of ambition and drive.

I got hired through the agency by a 3rd party. I'm officially employed by one company on behalf of another company and I get paid through the agency. It's kind of a weird setup, but it works and I'm not getting screwed over on pay or anything like that. The agency I'm going through is called Express Employment Professionals, and they seem to have offices all over the country, in the US at least. 

The process was pretty simple. It was pretty much like filling out a regular job application and then consenting to a background check. They did a drug screen as well, but they did that right there in the office. They had those cups with the test strips built into them. They've been really good about keeping in touch and making sure that I knew exactly where to go and what I needed as far as work gear (I'm in IT, but it's an industrial setting, so I needed steel toe shoes, safety goggles, etc)."

I just happened to see an ad for this place on Facebook, so I sent them a resume. They called me the next day with a job that offered better pay and was closer to home for me. 

Might be worth a shot if you have something similar nearby. A lot of these places have all kinds of different positions available, factories, warehouses, call centers, janitorial services, etc, and most of those jobs pay better than retail or food service."

It sounds like your fiance has some deep, deep issues with her self esteem. It's one thing to feel a little bit of envy, but it's something else entirely to actively sabotage a friend's efforts and to shit talk them behind their back. This is not normal, but it sounds like you're well aware of that. 

Your fiance needs to speak with a professional. Whether or not you wish to continue with your plans for marriage after seeing this ugly behavior is something only you can decide. But I would certainly advise against getting married without her first sorting out her issues."
Unemployment,ffeuimv,t1_ffekyfz,1579866119.0,"I've never had to file a UI claim, so I have no idea how it works. Are you eligible for UI if you were fired? I will definitely give it a try, anyhow. Can't hurt. 

One of my coworkers who I'm also friendly with outside of work was sitting right next to me when the supervisor was talking about how the absence would be excused. I texted her to tell her about what happened and I even asked her about what the supervisor said, just to make sure that I didn't mishear or misunderstand what was said. She confirmed it. I'm just still kind of in shock. 

The company was bought out and taken over by a former competitor not too long before I started working there. Apparently there have been policy changes since the takeover. My guess is that excused absences for bad weather was something that was done before the takeover, but the new company decided to discontinue that. But STILL, getting fired for something that I was told was ok by a supervisor is complete and total crap. And them not letting me know until almost a week after the fact and then telling me in the middle of a shift is insanity. 

It's company policy that whenever somebody quits or gets fired that they are escorted out of the building. Their supervisor has them clean out their locker, turn in all company owned equipment, and then they are walked to the exit and have to turn in their badges before they can leave (badge gives building access and secure room access in addition to being used to punch in/out). So when you're seen being walked through the building by the supervisor with an armload of stuff, everybody knows what happened. Kind of embarrassing. 

Sorry to go on and on. I'm just kind of venting. I've never been fired from a job before and I never thought I would be fired over something so stupid."
