You get checked on every 15 minutes at night. By a nurse. People do have severe mental illnesses, like schizophrenia, bipolar disorder etc, and the reason they are in a psychiatric hospital is likely because they attempted to hurt themselves or someone else. So, they will act that way, like really sick people who aren‚Äôt very in touch with reality at the moment. There are codes that signify fights or attempted suicide, and these codes will happen at least once a day (in my experience). 
The cafeteria is highly monitored, there is no glass or anything breakable, and you have to leave your plastic utensils in a special bin while someone watches you. 
It‚Äôs not exactly like the movies, but it is scary and you lose a lot of autonomy. People are going through their worst times, and that‚Äôs scary too.
