I’m a strings major, so they’re all strings instruments, but I’d like to learn the sax as well someday. I also compose. I study the history of music in different cultures and also the effect that music can have on the brain, because if my dream job doesn’t work out I want to be either a musicologist or a music therapist. My dream would be to make apps for children undergoing music therapy, since I’m good with some programming and a lot of graphic design stuff too.

I like that song! When I was younger, my dream job was to compose the sound tracks to video games, so video game music has a special place in my heart.

My boyfriend and his roommates and friends are the people I consider my best friends. They’re all computer science majors. I’m sort of the odd one out in our little friend group, but I’ve been told that I’m generally considered to be the leader of our squad.
