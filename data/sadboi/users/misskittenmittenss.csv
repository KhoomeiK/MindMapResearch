cats,fpdtufh,t1_fpdhsmg,1588534113.0,"Thank you for your comment, it's good to know I'm not the only one with a broken cat. Duchess has the same issues around brushing. She hates it and bites and scratches when I try to brush her. I also try and use sweets for her to be distracted while brushing. I do always say the ""no"" but my girl is ridiculously stubborn.  

I think it's just gonna be loads of time of giving her her space and loads of love. I just get so confused when she sits on my lap for cuddles or lies down on the floor all paws up for rubs and then suddenly lashes out. Even with headscratches when she clearly asked for them she sometimes lashes out."
cats,fpdfs96,t1_fpdfenh,1588526134.0,Yeah it's super weird. I've had her for two years now and she has gotten much better than before and its only happened once or twice that she's actually bitten me to the point where it actually really hurt so I'm hoping with a lot of love and patience as well as her getting older and hopefully maturing (she is three and a half now) she'll get better and nicer ☺️
cats,fpdezm5,t1_fpdefzc,1588525687.0,"I don't allow it. She is a rescue and when I adopted her she already had these behaviours. They didn't really know why or where it came from. Thing is, she's the absolute cuddliest thing in the world and wants loads of cuddles and attention and is so sweet and then suddenly she'll just flip. It's almost like her software crashes or something. It's hard to correct this behaviour as punishment would only make it worse. When she bites I just move her away from me and ignore her but this hasn't fixed the issue so far."
cats,fpctnbi,t1_fpctknf,1588512371.0,Haha het actual name is Duchess but I barely ever call her that. She's both the cuddliest and the bitiest thing ever

I have been going running every single day. I make smoothie bowls because somehow copying fitness youtubers makes me less shit about eating (lol what am I), I try and eat mainly veg at night. 

I also follow HIIT work outs online (I really like Natasha Oceane) and do butt/abs/arms/glutes/etc work outs as well. On top of that I do yoga. I pick about three things a day (so run + HIIT/yoga + one or two muscle groups). This kinda helps me calm but it is still really really hard."

Maybe this could help for you too"

To actually answer your question: I arrived at the library at 1 today and there was enough space. I'm still here and although busier there is still some space. My friend was here at nine and she said between 9-11 there was still a lot of space everywhere, like a lot. Last week was busy but I think this week is ok. :) Apart from that I study in cafés but I don't know if you find them too loud"

Groningen,fc56vp5,t3_eg9pra,1577446272.0,"Ik wil je in elk geval afraden bij de ANWB in Groningen te gaan rijden. Buiten dat het relatief duur is moest ik mijn rijlessen steeds weken (soms anderhalve maand) van te voren inplannen, anders zaten ze vol. Daardoor kon ik heel vaak niet bij mijn vaste instructeur terecht en heb ik denk ik wel bij zes instructeurs gereden die het dan allemaal net ietsje anders willen. Daarnaast wou mijn vaste instructeur me maar niet laten afrijden, terwijl, als ik vanwege hun zwakke rooster met een van hun andere instructeurs reed, deze elke keer tegen me zeiden dat ik wél moest afrijden. Hier menig discussie over gevoerd en uiteindelijk bij een van hun andere instructeurs gaan rijden, waarna ik binnen twee weken mocht afrijden en met gemak slaagde (wat wil je ook, na tien tot vijftien eigenlijk overbodige maar dure extra lessen). Daarnaast zei m'n eigenlijke instructeur vaak tegen me dat ik een religie moest zoeken. Dat was ook...interessant. Conclusie: administratief een beetje een zooitje, instructeurs die je te lang niet laten afrijden en ik ben nog steeds geen religie rijker."
