I say anxiety because catastrophic thinking is a pretty tell tale sign of it. Also, it doesn't have to be a severe mental illness to affect certain parts of your life. I've been anxious since I was twelve and had varying degrees of it. Finding the right terminology like catastrophic thinking is a really important step, at least it was for me, to being aware of it and working to make it better. My biggest stressors are finances. And that may be yours too. It might benefit to take practical steps like a savings account to release some of that anxiety regarding money."

She can't recognize one right now probably. It probably feels out of reach. She may feel extra vulnerable or she may finally feel a release of her anxieties knowing that her secrets are out in the open. Most likely a little of both. Neve push her to discuss these issues early on and pleaseeee do not immediately attribute any of her actions to her past mistakes. Like, she's acting this way because she was abused. 

She's trying to become a better and new person, hopefully, and she can't do that with her partner holding her past over her head. 

You guys are doing good so far, being open and honest. Don't ever stop that. That will be a skill that needs to always be utilized. Use empathy and understanding to hear her thoughts. I'm sure she's got plenty to say, but she's got to be ready to say it. 

With trauma of. My own, I had sex again later many times but didn't realize I wasn't mentally ready. I would cry afterwards and have flashbacks. 

It's far more important you two talk beforehand and afterwards so you're both comfortable. 

Do as much research as you can on her behalf to understand her position. 

Best wishes!"

Anxiety,erp0sn8,t3_c33pv0,1561095039.0,"My only comment from sort of being the female in this situation: just make little comments here and there in everyday situations and do it as quickly after or during the situation as possible. 

For example, you two start talking about a sensitive topic and you want to say that it's making you feel a certain type of way (maybe try to use more descriptive words than just anxious), so just say a little sentence. Like, ""I'm confused by what you mean"" instead of watching the situation unfold and questioning her intent. Because she probably doesn't even know she's doing anything to cause you anxiety. 

It's better IMO than waiting after the fact to bring up your anxious feelings. She'll associate your feelings with the situation and it'll be easier to correct how she comes across. We all remember how someone has made us feel. 

I hope some of that made sense at least lol."

Don't know who your student loan is through, but they should allow you to see how much is going to principal and how much is going to interest. With that in mind, pay a little twice a month. It takes off interest essentially. So, like the 10th and 20th of each month. There are apps out there that will compare consolidation loans for you if that's what you think you need. If your student loans are 4% or less that's best.

You're doing great. 26 with a degree and 50k job. Do you have an IRA or roth through work? Can you contribute more to have them match more? Always worth asking.

Also, just ask yourself what your biggest priority is? Saving money for family it sounds like. So, to make it more fun maybe think of specific goals like (I want to save X amount for a family vacation to Cancun in two years) or (I want to save 6 months worth of daily expenses so we can take a family trip across the midwest).

Before that, I only gave myself a one year commitment to a job and it truly was a stretch to make it that far. It was in healthcare though. 

Once I realized I didn't want to do the whole rat race thing, I've been itching to just pack up my (now nonexistent) car, pick a flight at the airport, and camp for an indefinite amount of time. Mainly cause of the cost but also for the tranquility.
