Also for offensive GKs clearing is very crucial, other than reflexes and awareness of course. Defensive GKs need a lot of reach too. 

I think that's why a lot of defensive GKs tend to be taller than 190cm (other than Oblak) because they have more reach naturally, eg Buffon, Handanovic, Toldo, Courtois, Cech."

The last season was a bit of a disappointment given the fashion we were kicked out the UCL but the domestic treble is still a historical achievement that I'm sure other teams won't hesitate bragging about even if they diss us for it.

Prioritising one trophy over the other is a bit of a gamble as we've learned from LFC, and I'm proud of the team for holding down the fort in all but one competition throughout a season crippled by injuries and a lot of other crap.

To add, I'd keep the CL at top importance for now, but say we can't get the ban reduced or lifted then fuck the UCL, league dominance is more than enough. Knockout competitions are definitely not a representative of how a team's season went every week, but teams fetishize the UCL for whatever reason."
