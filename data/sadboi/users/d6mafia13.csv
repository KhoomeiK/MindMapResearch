AmItheAsshole,fpy3uh0,t3_gflupe,1588995418.0,"Obviously you're NTA.

I don't want to sound mean when I say this as I've gone through something similar in the past so please don't be offended..

I think it's possible that this group of ""friends"" aren't actually your friends and just befriended you to mess with you because they think it's funny. Even though you're in treatment I'm sure you're still v eccentric and probably say weird things sometimes. I'm sure they've noticed. It's possible they have you around just to mess with you because they are absolute disgusting garbage people. I'm extremely mentally ill and have had people do something similar to me and it really hurt when a real friend of mine explained to me what was really going on. These people thought it was funny to try to send me into a psychotic break when they knew I was ill and struggling. I really hope this isn't the case and I don't want to make you paranoid but I do believe you should cut these horrible people out of your life ASAP without any explanation. They don't deserve your friendship. I'm so proud of you for seeking help when you thought you were losing touch with reality but I'm so sorry that anyone would pull such an evil ""prank"" on you. Just so you know, this isn't a prank. It's straight up bullying. Even if they were your actual friends at one point, they obviously don't care enough about you to see that this was altering your mental state. I hope you find peace with this situation soon. Never feel bad for cutting people off that show they don't care for you. You're not the bad guy if you're trying to protect your health."
AmItheAsshole,fpxtngx,t3_gfx4nt,1588989343.0,NTA. I've gone to Suboxone doctors for years and have never experienced a nurse basically offering a hook up. This is disgusting to me. I'm not even the kind of person who believes in full sobriety or the program. She could seriously cause someone some serious problems if not basically kill them! Pls report asap.

Paranormal,fojgdiq,t1_fofn5w9,1587820140.0,A Ouija board is just a tool. It may seem that it's mostly bad but it's really not. I've been using them since I was a young teenager. I do proper opening and closing out the sessions tho.i don't recommend using them unless you're with someone who is experienced but if you find someone like that then you should give it a try! I can interact w spirit and other dimensional beings but it really wears on me so I try not to. I don't look at myself as a medium tho.

Paranormal,fof54eb,t1_fo9ma5l,1587726360.0,I have a whole life long of experiences but this just reminded me of a few in particular that were really difficult for me
AmItheAsshole,fof52o2,t1_foa21h0,1587726312.0,"I'm so very sorry to hear that. I can definitely relate. My whole life has been fucked around by CPS as I was in the system. Then if course when I had a kid they tried to take him. I lucked out w my SO's family as they are great people who would never keep me away from my son. Of course now it's just my husband, my son and me and I hope to keep it that way. If they ever come to my door again I won't answer. Fuck them."
AskReddit,fof4wi5,t1_fof4r7s,1587726137.0,"I can't speak for everyone, only myself. I'm not very easily offended. In general, intention means everything to me and even though I'm extremely mentally ill I'm still capable of objective thought so as long as it wasn't meant to harm then I don't see the problem."
Paranormal,fof4r9d,t1_foevs5d,1587725990.0,Wow that's all amazing. I've experienced seeing many different things during sleep paralysis but I've seen and had actually interactions that were much more scary completely awake. I'd rather see a shadow man at the end of my bed for a few seconds before I shut my eyes then have actual conversations and scratches on my body. I wonder if your mom is the one rocking the chair? What do you think?
AskReddit,fof49iq,t1_fof1vgx,1587725485.0,Generally no but I could tell the intention wasn't bad so it doesn't bother me in this threadðŸ˜Š
AskReddit,fof3ydf,t1_fof1osp,1587725165.0,"As someone who has multiple clinical mental health diagnosis', my OCD is the hardest to live with especially mixed with PTSD. People don't really understand OCD. I call it ""the call of the void"". My mind is so full of terrifying imagery that's it's almost impossible to function most of the time."
AskReddit,fof2uci,t1_fof083v,1587724010.0,I'm not completely sure this relates to what you're talking about but I think it does. I had a TBI 7 years ago on the left side of my brain. I had to have emergency brain surgery. A started losing function in the right side of my body. It's only gotten worse since having a couple mini strokes from another issue. I just stopped walking w a cane less than a year ago with lots of hard work. Apparently this is more common than people realize

Paranormal,fo9e9v3,t3_g5ydft,1587617146.0,The way you described what you saw almost made me start crying. It gave me goosebumps. I've seen something very similar

AmItheAsshole,fo8m9xd,t1_fo8l866,1587599342.0,CPS ruins lives. I completely agree w your sentiment about getting mad when people suggest it. It's almost never the right answer I promise. People get pretty mad when they hear my opinion on this also. I think if they had ever personally dealt w CPS before then they would agree w me.
AmItheAsshole,fo65zi0,t3_g5vmwd,1587547785.0,YTA. CPS can absolutely destroy lives and families. You would really call over something so petty?

Now I've smoked DMT many many times and taken countless other psychs but this has only happened to me one time and I can't explain how helpful it was for me.

AmItheAsshole,fmm2t3y,t3_fvzeec,1586197733.0,YTA. You are completely out of touch w reality. It's actually hard for me to believe that I'm not being trolled reading this post. I think the worst part is that you don't even feel bad that you stole his laptop and let something happen to it. You're just looking for ways to get out of it and putting the blame elsewhere.

u_ASavageLost,etfjlvl,t3_cbazwv,1562771155.0,My constructive criticism of the last handful of chapters is that you should stretch out leticia's story a bit more. I know this is fiction and there are people that get addicted that fast but I think it would help flow much better if you went into exactly how it started and how it progressed more than you have. I feel like her character is extremely important to this story and I think she deserves more time and background for the audience to truly grasp her character. You know I love you're writing and can't wait for the next! I usually wait until you've posted atleast 5 or 6 more chapters before I do more reading so I hope you have some up soon.
