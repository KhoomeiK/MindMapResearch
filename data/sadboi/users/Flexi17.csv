AskReddit,fkxlxjq,t3_fl944n,1584630888.0,My brother was baptized by a priest who was accused of child molestation. The parish protected him and he got moved to another church instead of facing justice. My mom had a framed photo in our house of my little brother being baptized by that priest. She threw it out when the allegations came to light.

AskReddit,fji2d64,t3_fdi1uz,1583359440.0,"Pay someone to completely immerse me in the world of Harry Potter (building a perfect replica of hogwarts,etc.) and hiring full time actors to play all the characters. Create IRL special effects to make me feel like I‚Äôm casting spells. Follow the plot of the books. It‚Äôll take seven years."
BPD,fix8okf,t3_facb03,1582815260.0,"Hi there. I‚Äôm on a long slow process of quitting Zoloft. Each time I step down a dose I have a few weeks of feeling numb, dizzy, irritable, depressed, etc. However, after those few weeks I feel much better as my mood thankfully stabilized. I‚Äôm hoping to eventually come all the way down but it is really tough. I was on 150 mg and I‚Äôm down to 100 mg after a year. 

Remember everyone has a different experience depending on dose, diagnosis, metabolism, etc. NEVER try to quit these medications cold turkey or without the supervision of your doctor. 

Not trying to be judgmental at all but you should probably stop taking recreational drugs while you‚Äôre going through this process. It‚Äôs gonna make it that much harder for you. All the best !!"

AskReddit,ezmt2bs,t3_c69rwg,1567996622.0,"Acknowledge that they‚Äôve been vulnerable with you and let them know you appreciate that they trust you enough to share. Speaking from personal experience, telling others you have depression can be uncomfortable, awkward, and scary. I had a friend do this once and it made me feel super safe and comfortable. Sounds small but it goes a long way."

genetics,ewzucp2,t1_ewzav2w,1565900870.0,"Your test results will not be able to determine this. The only way to determine this is if your father‚Äôs uncle had genetic testing. 

In addition it might be difficult for you if you don‚Äôt have any genetic testing results handy from an affected relative. Lots of things can look like HD, so the only way to truly confirm a diagnosis is with genetic testing and/or neurologist eval of an affected person. 

Good luck!"

running,evgmqbv,t1_evgjorn,1564512636.0,"My marathon training consisted of one long run per week gradually stepping it up over a few months (but I never ran more than 20) plus two speed training work outs a week (fartleks, hills, etc.). I actually ran my personal best half during training season for the full... about halfway through the training. I cross trained on ""rest days"" because I have a hip flexor/knee issue that flairs up if I run much more than 3x/week."
