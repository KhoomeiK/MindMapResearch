>I doubt this will be seen, but whatever it needs to be mentioned.

First let me preface this by saying I originally started this cycle as a Warren supporter. However Bernie was a strong second (he remains the only candidate I've ever donated to).

Now I'm hoping someone has strong argument against this , but I think there's a case to vote Bloomberg. Assuming he receives the nomination (God forbid). ""Vote blue no matter who"" still matters. He is most definitely the lesser of two evils. 

First let's take a look at Al Franken. He was held accountable for what I consider a minor thing. Now take a look at Trump, he has a cult following that will screech ""fake news"" at anything against their dear leader. Bloomberg doesn't have that. 

Going with this logic of Trump's cult they'd be beyond pissed if he lost. This same cult is scaring republicans to fall in line (see Lindsay Graham, or Cruz). Again Bloomberg doesn't have this following. 

Finally, I believe that Bloomberg wouldn't be able to do a single perctange of what trumps done without being impeached. All republicans would want to preserve what's left of the cult, and at least a handful of Democrats would listen to evidence.

So - who's more dangerous? Trump with a cult following, or Bloomberg who could be dropped at any moment?"
