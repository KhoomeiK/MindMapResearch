—————————————————————————

I’ve ran this glitch a few times, and have constantly wondered why it hasn’t been patched. It’s been out for YEARS. Why is it so hard to prevent people from leaving? Here’s the things that I think they could do:

• Make the heist start saving as “completed” earlier, maybe as the avenger flies above the LSIA airstrip.

• Change the heist completely. Remove the heist, altogether, and change it. If people are making 10s of millions from this, and rockstar is so dedicated to ensuring fair play and removing glitches, why is this not an option?

• Last but not least, I am almost positive this is the best possible option: Gta can detect when a player leaves an event/job in progress, we know this because of the “bad sport!” warnings and such. How can they not tell if you have left act II? How can the game not tell the difference between leaving a specific heist? And why not install something that results in automatic advancement to Act III after 5 times of quitting Act II? (after 5 leavings because shit happens, those who aren’t glitching might leave by accident due to wifi, having to get off, etc)"

AskReddit,fjyjq82,t3_ffi3uw,1583698231.0,"I (16m) am on an SSRI, a type of antidepressant and causes some sleep-related side effects. The one that I have the privilege of experiencing is sleep paralysis. 

And, contrary to popular belief, it’s not that bad.
You get that feeling of disorientation as you come out of a dream, and go to roll over or get up. But when you go to move, nothing happens. Everything is numb and still. You can slightly bend your fingers, move your eyes, kinda move your ab muscles. The only thing you have full control over is breathing and eye movement. The best way to get out of it is to hyperventilate, in my opinion.

My first experience was scary, but I knew what it was, because I had experienced similar things in a dream, where I try to scream or wake myself up and nothing happens. It felt like that with my eyes open. So I just tried to squirm out of it and eventually did. No hallucinations, nothing. Just the inability to move for a few seconds. 

The only time I hallucinated is when I had sleep paralysis while looking at the ceiling. There were faces, people in baseball caps talking nonsense. I came out of it and that was it. No demon, no screaming. Kinda like a mini dream with my eyes open. 

If sleep paralysis is something you have anxiety over, don’t worry. It’s a little scary the first time, but after a few experiences you’ll learn to keep your eyes closed and wait for it to be over. Hope this helps!"
