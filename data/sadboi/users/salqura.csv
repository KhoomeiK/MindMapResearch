cripplingalcoholism,fpj7acx,t1_fpj75xp,1588658710.0,I know it’s the best option as I’m sure we all do. I had to leave school and started really heavily drinking when I was 18. I’ve gained 100 lbs since then so I don’t know about the beer. Sometimes I’m so confident because I feel good when I stay sober but then I fall back into it after a week or so
twentyonepilots,fpj5gkr,t1_fpicdrr,1588657156.0,"So many religious undertones in a lot of their music. I did a lot of research back in high school on the Bible and their music and his interviews when I was taking adderall. I’m pretty sure he’s sharing the message of the Bible discretely and he doesn’t want to push it on anyone and they’re only good messages not controversial really (please use discretion when you’re messing with the message, man). I also could be 100% wrong about that last part because that’s just my assumption but, yeah lots of religious connections. Okay sorry the end."
