With that knowledge I know that humans do crazy things when pushed, we do desperate acts to make up for lost stuff. You may see a bad guy robbing a store. I see a human being pushed by a society that has regularly failed him and now is shot dead. I don't think he's a bad guy, I don't even know him. I only saw him do one thing, and that whole video is out of context."
