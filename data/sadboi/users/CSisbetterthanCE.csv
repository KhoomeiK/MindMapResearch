a) you’re confident and comfortable, preferably somewhere you’ve been before,  
b) you enjoy yourself (this is important, if you have a good time you will show her a good time) and  
c) somewhere you can eat or drink or can leave and go have food after.  

   
My personal choice is a comedy club, I love stand up comedy and not many girls have been to live stand up shows before, it’s light hearted and you can talk in between sets, you can have a lil drink as you watch and then go have dinner (if you like her).  
  

Don’t go somewhere too expensive or somewhere where you have to make a time commitment and can’t leave if it’s not going well, also never movie or mall dates (they’re lazy and uninspired, you want to stand out).  

Ultimately try to have a good time while getting to know your date better. Think of it as going out to have fun not an interview for a potential partner."

I get there and she tells me that she has to leave in 40 minutes because her dad is coming to pick her up (she's 19, I'm 20). All we could do was eat McDonald's in the food court in the station. It was packed and noisy and we could hardly make conversation.

I would have chalked it up to unfortunate circumstances and asked her out again but I saw how immature she was - she was wearing big ugly winter boots, she had her school bag with her, cancelling last minute, her dad coming to pick her up - so I didn't."

I just feel like whenever I give a 100% of myself to someone, two things happen. A) I become vulnerable to being hurt if they leave, and B) they leave. At least, this has been my experience so far. And I don't want anyone to be able to hurt me like that any more. I never want to like someone more than they like me.

Staying friends with a girl you *obviously* have feelings for, romantic and sexual, while she doesn't, isn't a great idea. You can't 'stay friends' because you never were friends. You were romantic interests, potential partners, not friends (unless, of course, you two were friends before you started going out).

And staying friends in hopes of getting with her is garbage advice. Don't be friends with people you want to fuck. Don't have ulterior motives or hopes of getting with her. If you truly do value her friendship, and she does yours, forget the thought of being with her again. Don't stick around in case she changes her mind - your time, energy and affection should be worth more than that."

dating,f39vsx2,t3_dfpoo7,1570756682.0,"Hey. As a guy with social anxiety that's been *really* bad in the past, I'd suggest you don't give up on her. Maybe it's because I wish people wouldn't give up on me and I can relate to her. Usually I've had people not even try a second time and then it feels even worse, and you hate yourself for not even trying. I relate to the audio/video call part as well.

Anywho, that's just some insight into how she might be feeling. Practically, I would talk to her - ask her what scenario she feels most comfortable in. Let her suggest an idea and a date, and let her know that you understand her anxieties and that she can feel safe with you. Also, maybe sending audio snippets instead of a call and selfies instead of a video chat might help. Also let her know that she's more than her appearance and you like her for *her,* and not just her looks.

Of course, all this is assuming she's honest about her social anxiety and bdd and not a catfish or something like that.

Also, like I said, my advice is biased and coming from a guy who's faced social anxiety and bdd. Best of luck!"
