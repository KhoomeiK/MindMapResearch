She spent about 10 minutes on everyone, but about 3 minutes on me. And to be honest, I feel too defeated at this point. In general, she’s a very unsettling person to talk to- even at the start of the semester. I’m not sure what it is. It feels like she’s uncomfortable engaging.

EMDR,fiksoue,t1_fikd4oc,1582486549.0,"Yeah, I held the buzzers in my hand that alternated, and I would close my eyes. There were 2 horses, and we mainly just watched them. As a client, you’re not allowed to ride them, so it was just grooming and watching. They’re amazing creatures, and they really do pick up on how you’re feeling- even if you’re not aware, and they’ll start acting it out. Me personally, I got a lot out of watching them interact. And my therapist would ask what I think is going on/what it looks like to me. Like if it looked like one was pissed, she would ask what I saw/assumed that made me think that. And grooming was wicked grounding and tactile. 

My coolest story happened like 8ish months in. I was attacked by a friend’s dog about 2 years prior, and it bit my face. And for the longest time, I was terrified of dogs. I was walking one of the horses, and she bit me (even the therapist said she showed no signs beforehand). I kept walking and then just started sobbing. But after that, I’ve been even more obsessed with dogs than I was before. It was a pittie, and I moved in after with a friend who had a 90 lb pit, and she would sleep in bed with me and I felt so safe. It was so cool. I didn’t react in the moment with the dog bite, so it felt like I processed the dog bite after the horse bite.

So I hate saying it out loud because I feel guilty, but it’s always like a knight-in-shining-armor theme. Since I was little, it was always that I was in trouble. Since high school, there was always a sexual component. It gets really extreme. Sometimes it’s like different “versions” of my past, but not always. And the “knight” is a guy that I have a crush on or used to or a boyfriend if I’m dating. But it’s like two separate characters. In my head, I’m a “prettier” version of me, and I separate the guy IRL and dream version of him. But they save me, we fall in love, all that cheesy jazz. I know why I use that theme, I get the psychology and connection to my neglect and abuse. I know it’s to help self soothe and provide myself care/comfort/attention that I didn’t receive as growing up. I’ve just kinda acknowledged and accepted it.

service_dogs,fe09pqq,t1_fdw2cqb,1578807051.0,"Thank you! The public is what makes me nervous. I start to dissociate and just recently discovered that I have emotional flashbacks. If you don’t mind me asking, do confrontation/conflict happen often?"
service_dogs,fe09ca7,t1_fdyxiok,1578806711.0,"I never thought about it from that perspective, damn. Thank you, I needed that"
service_dogs,fe099oj,t1_fdwy30t,1578806646.0,"That’s honestly been one of the biggest things holding me back. The stories I’ve read/heard about dealing with the public just leave me speechless. And I’m angry that people’s ignorance and entitlement are a huge part of me doing something that I know will help improve my life. It’s just not fair, and it sucks

But thank you for this"
service_dogs,fe08z30,t1_fdyx297,1578806381.0,"Oh my god, I’m so incredibly sorry. That’s beyond horrific. I’m so proud of you for going back out. It’s so hard. Thank you for sharing with me"
ptsd,fdxqvqo,t3_enbnf0,1578771995.0,"I’m the same way 100% even when I know I’m safe. My friend and I just recently talked about how we both like each other, and he was the most compassionate guy when it came to my triggers. But sometimes just cuddling would send me straight to the bathroom and puking and hyperventilating. I wish I had something to help, some tips or shortcuts. You’re not alone though. I don’t know what it’s called or how to work on it, and it sucks. Keep your head up though ❤️"
service_dogs,fdvpho3,t3_en7c81,1578750077.0,Thank you for this ❤️
CPTSD,fdn96fx,t3_em1f5p,1578580613.0,"I’ve had IBS since middle school. I’ve had an endoscopy and colonoscopy in high school and nothing was found. It took me close to a decade to realize it was tied to trauma. Whenever I get emotional flashbacks or anxiety attacks. I’m so fucking sick of it and tired of it. It can get so inconvenient and I’m working so hard on not being mortified. People think I’m not staying on top of it because I don’t take meds. I tried every med (culturelle, probiotics, etc), and it doesn’t work. It’s so tiring. Keep fighting even though the fight wasn’t your fault. I’m sending you healthy tummy and body vibes!"
service_dogs,fdkxhxn,t1_fdkoaxg,1578513187.0,"If this comes across rude or offensive or personal, I’m so incredibly sorry- do you regret getting a SD? I’m just curious and I’ve been considering a SD for CPTSD for a few years. My therapist and I talked about moving forward. The people are honestly the biggest reason I’ve been apprehensive"
Dogtraining,fde5bgh,t1_fde2l7u,1578331509.0,"Oh not the whole time, it’s so important for them to take a break so there’s no overstimulation. But I know A few daycares around where I worked that were designated daycares but would just keep them in crates. It wasn’t a boarding place but they treated it as such. Sorry, most of where I am say “crate free” and it implies that they’re just not kept isolated."
tattoos,fddox5a,t3_eksdzk,1578319953.0,They have to bandage the tattoo to keep in clean the first few hours (sometimes the first day). Don’t jump to conclusions
Dogtraining,fddor3f,t3_ektmsu,1578319809.0,"Crate free places for sure. I was a manager of a puppy daycare. It’s inhumane that some places define doggie daycare as keeping them in crates for 6+ hours only letting them out to go to the bathroom. Smaller number of dogs (usually) means more one on one time and attention dogs are getting. Look for attentive staff who honestly put the dogs first before anything. Most places won’t give a tour, but definitely ask anyways"
ptsd,fdcuocz,t3_ekhnbj,1578284821.0,Sending air hugs ❤️ I swear one of the hardest feelings is just wanted to be held or want a hug and having no one.
CPTSD,fdcma6r,t1_fdcm0g1,1578278435.0,"We’ve started that recently. I’ve just sat down cross legged for a few moments, and I’ve held out my hand- not to touch her, just holding my hand out. I’ve talked a lot to her and wrote letters. I’m home on break and I tuck in my stuffed animals every night. I’ve held onto a stuffie that I’ve had all through living with my abuser who was like my safety/comfort object, and I sleep with him every night. The biggest thing I’ve done is just reassuring her whenever I think of her"
CPTSD,fdclf1f,t1_fdckoy4,1578277812.0,"The first one I kinda recognized didn’t feel like me was one I had named Vixen (long before I brought her up in therapy”.  She’s the one that “takes over” during sex, every time even if it’s 100% consensual with a partner. But she tells me what face/noise to make, and she reminds me of Jessica Rabbit (if you know that cartoon). The second one I started calling Little One. She’s terrified and always hiding in this shadow. I can feel that she’s just wrapped in this huge blanket and she doesn’t want anyone to see her. I’ve noticed sometimes when I’m with a partner, I fall back into these extremely childlike behaviors (none of which are bad, I think like the fawn reaction?).  It’s hard to describe"
CPTSD,fdckrrf,t1_fdckoy4,1578277352.0,"I have no idea, he’s the most recent (like literally this past week) one I’ve talked to my therapist about."
CPTSD,fdck0cz,t1_fdci8p1,1578276807.0,"It’s like seeing a hologram. He’s like a layer in between my eyes and the “real world”. I’ve been trying to describe it since I was little. My eyes are open and I’m awake, and I can see him, but I know he’s not there- like if I reached out, I couldn’t feel him. Like how you can have a sticker on your window-it’s on one surface of your vision, but it’s not in all layers. I don’t know if any of that makes any sense... he’s not a hallucination, I know he can’t touch or hurt me. He usually doesn’t move. I see him for like a split second, but he’s so scary and terrifying I push back and make myself think of something else"
