I adopted him a year ago and for the first time I have captivated his attention. No toy, cat nip, or game has brought so much entertainment to this cats life as this has. Every morning he waits by the door so I can open the blinds. When the first round of birds come (a couple of house finches, Bob and Linda) he gets in a certain position and his cheeks tremble, he makes some weird clicking noises too. His excitement winds down through out the day, but opening those windows is his greatest daily joy."

AskReddit,fin1iab,t3_f8ns1x,1582553413.0,"About a year ago I was sitting in the living room watching tv with my dog. My husband was sitting in another room doing work. We live in a fifteenth floor overlooking a highway. Around 9:30 pm my dog starting acting really weird, I’ve never seen her act like this. Her ears were pulled back and she wouldn’t stop looking at the corner where the balcony is. She kept showing her teeth but then she would cry. I opened the balcony door to see if there was something out there but it wasn’t. She freaked out even more when I opened the door. I asked my husband to come look at our dogs behavior and he got weirded out by it too. She would start crying and showing teeth enero time we walked towards that corner and refused to come near it. 
I felt a presence and motive weird movements around that area but thought it was my subconscious acting up due to my dogs behavior. 
The next day, my Neighbor asked me if I had felt anything weird the night before, she said she had seen a shadow before she went to bed. 
I almost cried... I explained what had happened with my dog the night before and she flipped her shit. 
That same day we doing out that the night before around 9:25 there was an accident on the highway we overlook and a teenager had died.

AustralianShepherd,fia9tah,t3_f6x5po,1582296462.0,"Aussies are amazing, loving, loyal, energetic and smart puppies. You must put time and effort in training them and exercising them. 
My partner took off almost a full month off work to be able to train our Aussie. I understand that most people don’t have that freedom, but putting in 30 min a day to train and 30 (hopefully more) to exercise goes a long way. 
Buy several rope toys, mine loved them as a puppy and still does, and if you see your pup biting anything, that he/she shouldn’t be biting, immediately take it away and give the rope toy. Mine never destroyed anything or bite anything that she shouldn’t because is this trick. 
Keep lots of treats around and always reward good behavior, with treats and verbally. 
A beginners obedience class was very helpful as well. 
Enjoy your pup!!! Having an Aussie is one of the greatest things in life. Mine is my sunshine and best friend. 
Remember that with Aussies mental stimuli is as important as physical exercise."
