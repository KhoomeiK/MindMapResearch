1. If a threat is at your house, you have to wait for the police to show up. Whether the person is armed with a firearm or not, a firearm in your hands serves to give you an advantage, or equal footing. We could pull every gun ever from everyone here, and the criminals would have a field day bc they won't turn theirs' in. Its cliche, but its true- when seconds count, the police are minutes away.
2. Persons of color are wary of the police, and I can't say I blame them. I won't go as far to say all cops are evil, but I'm also not naive enough to say that the police are free from corruption, racism, and/or bias. A POC is less likely to call the police in this situation. They need to be able to protect themselves."
