Either way, I wish you luck on dealing with the shitty cards life has dealt. Stay strong if you still have the energy to do so. If not, when you are facing weakness, remember that life may give you opportunities or chances to alter your life. Taking those chances are some of the scarriest and hardest choices one can make, but good can come out of it. Even if you can't tell if changing will lead for the better, sometimes change in and of itself is what is necessary. -u/ApeBog"
SuicideWatch,febsblo,t3_eo9o49,1578962136.0,"Your RWBY dolls still need you to help fight back against Salem and the Grimm! Don't go! Being 13 years old is tough (at least it was for me). All your thoughts, feelings, emotions-they are all valid. No one has the authority to tell you how you should feel or think. I haven't called a hotline for the same reason as you. Its scary. And you are right, mental hospitals are awful. Opening up about our feelings is hard to do nowadays with how society is. But I promise you aren't alone. You sharing this post with this community of people is extremely brave. I haven't gone through what you have. Nobody else in the world has. That doesn't mean we don't care. Even if the only people you can talk to are a bunch of random usernames on this website, remember that each one is another real person. Try imagining a face for every person that has replied to you. That is how many faces care about you and what you are going through. We don't know what you've had to deal with, but we care about you anyways. If you want, I would totally chat about RWBY with you. Also, I have four cats; Ernie, Coal, Kali, Leo, and they say hi to Binxy!

depression,fbf1bx6,t3_eczhm3,1576799019.0,"I think it is important to note that the Christmas your brother speaks of you 'ruining' is his or your family's Christmas. You have no obligation to sacrifice your own happiness for the sake of the 'family'. 

Making a decision seems hard here, as you are seemingly forced to make a sacrifice. What I will say is that making a decision based on inner convictions is more liberating. Making the choice to visit your friend would be following what you truly believe to be right. The obvious complication is the family ostracization. Yes visiting your friend may put you at a worse situation objectively (perhaps losing financial resource, as I do not know your situation, just making an example). However, although from the outside it may seem like you put yourself worse off, from the inside, you will be able to wake up the next day knowing that you started to live as yourself. You never chose your family, you just have been put there by fate. Choosing who you want to have meaningful connections with will start to craft the family you want to participate in. Not the biological family, but the web of relationships with people that are better off knowing you, and you better off knowing them.

This isn't even mentioning what it would mean for your friend if you visited, but I am sure you have that figured out by now. Your family doesn't seem to get that by you visiting your friend, it would mean they had raised someone that helps someone in need. If that isn't something they value, then it may be best to make some more hard choices. I hope the situation becomes a little easier for you, best of luck."
