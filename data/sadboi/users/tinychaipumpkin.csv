Yea I had no pad in my bag so I was like crap and stuffed my undies with tissue paper and I was like hey I may need you to go to Walmart to get me some pads because unfortunately I forgot to bring one.

I was assigned my own patient but we're partnered up but I was like you know what you guys I think I'll be fine on my own. It wasnt as bad as I made it seem. We did vital signs, checked blood glucoses and worked on our head to toe the first day. The rest of the days we did about the same and passed meds to multiple patients, answered call lights, did care plans, researched meds. My instructor made sure that everyone had an opportunity to give the same amount of meds and to give both insulin and enoxaparin. I only gave one bath bed with three other classmates while my clinicals. I also found out that for some reason I preferred male patients. Like another Reddit peep said make sure to eat breakfast before going. Good luck!"
