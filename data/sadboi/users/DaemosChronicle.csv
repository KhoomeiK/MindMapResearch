Sekiro,fq19ljx,t3_ggb3vc,1589043549.0,"Try to stay behind him and avoid his feet and the fire claw combo.

When he jumps high up, try to get some space and jump as he's about to land to avoid the shockwave and grapple onto him.

Whenever he does the perilous attack charge rush, just jump (and to the side if you can). Most of the time, simply jumping will avoid it altogether.

You can deflect the chunks of rock he throws at you. I just bait him and try to avoid those. Too much damage if you mess up the deflection.

Second and third phase are more of the same with two new perilous attacks. The first new one he'll do at the beginning of his second phase, so you get a clear view of the signs to look for. He looks like he's about to stomp, but then he hops and swings his arm around full force to slam the ground and send a wave of fire at you. You wanna run and then jump to the side at the last second. Timing on that one is a quick death.

His other perilous attack comes out in third phase. He extends his arms and swings them around his torso. If you're close, just spam jump.

The Mortal Blade does some solid damage.

Use the whistle prosthetic to stun him. Only works 3x. Honestly never got it to work and used emblems on the blade."
