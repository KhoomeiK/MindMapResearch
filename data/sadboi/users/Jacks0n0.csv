People don‚Äôt rid themselves of homosexuality.. not sure what you‚Äôre citing lol.

Love how you left out the medication aspect and simply exaggerated the religious freaks sentence. There is no therapy. There is no medication. Because it doesn‚Äôt work. You can‚Äôt convert yourself from straight to gay and you can‚Äôt convert yourself from gay to straight.

Also ‚Äúexpect the rest of society to put up with it‚Äù. Sorry it‚Äôs so difficult for you to put up with another sexuality. We‚Äôll try to suppress it the next time we are around you for your convenience. And thank you SO much for working to try and convert homosexuals, I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs gonna work out GREAT. Sure as hell has worked in the past lol!"
theCalaisPlan,fkbaexa,t1_fkajn0g,1584029289.0,"The sociopolitical pressure was from the label, not the evidence backing it. The evidence clearly reflects a completely different sexuality rather than a mental disorder. In the DSM it was listed as ‚ÄùSexual Orientation Disturbance‚Äù. If it were just an act or a mental disorder it‚Äôd be something an individual could work on and rid themselves of. But scientists have run many tests, religious freaks have run many conversion camps and none of it has worked! That's why the definition has been changed, people born in the 70/80s were still working on understanding sexuality for what it is. 

But if you‚Äôre going to continue to be homophobic because the gays make you uncomfortable, then you better be in for the long haul because society is finally beginning to integrate homosexuality as just another sexuality. Not a mental disorder."
