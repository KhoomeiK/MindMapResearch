UnresolvedMysteries,fqs8638,t3_gk1de9,1589600700.0,"I honestly want to curse you out but I'm not going to.
Shauna Rae was my favorite youtuber. Shes been citing her sources for her videos and always talks about and focuses on the victims in these cases. She only had about 85,000 followers and was working on building her channel. She has spoken about what a rough year it's been and it's just been terrible for her. 

Then you go and accuse her of something she didn't do. Yeah you messaged her directly and got it solved, but before you did that you accused her of plagiarism so that your fans could go and harass her. She was already in a bad mental state because of everything she's been through, and instead of waiting to actually check to see if it was your material she was plagariszing, you just blasted her on your page. 

The fact is that you both used the same sources because there arent a lot of sources on this case. She used her own words to talk about the case. When two people talk about the same case, there's going to be some overlap because guess what? You're both talking about facts! These aren't think pieces where you come up with original ideas. These are fucking TRUE CRIME cases. Plenty of YouTubers cover the same cases with the same information just because their followers want to hear about these cases or to spread awareness. But instead of being happy that someone else cared about a case that you cared about, you were butt hurt that somebody had the bright idea to get sponsers for their channel and actually make money off their research. And yes, she did her research, just like you did. 

I am absolutely disgusted by you and your followers for what you did. She made a whole video showing and citing her work and proving that it wasn't plagarized, apologized over and over again for the misunderstand, had to fucking delete her videos and hide her social media, and all you have to say in return is this half assed ""apology""??? You say that things were resolved as if there was an issue to begin with. Maybe you should've done your own research before putting this woman on blast. You need to be more clear here with the people that follow you so they understand the situation: there was nothing to be resolved because she didn't steal your work! You both used the same sources! Just like how thousands of high school students can write papers on To Kill a Mockingbird and use the same quotes because it's the same book. You should be groveling and begging for forgiveness because what you've done is so beyond disrespectful, it is truly terrible."
TrueCrime,fqs62r9,t3_gknbeu,1589599346.0,I am beyond upset. She was my favorite YouTuber and she seems like such a beautiful person. I hope she comes back from all of this or at least puts her videos back up.

AskReddit,fopk96p,t3_g8p21v,1587963724.0,"So the first week of high school always had ""Freshman Friday"" which consisted of (normally harmless) pranks on the freshman class. One year when I was a junior, some of the seniors were taking tea bags, wetting them, and throwing them on freshmen in the hallways, calling it ""tea bagging"" (which they new had a much worse meaning to it). My principal was an old, gentle man who wasn't really in touch with new phrases or sayings. He interrupted fourth period by going on the intercoms that were in each class room telling the seniors to ""Stop tea bagging the freshmen."" Poor guy didn't know what he was saying."

If it's a good place and you have the right mindset, it's like a mini vacation for your mind. I would do research on mental hospitals in your area because I have had a bad inpatient experience. It wasn't terrible, but it wasn't good either."
BPD,fo9hgm7,t3_g68t0s,1587619646.0,"Back in 2018, I was feeling very suicidal after a break up. It happened very suddenly and I was breaking down hard. My parents hid my pills from me as soon as the break up happened because I said that I wanted to die. My mom asked me if I wanted to go to the hospital and I said yes. The hospital I went to had two separate wings: one was for depressives and addicts and the other was more for people having psychotic breaks or hallucinations. I went into the less ""intense"" ward. I was mostly surrounded by recovering addicts waiting to be transfered to a more long term rehab, but there were a couple of depressives in my wing. I have BPD and bipolar type 2, so I couldnt really relate to anyone. I actually quite enjoyed my stay. I got to see my doctor every day, they gave me meds to help me sleep, I got to sleep as much as I wanted to, we had movie night every night, they had a few books to choose from (though I brought my own), and they even had a few art supplies that I had access to all day. Once I was anxious and couldn't sleep even though it was bed time, but the night nurses let me go to the common area and draw and write for a bit to calm my mind down. I stayed for about a week. I really needed it to calm down and get to a space in my head so that I wasn't a danger to myself. I was always honest with the doctors when I felt suicidal. Oh also you could call people whenever you wanted on their phones that hung on the walls. You could also refuse to take phone calls and only put certain people on a call list. The nurses were nice and I enjoyed talking to some of the other people there. My roommate was quiet. Overall a good experience."
bipolar2,fncjp5t,t1_fncgmup,1586838487.0,"From the research I've done, that is typically true with NPD but not necessarily BPD. I have BPD and when I read the section of the DSM V about BPD I was just blown away. I immediately accepted that it was who I was and went to seek out proper diagnosing through two different doctors by taking lengthy psych evaluations. Turns out my hunch was right and I was officially diagnosed with BPD by two different doctors."
bipolar2,fncjhbr,t3_g0slbd,1586838326.0,"I have bipolar 2 and BPD. I've used a combo of antidepressants, mood stabilizers, and DBT (dialectal behavior therapy) to work on healing. DBT was actually made for people with BPD, but it can help many different kinds of people. It can be expensive, but the treatment plan is about a year to a year and a half and is the only type of therapy that's ever worked for me. I'm a 26 year old female who was misdiagnosed from ages 14-22 with the general diagnosis of depression and anxiety. I was given SSRIs and put into CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy), which didn't work. I've tried about two dozen different meds since I was 14 and did 3 outpatient programs and 2 inpatient emergency related stays (I was 1013 with both inpatient stays). I highly recommend you try DBT if you think you have BPD. From what I understand (not a psychiatrist), mood stabilizer and antidepressants generally can help BPD, but the main source of help comes from DBT. Bipolar is the opposite: mood stabilizers are essential to take and therapy can be done on an as needed basis. However, if you feel like your meds aren't working for you, just keep trying new ones by asking for guidance from your doctor. I actually had a doctor run a test on my saliva which gives you a panel on which drugs you metabolize better. It really was helpful when it came to weeding out ones that most likely won't work for me. Don't give up on meds, even though it is very frustrating. I had to basically put my life on hold for about three years while I was working to find the right meds. It's so worth it in the end when you find that magical combo."
BPD,flzmvnq,t3_fs3fyo,1585627657.0,I completely understand how you feel. Same thing happened to me almost two years ago. Had to commit myself to a mental hospital. I'm wishing you the best. Things do get better
bipolar2,fkt0cad,t3_fjlb42,1584502789.0,I use a white noise machine to help me sleep. You can get one on Amazon. CBD hemp oil helps calm me down but doesn't like drug me to sleep. I heard that the Calm app has sleep stories but I've never tried one. Also try progressive muscle relaxation while laying in bed. Sometimes some calm music like Nora Jones helps get me sleepy. I hope you don't get sick :( it's really hard to prevent when you have to work with the public. Thank you for taking the right steps and quarantining yourself. You might be saving lives by doing this.

bipolar2,fkszr5g,t3_fjw73i,1584502353.0,"I know it's so easy to turn to drugs and alcohol when you're depressed, but those are depressants and will only make your depression worse in the long run. Plus it's not good for you to be smoking pot so young because it affects your developing brain. I'm sorry if I sound like a mom but I just worry about your health. I'm a 26 year old female who had bipolar symptoms starting around 14 but didn't get diagnosed until I was about 22. I saw in the comments that you've been on Latuda for a year now and since it's not working, you need to talk to your doctor about switching. It's very frustrating switching from medication to medication, but about a year ago (and over a dozen different drugs later), I finally found my perfect med combo. It makes a world of a difference. Things do even out a bit once you get out of your teen years and with added maturity the symptoms become easier to manage. I was also sexually assaulted as a teen and found that DBT therapy coupled with Prolonged Exposure therapy helped my PTSD tremendously and made the nightmares go away. It's not an easy card to be dealt by having this diagnosis, but you will eventually see a light at the end of the tunnel. Please keep yourself safe and call a hotline if there's really nobody you can talk to."

rapecounseling,exwplpo,t3_cuok3q,1566622863.0,"First of all, I'd like to say that I'm so sorry this happened to you. 
Something that's important to remember is that consent is an ongoing process. Which means that you may start the sexual encounter consensually, but if things escalate too much for you or you at anytime feel uncomfortable, you have the right to resend your consent and say no or stop. If the person doesn't listen and continues these sexual action, they are committing a sexual assault. 
I highly recommend that you seek treatment for your experience on a professional level. Go to a therapist or a group for sexual assault victims. Share your story and find out if you need any further treatment. Some people are able to move on from these experiences without getting PTSD, but others, myself included, need a form of therapy to help them through it. I bottled up my story for years and didnt talk to anybody about it and it ate me up inside. Then I did a form of therapy called Prolonged Exposure and it's done wonders for me.

bipolar,ex4wqlw,t1_ex2dta6,1566012360.0,Abilify had me so effed up I was sleeping like 18 hours a day and when I was awake I looked like I was on drugs. My eyes were droopy and my words slurred. I'm glad it worked for you though
bipolar,ex4wjld,t1_ex291s0,1566012253.0,I took the test and I was amazed with how accurate it was. So many drugs that didn't work on me in the past were in the red zone of the packet.
bipolar,ex4wfnh,t3_cr5jvy,1566012190.0,"I'm on this newer drug called Rexulti and it's actually been working for me. It's really expensive without insurance but I'm applying to the company for assistance because of my financial situation. Fun fact, you can do that for basically all drugs. Just fill out a form and have your doc fill it out too, send it into the company, and get free prescriptions."
crazyexgirlfriend,ex4vqz9,t3_crdup0,1566011820.0,"Awe welcome to the BPD family! I'm about to finish my therapy, which consists of DBT group and Prolonged Exposure, and it's been the only therapy that's ever helped me. CBT never did much of anything for me. When it comes to treatment, definitely check out DBT. It was made for us, literally! It can be more expensive, but I mean my family has literally shelled out thousands of dollars on other therapy in the past, so it's way worth it."

AskReddit,evuyii4,t3_cl9jrg,1564811143.0,"I was actually in the back of an ambulance once being transferred to a mental hospital after being put on suicide watch. It was an hour long trip to the nearest mental hospital and I was anxious and even vomit from the anxiety while I was strapped down. Then, the driver of the ambulance turned on the radio and ""Let it Be"" by John Lennon started playing. I'm not really a huge Lennon fan or anything, but the song is so beautiful and calming that my anxiety started fading and I just sunk in and listened to the lyrics. My breathing became slow and steady again and my nausea went away. In that moment, I knew that everything was going to be okay."

AskReddit,eu5wgtp,t1_eu5ankk,1563486921.0,Yeah I take it too and helps with the sleep paralysis but not the nightmares
AskReddit,eu3opj4,t1_eu2befw,1563420572.0,Seriously I have PTSD and used to be a heavy weed smoker. I slept through the night wonderfully almost every single night. Since I've stopped smoking I've experienced sleep paralysis and nightmares that kind of bleed into my awake time (kind of hard to explain but basically I feel the same terror that I felt in the dream when I'm awake and it's hard for me to distinguish what reality is). I honestly wanna move to a weed legal state just so I can get a good night's sleep.
AskReddit,ett4whx,t1_etsg7w1,1563164694.0,This part always makes me cry. I think back to all the love I thought I deserved and how fucked up it was. This movie and book is an absolute gem and always makes me cry yet feel good by the end of it

trees,eqlcqtk,t3_byp6tl,1560141870.0,"I like to watch Disney movies I liked as a kid, especially Peter Pan and Alice in Wonderland. I was cracking up at the crocodile and captain hook last time I watched Peter Pan stoned"
trees,eqlci2i,t3_byt1nl,1560141712.0,I watched Deadpool for the first time when I was high and I was crying and my chest hurt from laughing so hard. It was also quite overwhelming at times because I felt like constant jokes and gore were being thrown at my face. I literally took a deep breath when the credits rolled because it felt like I was on a comedic rollercoaster for two hours. It was an amazing experience
trees,eqlbup9,t1_eqkxjcx,1560141312.0,Popcorn is a great suggestion because it's a lot of munching for not that many calories. Get some cut up fruit like watermelon or some veggies that are easy to eat like celery and carrots with ranch. Trail mix is filling and has that sweet and salty satisfaction factor. I struggle with munchies so much too dude it feels like a gain five pounds after each binge. Good luck!
