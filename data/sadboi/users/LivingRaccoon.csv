Mastery of Death lets you come back from 0 HP as many times as you have ki points. Combine this with Touch of Death for the temporary HP, and Hour of Reaping which doesn't require any resources to use and you can pretty much outlast any opponent you go up against. That's not even taking into consideration Flurry of Blows and Stunning Strike to increase your damage output, or Diamond Soul and Evasion to increase your survivability even more. Add on a race that has good maneuverability or hardiness and you become basically impossible to down. You can even throw in one or two levels of Cleric or Druid so you have healing and a buff to concentrate on."

3d6,fh0g80w,t1_fh07ti5,1581203612.0,"While it may be true that Strength isn't a good save to target, the difference between Earthbind and knocking an enemy prone is that a prone creature can just get back up and fly on its turn again. Also there's not a lot of things that can knock a creature prone that *don't* target Strength. The important thing is keeping a creature with flight locked to the ground, so it can't use its movement to fly away out of reach.

Also I forgot to the mention, grappling/restraining a flying creature is a great way to not only down them but keep them from flying away again. While Earthbind does this with one spell only (meaning its a great thing to concentrate on as it only has the one save), you could also do this with Bigby's Hand, Entangle, Web, and Ensnaring Strike. Entangle and Ensnaring strike make no mention of requiring the target be on the ground, so I'd recommend those as they are both super low-level, even if they require Strength saves and Conc. as well. 

In all honesty the best way to do it is just give a party member with good Strength some way to fly or teleport (Paladin's can use Find Greater Steed for flying mounts, Druids can use Wild Shape + Enhance Ability), and just stay close to the creature and continue trying to grapple them. Although I'd still recommend Earthbind, which can be followed up with a grapple if you wanna switch to concentrating on something else after the creature is downed."
3d6,fgzz1pt,t3_f0wlh4,1581198988.0,"The 5th-level spell ""Control Winds"" in XGE lets you create a downdraft that knocks creatures prone. Also the 2nd-level XGE spell ""Earthbind"" is perfect for putting flying creatures on the ground, but it doesn't knock them prone. Sleep, Eyebite, and Symbol can all put creatures unconscious, which is another way to knock people prone in midair.

Honestly, I'd stick with just using Earthbind. It may not deal falling damage to the creature, but its perhaps the most effective way to ground flying enemies, due to its fairly straight-forward effects and low spell slot cost. But by all means, if you find a good time to use one of the other spells without wasting too much in terms of spell slot cost, I'd say go for it."

Honestly, Snufkin seems like a Scout Rogue to me. He doesn't seem like a spellcaster, but it fits the niche of him being a skilled traveler and survivalist. I'd pick the Outlander background for thematic reasons, which also give a musical instrument proficiency (Harmonica). I have no idea how big Snufkin or the Moomins are, but when comparing their sizes to things like the tigers or the Hobgoblin, I'm guessing they're all small sized. Forest Gnome or Lightfoot Halfling seems to work for race, but Human works just as well if you think they're medium sized.

UnearthedArcana,etmogil,t3_ccb60j,1562964649.0,"Overall, I really like this Pact Boon, and always get excited when I see new Pact Boons posted on this subreddit. However, there are a few things that bothered me that I'd like to point out.

**Pact of the Coin**

> You have received a coin from your patron.

You should specify what type of coin it is (gold, silver, copper) or make it clear that the player can choose what the coin looks like.

> You can summon the coin as a bonus action, causing it to teleport instantly to your hand. As long as it remains on the same plane of existence as you, you are aware of its location.

Can you summon the coin if it's not on the same plane of existence as you? If not, I would reword this to something like, ""As long as it remains on the same plane of existence as you, you are always aware of its exact location, and you can summon the coin as a bonus action, causing it to teleport instantly to your hand.""

> You can communicate telepathically with a creature holding it as long as it speaks one language and within 120 ft of you.

I really don't like this part. It oversteps on GOO warlock's Awakened Mind ability, even if the range is increased somewhat. I recommend dropping this part, making it an invocation, or changing it entirely. Also, it should be ""and *is* within 120 *feet* of you.""

> Additionally, if the coin is within 30ft of you, you can teleport to it.

As an action, bonus action, etc.? Also *feet* not *ft*. Don't abbreviate in a class ability description. 

> No matter where the coin is located, you always teleport with your hand on the coin. Even if it is someone's pocket or pack. If you would arrive in a place already occupied by an object or a creature, you are pushed to the closest open space, coin in hand. You take 1d6 of force damage for every 5ft this displaces you.

Funny! Although I would make this damage a flat number, such as 5. Also no need for *""of""* before the words *""force damage""*, and *feet* not *ft*.

> Once you teleport in this way, you cannot do so again until you complete a long rest.

It's probably fine as it is, but you could consider making this a short rest in order to match up with Warlock's spell slots.

**Quirks**

I like these! Nothing about this I would change.

**Price of Passage**

While I would consider it consistent in power to Warlock's other invocations, it still feels like a throwaway ability, a design problem many of Warlock's invocations struggle with. I would change this slightly by removing the need for a Warlock spell slot, and/or replacing it with a different spell with a similar flavor (I would recommend Animate Objects, Bigby's Hand, Creation, Leomund's Secret Chest, or Mordenkainen's Private Sanctum).

**Coin Flip**

This is obviously the most interesting part of this Pact Boon and will be taken by 99% of the players who have it, so I would consider making this the primary Pact ability and making the teleport ability an invocation. Otherwise, this desperately needs to be renamed to something more magical sounding, as ""Coin Flip"" is a very boring name.

> Before you roll, you may active this invocation. On your next die roll, all results 1-10 are considered a natural 1, and all results from 11-20 are considered a natural 20.

The wording of this is very strange and not something that would be seen in any of the 5e books. I would reword this as,

""Before you make an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, you can test the fates to alter the outcome. Treat a d20 roll of 10 or lower as 1, and a d20 roll of 11 or higher as a 20.""

> You can't use this feature again until you finish a short or long rest.

This ability is very powerful and would likely be used often, so I would make this a long rest instead of a short rest, or limit the ability to just attack rolls and ability checks, not saving throws. This is a very fun risk-to-reward feature and I can see this being the result of many memorable table moments.

**Devilish Gamble**

Consider that this makes the Coin Flip ability have no downsides, as a reroll of 1 on a roll you already failed has no consequences RAW except in very specific circumstances (certain monster saving throws), while getting a 50% chance to turn any failed roll into a 20 is huge. I would consider reworking this entirely or scrapping it and replacing it with something else, as this ability generally goes against the spirit of the Pact's ""take a gamble"" flavor as there is no risk involved and will be abused by players. 

**Sight of the Sightless**

I don't like this. I could see this creating arguments between DMs and players about what constitutes ""eyes"" or not (Do glasses, sketches made by the player, or glass eyes count? Do constructs count as objects? What if a coin has no face on it? Players and DMs WILL disagree on these things). Also it's unclear if the information is received all at once or if the player has to wait a full 24 hours to see what happened in its entirety, or if you use an action or bonus action.

Instead, I would replace this with the ability to see through your coin as if you were there from any distance away as an action, or replace this invocation with something else.

**FINAL THOUGHTS**

I think this Pact Boon is a great idea with a fun flavor that fits with the Warlock class, however your wording on some of the abilities should probably be changed, as I have stated above. What would be nice for this Pact is some kind of treasure or chance related abilities. Maybe adding a few at-will spell invocations, like Tenser's Floating Disk, Unseen Servant, Arcane Lock, or Locate Object would give this Pact a bit more style.

This is a fun and flavorful Pact Boon that needs a few alterations to become truly great. Make those few changes and I think this Pact is perfect. :)"

**Wizard, Acolyte** - Gnostic: Magic is just as much a part of the world as fire, water, earth, or wind. It's no surprise that a number of deities have claimed magic as their domain of interest. You studied the arcane arts at a church or religious school of a god or goddess of magic, and use your spells as a form of worship.

**Wizard, Charlatan** - Beguiler: You have used Enchantment magic to manipulate your way into high society, posing under a false identity such as a distant member of a noble family or a wealthy merchant with important ties. Regardless of the nature of your false identity, you get stolen respect and privilege from those who were unwise enough to trust you.

**Wizard, Criminal** - Left-Hand Path: Magic is an extremely dangerous tool that can be accessed by anyone with enough intelligence and patience, so it's no surprise that some governments would want to criminalize certain areas of study. You are a practitioner of these forbidden magics, such as necromancy, alchemical narcotics, or fiend conjuration. You studied your magic underground, away from the watchful eyes of the law, with the guidance of a secretive mentor.

**Wizard, Entertainer** - Stage Magician: You use your magical abilities to entertain an audience at performances, using flashy illusion and conjuration magic to tell stories or create dazzling light shows. You might work with talented Bards or a traveling circus to make the performances even more special.

**Wizard, Folk Hero** - Peasant Savant: While most of the rural peasantry is uneducated and illiterate, you separated yourself from your class position by teaching yourself to read at a young age, and learned to practice magic through borrowed old books and scrolls. You used your magical talents to help your family and neighbors on the farm. Your intellect has ensured you will be destined for a life greater than simple farming.

**Wizard, Guild Artisan** - Alchemist: As one of the easiest magical talents to learn, alchemy is usually the first thing a novice wizard learns to do. You distinguished yourself as a talented alchemist, and made money as a member of the Alchemist's Guild by selling your magical potions on the market.

**Wizard, Hermit** - Recluse: Magic is something that takes a long time to master; many aspiring Wizards spend much of that time alone, hunched over spellbooks lit only by the light of a candle. You retreated to a solitary location to study magic, such as an abandoned library, quiet forest, or mountaintop retreat. You may have entered seclusion with a more talented mentor, who taught you the fundamentals of wizardry.

**Wizard, Noble** - Boarding School: It is common practice for noble families to hire the most intelligent teachers to raise their children, so that one day they may grow up to be wise leaders. You were sent to a school of the magical arts when you were young by your wealthy family, who saw knowledge of spellcraft as an essential thing for a child to learn.

**Wizard, Outlander** - Shaman: You come from a tribe far away from the civilized world, that honors the natural world through sacrifices and rituals. Your understanding of magic aided your tribe greatly.

**Wizard, Sage** - Mage: You spent years studying arcana to learn how to cast spells. You may have attended a school to learn magic, studied under the instruction of a wise master, or simply taught yourself by going to the library or conducting your own research. No matter how you learned, you learned the way most wizards gained their knowledge: through study.

**Wizard, Sailor** - Powder Mage: Not every warship uses cannons or archers to attack enemy battleships. You served on a warship as a powder mage, flinging spells from the side of the deck to sink hostile sailors. The job was dangerous, but paid well.

**Wizard, Soldier** - Battlemage: You studied a simplified tradition of magic focused on battlefield control before you served in an army. On the battlefield, you used clever tactics and deadly magic to secure victory and route the enemy, becoming a valuable asset in your mage battalion.

**Wizard, Urchin** - Child Prodigy: You were born a genius, with intellect to rival even the most wizened scholar before you were a teenager. Unfortunately, you were also born into a very poor family, who couldn't afford to get you a higher education. You eventually left your home, willingly or unwillingly, and had to live on your own. You pursued the magical arts, and received teaching and lecturing thanks to a master wizard who was kind enough to help you."

**Warlock, Acolyte** - The Chained God: Long ago, your church declared a crusade against an otherworldly foe that terrorized the land. An army of crusaders left the Material Plane and marched into another plane of existence, hoping to purge all that threatened the safety of the world. The crusaders captured a powerful heretic god, and imprisoned it inside a holy site. With time, the church learned how to siphon the deity's power, and taught their priests to use its magic. You are one of such Ur-Warlocks. Although you are confident in your ability to control your Pact Magic, many fear the Bound Beast will not remain shackled forever.

**Warlock, Charlatan** - Debtor: You gambled away every coin you had at the betting table, and saw your life go up in flames. Your friends and family all deserted you, fed up with your irresponsibility and your pleas for more money. Homeless, with no one to turn to for help, you eagerly accepted help from a strange individual offering to set you up with a new life, far away from this ruined one. While you have escaped financial ruin, your otherworldly debts are now a much, much bigger problem.

**Warlock, Criminal** - Under-Underworld: You work for a ruthless crime family that casts a frightening shadow over the criminal underworld. The godfather of the family is shrouded in mystery, but it is known to a select few of the family's inner circle that the Don is actually a powerful extraplaner entity hoping to expand their influence into the Material Plane.

**Warlock, Entertainer** - Hell Hound On My Trail: As an aspiring young Bard, you had aspirations of becoming a world-famous musician. Unfortunately, you were born tone-deaf, and couldn't play an instrument to save your life. Unable to accept this reality, you followed a rumor leading you to meet with a hooded figure near a crossroads at midnight. The stranger took your instrument, tuned it, and played the most beautiful song you have ever heard. After it was returned, you obtained mastery over the instrument, and knew how to play it flawlessly. Even though your dream of becoming a talented musician was achieved, when you spot the cloaked stranger silently watching your concerts, you sometimes ask yourself if you made the wrong decision.

**Warlock, Folk Hero** - Abducted: You were a commoner from an isolated village that rarely came in contact with the rest of civilization, except to buy and sell goods. One evening, while you were out on your porch, a bright light came from out of the sky and stole you away. While the details of your trip remain fuzzy, when you returned to your village, you had spontaneously learned how to channel arcane power you previously never had, among other things. Your new powers earned you the adoration and fear of the other common folk. Where your powers came from, or why you got them, remains a mystery to you. 

**Warlock, Guild Artisan** - Mad Artist: You were a skilled artisan in a guild of those with a similar craft. One night, you were approached by a powerful entity in your dreams who showed you the blueprints to a magnum opus, and commissioned you to create it. Creating such a piece would be extremely time-consuming and extraordinarily expensive, however the entity has promised you great rewards in exchange for constructing it.

**Warlock, Hermit** - Witch: You held ambitions of becoming a talented practitioner of forbidden magics. The practice of such witchcraft is taboo, and you would face certain execution if you were discovered. Secretly, you met with a few other like-minded individuals with similar dreams as you and formed a coven to summon a powerful outsider to make a pact with. After a long period of isolation in the wilderness, the coven discovered a forgotten ritual to conjure the name of an otherworldly being that would grant you all magical talents in exchange for servitude. The coven gladly accepted.

**Warlock, Noble** - New World Order: You are a member of an influential noble family that rose significantly in power almost overnight, upsetting the balance of powers in the political world. Unbeknownst to the public, your family has made deals with an extraplaner benefactor to mutually increase the influence of both parties involved. This is a very tightly held family secret, and if the scandal were to get out it would ruin the family name and likely result in open revolt.

**Warlock, Outlander** - Stranded: You were a hunter or traveler who, due to freak weather, faulty mapping, or arcane interference, found themselves hopelessly lost and on the verge of death. In your time of desperation, you called out to any divine being who might listen and begged them to save you. Your patron saw this opportunity and answered, forcing you to agree to every one of their terms in exchange for food and a way out. After surviving the ordeal, you begin to wonder if it was your patron who caused you to be lost in the first place...

**Warlock, Sage** - Occultist: You are an academic of the magical arts, and have spent years studying the history of spellcraft and the arcane. While researching planar magic, you stumbled upon, or sought out, an ancient book to commune with a mighty being from another plane of existence. After coming in contact with the book, the being was summoned and you found yourself either forced to accept its offer or allured by the promise of forgotten knowledge and arcana.

**Warlock, Sailor** - Cursed Treasure: There are rumors amongst sailors of cursed treasure stored inside damned grottos, and that any sailor who takes the treasure for themselves is doomed to serve a trickster god for the rest of their days. To you and your crewmembers, folklore became reality when you were mislead into forming a pact with an extraplaner patron after finding a mysterious stranded sailor who claimed to know the location of a lost pirate treasure. The ship soon became marooned in search of the treasure, and the stranded sailor revealed their true identity and forced the crew to make a pact with them in order to fix their ship and return home.

**Warlock, Soldier** - Besieged: You were a soldier in an army that was in charge of defending a castle or fortress that was surrounded by an enemy force. With supplies growing thin and the only choices appearing to be surrender or starvation, you made a pact with a mysterious stranger who offered to turn the tide of battle with arcane magic. You were granted the magical talents necessary to break the siege and route the enemy force. You tried to keep the pact secret from your comrades, but you were discovered and were forced to leave the army.

**Warlock, Urchin** - Orphic Orphanage: With no family to watch over you when you were young, you were sent to an orphanage after being discovered living on the streets. The kindly old woman who ran the orphanage was known to the children to be a different person behind closed doors; she taught the children the importance of planar summoning and occult rituals. You learned to invoke the name of a planar outsider, whom you made a magical pact with. Your relationship with your patron is like that of a parent and their children. You always felt comfort when you spoke with your patron, because you knew you were its child, and it would always love and protect you."
