I have a strong sense for justice that's why i fight the moment i feel something is not fair. That's why most people tend to think badly of me because i call them out when i notice that they lied or treated someone badly or in many cases myself. My family acts like they're soooo nice but they're really not. They want to look good in front of others but they're devils and witches. There no other way but to grow up like them i didn't know anything else. I had to learn how to be better than them and a better person in general."

It might be because of narcissism because of the strong will to always get what you want. But Maybe you should think about if the will to win really has something to do with narcissism or if it's an unhealthy obsession or maybe even an addiction. Maybe you should think about where this feeling comes from and why you might have it. Anyway don't let it get you into trouble.

Afterwards you have to repeat the story the person you picked told you. Only focus on the person that you picked. At first it's difficult and noisy gibberish.

I can tell him everything even if it annoys him. We work together as a team but we encourage each other to do things on our own as well because we can't rely on each only. We need to learn to be able to live our lifes even without each other. If you can't live on your own you can't live at all. 
Talk to her and when she gets sad you just hug her and encourage her to keep on talking to you about it. She should understand if it's that important to you. 
Good luck xxx"

Your answers did trigger some more questions. Like: if aluminium is in not only vaccines but also food.. what could happen if you have to much aluminum in your body?
And: Babies are vaccinated very early. Isn't it a bit too early? Shouldn't they develop their immune system on their own first or can it be dangerous if you boost their immune system up if their immune system is barely even developed?
Also I have read about something inside vaccines (I don't remember what it's called.. something with an E) that boosts your immune system up to be stronger and that there was a debate about it wether or not it causes multi immune disorders?"
doctors,eqr057k,t1_eqqyelb,1560240721.0,"Thanks for your reply. I have a six year old daughter, she is vaccinated and I will vaccinate all my kids (that is if I'll have any more kids). 
I'm not really doubting the vaccines but I doubt some doctors because they treated me like a criminal for asking questions. I understand the point of anti vaccine people, they're scared that the medicine itself makes them sick and they're scared of doctors and scientists errors. They're scared people that's why I can't be angry with them for their opinion on vaccines. Yes, there are side effects, some of them are not as bad and some are major but rare. But ""rare"" doesn't mean nothing will ever happen at all. I think that's what they're most afraid of,that they will hit this 1% that will get actually sick from whatever vaccine they get. But still, I don't understand why doctors reacted that way towards me. I'm a parent. I should be interested in what I do to/with my child and get educated. That's what a responsible parent should do in my opinion. But instead of getting answers I'm being treated badly for not doing something without asking questions. I feel like an agnostic standing in between a Christian and an Atheist and both are trying to convince me to choose a side without giving me any other reason but ""because I'm right!"" 
Like I said I'm not anti-vaccine. I only want to know what's inside and what it does. I feel like I should've become a scientist myself because asking questions and demanding explanations is just in my nature. 
I tried finding websites about vaccines. But there is this one issue, doctors only say what's good and only name reasons why I should do something and anti-vaccers only say what's bad about it and name reasons why I shouldn't do it. I want the realistic answers in between that name both. And that's why I can't find any answers because instead of telling the whole truth, good and bad in one, they only fight to prove that their opinion Is the only thing that's right."

And many more. I hate that my parents only want her to wear cute dresses and pink clothes. When my parents wanted to design my daughters room I thought I was lucky because they'd pay for everything themselves but that was a mistake. My daughter wanted blue in her room, now her room is completely pink. A Hello Kitty carpet floor and Butterflies on her wall with a wooden castle bed and white princess furniture which my daughter didn't want. 
My now boyfriend is a football fan. He once said to me that if we had a son he would turn him into a football fan and that he didn't have a choice. I wanted to slap him right then and there.
I bought my daughter Black Nikes. They were ""for boys"", she loves them. When it comes to raising a child I'm a frigging dictator. I won't let that happen again. My strong belief is that Boys and girls are to be treated equally in absolutely everything without question and that they deserve to choose themselves what they want.
I also hate that parents think they have more rights only because they're an adult. If they want their child to behave well, they need to behave well. That means if children aren't allowed to curse or hit or yell then parents shouldn't be allowed to do that either. Also children should be allowed to express their feelings instead of being told off or be punished for it."
