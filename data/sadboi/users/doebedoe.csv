First -- trying to figure out a way to fold [these 4 wedge supports](https://i.imgur.com/woaTlit.jpg) away when the platform isn't out (here's a mock up of them behind the seats not folded away -- taking up a lot of space: https://i.imgur.com/SAW4syU.png).  Given it's a bit over built (3/4"" birch ply) I'm wondering if I could just mount folding hinges opposite one another on each side of the platform so they will resist sideways loads. Another option is to make them both fold inwards and attach a third pop-up piece that goes in between the two to keep them from folding inwards. 

Second -- any obvious design issues with this cabinet? It will be made out of 3/4"" birch ply (top and sides) and 1/2"" ply (width-wise supports) with pocket hole + glue construction. [A view from the front](https://i.imgur.com/XVOcxGJ.png) showing a future fold-out deck and the basic design. The top support is about 6"" deep (hope to make a shallow drawer here eventually on the left side), and the bottom about 12"".

Once you're a full active patroller, you show up when you want (with a certain number of minimum days per quarter to maintain active status). During training, you have a few mandatory days, but most weekends you can pick the day you want.

All patrollers must be Outdoor Emergency Care certified. It is part of the training all incoming folks get. If you are already an EMT/Paramedic -- you can discuss with the instructors.

Training is long and intense. There are lots of phases to get through -- there is OEC, then there is mountain orientation, then their is OET (Outdoor Emergency Toboggan).

Testing information would only be useful *if* we knew the actual mortality rate of this disease, but that is far from well defined (as in, estimates are an order of magnitude different in both directions.) 

The best thing to model hospitalization rates and death rates are hospitalization and death rates. Both of which are reliably reported already."

What models are you basing this on? Being in healthcare doesn't make someone is an epidemiologist or public health specialist. Here are models by a large team of health researchers that suggest Colorado may be at (or even past) it's first peak: https://covid19.healthdata.org/projections

I work with a lot of people at CDPHE. There is a large diversity of opinions on what and when the peak looks like among them -- and they *are* trained epidemiologists who live in this data."

Denver,fmc606j,t1_fmc5k3u,1585939550.0,Correct. The state is only subsidizing care at licensed child care facilities in good standing that have agreed to participate in this program.
Denver,fmc50w6,t1_fmbncsr,1585939030.0,"It's funded for a short time for a small population from the federal COVID emergency act. It's an order of magnitude different cost than providing free child care universally. 

Don't get me wrong -- there is plenty of evidence that we ought to treat pre-K child care as a right just like we treat k-12 education. And we as a society could afford it if we had different priorities."

While from a public health perspective you may be correct, it's a balancing act. We need medical personnel, grocery store workers, etc through this crisis. They need child care. It isn't ideal."

Denver,fm5xvfe,t1_fm5ub1h,1585782188.0,"> They get a credit?

Yes, the CARE act included funding to help subsidize care for essential workers during this crisis. You can read a summary here: https://www.ffyf.org/heres-whats-included-for-child-care-in-the-congressional-covid-19-economic-stimulus-package/

> What about nonessential workers who are told to stay home with the kids, but their $1600/month child care bill continues?

For better or worse, child care is primarily a private market. There is not public funding to cover the costs of all unused care during this crisis.  It sucks for providers and families alike."

Denver,fm52km3,t3_ft24df,1585765164.0,"A few notes: 

- This is only for school-age child care (kids 5 and up) except the Schlessman site can care for kids under 5. 
- If you need care across the State or for a younger kid, you can sign up to get matched at https://covidchildcarecolorado.com/. 
- If you are categorized as an essential worker under the Gov's Public Health Order you are likely eligible for a tuition credit (essentially free care) until May 17th.  
- Given the problem of asymptomatic carriers, if you can care for your kid at home that is  a better option not just your families health, but for public health generally. 
- Child care centers must operate under stricter guidance from the Department of Colorado Public Health and Environment than typical (10 kids per classroom, groups are supposed to be stable, etc.)

Feel free to ask more questions if you're curious. If I can't get you answers, I can get you to people who can."

- 80% hydration did get a bit tricky to work. I gave some extra folds to increase strength. 
- 250g of starter is a lot now that i'm thinking about it. Suppose it was necessary though because my starter is still young and developing."
Denver,fm45u9z,t1_fm37ibt,1585747228.0,My point simply was: there are plenty of good ski mountains in this state not run by horrible corporations. Lumping them all together is disingenuous. Hence my heavily upvoted comment upthread.
