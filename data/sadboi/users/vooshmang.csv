Sol - 6/10 get fancy dress uniform or another misc that makes him look like a ""soldier"" the miscs don't work with the unusual. 

Pyro 7/10 goofy and fine

Demo 6/10 generic pub demo drip right here. either replace the armour with the cape or replace the hood with a knight hat. 

Heavy 7/10 just needs the yeti arms and you're set. 

Egg Can't rate this one

Med 7/10 a bit much is happening everywhere, but that's not that bad, maybe replace a misc with something a little more minimal. 

Sni 6/10 you got the middle scoreboard tryhard sniper drip. Remove the edge, the mics, keep the hat, maybe go for the villans veil and then get buds or some kind pocket cosmetic. 

Spy 7/10 your loadout would work without paint or the unusual.  replace misc with Distinguished Rogue or After Dark, glasses are fine. 

Little fixes and you'll be attracting all the meds."
