AskReddit,fk722ca,t1_fk716h9,1583925269.0,"Oof lemme just say first, sorry for this HUGE block of text. Depends on what you want to do there, and the time of year that you are going to be visiting. 

For example, spring time is the best time to be visiting Athens, that has most of our museums etc. etc. if you are the museum type of person.

 If you think you'd enjoy a city that's not as large as Athens but still has things to do, go to Thessaloniki. 

If you want an island feel that is romantic, with beautiful scenery and architecture, go to Santorini. (Yes it's kinda expensive BUT if you book early enough you'll find a good price, I booked in March for the end of July, and ended up spending less than 500â‚¬ in total, accommodation included.)

If you want super island experience but fear being dependent on ships, go to Crete (it's kinda big so it feels like mainland imo). 

If you are an outdoors-y kind of person that likes nature AND museums, go for Delfi/Olympia (in peloponnesos, NOT where olympus is). 

If you just want a chill vacation, there is a place called ""Killini"". And most of our ionian islands are worth visiting. 

As I said, lots of different places for different purposes. I would say though, if you dont wanna see a lot of drunk partygoers taking a piss in a sidestreet during the early hours of the morning, avoid Mykonos. It's the default ""Party Island"". Now I've personally never been but relatives and friends who have, said there is nothing special there except VERY expensive restaurants that are not worth the hype, and parties."
AskReddit,fk5yofy,t1_fk5rtl4,1583890336.0,"Yeah, Brits also have the same reputation in Greece, especially around the islands. Every year we have at least one case of ""Very drunk British guy does ridiculous thing and ends up injured"". No worries though, we know you guys are cool, besides, who is to say that ANY nationality is perfect? We know that it's mostly trashy people doing things so.... And we also have our own rotten apples here..."
entitledparents,fguhnx8,t3_f09p89,1581121049.0,"Holy molly you are so polite. I'm also an atheist and zero Christians have asked if they can pray in front of me (I come from a country where the majority of the population is Christian). I think tho that most atheists don't care if you pray in front of them, I mean, just because *I* am not a Christian/don't believe in God doesn't mean you also have to. If you wanna believe and it helps you, go ahead! Also what's with the Christian hate, I mean, most Christians I have met are super nice and normal ppl (I haven't met many fanatics tho, just one who kept saying that gays are sick and that non-believers will burn in hell or some shit)"

I get you not wanting to buy her something unnecessary or expensive like brand name clothes, but as a parent you are responsible for providing her with the basics, and that includes housing, food, some clothes and basic hygiene products. Plus she isn't asking you to buy her something super expensive, just tampons. She has her own money, yes, but, proportionately, you probably make more money than her, and are her parent and provider. You literally sound like the Spotify premium ad, just offering her the barest of bare minimum and telling her she has to pay up for something even in the slightest bit more expensive or different."
AmItheAsshole,fgnpwlt,t3_eyts0s,1580950279.0,"YTA. To me it sounds like you are trying to protect your image. So what, even if you DID take them amd INDEED nobody liked them? It sounds to me like you don't want your friends to think that your wife is a bad cook and you married a bad cook. That's assuming everyone would absolutely despise the cookies. But then again, people tend to have very different opinions on what tastes good and what not. If I were you, I'd have told my wife ""Hey, not a huge fan of these but we'll take them and see what everyone else thinks""."
AmItheAsshole,fgnotlz,t3_ez76tn,1580949611.0,"Holy shit YTA. Being vegan is a personal choice, one that you can only make for yourself and not others. You hated eating meat for him I assume (since you later became vegan) so why do you force YOUR diet upon him now? You are essentially doing the same thing - and even worse, he is elderly and dependent on you to take care of him so he basically has no choice but to comply. While you as a teen, probably weren't so dependent on HIM to bring you your food. The equivalent of what you are doing to him now would be him keeping you locked in your room, not letting you go out/choose something to eat, and force feeding you meat every single day for two months. And I'm not even going to comment on the health complications your imposed rules may result in - i.e. Malnutrition and protein deficiencies, if you aren't giving him very carefully planned, age and health status appropriate diet and supplements that he will most probably need."
AmItheAsshole,fg1yhhv,t3_ew9u6k,1580435124.0,"NTA. A human baby isn't the same as a dog, a 2h 20min commute isn't the same as a 20min one and it's not that the company was discriminating against her; she had her chance to work from home but it didn't work for her. My parents bought both my sisters phones. If one of them breaks hers and has to go back using her old one, it's not my other sister's fault, nor does she need to get her phone taken back om grounds of fair treatment.

Frankly the whole ""Us mothers should stick together"" part sounded a bit entitled to me. In no way is caring for a puppy equivalent to caring for a human baby."
unpopularopinion,fg1wer4,t3_ewd5ol,1580434217.0,"I 100% agree with you.

 I knew a couple and the girl was constantly overbearing. I was the one that helped them get together and boy.... She would text me every day about their relationship and how he must not like her because he isnt texting her back or returning her 4846768 calls... This was during exam season.

Anyway they soon broke up and she told me that she was being ""Overbearing"" and that's why he broke up with her.

 Some time later, I was driving her home, when conversation shifted to this topic. She started complaining about how the guy used her and the relationship destroyed her and blah blah blah when I cut her off and told her ""Wait, weren't you the one that told me that you were overbearing?"" so she just turned to me and said ""He should have known; he should have known and loved me as I am, because this is who I am and I'm not changing"".

And excuse me but that's a whole lot of bullcrap right there."

offmychest,eqk5hwt,t3_byikob,1560116474.0,"Okay maybe it sounds really harsh but.... This person... Was she really your friend? A friendship is a two-way sentiment/relationship. So, if sje was constantly annoyed by you and secretly hating you, she was never really your friend. You didn't lose a friend, you simply thought you had one. Now, as other comments state, you should cut her off. Start slowly. It is very very hard to replace someone you thought was really close to you. So start finding other people to hang out with, share stuff and so on, and over time cut communication with your toxic friend until you only just say hi/bye. Then you can block her too, it seems like she could have a lot of negative impact on you.... Now if you can stand it, you can also confront her, but as I'm a majorly anti-confrontational person I don't think I'd be able to just fight with my ex friend like that....."

I dont wanna see pics of me or snap stories of me or ANYTHING unless I take it and make sure that I look my best. Needless to say I avoid full body shots and only do selfies. I honestly feel embarrassed. But even when Id gotten to a healthy bmi (I got the weight back bc of a bad combo of medication and sedentary lifestyle) I got more and more obsessed with losing weight and with the fact that I didn't look the way I wanted to.

Almost all my teachers and professors in school praised me and said I was extremely smart (except one bald santa looking asshole, if you see it, fuck you mister E.), I aced my mathlete exam (about 1% of my country manages that) and got into pharmacy school with an average exam score of 90% and then.... University. I spiraled into depression and anxiety, got diagnosed with OCD and now I'm completely average and barely passing my classes, have a hard time concentrating and procrastinate during studying. My therapist insists that I'm extremely smart and even prescribed me anti-GABA (neuro-transmitter antagonists) in order to stop my neurons from over-firing and thus me from over-thinking but.... It doesn't work that well and I'm still curled into myself crying twice a week at least. Fun times."

Also prone to extreme boredom. Although to be honest I see a little bit of my self in every single one of my fave characters, I think Sherlock's the best fit for me."
