Codependency,fnafv02,t3_g082jv,1586796774.0,"One of the tools I use is to keep a gratefulness journal. Actively writing down how appreciative of the things your SO does is a great tool if your prone to the codependency tunnel vision (why isn‚Äôt he calling me? He must hate me! He‚Äôs abandoning me!). 

Every morning and before bed I write down 5 things I am grateful for specific to my partner. Include the little things too (such as texting good morning, checking up on you throughout the day) and the big things too (calling you, watching a movie over Skype together). If you can‚Äôt think of anything, write some things he has done in the past as well as positive character traits!

Once you have a negative, codependency thought, I recommend journaling it and answering some of these questions! 

1. Is this thought based on fact or opinion? 

2. What evidence supports that this thought is true? Untrue?

3. What different way can I perceive this thought? How can I look at the bigger picture?

4. Will this thought matter in a year? 

5. Is this thought important enough to deal with right now? Can I come back to this later?

6. Self care check! Did I have enough sleep, practice good hygiene, eat, fulfill my daily to-do list? Is something else making me anxious? 


Reflection After 

1.  What triggered this thought? What can I do next time to cope in a healthier manner? (If..then..)

2. How can I productively discuss my worries/anxieties in the moment? How can I refocus next time? What did I do positively this time? 

3. Write a gratefulness statement for this challenge and 3 positive affirmations. (Does not necessarily have to be true, fake it til you make it!)."

AmItheAsshole,fl6vynh,t3_fmxtpv,1584885077.0,"I‚Äôm going against the grain and say NAH. People have insecurities. 

I am also a taller woman and taller than my SO. I was an early bloomer compared to my peers, so I easily towered over all the girls and 90% of the boys since 4th grade. I was bullied pretty relentlessly for it and used to have some of the same habits as your girlfriend.

 My SO sat me down and we had an honest, loving, and compassionate conversation on why i felt the need to do certain things, and what we can do together. It has made me more confident and I feel more empowered. If he told me to just straight up stop and ‚Äúgrow up‚Äù, I‚Äôd be pretty damn resentful. (This is not to say my insecurities are his responsibility, but why not be kind to someone your in a relationship with?) 

Telling her to ‚Äúgrow up‚Äù and being unkind with her about it is going to bring you father apart.

On the flip side, my SO used to be extremely insecure about his acne and his weight. He refused to take his shirt off the first 1 1/2 years of our relationship. Growing up he was bullied in locker rooms, made fun of by his past girlfriends, and his siblings would call his body/back gross. Telling him to ‚Äúgrow up‚Äù and ‚Äúbe a man‚Äù to take off his shirt wouldn‚Äôt have solved anything. Now he is more confident and comfortable in his body. It took lots of love and reassurance, but it‚Äôs worth it seeing him feel so confident and happy to just swim at the beach without a shirt on."
