You can't just discard the scientific method because you want to swing your dick around over this. I'm not here to argue with you, just to provide a point of order.

I am well aware of the comparisons that have been made between the two. But all of them have made the point of distinction between the two pretty obvious. Im also aware of the theory you're referencing. Purporting of them being ""condemned to the wilds by god"" and perhaps they could therefore be bigfoot based on this.

 That was from the late 90s, it was pretty much discounted after the Kandahar sighting in 2005. Again, a contemporary report that has been well documented. The original proponents of the Nephilim/Bigfoot comparison theory have retracted it on television programs discussing the Kandahar incident.

Besides that, there are contemporary reports of Nephilim that are in no way comparable to reports of Bigfoot. Logic would dictate it obvious they are clearly not the same thing, based on these descriptions alone.

There would be no benefit to the research of either in lumping them together as the same entity.

Everyone wants to believe. But you're doing yourself a disservice by ignoring the established scientific methodology of researching and classification just to fit your stubborn narrative based on some mysterious ""truth"" that of course, you won't reveal because we're ""ignorant"" and ""not ready.""

CrawlerSightings,fo2656l,t3_g4efqh,1587450957.0,"FWIW. I have been following reports of these things for nearly a decade now. I think the most logical conclusion from a cryptozoological research perspective is that it is some form of cryptid yet undiscovered and thoroughly studied. Though reports and definitive details on this subject are more recent. Within the last 20 years, but some reports might go back further and are misidentified or miscataloged.

Based on reports, there are many repeating details that one is able to compile into a fairly decent profile of the creature. This is from part of my own research notes I've been working on:

-they are often spotted during the night. Most likely nocturnal.

-most often found near areas of old growth and forested regions, areas with hilly or rocky terrain and in most instances cave networks. As well as reports from areas with abandoned or dilapidated structures. This leads me to believe they dwell in caves, dense undergrowth or abandoned manmade structures.

-a few reports have been from places where human habitation has encroached upon the above areas. Since the influx of new housing development in rural regions, this could explain the uptick in reports in recent years. Including in urban areas. 

-they are most often described as pale gray or white,  large eyes, sunken features. An emaciated appearance in body structure. Sometimes with long fang like teeth or claws. Most consistantly reported as humanoid in appearance.

-usually described as being in a hunched or sitting posture. About 3'-4' tall in this posture.
Standing height varies from 6' anywhere up to 8' or 9'. Though witness testimony is often unreliable in these matters.

-its gait ranges from the eponymous ""crawling"" on either all fours or a bipedal stance. Running as well varies from quaradepal to bipedal. Though most accounts that describe this interchange describe it as awkward to say the least.

-witnesses often report an overwhelming sense of fear or evil. Though a few have reported a sense of calm. These reports are highly subjective as human reaction to stressful situations can manifest counterintuitive emotional responses.

So my hypothesis is that this is some form of scavenger cryptid that has been living in either cave networks or deep in forests. Humans have encroached on these areas and this is leading them to be spotted more and more.

If you follow reports of bigfoot and similar cryptids, this is often the case when people begin to go where they haven't been before.

Also I think that it is worth looking into the correlation between the rise of fracking and most invasive mining techniques in recent years and the rise in sightings of this creature.

There are many things we've yet to discover. The world is a big place. Its not out of the realm of possibility that a humanoid cryptid such as this, if indeed it is a scavenger, would be able to survive for a very long time without encountering and avoiding humans. I'd argue that it is more believable than bigfoot, which many researchers have conceded would need a large breeding population and territory in order to survive. 

Theres also many similarities to folklore. Obvious comparisons can be made to wendigo, skinwalkers, ghouls, or even the recent rake copypasta. But I do not believe this creature is any of those. But I'm not ignoring the possibility that if this is indeed some form of undiscovered animal or humanoid, and it has been around a long time, it could have inspired those folkloric tales. I find that notion in itself particularly intriguing.

----
So that is my answer to your query. I hope it made sense.

I've been meaning to type this up for a while. I see alot of confusion and questions about this creature on the subs recently. Perhaps now I can go back and refine it and add to it. There's some more stuff I've been working on in regards to my research on the subject.

Unless it directly affects them, they won't change their minds. Even then, it's hard to break through decades of propaganda and indoctrination into the mindset they follow.

This is why any attempt to challenge them or entice them to self reflect causes them to lash out. They don't believe in anything and it makes them feel good to just troll and make other miserable because they're powerless to do anything, and they know it. It's their own personal hell really.

Sims3,fnx7vx8,t1_fnx4o99,1587333225.0,"I just got back into the game. It was driving me nuts that the game kept dragging. So I poked around in the edit town menu. Even at normal lifespan all my sims were aging too quickly to procreate and keep the ecosystem of the town balanced properly. Just about every house had 3+ elders and the kids were mostly teens.

The game would compensate by moving in families with children, but the same cycle would repeat.

Finally, I set all the elders to die off in 3 days time. That helped a bit.

Also, I learned if you use console commands to make friends or spawn in sims via the mailbox, sometimes the game would spawn in random sims with no home. They'd all end up clogging the streets, passing out from tiredness and constantly complaining about hunger. That alone was annoying.

I think I've finally got my town stabilized but it took alot of work, switching between households, moving people around and making sure everyone had a job and a home or was properly married off with homes to support growth of the families.

Sorry for the long winded comments, but I'm pretty proud of the hard work I've put in without mods to get the game balanced. So it is possible to fix issues on older saves with a little time and perseverance."
Sims3,fnwwpen,t3_g49dyu,1587326935.0,"As long as story progression is activated the other sims in the town will grow up, have kids, move in and out the towns,  etc..

There is also a button to toggle aging off and on in general, even if story progression is turned on. You can set the age progression of each individual generational category, as in how long each stage of life lasts. For example, babies age to toddlers after 2 days, toddler to child after 5 days, child to teen after 14 days etc..

 I usually set my elder sims to die off after a week or so, they tend to stick around clogging up the population and preventing other sims from having babies. I make an old folks home close to the cemetary and stick all my elders  there through the edit town menu.

On that note,  if you have issues with lag, you can disable pets and other things in the population menu to keep things running more smoothly. Lots of issues caused by overpopulation of pets and service sims getting stuck in the towns.

This, amoung other things, is why I like Sims3. It has the most control and customization in the series.

The base game story progression has it's quirks for sure. But it keeps things interesting. 

I'm not into modding, but there's a few SP mods (NRAAs comes to mind) that are go to mods that are highly recommended for this."

Oftentimes,  guides take safari onto protected lands or into wildlife preserves to bag their quarry. Hardly the ""thrill of the hunt.""

Those big games safaris you see these posts from? Usually those are rich assholes who pay some shady group of poachers a ton of money to trot out a drugged up endangered animal for them to shoot and take pics of and act like they are Alan Quartermain. In reality, it's just another rich pussy with a gun and toxic masculinity shooting at an animal that is in no position to defend itself.

IDontWorkHereLady,fnwmjqb,t3_g44v5p,1587321245.0,"I've told this story before. But it applies here.

I was in a hobby store a few years back. In one of the aisles was a display of feather boas and other dress up toys.

There were two little boys (about 7yo.) Who were playing with the feather boas and giggling, having fun as kids do.

This old woman (their grandmother, I assume) turns the corner into the aisle and just screams at these boys, screeches really, at the top of her lungs.

She is cussing them in Spanish and really pissed. She tears the boa off one of the boys' necks and proceeds to spank the kids in the middle of the aisle. The whole time screaming obscenities at them in spanish. Calling them ""jotos"" ( derogatory slang for homosexuals) and slapping the shit out of them.

The kids were completely caught off guard and absolutely terrified. Crying and begging for what they did that was wrong and why they were being punished.

The staff at the store tried to intervene and she yelled at them too, until security was finally fed up with the attention, asked her to leave, and she dragged the crying boys out of the store.

This whole incident took maybe 30 seconds to a minute and I was dumbfounded to the point of speechlessness at what I was witnessing.

I felt so bad for those little kids. That they have to grow up with such a horrible ignorant wench for a relative."

So when the NT starts. It basically says ""forget all those rules because we dont need to preserve our population anymore.""

Religion will always been one of those decisive things that will never have a common ground. Too many conflicting ideologies and ideas. Even groups within the same religion can't agree on their own ideologies. It would be one thing if things were clearly defined, but they're not. That grey area leaves too much open for interpretation and exploitation.

 The root of the evils of the modern interpretation of religious beliefs isn't in the beliefs themselves. It's in the greed inherent in the human condition that causes religion to become a weapon.

 That is the point you have to ask yourself if your belief system is worth it. To lump yourself in with the ""bad actors"" in the vain belief that your words and actions will speak louder than their's and change hearts and minds. Spoiler: it won't. 

The misdeeds and detrimental aura of religion has permeated too deep and its become politicized. There's no hope of going back to anything worth saving from religion at that point in our modern society. You don't need religion to make you a good person. You just *be a good person.*"

Thank you for sharing your experience. You are right that there are many strange creatures running around down here in Texas. You are not alone.

I've since spoken to some close friends and other folks I know that research this kind of stuff. I'm the first one I've found that has seen a black version of what we've determined is probably a ""crawler"". Which have a growing number of sightings, particularly in rural areas or areas with abandoned buildings or green space nearby. 

I've had a few crazy experiences and seen some things in my lifetime living out in the Texas country. I'm just getting back to reddit after being away. But I love collecting and researching stories of cryptids and humanoid creatures from Texas,  particularly South Texas. 

Cities are expanding so quickly down here and humans are moving into areas they haven't been before. It's not surprise there has been an uptick in activity and reports from the state in recent times.

There is also strong overlap with 19th century and turn of the 20th century accounts from settlers and native americans.
