 maybe do some research on a good cleanser that's not just micellar water (i personally haven't found a great one yet so i can't recommend anything; but i just ordered yttp superfood cleanser) i know cleanser helps a lot in a routine.

also maybe you could try just HA without the other moisturizing factors; and it might help breakouts"

Gifted,fq45gis,t3_ggmule,1589073857.0,"tbh i think gifted is an important designation for kids; it doesn’t mean you’re a genius it just means you learn differently. gifted kids are more likely to have mental illness, social problems, or adhd. you can’t just put these kids in a ‘normal’ classroom and expect them to thrive. plus there is an intelligence element to it that’s important to recognize; my parents thought i was stupid as a kid because i was forgetful and had my head in the clouds. i would have grown up feeling stupid had i not come to thrive in the gifted program. gifted people arent geniuses or prodigies or the only smart people in the world; they’re just people who express their intelligence in ways that can be imperceptible to the regular school system / society."
