Coronavirus,fms594w,t1_fms0zg8,1586346982.0,"Don't see how comparing a fundamental force of the universe to its creation is silly but the point is that both can be measured in some way while the crackpot theories can't be in any meaningful way, but you suggested that they're equally dubious, which is pedantic given the fact that you don't believe in it. That, to me, is very much LIKE the logic of a solipsist, and I get that you aren't espousing those beliefs but it's just tremendously aggravating to see anyone say ""Hm well ya never know for sure!"" to something that's so clearly horseshit devised to make a living for a fear-mongering grifter that believes climate change is a hoax. 

Sorry, genuinely, this is way more than I wanted to get into this but the people that believe this shit just evade and deflect, and I guess I have a hard time abiding by otherwise sensible people having soft reactions to these lies"
Coronavirus,fmrw7cw,t1_fmrun2m,1586337730.0,"Again, youtube is a corporation, not the American government, I don't know how else to explain that. They haven't infringed on any rights and you can see that's the case by how much they've been allowed to censor content to date. For instance, they don't allow hardcore porn on their platform; would you call that an infringement on our freedom of expression or is it just them upholding their own content restrictions?

Anyway, the kind of misinformation that career grifter is spreading is worthless, as much as it was a bad move on their part to censor it, he doesn't deserve anything resembling a platform."

We see leftover radiation and the history of expansion in the universe and our best guess as to what cause both is the big bang, and while that's much more dubious than the existence of gravity, it's far more plausible and logical than saying Lizardfolk from Draco infiltrated our governments.

The only thing you or I know with absolute certainty is that we exist but that shouldn't be license to think like a solipsist, it's just absolutely pointless."
