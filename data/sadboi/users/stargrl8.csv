relationship_advice,f5cbdg2,t3_dniu4f,1572132654.0,"I’m sorry that you’re going through this girl! Being cheated on sucks. Seriously.  Tell him that you’d like to just see their messages for closure or some crap or look through his phone while he’s sleeping lol but get some proof and write down her number to confirm it to his boss if you do bring it up. It’s gonna be hard and uncomfortable to see messages between them but he could try to sue you for defamation and try to prove his affair false. Get your screenshots and run girl. You’re so young and I’m sure beautiful, don’t waste time with someone who can’t respect you and put you and your relationship first!"

Hoping to learn more about what my current situation is teaching me and where I can go from here :/ please and thank you 🙏"
relationship_advice,f58ui4v,t3_dn4xi5,1572064373.0,"It’s the little things :)
Sometimes all you need to hold on is a tiny bit of hope.. There’s a big ol world out there filled with all kinds of beauty and wonder and this was just a little glimpse. Hold on to that. And take care."
SuicideWatch,f4jjemf,t3_dkfkaq,1571620650.0,This is exactly how I feel. I figure that in maybe a few years when my family all goes their separate ways and living their own lives I’ll just end it then.
relationship_advice,ewl4oyf,t3_cot929,1565505775.0,"The base of it is that he told you one thing, yet did another. You definitely have a right to be upset about that. 
But some word of advice! I’m not going to try to change your stand on weed, but it definitely does help with so much stuff. Is he going through anything? Maybe he isn’t even talking about it, or maybe you don’t even notice, but he might be! I know I went through a period of time where my ex felt like I was prioritizing weed over him. But I was actually in a deep depression and I would just smoke to distract myself. If that’s the case, then maybe take a step back. Also, I would try asking him to not smoke until *after* you hang out, or at least not right before. Relationships come down to sacrifice– from both sides. Try meeting in the middle :)"
relationship_advice,ewl46ce,t3_cotbwt,1565505121.0,"I think it’s mostly out of respect. It would probably be different if they were like “celebrities” or something, but since it was sent directly to you from people you likely think are attractive it’s a bit weird. I think that would forsure make me uncomfortable in my relationship! But talk to your girlfriend– there’s def some underlying insecurity that she has and is using her friend to hide behind. That causes a lot of problems so try just working that out!"
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,ew2y7dg,t3_cmk8xf,1565058881.0,That’s crazy!! Did your friend that was with you remember you complaining of your stomach? It’s insane to me that your girlfriend witnessed “you” being stabbed! Sounds like you switched timelines. Or maybe somehow felt the pain before the stabbing? Which in turn caused you to step outside... to get stabbed. I’m so glad you’re okay though and don’t have the memory of that. Maybe it was even a coping mechanism and you made yourself believe in something less traumatic. Either way it’s super interesting!
self,evwvoub,t3_clkxy1,1564874668.0,I completely relate. I too have had relationships ruined over it. It sucks because you can’t even control it omg. But something that I’ve recently started incorporating daily is being more mindful about each thing I’m doing and taking it one task at a time. Hopefully that helps you out a little bit too!
self,evur968,t1_evtnsly,1564803639.0,Totally agree with the first part lol. But yeah im trying to be more open to it so that hopefully that day comes sooner for me!! Thanks :)
self,evuqtog,t1_evtbc62,1564803243.0,hi there!! the feeling is definitely mutual <3
self,evuqrtz,t1_evta801,1564803198.0,I hope so! :) thanks so much
self,evirz0c,t1_evhad95,1564548093.0,Congrats! And be safe :)
self,eve9akp,t3_cjkmqs,1564459444.0,Go the speed limit. Don’t go too slow and never go above. And make complete stops. Good luck!!
Psychic,eu895ss,t3_cf93kb,1563552351.0,How can I move forward into the next chapter in my life?
dating_advice,eu26go2,t3_cef3h6,1563383367.0,"Most people wear padded bras, it’s not unusual and it’s not anything to be ashamed about. Girl I go from bralettes which keep me at a small B cup to a bombshell the next day where I have some *clearly grown overnight* D cup boobies. You’re just accentuating your features sweetheart, keep doing you. I used to feel like I was deceiving my boyfriends but just think for a moment– would you want to be in a relationship with someone who wont accept you at your various titty sizes? I’m sure your boyfriend loves your body regardless and if you do undress in front of him and he makes you feel ashamed, that’s your cue to run girl."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,eu21g1m,t3_ceeubq,1563380227.0,"That’s super interesting! I recently experienced a freeway “glitch” too. I was also driving home after work. I always take the same freeway home, so I kinda went into autopilot lol. I’m like 5 mins from home when I look up and the scenery behind the freeway just looked completelyyyy different. Like I had never seen this view and I take this freeway multiple times a week. Even the names of the exits seemed slightly off. It was like I was on an entire different freeway. Next day I was coming back from work again and it was all back to normal. Super weird"
self,esgsmcr,t3_c7ox4j,1561964888.0,"I’m the same exact way! I definitely favor my own company than others most of the time, but yeah it does get a little boring. What I’ve found to be helpful in connecting with others is through hobbies and interests. I’ve become great friends with a girl in my yoga class, and also with a few people from my local church"
SimsMobile,ernaus7,t1_ermikdx,1561048553.0,It was “cuddle at party with..” and I chose my girl sim but she clearly did not want to come in ! lol
