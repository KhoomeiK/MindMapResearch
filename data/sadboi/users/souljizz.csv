PetBehavior,f8rckon,t3_e18ec3,1574737116.0,"Okay I guess I need to clarify much more here. I was very upset when I posted and left out many crucial details cause I was all emotional. I am very gentle with all my animals and have had animals of all types in my home my whole life. I have learned pretty dang well how to read their body language and what they like/don’t like specific to each one. When I come home from work my cats get almost all my attention. I play, cuddle and hang out with them. Other than working I hardly ever leave my house so i’m with them constantly. Overall I play well over an hour a day most days with them. And more on days off. But things are changing, Nova is turning into a little monster before my eyes. She demands my attention at all times and gets aggressive when I try to do anything else. I can hardly give my other cat attention either without her butting in and getting jealous. The older cat doesn’t really care though, she’s very independent and I annoy her a little with all my attention lol. I’ve moved into a new place about 7 months ago and am now able to have more animals but I can’t because of her jealousy.  I also should add that when I have people over she gets protective over me and jealous that i’m giving them my attention and will go after them very aggressively. I can’t invite people over anymore because of her. With the situation of my cat being on my chest and scaring me: I do not “man handle” her. I’ll be extra clear here: I would NEVER be aggressive with her. When I try to take her off me or move I am very sweet and gentle as I always am with her. She’s my baby. But she doesn’t give a shit how gentle I am, she either growls and runs away or she doesn’t budge and starts growling and hissing and I feel her claws extend so yes for MY SAFETY I scruff her. She is a small cat with a large scruff, it does not hurt her. I used to work as a vet tech it is an extremely common way to subdue a cat. She understands the word no and the change in tone. I don’t scream at her and go on and on. I say “no.” once firmly. She’s an intelligent cat, she understands what it means. She simply doesn’t care one bit. And I am especially scared because when I fall asleep with her on me or if she crawls on me while i’m asleep if I move she might attack me when i’m very vulnerable. If I lock her out of my room though she will cry loudly all night and I can’t sleep. I spoke to the vet about it when I took her a couple weeks ago and all she said was that this behavior is normal for hand raised kittens and it is what it is. Though after her attacking me I am going to contact her again. But still I’m hoping someone here might know something to help. I’d prefer not to have to give her medication if it can be avoided. She has always been clingy and a bit jealous but this behavior is getting worse and worse everyday."
