schizophrenia,fp7j4oz,t1_fp7dpfm,1588371593.0,"It will probably be very uncomfortable bringing all of this up with your parents, and I assume you have some anxiety about it, but once you reach out for some help you may very well find great relief from that anxiety. Right now it seems to me like there is a ticking time bomb, and you don't know when it will go off or how much damage it could possibly cause, and you may not want to tell anyone else there is a bomb because you don't want to cause any panic over something if you think that it may resolve itself over time somehow and isn't a huge deal after all, like you're protecting everyone else from the chaos that you're feeling and don't want to be a burden. But if that bomb does go off, and it does severe irreversible damage, you are going to regret not taking action before things got worse. You're going to wish you could go back to when there was something you could do to possibly fix all of this. I may be making assumptions about your situation and I may be wrong about certain things, but I do know that once you push through the initial anxiety about taking action and getting help you will start taking back control of this situation and feel some relief, because right now you are not in control of this problem and it may be playing a huge part in your unsettled feelings."
gaming,fp7hgkn,t3_gbqc8p,1588370697.0,"I see you have Tiger Woods PGA Tour for xbox360. I loved playing those games. It's a very nice casual game, where you can just mess around and have fun, or you can play career mode and take it as seriously as you want. With career mode you can enjoy the process of making your player better and customizing their look. You don't have to lock yourself in for very long if you don't plan on playing for hours. You can get through 18 holes pretty quickly if you want to and can speed up time while the ball is in the air. But Tiger Woods was never enough to satisfy all my gaming needs, so you would maybe want to have another game you're actively playing if you ever feel bored with it.

Fallout 3, Fallout: New Vegas, and Skyrim caught my attention as well. These are huge games with huge potential for adventure. You never have to play them the same way twice, so you're experience going through them the first time may be completely different than the second time, which can keep them fresh for you even if you already played through them. You can play through being thoughtful and strategic with your decisions. You can take a detour at anytime you want to mix things up and do some side quests or exploring. You can try different combat builds, or try a play through where you level up Charisma and Speech and avoid fights altogether. You can go off the rails and start killing everyone you see, even if they aren't enemies (I would save your game right before you do this though in case you ruin the storyline too much). One way to play through Fallout games that I have fun with is to specialize in melee combat instead of using guns. And it doesn't require ammo which can become an issue in Fallout very easily if you don't spend a lot of time scavenging. 

You may also find the inspiration to play if you found a game you've never played, or even choose a genre you typically don't play. There are so many genres of gaming, and there seems to be a genre that suits every kind of person. Some game genres to get you thinking might be: Racing, MMORPG, Real-time Strategy, Simulation, Fighting, Indie, Sports, Dungeon crawlers, card games/casino games, and of course there are many more. Playing a genre you don't normally play will force you to think in new ways and strategize differently. You may open up an entirely new world of entertainment for yourself that you weren't aware of before.

Well I hope this inspires you to want to play these games and give them a second life, and to try something new. Happy gaming!"

Maybe you could talk to your parents about seeing what a doctor thinks of that, and tell them it would most likely be much cheaper than therapy. Also, not every therapist is the same. One therapist might do what yours did, and another might take you more seriously and try to help more. Try not to let the opinion on one therapist get to you too much.

Lightning ports can handle more power going through them, so they charge devices faster. They are also more durable than the other options. But with USB-C they are no longer superior. And the USB-C is attractive to apple because they want to keep their connectors symmetrical so you can plug it in both ways.
