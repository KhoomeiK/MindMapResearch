My sleeping cycle has been crazy for the last 10 years. I worked as a mover in Europe since I was 14. Sometimes I didn't sleep for 24h+. I learned to sleep for 30 to 60 minutes and keep going at work... It was horrible. I even ended up falling asleep behind the wheel and crashed the car... It was stupid. I agree. 

I value sleep much more now even though my old circle of close friends ( I got rid of them) told me that I will never be successful sleeping for more than 6 hours a day. 

I believe that we should try to fall asleep before midnight and get our 7 to 8 hours in. We shouldn't eat 2 to 3 hours before going to bed for sure."

2017

I found myself in a deep depression and could find the purpose of my life. I remember lying on the couch as I came across the famous ""here in my garage"" ad on YouTube. The guy named Tai Lopez was showing his beautiful car and talking about reading one book a day. 

It was always fascinating to me how people can read a book fast and still understand or even learn from it. I wanted it too but never tried to. 

This ad got me thinking about it for a long time. 

I traveled back to Poland in Europe as I wanted to be closer to my family and nature. Probably nature had the biggest impact on me. There I came across another Social Media guru talking about how reading ""Awaken The Giant Within"" by Tony Robbins has helped him to leave the production line job and build his own business. Fun fact was - he had exactly the same Italian sports car in the background. 

Finally, I did it!

I ordered that book. It took me months to finish but during the first chapters I ordered more books. I finished reading ""Awaken The Giant Within"" and seven more books. 

From that moment on, my life began to change rapidly. I fell in love with reading and woke up 2 hours earlier every single day to read. I was very slow at it but I knew that with the practice I become a speed reader and my comprehension will be huge too. 

Three years later I am challenging myself with 150 books in 2020. It's May and I've read 56 already. 

Did I mention how my life has changed? 

Are you interested?

I came back to the US motivated as hell. Writing it right now makes me motivated as I think about my 'Come Back'. It was exciting. I began to work for my brother in the solar industry and help him scale his business to multiple 7 figures. 

More importantly, I met my future WIFE! My lovely wife Klaudia. She is Polish BUT we have met in Corona, CA. It was love at first sight. Klaudia and I got married in Poland last year. We have our wedding video on my IG :) 

Today, we are committed to reading every single day.  We begin each day with a cup of coffee (or tea) and a book. We also finish each day by reading. We also started our own business in the CBD industry. 

We recorded a small-talk about our reading journey + we are doing a book giveaway by the end of the video. Feel free to  watch it:

There is a great book written by Simon Sinek with that brilliant title. I believe you gave yourself an answer. I totally feel you and been struggling with it since I quit my 9-5. I thought that everything will change and my body will follow and adopt to the change. It was far away from it. What do you love to do? Perhaps, it‚Äôs sport or reading. Perhaps, starting a side hustle. 
You need to find a deep ‚Äòwhy‚Äô. Everything will change. Jim Kwik has a formula for motivation it‚Äôs (motivation = purpose x energy x s^3).
It has helped me as well. My wife and I put together a eBook bundle that we giveaway for free. You can learn (over 263 pages) about anxiety, meditation, sleep, and stress management. It might help too. Here is the link https://www.liefroyalhemp.com/unlock-the-best-version-of-you

I found something that you should definitely look into. The science behind it makes sense and I already am doing that for over 6 months. Plus, I‚Äôve shared it with our close friends and they experience very good results. I have a friend named Alex. She is a trainer at OTF. She has to wake up at 330 AM 3 days out of the week. You can imagine her messed up sleep schedule. She tried it and she loves it. Check us out. We post daily on Instagram (at)LiefRoyal

I hope that helps!"
sleep,foi3eo9,t3_g6y9qg,1587777913.0,"I feel you. I've been looking for sleep hacks for years.

 Even though I had insomnia only for a short period of time (a few months - just before making the decision to move to the US) - I couldn't find that magic time for my optimized sleep.

 I can definitely recommend reading the book ""Why We Sleep"" by Matthew Walker. It explains a lot. It explains why Bill Gates only regrets not getting enough of quality sleep.

It's going to be a good start.

Next, I would make sure you are really tired ( like falling-asleep-as-soon-as-your-head-hits-the-pillow-tired). Avoid any blue lights. 4 weeks ago my wife and I started leaving the phone outside and cut the usage after 9 PM. It helped a lot. Especially, waking up is much easier.

Let's continue. 

Cold showers in the morning and in the evening are amazing and there is science behind it. We are daily putting educational content on our IG \[at\]LiefRoyal . Feel free to DM us and let's have a conversation. We have many sleep-success stories to share. 

Finally, reduce stress and calm down. We found a good way to create that 'entourage' effect. Sleep is the master key to health, good mood, and a strong immune system. 

I hope that helps! 

Matt"
