GWAScriptGuild,fpfoovy,t3_gd4uoa,1588578034.0,"Hello!

Sorry for the unsolicited opinion — I figured that since it’s on reddit, unsolicited opinions in the thread is acceptable especially if it’s not unruly/offensive. 

My thoughts:
1. Your points and opinions are VALID and IMPORTANT. I acknowledge them. 
2. I think due credit should always be given to the script writer. I have script writer friends and the ‘output’ — i.e. audio — will never be completed without their script. Although definition of what ‘due credit’ is can be highly subjective. 
3. At the end of the day, your script is YOUR intangible property. Same goes with audio creators. Their audios are THEIR intangible properties. I have to say, those audio fills are being infringed too by reposting on the same sites — hence, two sides in the story and what you encounter isn’t limited to you. 
4. Audio creators AND script writers both can’t protect their intangible properties for others gaining monetary benefit from it UNLESS they would take legal courses in line with the intellectual property laws of your country/state. And that is costly. Cost outweighs the benefits. 

Solution: If you thought that you’re credited poorly for your work, talk to the audio creator. They can make the necessary changes. Speak up. Keeping mum and talking anonymously wouldn’t resolve anything. 

That’s just my humble unsolicited opinion. 

Take care and have a good day!"
