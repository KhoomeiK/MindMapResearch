Advice,eq4d7r9,t1_epsbdvl,1559774405.0,"First of all, you're an angel. thank you for taking your time and giving so much advice (I've entered your profile for a little, got curious about your tag haha)

And yes, the file opened for me and i'm going to fill it soon. I'm changing therapists and I have a very hard time trying to remember what I went through and how i feel like when I'm in a crisis; this looks like a pretty methodical and objective way to help me to remember ways to adress my problems and how to create a certain focus on what I feel more often and what feelings are less common in my condition.

To me, putting all of it in paper helps so much to get my feelings in place and this safety plan feels like a methodical approach to do it.

The only bad side for me is that I live in Brazil, so i can't reach 1-800-273-TALK; the equivalent in my country is 188 (CVV) but it doesn't work at all; 100 people maximum waiting list and they hang you up quickly and it's a more stressful session than a relieving one.

At the bottom, in small text, the Safety Plan reads:

I guess this means not using it in therapy sessions and professional help or nah?"
