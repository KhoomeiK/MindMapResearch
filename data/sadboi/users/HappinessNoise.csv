aromantic,foxlbpn,t3_dwiu2p,1588147630.0,"I'm Freddie and I prefer they them pronouns.

I'm 16 and I live in the Midwest in the USA

I'm here because I am asexual and questioning if I am aro as well

I like to bake, listen to music, read, and watch scary movies

I like music from all genres (I'm always looking for new music, so if you have any suggestions I'd love to hear them). I like psychological thrillers and horror movies.

My aesthetic is anything dark and comfy

I'm looking forward to spending time with my dog this weekend and baking some delicious food."
