Her response: ""Try it part time first. If you've got enough interest from clients, and you like it, and you're making enough money, THEN quit your day job"".

It's really stuck with me. I know she was giving general advice for normies, but it's been sort of my mantra whenever Madame Mania insists that I should go off the grid, selling needle felted tchotchkies and foraged mushrooms at farmers' markets.

Those kinds of concessions don't halt science, but they do show respect and consideration.

With the Karen scenario... I don't really know what to say beyond crazy people gonna crazy. Her stance isn't representative of a sizeable chunk of people and there's nothing to show that anything would be irrevocably destroyed by going against her wishes.

It's a lot easier for a neurotypical person to extend their empathy to depression because it's close to something most people have felt. To them, it's double plus sad. They can digest it.

Mania on the other hand is something different and scary and person-consuming... ""That's what happened to Charlie Sheen. Remember? He had tiger blood. It was like he was on all the drugs. And, wait, wasn't he on drugs too? That bipolar is scary stuff. Scary. I can't even imagine...""

PowerShell,fptw43g,t3_gfis55,1588899448.0,"I've noticed odd behavior with `[pscustomobject[]]` arrays, too. The most effective way to force them to behave I've found is just to hard cast the array, and hard cast as I add to it to keep them full objects and not  hashtables:

    [pscustomobject[]] $myArray = @()
    $myarray += [pscustomobject]@{
        ItemName = 'Item1';
        PropertyOne = 'ValueForProperty1';
        PropertyTwo = 'ValueForProperty2'
    }

    -----------       -----------       --------
    ValueForProperty1 ValueForProperty2 Item0
    ValueForProperty1 ValueForProperty2 Item1   

As for creating the default output properties in tables, there's a cool method of doing that by setting your object as a type. Here's a pretty old article going into that method in detail:  [https://learn-powershell.net/2013/08/03/quick-hits-set-the-default-property-display-in-powershell-on-custom-objects/](https://learn-powershell.net/2013/08/03/quick-hits-set-the-default-property-display-in-powershell-on-custom-objects/)

That said, there's probably a much nicer way to do it with classes these days if you'll be using the objects much more than on-the-fly... Going the class route though, you completely bypass the need for using the `pscustomobject` array.

Edit: I just reread and saw your requirement for the members to allow arrays. Using a class, you'd get past a lot of annoyance here, but you can do it with `pscustomobject` . If you're building these objects one at a time (as opposed to maybe pulling them in from a file or something), you could create the object and then `Add-Member` hard casting the member type as an array and setting the value:

    $myArray[0] | add-member -MemberType NoteProperty -Name ArrayMember -Value @('ArrayVal1','ArrayVal2')
    
    PS C:\> $myArray[0]
    
    PropertyOne       PropertyTwo       ItemName ArrayMember
    -----------       -----------       -------- -----------
    ValueForProperty1 ValueForProperty2 Item0    {ArrayVal1, ArrayVal2}

But you can do it in the hash, too, as long as you hard cast the array:

    $myarray += [pscustomobject]@{
        ItemName = 'Item1';
        PropertyOne = 'ValueForProperty1' ;
        PropertyTwo = 'ValueForProperty2' ;
        ArrayMember = @('ArrayVal1','ArrayVal2')
    }
    
    PS C:\> $myArray[2]
    
    ItemName PropertyOne       PropertyTwo       ArrayMember
    -------- -----------       -----------       -----------
    Item2    ValueForProperty1 ValueForProperty2 {ArrayVal1, ArrayVal2}

Two of the biggies that usually disqualify animal communication are generativity and displacement.

Generativity is being able to come up with new words for unknown concepts. Koko arguably showed this in naming her kittens (see my comment above). Kanzi (a bonobo also famous for his linguistic capacity) has been documented on several occasions combining signs he knows to create new signs for unfamiliar concepts.

Displacement is being able to talk about concepts that are removed from the present or current place. Being able to talk about things you WILL do in the future or things you HAVE done in the past shows linguistic complexity. A dog can bark to go to the park, but he can't bark to go to the park once it stops raining. There's a famous story about Koko having a favorite handler who was pregnant. The handler had told Koko that she was going to have a baby, and Koko was excited about the baby. The woman lost the pregnancy. The next time she saw Koko, Koko asked about the baby and was saddened by the loss. This event shows that she could ask about a hypothetical person and a removed location and time. There are less dramatic stories about Kanzi asking about scheduled meetings and interviews in the future.

These kinds of stories are well-documented, and they show a complexity and sophistication that greatly exceeds mimicry.

As for why language hasn't shown up in wild ape troops... We aren't watching every troop of apes. We do know that they  figure stuff out (like new tools) not infrequently and teach the receptive members of their communities. And we do know for sure that it happened at least once."

Another fun quirk with the history of English was something that happened during the Enlightenment. A whole bunch of upper-class English dudes decided that, because Latin and Greek were the peak of civilization, so were the languages Latin and Greek. They concluded any good language should be like Latin and Greek.

As a result, they imposed a whole bunch of prescriptive rules stripped from Latin and Greek onto English grammar that didn't really make sense in the new context.

A lot of these are those lame grammar rules your third grade teacher tried to hammer into your noggin:

- No Split Infinitives : eg. 'to boldly go'. You literally can't do this in Latin since infinitives, like 'to go', are single words. 
- No Hanging Prepositions : eg. 'What is the cat laying on?'. Again, you literally can't do this in Latin since position is shown with a case, not a word.

During that time, speaker of Old English frequently interacted (sure, that's a good word for it. Let's go with that.) with speakers of Old Norse, another Germanic language. The two were close enough to be more or less mutually intelligible with a good bit of gesturing and ear-squinting.

A common theory goes that the grammatical relaxation that would have happened as a result of those conversations caused English to ditch its tight grammar and instead show meaning and structure through word order.

In other words, English was fundamentally altered when a bunch of Vikings showed up and tried to talk with the Anglo-Saxons the best they could."
AskReddit,fjm5co6,t1_fjm3tr9,1583461982.0,"It's the case that changes. My example isn't a great one. Here's maybe a better one:

Jane slapped John.
Jane ran.

In English, Jane would be in the same case in both. John is in a different case.

In languages with a split ergative, the first Jane (the slapper) would be in a different case than the second Jane (the runner). Running Jane would be in the same case as slapped John.

Does that make more sense? It's weird to wrap your head around."

You is singular.  
Y'all is dual (2).  
All y'all is paucal (3+)."

In answering a question, you just use the verb for yes or not-the-verb for no.

Like! -or- Don't like!

Edit: verb. Not noun. Don't post half asleep, people."
AskReddit,fjlykgl,t3_fe2a6q,1583457475.0,"There's a family of languages, the caucasic languages, that have a really neat trait called a split ergative.

In languages that don't have this trait, like English, subjects in sentences with direct objects take the same case as subjects in sentences without direct objects.

Example:  
I slapped him.  
I slap.

The subject is both sentences, 'I', is in the same case.

In a split ergative language, subjects in sentences without direct objects take the same case as the direct object of a sentence with a direct object.

Example:  
I slapped him.  
Me slap."

I'm no lace expert, but if memory serves, some types that we consider lace aren't technically lace. The distinction has to do with whether the design is created by a single thread knotting and attaching to itself or by some other another mechanism.

Of course these kinds of distinctions are more or less just pedantry."

There are other foods that I'm not a fan of (lentils, whole chickpeas, lima beans, yogurt-based beverages... It's a texture thing usually), but nothing that I would special-order to remove if present in a dish. In other words, if l went to a restaurant that had a lentil dish, I probably wouldn't order it, but if I did, I wouldn't pick them out or anything. I just don't enjoy them very much.

But so help me God if I have to eat something covered in ketchup...

TwoXChromosomes,fhkgshb,t1_fhjzqn0,1581683042.0,"Also going through a wanted, planned pregnancy. I'm at about six weeks right now, and I found out about two weeks ago. I've always been pro-choice, but this has made me really resonate on the impacts of all the legislation some states keep forcing through.

When I found out, it was about as early as it possibly could be. I was anxiously marking days on the calendar when I could pee on a stick. And if that pregnancy was unwanted, depending on where I lived, I could be in a situation where I'd have two weeks to scrape together a few hundred bucks,  take off work, and drive possibly a few hundred miles on more than one occasion to end something that has a 25% chance of ending on its own anyway.

I've also been thinking more about later term procedures. Due to a few health issues, I have a heightened risk for a specific heart defect in my pregnancy. This heart defect is one that would result in a short, painful life in the NICU for the child after birth. It's not detectable for sure until 20 weeks. If that were to happen, my husband and I would have to make one of the hardest decisions of our marriage... And possibly have to do it despite significant legal obstacles and the shade and judgement of people who have never been faced with anything similar.

I wish pro-life people listened to more of these stories."
