If he's a homosexual, good for him I guess, but still haven't seen any proof, just assumption on your part. As for the company it seems more inclusive and diverse, which would mean it's more LGBTQ friendly, but that doesn't automatically mean it's an LGBTQ company,  it just means it's not going to exclude them. I seriously doubt their business plan is to completely ditch any and all possible consumers who don't fall on that spectrum. Just the closed minded ones.

Ignoring all games that feature such diversity/inclusivity is just going to be harder and harder from this point onwards though, keep that in mind.

Therapy has been on my mind, however it will have to wait, since during my last major ""episode"" I ended up losing my job (and more importantly, insurance). The new job is still in the new hire phase which means no benefits. 

I think you're right with the seeking validation part, as one of the things a former friend told me was that I was too much of a ""people pleaser'' and that it got really annoying and at times made em uncomfortable.
