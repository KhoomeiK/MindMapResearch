Anxiety,fogd7h3,t3_g7al6m,1587751077.0,"I’ve dealt with not sleeping because of anxiety for most of my life, but I think I’ve figured it out, a bit, at least for me. I’ve found I really need to tire my body out a bit during the day, practice at least a little sleep hygiene (make the bed, if I want to be in bed I can have a throw blanket and sit on top of the other blankets, it sounds silly but after a bit your body sort of realizes the heavier weight of blankets means sleep and I get more tired when I finally crawl under them), I like to also have water and saltines by my bed and my phone, and anything I might need if I have really bad anxiety, it’s sort of comforting to know if it gets bad there’s stuff to help in arms reach, I tried “bedtime” yoga on YouTube and it seemed to help, I also try not to indulge in any media in the evening that can trigger anxiety in any way, sometimes even just old cartoons can be a nice break, I like to light incense because the smell can be sorta nice, maybe there’s some fragrance that you find soothing? Another thing I’ve found is setting up for the next day so I can’t be over analyzing what needs to be done (even if that’s just tidy up a little) and showering before bed. You said podcasts haven’t been helping you a ton, so you might have already heard of these but these have been saving me from sleepless nights, my favorites are Sleepy (stories read out loud), Tracks to Relax (a meditation sleep podcast) and my favorite, Get Sleepy (a little bit of mindfulness and a guided story, if you really let it in it can feel like a little adventure as you fall asleep). All that being said, maybe try to do some extra self care during the day, it’s good to be mindful of where your head is at and what you need. I hope this helps even a little, I hope you find something that works for you! Good luck!"

When my little brother turned the light on I was surprised to find they were riffles I was sitting on. (We live in the middle of nowhere so Dad kept them for protection against break ins and bears)"

Advice,fioj8jr,t3_f8zloq,1582584386.0,"Do things that give you any bit of positive feeling at all, even if it’s really stupid. Push yourself to get outside, sunlight is very good for you and it physically removes your body from where you’ve been. I find what has helped me most is to focus on all the positive little things, make a point to. Like if you decide to go for a walk, make notes in your head like the fresh air feels food on your lungs, the smell is nice, you saw a dog, whatever it takes, after a while it might start to encourage slightly happier thoughts. Do LOTS of self care, anything that feels like a treat, do it, chances are you deserve it. For me looking up quotes can help my head. Also make sure to reach out to friends and family, even if it’s a little uncomfortable, make a point to try to talk or hangout, just to get you out of your head. My professor said this to the class a few weeks ago, that really helped me, “be willing to be patient with yourself.” I hope this helps, reach out to professionals if you need to, sometimes some counselors just don’t mesh with you and that’s okay, but somebody out there will. Don’t give up!"
