Either take a historical map and make it like it is or make up a map that’s inspired by a historical place, then you can add things to it as they see fit.

Also tanks are meant for longer ranges, especially top tier. Imo there should be a higher chance of getting a large map, the higher br vehicle you play. Map preference is a hard thing to balance though, some want those small brawl maps, some want larger snipe maps."

After reading this I’m honestly in fucking tears, and I never cry,ever. Words simply can’t describe what you are going through. I know word don’t mean much right now, or for a while, if ever. 

The world really is cruel and unfair, but I’m glad that you guys knew how much you loved each other like you said in the post. I personally have never experienced anything remotely like this but what I did experience was loosing my father in a car accident in 2012 (I was 13, now 22m). Now, the comparison here is thin, as what you have gone through is a thousand times worse, but the loss of a loved is indescribable. If like a part of your soul is forever lost with them, and the hole left will never be filled, no matter what. 

There is so many emissions running through your head, sadness,anger, disbelief and I even started to laugh because I didn’t believe it, and just thought I’d was a sick joke or something. How one reacts and acts after such an event is very individual, but for me it was important to get my mind of it initially, so my half brother showed me some yt videos after We got back for the hospital. In the following days the mind wanders, thinking of “what if’s” and such, I assume the same thing is with you, but it’s important to try to not beat yourself up with these thoughts because the hard cold truth is that person is now forever gone, and there is unfortunately nothing one can do.

And the hard truth is that life move on, whether you like it or not. I know it sound harsh but that’s the reality. And it’s about trying to find a way to move on, not matter how hard it is and no matter how hard you try to resist. I can only speak from my experience and situation, but trying to get some normalcy was and I think is important. I was 3-4 weeks home before I went back to school,the time spent home was used to get my mind off of it by watching movies and playing games etc. I don’t remember correctly but I don’t think I spoke to any of my friends during that time. 

Going back to any kind of normalcy is hard, weird and awkward. Naturally people didn’t know how to act and be around me initially. I felt like everyone was looking at me as I walked in, and I felt their pity full eyes. It was weird, not gonna lie. There is this weird energy because everyone is trying to act different around you because “you’re the kid who lost his father” but I just wanted them to act as usual, and I so desperately wanted to go home but I powered through it, day after day, and luckily and eventually it went back to a “normalcy”.

I also end up going to a group grief counseling. Where there was 6 other kids (13-18) who had lost a loved one to an accident or a disease. This luckily did help me and my process to somewhat understand and accept my loss. It also weirdly helped to listen to these other people around your age and they had similar situations. Idk why but it did, hopefully that’s something you could try to seek out but it’s an individual thing so it’s not going to help with everyone. Also, initially I didn’t wanna go the first few times, but I kept giving it another try, and another etc. I guess it’s because it nice to talk to someone that understands your situation and such.


“Time heals” sounds corny, dumb, bs but I think it does. Filling in this time with ways to cope with the loss is also important. Finding something that works for you, might be hard, take time, but eventually you’ll get there. Going away to Ireland like you said might be good and something that will help in your road to recovery. I’ve had nightmares, felt the world is unfair, and suicidal tendencies, but the feelings I’ve experienced with this is not something I would want anyone to go through and experience. I don’t know you and your girlfriend but I know that from reading what you have said about her, she would want you go on with your life. Live the life she never got. It fucking hard, but you’ll get there. Moving on is difficult but a necessary step, it not something that needs to be rushed but a little step at a time when you are ready.

I really really hope that you find a way that works with you to find peace, normalcy, coping with loss and I hope that one day you can be at peace. No matter what, she will always be in you heart and be with you. Best wishes to you, your family and hers. And may you have a long and beautiful life when you are ready for it.

You can be lucky and get one after 5 matches or after 50. The drops are random and you need luck. Also you can only get drops if you win the match, so the more you win the better are the chances of getting something.
