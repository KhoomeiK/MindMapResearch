Over detailed: I think my fav character is definitely Steven for sure, because of many things. First reason is because of his character change over the seasons. He was such a nice innocent boi at the beginning, but wow, he turned angsty. Secondly, he was always an amazing kid who would always help someone. I feel like he would help a therapist with their problems instead of vice versa. Lastly, he has been a great character throughout the seasons, always willing to go on adventures. I admire his bravery to do things honestly. Those are why I think Steven is a great character in the series!"

Overly detailed: I can't really give you a clear answer there, since I don't really stick to just one artist. A thing I have found out though is that most of the songs I listen to are pretty angsty or sad, so you can already tell a lot by that lol. Some days I feel like sad calm music does the trick, other times I like sad songs that is pretty much heavy metal. But to basically tie it all together, I would say that NF is the artist I listen to the most"

Overly Detailed: Oh of course, I've played many other games. A couple that were my favorite was Undertale, and Splatoon 2. I don't play them anymore, since I got bored with them pretty quickly. A game I do play time to time though is Super Smash bros, and Mario Kart. I like Super Smash bro's because Kirby is the sh*t for me, and I can defeat my brother pretty easily. I also have fun doing the little missions in it as well. For Mario Kart, I like all the little powers that you get, and also the adrenaline of trying to get 1st place. So yes, there are many games that I have tried, but those are the ones that has stuck to me."
AMA,fqankdn,t1_fqamy3d,1589222097.0,"Overly simple: It's Rocket League

Overly detailed: Personally for me, my favorite video game is one generally about soccer with boosting cars, called Rocket League. The reasoning behind this is because one, it's extremely fun. There are many settings to change it to, like different team sizes, or even the arena, so you could do basketball, hockey, and more. Secondly, it's online, so you could play with your friends instead of just bots. Thirdly, there are private matches that you can make. In those, you can share the name and password with someone you know, so you're not playing with a stranger. Overall, it's a good game to test out your speed skills, power, your ability to block, and so much more."
