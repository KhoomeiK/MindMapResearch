literature,f31ol3j,t3_df8m60,1570580705.0,"I think the committee is looking to do a lot of damage control and are primarily patching up their reputation this year. So one of the winners will most definitely be a female, perhaps one who primarily writes in a language other than English. 

Maryse Conde is a good bet. She won the alternative Nobel Prize last year. Probably won't be Anne Carson because Alice Munro, another Canadian female, just won not too long ago. Can Xue, an experimental Chinese writer, is still relatively young but I wouldn't be too surprised with her winning. Yoko Tawada is up there floating among the rumors. Other female authors: I would not be too surprised if Ulitskaya, Tokarczuk, or Marilynne Robinson won. 

I would also think that the second pick will be probably a conventional male European author. They might go for the safe fallback choice since there's going to be two picks this year, and they can afford to be two-sided about it as long as one is a female. Dylan won not too long ago, and even picking a songwriter was controversial enough, but an *American* songwriter really was something else. So that leads me to believe the American crowd isn't going to have a lot of luck this year but will have to wait. That's a shame, because Pynchon, Delillo, and McCarthy aren't getting any younger. 

Out of others in the mix: I would be very pleasantly surprised if Murakami won this year. I would also be very pleasantly surprised if Milan Kundera finally won. The dude's like 90 now and has been a forever contender. You could make the argument that The Unbearable Lightness of Being alone warrants the reward. I don't think Ismail Kadare is going to get it anytime soon. Adonis was ""supposed"" to win that one year, but Orhan Palmuk was chosen as the middle-eastern recipient instead. He is also up there as the forever contender of poets. Ngugi Thiong'o is honestly a pretty good bet, because Africa hasn't had a winner in a long long time."

SuicideWatch,eysd1yg,t1_eyptzty,1567394167.0,"I love Murakami as well! I haven't read Wind Up Bird, but I've read Tuesday's Women, all of his short stories, 1Q84, and his essay work on modern Japanese society. He is perhaps one of the top pre-eminent literature thinkers who, in my mind, deserves the Nobel Prize. He's been nominated pretty much every year or so for decades, is what I've heard. 

And I think you have deep insight into his works. You are very right. Murakami's central themes are about navigating the surreal and often absurdist nature of everyday living. He writes about people who are fundamentally disconnected with society, but who preserver nevertheless when faced with such unfair chance. I think maybe you like his stories because of how oddly relative they are to the reader. Murakami's books may be surreal in nature as you described, but the feelings of angst, anxiety, separation, and isolation are undeniably universally shared themes that many of his audiences connect with so personally. I recently read some essays analyzing his stories with Jungian and Freudian psychological archetypes, and why his characters ""click"" with us so perfectly. At the end of the day we're all human, all built from the same flawed mould.

And I think your life may be along the lines of what you described by his stories. Your life may seem surreal now. It may seem existentially dark. You may be in a very dark place and feel as if you're isolated from the rest of the world. But just like his stories, there's always a silver lining. There's always an ending that arrives at a truly better tomorrow. And the majority of his characters do come out stronger than when such a crisis began. Murakami likes portraying characters in a modern-day subtle-ized Athenian tragedy, often in suburban and eventless environments, and then having them rely on their own resolve and willpower to overcome their struggles. Just like one of his stories, your story is not over my friend. Keep fighting the good fight. Keep reaching past the illusions of fear and self-doubt into your own better tomorrow. Your story is not over, and it does not have to end abruptly like this.

I'm so glad books give you comfort, and I'm so glad my messages may have helped in some way. If you ever want to talk, I'm here for ya.

SuicideWatch,eyn35rc,t3_cxrt9y,1567229406.0,"I was bullied as well growing up. It certainly does leave a mark, but with time it certainly wore away and had the potential to make me stronger mentally and also physically. 

You said your life is at rock bottom. Theoretically if it truly is, doesn't this mean there's no where to go but up? So in that case, there's a lot more upside than downside at this point. Why leave if there's so much to be gained or that can pick back up and turn around? If life turned down that quickly, it may just as easily turn back around back to ""on the right track"" just as quickly. It may not seem like that now in the thicket of the present, but life can surprise us when we least expect it.

SuicideWatch,eyn2hcy,t1_eyn1zgj,1567228626.0,"I actually used to fantasize about the same dreams. That I was successful and super rich and was a world famous novelist or songwriter or music producer. Daydreams was what I got.

What kind of music are you mainly into? Hip hop? Other genres too? You sound like you might have potential/talent if you have a lot of passion for this field. I think it might be a good idea to give it a shot if you really have nothing to lose. Why not express yourself on the mic and just say fuck it and create the music you want to hear, if you're already at this point? I think it's worth a chance. Art gives us hope. Music personally gave me life in my darkest moments. It just might do the same for you :)"

SuicideWatch,eyn2a77,t3_cxk1ap,1567228403.0,I feel like these feelings may be worsened by sleep exhaustion. Are you still awake? I would say get some hours of rest and then your mental state would be more clear.

SuicideWatch,eyn20sf,t3_cxo5dm,1567228111.0,"I used to have full on panic disorder. I used to have panic attacks every day at school, in public, combined with agoraphobia. Believe me ,I know how much of a hell it feels.

One thing that worked for me was meditation combined with therapy and meds. Have you talked to a doctor about this? There are breathing, cognitive, and exposure exercises out there that helped me solve this problem. Exposure works by facing the symptoms full on and seeing through their bluff as just what you mentioned - a fight or flight response. 

If you want, reach out to me and I can provide you with some resources that helped me conquer my own panic disorder. I have several books on the psychology/treatment behind it and also a couple on breathing meditation which practice helped me TREMENDOUSLY (Soto Zen sitting meditation). 

So sorry to hear about your situation, I know how very bad it feels. For me it was like suffocating. But there is a way past this :).

Often times we are our own harshest critics and judge ourselves by these high-up standards. We're all human at the end of the day. One thing I learned is it's okay to be vulnerable, we don't have to be perfect.

Sorry to hear things have been going rough, my friend. Could you plan a family dinner or some small picnic, a vacation day to somewhere fun? Or even if it's with some buddies or friends you haven't seen in awhile? Honestly, sometimes a simple distraction or a breather is all we need to get regain a sense of normality. I also want to thank you for the advice you gave me in the chat message. I go through my own issues too in that department (lonely, no gf, etc), but I appreciate it, man. I saw your posts on the advice forum and how you're always looking out for others. I think you are far from a failure. You've helped so many people, including me. I appreciate it so much.
