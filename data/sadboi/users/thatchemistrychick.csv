aggies,fnikqf8,t3_g1dt1l,1586981688.0,"Congratulations and welcome to Aggieland!! As others have said, we're a 90 minute to 3 hour drive from several major cities. BCS is a bigger area than I initially thought, and there's plenty to do when not sheltering in place. Like u/Guiltyjerk said, I would avoid the rec at all costs and find a small local gym if you like to workout. My apartment complex has a pretty nice workout set up, so I honestly just work out there and also run or walk at the several local parks (I'm fond of Lick Creek Park and Stephen C. Beachy Park).

There are a lot of great restaurants in town! Some of my favorites include Mad Taco, C+J Barbecue, and Burger Mojo (all are doing take out now given the circumstances). Also H-E-B is a fabulous grocery store and has been a leader in instituting policies to protect customers and employees during this time. Once the world no longer has gone to hell, there are also a lot of cool bars and breweries in the area. Blackwater Draw is a brewery in Bryan that's got pretty good beer, and if you're looking for a dive bar that isn't overrun by undergrads, I recommend Duddley's Draw at Northgate near campus.

I moved down here last year from Ohio, and I have to say do enjoy living here. Campus is a 20 minute drive from my apartment (at a maximum - usually it's more 10ish minutes), parking is reasonable relatively speaking, and it's easy to get around campus (there's the Aggieland spirit buses if you don't want to drive). Plus, whenever we get football back, the tailgates and games are a lot of fun!

I also agree that Dr. Lutkenhaus is really nice."

aggies,fmq70j2,t3_fwpjdw,1586294052.0,"I'm on the graduate student health insurance through the chemistry department (since November 1st), and I've been pretty impressed with it thus far. I've also been impressed enough that I will be adding the dental and vision insurance during open enrollment in July. 

To speak to mental health, it does cover it! Outpatient mental health services (e.g. seeing a psychiatrist or a therapist) have a $35 copay, and you pay 20% of any in-patient services (which need preauthorization). You don't need preauthorization to go see a therapist, and it's basically $35/office visit."

aggies,fkvqd4p,t1_fkvjnvr,1584574527.0,"No offense, but stuff like this is why they are closing down the bars and in person dining at restaurants. You're part of the problem, not the solution.

GradSchool,fkru9k6,t1_fkranro,1584476153.0,"I agree! Document EVERYTHING, and you can at least voice your concerns with the department (and then consider lawyering up). I think they'd have to take it pretty seriously if he is being inconsiderate to a student with a medical condition beyond their control (yay genetics). It's really upsetting that he wouldn't take you seriously considering the whole ""preexisting condition"" thing. Like you said, sure, you only have 4 people in your research group, but it is a SHARED SPACE. It's incredibly hard to disinfect a whole lab regularly, so it doesn't matter how small your group is, you're still susceptible from everyone else passing through. Hang in there!"

aggies,fggpj2d,t1_fggnqv3,1580766743.0,"What u/Guiltyjerk said. There are TAs in HELD 406 from 8 am to 6 pm M-W and 8 am to 5 pm on Fridays. We're happy to help explain DRAs and what is expected. I agree that more time could be devoted to teaching scientific writing, but it sounds like that will be changing in the coming years. Right now there is a space issue (number of lab classrooms vs total number of students enrolled in lab courses), but this should get better with the expansion into the 2nd floor of HELD and the new West campus building.

Yes, there is variance in TAs, but the program is working to make it better. We do see your PICA comments, so being providing thoughtful feedback and constructive criticism is very helpful! I know for a fact Dr. Lee (and the new lab coordinator Dr. Altemose) want to give students the best possible experience, so these evaluations help. Also reach out to your TA if you're struggling - that's what we're here for. TAs want to see their students do well, and your TA can best help you if you communicate with them.

I'd also like to call BS on the ""accuracy of results"" comment. In a quantitative analysis lab, yes it matters. But in the FYP, they care more that you can analyze your data and perform the necessary calculations than getting a 100% accurate result.

I'll get off my soapbox now, but the best way to improve the chemistry FYP is to provide the thoughtful feedback u/Guiltyjerk mentions on PICA and the best way to get the most out of your FYP chemistry lab is to communicate with your TA."

Ohio,fbtev8a,t1_fbt40vv,1577076518.0,"Came here to say this. Grew up in Ohio, live in Texas now and saw these signs on my way to the airport to come home for Christmas. Still made me giggle as I drove past them though!!"
aggies,fb5z8c3,t3_ebi6sg,1576537480.0,"Ok so current grad student here, but I experienced both scenarios (small, ""prestigious"", private liberal arts school and big state school) on the path to my undergrad degree. I started at the small, private college and then transferred to the big state school for the start of my junior year. Here's my two cents:

1) From my experience, the small school felt A LOT like high school all over again (i.e. everybody kind of knowing everybody's' business). This was one of the reasons I eventually transferred out - it was very clique-y, and for a school that was supposed to not be ""party focused"" I found it to be quite the opposite. Also it's a college campus - no matter which you choose there will be partying/noise and generally it's pretty easy to avoid it.

2) I had a much better time at the state school than the private school simply because there was more to do outside of classes. It was easier to find my niche because there was more diversity in the student organizations and the things to do on/near campus.

3) Rankings really don't matter unless it's like an Ivy. If you choose to go to graduate school, then the ranking of the graduate program you choose matters more. But your undergrad ranking? Not so much. The private school was higher ""ranked"" than the state school I graduated from, but I still was admitted to the three top 50 graduate programs I applied to with my public university degree, for what it's worth.

4) It's ultimately what you do while you're in college that matters most, not really where you went. I got involved in research, was a peer tutor, volunteered, and held an on-campus job. Employers want to see a well rounded applicant - both in the classes you took and what you did outside of the classroom. You can accomplish this at either school.

5) The Aggie network is real - it feels like every time I wear TAMU gear outside of Bryan/College Station I run into another Aggie. This has happened in my hometown (which is in the north midwest) and on my family vacation in Colorado (twice in one day in Breckenridge). They're always super friendly and eager to make the connection, which definitely helps in the job search.

Sorry for the wall of text, but hopefully this helps a little! The TL/DR is it really doesn't matter which school you go to, what matters is which one will make you happiest/is a better fit for you (not your parents). Go to whatever school gives you the best ""feeling."" Good luck!"

GradSchool,f8t0zxk,t3_e1xe0n,1574793450.0,"I feel this so hard. I'm a third year chemistry PhD student who was supposed to be done with classes by now, but because my advisor changed institutions I have to take one more damn class solely to establish a GPA at the new institution. What frustrates me the most is that the class is a major time suck and kicking my ass because there simply aren't enough hours in the day to cover all my teaching responsibilities, be productive in lab, and devote enough time for this class (which has had 7 group homework assignments so far with randomly assigned groups, and the prof is still going to push one more group assignment out even though #7 is due Monday and the semester ends a week later)."

I‚Äôm across the country from my boyfriend (my PhD advisor took a position at another university at the end of my second year), and we do this to a tee. It also helps that he‚Äôs a young attorney, so the distance gives both of us time to focus on our work so that we can hopefully be more established by the time I‚Äôm finished with my degree and we‚Äôre both under the same roof.
