I decided that I can‚Äôt continue with this medication because it‚Äôs unsafe. The highs put me at risk for making awful decisions and hurting people with my words or impatience.

That‚Äôs been really helpful. 
And thank you! I‚Äôve been working hard to get a routine down and keep it nice and healthy. :)"
Wavyhair,fj5p6ts,t3_fbp0o2,1583038651.0,"Routine:
Every other wash day I do a pre-shampoo oil treatment or deep conditioner. I like the one by Amika in the orange packaging. Usually let it sit for an hour or so.

Wash with Carols Daughter Cactus and rose water shampoo. Condition with Carols daughter Fresh Greens conditioner.

Use lots of water and conditioner to detangle with a wet hair brush. 

I put my leave in products on soaking wet hair. That‚Äôs key for me. 

I use a denman brush to create clumps. Then I smooth  the Not Your Mother‚Äôs curl cream over the clumps and scrunch.  I avoid my roots. 

The next step has been the game changer ! Strong hold gel is my best friend now. I was afraid of it before because I didn‚Äôt want hard and dry hair. I use the La looks Wet look gel with level 10 hold. I smooth a generous amount of gel from roots to the ends and then scrunch

After all that I usually scrunch more with my hair towel and let it air dry. I just started root clipping +plopping and it has made a difference. Once it‚Äôs about 80% dry I take it out of the plop and let it finish drying. I usually toss my hair from side to side while drying. It helps me get more volume.

For reference I have very fine hair but a lot of it. I believe I am low porosity. I get very oily roots and dry ends. This is also my virgin hair."
Wavyhair,finrnkx,t1_finamsr,1582568858.0,Which products? I have the same hair as you pretty much except it‚Äôs not dyed. I use the NYM curltalk mousse instead of the gel or cream because it‚Äôs lighter and has good hold. Maybe a deep conditioning treatment would help?
HaircareScience,fig3p5u,t1_fig0azg,1582395795.0,Yeah I mix it with olive oil or sunflower seed oil. Both help with the stickiness and consistency. I start at my roots and slowly work it down to my ends. I keep it mostly on the roots though. Another thing I have had some success with is taking silica supplements. It seems to be helping my hair thicken and grow.  I get acne from biotin supplements so the silica is great! Makes my nails stronger too.

Routine: 

Wash and condition with Carols Daughter Cactus Rosewater shampoo and conditioner. ( both Silicone free and sulfate free.

No leave in conditioner because it makes my hair heavy and squishy like wet seaweed

I use a mouse gel mousse technique with kinky curly custard and cake beauty curl whip mousse. 

I put on all of my products while my hair is soaking wet. I divide in medium size sections and scrunch a lot. After each clump is scrunched I then scrunch one more time with a microfiber towel. I plop until it‚Äôs 70% dry and then defuse on low heat upside down until it‚Äôs dry. 

Finally I spray in OGX tousle mist and then fluff my waves for more volume. Love this stuff!

My hair is oily at the roots, bone dry at the ends, tangles so bad at the nape of the neck. I have had to chop of knots that were so matted I couldn‚Äôt get a comb or conditioner through it. My hair is fragile and verryyy fine.

Night time routine:

1. Double cleanse with Cerave foaming cleanser for normal to oily skin
2. I apply my skin and co truffle toner 
3 once the toner has dried I apply Cerave Retinol serum. It glides on like a dream and I love the way my skin feel after. I noticed this helping with both scars and redness.
3. Apply Cerave eye cream- 
4. Apply  night cream. I use the super green gel cream from Walmart. It does have a scent but so far it has not irritated my skin. It‚Äôs nice and light. Make my skin feel firm and plump !

Morning routine:

1. Cleanse  with the Cerave foaming cleanser 
2 apply retinol - I skip toner because I‚Äôm lazy af in the morning 
3. Then I slather on a bunch of the Cerve AM moisturizer. This one in particular has spf and gives a matte finish. So far I can only find the matte one on amazon. Drugstores near me only have the regular am moisturizer. 

That‚Äôs it! Then I will usually follow up with a spray primer and this awesome matte foundation from amazon. 

This is the clearest I have ever seen my skin. I‚Äôm a 28F and for once I do not have acne except for hormonal acne around my periods.  I mainly buy products that are budget friendly

I know you said that she‚Äôs been tested for stuff but maybe she needs to see someone for a second opinion. Maybe try vocational rehab? I had a job coach and did vocational rehab and it made such a difference! 

I would let her figure stuff out for herself. She‚Äôs old enough to make her own decisions. Maybe you could have told her that she could be successful as long as she puts in the effort.

Cutting out Sulfates helped with oil production. I used to have to wash my hair every morning but now I wash it every 4 days! 

For products I use Carols Daughter Cactus and rose water shampoo and conditioner. I use light stylers like alcohol free mousse or gel. I like Cake Beauty Curl whip or any volumizing mousse. 

Leave in conditioner sprays tend to be lighter and less heavy. I use Milkshake Leave in spray on the length of my hair. It smells like frosting!!! 

I also love using clay based masks. There‚Äôs one by Yes to Blueberries that comes in a single foil pack. I found it at right aid in the natural beauty section. 

Limit any conditioner ( deep conditioner, regular conditioner and leave in conditioner)  to just the length of your hair . 

Clarify once a week or once every two weeks with clarifying shampoo. I like the one by neutrogena. 
I see you got a scalp scrub. I use scalp scrub before a clarifying shampoo and my scalp feels so good after! I make my own scrub with coconut sugar, a few drops of argan oil and mix it into shampoo. The coconut sugar is gentle and the shampoo part helps to distribute it.

I distribute the mixture through  my hair and my scalp. I then put all of my hair in a shower cap and put my turbie twist towel on top. The combo of the shower cap and towel keeps my scalp warm and makes it easier for the mixture to penetrate.

I usually do this on my day off when I‚Äôll be watching Netflix or cleaning my apartment. I‚Äôll keep the mask in while I‚Äôm doing those things. I personally leave it in for a couple of hours or more.

endometriosis,fg3e4ae,t3_ewiiy1,1580479144.0,"I had the surgery and they did find something. They biopsied some inflamed tissue from the left side of my uterus. 
The biopsy came back inconclusive. Which she didn‚Äôt tell me for a whole year. She kept telling me it‚Äôs endo but I had an appt a couple of days ago and she said that she‚Äôs not sure what I have and put me on Lupron. She also suggested a hysterectomy. She‚Äôs DOESNT even know what she‚Äôs treating!
For me personally surgery didn‚Äôt change anything."

femalehairadvice,fg1ajyr,t3_ewa3m1,1580423739.0,Dry texture spray is really helpful for getting more volume in fine hair!
Endo,fg11dy0,t1_fg0j4zg,1580418995.0,Thank you for sharing! It makes me feel a little bit better. My doctor said that she would  add back progesterone to help with side effects if I need it.

BipolarReddit,ffohbu7,t1_ffodgy0,1580077643.0,Our healthcare system is so flawed. I see patients going without psych meds or insulin because their insurance won‚Äôt cover it. It‚Äôs awful. I hate when I am unable to help them :(
Wavyhair,ffogzbp,t3_eud3om,1580077544.0,We have a similar texture. What products do you use?
Wavyhair,ffo1ocq,t1_ffnu1h1,1580073245.0,Oh I‚Äôm sorry I meant protein in the hair products .  Like soy/ rice protein for example .
Wavyhair,ffntmu3,t3_euc11k,1580070651.0,"I have similar issues. I have 2b/2c hair and it‚Äôs really fine. The roots get oily after 24 hours. I would stick with a sulfate free shampoo that is silicone and protein free. Sometimes if you have too much protein it can make the hair dry, frizzy and less defined. At least that has been my experience. It‚Äôs hard to have combo hair"
CongratsLikeImFive,ffna8lu,t3_eu1t0i,1580063603.0,Congratulations! I have EDNOS and it‚Äôs been a struggle lately. Seeing ED victories is so positive and motivating. Happy recovery!
Wavyhair,ffmp6wj,t1_ffj3zvj,1580057445.0,Thank you ! :)
BipolarReddit,ffmomfa,t1_ffj9ara,1580057321.0,"Yes, I believe so unfortunately. Most of my patients that receive help from the state don‚Äôt qualify for savings cards"
Wavyhair,ffmo8t3,t1_ffjkmu0,1580057226.0,I can get day 2 hair usually. I use texture powder spray to give more volume to the roots. Just my roots get flat.
longhair,ffj2sdf,t3_etrxgo,1579988947.0,"My hair looks like this too, just with some tighter waves on the top layer. I like the messy look. I think it‚Äôs nice. I wear my wavy hair beachy/messy and I love it! 
Maybe some shorter layers in the crown area would give it more shape? 
Honestly tho, I think your hair looks good  and tousled ."
BipolarReddit,ffixcsk,t3_etpqr5,1579985022.0,Hi! I‚Äôm on vraylar too and I work in a pharmacy. If you haven‚Äôt done a PA yet I highly suggest asking your pharmacy to start the process and send the  paperwork over to your doctor. Also calling your insurance company can help too. I wonder why you are not eligible for the savings card tho... so do you get any kind of help from the state? Sometimes that makes it so you can‚Äôt use the savings card. I‚Äôm sorry this is happening to you. If I find something I‚Äôll post on here. I work more on the clinical side of our pharmacy so I‚Äôm not 100% knowledgeable on insurance stuff.
Wavyhair,ffimi9w,t1_ffiiu4g,1579977428.0,I bought the Curl Whip from Cake Beauty. It‚Äôs really nice and light! I apply it root to tip and it doesn‚Äôt weigh my hair down. It‚Äôs not drying either. I am slightly panicking though because my Rite Aid got rid of it . I believe it is CG friendly
Wavyhair,ffi6m6d,t1_fe8le4c,1579966466.0,Tried mousse! Game changer!
Wavyhair,ffi646l,t3_etnejt,1579966092.0,"I use Carols Daughter Black Vanilla which has silicones  and it has loosened up my curl pattern, but just the bottom layer. I don‚Äôt really mind it because it‚Äôs like natural beachy waves. 
Silicones do weigh the hair down though. The heaviness is probably causing your pattern to loosen up. If you want a tighter texture then silicone free products are your best bet."
