But to get there, you have to play the ""fire node"" track in all 4 environments (highlands, forest, canyon, and peaks). When you complete a fire node track, the boss track (has a big difficult obstacle at the end) will spawn a flaming hoop to jump through.  Successfully jumping through the hoop and landing will grant the ""Fireball!"" trick.

Get a ""Fireball!"" on all 4 environments IN ONE RUN (not one life, just don't fail out to the menu or you'll have to restart) and when you finish the peaks boss level, you'll be taken to the volcano.

My advice is to get the navigator crew perk that allows you to scout further nodes on the map so you can find the fire nodes (and the bonus levels) from each environment.
