misophonia,fkjohdy,t1_fkjacye,1584252869.0,"hi! they arent dumb questions, i felt the same way before i started. the hypnosis isnt like what you see on tv or in movies, its more like you just relax (and the therapist will give you relaxing affirmations) and you are conscious and aware of whats going on, but you just feel so relaxed you dont want to resist anything. the therapist tells you affirmations about living a life without misophonia, being free from anxiety, embracing happiness, triggers not bothering you, etc... and since the affirmations are going to your subconscious mind, they really do come true! it seems crazy but i was blown away after one session. if you can i would definitely try it!"

misophonia,fkj5x8j,t1_fkixyg1,1584237041.0,"not a dumb question! basically you sit and close tour eyes and the therapist will talk about living a life without misophonia, being unbothered by triggers, not having anxiety/panic attacks, etc...
