ADHD,fp1sao7,t3_gatv0i,1588246290.0,I can chat! I have problems too. I find I really have no interest in talking to anybody who doesn’t engage me. I won’t even bother. I have a select few people I like and will talk to.
ADHD,fp1r694,t3_gatmsg,1588245252.0,"If you have a negative narrative in your head convincing yourself that you won’t/can’t do certain things, then it will most certainly come true. Bribe your mind with positive reinforcements to do your work, try not to succumb to the negativity."

Lauren is flying under the radar bc Al gives her no air-time but she is amazing. Look at her most recent vid on her fb page... she is on par w Adele."

entp,fl3yxgj,t3_fmdu04,1584801951.0,"I think it really depends on context here. To what are you referring to? The answer is different depending on the nature of your question, I think. Generally speaking, I feel like more people experience or focus on ""hate"" and negative emotions more frequently than love, which may make it appear stronger. However, think that love in its' instances is stronger or equal to hate."

adultsurvivors,fkpjvov,t3_fjxaxd,1584411896.0,"Truthfully, it was rape no matter what you said or didn’t say. Do not feel any shame in what you asked or said as a nine year old who was being taken advantage of. You could have said anything under the sun and it would not warrant anything that happened to you. I know it is tough, but try to affirm yourself that none of that is your fault. It is hard to think about, for sure. But know that you were not at fault here and the guilt for what was done and the severity of it does not fall on you."
entp,fkpj82w,t1_fkpijjl,1584411442.0,"I don't live with him. Yeah, I reckon you are right. It is extremely bizarre to me though because he has been relatively financially independent for a very long time as his mother could not provide for him in his late teens but in other ways, such as this, it seems he is very dependent. I don't understand. I think it may be that he is honestly just content now and doesn't care so much for improvement."
entp,fkphjje,t1_fkph86s,1584410311.0,"Very true. I was asking him about it the other day and the conclusion I took from the conversation was that he was not particularly happy but also not particularly unhappy. He is stressed about finances, which I do not knock him for as it happens to everyone, but simultaneously he is working a job that doesn’t have a high wage that I know he is capable of achieving. It seems like it is laziness more than anything but I will ask him again and try and dig a little deeper about his well-being."
entp,fkph39q,t1_fkpgxj0,1584410007.0,"He apparently doesn’t have the money for a gym membership.. lol. He’s not much of a reader, either. I am going to try and instigate some sort of stimulating activity for us though, I think that will help. If it doesn’t, at least it will provide clarity for me."
entp,fkpgs1l,t1_fkpgexz,1584409795.0,"That is very good advice, thank you very much. Literally any ounce of self-improvement would be great. I don’t really know where to start, though?"
entp,fkpg6jj,t1_fkoem2h,1584409386.0,"For sure, I definitely don’t have an understating of that experience because I’m not there yet. Thanks for sharing that perspective. I guess my issue is that he isn’t even trying for what he says he wants, nor is he taking the time until he applies and using it to do things that make him happy. But I don’t think he knows what does make him happy vs what doesn’t and maybe that’s why. It seems as though the issues are out of my control and I just need to step back."
entp,fkpfau0,t1_fkoyt6s,1584408771.0,ISFP-A but I don’t think it is entirely accurate. He is not spontaneous or adventurous at all.
entp,fkpembc,t1_fko8078,1584408276.0,"Haha, I would rather screw God's established hierarchy and have us both be breadwinners."
entp,fkpe1kb,t1_fkoyxyi,1584407896.0,"There is no power imbalance. I wouldn't say he has any more social clout, is better looking (or has any trust fund, haha). He is very patient and stable which attracts me the most to him. He grounds me when I am all over the place. He is a very steady non-excitable person, which in theory is great but is proving to be an issue because I find he lacks passion. I would have no problem if he didn't want to pursue his long term goals for another few years if he were passionate about his current situation or anything really, but he is not. I asked him a few days ago what career/living situation/activity/industry would make him happy and he said he didn't know. He said the only thing that he knows that really makes him happy is soccer, and pursuing a career in coaching that isn't what he wants to do. He is barely making ends meet with bills where he is working now and I know he is capable of earning more because he is very personable and reliable but he doesn't seem to want it himself. Side note: his mom made his resume and applies to jobs for him. I think I do genuinely need to consider our compatibility rather than try and influence his decisions based on what I think is best, because he needs to want it for himself as he knows himself much better than I like to think I do."
entp,fknx3s5,t1_fknwcd3,1584375714.0,"True, I feel like I am being too harsh. The only thing is that he whats to do policing and the application itself can take years (especially if he gets deferred- which is very possible). Does that change your perspective at all? The complacency is unattractive but I also put it in my own perspective and acknowledge that I’m only 21 and still in school, etc."

dpdr,fiu10ps,t1_fisxmex,1582733297.0,Yup I’m the same way. I have a 4.2 gpa but very poor focus.

It’s a vicious cycle lol

I don’t shape it, I literally just cut each curl as it starts to split. I wouldn’t recommend that though I don’t think it’s healthy, my fear just overrides everything haha."
