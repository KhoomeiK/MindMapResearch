I know right where you are and know what you are going through, because I was there, brother. I know how you feel.

There are a couple of things that I would absolutely recommend to you. One, find someone to talk to. Someone who you can trust. A friend, a family member, and - honestly, I can't recommend this enough - a therapist. Someone who can help you process what you're going through.

Second, take time to grieve. To mourn. To process that trauma in your own time, and your own way. 

Take time not only to work on yourself, but care for yourself as well. Once you feel ready, try to learn something new. Reconnect with something from your past that you've put aside (me, I picked up a guitar for the first time in over a decade after everything crashed down around me). Find a new hobby. Something active, something that you have to work at. Use it as a form of meditation, as a focus. Try to improve your diet. Keep hydrated. Get some exercise when and where you can.

Focus on your children. What you're going through right now? This is going to be so much harder on them. Let them know that, whatever the circumstances are, you'll always be there for them even if you aren't physically there. And set yourself to be the best parent you can possibly be. They're going to need you.

This might sound incredibly trite, but I want to stress one more thing to you: IT GETS BETTER. Every day gets easier. Sometimes you stumble, sometimes you can't sleep, sometimes you want to curl up in a ball and die. But keep going, because eventually you're going to make your way back to daylight. 

I wouldn't know you from Adam, but I'm pulling for you and I have your back. You'll be okay. You got this."

New Year's Eve will mark the one-year anniversary of her moving out, and about 18 months since she first told me she wanted a divorce. It devastated me then. Now, I look at it as her setting me free. I've reconnected with myself, and I've met someone someone who actually makes me feel wanted. Worthy. Deserving of love and respect. Something that, looking back now with a clear mind, I can't remember my ex ever doing.
