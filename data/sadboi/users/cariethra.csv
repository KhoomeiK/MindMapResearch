I have a friend who is an order writer for a grocery store. Their work is keeping the shelves stocked despite the over buying. It is a lot of work and takes a lot of logic and problem solving. They have to forecast sales and take into consideration expiration dates. It isn’t all that different than a Stockbroker having to determine when to trade stock."

That makes about 15-20 servings. You can also sub out the turkey for 1/4 lb of lentils and make it vegan."

It works well. The house is clean and everyone get more time doing what they enjoy."

todayilearned,fl2mhjv,t1_fl2f8lq,1584754553.0,Nope been that way since I was a tiny kid. It hurts inside not the skin.
todayilearned,fl2mg8j,t1_fl2hq15,1584754528.0,Always has since I was a small child. Like internal pain. Saying that most doctors don’t give a rats ass about the other pain I have. I doubt they’ll do anything.
