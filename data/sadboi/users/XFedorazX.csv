depression,f6qv1zj,t3_dsh88s,1573086654.0,"I get where your coming from, but personally it makes me feel good to talk to people and give them friendly insight."
SuicideWatch,f6qsrum,t3_dscslu,1573084985.0,Goddamn. Sorry to hear they were such little bitches about it...
depression,f4e94uv,t3_dk9cca,1571554140.0,"Feels yo. When I got out of a mental hospital after getting a bit to close to suicide, none of my fuckin ""friends"" asked me if I was okay. And when I butchered the shit out of my arm, the only friends that cared were ones I wasn't even very close to."
SuicideWatch,f3e8ap1,t1_f3e893l,1570862452.0,Yeah...
SuicideWatch,f3e7zf3,t1_f3e7o6b,1570862011.0,"Hey, thanks for the response. I really appreciate having someone listen. Personally, I'm a very empathetic person. I hate it when people around me are feeling bad. I mean, the only thing my parents can do is get mad I guess, but I don't wanna hurt them..."
SuicideWatch,f3e7ccr,t3_dgpm7z,1570861118.0,I'm sorry. I hope things get better.
SuicideWatch,f3e7aow,t3_dgq94j,1570861054.0,"Yeah. I'm a guinea pig too. been maxed out on 3 different med's over the course of less than a year. Life is some donkey ass tbh. But I'm really sorry, and I hope things get better. It won't happen overnight, but I really hope you find something that helps you. Cya..."

SuicideWatch,f2ulofc,t3_de5a9e,1570419989.0,"I'm sorry have to go through this. Thats how I feel everyday. (However, I have only been suffering for a little less than 4 years.)  It's very odd, talking about blowin' your brains out, and then having someone act like your desired action is unheard of. I'm a huge edgelord so all I really talk about is suicide, and people act like my ideas are crazy. It's quite annoying when people act like suicide is crazy. If you want to talk, I and many other community members are here for you."
SuicideWatch,f2ul45c,t3_de53ht,1570419511.0,"Unfortunately, this isn't uncommon. I first started to think about suicide frequently at age 10. When you talk to her, DO NOT say her thoughts are selfish, unheard of, or similar. That'll make it far worse. (Usually that is.) I'm very sorry that your sister wishes to take her life. I wish I could give anymore advice, but I have no siblings. I sincerely hope she gets better."
SuicideWatch,f2pmhl1,t3_ddyutp,1570346448.0,"Hello there! It's midnight where Ilive and I'm up and just read your story. I was in a very similar situation recently. JuSt TuRnEd 14 So CaN't ReLatE tO bEiNg 13 LoL. All jokes aside, things don't just ""get better."" The only why it does if YOU make it better. It's hard. I've never ""gotten better."" (I kinda avoid it. I'm kinda messed up.) But you can try. You want to be happy. You can make youself happier. I believe in you. I know I'm just a random person on Reddit, but you sound like you are fully equipt to make your life amount to something greater than it already is. I'm glad to hear that you bring happiness to your friends and family. :) You can be happy. I know you can. Have a good evening/morning! :)"
SuicideWatch,f2pkz0g,t3_ddzd9r,1570345479.0,"I'm sorry. But trust me. Your father won't get any better with the loss of your life. That will only make things worse for the man. Parents rarely wish they were without their child, (partially because we are programmed to love our offspring as a species of mammals.) And after doing some research, I couldn't find any link of stress and gastric cancer. His illness isn't your fault. Nor is your mental illness. Unfortunately, we can't change our brain chemistry through any proper method. In summary, killing yourself for his sake will provide the oppisite of what you want. Just stick by his side and support him through his illness. Being possitive around him will probably be the best thing you can do for him. Please don't kill yourself. Best whishes!"
SuicideWatch,f2ph6ir,t3_ddqkho,1570343210.0,"I sorry you feel this way. I hope if you survived the night, you got help and found people who you feel happy around. If you have survived, try to find some friends here on Reddit (and other websites) and in your surroundings. Stay safe everyone. Always weigh the options before taking action."
depression,f2pbu4c,t3_ddyl9z,1570340595.0,I used to want cancer.
depression,f2p381p,t3_ddmumq,1570336973.0,"I think we can all relate. Your not trash like you might think you are. You feel that way, but trust me, anyone who you are even slightly close to cares. They might not let it on, but they care and they don't hate you. I feel everything you said. Nor have you wasted our time. We, on reddit, care.  When I got out of a mental hospital around a year ago, none of my friends asked if I was ok. They just thought, typical \[me\]. But unfortunately, they do seem to care. I think we legit might be the same person, cause I do everything you said in this post about yourself. Normally I would end with the same ""sorry for wasting your time"" thing, but I wanna keep it a little bit more positive for you, and not make it seem like I'm mocking you or something. I don't know you, but I care. And so does a lot of people who have read your post. I hope you can find some people who you feel care for you, although your friends actually do care. Have a nice night/day/afternoon.   :)"
