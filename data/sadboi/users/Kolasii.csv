Brewis Ginley, just want to say thank you so much for all of the amazing content over the past 11 years. From such humble beginnings with WOW tutorials to a huge group of incredible people, you have kept the whole ship together and going forward to new greats. The Yogscast have introduced me to so many of the games that I love today. I guess this whole thing was just to say thanks. The content will always cheer me up and I will still watch this for a long time. It's been an amazing ride so far and here's to another 11 years. 

Cheers,

K"
