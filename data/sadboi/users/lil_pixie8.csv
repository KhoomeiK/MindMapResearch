I know if can be embarrassing, but if you are honest, typically most ER nurses and doctors will be understanding (we 99% of the time already know and hate when the patients lie about it, as if we haven't seen it hundreds of times before lol). The reason it's so important to tell them, is a lot of times the abcess can be caused by part of the needle breaking off in the arm. Do they need to do a x-ray go make sure that's not the case and if it is, they just need to make sure it gets removed. 

Also, most ER's have a list of numbers they can give you of rehab options. I would tell my using patients to fold it up and keep it in their wallet. I would have a heart to heart with them, explaining that they deserve better. I would always end it with keep this paper with you all times, bc one day you will be ready to quit and get help or you'll hit rock bottom and realize you have no where else to go. It may not be today and may take you years, but it will happen. When it happens, I don't want you to be alone... that's when you'll need this paper the most.

Unfortunately, we didn't have any warning and never knew about the scream until it happened. I had bought a rabbit for my daughter and he was only a few months old. I think he had some kind of digestive absorption issue, bc although he would eat plenty, he was always very skinny and I couldn't get him to gain weight (the breeder even tried, but he just didn't seem to gain). On Thanksgiving my daughter came running into my room screaming and crying bc he was drinking water then just suddenly went into a seizure. I was so sick from chemo that day and of course no vets were open, but I rushed her and the rabbit into my car and called the nearest emergency vet to give them a heads up. The nearest one was about an hour away and even though I tried my best to get there, he had another seizure about half way to the hospital and let out this scream, then passed away in my daughter's arms. I thought with the chemo that I couldn't feel any worse, but I was terribly wrong. Between hearing that scream, along with my daughter's breaking heart, I'd take chemo over either of those any day!!! The breeder had warned that he might not make it, but I told her that I wish she would have warned us about the possibility of hearing that; although to be honest, I don't think there's any way to truly prepare someone."
