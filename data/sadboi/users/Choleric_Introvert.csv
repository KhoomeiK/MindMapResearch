Narcolepsy,fpnqdfu,t3_g0mx60,1588770254.0,"So I'm on roughly day 55 of quarantine. I've been taking Sunosi (75mg) for roughly 8 months  and it has actually been very effective - until now.  


I went from working at home by myself, to working at home with my wife (also working at home) and our 6 year old son. This has proven to be stressful and very difficult to say the least. Roughly day 40, I noticed that my EDS symptoms were creeping back - and my anxiety ramping up as well. When this happens I lose the ability to focus and exhibit adhd symptoms as well.  


My general question is - how is everyone else dealing with this? This is clearly very difficult for everyone but I feel like those of us who are suffering from EDS due to narcolepsy, etc are getting hit very hard. Being more stressed and stationary really brings out the worst in our symptoms. I'm going to be upping my Sunosi dosage to 150mg and my doctor is also pressing that I try Xyrem (something I'm not sure I'm ready to do yet).   


It's important to remember that we're all in this together and any tidbits of helpful or positive information will go a long way."

Narcolepsy,fnsujea,t3_g3hh9g,1587229060.0,"I doubt that narcolepsy itself relates to lower IQ/testing scores but the symptoms of narcolepsy that come from quality sleep deprivation absolutely do.
For a portion of time before I was diagnosed, doctors thought I had really bad ADHD and anxiety. Turns out that not sleeping well can cause both of those to happen. I struggled taking tests due to this and fell behind in school.
Once I got the proper diagnosis, was put on a treatment plan, and made some lifestyle changes - I would consider myself a very high-functioning adult now.
Quality sleep deprivation can cause all kinds of nasty psychological symptoms. Until there's a cure or treatment of our chemical imbalance, it's important to use medication that best assists your deficiencies."

ABSOLUTELY you should try pairing therapy with medical treatment. Medication treats the physical symptoms of our affliction, and therapy treats the mental symptoms. At the end of the day, you need to know that what is happening to you is not your fault. Gaining the proper coping mechanisms to realize this is difficult and therapy can help you with that.

I wish there were therapists that dealt specifically with people who have sleep deprivation but I think it's too narrow of a field currently. Either way I would start and just try to find the best one that works with you.

It's not your fault, talking about it can help, and know that there is light at the end of the tunnel."

Nothing, and I mean nothing, would be more satisfying than a comprehensive dismantling of them that nails the door shut on success for years to come. If given the chance, I hope Harbaugh hangs every point he can on them - no mercy.

Sleep depravation causes so many side effects that it's likely impossible to pinpoint which causes which. I've got my EDS symptoms largely under check with medication, though getting up in the morning is still hell. I've recently paired this with therapy. While everyone's travel with therapy will vary I would highly recommended just starting somewhere and see where it takes you.

My anxiety and depression was getting out of hand and I never thought that it could be a symptom of N. Working though my challenges with therapy has been an incredible help and put a unique perspective on my life that I was previously unable to have. 

In short, I would highly recommend seeing a licensed therapist to at least see where it goes. None of your condition is your fault and you need to know that."

Narcolepsy,f4ykwqq,t3_dm5v5u,1571878887.0,"You are not alone, my friend. It was worse when I was younger but I used to frequently experience sleep paralysis, before I was diagnosed with Narcolepsy. Imagine being a young college student researching 'the hag that I see at night and can't move'. I'm getting chills up my spine just writing this, thinking about it. I have sleep paralysis episodes that I remember from years ago.

Extra creepy story: I slept over at a friend's house when I was in high school, two single beds in the same room. We always used to joke the his house was haunted (weird noises in a crawl space, whispers in the bathroom, things being moved), I'm sure all completely explainable logically. The night that I stayed over I had a full-on 'old hag' episode. Woke up the next day and was, per usual, unnerved for hours. Fast-forward 5 years or so later and that same friend and I were having a late night snack at Denny's. We started talking about his parent's old 'haunted house'. I brought up that I was recently diagnosed with narcolepsy and that, jokingly, his house invoked the old hag that one night. As soon as I told him what happened his face went white. He then admitted that the same thing happened to him, the same night. He doesn't have narcolepsy and had not had sleep paralysis before that night. This of course sent us spiraling into a ridiculous conversation about paranormal bullshit. Needless to say, I can still bring it up to this day and both of us get creeped out.

Tldr; you aren't alone, our affliction does powerful things to our brain. Keep yourself grounded, meditation (mindfulness), exercise, and eat right. The little, and simple things, add up."

It's also worth mentioning that the gap between an 8th ranked class and a 3rd is enormous. Classes in the top 3, normally Bama, Clemson, OSU are full of can't-miss players. We usually get one a year as to where the top three classes have multiple."

Wisconsin losing to Illinois is a great example of what can happen when you play the same style of predictable football, IE Michigan. We've entered Lloyd Carr 2.0 levels of predictability.
As far as negativism is concerned, if we can't voice our concerns as fans, season ticket holders, or alumni, nothing will change. Harbaugh has took this program from out of the dark ages into an above-average Big Ten team. I love him as a dude, a mentor, and truly think he's the right guy for the program. If it weren't for OSU we would have had multiple shots at a Big Ten title and potentially more. But that's my point - we are not and will never be OSU at this pace. The sooner we accept that the sooner we can realign realistic expectations with what the program can and will be. 
Facts: We've beat OSU 4 times in 20 years and one of those wins was against a heavily sanctioned team with no coach (Fickell). Harbaugh is 1-9 vs top 10 teams, 0-7 as an underdog, and 1-6 vs ranked opponents on the road. We can't punch up, ever.
If you're willing to accept those stats as acceptable than please, continue to drink the Kool-Aid. 
I still love the kids, the school, and everything that goes with it. But I'm not going to delusion myself into thinking that we have any shot against an elite team like OSU. They have more talent, better coaching, and hate us way more than we hate them (I live in Columbus, it's unbearable)."

The reality is that Harbaugh has consistently underperformed when it has mattered most. Sure, we could be going 7-5 with Hoke or some other chucklehead but we don't have Hoke. We have a coach with an insanely lucrative salary. 
In big games it almost seems as if they don't even study film of the other team. Last year vs OSU and this year vs Wisconsin, it was like we were playing a different sport. This comes down to preparation and coaching, something that I just don't think Jim is very good at anymore. 
Maybe we are putting unfair expectations on the program for what they can be but until we look competitive in a big game vs a ranked opponent or on the road as an underdog I'm not going to hold my breath for success. As the article points out, even Auburn beats Alabama sometimes."

Look at networking as solving someone's problems. Ask the recruiter what he needs and do a ton of listening. This will give you an idea of what his/the company's problem is.
