However, this is a hard subject. If you keep pressing it, she will probably start to resent you. You seem to be a good dad, just continue being there for her regardless of how this situation plays out. That's what she's going to remember, not the difficult choice she has to make either way, but that her father was there supporting her.

Edit, coming from a woman: Reading through the comments and the people calling this girl a ""woman"" disgusts me. SHE IS A **CHILD**. SHE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT SHE'S GETTING HERSELF INTO."
