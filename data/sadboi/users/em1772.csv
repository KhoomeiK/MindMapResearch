AskWomen,fbw1ld9,t3_eeo132,1577139220.0,"I can’t believe that anybody would want to be with me. If anyone shows any sort of interest I completely shut down as all I can think is that it’s just some joke at my expense. 

Also when I have been with people, I’m such an insecure mess that I’ll let them do whatever they want as long as they stay, end up putting up with a lot of shit"

depression,f2f82o7,t3_dd7uld,1570212701.0,"I have the same, my bed acts as my ‘safe place’ in a way. If I’m feeling particularly down or something has caused me to feel anxious the first thing I want to do it get into bed and wrap myself up in my duvet. I think it comes from not having to act fine while in bed, as there’s nobody around to pretend for, and it also makes me feel safe and protected."
