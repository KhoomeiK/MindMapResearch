I can do roughly 600-700km without taking a 30 minute, so I'll go off of those distances and use trucker path to plan my trips according to those distances along my route.

My distraction is driving semis, though that won't work for yours at the moment, maybe try getting them into a hobby that doesn't involve other people, maybe working on cars, cooking, fishing, or just making things... there's plenty of things out there that could distract them. Also try figuring out what their triggers are that make them want to self harm and once you find out what they are you can start to help."
