Whatever it is that has you playing away wondering if it's too late, it almost certainly isn't. 
Collapsing that thought/wave function into reality is hard though.
Sometimes you can only wait. 
Other times you wonder whether action will break it even more.

depression,ez6x9r8,t1_ez4whte,1567716188.0,"I do like the idea of the future as an amorphous oozing blob, blocking the way forward at every turn, smothering and suffocating the mind, mutating every vision of the future into an faceless unknowable dread. 

It grows larger and more overwhelming with every circuitous thought your mind makes  as the panic grows about the lack of answers to the ever growing list of questions, overlapping and intersecting Catch 22 feedback loops, I need to do this but I can't because I need to do that first and I need to be there to do that, but I can't get there from here, feeding the ever growing blob. 

The magic of the open g has kept the blob at bay, the vibrations causing it to melts away.  Along with bunch of weird nick drake tunings, damn that guy was good. And it seems I bought two spider capos from china when I was obsessing with the little things. Those are great. You should get at least two. If only I could spend the time I spent on fiddling with the tuners thinking through a reasonable long term vision. 

And now I think about it I've not played since I bought this van. This ""12 months MOT"" but now I've taken a proper look is riddled with rust van. Hmm. Sometimes you need someone to come and give you a good mental slap, the old tv trope hysterical woman slap. Calm down. Just get on with it. Will it do what you need it to do? Just get on with it. Keep moving and don't look at the blob.

What I do is I don't follow things through thoroughly enough, I make a bad first pass, get bad information and make incorrect conclusions that fit with my fears and prejudices,  imagined pitfalls, traps, caveats leading to doom, gloom and disaster.  And then run away.

When really if you just went on, just appied the same effort to everything that you applied to discovering an obscure tuning to all the tasks and jobs and problems that you face, it'll be fine. And perhaps even rather good.

I'm going to knock number one off my list. Accomodation.

It gets pretty interesting when you are living in a car or even travelling across a country by bicycle. 

Every time I've been camped up bike touring somewhere weird and someones approached me it's always been with offers of help and assistance!

However it's strange to realise that pretty much everywhere is ""owned"" by someone and you are not generally welcome!

Remember to take a water filter with you. I got the fever shits from eating I think, unwashed fruit. Was delirious for three days. I don't recommened it. Due to the sanitation. A monkey came into my shack and a bottle I'd been pissing in. Stupid moneky. 

The second time i got the squirts was probably ""bottled"" water. I saw the bloke from the shop i bought it from filling the bottles and gluing the lids shut.
Wish I'd have taken a filter, like a LifeStraw or Sawyer Mini.

My favourite place was Parvati Valley in Himachel Pradesh.
I might go back this winter! Snow, mountains, cheap charas.
