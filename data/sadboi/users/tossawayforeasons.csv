The first 20 years of my life were just about a total loss, just a haze of strange memories and isolation.

I was also tempted by the military because I craved structure so badly. People around me didn't want me to go, and that was probably for the best. I remember watching the second Gulf War break out and suddenly people I knew were coming back in bags and segments of the USA seemed to be cheering on the destruction of lives and homes of people who never did anything to us and it made me sick to my stomach.

I've also struggled with addiction and escapism.

About the only thing that's given me any real chance of recovery and starting a new life with a shred of hope has been totally starting over. Sold or lost everything, moved to a different state, found totally different work, established new habits and patterns.

Maybe instead of thinking ""career"" you should think about just starting something new, anything. Think ""job"" first, maybe you'll make a career of something you can throw yourself into and dedicate to. Maybe it just will take putting one foot in front of the other for a while to break the cycle of escapism and anxiety and apathy.

You can't wait for inspiration or motivation to come along and change you. It won't happen, and even if it does, it's not enough to just feel energized about something. Something needs to be your leverage to actually commit to a new direction and start practicing discipline, a little bit at a time, every day.

Don't look for something ideal, don't wait around for the perfect opportunity. Just make some dumb, easy to accomplish goals and do them every day or whatever you need to do to accomplish those goals, and build on them.

Trust your gut on this. I can't peer into your life, but generally for most people, when they start to worry about a habit they have it means their instincts are screaming at them about potential danger.

Now the next thing, your anxiety and panic attacks are directly being effected by your drinking and probably pot use too.

Pot is hit-or-miss when it comes to controlling anxiety, but it generally can make you a lot more susceptible to the anxiety brought on by alcohol withdrawals.

And I'm talking about the equilibrium of your brain. If you're used to drinking daily, your brain is used to flooding you with counter-reactive chemicals to reduce that flood of pleasure chemicals from the alcohol. The brain always regulates itself this way.

The problem is, you stop drinking but your brain still has all that downer-chemical floating around in there, so now without the pleasure boost you crash really hard and feel intense anxiety and panic. It can take weeks to clear that shit out of your head. Even months. If you smoke during this time you're likely to have very heightened paranoia.

If you lay off drinking longer than a few days and really give yourself time to reach a normal equilibrium it will make pot feel a lot more effective for relaxing you, and you have the added benefit of reducing your chances of losing everything you care about and your own life due to alcoholism!"

Up until last year, my life was constantly the left column, every single day. The pain was unbearable and my brain did everything to try to convince me to end it in any way I could, from suicide to crippling alcoholism to just hiding under a blanket in bed for days on end.

Imagine the pain of a kidney stone, but emotionally. Torture tends to make you consider things you never thought you were capable of, it breaks you as a person. That's why torture is supposedly banned. You don't usually recover 100% when part of your psyche is wounded and it takes a long time to get it under control again.

You will say “okay I have to quit” after something bad happens, after you embarrass yourself and people start avoiding you. You will say “but not until the end of the week because *reasons*”

And with this plan firmly in mind, you will feel happy that you’re finally going to get your shit together, but will continue on unchanging until the week end approaches, and then something will come up, something you need a “boost” to get through and you will say “okay, *next* week I quit, I don’t have time to be stressed or anxious this week.” And you will feel good again. You’ll drink all week without guilt because you’re going to quit, right? Then the next week rolls around. “Wait, I can’t quit cold turkey, let me taper off... after the weekend.” And so on. And on.

This is the life of the alcoholic, constantly thinking about and worrying about and obsessing over your own drinking, while continuing to drink.

Get over to /r/stopdrinking and get some support from friends and family, see a doctor about withdrawing safely and make changes to your life to reduce stress.

Or you will lose your life, either literally or figuratively."

CPTSD,fiu5qou,t3_f9qy5i,1582735602.0,"I tried to drink it away.

Let me get in line to tell you it doesn't work.

Not only does it not work, drinking makes you 100x more anxious and depressed as soon as the effects wear off, so in order to keep feeling good you have to keep drinking. All the while making that come-down so much worse.

Let me explain it in really, really layman terms. When you drink, your brain *FLOODS* with ""happy chemicals."" That's why you feel great.

But your brain is a very delicate and sensitive organ, if it detects something is imbalanced, it will try to correct it with a counter-acting chemical. In this case, your brain will control your surge of happiness with ""downer chemicals"" to achieve equilibrium. 

The problem is, these chemicals take a long time to clear out. So even after the alcohol and hangover has passed, your brain is still going to be swimming in downer-juice, and you will ABSOLUTELY FUCKING AWFUL. You will be depressed and anxious unless you drink again or give it enough time for your brain to reach equilibrium again. Weeks, even months. For some, years.

The more you drink, the worse and longer this effect becomes.

Do the opposite. Go out and go for a long run, wind yourself to painful exhaustion. Your brain will counter this with a rush of happy chems. The longer and harder you exercise, the greater and longer this rush will last before your brain reaches equilibrium again.

I lost my mother, my father and my older brother to alcohol. Nearly lost myself too."

My results from therapy and medication varied.

Instead of focusing on the ways you don't like vaginas, focus on the things you do like about them, encourage that kind of association, such as showering together, having sex after shower/bath/pool and compliment on your partner on her cleanliness, etc. Focus more on the parts that turn you on more, such as breasts and buttocks or hair or even face and eyes... there's so much more to sex than just dicks and vaginas.

Vaginas almost always have a musk, just like penises, even after washing. But if there's a foul odor all the time, that may a sign of a health problem, or possibly poor hygiene in general.

It's really, really important to talk to your partner about sex. What you like, what's enjoyable or not, what your preferences are. 

And at the end of the day, if it's all still gross to you, even a little bit, you may want to consider a few difficult possibilities. You may just be one of those people that doesn't enjoy sex so much or are somewhere on the asexual spectrum, in which case you NEED to talk to your partner about it so they don't end up over on /r/deadbedrooms feeling like horrible, unattractive monsters wondering what they are doing wrong and why they're not being touched and physically adored the way they want.

Eventually you get to a point where you have to accept the state of things and everything is okay for a while. Which makes that one, rare moment when someone says something like this completely fuck your head for the rest of your life. 

This guy will *never* stop thinking about this, because it never happened before, will never happen again, and he'll never understand *how* it happened, or what he did to make it happen, and it flies in the face of all he did to come to terms with the fact that women don't flirt with men.

A lot of people who are stuck in a rut or unfulfilling lifestyle might idealize the fantasy about making huge changes and starting over, becoming someone new, only to find that after making huge changes they are still the same person inside with the same issues, but now may be without a support system or may have burned bridges prematurely with their old life and may end up creating a much bigger mess for themselves, minus healthy mind and body to rise to such challenges.

I think it worked well for me because I was doing the opposite, I was jumping from an environment with no support or security to a much more disciplined life around more people who care and can offer support."

It's a hard option, my therapist recommended against it. But I tried everything else, and now it's been half a year and I don't crave alcohol. I vape weed because it's legal here, but that's mostly to help me sleep and relax, not escape my life and get wasted.

Also, alcohol straight up killed most of my family, so there's that."
alcoholism,fefglm9,t3_eokvlx,1579055890.0,"I'm sorry for your loss.

My mother died from liver failure from alcohol a few years ago.

A year after that my brother died from pancreatic failure from alcohol.

A year after that my father died from alcohol poisoning.

my remaining siblings chose to either drink themselves stupid or take off to the far corners of the Earth.

I damn near killed myself the same way to cope with it. Better now. But still haunted by ghosts and regret."
