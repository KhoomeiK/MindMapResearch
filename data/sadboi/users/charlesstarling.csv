depression,epeu0zs,t3_bue9q3,1559187050.0,"I know it’s really hard for you right now, but everything will be ok. I’m not you, so what I am about to say may or may not be right. But I believe that your mom really love you. She wants you to have a wonderful life. And you being sad is just proof that you have great love towards her as well. It’s a powerful bond. She may not be here, but she is looking over you. Cherish and remember all the memories you and your mom had. It’s something precious that can’t be replaced. 

Sadness and depress does not mean that you’re weak, it only mean that you have a strong connection and bond. It’s a trait that’s mistaken for weakness. It will be while, but I just want to let you know that everything will be ok. Almost everyone in the subreddit has similar issue. And we’re willing to hope as best as we can."

depression,ep9vvhr,t3_bu8xc3,1559117169.0,"I know, that's one of the worst feelings ever. It feels that you are almost at a point where you can finally feel whole. But after understanding that you're not special and you're simply like the rest, it hurt. A feeling like all the time spent and you have not made an impact or even is noticed by the person. It is painful and depressing. But it does not mean that it's the end. Though there's not positive, there's also no negative. You have not done anything that made the person hate or distance themselves from you. That alone signify that there's still hope and a chance that something special can happen in the future.

I know your pain, but don't give up mate. Perseverance is your greatest weapon."
