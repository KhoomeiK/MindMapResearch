Anxiety,f93znux,t1_f74b34u,1575072983.0,"Wow, this is the best practical advice I’ve heard. I’ve dealt with anxiety attacks for 8-9 years and the physical symptoms are usually the same that you described. A new one for me is a lump in my throat sensation, but eating and drinking make it feel normal. Your advice helped me mentally side step a threatening panic attack. And I got to enjoy a piece of chocolate pie! Double thanks to you!"
