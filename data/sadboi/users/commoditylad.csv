tattoo,fj28e49,t3_ej7f9o,1582937131.0,"Is it realistic to balance being a full-time student (non-artistic major) and an apprentice at the same time? I get that it depends on the flexibility of your mentor, but I also understand that there's the ""if you want to be a tattoo artist so much, you wouldn't need to go to college"" argument. Because tattooing is a lifestyle and trade you've got to put your all into. I absolutely do respect it as such and believe that it's safe to say that I take it dead seriously. But I just so happen to be earning my bachelor's, too, for a few reasons beyond my own control.

(And, yes, I could just wait till graduation to apprentice, if I really must, sure. But do I *want* to wait any longer? It's like an itch I can't scratch. I just want to do it.)

So I guess that my question is actually whether or not I actually need to justify myself to my future-mentor, even if my portfolio and productivity are straight. 

Like... is being both a college student and requesting an apprenticeship just setting myself up to be brushed off? I know that one day I'm going to have to pick one hat to wear at a time, but this is where my passion lies. *I do not want to pass up the opportunity to earn this hat.* And there's no telling what the future will hold, how unhappy and too-busy-to-apprentice I'll be post-graduation, so I don't see why now would be a bad time.

For me, it feels like school is the side-gig (that I take somewhat seriously) and tattooing is the big, main thing I'm chasing. The bachelor's is a 'backup plan' that appeases my parents, I'll say for a lack of better words. Is that a 'bad' way to 'justify' doing both? *Do I even need to feel insecure about this at all?*

I ask because I've been asking my tattoo artist about his apprenticeship, and he seems to believe that artists can only have one main craft. Because I introduced myself as a musician, he refers to music as my craft, and doesn't really seem to think I feel as passionate about visual art as I actually do. I get 'musician-ed' a lot when I try to talk to him about visual art, hehe.

Others opinions don't matter, I know my own truth, et cetera, but I'm so afraid. I hate that I have, like, fifty hobbies and am 18 and in the process of figuring myself out (which is all fine), but is there ever a time to stop persisting? I don't want to give up on this, but I don't want to be out of line, arrogant, or disrespectful to a tattoo master. That is, disrespectful by waltzing in with a clean portfolio, a polished CV, a nice business card, *and* a pre-existing long-term commitment.

So; other than having all my sh*t together, being punctual, and honest with myself and my future-mentor. Is there a way that I can prove to that I want this and take it seriously? Is already being a full-time student (or full-time anything) a common make-or-break for tattoo artists, when weeding out apprentices? Or am I just overthinking this all."

Rings for hands! And cute bracelets! Lots of them! Any kind of metal band or beaded bracelet is rather masculinizing imo. Makes me feel burlier. And tbh, wearing multiple bands at once is more of a guy thing from what I've seen. Plus, all those rings really accent your hand's definition. And HD hands are associated with men, more often than not. 

Plus, jewelry just looks sophisticated. Not babyish at all. It's meant to enhance what is already there. 

So play around with what you do and don't like.

Socks for feet; the cute ones from the men's section. And cute shoes. Cute ankle macrame jewelry when your ankles are out.  I like simple strips of faux leather; they're sophisticated and fashionable.

As feminine as this all sounds; to me, nothing makes me feel burlier than knowing that I look good enough to eat. So that's my advice.

Flattering accessories provide a sense of control, and have the potential to provide a sense of comfort toward what we dislike. You gotta feel around. Like how I didn't like my hair until I found a haircut and style I actually like. Or I didn't like clothes or fashion until I found the men's section (lol). 

I hated my baby hands and feet until I figured out how to make them not look... babyish? I still experience hand and foot size dysphoria (badly) but I know rings and cute socks takes my attention away from it, because I look more adultish I guess? I don't know if this is healthy but my psychiatrist says that it's a great way to cope with something as slippery as dysphoria.

Like. Y'know what I mean? I'm not saying impulse shopping and wearing 50 rings at the same time is the solution. I'm just saying that maybe this could be another aspect of your personal aesthetic to discover? 

Plus: maybe this is just my personal sense of style; it's just a thought. Do what you need for yourself. 

I know exactly what you're feeling. Best of wishes, man."
BipolarReddit,f3isoat,t1_f3ihpsh,1570941683.0,"Thank you so much for taking time to share you advice. 

I do have a therapist. We talked about how to communicate my disatisfaction today (I've tried and failed to word it plenty of times in the past); lo and behold, my boyfriend beat me to it and we 'broke up.' This week's homework was to find a way to word how I feel without beating around the bush. Guess it's still homework. Haha.

My therapist kind of. Redirects the conversation? Finds no purpose in talking about past traumas, since they've been resolved (can't hurt me anymore, and my flashbacks have decreased in frequency) it's just dwelling to him. I don't know how I feel about this, but I find that telling my family members about the trauma has helped me. Except for my best friend, I didn't tell anyone for eight months: the second person I told was my (ex) bf. And after two years, I finally told other people close to me. 

Ex-boyfriend said that he's willing to talk things through and I'm so grateful. I hope this time around goes differently, and that we can both leave the past in the past this time. 

I'll be sure to make an extra effort to not use sex and drugs to cope with all my problems, this time, too. Lucky for me, this time, I don't have many unusual problems to cope with. The urge isn't as strong. I can't tell if this is the ordinary college student promiscuity or if it's my pre-manic promiscuity. Either way, I'm going to be safe about it.  If I even act on it at all. You're right about the importance of awareness; it kind of gives us control over our impulses.  

Thank you again for your advice, honesty and patience. I hope things are well in your corner of the world and that you have a good night/day/afternoon."

But I'm choosing to transition, because if money, careers and relationships were no object, I would transition without second thought. If I could transition and none of the above were at risk, I'd have *been* on T. It's being disowned and attacked for ""selfish"" reasons that scares me the most. That, and liver complications. But not so much the latter. Hehe. 

And I've tried and tried and tried to tried to deny that I'm trans for years, dress overly girly, ""ignore"" my dysphoria, but that obviously failed. I went back to desperately trying to pass as a dude, every single time. For the sake of my mental health. I just can't fucking *lie to myself* like that, man.

Like even if my personality was the exact same, I still wouldn't want to be cis, because I just can't *imagine* myself being cis. I would most likely look and act the exact same, just call myself a girl. Which feels like a lie to me in this lifetime. I came out because I'm tired of lying. It hurts me. Like I have five million hobbies for a reason lol.

And I can't imagine looking and acting the same without trying to pass. So it's just really hard to imagine myself living as a woman without being dissatisfied with literally everything, because I'm ignoring a piece of myself that I can't ignore. 

But if I *could* happily live cis, it'd literally be me, but from a genderbent!AU fanfiction lmao

unpopularopinion,f2ts2az,t1_f2th9ef,1570399592.0,"I never said that it wasn't. But police brutality effecting literally everyone doesn't stop racial profiling from existing, hun. 

Plus there's literally more White people than Black people (77% compared to 13% of USA's population) so those numbers makes sense. 

That and poverty is a cycle. The higher the poverty in an area, the higher the crime rate is likely to be. And socioeconomic status is what segregates. You're right about Black on Black crime but like. Bro.

People of color are more likely to be discriminated against by authorities; be that through violence, or judgement, which are broad terms. 

Pointing out systemic racism doesn't deny that class-- and sometimes luck-- doesn't factor into how authorities treat someone. You can't use 'it isn't just POC who face these problems in the US' to belittle systemic racism. 

Because systemic racism doesn't stop biases from crossing social intersections, from being just as awful. Nor is it pissing and moaning. So stop belittling what is literally there. You aren't being threatened or accused of anything, here. I made this post to unite two worlds. Not to make a contest of 'what ethnicity has it worse in USA?' because oppression shouldn't ever be a contest. Gross. 

However, all that ""racism is overblown/not only _____ has it hard out here/you're overreacting to a coincidence"" talk implies that oppession is a contest. It's erasure, because it belittles someone's experience. 

I hate to make assumptions but I could guess that you don't live in Chicago. Lol. Things are *tense* here (as it can be, literally everywhere else), and this shit is real. No less real than not-racially-charged injustice. If you've never experienced discrimination because of your skin, religion, or identity, just believe whoever has. 

America isn't perfect for anyone. Just accept that this country was literally built upon racism and genocide, for centuries, before it was steered toward equality. *Which is why we're not all treated as equally as we should be, yet.*"
unpopularopinion,f2pozig,t3_ddxz3i,1570347865.0,"No. It isn't overblown, people just focus on the wrong things imho. I feel like that's what you mean. But ""racism exists but way overblown"" hurts my heart, because I see that it isn't what you meant, so you worded it the way you did. That's alright, you probably aren't looking at racism at a bigger scale.

Hehe this is long asl, man. Apologize but I'm passionate about these things. TLDR starts at the fifth-to-last chunk/paragraph.

The government and Justice system sets us up to fail, but people are choosing to pay more attention to microaggressions, than to police brutality, hate crime, and wrongful convictions. 

I say ""us"" because I'm Black.

I'm assuming you're aren't a POC and probably see people who are POC talk about racism, but this goes over your head because you haven't been harassed by a cop. 

Or accused of stealing when, you didn't steal, you're literally *just* black in a store with someone racist nearby. So you have to empty your pockets and be sure not to get emotional or act too paranoid, because you don't know if security is going to be reasonable or if security will try to taze you or something.

I'm Black and live in a suburb. I used to live in a dangerous neighborhood in Chicago, a heavily segregated city. 

The government put heroin in *our* neigborhoods and killed and incarcerated us for having it. For using it. But *now,* decades later, it's finally considered an epidemic, because majority of opioid abuse is done by Caucasians. And it *is* an opioid crisis. It never wasn't. 

Don't tell me racism isn't overblown. Don't fucking tell anyone that bullshit. Don't teach it to your kids, it just makes racism even worse.

Unless you believe I don't have a right to be upset about children being shot by police, because they have dark skin and are holding a phone? 

That happened. A little boy was holding a cellphone, a cop saw him hold it up and shot him. He thought a child was holding a gun. Not because a rectangle looks like a gun, but because the child was Black, therefore dangerous, so the cop is on edge about what he should do about a 'suspicious young adult'. Look up how often it happens. 

Look up how often our kids go missing and we only hear about it once. But little AJ whose parents killed him? We heard about him for weeks. As we *should* hear about police looking for missing children. But not little black and brown babies, unless they're studying abroad. 

Do you have any idea what's going on at the border between Mexico and USA? 

Don't tell me ""it's an immigration ban"" its a Muslim ban. If it were an immigration ban, we'd be doing the same thing at Canada's border. To all immigrants from overseas. We aren't completely respected by the government and you *can't fucking tell me that I'm not.* I'm not citing anything because these are current (or historical) events and if you have access to Reddit, you can look it all up. I encourage you to. I shouldn't have to prove to you the heartbreak I experience. 

I *could* find you articles about the opioid scenario in the later 1900s and about AJ and about that ""immigration ban"" but if you don't believe me you're free to do as you wish. 

And if you find *one* fact that says something like ""opioids were used by muhmuhmuh it was a choice"" dude they wouldn't have BEEN there in the first place if authorities didn't put em there. And have you ever tried drugs? Its a form of escapism. Poverty is associated with crime. If I had weed growing up, I'd have gotten high everyday just to calm my nerves about the gunshots outside, and about the other facts of life. People make mistakes. 

*But that entire opioid thing is just one example of underprivileged communities being set up to fail.* 

It's literally the same as the tobacco industry profitting off nicotine addiction. But you aren't saying that nicotine addicts are overblowing targeted advertisment, right? Bc that'd be messed up, right?

The poor are segregated from the rich; that's just how income relates to housing. And because poverty is a cycle, lots of families have been poor for generations and generations until to day. Dating, all the way back to sharecropping and debt, which dates all the way back to slavery. Which, in this country, majority of Black people were slaves, not even two hundred years ago. 

So you stay in the same place, with the same financial situation, for years, unless you just don't. But not everyone poor, regardless of ethnicity, in the world manages to lift their families from poverty. That's just how it is.

As for job opportunities. Two hundred years ago, employers were white men (because literally everyone else was either oppressed until a certain point). If they were racist, they didn't hire black people. Sexist? No women. Because they're not competent because if their inferior genes. 

It slowly got better and better and better, and *now* we can do something about discrimination in the work place. And now people are accepting. People have been becoming more accepting for decades, but I'm not trying to act like I was alive in the 80's.

That doesn't stop poverty from being a cycle. If you poor you're likely uneducated. And if you're uneducated you might not make a lot of money. Which means you probably live in an underfunded neighborhood. Which means you probably live where there aren't a lot of resources (but that's slowly improving, too!), might even live in a food desert. 

TLDR: If you don't know what a food desert is then you have a lot of research to do and should *not ever say anything about any minority group overblowing their oppression. You're in no place to say so because you aren't experiencing it so who the hell are you to say.* And I promise I'm not trying to be mean, and I'm not angry with anyone on this post, I'm just saying. It's unfair, it hurts my heart, and is further proof as to why the phrase ""racism is overblown"" simply has room for revision. 

I'm not sorry if you feel like I'm shitting on your feelings, because if you never ever thought about any of these things (AKA you're either White or EXTREMELY fortunate), then your feelings are valid but irrelevant. You aren't on the receiving end of the racism-stick. 

Cops are killing *our* children and men, attacking *our* women, teachers are failing *our* kids because they blame the child for their failure. *We* are ten times more likely to be discriminated against by a judge. To be killed and brought no justice. To be incarcerated. To fail standardized tests, because the questions on them are created by people who rep well funded schools. Not underfunded. And majority of students in underfunded schools, are of color. Look it up and prove me wrong if you don't believe me.

Don't call me racist for using and emphasizing ""our."" Not using it would take away from the fact that all that bullshit goes on because of subconscious and conscious racism. 

If you aren't white then look at the numbers, honey. We came a long way but have a long way to go. Btw I'm Black and live in a suburb and have nothing against anyone here. There's no need to get defensive, I'm not calling anyone racist. Just saying that you probably mean to word the phrase differently."

In other words, if you’re white and haven’t been exposed to other cultures and financial situations, you prolly don’t see that connection. If you’re Black it might hit home for you.

Racism is Social Darwinism; it’s believing in the concept of ‘race,’ a correlation between genetics, intelligence and behavior. Therefore, there are superior and inferior races. Saying what is *deadass* your reality isn’t racist. So don’t be that dude who says that it is.

We just use ‘race’ interchangeably with ‘ethnicity’ so we don’t look use ‘race’ with a superior-and-inferior sort of way, we just use it.

Anyway. To me:

- “you so motherfuckin’ dangerous” alludes to wrongful convict and racial profiling. Bc Black men are especially ‘dangerous’ to the majority of the US’s population (AKA white people). That’s why the 13.something% of us is more likely to die, more likely to get the death sentence, more likely to be sent to jail even if we’re innocent. And that’s just Black people. This type of discrimination applies to other minority groups as well.
- “all these other n***** lame as fuck we show em no resepct” implies that those who lack material possession (AKA the poor AKA LOTS of minorities) aren’t done justice. Nuff said.
- “take your hoodie off” is a part M A N Y “the police can and will kill you at any time” conversations, I promise you.
- “diabetes to the first degree” is ‘murder to the first degree’ because diabetes can be deadly and ‘first degree’ is part of a sentence
- “No, don’t shoot me down” reminds me of ‘Don’t shoot. I want to grow up,’ which was a writing program in 2012. Chicagoan teens affected by gun violence wrote their stories of trauma and paranoia and stitched them together to share with our governor. I don’t know much more about it, other than there were billboards of it all over my neighborhood. The violent one, I mean. It didn’t slow down police brutality and gang violence, because it’s such an unsung thing. Which is why it’s important for songs like this to exist, and for interpretations like mine to be shared. This perspective doesn’t get the attention it needs, except for in echo chambers of conversations, which makes it even harder to solve problems like these.
- “I want you by my side/keep me safe” conceal and carry.
“You could be dangerous to me or to anyone else” might be referring to conceal and carry, gun death by suicide, and racial profiling.
- And when I say “gun” is emphasized, not only does Tyler describe “you” as a gun without calling him a gun, but “a boy is a gun*” gets extra bass. Not to mention, the vocals build a major 7-flat-5 chord, instead of a major 7, like the sample. Let’s not ignore that deep, heavy bass that lets you know that something dark lies beneath the surface. Plus, that flat 5th is anxiety inducing. And if you aren’t into music theory, you can Google it. 

And of course this all has to do with romantic heartbreak, as well, like all of the above has said, it’s Tyler, the Creator. Everything is a double entendre, you just have to catch it. 

I’m tired but really want to put my interpretation of this song out there. I haven’t found one like it and think that representation is important, so I’m commenting on here. I’m in the process of writing a full analysis (for an English class) so I’ll explain in depth-in depth there.

menstrualcups,ewz8jqo,t3_cq61xb,1565892570.0,"I have the same experience since using the Diva Cup!

I Googled it a while back and this isn't uncommon. I *believe* I read that majority of menstrual cups create a light suction, and so do others. 

I think some article a gyne wrote said that it isn't impossible for the period to quite literally be sucked out of you, thus shortening your bleeding time. Period symptom(s) intensity and duration depend on the person; some people feel better, some feel worse, some feel no different."
BipolarReddit,ewtygc8,t3_cpym65,1565757654.0,"I've only smoked or eaten an edible during either during my hypomanic or stable times. Never while I was depressed, or even generally discontent. Not on purpose. I just don't smoke much. 

While hypomanic, I just think I'm God. I can do anything. 

An example was my first edible, Junior year. Taffy. Split it with a pal. 

I wrote a 6-paged researcg paper for an AP class that explained why over population doesn't actually exist (and that relocation would be an easy fix if it weren't for financial and social hurdles). In forty five minutes. I scored a 100%. 

Got a perfect score on a test I knew nothing about, the same day. I made my BS make genuine sense for the first time in months. It was just chicken scratch-y. 

Friends told me I got on a table and rapped about immigration rights non stop during a history presentation. I believed I was an all powerful taco. (Yes, a taco.) That everything I saw that happened, happened because I *let* it happen. That I, the meat, was surrounded by the world, my shell. And everyone around me will be ground corn, soon. Metaphorically. 

I felt like I controlled everything. So I did whatever came to mind, the second it came to mind. Drew a lot. Ran into a wall. Drummed on lockers. My powers justified why I could do whatever I wanted. Why I was so powerful and merciful to not kill everyone around me with a snap of my finger. Which I remember to be the reason behind my giggles. Grandiosity. 

This was all one day.

My then-friend who was my height, my weight, and an athlete, are the other half of the same edible. He didn't do none of this shit lol. He laughed at everything and ate a lot. Felt good and relaxed. 

When my overall mood is stable, I pretty much act drunk, I think? After typing it out, I think it resembles drunkedness.

While stable, my senses are just heightened and I'm less alert. In a moving car, I feel like a vessel full of water. Everything tastes and feels HD all of a sudden. My limbs feel weighted. I can't comprehend speech or movement until the effects begin to wear off. I get super mellow and super horny. Restless. And nobody could ever know any of that unless I said. Being high becomes a secret I can't hide for the life of me, which is what I find so funny, then. 

I was high with my boyfriend and two of his friends. I wouldn't stop talking or laughing, when his friend's dad called. I laughed harder when my boyfriend gently shushed me, so he pressed two fingers to my lips and then to his own, smiling. God, I love him. For whatever reason, I thought ""what if I sucked on his fingers?"" and then immediately sucked on his fingers. He shivered, looked at me, and then just held my hand. He kissed my cheek, said to wait until the friend got off the phone before I finish my story, and I was quiet and even happier and smiling. I don't know if everyone experiences weed-impulses like this but yeah. Out of body-ish. 

This all sounds funny and stupid as hell but yeah, man. I personally love weed. Calms me down overall. Makes me let go. But I can let go *too* much, rather quickly. I'm afraid of thinking something dangerous, and then immediately doing that dangerous thing. So I try to put myself around someone I care for, who cares for me. 

I know I *already* think in a nutso-boing-boing kind of way. Gettjng high blurs the lines between my beliefs and my intrusive thoughts, which turns my every thought into an impulse. That is *not* good for *many* reasons. 

So I do my best to indulge in modesty, and exclusively in safe spaces."

detrans,ew6f6oc,t1_ew6dk5s,1565166447.0,"Thank you for your input. That's a thought I've been chewing on for a while. 

Gender expectations never *actually* effected my way of living. Aside from the uniform thing, I mean, but not because ""only girls wear skirts."" Skirts are cute. I just can't stand how they bring out my leg's curves and make my shoulders look narrower. Once I gain enough muscle to be mentally comfortable with wearing them, I'll wear 'em more. 

But yeah. Unless I had to, if I didn't/don't want to do something, I wouldn't/won't do it. If I do/did, then I will/would. Unless I legit can't. 

I expected I'd end up having an Adam's Apple, deep voice, and an angular structure ""at the end"" of puberty, as I thought existed. But it doesn't work that way so no change happened. 

Gender roles didn't make me feel uncomfortable, because I was always comfortable with my interests and personalities as a girl. I didn't feel distraught or conflicted, personally. I didn't even think about what it's like to be a woman vs. what it's like as a man then, and still don't. Both have pros and cons, in my experience. I can relate to all kinds of things-- we're all just people-- but still don't see myself as either. 

And I was sexually abused for months, while living as a trans man. I likely would have been raped on my high school campus, then, if timing was slightly different. I learned that people are just assholes with no specific target, sometimes. But I'm 18 and don't know everything; haven't seen everything. That was just one bad experience.

I experience dysphoria and resonate with ""non binary"" more than I do ""woman"" or ""man,"" God knows why. It feels like I'm being honest with myself and others for once, instead of like I'm hiding. Which is what living as a woman, or as a trans man, both felt like to me.  

I'm going to continue to rule out any other unaddressed issues or possibilities with my therapist. I appreciate your honesty. Thank you for reading all of what you read, by the way, that's extremely selfless of you. 

(God I talk to much!! lol so) Thank you for your time and patience. I'm sorry if this was a selfish post and/or comment. But I digress. I honestly believe we need to have more of these kinds of discussions."

unpopularopinion,ew2e7oa,t3_b6otj1,1565044511.0,"As a non binary person (I'm being serious) I partially agree. I have a 2-part TLDR at the end bc I talk too much, and I have a lot to say about this topic. Lmao. 

This is such an appropriated identity; too many tomboys confuse clothing preferences for identity, and then try to get attention for it. It's unfair for *us* as trans people, because so many people don't take us seriously. Again. After decades and decades of fighting for positive representation and inclusion. For our rights. And now a bunch of people go and mess it all up. Not because they're young and cringey, but because too many people turn being trans into a bandwagon. *God,* I can't stand it, either.

Don't get me wrong. Doing stuff to discover yourself, and doing stuff for attention, are two different things. Both happens in many aspects of identity. Gender identity is just a popular subject these days, which is why so many kids and people are making it bandwagon to hop on. Or, ""transtrending."" It's upsetting and toxic for multiple communities.

Trans people experience gender dysphoria with their secondary sex characteristics, and how they're perceived. It is distressful, uncomfortable-- I could talk all day about mine. You look in the mirror and can't recognize yourself; it's not about being fat or skinny. Your body was just structured entirely differently than you imagine, and you constantly have to deal with it. Hence the need to transition. The need to change your biology, pronouns and adjectives. 

Because clothing isn't definitive. Cis and trans men wear feminine things and are still men. Cis and trans women can wear masculine things and still be women. And there's always androgynous apparel. Everyone is still themselves regardless of their clothes (and hobbies.)

Clothing and societal roles are social constructs. Sex is biological. Gender identity combines biology with socialization. 

(Which is why all these little kids need to stop claiming to be transgender *solely* because they like androgynous shit. It gives us a bad reputation and embarrasses them in the long run. Even worse, if they *do* medically transition and don't need to, they're stuck with dysphoria for the rest of their lives.)

Non binary people (speaking from my experience) experience dysphoria from both directions. It makes you feel dysphoric to be perceived as a man, and dysphoric to be perceived as a man. A wardrobe change isn't enough; because there's still the social and biological dysphoria that clothing can't change. Hence the preference for androgynous pronouns and adjectives. Clothing, again, is not definitive. So clothing preferences varies from person to person.

Imagine feeling like a freak your whole life. Because you've dealt with dysphoria for years before you even knew what ""dysphoria"" means. But you don't identify with your sex-assigned gender, but you don't identify with the opposite gender, either. Until you finally find a word that doesn't make you have to pick either one of the two. Doesn't make your skin crawl. ""Non binary."" ""Neither identifying as a man nor a woman."" They/them. It doesn't make you cringe, it doesn't make you feel like you're lying, and it's possible. 

Now this part is even more personal. Aside from wanting a penis, my dysphoria is the exact same as majority of trans man's. And even there, not all trans men want penises. But all trans men see themselves as men, are comfortable with being refered to with he/him pronouns, and with being called burly things. Me? That makes my skin crawl just as much being called she/her or a woman does. And having the word ""non-binary"" to define myself is what makes me feel empowered about that discomfort, instead of like an awkward subcategory of ""I'm not cis? But I'm not trans? But that's ridiculous because I can't just be neither?"" Like. I feel at peace with myself, now. I don't feel like I ""have"" to be a man or a woman if I genuinely am uncomfortable with calling myself either.

I do doubt myself. Maybe I'm a trans man, but am simply not used to being called a man. I don't know. It's a process so I'm not too worried about doing anything, but figuring out how to alleviate my dysphoria at the moment. (And the rest of my life. And how to transition from college to real-adulthood once I cross that bridge. Lol)

I've lived as both a girl/young lady, *and* a transman for years. Why I identify as non binary is because it simply suits me better than the former two, and doesn't make me feel dysphoric. Just feels right. And I don't go abd turn it into my personality (like many ""transtrenders"" seem to) because I don't want attention for it. It and my transition are quite personal. I'll share my experiences in discussions like these, but not out of hypocrisy. The only thing I tell people is what my pronouns are; because I was diagnosed with a mood disorder, and don't want to have a bad day and then mentally break down over a stupid easy fix like pronouns. That, and people just can't read minds. 

However, I have trouble telling people my pronouns because I've had several bad experiences with doing so. People laugh in my face, people abandon me, waited outside my stall in a public restroom-- I was kicked out of my house at 14. And then I had to go through behavioral therapy ""to get fixed,"" which obviously didn't work. There are people who don't belief I actually exist, and then force that belief on me. So I'm constantly afraid. ""Transtrenders"" are not helping. 

TLDR part 1. 
• I'm transgender because of my dysphoria, and my need to socially and medically transition. Because if I don't, I'll continue to be increasingly miserable. Positivity doesn't help. Believe me. I've tried for twelve years straight. It sucks. 
• My dysphoria is dysphoria because it is biological, constant, is diagnosed, it effects my mood, I feel it all over my body, and clothing alone can't alleviate it. So yeah. As soon as I rule out all other possible causes with my therapist, I'm transitioning. The fact that tansitoning is a permanent thing I take seriously, is the only thing stopping me from buying androgel off Amazon to slather it all over myself. 
• I am not a tomboy, I don't simply prefer to appear androgynous, I don't have ""Tumblr softboi UwU"" aesthetic. At all. I'm not doing this to be cute. I have severe dysphoria, and simply do not identify as a man or woman. 
• I'm terrified of how people will treat me because 1, I'm trans *and Black*, and trans *and* Black people get hate crimed/I constantly get the ""Black people don't do that, you just want attention"" speech from family and peers. And 2, non-binary people are highly appropriated so people don't take us seriously. So!

TLDR part 2. To shorten my point further; I *do* in fact exist, and I just wanna live my life, man."

I used to work at an aquarium. A crying father came up to me to tell me that he cant find his two sons. So I tell security and panic and briskly walk around with the dad, looking for them. 

They were right behind us the entire time. Following us. Sniggering. They thought we were playing a hiding game of some kind. They were 3 and didn't know any better. Bless their hearts. But poor Dad.

It makes a good story but goddamn we thought those kids got snatched.

I talk too much, so TL;DR is at the bottom lol. 

My back's and arms' measurements certainly have gone up almost an inch! Not my waist or hips, though, but I'm not focused on the latter two. I don't know if I'm just seeing what I wanna see, but my back is a little broader than I remember :3 But my shoulders look more narrow, now? I've always had a naturally drastic V-taper until two years ago, it seems. 

Last school year, my weight steadily went from 122 to 132, but went down with every vacation. Now that it's summer break, it wont go lower than 125-127. Then again, that's still within my usual range, so I'm not sure if I ""actually"" gained three pounds. Besides. 

That kind of weight gain is normal with age, right? Because your metabolism slows. I'm just now turning 18, but ""freshman 15"" is real. I don't know if what I gained is muscle or fat. But the muscles in my arms *definitely* got bigger; their size when I flex increased a very good amount. Still got stubborn tricep flab, so don't know about them, but my biceps have blown up. Is that gain or ? I dunno. Because at rest, my arms look muscly with squishy triceps, like they always have. 

My mom sometimes asks if I got my hands on hormones as a half-joke, though, lol. She says I'm looking more muscular than she remembers. More lean than curvy. 

TL;DR- All *I* know is that I have been working on my body every other day for almost 12 months, and my measurements and weight definitely have gone up. I *want* it to be muscle, but it very well may be fat. Should have taken progression pictures. Lol."

As a female who grew up as a child of a single mother, whose father did not pay child support, *and* an sexual assault victim, statements like this make me feel nauseous. Not gonna lie. 

It doesn't make a difference. I wasn't aborted, but I wasn't planned for, either. My father did not pay child support. My mother has been harassed by him in and out a courtroom, for over 18 years. He earns six figures as a successful judge and *still* refuses to give me a dime. Unless that dime was for ice cream during visitation. I'm lucky he agreed to that. But my mom had to beg a judge for visitation, too. That man didn't want a kid-- that mad didn't want to *see* me until I turned 18. But I'm lucky he ended up liking me, because some dads run away, and then never even try to come back. That isn't any mom's fault. 

That being said. I agree about not having to pay child support if a child doesn't exist. That's dumb sh*t. Who even made that a thing? Like ?? What sense does it make? Like if someone can explain the purpose to me, I'd feel better about my opinion. But I never did research on it, so excuse me if I'm missing any details. 

I also agree that if the father is in the picture, that it should be worked out between the two. I don't agree with gatekeeping abortions, but ""to abort or not to abort"" is a conversation the parents *should* have. 

However. 

If my assualter got me pregnant, should I have to live with a child who bares his face? Should I not cut him off for 18+ years? Should he tell me what to do?

What if a doctor warned me that if I were to have a baby, I would die? If I would bleed out, if my immune system were to weak-- if I had any rare but possible condition, that made childbirth deadly for me personally. Let's assume the father is in the picture, and the baby was conceived on purpose, and parenthood was mutually planned for. I doubt the daddy is any less torn than I am. But I shouldn't be able to say no to childbirth, still? 

I had a pregnancy scare last year with my boyfriend. We've been dating for two years, now, and we have high regards for one another. I was hiding my late period from him. But I stressed out, and he knows me well, so he knew what was going on. I implied ""other options,"" and he said ""fuck other options. I'm gonna make this work."" (And I knew he was a keeper :3) I wasn't ready for a child, but I didn't want to abort, either. But then he said ""Unless you choose to. That sort of thing is your choice."" And I was so surprised! 

I asked him what he meant and he explained that *I'm* the one who has to walk around my school with a baby belly, whose body will change forever before I turned 20, who will graduate high school with a baby belly. I have to figure out how to buy myself maternity clothes. Id have to change my lifestyle for almost a year as a high school senior. I have to deal with being looked down upon. Who has to come up with a diet plan that nourishes a fetus. Who has to deal with being cooed at. With being shamed and humiliated by strangers and family members. 

At my high school, teenage mothers would be harassed constantly. Kids would joke about punching them in their stomachs. It's high school and terrifying. 

He said it isn't an expectation for me to be okay with dealing with all of that, especially not when we don't even know if we'd be financially ready for a kid in 9 months. It'd be his child, but these things build up bitterness, and tear the happiest of couples apart. So he said it was my ultimate choice. I just have to communicate my thoughts. And promise to never try to hide something like this from him again. He was hurt that I did. (God, I love him so much!! Getchu a mans like him!!) 

And then I got my period two weeks later, and he roasted the shit out of me lol. 

But yeah. We had safe sex and got plan B and everything. We didn't do anything wrong or too late. I wish the stigma around teenage pregnancies would disappear, but that's too much to ask. 

Bottom line. My mans explained ""my body, my choice"" perfectly. It doesn't mean that there's no communication whatsoever. It just means that you're gonna be sick and fat for 9 months straight, ma, can you physically and emotionally handle it? Because mothers kill their babies for all sorts of mental issues, that start with watching their baby belly grow overtime. You have to be in a good place, mentally, too. Not just financially. If you're not ready, you're not ready. 

I'd rather abort than develop post-partum mental illnesses due to the stressors of physically carrying a child; or miscarry because I can't take maturnity leave from school; or be negligent because I can't work and care for a baby and finish my education, all at the same time. I'm not the only person who's like this. 

The mother has to be both physically and mentally ready for the baby. Not just financially. If they aren't, and they can't or aren't willing to make some changes for whatever reason, then the fetus' wellbeing could be in danger. Which is why the option to abort is on the table. That's it, that's all."
unpopularopinion,evpi2b7,t3_ck6q5i,1564673938.0,"A lot of recent episodes are quite critical; I watched so many new episodes yesterday and the series has been making a lot of political statements. I haven't watched many cartoons lately, but it's made that if you want it to be mindless, it's mindless. If you want it to be a political cartoon (or you simply are thinking about what's happening,) then it's a political cartoon. Many cartoons are made like this for several reasons, I believe. So for that reason, (call me biased,) I just agree to disagree."

NonBinaryTalk,evnqx0p,t1_evnldte,1564630295.0,"I'm so happy that it worked out for you, that's so great! 

I will definitely bring up clothes shopping again, this next session. I just gotta stop pussyfooting every three seconds. Maybe I just need to be comfortable with being open?

Thank you so much for your suggestions and support. Honestly, I consider myself lucky. Or fast thinking? I got kicked out at first. But I did what I had to do to not let that be permanent, which at the time, was to just do whatever I was ""supposed"" to. So I lived with my grandma for three days before I came home. Nothing bad happened, just lots of crying and yelling. Which sucked. Like I looked in the mirror and threw up, since I had to change a lot about my appearance for months, for anyone to buy the ""act.""

Which is probably part of why I pussyfoot so much about how I see myself today. I know my own truth, but I'm deathly afraid to come out to literally anyone. Even allies, even LGBT folk. Like my heart and stomach drops, I get sweaty and dizzy, the whole nine yards. But general anxiety about coming out isn't at all uncommon, I don't think.

I think that whole experience itself was more buried than addressed, so I should talk about that if nothing else regardless. It's all connected, so either way works ^_^ the experience socially *jacked* up my freshman year, but made me a lot stronger as a person. It helped me become who I am today, I wasn't physically harmed, and I love myself. So I think it's got a silver lining. 

Thank you for talking to me, and thank for your suggestions and help again! I don't think I would've seen my freshman year as a stepping stone to my transition if we didn't have this little chat of ours : )

(Egads, I type/talk so much, and am sorry you were bombarded with so much, in such little time. Thank you for your respect, time, and patience, my friend!)"
relationships,evhdvp8,t3_cjsil0,1564524832.0,"No it is not normal. 

It's kind of crazy (in a good way) to see how perspective changes your opinion. God, I know what this is like. I always doubt myself when my mother upsetedly blows up my phone or makes meaningful threats, because I forgot or missed a call or text. What she says makes my points seem childish, and what her points seem correct. I feel guilty and overwhelmed and do everything to pacify. It's hard to admit but that's gaslighting. 

Seeing myself in the situation, I sweep it under the rug to deal with it another day. But seeing somebody else-- somebody older than I am, coming close to move out-- I can't stress how important it is for you to stop being afraid. Easier said than done, but you're already a responsible young adult, moving out of the house. 

Let her know (not aggressively, but not passively) that taking control of your life is a part of it. And if she justifies her actions with ""You *do* have control, I'm just worried for your safety"" talk, calmly tell her how you feel. Write and proofread a letter if you have to avoid even slightly raising your voice. I know it might be a passionate subject. But no matter what, no matter how peaceful and nice things are between you two at the time, *do not let anyone tell you how you're supposed to feel.*

I am in the exact same situation as you, and I want you to know that being gaslighted with every slip up is not fair. Do what's right by yourself; if you don't want something, you don't want it. And if you do, you do. The only thing that can make you cruel, ungrateful, or inconsiderate, is the deliberate action of being cruel, ungrateful or inconsiderate. Not the boundaries you want for yourself. So set them. And don't let anything convince you that it is anything but absolutely healthy to do so. 

Good luck and Godspeed to you and yours."

NonBinaryTalk,ev2mzgi,t3_bw12jo,1564180003.0,"1. I choose they/them pronouns because he/him and she/her both make me feel extremely dysphoric. Like. With this kind of dysphoria, it's the same kind of cringe you get from a nickname you outgrew. But amplified, and it feels undeniably false. 

2. Personally, I'm in a place where I'm both confident and closeted. So I question my identity and presentation rarely these days. I do whatever the f*ck I want and don't have to justify it for any reason, so long nobody is effected. If someone asks about my experience then I'll answer; I've realized I was non binary for five years and my ""gender thoughts"" have been consistent throughout my life. Learning that being non binary is thing and is okay to be just helped me accept my dysphoria. 

3. If I like someone, then I like them. I'll do what I can as their significan other to make them happy. Not responsible for their happiness, but I want to help push them to be their best possible self, and vice versa. Same as the almost anyone else. 

4. As a fellow artist, and as a Black non binary person, I. CANT. FIND. ANY. STORY. TROPES. Because non binary folk and culture are so appropriated and misrepresented, and *not enough people takes us seriously because of it,* I hate it when a character (or YouTuber *COUGH COUGH*) turns their struggles as a non binary person into their personality. I am not my dysphoria. Or my skin color. I have hobbies and goals outside of transitioning, and I have a life. Yes, my struggles are real and exist and hijack my life at times, it is not the only f*cking thing I do with my time. 

So all in all just don't forget we're people, too. Have the character aspire to be something like a teacher or a doctor or a dancer. Anything that suits them. I didn't have someone like that to look up to growing up, because all NB YouTubers at the time talked about was trans problems and binders. Not that that's bad, but that's literally all there was. Not enough representation is my one frustration, which is where misrepresentation comes from. Because all you see on media is someone frothing at the mouth about how their cashier called them a ma'am when they dressed entirely feminine that day. Not that it isn't okay to feel dysphoric about it, but, like ??? It's kind of expected?? No offence but nobody can read minds. So people see these sorts of things go viral, and then they don't take *me* seriously and it is so unfair. 

So that's the thing I don't like seeing. 

Good luck!"
NonBinaryTalk,ev2kezr,t3_c0a4x7,1564178604.0,"I wouldn't worry so much about labels, as I would about doing exactly what feels comfortable and natural, instead of what's uncomfortable and unnatural. Just be your genuine self and all will fall into place."

BipolarReddit,eu5r4xo,t3_ccxgew,1563483501.0,"I sure did let little triggering things entirely hijack my mood, but sure did *not* let my mood hijack my behavior, thus hijack my visit with my lovely dingus boyfriend/his wonderful family. It's going great!

I've been making myself walk away instead of feed into the triggers by blowing up or self harming. At most, I've been snarky in response to unusual comments, instead of explosive. And honestly, what an improvement."
witchcraft,etuqbn0,t3_cdlfi6,1563217832.0,"I was in a similar situation when I was first began practicing witch craft. How I didn't let it stop me was a combination of two things:

1) just ignore it. Don't address the psychology behind it, just keep swimming. 

2) logic my way out of it. The only way to stop being so afraid of the unknown, is learning about it. Things become less unfamiliar and mysterious the more you understand it."
