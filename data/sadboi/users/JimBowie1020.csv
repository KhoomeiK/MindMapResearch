So you need to keep moving, you won't bounce anything like you would do in a STB-1 or a E50 M. Don't get me wrong, you can and will have some lucky bounces (I once did almost 2k damage bounce on me), bit it need to be or track shots or your tank si angling that it can't possibly pen so well ... 

The leo is a really hard to play tank. You need to train and train in it, and you will manage to one day do well in it.

relationship_advice,fbetqsf,t3_ed0c7m,1576793729.0,"Between this and the other post, I'd say that he do like toi, and surely a lot. However I migjt be wrong. 

Usually when a guy wants to get closer to someone he likes, he'll try too be closer in a physical way, and see how the other respond. How are you feeling from him touching your elbow ? Would you like him do it more often ? That's the kind if questions you have to ask yourself. 

After, does he loves you ? Would you two have a chance together ? You've got only one way to find out. As I said earlier, he might be in love with you. But he might also not be in love with you, you never know.

My advice here is or do the first move: go on and ask him on a date. He's only 13, he might surely not be really confortable enough with these feelings, and not really have the guts to ask you out on a date (which is fine, don't get me wrong). Do the first move, and he will appreciate it if he loves you back. And if he doesn't loves you, you can still be friends. But it'll hurt to be rejected, trust me, I've been there.
