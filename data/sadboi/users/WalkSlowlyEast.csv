Anxietyhelp,fqcixg9,t3_gi3iez,1589259409.0,I'm always looking for good calming music. It helps me too. Thanks.
mentalhealth,fneerns,t3_g19qmn,1586888070.0,"I'm glad you posted this. I have had many people say ""keep doing it even if it feels bad now, it gets worse before it gets better"" this has kept me seeing therapists and doing therapies that I have later realized were destructive. This idea of ""it gets worse before it gets better"" can trap us, because it can override are own intuition and common sense. It could potentially keep us doing a therapy or seeing a therapist for a long time even if they are hurting us. After I learned to trust my deeper sense a bit more (even with a fractured mind) I have been better able to navigate some of the traps like these in the world of therapy and therapists. Ultimately, it was compassion for myself and thinking about how I would act if someone else was going through the same situation as me that allowed me to see the truth of it."
Anxietyhelp,fncdvhq,t3_g0lh7h,1586834388.0,The last one is on point.
Anxiety,fnc7q2u,t3_g0pccb,1586830415.0,I just so happened to see this post while I'm currently sipping tea in bed.
mentalillness,fm6fsoe,t1_fm5cro7,1585793091.0,"Yes I have. When I first developed my mental illness I went to many therapists, psychiatrists and others. I also spent a lot of time trying to understand what I was going through and how to manage. I learned that seeing all these people and trying all these different modalities was, in part, making things worse. The best therapist I found helped me trust myself more and do what I felt I needed to do rather than follow advice that didn't seem to be helping. When I started doing this, I finally started to improve. Sometimes I will do things that seem counterintuitive or even against common therapy views. This can be hard, but my therapist gives me more confidence to trust my own understanding of things, and has been helpful. Sometimes it gets to much though, and  my will gets broken down to the point where I just hold myself in a bubble of compassion and give it time."
mentalhealth,fm6f5nh,t1_fm5lg2d,1585792694.0,Yes. That is an important point. Self care different for everyone.
mentalillness,fm6f04a,t1_fm3giqk,1585792598.0,"Well said. I agree with all of this. Thank you. I also remind myself not to see things black and white, and that I am looking through a clouded lens. I know that life has beauty and peace. I may not be able to see it now, but that does not mean I am destined to feel like this forever. This realistic view is still here and  helps keep me going, but it can become obscured by the storm of painful feelings and intrusive thoughts."
overcoming,fm3ag6h,t3_fsfa74,1585717269.0,"I love it when people say ""take as much time as you need."" I often feel bad for taking things slow and not doing too much, even though it is almost always helpful for me. I know it is the right thing to do, but I still have my doubts. It give me more strength to do the right thing and take it easy when  people say this. The correct type of support from others can be so helpful."
mentalillness,flwlrk4,t3_frc2sr,1585555494.0,"I can see that things have been difficult for you and you have suffered a lot. I think being abused and bullied is a big deal and can damage us deeply. Also, mental illness is so painful and confusing. It makes me sad to hear you have experienced these things. 

I can't truly know your experience, because only you can know that, but I can talk about my own experience. I have found that I have treated others much kinder than myself. When I started looking at my own situation as if it was that of a stranger or friend, I noticed how harsh I was to myself. I found, through using this different point of view, I could more easily offer myself gentleness. I became less focused on being perfect or succesfull and valued my peace and happiness more.

 Sometimes I would also think about myself when I was just a few years old. I would think of what life I would want for myself when I was this age. I noticed I just wanted this person to be happy and not suffer. I realised that is really what I want now and that's really what everyone wants. This allowed me to not care so much about not being attractive, or not having any money, or not living up to my parents expectations. 

I'm not sure if this is at all helpful. I thought I would share with you somethings that helped me through the labrynth of my dark and damaged mind. 

Life can be so confusing and painful, but it makes things much better when we help each other through. I'm glad you want to be heard  I sincerily wish you well, but maybe more importantly, I wish for you to have strength."
mentalhealth,flw0oqo,t3_fr91du,1585536669.0,Sorry to here this. How are you doing these days?
mentalhealth,flq7xkt,t3_fjhg9s,1585382888.0,"It is good to hear that a doctor would give such compassionate and understanding advice. I have only ever had one person give me advice like that. So often people try and force me beyond my limit and it just ends up making things worse for my anxiety. I had to develope enough strength to validate myself. It is so much better to have proper external support like this than need to rely completly on inner strength and resolve that your anxiety is real, valid and just as crippling as any other illness."
mentalhealth,flq7coi,t1_fkvtn3y,1585382169.0,"A lot of broken people too, me included."
mentalhealth,flq79p3,t1_fkugi0e,1585382070.0,"Yes, I think genuine compassion is so important in this world. I think it is vital to making things better for all of us. It is almost like an advanced type of intelligence, often learned through the types of suffering many of us, here, have experienced. But, I don't think this reality is harsh. I think even with all the suffering there is still the possibility for beauty, awe, love and joy."
mentalhealth,flq6mc4,t3_fdygh2,1585381271.0,"Yeah, I feel the same way right now. I just don't want to have to explain myself anymore, and I don't feel like talking about trivial thing. I would much rather have some peace and silence to myself or even with someone else who also enjoys  silence. I also like being around my pets more than people. I like that they offer non-judgmental company. I don't think It's that I don't want to be around people, it's that I want to be around the right people."
mentalhealth,flq5va9,t1_fllswei,1585380359.0,"I'm 29, suffered five years of mental illness and live with my Mom. I've been trying hard to improve my situation, but it feels like running on a treadmil. Sometimes I get very negative and feel hopeless. More frequently, however, I feel compassion for myself and realize that I can only do so much given my damaged mind. I have an RV that I'm fixing up to live in. I can only work on it a few hours a day, but at least its something. I just try to move forward a little bit at a time, when I can, and don't think too much about how long I will be I'll or how much time I feel I have lost. What more can I do? When I saw this more clearly I have suffered less and my condition has even slowly improved. I think it is never to late to have an extrodinary life. I hope my time will come and I hope yours will to."
Anxiety,ficegnw,t3_f7c4vy,1582344769.0,"As a fellow sufferer, I sincerely wish you well. It must have been very painful for you to be miserable for so long. Iâ€™m glad you are doing what you can to get better."
Anxiety,fi9hvzp,t3_f6z1hd,1582266472.0,"I had a similiar experience when I began to come out of dissociation. I was more functional and got more things done when I was dissociated. When I started to feel things more strongly and became less numb, things seemed more intense. It was a roller coaster ride. I would sometimes get so mad (i'm not normally an angry-type person). I would bounce between dissociating, feeling somewhat okay, intense anxiety and absolute-freakout-mode. I often wondered if it would be better if I just stayed dissociated.  

I reached a turning point when I realised that I needed to be more accepting of the fact that I, temporarily, wouldn't be able to function at the same level as when I was strongly dissociated.  I needed to take things slow and prioritize my healing. But at the same time, as I dialed my life back in order to heal, I often felt like I was failing myself and my family by not pursuing my career, missing many family gatherings, and generally not moving ahead in life (in a material sense). 

One of the the hardest things I have done (but now I know was neccasary) was having enough compassion for myself to find the strength to do what I know I had to do despite the pressure to do the opposite from society, my family and myself. 

It hasn't always been pretty, but I have muddled my way through and am doing much better. I have realised, definitively, that dissociating is not worth it. Please, stay strong. I wish with all my heart that you get out of this horrible state and get to experience the beauty, owe, and love you deserve."
