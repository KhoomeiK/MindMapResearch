socialskills,eyxy70n,t3_cz8qvl,1567565659.0,"Man i really feel this. Ive always been the kid with like one or two friends at a time, never had a group of friends. And I honestly can say socialskills is like a muscle you got to constantly work. I constantly feel out of touch with people im not great at holding a conversation, most people look at me weird for not knowing social norms. I do my best at being better, but it can get really frustrating sometimes when you look at it in a negative perspective which i try my best at switching my mindset."
depression,ewp0k17,t3_cp1ajy,1565630811.0,"I think this is honestly just a common symptom of depression. When your in a shitty mood and not really up for things it’s obvious you wont  want to be very social or outgoing, not that anything is wrong with you or that you cant relate to anybody. Your just letting your depression keep you alone. Practice self care go to the gym, eat clean amd read or listen to positive intriguing topics. And dont forget tell yourself everyday that im a not my depression."

socialskills,esm44fr,t3_c88693,1562097845.0,This really hit home because its almost like someone literally said what i been feeling for years and spoke my truth for me. I cant begin to tell to even explain how much this post has explained my experience. Im female too and its do hard to relate when it seems only males talk about things like this.
