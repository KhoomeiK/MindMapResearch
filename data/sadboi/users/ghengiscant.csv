Ask yourself if anything he said was true, maybe he really wasn't keeping track and legitimately thought you guys were pretty even. Maybe he does contribute in other ways. Or maybe if non of it was true hes just a deadbeat.  

 I'm a person who doesnt keep track of money but that's also with someone I've been with for much longer and I make more so it's not as big of an issue for me. As long as the contribution is the same or at least the effort is equal money isnt that important.

  But also seems like a breakup might he right for you two. If you asked that question and it was in a non offensive way, if he didnt realize you were paying for more he could've  said so. If he did realize he could've presented what he was doing to make up for the spending difference, (eg house work, fixing your car, landscaping, services that would save you money)

The rest of your post looks like he was alreadylooking for a way out but was comfortable staying around because you were paying for stuff. Sane people who want to stay in a relationship dont let something like this force them out, they talk it out"

Based only on this video

Innocence, check (not the aggressor)  
Immenece, check (guy had a weapon and could lash.  out)  
Proportionally, check (stopped punching once threat was over)  
Avoidance, ehh arguable.   
Reasonable, check.
