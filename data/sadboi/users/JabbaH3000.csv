SuicideWatch,exetd4h,t3_csfaq8,1566224863.0,"Your attempt failing is a sign that whatever the situation you must always try and keep going. I dont know what people you have in your life but by killing yourself you only push the pain and horror onto someone else. The present might seem bleak but the future is always a little better, so keep aiming for that."
SuicideWatch,exccir5,t3_cs1zy6,1566147502.0,See this one failure as a sign to keep going. At the bottom you can only go up (cliche i know). You clearly still have a sense of humour and i hope that means there is still some hope that you deep inside haven't given up yet.

AmItheAsshole,er4ozrr,t3_c08awt,1560502533.0,"NTA. She clearly tried to keep you from succes and expected you to fail completely. Now that you've made it and are succesfull, she realises she fucked up and probably hopes for some form of financial stability from you. Rubbing in her face that you are succesfull despite her pulling you down for years is, in my eyes, more then justified"
