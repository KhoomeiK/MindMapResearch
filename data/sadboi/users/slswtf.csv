Or else I would probably only have one of each color if they were sold in singles. And I don’t NEED them. They’re just fun and make me happy, can’t really describe it.

youngadults,fof3fm6,t3_g710ub,1587724630.0,"Hi! Apartment requirements really depend on your state and the complex but I will try to help! Most places require you to have proof of income and that you make at least 3x the rent + good credit.  If not prepare to have a co-signer or someone else sign for you completely. My parents had to co-sign for both of my apartments bc I have no credit. 
Don’t believe everything the leasers tell you by mouth, please do your own research and inspect the unit that you would be potentially moving into.  (One of my units had broken locks, window panes, and damp carpet around the back door. I requested everything be fixed before I moved in.) And please god read your lease entirely! 

As far as roommates go, I’ve never lived with a random person but I have lived with a SO (now ex) and by myself! If you plan to live with someone else have a Plan B and C incase anything gets messy. Check your lease for rules about removing roommates and such. 

I preferred living alone just because I had control over my own space entirely. No one leaving my lights on or not flushing their poo. Bills will be lower with just you, but rent will be higher, so you kind of have to decide what you’re willing to sacrifice, your money or your sanity. But if you have a really good friend that you never fight with, they might make a great roommate! I also hate people and prefer to be alone with most things I do so it also depends on your personality. (Plus I was an only child and never had to share my sh*t). I really don’t suggest living with a random though because most people I know have not had a good experience doing so. 

Pets make the best roommates even though the don’t pay bills :) 
I hope this helped at least somewhat!"

I am also the kind of person that likes to have my favorite things in every color (got a rainbow of workout pants too).  So sometimes I wonder if I’m over doing it. But I’ve built this collection over the course of 3 years. Just wanted to vent.

I’ve been able to catch up on all my school (I’m even ahead which is insane bc I’m a pro-procrastinator) finish my endless laundry, deep clean down to the baseboards, finish my half done crafts, and not feel guilty about any of it! Because no one is contacting me to make plans! So I don’t have to tell anyone no OR be in crowded public places wishing I wasn’t! The only down side is I’m going broke. But I do feel for all those that are not having a good time right now."

AskWomen,f7qfeca,t1_f7pbfwk,1573963118.0,"When I was breaking up with my ex he barred me from leaving the closet while I was trying to collect my things and bucked up at me saying “what’re you gonna do about it, hit me?”  after asking him to move several times. Then proceeded to call me crazy and scream for help on the front porch of our apartment when I showed him I was armed. He’s also called my parents and said I kicked in the door , pointed a gun to him and demanded money. Luckily I had been recording the whole thing without his knowledge. Needless to say he ended up looking very stupid. Tried to guilt trip me several times into “working things out”. I had already given him many chances to change. And yet somehow you still end up feeling bad for being mean to someone that treated you like shit because you genuinely cared for them. It started small like calling me bitch, breaking things then progressed to wrecking the house, demanding I clean up his tantrum mess, throwing things at me, and shoving me. It’s always great at first then progressively get shittier. He had a good side, but the bad side didn’t make the good side worth staying around for. The good times should never ever excuse the abuse.
EDIT: my blinders didn’t come off until he lost my cat and didn’t give a fuck or help me look. And by “lost” I mean let him outside at 3 am when I was asleep because he was “annoying him”. That cat was the only thing that made me love life. I’m still depressed from losing my kitty and it’s been over 2 years. It was the strongest bond I’ve ever had with any creature."

One of the absolute hardest times in my life lead me to a beautiful new beginning and if I hadn’t gone through that then I would probably still be unsatisfied but doing nothing about it.

I took a personality test recently and turns out I’m 94% introverted (shockerrr). The test is very reliable, I’ve gotten the same results since high school but my introversion increases every few years.  It also gave me some insight into why I am the way I am and why no one else is like me. I have a rare type especially for women but it helped me see that there’s nothing really wrong with hating those things, I’m just different. I don’t mesh with all those bubbly women that have large friend groups and go on trips together. I’d rather read a book in a cabin alone.

My periods have gotten lighter (2-4 days instead of 4-6) which is pretty enjoyable. They’re extremely effective if you take them correctly. I really don’t think it’s anything to be scared of but there are so many more options than just the pill if that doesn’t suit your lifestyle. And there’s no harm in trying something and not liking it, you don’t know till you try it for yourself anyways."
