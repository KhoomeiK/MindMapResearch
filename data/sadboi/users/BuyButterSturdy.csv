I saw him as a child just watching me at the door until I was about 8... I shrugged it off as an adult thinking “it was my child like imagination and fear of the dark.” Then I watched “The Nightmare” on Netflix at the age of 25. My heart sank as people I had never heard of, spoke to, etc, began speaking of and describing the exact “thing” I’d seen looking over me most of my childhood nights. I literally have never been so freaked out in my entire life. I don’t believe in much, and I’m still not sure what exactly to believe in here.. but holy f*ck man. That’s gotta be more than coincidence. A LOT MORE"

For it to hurt more when he leaves. I mean we forget sometimes that he has dyspraxia making him being a “knight in shining armor” type character sort of endearing, if you don’t get hung up on gender stereotypes and simply see it for that alone."

mentalillness,exg8n5m,t1_exg6a2j,1566257936.0,"Its never easy for the one suffering or their loved ones, and mental illness can cause thoughts/feelings that are almost never grounded in logic. We know that and sometimes knowing makes it even harder. Maybe you both need to put yourselves first for awhile - together. When things feel better, take advantage of it and see the other loved ones in your life, but it doesnt have to exist around special occasions or big plans. It seems my MDD worsens around big events/special occasions although i still have not figured out exactly why. Just remember these issues have outcomes that are not personal. 

Take time for yourselves.. learn more about, support, and even just hold one another a little bit more each day. There is no rush because this very moment is all you have.. I can tell you care and that is the most important thing to someone with mental illness. we are aware our situation makes it difficult for others but to remember we are still loved for who we are, including what we have become, can sometimes mean more than we can ever say. forget the occasions... plan life in the ways that work for you both."
mentalillness,exg5r3b,t1_exg1erc,1566256097.0,"I think Alida is right - that being said, have you tried talking to her? Not at her or prying infrmation.. but just a simple ""do you want to talk about anyting?"" or ""are you okay"" 

I dont mean this to be insulting as this may have been your initial approach. I just know from personal experience with MDD, i tend to sort of craw inside myself and heavily withdraw.. only because i think thats what I need and also because i both 1) feel i will be judged/left alone for all of my thoughts/actions (or lack there of) and/or because 2) i don't have the words to communicate and i feel that trying to articulate them to loved ones would just weigh them down.

My S.O. and i have figured out that communicating actually works wonders for me.. something I never would have known if he had never asked as well as proceeded to be there/supportive even when I found it hard to talk"
