30PlusSkinCare,fo2f8zf,t3_g58n4l,1587460150.0,"Burn the St. Ives clearing scrub :) 

edit: harsh scrubs cause micro-tears in the skin. 

You should use a hydrating facial cleanser from ceraVe followed by a moisturiser from ceraVe too. It’s personally my fav and it’s I’ve used it for over 12 months and I’m never going back :) 

Introduce retinol.. I personally use a prescription strength. It’s great for fine lines etc 

Use sunscreen. It’s a great prevention in premature ageing

If you wear make up use an oil cleanser prior to using your cleanser. This is great for removing dirt etc that would otherwise clog your pores and cause acne etc

edit: It’s all about trial and error. Do what’s best for you 💕"
