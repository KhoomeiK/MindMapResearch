There is no sign of effort, no obvious speed, no feeling of artistry, in fact a rather dull proposition to observe, yet he was by far the fastest driver on the circuit. There must be a lesson there somewhere.""

Prost was deceptive in how fast he was on track and a lot of people slept on how good he was. He was not a spectacular driver in the vein of Ronnie Peterson or Jim Clark. He played the political game well, probably better than any driver which didn't sit well with contemporaries. You can name great drives by a lot of the top tier drivers...when it comes to Prost, is there any that really stood out? Plus as mentioned by plenty, the Senna documentary did him no favors. They needed a villain and he was an easy one to cast in that role. 

A lot of people don't realize he was in contention to win 8 world titles rather than the 4 he won: 1983, 1984, 1988, and 1990. If half points aren't awarded at Monaco in '84, the driver's title would have gone to him, and in '88 the points system meant Senna had a chance to ultimately win. A roll of the dice in 4 seasons and Prost would have gone into the record books with more titles than any driver in history. He was a great driver who was always in control."

That was the biggest issue at the time, the screenshots did nothing to convey any sense of the animation of the game.

motogp,f96vae3,t1_f92uu83,1575152881.0,"The 500's Rossi rode were nothing like the bikes that Lawson, Schwantz, and Rainey rode. They were far more user friendly than they had ever been."

formula1,f86u2ar,t1_f86spkg,1574306930.0,"I'll admit I'm biased towards the F1 of yesterday, but the cars were beautiful in those days. Today's cars don't even come close to matching them in sheer looks. While far faster than those cars obviously, I'd much rather watch the cars of past eras circle the track."

I don't know how to get it on meds but I'm spite of the obvious drawbacks to being off meds, it's the only way I can do job interviews with enthusiasm tbh."
motogp,f835k5x,t3_dylxme,1574204816.0,"Yes the statement has been true for decades. 

One has to look no further than Mike ""The Bike"" Hailwood. Even beyond him, you had King Kenny, Freddie Spencer, Steady Eddie Lawson, Wayne Rainey, Kevin Schwantz, Michael Doohan, Casey Stoner, and now Marc Marquez.

Superior talent can make up for bike deficiencies. But it takes very special talent to do that. Finding once in a generation riders is extremely difficult, and when you do find them, they don't disappoint."
motogp,f7twezp,t1_f7swf4u,1574008289.0,I wouldn't put Valentino's 2002 in there because he was running against half a grid of 500cc bikes and Barros didn't even get the V5 Honda till late in the season.

bipolar,f7d1i4z,t3_dvdb64,1573605200.0,"Absolutely. I also have a zero to hundred temper. When I get pissed, it's like flipping a light switch. It's been that way since childhood. I have to have an internal fight with myself to not react externally to things because on the occasions that I have, it's been horrific. The last time I couldn't control it, I hit someone with a 15 pound bowling ball. That was bad."
