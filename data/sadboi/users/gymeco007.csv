OCD,fpwtx6g,t3_g3d3ni,1588969907.0,"In an ocd case guilt is like doubt, it comes with this illiness. Thats what my doctor said. 

Guilt is like doubt because we can always find something to feel guilty about, but usually non ocd people just put the idea aside like they can usually put their doubts aside.

Reading this subreddit is the proof that it is not the what are you feeling guilty about, ( a looooot of stories here), so you have to understand that the subject of your guilt is not really what matters but your OCD...
I have also heard from a doctor that guilt comes as an emotion before even having an idea or a memory... then as ocd is in the game we start to look for something to stick it on this guilt.

From my experience you should try to be patient and remind yourself that all the people made mistakes, or whatever , and that what you are feeling is due to ocd and not the actions themselves.
Good luck"

Everybody can find something to feel guilty about, since everybody has made mistakes ( big and small ) but the non-ocd people don't just sit and blame their selves for it they just put it aside, just like they don't sit overthinking doubts and stuff they are not certain about. I hope you got my point.

Additionally, guilt is something that comes with OCD, that's what a doctor said to me one day. More than that he specified that the emotion of guilt comes before even having any reason to it, then our thoughts try to find a reason to feel guilty and it attaches to the emotion. Well in this reddit you will find people feeling guilty for a lot of different reasons, this is the proof that it not about the subject but it is about the illiness.

It is a bit weird because I feel that I am not allowed to be happy or to be successful in life 'cause it will maybe hurt the person I have wronged.

Concerning my own experience I have this problem of guilt, and after a bit of time you just realize you are behaving unormaly toward your mistakes, I havent totally overcome this but, I am pretty sure we behave unormaly toward our mistake, just like a person who have fear of germs behave excessively when thinking they may have even just one bacteria in their skin, while other people just dont fucking care...

Firstly medication helped me a lot, i can't understand people who say i don't want medication, if you real suffer you would eat shit... You have to find a good therapist who can give you REASONABLE medication.

Secondly,  three things can help, and they are really important in my opinion to maintain ocd at the best level accordind to your condition.
1 _  sleep well and don't stay awake too late, not over midnight in my case. Sleeping well really helps you brain relax and have a good break.
2 _ exercise. Doing sports, especially smooth cardio sports, helps to relax you body and mind, it is no longer necessary to prove it, since so many medical studies says it has good outcomes for the body and mind
3 _ eat reasonably well. I am not saying you should have a perfect diet but, avoid extra sugar and extra fats helps to stabilise mood. 

In addition, some supplements may help, according to medical studies, like omega 3 fatty acid. And magnesium."
