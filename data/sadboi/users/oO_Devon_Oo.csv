Narcolepsy,fqewp1r,t1_fq87bg4,1589314838.0,"yep this is exactly what happens to me. a quick switch from keto doesn‚Äôt give your body time to make the metabolic change (produce the chemicals needed to break down glucose, adjust water retention and electrolyte balances, ...). first time I went off keto (which stopped me from cheating for a looong time - until I had a holiday break) I slept 31 hrs and then got up and had all those other fun symptoms.

I asked my doctor about flumazenil, but they said that insurance would never approve it, bc it's not indicated for sleep disorders. Were you prescribed it for a different condition, or for this?

I‚Äôd say my tolerance for emotional and physical pain has greatly increased.
selfharm,f1wb730,t1_f1w9u0p,1569782565.0,Wow! I can‚Äôt even imagine doing that. You must have incredible perseverance!
selfharm,f1w9hb1,t1_f1w8sdw,1569781990.0,"There you go! Tho I‚Äôm not sure if you put ‚Äúgood at lying‚Äù bc you like that or just bc you are good at it lol 

What kinds of things do you teach yourself?"
selfharm,f1w7y1x,t1_f1w5lma,1569781427.0,"That sounds really rough. Depression shifts your perspective on everything. How about this - can you write 5 things you like about yourself?

I‚Äôll write a list now, too:
1. My smile
2. My resilience
3. My love of science
4. My nails
5. My honesty"
selfharm,f1w57qk,t1_f1w2u4z,1569780397.0,"I completely get that:( 

Buuuut bc I‚Äôm a huge science nerd, I have to say that you are incredible!! You have close to 100 billion neurons. And each of those neurons connects to  about 7,000 others! It‚Äôs like a superhighway for processing, with 1,000 TRILLION roads to travel. You look at this text and see words instead of shapes. When you look at the sentences, you draw meaning out of them. You have molecules in your body which carry out complex reactions in fractions of a second. Whereas in nature, those same reactions could take millions of years! You control your heart rate, blood pressure, breathing, temperature and so much more, without even a thought. You adapt to situations by understanding cultural norms, and by observing other people‚Äôs behavior. You need only to think about it, and your muscles will go into action to get you where you want to go. And you do all of this (and so so much more) while being weighed down by depression. Imagine how incredible your powers will be when you‚Äôre feeling better!"

selfharm,f1vzq35,t1_f1vzf2a,1569778237.0,Ooh that was a good one! It def made up for the ending of infinity war. How about music?
