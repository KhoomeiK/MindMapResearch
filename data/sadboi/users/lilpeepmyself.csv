SuicideWatch,fn8a7zl,t1_fn85mo4,1586737195.0,"I used to like playing video games and even competing in several competitive tournaments.

I used to enjoy art, although I never really made anything that wasnt horrible and disfigured

I used to enjoy playing basketball until i injured my leg because I fell the wrong way

I used to enjoy watching movies, tv shows, and anime 

I used to enjoy learning about history. But that was when I was young

I used to like listening to music.

I used to like singing, although I don't like it now"

depression,fmxz7od,t1_fmxwho2,1586474804.0,"Also, I honestly don't know where to find these fabled therapists. They are a mystery to me. Idk where to go, how much they cost, or if they're useful. I had a doctor's appointment a few months back and he said that he wanted to see me again some time the next month, but that was back in February and he hasn't called my family back at all. So I'm not sure what to do"
depression,fmxwxip,t1_fmxwho2,1586473497.0,Maybe. But with the social distancing and covid crisis I don't know if there are even any services available now. And if there are I have no idea how much it would cost.

SuicideWatch,fl8xmlc,t1_fl8x382,1584934958.0,"Well not a video of me actually doing it. But like a voice memo to replace a suicide note. 

And I'd rather not elaborate more, at least not publicly in replies. Because it's a long, personal story."
SuicideWatch,fl5sif3,t1_fl53hhy,1584844575.0,"The consequences would for everyone knowing would be stigma and annoying conversations with people that I don't want to have. I was exaggerating when I said millions of people.

Routine is inescapable because of financial difficulties. And no matter what you decide to do, life is fundamentally the same every day, so in a way life is and will always be a long standing routine.

I didn't ever finish any music but I tried to make music for a time, I quit because I just didn't like it and I wasn't improving."
SuicideWatch,fl291i8,t1_fl28n6y,1584745652.0,"I don't like doing it that way because I don't like showing these types of things to people. I don't like sharing, unless I'm anonymous, because then there are no consequences. I'd much rather die in silence without anyone knowing than having millions of people know.

All life is, is a monotone day to day routine that is inescapable. You work for 60 years and then you die.

Idk if this is something I'd like to do, it's just something to kill time at the moment, something I can do instead of sleeping all day."
SuicideWatch,fl286j3,t1_fl27qii,1584745102.0,"I've thought about it. But I just don't like doing it.

Well what I haven't been able to be entertained for a while. Everything is so boring and life is so boring as well. Something being entertaining doesn't really mean much to me, it's just something that would be good to have I guess.

I have never completed the game"
SuicideWatch,fl26rgd,t1_fl26hd2,1584744194.0,"I don't know if it would help.

I guess, I've just been using video games as a time killer, it hasn't been too entertaining as of lately.

I did it by following youtube videos closely. But I still can't do it that well."
SuicideWatch,fkzdoch,t1_fkza8i4,1584668577.0,"Someone caring about me would be listening to me and not saying that all of my problems are not important and don't matter.

I don't really enjoy cooking that much to want to cook something new. So I don't know

You speedrun the game through many simple and easy glitches. That are easy to do."
SuicideWatch,fkza1jr,t1_fkz8dum,1584666181.0,"They don't care about me. They have their own issues. It doesn't make me feel any better or worse, they are just annoying.

I don't cook well. But what everyone can cook is noodles, eggs, pancakes, and basic white rice. But that's the extent of everything I can cook. Everyone can at least cook those.

I used to speedrun breath of the wild, the game is supposed to be beaten in over 100 hours but I managed to beat it in just under an hour."
SuicideWatch,fkz7ztg,t1_fkz7o5b,1584664842.0,"I don't feel good about doing that. Talking to family sucks

Well what clicks in my head is very simple tasks, like playing a game or cooking basic things. It doesn't really feel like anything when I do something like that since pretty much everyone can do things like this.

I enjoy just mining mostly. It's the easiest and most simple thing for my little brain to handle"
SuicideWatch,fkwk3u4,t1_fkovj9p,1584594960.0,"I've never thought about telling them anything

Doing something right means everything, if you can't succeed in anything than in my opinion you're pretty useless. I don't know, I just don't learn things at all, nothing ver cliques with my brain most of the time I guess.

I enjoy the simplicity and how easy minecraft is."
SuicideWatch,fkouuo7,t1_fkossdg,1584395509.0,"I mess up by not learning how to do things despite effort. I'm inept at everything so I never succeed in everything I do.

I main falco

I have no idea how I'd want them to support me"
SuicideWatch,fklg0tt,t1_fklcu0y,1584305515.0,"What makes me feel like I won't improve is the amount of things that I don't do right, I cant even do easy things like doing my laundry or cooking without messing up entirely. And that's the same with things I would do before I lost interest in life.

I have been playing it for about 3 or 4 years

I just feel like they say the exact same things to me and it feels like a broken record."
SuicideWatch,fklckq6,t1_fklbeul,1584303383.0,"Success is results and improvement with things that you try to improve in.

I don't have a favorite game, but if I had to pick one it would have to be smash bros melee, it's the game I used to compete in for money actually.

I'm aware of services on the phone but personally they don't work for me, suicide hotlines especially."
SuicideWatch,fklb1we,t1_fkl73ik,1584302409.0,"What makes me feel like I won't improve about anything is the amount of time I take with things without success. I'm inept at anything and everything.

Video games I were interested when I didnt lose interest in everything is, super smash bros melee, persona 5, god of war, zelda breath of the wild, minecraft, osu, last of us, red dead redemption, and a few others
 
And I'm not against talking on the phone with people, I don't mind"
SuicideWatch,fkfhept,t1_fkfgdry,1584134451.0,"Well fucking up for me is wasting years upon years working at something that you will never improve at.

My interests before used to include, sleeping, playing video games (sometimes competitively in a tournament setting for money), playing guitar, making music, listening to music, watching tv shows and movies, and probably more stuff I can't think of.

I never knew my father, my mother is an addict, my other family is across the country, and I have tried to talk to services but I'm poor so I cannot afford therapy, and they won't take my insurance."
SuicideWatch,fkffqjd,t1_fkfeqfu,1584133402.0,"I have never done anything right. Even small things like doing laundry or cleaning, I absolutely don't do right despite effort. Anything I do I fuck up, I don't talk to people right, despite practice and trying to do better, no improvement. I tried art, music, sports, etc to no success, and I spent years on years on these things. I have no interest in things anymore.

I have no family who I can talk to right now. They are out of the picture. And I don't and will never have friends online or off. I'm not very interesting and I am not friend material."
