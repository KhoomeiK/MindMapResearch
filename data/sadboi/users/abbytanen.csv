BPD,fdj0z77,t3_elm07i,1578455670.0,"I really relate to this. Hopelessness. And the worst part is I don‚Äôt even know if I‚Äôm really that hopeless. someone I like can text me and immediately I‚Äôm over the moon and then an hour later, hopeless again. It‚Äôs a tough illness but in those trying times I try to ask myself what would I tell a friend going through this?

What would I tell a friend who is feeling stuck, empty, suicidal and worthless?
I would tell them that they are inherently worthy and valuable as is every human being. We‚Äôre born that way.
Then I would swear on everything that this will pass and that they can fucking handle it and get through it and to just take it easy. Cut yourself some slack and do things that bring you comfort and relief. I would tell them they didn‚Äôt ask for this and they did nothing to deserve feeling this way. Mourn the reality of the disease and then accept that you have it and be grateful for the good things like my BPD brought me this subreddit and the ability to feel less alone and be of service to others"
