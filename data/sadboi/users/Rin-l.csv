bipolar,fqbusq3,t1_fq8gg49,1589244337.0,"Oh i know what that's like, I'm sorry that it's bad for you, it really sucks, hang in there, and stick to routine and meds, i know it sounds repetitive but it actually works and makes relapses less severe and less frequent.

And when you really can't take it anymore and you don't wanna talk to your friends and family, or even your therapist, talking about it here is good too, especially that we all know what it's like and could easily empathise and share information of what helps and what doesn't."

bipolar,fqbspcx,t3_ghvx4m,1589243168.0,"I take 250 mg of lametrogine with 300 mg seroquel, they work perfectly for me, sometimes when i forget to take one of them, seroquel has sever withdrawal symptoms, while lametrogine has almost none, as for side effects, lametrogine has no side effects on me, while seroquel makes me hungry all the time, sleepy, dizzy and all that jazz.

So bottom line, lametrogine has almost no negative impact on me. :)

I also know a few people who are on it and they don't have any issues either

P.s I'm also type 2"

After my medication and proper self care, I realized that mania and hypomania was crap, it gave me false feelings of being awesome, It heightened my emotions like crazy, I was angry all the time, i drove recklessly, i got into arguements, i barely worked and only chattered with my coworkers, and i spent too much money, drank too much, smoked too much, it was hell.

BipolarReddit,f9rykoz,t1_f9rvnk5,1575583115.0,"Well, before i started both those medications i was at a very low point in my life, and had a suicide attempt, and after I started taking them, it took me around 3 months to be better and lose all anxiety that didn't have a real cause, meanwhile i was given benzos to stay calm, so if you're in a bad place, it is normal to feel anxiety, and ironically in my case, i was getting anxious that the medication isn't working :) 

but it all worked out in the end, with patience and working on the quality of my life, i also made it my goal to focus on getting better, it took time, but it worked, I've never felt healthier.

Don't be anxious about the medication, focus on taking it on time and sticking to it, if it doesn't work your doctor will know. And you'll change it. Simple as that. Don't overthink it, let your doctor do that lol"
BipolarReddit,f9rvaga,t3_e6j8e8,1575581789.0,"I've been on 250 mg lamotrigine for about 2 years, never made me irritated, it actually helped me so much with my depressive episodes, i also haven't been suicidal since then, however, I've also been on quetiapine 400 mg for those 2 years and I've started taking them at the same time, they work great together, only had 1 serious manic episode since then, and maybe 2 to 3 serious depressive episodes.

Im not sure if it's just not working for you, or if it has those side effects. But for me, I've never had any problems with it.

Edit: that being said i think for a lot of patients some medication needs more time to take it's actual effect, so give yourself a month."

, and of course there are those random shopping sprees where i see something that looks extremely interesting to my manic self, like this dumb toy called Otamatone, at least i play with this one from time to time, i also tend to buy harry potter wands when im manic, because i think i need to have the whole collection, what a waste of money, they're nice to have but useless as fuck, don't know what I'll do with them when i have all of them. P.s i am manic right now"
