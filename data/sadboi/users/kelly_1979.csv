abusiveparents,fpr1ljq,t3_geus9j,1588839166.0,"I'm not really the best person to say this since I'm still staying with them but why don't you go NC.
Block them, don't reply and maybe change your number.
You deserve you be free from their abusive behavior."
DysfunctionalFamily,fo2ex6r,t3_g53etb,1587459782.0,"Sorry to say this but
1. You shouldn't even be reading this.
2. Be your own self. This is just between your mother and father. If you think your father is not treating you well sit down and have a talk with him or find another role model."
traaaaaaannnnnnnnnns,fkyr8la,t3_flf407,1584654470.0,"Same... Hrt and laser postponed for at least 1 month. :(
Plus having deliberating CFS / adrenal fatigue makes it suck unbelievably much...."
adrenalfatigue,fg341xp,t1_fg2hyou,1580469378.0,"Since you haven't noticed **I'm MtF** and plan to start HRT soon. So the whole talk about TRT etc is pointless.

I'm not taking any other medications. I'm 40 years old. The whole issue (tiredness, losing muscle, extreme stress) started approx 5 years ago."
adrenalfatigue,fe1wtut,t1_fe1suqd,1578831809.0,The fatigue started years before finasteride. I'm obviously taking it in attempt to slow hair loss.
adrenalfatigue,fcmf9j6,t1_fcmcpfy,1577773100.0,"Strange taste: OK this is a tough one. Sometimes it's kinda bitter, other times somewhat fruity. Sometimes It's worse after I exercise. I would generally describe it as a persistent unpleasant taste. I did go to my dentist and she ruled out anything teeth/ mouth related. I don't have any general stomach issues, apart from alternating between full and hungry.

edit: @timetripper11: forgot to say, it used to be metallic taste. Also all the tests for autoimmune diseases turned out negative."
depression,f82e49i,t3_dx2la6,1574189444.0,"Darn you described exactly how I feel. It's like I can't do a simple task anymore. Plus I'm trans, need to transition but the the waiting list for the therapist is too long. Literally my life has gone down the drain."
