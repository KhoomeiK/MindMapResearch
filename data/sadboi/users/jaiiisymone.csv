Makeup,fo8n2mw,t3_g6aap5,1587599802.0,"Honestly, I watched a lot of YouTube and spent hours in front of the mirror practicing. I think finding your shade and skin type are the first steps. Brows are a big thing, you can do some nice brows and feel like a new person. If you’re into lashes, a nice pair of lashes will do wonders, even without any additional makeup. Make sure you blend everything well, that’s something that is easily forgotten when you first start. You don’t want any harsh lines or for your face not to match your neck. Find a good moisturizer or primer (or both). Play around with different colors and looks, see what you like. Learn your makeup style. But most importantly, don’t forget to have fun.
Edit: and you do not have to spend lots of money to find good quality makeup!!"

And they’re so adorable it’s hard to get mad. My boyfriend and I are definitely suckers when it comes to our puppy, but she does go in the kennel when we leave. We tried letting her have the bedroom to herself when we leave, but she gets into too much and we have a good bit of electronics and more pricy shoes and that sort of thing. So we just can’t leave her out. I found that as long as she knows we can hear her, she’ll cry and make noises like she’s being murdered in the kennel and when she thinks we can’t hear anymore, she stops. And doesn’t start back. She’s perfectly fine in the kennel, she just doesn’t like it if we’re home too. Do what we did. Put the dog up, and act like you’ve left. Be very quiet and stay out of sight. Watch how quick your dog calms down. Always leave toys or something to keep the dog entertained. I also sometimes play puppy tv on the laptop for her."

That child didn’t ask to be made, you made that happen. I can’t wrap my head around this. Maybe I’m biased. Regardless, there was a better way this post  could’ve been worded.

I felt out of place there bc I’m not her kid and she just didn’t want to tell them I couldn’t stay there. I met my boyfriend in December of my senior year, so a few months before I moved with my aunt. He was literally the first person to even show me true love. And it terrified me. I was so scared that he was gonna get tired and leave me and that thought never left my head. Love is so so scary if you’ve never had it before. But we are now living together, we were expecting our first child but I miscarried. I thought he’d leave me after that, but it made us closer. My point is, when you finally find love, and yes you will find it one day, it’s gonna be the scariest thing you’ve ever felt but when you begin to let your guard down and to allow yourself to be loved it’ll be great. You just have to hold on. It will come, I promise."
