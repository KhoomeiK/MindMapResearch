Ah, then basically donating the shoes in general had almost no impact - also probably because they aren't sturdy ones that the families would have preferred. In which case, the shoes were still used so the environmental cost of producing them per use is still going to be less than not using them at all.

The link on TOMs... It's obvious they weren't going to buy new shoes within 4 months of just receiving a pair for free - maybe they're holding onto their vouchers until they really need it, for when these fall apart.

>“While all of our regression estimates lie in the direction of slightly negative impacts on household shoe purchases, they fail to reach statistical significance, and thus we cannot present conclusive evidence pointing to a negative impact on domestic markets from in-kind donations,” conclude Wydick and his co-authors.

What this means is that the estimated changes in household shoe purchases would be so low that they can't prove it would have a negative impact on the domestic shoe market. (This makes sense since I am not sure if people would spend money/use a voucher to replace a pair of shoes they got for free - only if it were within their means and it left them totally shoeless probably.) Plus, they're also only looking at the shoe market - not the overall wellbeing of the people there but we know it's not great since they wouldn't be candidates for free shoes otherwise.

We need to first look at why ""donating"" hurt the economy - in the example you shared, it's because they weren't actually donations. Those locals were effectively pumping money out of their economies by purchasing foreign goods. If those had been actual donations, they'd have been able to spend more of their money on things that were locally produced (like food, services, etc) and it might have even ultimately improved their economy overall.
Even if the excess clothes were sold, all it'd take is to sell to different populations for shorter durations so that local economies aren't disturbed. From what I read, it looked like there had been a local clothes industry that was a major part of the economy that either got completely overthrown / grew too much around foreign import.

Let's not forget, the people who are too poor to buy weren't contributing much to the economy to begin with in terms of money spent but at least they'd have shoes to wear and clothes without holes in them.

This is just regarding the article you linked - if there's something else, then let me know. BTW, needless to say, there are many places in the world that have extreme poverty - here's a list from wiki https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_percentage_of_population_living_in_poverty"

This whole post centers around OP's age and gender and although I agreed with most of your original post, I think you were wrong in that the OP is correct, his age will definitely play a role in what kind of responses he gets - just not in the way he thinks, which seems to be the older a man is, the more socially unacceptable it becomes to make remarks about beautiful, young women. You've said the frequency with which this happens is an issue but to me, it's more that it happens at all.. And what exactly actually happened.

  
He had mainly two concerns, one regarding his privacy and the other the nature of the conversation. Since the privacy aspect had been sorted, he's worried that his remarks were inappropriate because they were potentially sexist. I don't want to call him that outright because he has been careful with his words but at the same time, I don't know how to feel about people telling him that the problem was just that he was loud - he's going to think the issue is just that he's getting thrown out of restaurants for doing the same thing women do and see it as an attack against his own gender... Like I said, widening the gender division.

There's nothing hypothetical about my personal experience - in this case, one that I've never witnessed but if you've been through that, then good for you. I was never implying that it was impossible to start with so my point wasn't to strawman anything. Don't twist my words around.

My personal opinion on gender equality isn't to victimize women in the process because that's counterproductive. Men are predatorial? Well, that'd imply women are victims and that's not what I consider myself to be and I don't want other women that I disagree with speaking on my behalf. Speak for yourself.

My point is this; any sexism from either side is only going to widen the gender divide. These women are already signally to society that their shitty behaviour should be tolerated because of their gender but this just makes them obnoxious and slows down our collective effort as women. Don't try to excuse their shit - they teach male children and influence men in society on a daily basis. Choosing not to speak vulgarly in public isn't something that only one gender is capable of so don't make it.

Your mom needs to discipline your brother into a better diet - one that's more nutritional. BTW, rice and pasta are just carbs and there are a tonne of different things you could eat with those so I don't completely get what his problem is.

Lastly, if your mom is going to pay for the food, then why don't you at least just ask her to steam / fry / whatever a different veggie each day? Or include an omelet each meal? Or have some probiotic yogurt for desert?

Or forget they are human.  
For this reason, I can't tell how you're any different from a bunch of 20 yo girls talking about guys being beautiful; their hard bodies, sexy voices, etc. Also, we often don't think sexuality in itself is something bad and we talk more openly about it.  
That being said, when someone tells me that I have a great ass, etc - which I get from both men and women, I just thank them because it's meant as a compliment.

Maybe it's the tone of voice OP and his group were using because it might have made it look like they were reducing her to her looks as opposed to talking about her beauty. If the server was a female, I can understand if she didn't feel comfortable approaching the group herself and asked a man to do so. Maybe they had bad experiences with another group speaking in a similar way.  


I think the waiting staff overhearing and assuming or not caring who you were speaking about anymore means that your conversation wasn't acceptable in public in general. That they politely asked you to leave isn't really a big deal and is in their right - you could have maybe cost them other customers or made them feel uncomfortable.

\[EDIT:\]

I haven't changed my original standing, but I'm editing this text so that there's a summary of the replies I would've written to all the comments I got after locking and I've reworded things so that it's easier to understand why I've said everyone sucks here. It's not meant with ill-intent, just read.

IMHO parents are responsible for and towards their own children moreso than anyone else in society. I think OP should find someone who she feels has authority over her or he should seek out therapy for her, as one of you suggested, since it looks like the efforts of him and his wife weren't enough to socialize the girl properly.

I feel really sorry for him - he seems like such a gentle and kind person and it looks like she's taking advantage of that; she's lacking in respect, humility, shame. To top it all off, it sounds like she's more preoccupied with homecoming than the moral weight of her actions. However, this doesn't sound like something that happens overnight so I'm guessing there's been a history of her getting away with her bad attitude.

Now all that being said, I think no parent should ever try to excuse themselves of their childrens' behaviour in the sense that they had nothing to do with it - that just sounds like turning a blind eye to the actions of a person who they are responsible for. I know that kids are their own people and a lot of factors can play into how they develop so I am not blaming the parents as much as I am saying they shouldn't be saying things like, ""well, they were just born that way.""

In Europe, where I am, parents can sometimes get prosecuted for their childrens' behavior since it could be seen as neglectful upbringing. And since value for life and health are placed very highly here, people are expected to protect their own lives and health as well as that of their children and everyone else their children interact with. This means that if your children did have some inability to feel empathy and were dangerous to society, you would have to get them help if you can't help them yourselves. This might be an unpopular statement on reddit but that's how it is where I am and it makes sense to me since I don't want to see myself or anyone I care about getting hurt because of a neglected child (or for any reason or have any neglected children for that matter).

Shitty kids are the result of shitty parenting. NOT SHITTY PARENTS. This doesn't necessarily mean that the parents are to blame. But this doesn't mean that the parents aren't obliged to take responsibility either because as legal guardians they are. I've had to make this more clear since some of you misinterpreted it as blaming the parents - this is not what it is. Parenting isn't always a given, sometimes it's an acquired skill - there are books and counselors to help fine-tune these to our modern society. If it were so simple, then we'd never have bullying but that isn't the case, so I get it even though I don't have children myself. BUT if your kid is too far gone for you to handle, you should take them to a therapist or find some solution to what you're having trouble with.

Lastly, I think OP sucks for not standing up for himself and his wife even if it's against his own daughter. Since he hasn't gotten her to stop being a bully yet, I've opted for ESH.

I was just wondering whether Finnland has, let's say, a better attitude in general compared to Germany. Any native anywhere would be happy when a foreign person makes an effort to learn the language, but there's a difference in how they could react. They could either roll their eyes and lash out because their day just got harder or they can try to stay neutral if it's too much to encourage the effort with a warm smile and some extra patience."
germany,f1idbgu,t1_f1hkqyd,1569509100.0,"OP, do you feel that Finnish people treat foreigners the same way Germans treat them?

germany,f1i2zf8,t3_d9gqnr,1569505166.0,"I speak without an accent but I can't express myself as freely as I can in English (native). When most Germans finally hear that my speech isn't perfect, it seems they'd apparently been making some kind of false assumption because they are shocked when I tell them that I moved here some years ago and it's actually a foreign language I learned as an adult. Then I mostly get compliments but the damage of dealing frustratedly has already been done and it's no guarantee that they will speak more slowly, simply, or succinctly and can still get worked up if they have to repeat themselves.

I like the language and I think it's attractive when you hear a German you really like finally switch to their mother tongue but it's a whole different story if there's any kind of ""power play"" in a situation - which there almost always is. Every situation in which you'd have to ""stand up for yourself"" like at the doctor's or ""try to fit in"" like at a bar with colleagues as a German gets harder to do and keep up with as a non-native...

To me, the actual issue is the attitude. I can imagine that foreign people feel demotivated to learn if the general exchanges aren't encouraging. People elsewhere are happy with foreigners saying 3 broken words like parents cheering on a toddler speaking for the first time and those foreigners come back from that country sounding like natives after a year. It's actually more natural to me than asking someone if they are ""schwerhörig"" or shouting ""mal die Ohren putzän"" despite knowing that they're not trying to intentionally make your life harder.

Another thing, as a foreigner, yes I think it's VERY lazy to not learn the local language, without a doubt, but then again, I also think Germans and everyone else should stop comparing German to English. The English language we speak today has deteriorated really, really badly and what Germans and many natives are now fluent in (myself included) is mostly a very simplistic form. I have ""dumbed down"" my English over the many years so that it's easier for non-natives to understand and even with natives, I would have to find someone well-read or a language enthusiast to have a good level of discussion and maintain my actual skills. \[Edit:\] To give you the comparison, in the beginning, when I expressed myself in German the same way I would in English speaking with them, I was looked at like I came from a ghetto. :D

I think we should just try to kindly, politely encourage everyone to do what's best for everyone, that's all.

&#x200B;

TLDR; I think people are afraid of pissing off Germans with their semi ok language skills so they just try to opt for what's easiest for everyone - typically English. It makes them seem lazy and sometimes they actually are (which is bad) but I think it would help to be patient with them and encourage them because they're often dealing with more complex language-dependent situations which have social implications. I think it's often easier for non-natives to learn to speak basic fluent English (as opposed to, let's say, a non-English language) so I don't think it's a good comparison.
