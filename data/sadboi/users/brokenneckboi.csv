The BOS were basically trying to expand across post-war America, but the Appalachian chapter, seeing how powerful the Scorched were, effectively lost support from the Californian BOS due to Elder Maxonâ€™s vehement distaste for the use of nukes, which were one of the only means by which the Scorchbeasts could be killed.

This all caused the Appalachian chapter to lose strength over time and eventually were overrun by the Scorched.

I think that fits into game lore pretty well considering the expansionist tendencies of the BOS"
