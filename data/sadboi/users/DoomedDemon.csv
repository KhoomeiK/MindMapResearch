But this girl, she piqued my interest. She made me feel. Her voice wasn't that good to others, but it felt melodious to me. We never interacted, but I observed her and knew that she was a great person.

But, I was depressed as fuck, and I didn't want to approach her in that state. So, I worked on my mental health for over an year and a half. I changed my fashion sense. I learned to talk to girls. I went from an unattractive nerd to a normal guy. But, I was too late. She already got a boyfriend (and that son of a bitch had his eyes on two girls, including this one). It made me feel more depressed. I felt suicidal too. I regretted every action of mine. I regretted why I didn't act earlier. Why I was such a failure.

It's been 2 years now, and she's still in my uni (and my class). Everytime I see her, or see or hear her name, I can't help but cry inside. A lot of antidepressants, but still can't forget her. It's really difficult, mate. It's really difficult. She's still in my heart, and although I know and accepted that she and I can never be a ""we"", I can't seem to move on.


*BUT:*

Here's an advice for you, pal. She sure got a boyfriend, but boyfriend's not everything. She needs a friend too. If you can't have her as a girlfriend, have her as a friend instead. As you too are already acquainted, it shouldn't be that difficult for you. Talk to her as you talk to any other friend of yours. Maybe ask her for a movie (not like a date, but rather a friendly one). Or maybe go on walks together. On the other hand, if you choose to avoid/ignore her altogether, like I did, you'll end up like me. You'll see her every day, but can't talk to her. Even the mere mention of her name would bring you unbearable sorrow. DO NOT AVOID/IGNORE HER. I know that they are plenty of fish in the sea, but you wouldn't want to lose this one, pal. I repeat, If you are sure you can't have her as your love, have her as your friend instead. Be the bestest friend she'd have ever got. Just don't regret leavin' her bud.

And don't ever do shit like alcohol or drugs. They will increase your pain, and just aren't worth it.

Good Luck, friend!"

truegaming,f2vuyeq,t3_degfys,1570457722.0,"Man...They are not just a distraction, but a means of living for me. I suffer from severe depression, anxiety and loneliness. Stopped seeing my therapist 'cause she was hella biased. Stopped taking the meds (didn't get any adverse effects; guess I was lucky). And all people I know are selfish assholes. I have no friends. I'm always cast out and left out by everyone, unless it's extremely imperative for them to come to me for my aid.

The only thing that keeps me from not going batshit insane are these video games. My grades have been going down; people who see me gaming ask me to give up, but this is what keeps me alive. If not for game's, I'd be crying, cutting myself and putting myself to sleep just to avoid the pain. But these games...they keep me in check. They keep my emotions in check. Zelda, Metal Gear Solid, Metal Gear Rising, Final Fantasy, Batman (and many others that I can't recall right now)...All these games; they tell me that The Best is Yet to Come. That I need to keep moving on. That I shouldn't give up.

That's why I prefer game's with a rich story over something that's an hour long, and you replay the entire thing for months (I dislike mobile games). So yes, video games teach me a lot, and if not for them, I would have been on my Way to Fall. They are essential for my living.

The challenges that video games give. What a thrill!!! The joy that you get after you complete is what I live for.

Thank You, Video Games.

AnimalTextGifs,f0h0kpt,t3_d4kwml,1568610266.0,"The Lagrangian doesn't seem to have a velocity term. Anyway, I think this is what the dog is doing wrong:
On applying Euler-Lagrange Equation to the given Lagrangian, we get the canonical momentum to be zero (due to the absence of a velocity term), and r equates to 0 in the end. Now, here is where the pup goes wrong. He chooses the floor to be the origin and looks at the floor every time (which is the point r = 0). You need to reframe his concepts:

1. Tell him to use the Lagrangian (mv^2 ) / 2 - mgr, where v = dr/dt.

2. Take the origin to be at the point from where the treat is dropped.

Advice,eq39bzv,t1_eq340nq,1559751771.0,"Thanks a lot for taking the time and responding, mate. I may be persuaded to do otherwise, but these are my current opinions:

1. I am reluctant to go to the psychiatrist/psychologist because she didn't understand me fully, and I wasn't able to open up properly. All of it was too easy for her. She was giving me deadlines, and I always suck at them. Not being able to keep upto them made me even worse. She told me to keep record of my feelings, but thinking about everything and going all over them was too much mental pressure for me.

2. I don't really know what makes her special. But as per my observations and other people's, I got to know that she is a really good girl, and is helpful towards everyone. This, and maybe some other things that I don't remember right now are what makes me inclined towards her. And as I told, I've been isolated for so long, and the opportunities are so rare that we'd rarely meet, and even if we do, I doubt I could strike a conversation without any topic. And thanks for the video suggestion. Would look into it.

3. Sure. Uni is a great place to make friends. But that, in the early years. By the time you're in the 2nd or 3rd year of uni, groups are pretty much established. Those who've got in one get to enjoy. And those who decided to remain isolated, are doomed to be till the end. And I believe I've crossed the point where I could make any new friends/or join any clubs. With that said, there is a lot of academic pressure in my uni, and I doubt I could make any friends off uni.

But, thanks for answering, pal. Don't get many people to help me out. Thanks again, mate."
