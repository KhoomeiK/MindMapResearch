### Chapter 4:

### A Wink Gone Wrong

Jonathan lay there, prone, cheek pressed flat against the asphalt, his mouth filling with the metallic taste of pennies. As his mind re-booted, recovering from the sudden stun, he now began connecting dots, running through all the possible reasons as to why someone should want to assail him in the parking lot of a Publix -- but there were just too many recent developments to draw a reasonable conclusion.

Then Jonathan saw a woman with wildly overdone Smokey Eyes eyeshadow standing behind his assailant. ‚Äú*Oh, her,*‚Äù he thought. ‚Äú*This is all a misunderstanding.*‚Äù

And, sure enough, it was. The events leading up to present, Jonathan sucker punched in a grocery store parking lot -- his reusable shopping bag on its side, the chocolate cake he had been instructed to pickup from the Bakery skittered across the pavement in its plastic shell, the SpongeBob depicted in colorful frosting now warped and grotesquely skewed -- could be traced back to a simple, harmless, miscommunicated facial gesture.

A fact that Jonathan tried to articulate as he pushed himself off ground, ‚ÄúThis is all a misund--‚Äù But this factual basis for a resolution went unheard or unheeded as Jonathan took another blow, slumping back down to the parking lot pavement.

‚ÄúYou been sweatin‚Äô my lady,‚Äù he heard the man say as he saw work boots approach. Shit. Steel-toed.

‚ÄúCan you... just... wait a second?‚Äù Jonathan said, pushing himself up again.

Jonathan looked up at the man. Took in his burly, sunburned arms. His eyes unreadable, but intent unmistakeable, behind mirrored Oakley sunglasses. Then again at the tattered steel-toed boots. The story his appearance told was that of a guy who worked outside, a guy who worked with his hands. Meaty damn hands.

Jonathan peered around the man, looking to the woman standing behind him -- her crossed arms and expression saying: GET IT OVER WITH ALREADY. Jonathan wondered if she was not entirely pleased that her honor was being defended in this way, if her impatience hinted at an underlying feminism: *don‚Äôt use your insecurity as a justification for male violence; I am not an object to be fought over.* Or, was she just bored with the proceedings thus far -- a jealous beatdown a commonplace occurrence in their household? In either case, Jonathan could see that she would be no help in intervening.

What a tragic turn -- that all Jonathan had done to get out of his unfortunate situation since getting embroiled in this beach towel business -- that it all might be undone by an unrelated incident. By what was intended to be received as a well-meaning (and not at all sexually charged) wink.

A wink gone wrong. That wink was a timebomb. And now it was going off, right at the most inopportune time, such as it would. Knowing that this misunderstanding might interfere with Jonathan‚Äôs time-table, knowing that he had to get that SpongeBob cake to Simon, and if he missed the deadline... well, that would be not good at all. So, Jonathan knew he would have to get himself out of this mess, too. **Somehow**. Now, while Jonathan‚Äôs mind races to find a solution, let‚Äôs pause the forward progress of our narrative to fill you in on what happened --

What happened was this: The woman with the over-the-top Smokey Eyes eyeshadow was a waitress at a diner on Las Olas Boulevard, just off the boardwalk. And not the day before we met Jonathan in Chapter 1, the very day before his life was turned flip-upside-down on the beach, Jonathan dined at that diner. Sure, he chatted up the waitress -- as was his wont; we know by now that Jonathan is a loquacious and affable charmer"
