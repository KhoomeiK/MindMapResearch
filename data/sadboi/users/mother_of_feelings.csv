We are together and she stopped anger pooping."
toastme,fcord73,t3_ei4aw2,1577839494.0,You have soulful eyes. And you look like you give good hugs. Like hugs you feel in your soul.

I don't know if I am following the rules here. But you seem cool. You seem like me lol."

depression,fc3ukrp,t1_fc3tu8g,1577399014.0,"I guess the statistic itself is misleading. How times have you cleaned or handled a gun vs encountering an intruder with a gun?

In my 24 yrs shooting, countless times handling a weapon vs threatening someone with a weapon."
depression,fc3tn84,t1_fc3sxo2,1577398330.0,"True. But it makes sense. Like airplanes kill more people at once, but happen less often. So the saying is flying is safer then driving on the highway. And there are accidents every day on the highway. 

Just law of numbers."
depression,fc3sue6,t1_fc3rqvy,1577397747.0,"I think just numbers make that make sense. Encountering an intruder is much, much less likely then an accident with a loaded weapon."

It is the first xmas away from my ex and his child. We weren't married, I wasn't legally their step parent; but we were together for a while. And I've struggled with feeling insignificant in that i wasn't their parent. I've just really missed them."

I hope things go better for you."
