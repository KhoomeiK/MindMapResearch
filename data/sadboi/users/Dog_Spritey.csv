Stay friends! Don't do the same exact fault like I did!

2 Months ago my GF and the most important person in my life left me, because she wasn't sure about her feelings. It was a healthy seperation and I wanted to support her, but I can't. I was still in love with her. I said I needed my time to cope and we should go seperate ways. We deleted our numbers and pictures and we never were in contact again.
After that and an OD I barely survived, I decided to chance my life and everything went well. I dated some girls and the feelings for my ex got smaller. But I still missed her.... so I managed to get her number and decided to contact her again.

She was angry as hell. She said we promised to never contact each other and I should get out of her life. She blocked within minutes. I went crazy and wrote her on my second mobile phone. I apologized and just wanted to talk about the situation. She didn't answer and blocked me again. 
Couple days after I went again crazy and bought a number from US to contact her again. That I am hurt and just want an explanation, why she hate me so much even thou we diverge in good. She blocked me again.

Now I have to life the rest of my life with the fact, that my favourite person on earth ever, hate me the most and I go crazy. I feel so bad. 

Sorry for my venting but yeah.... don't do the exact fault like me and stay friends. Maaybe have a break for some weeks and then get in contact. I should have done the same, but now it is to late. And I hate myself for this."
BPD,fn69nsv,t1_fn648q3,1586692714.0,"Hmm to cut off important people in your life is difficult, even if they are toxic. For example, I can't cut off my ex-girlfriend, who was very abusive, toxic and cheated on me. But I am still in contact with her even thou I date another girl at this time. I think, Greg is still important for you, but try to cut him out of your life. I am really glad you take your diagnosis serious and you want ro change your life. I think you should drop your group and still be in contact with your friends who are important. Talk to them and explain, why you don't like Greg and his behaviour. Maybe they are also your opinion and support you! 

And I am really sure you will meet other people and make new connections :) You just dropped out of your school, now your life starts :D Trust me. I don't know, what you are doing now (studying or working or something else), but you will meet new people. Same was for me. 
Or try dating apps. Talk casual to some girls and make new contacts."
BPD,fn63ue2,t1_fn639bg,1586686355.0,"This is an unhealthy personality and you should really cut him off of your life. I think everyone kinda develops personalities for friends and other people, but IMO Borderliners tend to develop unhealthy personality. 
Would you say he is kind of the leader of your group?"
BPD,fn62x7b,t3_fztulu,1586685320.0,"In my opinion you shouldn't drop the whole group and stay in contact with your close friends, who are doing you good. I think it will hurt you too much to cut yourself from everyone. This Greg is a toxic person and don't deserve you. And if you can let him go, then never talk to him ever again.

I am in a similar situation and analyse every friendship of me. I also have a lot of friends. However, for each one I have a personality to be loved. And this is fucking exhausting. Maybe you also developed an exhausting personality for Greg?"
BPD,fn5t5gn,t1_fn5pmyp,1586674991.0,"I will join your club. I also fucked up my relationship with my FP. And I tried to apologize. But she blocked me on my main Handy. I apologized on my second handy and she blocked me. I fucking bought a number from US, downloaded Whatsapp again and applogized a third time and she still blocked me (she even never read my last apologize, she instantly blocked this number aswell). 
I am so sorry, what I did but she ignores me and don't want to talk to me ever again. I can't sleep and think every minute of her. I want to write a letter, but I think I am a psycho. I just want forgiveness, but I don't deserve it..... why can't I accept it and move on?"

BPD,fmw50uo,t1_fmslk1x,1586439676.0,"Thank you for advice ! I really appreciate your support. 

I dont know, if I want to get over her. I just want to be friends again, then I am happy.... but I dont understand, why she is so angry. She never was like that. She was kind, she forgave everyone but her previous best friend don't forgive him ? What did I do to her? She said, she doesn't have feeling for me, but why can't we be friends? There are so many questions and I just want answers... fuck it, if the answers hurt me. She read my other message yesterday, but she didn't answer me yet. But she didn't block me either..... I don't know what to do.

Yesterday a friend came and distracted me from her, like you said. It felt good to be loved... well, she is in love in me but I am not and I feel bad for this. 

This evening some friends will came over and we will drink a little bit. This will also distract me. 

Thank you for your support. I hope you are doing good.
I am also sorry for your break-up and hope everything will be fine.

BPD,fkao13g,t1_fkaa36o,1584014874.0,"Hmm I think it is a big case, even for men.... I am also a male with BPD and my GF/FP left me last month because of different reason (long-distance relationship, trust issues and my BPD was also a reason). But since I am part of the dating world again (new territorium), like OP it is very ""easy"" that women fall in love me. I am also not the best-looking, but it is our character traits that make us special (empathy, cheering someone up, listening, being there for someone all the time....) and some women don¬¥t experience this kindness. But I know my negative traits will fuck a possible relationship up, so I keep them on distance.

I feel really bad because of this. I make up a character for them, which they love, so I get attention. But then they want to know me better, want to give back what I gave them and I keep them on distance, even tell them they should ignore me. Yesterday this was the case and now it happened the third time in four weeks."

BPD,fj83i92,t3_fc1p7s,1583104332.0,"Oh dear,

i am really sorry for you. I know your pain, your emptiness, your instability and so on. But you are not alone. I think everyone in this subreddit just felt like you multiple times. But still we/they lived and survived. It is a hard time, but we are constantly living a hard life. Happy in one second and depressed in another second. I also felt the same. My GF/ Long time FP left me two weeks ago. I was lying in my bed crying with a razor blade in my hand and then I was crying of happiness, because I found a cigarette under my blanket and I didn¬¥t have cigarettes anymore.... :D

Don¬¥t hate your self. I think, you are beautiful person and he/she doesn¬¥t deserve you. Don¬¥t give up. You are also not alone. You have us! Also you can vent at me and message me, if you want to. I don¬¥t have anything against it :) (also I am sick and my mobile phone is dead, I am very isolated) But I don¬¥t want you to feel bad. You are an awesome person.... and I also want a cookie!"
BPD,fj81f5z,t3_fc1onq,1583102964.0,"Well, I am also ""only"" a baby Borderliner, but I still try to help you.

First of all: You are not doomed! I heard it so much, that BPD is like a little devil inside your mind and it often feels like this. However, just look it like a task of your life, not like a fate. Also, without BPD life would be boring, wouldn¬¥t it?

Sadly enough I can¬¥t give you a advice because of the emptiness. I still search for it and I am also in therapy for 2 months now and we are only discussing SKILLS and family/friends structures.... Well, SKILLS can help temporarily, but I still didn¬¥t found a cure for permanent emptiness.

My GF/ Long time FP left me also two weeks ago and it was hell on earth for me. BPD hit hard.I had also suicidal thoughts, cut myself and also I was crying of happiness, because I found a cigarette under my blanket and I had no cigarettes anymore..... It was and still is a weird time :D But it was the third time, that my FP/GF left me and I know, if I survived it the last time, I will survive it now.

Open up to your friends, who you think they can understand you and help you. Don¬¥t open up to everyone at first, only to your important friends and family member. Go to partys, get to know new people. And also do your therapy! I know it is hard time. Your GF/FP left you, but because of your ""backstory"" (manipulation and having sex with other men), you deserve someone better!

I hope I could help you somehow (I am sorry, I am only a baby borderliner and also good drunk) and I don¬¥t wanted you to feel alone. We all share the same fate and it is hard, but still we manage all to life a happy life. As I said. Life without BPD would be boring!

(Also the story of your GF who dumped you, would interest me....because it sounds at first like my first relationship, who also caused a little bit to my BPD (besides childhood traumas and so on)... You can PM me, but youd don¬¥t have to."
BPDmemes,fj7yzs2,t3_fbzmjx,1583101402.0,"I saw your post now the third time on other BPD related Reddit-pages and I am happy to hear, that you are so happy you found us. A diagnosis is often a relief, because now you have a reason, why or how you behave and have a direction.

I also felt ""happy"" as I knew I have got BPD, because I thought I was just... overreacting or something else. So I understand your happiness. However, I wish you lots of luck on your recovery. You are not alone! Stay positive.... It is an asshole illness, but look it like a task of life, not like  a fate.

I am also a Baby Borderliner. Had a fucked up childhood, but very positive. Still, childhood traumas and my general vulnerablity hit often hard. Also my Girlfriend/ long time FP left me two weeks ago. In this period of time, BPD hit hard. Lying in the bed with a razor blade in one second and then crying of happiness on the other second, because I found a cigarette under your blanket and I had no cigarettes anymore..... :D Without BPD, life would be boring, wouldnt it?"
BPD,fiva3lx,t3_f9zre2,1582756689.0,"Because we always stand up and don¬¥t give up!.... Well it was a bit to positive I am sorry. I think we are just blind and want to be loved, like we love other people: intense and emotional. But this isn¬¥t often the case, how others love in our society. 

But don¬¥t give up. I think, there is someone for everyone, even for you and me. I was in the exact same position like you. My FP of one year and me dated for 2 months and I was so happy like I was never before. I loved her alot and did everything for her (presents, compliments and so on). She also said she loved me and was a maaaaybe a little bit annoyed, because I was so romantic (she wasn¬¥t the romantic type). One day she noticed my scars around my arms and legs and I told her about my BPD and that I am in therapy. Well... one week after she left me and said she never loved me and those things like having children togheter and moving out, were just.....fun. I never understood it and never will and it was a dark time for me, with doing drugs and cutting myself. This was all one month ago.  
But hey... today I got a good grade for my exam. And next weekend I date another girl and I think it will fail. But I still try, because.... why not. I/we are ""born"" with BPD. A fate, which is exhausting. But we are still living and will live.  


Sorry for this positive vibe. I am little bit drunk and happy.  
Look forward. You really loved him and I know this feeling, but he is an asshole for lying to you. You are a wonderful woman with a beautiful fate and you will someday find someone, who will give you love. You deserve it."
BPD,fiv6jw7,t3_fa0fmq,1582754721.0,"I told my last Girlfriend/FP about BPD, when we were together for 2 months (but we were friends for one year before). Well, she found my scars around my arms and legs and asked, if I got hurt. I told her about my BPD, why I got it and why I hurt myself long time ago. She....had no clue, what BPD is and what impact it has for me. Well, she was only 18 years old (I was 20 years old) and had a very ""boring"" life (never went to a party, never drank alcohol, had only four friends and I was her first boyfriend), but was funny as hell. I still love her and miss her. She never experienced unstable-emotional breakdowns for herself and was always happy. So she was confronted with something, which she never experienced.

I tried to explain it to her, but it was very difficult. I got rarely breakdowns, when I was with her or when we were writing, but when I got one....she never noticed it or couldn¬¥t understand it. It was difficult, but I didn¬¥t need her ""help"", I just needed her to be my love.

Well, as I said to her that I go to therapy and that I am on medication, she broke up with me. It wasn¬¥t the main reason, but I didn¬¥t understand, why she left me in this miserable time and it hurts a lot. It was or it is (she broke up with me last month) hell on earth.

In my opinion, it depends on the person. If she/he is older or experienced and you notice it, then it shouldn¬¥t be a problem to tell him about BPD. But I think sooner or later, you should talk to him/her.

In my next relationship (if this ever happens again), I will be more carefully. But it is difficult with all the scars around the arms and legs."
