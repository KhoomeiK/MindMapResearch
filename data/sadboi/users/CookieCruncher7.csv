AMA,fli3ovb,t1_fli2yw8,1585174713.0,"I already told you in my previous comment! Could you not even be bothered to read it properly? So rude. Anyway, for clarification since you don’t read things properly, let me dumb it down. STRESSFUL!! This is what happens when you have 10 kids."
AMA,fli3fpl,t1_fli35fu,1585174576.0,You have awful grammar. You’re so rude. Can you not even be bothered to use correct grammar to make a good impression on a stranger? Disrespectful.
AMA,fli3aem,t1_fli2wt5,1585174497.0,"Are you saying I can’t deal with my 10 angels? I’ll have you know I have been a mother for 15 years and my children are perfectly brought up! Also, are you saying that having 10 kids is bad? Because I should be able to control how many kids I have!! That is such a patriarchal statement."
AMA,fli30sb,t1_fli2bhy,1585174350.0,"Are you suggesting I’m overweight? I don’t need multiple seats. Also, I can’t take a seat because my legs cramp. Also, I never said I hate you explicitly so you must be visually impaired."

Also, why are you, some random stranger, questioning me about my day? So weird. Also, my day was extremely stressful because my 10 kids were messing around while I was attempting to eat and work simultaneously. Being a single widow is extremely challenging! I bet you don’t even know what stress means."

AMA,fli0le6,t1_fli05kd,1585173013.0,"Urgh, why on Earth would you say that? Oreos are disgusting! They are so processed and expensive! I’m a single widow with 10 kids, I can’t afford to buy those disgusting, overpriced biscuits, if you can even call them that."

AMA,flhzjuv,t1_flhyef1,1585172455.0,"Why would you even suggest that? I would never put my darling angels up for adoption, even if I never sleep.
