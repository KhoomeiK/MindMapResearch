TransSupport,fqjo47w,t3_gizgwu,1589412731.0,"Well, it's definitely not good or standard medical practice.

Here's my experience - despite all the discrimination that does exist in the medical world, I don't think I know anyone who has actually lost access to HRT due to going to therapy. I know plenty of trans people, both in the US and elsewhere, who have been suicidal, including people who've made suicide attempts, people who've been to hospital, people who've been committed - none of them have ever had their access to HRT compromised as a result. In my past experience, my mental health delayed my access to HRT, but didn't altogether prevent it and certainly didn't revoke any treatment I was already being given.

*However,* unfortunately you can't 100% guarantee that individual medical practitioners won't decide to make that kind of decision regardless. The fear of being withheld medical treatment is not a totally ungrounded or unrealistic fear for trans people. You can't make any promises, but even if you could, he would be unlikely to believe you, especially if he already doesn't trust you.

Instead - you might not be able to convince him that there's no risk, but you might be able to convince him that there are ways to mitigate the risk, steps he can take to protect himself, and support he can access that will help him overcome any problems he might encounter. Show him that you're taking his concerns seriously and trying to take real steps to help him deal with those concerns. I don't know your area (I'm from the UK) so I can't point you towards any specific resources, but in general here are some things that might help:

* Someone who can come with him to therapy - someone close that he trusts. At least theoretically, dodgy medical practitioners tend to be more cautious if there's a witness there to hold them accountable for their choices. It can help if that person is able to make notes for them or push for them as well.
* Medical advocacy. A medical advocate is someone that can help a patient get access to treatment. They can also come with him to therapy. Look into local medical advocacy groups and/or trans self-advocacy groups.
* Any local trans or LGBTQ+ support groups, networks, etc. that might be able to give you or him some useful information. Planned Parenthood sometimes 
* See if you can find any relevant medical treatment guidelines that would support the idea of continuing to give trans people access to HRT. He could potentially print them and bring them with him to have available if the need arises. In the past I have been able to use good practice guidelines to convince doctors to give me treatment that they otherwise would not have given me.
* Find out what rights patients have in your area, especially with regards to getting a second opinion. If the rare worst case scenario occurs and a doctor decided to withhold HRT, it wouldn't rule out the option of seeing a different doctor.
* Figure out a crisis plan - people that he (or you) can call that live close to him and that can offer interventions if needed. Calling 911 carries a heavy risk of escalating the situation and arguably is more likely to make things worse than they are to make things better."

I've been considering private therapy for a while, but I've been hesitant because I feel disillusioned after having therapy on the NHS.

I've been in CBT and counselling a few times. Basically every time I've been discharged they've told me that they didn't think therapy was helping me and they didn't think it could help me any further. The reason they gave was that I wasn't fully engaging in therapy, I wasn't doing all of the tasks they set, that I wasn't managing my emotions well enough to engage properly in sessions. They said that they didn't think I would be able to benefit from therapy unless I could do those things. I was really trying my best to cooperate and do everything they said but I was struggling. It seemed like they were saying I was too mentally ill to get help for my mental illness.

I don't think that's true though, and I was wondering if maybe the real reason therapy didn't go well is because my issues were just outside of the scope of their service. The service I was using says it's meant for ""mild to moderate common mental health problems such depression and anxiety disorders"". But I'm diagnosed with autism and ADHD, and my depression and anxiety are severe.

You're experiencing loss and grief. Loss for the missed opportunities and the could-have-beens. Grief for the suffering that you've been through, that you will never get those years back.

The feeling of loss that comes from living with depression for a long time can feel a lot like losing someone close to you. You're grieving for your past self. It's incredibly difficult to come to terms with the fact that you are never going to get the chance to live those years of your life in the way that you had hoped to.

Like a lot of people do when they're grieving for a loved one, you're blaming yourself for it. You're not just saying that you feel like your life has gone to waste, you're saying that *you're* wasting it. As though you were given happiness, and discarded it.

But you can't waste what you weren't given in the first place. You didn't choose to be depressed. You weren't given years filled with happiness that you squandered. Instead, you were given years filled with depression, and yet you've been trying to do whatever you can to try to turn it into a life filled with happiness. That isn't wasting it - that's making the most if it. You're not living the life you hoped to have, but you are living the life that you do have, as best as you can.

It's true that in time, it's possible to come to accept the loss, and to recover. But that's not where you are right now, or how you're feeling right now, and it's not much comfort to be told that you may eventually feel better when the way you're feeling right now is so overwhelming that it's hard to imagine ever feeling anything else. It's natural to feel that way.

So cut yourself some slack. You aren't getting that time back, and you aren't going to feel OK about that right away, so try to go easy on yourself when you're already feeling bad enough."

You can't convince her by arguing with her or trying to justify yourself. All it can really accomplish is reinforcing her view that this is about her, that it's something she gets to have input into, and that her opinion is important and relevant.

Don't let her think that you need to prove yourself to her for her to respect you. Instead, show her that you're going to be yourself regardless of her opinion. Show her that this isn't about her. Show her that she doesn't get to choose who you are, but that what she *can* choose is whether she's going to respect you and support you regardless of her personal doubts or opinions. Don't tell her, just show her by continuing to live as yourself, and not giving her space to argue with her.

Don't give her the opportunity to input any further unless you truly want her input. If she tries, you can tell her that she's had more than enough opportunity to give her input, that you've considered it and taken it into consideration, but that it has not changed your decision, and that you aren't interested in any further input at this time.

agender,fkxrrbg,t3_fl62ap,1584634158.0,"The most popular definition of trans is ""anyone who doesn't 100% identify with the gender they were assigned at birth"". I really don't identify with the gender I was assigned at birth, so yes, I would identify myself as trans.

However it seems like you're asking something more than that - which is whether I feel like being trans is something that *defines me*, a label that I feel *attached to*, something that I really, strongly identify with.

My answer to that is a bit more difficult, but basically still yes. I don't *want* to think of being trans as central to who I am as a person. My gender (or lack of gender) is not something I'd really like to be important to my life. I spent most of my life never giving much thought to gender, just sometimes feeling frustrated or uncomfortable. I'm hoping that there will come a time in my life that I won't have to think about it much. I'm hoping that a day will come where everyone can be ""casually trans"", and there won't be any need for anyone to feel that their gender or their trans status is something that has to define them.

Still, my trans status did become an important part of my identity when I started to transition. The experiences I've had transitioning, the importance placed on gender in the culture I live in, and the support and camaraderie I've relied on from the trans community have all made a difference to my life. I spend a lot of time being very aware of this one aspect of my identity, whether I like it or not.

That's not to say that I don't want to be trans. I'm proud to be trans, and think that pride is essential to our survival. What I mean is that I think the way you feel towards the ""trans"" label is largely going to be informed by your experiences, regardless of your particular identity, whether you're a man, a woman, bigender, agender, neutrois, episcene, genderqueer, etc. I think it really works the same for any identity label, even when not talking about gender."

ftm,fkmbond,t3_fjbxdb,1584325188.0,"So I had top surgery a month ago.

I'm over 3 years on T and had reached at a point where looking like a man with noticeably large breasts was taking a heavy psychological toll on me. I'd been on a long waiting list that kept getting longer. A few months ago they told me the soonest I could expect to have top surgery was June.

So imagine my surprise when they called me up at the start of February to ask if I was available for surgery in less than two weeks. I thought I would be happy and excited. Instead I was in shock and scrambling to prepare for it both practically and emotionally. I couldn't sleep much. I honestly didn't feel good about it. It didn't feel real. I couldn't get myself to feel excited about it. I felt like I was so ungrateful. Despite having wanted my breasts gone ever since I started puberty, I was suddenly worried I would regret it. I knew that it was normal to feel worried about such a major decision, especially with such short notice. So I pressed ahead because I knew reasonably that it was the right thing for me.

After I woke up from the operation, despite being in pretty sore condition physically, I felt elated. I've never felt more relieved. I spent about a week or so feeling really happy about it even though recovery sucked. Since then I would say it's honestly maybe just felt kinda natural, almost something I would take for granted Except for little reminders, like going to the men's and realising that I don't feel like I have to hide anymore.

It's hard to believe it happened so recently because it just almost feels like it's always been this way."

ftm,fjl0qy9,t3_fdwrn6,1583437682.0,"Like other people have pointed out, the rate of detransition is much lower than it seems, and it's worth looking at the reasons why people detransition - often because they aren't safe or supported, they can't afford the costs of continuing treatment, they can't continue treatment due to medical reasons. Some/most people who cease/regret medical treatment might be counted as 'detransitioning' (depending on how it's defined) but wouldn't call themselves detransitioners, and still identify as trans. It is exceptionally rare that people who detransition say that they were mistaken about being trans, and as you say it tends to be associated with particular mental health conditions. But it's totally understandable if you don't find that absolutely reassuring if you're struggling with anxiety.

I found some articles with info about understanding/coping with ""what if"" thoughts and worrying. I hope they'll be helpful:

https://www.time-to-change.org.uk/blog/what-if-2-tiny-words-cause-me-fear-anxiety-and-depression

https://psychcentral.com/blog/5-ways-to-stop-a-worry-filled-what-if-cycle/

The way I think about it is that most people make major life decisions like choosing what to study, where to work, where to live, whether/who to marry, whether to undertake medical procedures. Transitioning is another one of those major life decisions (not saying that being trans is a choice, or that transition is 'optional', but that transitioning is a decision we make). The regret rate for transitioning is much lower than almost any other kind of life choice we make. A person is far less likely to regret transition, than, say, getting married, or having children.

However, I think what gives me the most self-assurance isn't just the statistics, but whether I think my reasons for making a decision are sound, and whether I feel like I've given reasonable consideration to the pros and cons of each option. Although there's always a chance I might regret any choice I make, I feel self-assured if I can look back on it and say that I think I made the best choice I could at the time, even if it turned out to be the wrong one. 

Plus if it turns out that I regret my decision and I figure that actually I was a cis woman all along, there are plenty of steps that I can take in order to try to mitigate and reverse the changes I've had, just as I could if I were a trans woman - e.g. laser hair removal, voice training, breast implants, etc.

Another thing to consider is that I think that a lot of fear around transition regret is based mostly on emotional bias - the idea is that not-transitioning is the baseline, the default, and that any change from that carries a huge risk of loss, whereas the default option is safer and less risky. The thing is that in actuality, neither option is the safe/default option - transitioning vs not-transitioning is an active choice either way, and both carry potential risks and rewards. Whether you choose to transition or not, you might regret it. There's no way to avoid that risk of regret. So all you can do is make the best choice you can, and feel confident that you made the choice as well as you could."

Generally each shoe company uses its own lasts (moulds the shoes are based around) so the way shoes fit differs from brand to brand, and can differ from shoe to shoe within a brand if they have a variety of shoe lasts. Most companies will have at least two lasts, one for men and one for women, but in the case of a unisex shoe manufacturer, they might either have a last based on an average of proportions across sexes, or a last based on just men.

In the past a lot of sports shoe companies designed all of their shoe fits on men, and  only introduced shoes designed specifically for women after some manufacturers noticed that a lot more women were having issues with shoe fit and sports injuries.

I'm struggling to find any info online about how unisex shoe lasts are designed. Some of the more popular unisex shoe manufacturers like Converse and Vans started out mostly being marketed towards men. So I don't know, but it wouldn't surprise if their shoe fit was originally just designed for men. Both of those companies mostly make shoes out of canvas which is pretty soft and flexible, and also have a reputation for being overall slightly narrow fit, so that might have something to do with it. Or they may also have designed their shoes around a last which is based on an average of typical men's and women's fit in order to accommodate for customers pretty evenly."

It seems like your main worries are:

1. The fear of being wrong or confused, like something bad is going to happen if you don't have a correct, accurate label for your sexuality.

2. How other people might react if you change your mind and tell them that you think you're actually straight.

3. About what all of this means about the way you view the trans men that you're attracted to if you ultimately conclude that you're straight after all.

4. The fear of change, and how quickly the way you understand your sexuality seems to be changing.

5. That your experiences don't quite match up to your expectations of what it's like to be bisexual.

Maybe the idea of being straight is a kind of safe, familiar idea to you; something you're inclined to retreat towards when you're feeling confused and worried about the idea of being bi. Whereas being bi feels like it might be liberating, but it's new, uncertain, and feels like a different set of pressures.

Perhaps a good alternative would be to think of yourself as ""questioning"", to try to open yourself to all kinds of outcomes, and to give yourself some room for freely explore your thoughts and feelings and accept them as they are. A lot of people go through a period of questioning without committing to any one particular label, refuse to use labels for their sexuality, and/or change the label they use to describe their sexuality more than once.

It sounds like you're close to some really supportive people who just want the best thing for you. I don't think you don't need to fear a negative reaction from them if you say that the label of ""bisexual"" feels like a lot of pressure and that you want to take some more time to figure things out, and that you're open to the idea that you might ultimately end up thinking of yourself as straight, bi, or something else."

Metoidoplasty is only possible if you have an enlarged clitoris. You would normally need to take T to get the kind of growth you'd need, but look into whether it's possible to get that growth just from using topical testosterone on the clitoral area.

You would still have working nerve endings with either kind of surgery, but it will not be exactly the same as a natal penis. The differences depend on what kind of surgery you get. 

From what I understand, you can have a metoidoplasty and still keep your vagina, vulva, and internal organs (and still have periods if you don't take any other measure to stop them), but phalloplasty normally necessitates a vaginectomy because it involves using the tissues of the vagina to construct the phallus."

If I were you I would take it one step at a time to start with, starting small and building momentum. Like, trying to organise and publicise one meeting in order to set your goals, decide upon what your first action is going to be, and take things from there. For example, if 
 you do it right, organising a protest can be a great way to make publicity, build community, create momentum, and raise morale.

There are some organisations in the UK which do similar work to what you're describing. If I were you I would look into those and maybe get in touch with them. They might be able to help, cooperate, offer their experience and networks, etc. 

Press for Change have been campaigning for trans rights and healthcare since 1992, and their campaign work was instrumental to trans people in the UK gaining most of the legal rights we have today, including the right to access treatment for gender dysphoria.

Action for Trans Health also campaign for trans healthcare and other trans rights issues, as well as fundraise to help trans people access treatment, and provide information to help trans people better access healthcare.

All About Trans and Trans Media Watch are two organisations which work to improve media coverage of trans people and give trans people a bigger voice in the media.

There's also Trans March which is an international group that organises trans pride marches, and they did one in London.

Those are just the ones that come to mind and some I was just able to find on Wikipedia. There are probably some that I'm missing that would be worth looking into more."

Did you mean body dysmorphia or gender dysphoria? They are two entirely different medical conditions that get confused often.

Gender dysphoria is an incongruence between assigned gender/sexual characteristics and gender identity. Body dysmorphia is an obsession with a perceived flaw in a person's body.

If you did mean body dysmorphia, did you screen for and exclude cisgender people with body dysmorphia as well?

Edit: I just saw your reply to another comment about something similar in which you say that you consider gender dysphoria to be a subcategory of body dysmorphia based on your personal experience. They can appear similar on the surface and it's possible to have both (and they might even have relatively high co-occurrence, but I don't know).

However from a medical perspective, they are categorically and functionally different, with different effective treatments.

It might be a bit like saying pernicious anemia is a subcategory of hypothyroidism, or that Lyme's disease is a subcategory of multiple sclerosis. They might look similar in some ways, and may have some co-occurrence, but categorising them as such is not accurate, and it's important to understand they are very medically different."
transgenderUK,f8mynwk,t3_e0ipsv,1574636882.0,"Transition is less of a leap and more of a staircase. You aren't going from one side to the other one big jump. You take one step, and then another, and then another.

If you're waiting to feel ready to take that first step, don't. You're never going to feel ready.

You don't need to rationalise it. You don't need to justify it. You don't need to feel comfortable, confident, or courageous.

Instead, figure out what that first step is, and then just take that step.

You are going to feel afraid. It's going to be hard to take that step when you're afraid. You might question whether you can do it. But as long as you've decided to do it, you'll eventually manage it.

Every time you take a step you're afraid to take, the process will help you with the next step.

You'll see that you made it and that you did it. Even though you were afraid, even if it took you some time, even if you had some setbacks and weren't able to do it straight away, or even if it didn't go exactly the way you hoped.

You'll see that it was worth it. You'll see that you start to feel happier than you could have imagined, more at home in your body, more like the person you want to be. The dark cloud will start to pass, and as it does, it will make it easier to keep moving up."

intuitiveeating,f75fkwe,t3_duekoz,1573414621.0,"Restricting your calories or portion sizes is a type of restriction, so yes, you are restricting.

From what I understand part, IE is based on the idea that 'food addiction' can be caused and worsened by all kinds of restriction.

The reasoning goes is that when you restrict your eating at all, your body reacts like you're in a famine. Even though you might consciously know that you're OK and that you're not really under any threat, your body can't tell the difference. So when you diet, you subconsciously feel like food is limited, and start to feel an overpowering urge to eat as much as you can when you get the chance, in case you don't get another chance. Your body is trying to build up fat reserves to help you avoid starvation when there's another famine.

This is part of why people tend to flip between dieting and then overeating, and why the majority of people who diet ultimately tend to gain weight.

The concept of IE is to break out of the cycle by reassuring your body that food scarcity isn't going to be an issue anymore, so it doesn't need to keep trying to prepare against starvation. It takes time, but the idea is that if you acclimatise yourself to being in a situation where food is abundant, your body eventually stops reacting like you're under threat. You stop feeling like you need to build up reserves, and it starts to feel more natural to just eat according to what you actually need."
intuitiveeating,f7562c6,t3_du4e3c,1573412114.0,"I relate a lot to this. I have some thoughts about it I'd like to share. 

I'm 24 as well. I developed an anxiety disorder when I was 12. I didn't understand what it was or how to cope with it. I felt that something was wrong with me. I wanted to fix it and I used the internet to try to figure out how. This introduced me to self-improvement.

My experience is that 'self-improvement' is a broad term that can mean a few things. It's a range of psychology-based, self-focused approaches to addressing all kinds of problems. It's an expression of a culture that emphasises individualism and self-reliance. It's also a multi billion dollar industry.

Like the diet industry, most of the things sold by the self-improvement industry are ineffective. Most of its customers are repeat customers. They are people who blame themselves for the ineffectiveness of the programmes. They return hoping to find the next new thing that might finally help them.

Self-improvement has a powerful appeal. It offers simple solutions and makes you feel like you're in control of your life. But what if your problems aren't something you can actually fix all by yourself? What if the reason you can't solve them isn't because you're lazy or because you haven't read the right book?

In a culture of self-responsibility and individualism, there are only two options: Self-improvement or no improvement. So when you start to think that self-improvement doesn't work, it means giving in to irresponsibility or despair. There's no room for a third option: Social improvement. There's no consideration for solutions that mean people have to work together, or rely on each other for help, or change things together."

ftmfashionadv,f5f3wqd,t3_dncuhq,1572178016.0,"Yeah I definitely feel this. Before HRT I felt like I was too fat even though I was actually pretty thin because I have  a very 'feminine' shape, wide hips and a large chest. I wore baggy stuff to hide my body shape but it didn't really work. I think it's better to try to wear things that are better fitted if possible.

For me this is what works, but it will be different depending on your body shape:

Baggy or straight-legged trousers are popular and a lot of guys say they look more masculine in them, but generally for me they don't really help me look more masculine and just kinda make me look a bit swamped. I find they are usually a close fit around the thighs but baggy around the calves, which just draws more attention to my thighs and emphasises them in my opinion. They also tend to make my feet look small.

I tend to find that skinny jeans often fit me more like slim jeans, and that slim jeans are the best look for me. A slim fit looks like an even fit along the whole leg which means my leg looks more in proportion. It also helps make my feet look longer.

I actually often wear women's jeans because for me they're more comfortable for me (more stretchy). They normally only have tiny pockets so I sew bigger pockets into them. A lot of trans guys do find that men's jeans are more comfortable and that the extra crotch space translates well into extra hip space (or space for a packer if you want). Finding jeans that fit well goes further for looking masculine than whether they're technically from the men's section or not, since men's jeans and women's jeans look pretty much the same anyway.

I wear button-up shirts pretty much every single day. They tend to look masculine, flattering, and good for covering up a binder. The key (and the hard part) for me is getting a good fit around the shoulders, abdomen, and sleeves. Especially pre-T I'd often find that if a shirt wasn't too tight around the abdomen, it would be baggy in the sleeves and shoulders, which would make my wrists and shoulders look small. I sometimes resewed the buttons on the sleeves to make them fit closer around my wrists. After T and going to the gym I started being able to fill out the shoulders of shirts more easily but until then it was generally a case of trying on a lot of shirts until I found something that fit.

Also I try to layer when I can. If I wear a shirt, a coat, and a scarf, my chest pretty much disappears even when I'm not wearing a binder. I'm really glad it's autumn and I can start wearing layers again!

I think really the key is to just experiment and find menswear that fits and flatters your body shape. Getting a fit that suits your body instead of hiding it makes a more masculine look than trying to swamp yourself with big clothes.

Most importantly wear clothes you feel comfortable and at home wearing. Confidence does more for passing than any fashion detail.

MensLib,f4zrye7,t3_dbd6r8,1571914642.0,"Trans people in general elicit disgust from people who can't tolerate difference, but trans women especially seem to be viewed with particular disgust, which makes them fascinating to transphobes.

It seems like it's because the idea of willingly giving up manhood is unthinkable within a worldview that says your genitals determine your gender and that men are superior. It's difficult to reconcile the existence of trans women with such a worldview. The most common way is to try to ascribe some sort of perverse, underhanded motivation to it. This generates a great deal of fascination and sensationalism, and excites all kinds of imagined outrage and fetishisation.

Whereas it's easier for trans men to be understood within this worldview as being women attempting to attain a greater social status. This is still an interesting and transgressive enough concept that there are various popular folk stories about women posing as men for the sake of going on adventures, but they aren't viewed as much of a threat. Without that element of threat, trans men don't generate the same level of excitement and outrage as the imagined threat of trans women.

So pretty much my thinking is that trans men are relatively invisible because transphobes just don't have very strong feelings about us, and we're relatively easily forgotten about and ignored."
MensLib,f4zn75r,t3_dm4reh,1571911455.0,"In sex ed at school I was taught that condoms could accommodate for any size penis. They even did a demonstration where they stretched a condom on over their fist to prove that nobody was too big to wear a condom. But of course they didn't talk about the issues of overstretching a condom like that in practice, nor the problems of wearing a condom that was too large.

Because I'd been taught misinformation it took way too long to realise the reason I kept having issues with condoms during sex was that my partner's penis was too wide to fit a regular condom and that the constriction would cut off the blood flow and ruin the erection, or that it was being overstretched and broke from the friction.

We also had other issues that could have been avoided with good sex ed, such as if we'd been taught that you should consider using lube to reduce friction and avoid tearing even if you don't have particular issues with dryness.

I'd really believed that I'd had a comprehensive sex education because I had a lot of sex ed classes, probably at least one class a year at school from age 9 onwards.

* If you feel fatigued, depressed, weak, etc. get some blood tests if you can. A lot of doctors direct you straight to antidepressants and therapy when there's a good chance there's a vitamin deficiency or another common health issue like hypothyroidism.
* Depending on where you live and what you eat, consider taking vitamin D supplements, especially in Winter. Like lately I've been seeing posters at my local pharmacy saying most British people should be taking vitamin D supplements. Alternatively you can try to eat a lot more vitamin D rich foods but it's easier for most people to use supplements and they do help.
* If you tend to eat 'junk food' snacks like crisps and chocolate, try to eat something else along with it with more fibre and complex sugars, like fruit or veg. Also have a glass of water with it. It will help avoid the spike/crash in your blood sugar, insulin, etc., reduce the urge for a second helping, give you that extra nutrition, and get you more into the habit of eating healthier snacks. The water will also help you with the dehydration caused by the salt and sugar.

asktransgender,f33e1ux,t3_dff0yy,1570636852.0,"A couple thoughts:

1. Have you seen many positive examples of gay male relationships to help you visualise what it might look like to feel and behave masculine around a guy that you're in a relationship with? I think that a lot of the time in relationships people end up (unconsciously) imitating the behaviour they've observed in the relationships that they see around them, in their families, their friends, the media, etc. And for most of us most of what we see are straight relationships and we reproduce those dynamics in our own relationships. I think it's why some of the gay people I know have said that they struggled to figure out how to start a relationship and make it work, because they didn't know what a gay relationship was supposed to look like, they didn't have rolemodels for gay relationships, they were just figuring things out as they went along.

2. Maybe your behaviour isn't necessarily all that feminine, it's just how you act around the person you love when you're being affectionate and vulnerable? A lot of cis guys in straight relationships act in ways that might be seen as more stereotypically feminine when they let their guard down and act in a way that feels natural around someone they love. They soften and pitch up their voices, they enjoy being the little spoon, they feel all gooey when they think about romance. Men are taught to repress these feelings and behaviours, but it doesn't mean that they aren't there."

I've only been living openly as male for a few years but I feel like the only useful things I've learned late about being a man are how to ask for a haircut at a barber, how to shave/trim/groom facial hair, how to buy menswear that suits me, and how to sing in tune after my voice dropped.

I can answer any questions about those things if you'd like but for the most part these things were not that hard to learn from Google and a lot of cis dudes seem to get by just fine without half of those skills.

Meanwhile I talk to a lot of cis men who seem to say that they feel what they learned in their teens about being men was mostly how to feel ashamed of themselves, how to hide their shame, and a lot of misconceptions about women, relationships, and emotions. Much as I wish that I'd had the chance to be an adolescent boy, sometimes it sounds like I didn't miss out on much.

Autistic,f2xevlc,t3_dedaut,1570477602.0,"From what you've described I think it sounds as though it might be likely and that it would be worth pursuing a diagnosis. I don't think that it sounds like a stretch. Many autistic people are able to blend in and seem 'normal' to other people, especially because a lot of people don't really understand what it means to be autistic.

Something to keep in mind is that there are some similarities between Tourette's and autism, which can make it harder to get a diagnosis of autism when you already have a diagnosis of Tourette's. A friend of mine with Tourette's even said that some doctors believe that you can't have both autism and Tourette's. However I've also heard that a lot of people do have diagnoses of both autism and Tourette's.

I first learned about autism when I was about your age. I asked my dad whether he thought I might be autistic and he said no, and joked that I was too disorganised to be autistic (because he had a misconception that autistic people were all very organised). I also asked my psychologist and she immediately said no and changed the subject. So I gave up and assumed I wasn't autistic until I was 21 and I met a lot of other autistic people and started thinking about it again. I decided to be persistent until I got a referral to an autism service, where I met a psychiatrist who specialises in diagnosing autism. They carried out an assessment and diagnosed me with autism.

My advice is that if your parents and/or your doctors aren't initially cooperative and seem to dismiss you or not take you seriously, be prepared to be insistent. It might be a good idea, if you can, to find out what the protocol is for diagnosing autism in your area so that you know what to expect. The process is different depending on where you live.

Where I live in the UK, the process for a teenager or a young adult is that your doctor asks you a few questions, and then refers you for an assessment with a service that specialises in autism. The assessment itself mostly involves filling out questionnaires and talking to a psychiatrist (who has a lot of experience with autism)."

MensLib,f2je0ul,t3_dd7xct,1570271191.0,"I don't remember her that well but from what I recall when my mother was still alive she was a bit strict but otherwise an attentive, loving parent. I lost her when I was eleven and it left me with a lot of mental health issues that affected almost every part of my life. It's difficult to tell what impact it has on my relationships, but mostly that I ask for a lot of emotional support to deal with my depression and anxiety.

My father was loving and patient in the wake of her passing but after a couple of years became strict and controlling. He deals with anxiety by trying to take control of a situation, and it was an anxious time for my family. Now as an adult I also find myself feeling the same way and wanting to take control when I feel anxious.

I am very careful not to let it affect my relationships. I told my partner I feel like I have a controlling tendency when I'm anxious and she doesn't feel that I am at all controlling, which was reassuring. I make sure to ask consent before I take charge of an anxious situation. I back off if I think I might be starting to make her uncomfortable by getting overly involved. I make a conscious effort to leave well alone if I think that I'm asking too much or she's not ready.

For example, I could tell my partner was struggling with undiagnosed ADHD, and it made me anxious to see her struggling so much in a way I felt could easily be addressed. A part of me wanted to just make a doctor's appointment for her and push her to come to it. But she wasn't ready for it, so instead I tried to encourage her by talking about how much it could help without being too insistent, I offered to help book the appointment if she needed it, and offered to support her by coming to the appointment with her. It took her a couple of years but she did eventually feel ready to do it herself. I was there to support her, but ultimately it was her own decision, and she spoke for herself with only a little input from me."

First you said that the people you mean would surely agree with you, and now you're saying that they can't make choices for themselves. Why do you keep shifting the goalposts?

It's like the textbook definition of eugenics. You pretty much said the quality of the gene pool is declining because we're letting disabled people live long enough to reproduce. You want to improve the genetic quality of the population by eradicating autistic people. You think of autism as a kind of genetic defect to be removed.

I don't want a cure for my autism. I think of it as a part of normal human genetic variation, not a disease. I think that the world would be a much worse place without autistic people in it. Autism is a part of who I am, in some ways it's a gift, and I don't want to change it.

Most of the problems I have as an autistic person are problems I have because people don't accept or accommodate for my differences in the way that non-autistic people are accepted and accommodated. I have a different set of strengths and weaknesses to neurotypical people, and they aren't widely understood or accepted, and the lack of acceptance sometimes makes my life harder, but I don't think that the solution to that is to try to make me more like other people. I want other people to accept and understand me for who I am, not try to change me to make me more like them."
autism,f0oxi3q,t3_d5othz,1568822492.0,"I think Sheldon as a portrayal of autism has a lot of issues, but I feel like this post goes about addressing those issues in totally the wrong way.

Sheldon is generally regarded by autistic people as a bad portrayal of autism because his behaviour is a kind of two-dimensional, cartoonish stereotype of autism that reinforces damaging cultural myths about autism.

But this person is saying he's a bad portrayal because he doesn't lash out, have public meltdowns, or get socially ostracised, and therefore he's not a real autistic person. This is just gatekeeping, and medical ignorance. You don't need to do any of these things to be diagnosed as autistic and many autistic people don't. My autism isn't loud, explosive, and offensive. It's quiet, sensitive, and withdrawn. I've generally had friends for most of my life and my social mishaps have never gotten me into extreme trouble. I've had plenty of other kinds of issues, but according to this person I have ""cute autism"" and not real autism.

The character of Julia on Sesame Street has generally been praised by autistic people and the parents of autistic children for being relatively accurate, making autistic children feel represented (especially autistic girls, who tend to be underrepresented in media), and helping non-autistic children to better understand and include their autistic peers. I don't see any need to criticise her portrayal on the basis that her autism doesn't resemble their son's autism. Every autistic person is different."

asktransgender,eytoft5,t3_cymszi,1567441748.0,"Coming out works differently for everyone. My egg cracked when I read a post from someone talking about how they had just figured out that they were trans. For years I had been repressing the idea and I just suddenly reached a tipping point where it all came out at once and I couldn't stop thinking about it and trying to figure out what I wanted. I thought about it obsessively for a few weeks but didn't want to talk to my then-partner about it until I was sure I knew what I was doing. Then I suddenly just kind of dumped it all out very quickly on him. From his point of view he had no idea I was questioning my gender identity, and then suddenly I told him I wanted to change my name and pronouns. He did accept it but it took him time to try to come to terms with, which is totally understandable.

It's not exactly the same situation, but I feel like her behaviour sounds a lot like mine was when I first came out, so I find it totally believable that she really would be trans. Being around you might have caused her to see something in herself. She might have stayed quiet about it because she didn't feel ready to talk about it until she was more sure of what she wanted. I also think it's really unlikely that any cis man would actually transition just in order to date someone. It just seems like the most simple explanation is that she really is transgender and that she's just managed to process it really quickly. Of course I don't know her, and you do, and maybe there's something I'm missing here, I don't know.

My guess is that you're wary because your brain is trying to protect you after your history of trauma. You've been manipulated and abused in the past, so you're on high alert in your relationships looking for any sign of danger. Be gentle with yourself; it's only natural for you to be suspicious and be trying to protect yourself after everything you've been through. It's OK if you need some reassurance.

You need to have a serious discussion about this with her. Don't make accusations, just talk to her about her thought process, try to understand what's been going on in her head recently, and how she came to this conclusion. Maybe, if she seems like she's secure enough and ready to talk about it, it might even be a good idea to gently explain your anxiety and ask for her reassurance that she's thought things through."

I know two people who have DID who do consider themselves to be transgender, so it is possible to have both, but it sounds like you have conflicting feelings about it, and that you're not really sure whether you're transgender or whether only Daniel is.

[This page](https://www.mind.org.uk/information-support/types-of-mental-health-problems/dissociation-and-dissociative-disorders/treatments/) has some good information about seeking diagnosis and treatment for DID.

It might also be a good idea to ask your GP for a referral to a Gender Identity Clinic, and any local services that might offer counselling or therapy for people with gender identity issues.

I'd recommend looking for other people with DID to talk to about this issue as well because they might be able to help support you. Maybe try looking for a Facebook group or a forum for people with DID."
aspergers,ey86p13,t1_ey7m66k,1566912747.0,"There are apparently [some physical characteristics that are more common in autistic people](https://www.kevinmd.com/blog/2010/07/physical-features-autism-spectrum-disorder-asd.html) but there hasn't been a whole lot of research on it. There's nothing here about noses but maybe that's something you saw in a different study.

The more visible differences I've noticed (in many autistic people, but certainly not all) aren't to do with physical characteristics, but more to do with gait, facial expression, grooming, and dress sense. I've also heard people say that autistic people tend to look young for their age, and in my experience this is often true, and can be a blessing or a curse.

When autistic people do look different, it tends to be memorable, so I imagine that the more memorable examples of autistic people who look different tend to stick in people's minds as their image of what an autistic person looks like, and means they tend to overlook the many autistic people who don't look especially unusual in any way.

When I was seeking my diagnosis I was told by a mental health professional that I didn't look autistic because I had a 'spark' in my eyes and all the autistic people he'd met apparently had 'lifeless eyes'. Interestingly, part of my diagnosis was that I have an unusually highly expressive face, so something that one person mistook for a sign that I'm *not* autistic actually turned out to be a sign that I *am* autistic."

Since we're talking about binding safely, one thing I wish more people knew is that using an actual binder carries these risks too, albeit these risks are greatly reduced compared to using ace bandages. Even if you follow the safety guideline of not wearing your binder for more than eight hours per day, the risks are still there. The guideline reduces the risks, but it doesn't remove them altogether. If you wear a binder for eight hours a day every day for a few years, it adds up.

I've heard that Spectrum recently redesigned their binders to apply pressure at the back rather than the ribcage. It's definitely more comfortable IMO and I'd be interested to know whether this further reduces the risk of damaging the ribcage."
