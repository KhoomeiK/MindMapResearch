C'est aussi vrai que pour trouver la motivation √† √©tudier , c'est parfois tr√®s dur, mais tu as d√©j√† fait 3ans , c'est d√©j√† √©norme bien jou√© !! Continue √† travailler dur, tout cel√† paiera , aucune honte √† ne pas avoir √† de job non plus , tu es un √©tudiant alors concilier les deux c'est quasiment impossible sans les vacances, tu fais d√©j√† beaucoup ! Si tu as besoin de parler √† quelqu'un n'h√©site pas √† me mp, bon courage poto ‚ù§Ô∏è"

selfharm,fbbt92c,t3_ecilqr,1576707626.0,"Hello, being scared of it is normal, cutting deep can be really dangerous. Feeling the pain help sometimes , but maybe you should find something different to ""relax"" ? I am nobody to tell you this , but try to stop again , even if that's very difficult,I know it... Bad times are just bad times , I wish you the best , I know you can be strong enough to get better. Love <3"
SuicideWatch,fb5x1i0,t3_ebjyw1,1576536011.0,"Hello kerouacaurus, I think that's bold to come here and speak about your life to strangers . You said you are weak , but I think you aren't , you are strong enough to talk about painfull things , you lived for almost 27 years , and a part of your life seemed very happy. There bad times , maybe they are very rough for you but things can get way better, I won't change you, i can't , my english is pretty bad and it's hard to support someone throught just words. Words can't describe how i'ts hard to live when everything is bad , and also , words can't describe how much I want you to live. I am a complete stranger and I want the best for you , I had very bad times too and that was very difficult. I think that the message you posted here was the first step of recovery. I am nothing but a stranger , but I truly want you to be happy, you did the first step , just keep going. Love"
