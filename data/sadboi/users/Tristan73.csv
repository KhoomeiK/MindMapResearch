Homeplate,fmhqsnl,t3_fvag76,1586090689.0,"Start with driving off your back foot more, almost like you’re trying to leap forward. It’ll help give you a few more MPH

Also, land a little more open, that way you can be more balanced as you land and more ready to field or react. You want to end up more squared up to home plate

One more thing, point your glove hand at the catcher as you are coming forward in your windup, it’ll help with accuracy and give you more torque, that way you can have more power as you pull your glove in and come down. It’s almost like you’re actively trying to pull your glove hand back down from there. Again, more torque = more power."
