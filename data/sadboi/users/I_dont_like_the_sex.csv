I also wondered for so long how a person could tell you they loved you and still be so mean, indifferent and cruel towards you. 

He doesn‚Äôt love you. You called him out on his bullshit, and set straight boundaries. He‚Äôs punishing you. In my case, he knew what a torture it was for me to lose a friend. So he punished me. 

You know you deserve more. I‚Äôm so proud of you for realizing what he was doing and stopping him. It‚Äôs gonna hurt like shit and it‚Äôll be hell, but know that you are doing the right thing. You are capable of beautiful amazing emotions and sensitivity that he isn‚Äôt. If he ever chooses to heal that, great! But for now, he‚Äôs a horrible, manipulative empty being. Please, I advice you not to contact him. I also felt like I wanted to contact him for his birthday. But the hard truth is that he doesn‚Äôt care. 

Do not deplete yourself trying so hard to show someone else your decency. He knows you are, that‚Äôs why he targeted you in the first place. And even if he didn‚Äôt, you can try as much as you can to show someone what‚Äôs in front of them, but if they don‚Äôt want to see it, they never will."
NarcissisticAbuse,fiwe549,t1_fiv4oxd,1582782676.0,"That couple is freaking trash (or clouded by him), and you don‚Äôt need that shit in your life. After my experience with a narcissist I disappeared. I deleted social media and didn‚Äôt contact anyone. I was too depleted to do so. I even questioned my love for these people, because after him, I felt nothing but sadness, confusion and anger. I felt like the worst person ever. But one certain thing happened, and it‚Äôs that the people who truly love me, want me and missed me searched for me. No favors asked, just the genuine need to spend time with me. It took a lot of time for me to feel something again, but they were patient with giving me my space and their full support. If anything, this horrible experience made me realize these amazing people are the family I got to choose. Sometimes I think they chose me.

Ditch those pieces of shit. I‚Äôm so sorry these people have treated you like an option and an object. You are SO MUCH MORE than that!

It‚Äôs okay to have conflicting feelings about him. I missed him so much when the separation was fresh. Then I only missed the affection he occasionally gave, not really him. When I came to terms of him using and abusing me, I stopped missing him. He didn‚Äôt deserve it, but still there were conflicting feelings, memories. I wasn‚Äôt grounded at all. You WILL heal, but have patience with yourself, it takes an excruciatingly long time. I truly hope you find your soul family, or they find you. A good thing of these processes is that you learn people‚Äôs true colors, who is really there for you and who isn‚Äôt. 

You have here a group of people who want you to heal, who want you well. And I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôre more than happy to chat with you when you‚Äôre having a tough moment and need someone to vent to. More building up and less of destroying each other. Sending much love to you!üíï"

So long as the people who are participating are consenting to this, you‚Äôre all good. Having a dark humor isn‚Äôt a bad thing, so long as no one is being hurt.

T H I S ! I used to beat myself over it, but going back to myself I realized, it‚Äôs who I am. I see the light, the hidden potential even in the most rotten of seeds. We all have darkness and light, it‚Äôs what we feed that grows. He chose to feed his inner monster; I chose to feed my light. 

I lost my self worth after him, but someone reminded me that it is my light that attracted that moth. Some people don‚Äôt seek exchange, some seek to consume, steal, eat, take. You are an amazing light source for seeing the very hidden beauty through the thick layers of rot. It‚Äôs funny how great light seems to attract darkness like a magnet."
AskMen,fiohsl0,t1_fin9ykh,1582583613.0,"My dad and I have had the scare each other game since I was young. We‚Äôve had spooky experiences before, and his reactions are always punching whatever it is that grabs him. I started doing the same when I felt something jump on me one night. Anyway, knowing that, I would scare him in ways he wouldn‚Äôt be able to reach me with a punch. 

For example. One night he was getting ready to take a bath. On the house that we lived in then, his room and bathroom were in the basement. So, as silently as the squeaky stairs allowed me, I walked down and hid at the entrance of the bathroom below the light switch (almost kneeling so he wouldn‚Äôt reach my face). I waited patiently for a few minutes while he got his shit. I hear him getting closer until he flicks the light on and I screamed. Surprisingly he didn‚Äôt punch, he jumped back and I think I almost gave him a heart attack. WORTH IT. He just stared at me, pointing at me like, ‚Äúgood one‚Äù. After he caught his breath he said, ‚Äúthat was a really good one, but don‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôm gonna get you back.‚Äù 

Other times I‚Äôd just hide in corners and grab his feet or wait until he was sitting down in chairs that were hard to reach back. 

The real lesson here is: If you know they throw punches, learn to evolve it without being in their way, grasshoppers."

Dissociation,fin8qy9,t1_fiklz6b,1582558376.0,"Just like a beautiful mosaic :) We are all shattered pieces at first, chaotic and scattered when dissociation activates. Slowly we put the pieces together, from the very core out, disposing of the fragments we don‚Äôt want. Each little piece is unique and separate, just like I feel when all my traits split, but together they make one whole. ‚ÄúNothing and everything; One and many, at the same time.‚Äù You just explained it almost exactly as I when I created my first mosaic at a time of dissociation. It‚Äôs why I love it so much. And yes, you are extremely powerful for going through that and mastering it. Mastering yourself is one of the most difficult things you‚Äôll go through. But it is true power. And I agree, it comes with a lot of pain, but a sense of pride. 

‚ÄúKnowing others is intelligence; knowing yourself is true wisdom. Mastering others is strength; mastering yourself is true power.‚Äù

-Lao Tzu


‚ÄúBut the worst enemy you can meet will always be yourself; you lie in wait for yourself in caverns and forests. Lonely one, you are going the way to yourself! And your way goes past yourself, and past your seven devils! You will be a heretic to yourself and witch and soothsayer and fool and doubter and unholy one and villain. You must be ready to burn yourself in your own flame: how could you become new, if you had not first become ashes?‚Äù

-Friedrich Nietzsche

P.S.
I‚Äôm sorry you had to go through those things. Not being in control of our bodies is a very scary thing. Regarding your mom, I don‚Äôt even feel qualified to say anything about it. Loss is heavy, and we all deal with it in our own way. There‚Äôs no rule book for that. We never completely get over the loss of someone so close, but it becomes light enough for us to accept it and move on. I‚Äôll give you a little something from my spiritual experience and perspective: She is energy, and someday your souls will reunite. That little weight that does not hurt, but feels like love every time you think of her, is your bond and her presence in you. It sounds clich√© but that‚Äôs how she remains with you. Sending a BIG hug to you!"

Dissociation,fik3z19,t1_fijwim2,1582472193.0,"Oh, shut up I hate that x( ! I don‚Äôt know if you can relate, but when things get real bad I feel like my eyes are windows and I‚Äôm looking out of windows, and this body feels like just a vessel. I move my hands and it feels so alien, like I‚Äôm controlling a machine. 

In other cases I‚Äôve felt like I expand, like I‚Äôm more of a space than solid matter. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm explaining myself well. It feels scary and overwhelming, but I‚Äôm taking the experience and exploring it rather than trying to suppress it. I split and start feeling like I‚Äôm everything and nothing at the same time. I really think we have these lapses of derealization because we kinda go back to our deeper knowledge and reality. This is like slumber, a spec of reality compared to how big we are. It‚Äôs incomprehensible all at once because of the veil, and what we‚Äôve been fed since we‚Äôre born. I‚Äôd suggest you to explore it. Dive in to your darkest unexplored depths. Go through the process however uncomfortable it is. Do it at your own pace. Step back whenever it gets too overwhelming, and get a good support system for you to share the experience and ground yourself. I think you‚Äôre a vast amazing being for withstanding all of it. You are more powerful than you know."

Dissociation,fii5w3m,t3_f7v3nd,1582417765.0,"I don‚Äôt see them as disorders at all. Before you can get to a certain type of order, there must first be chaos. We are medicated and advised by professionals to repress these symptoms. In my journey through a few of these ‚Äúdisorders‚Äù I‚Äôve found, that it is only having gone through that that I‚Äôve found my higher and powerful self. 

I used to think that I was weak for getting panic attacks over ‚Äúsilly‚Äù things. Now I know that I am a sensitive being and I can tune in to subtle energies that not many comprehend yet; invisible and intangible things that I can tap into and affect my mind, body and soul. 

Dissociation is an incredible introspection tool that breaks you into a billion pieces, and you feel like shit. You find yourself swimming in your darkest, unexplored depths, and come into a higher understanding as you slowly float back to the surface.

I think these are evolutionary symptoms, of waking up, of having come down here from a higher plane to a dense world, of the beginning of the superhuman... Not everyone‚Äôs reality is the same. Point is, if we stopped seeing them as disorders and started understanding from the root, and working *with* them, the journey and results would be much lighter and richer."
