Put it this way, I could watch his KC videos on auto play for ages, I could watch his CC vids 5 times over, these were good unique video concepts that no one else really did well. If he wanted to keep his channel successful, he should’ve kept going what brought people to his channel, and adapted on those concepts.

Personally I found the whole “simp” thing boring drama as well. The joke may have been funny for the first week but after that the fact people still fucking say it for months on end really shows the kind of dumbfuck fans that actively follow Idubbbz. 

I can see his channel slowly dying out to be honest, but if that’s what he wants or if he’s not invested in the channel anymore, then that’s fine. More power to him."
