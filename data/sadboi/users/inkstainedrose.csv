The Dr had given him 2, a mild one he was supposed to take frequently (like Tylenol) and a stronger one for emergency (which commonly causes n* or v* I believe) he was only supposed to take the stronger one if the pain was very bad but instead he mixed them up and took the strong one frequently and on an empty stomach. He ended up v*ing on the second or third day. After that his mom realized he was taking the wrong meds and wasn't eating so she was on top of him after that and he was fine.
