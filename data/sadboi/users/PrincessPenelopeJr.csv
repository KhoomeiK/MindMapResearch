Was visiting Geysirs (boiling water from the earth, over 200 degrees F) in Iceland, and there was a foreign family with two young children (about ages 3 and 5). The youngest girl kept running ahead of her family, and her parents/other sibling ended up not following her fast enough. They were indeed busy photographing a different Geysir, and didn’t seem concerned about watching her too closely —- which I immediately took note of as a red flag. And yes, internally judged their parenting also. 

It was just my husband, myself, and this little girl by a huge hole of boiling water in the earth. Sure enough, the little girl lost her balance and almost fell in — BUT I CAUGHT HER. I saved her life. Because that’s what you do. It’s human decency."
