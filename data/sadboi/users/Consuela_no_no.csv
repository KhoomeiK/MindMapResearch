Agreed, it’s crazy to automatically label someone as an anti, as not being a fan, just because they* see the artist as a human being, one that can make mistakes.

Personally my Twitter line is pretty free of this stuff because I’ve muted and blocked some accounts, that way everyone gets to have their own twitter* experience.

One thing people also forget, is that a lot of nsfw content, in all its forms, comes from and is consumed by younger people, who are using this as an outlet to explore and develop, so having blanket bans or reporting them for no reason, apart from your personal dislike, is not only a shitty thing to do but is also curbing their development.

You know it’s pretty obvious that you actually don’t respect him and the group, let alone love him or the group as a fan, when you have to put up a fake disclaimer before you proceed with your comment.

This is the equivalent of, “I’m not racist / bigoted, I have xyz friends ”, when the truth is always, yes you’re racist / bigoted and in this case, you are not a ot7 fan, I’d hesitate to even call you a fan of any of them. 

> He is undoubtedly a big part of the bond between members...maybe their trajectory would be different if he hand them there all along.

Ah yes, the classic backhanded acknowledgement of Seokjin’s existence, where grudgingly ot6 will admit his significance, whilst reducing him to just “emotional support”. Always trying to take away from him as a working member of the group.

> he has good vocals once in a while...he could easily be replaced by maknae lime

So this is how you express your alleged love for him? This is your definition of ot7?
Belittling his skills and claiming he is replaceable by the rest of the vocal line?

> his voice isn’t particular in any way...he doesn’t have a signature sound.

???? Seokjin has a very distinct voice, it may not be everyone’s favourite but it’s one of the first ones people new to the group recognise. Why? Because there is no mistaking Seokjin with anyone else when he sings, his voice is clear, light pleasant, warm, it is distinctly Seokjin. Even when he first started and hadn’t developed his skill as strongly as today, every word, every line he sung, had his signature. 

> having a ballad voice doesn’t count

I’m not one to reduce Seokjin to ballads, he’s clearly shown over the last 7 years that he can execute any style given to him, I am unsure of this vitriol towards ballads. The top singers in the world are ballad singers, the maknae members you have chosen to point out specifically, Jungkook and Jimin, also have voices suited towards ballads. Using that as a method to try to insult Seokjin, is a poor and ill thought out attempt, one with which you’re also insulting the members you clearly favour.

> oh, then Jimin could be replaced by Jk

Well no, no one would say that because actual fans and people who actually listen to music and aren’t simply mindless maknae line stans, are well aware that no one in BTS, let alone the vocal line, is replaceable. Each member brings something different to the table and are the pieces that make BTS BTS. 

> line distribution 

This means nothing, doesn’t matter is it’s a word, background vocals, solos etc, when it comes to his contribution to the discography, if you take him out of every song BTS has ever put, you instantly lose the incredible warmth his voice brings to songs, they would be lacking.

> you can see that he struggles and feels uncomfortable 

So you can see things that others can’t and are also apparently in touch with his feelings? Seokjin has executed choreography as an idol with precision and passion, from the start until now, it’s about time people stop pretending he has ever lacked in his work.

> I rally for his removal....think BTS would be better from now on if he wasn’t a part of the group 

For someone who allegedly does not feel that way, you sure have an easy time being malicious and disrespectful about him.

> before debut, if they had to choose the irreplaceable members Jin wouldn’t have made the cut

I’m not sure whether I should I laugh at this comment or cry at the lack of comprehension and hate this comment shows. 

Do you really think, BigHit decided to invest millions and take a risk on members they already didn’t think were “irreplaceable”.

Do you really think that your personal obsession with Jimin and Jungkook gives you more knowledge and authority to make ridiculous statements like this? 

 > having a visual as your main position is always questionable 

If visual was a primary position, heck a position alone, one that allowed you to lack in the skills needed to be an idol, maybe, just maybe you’d have a leg to stand on but no, this is a secondary title and doesn’t define the idol. They don’t magically get to pass by on their looks. This title is simply attributed to the person most capable of catching the eye of the general public and bringing in people, it doesn’t mean the bs that people like you have decided it means.

> Kill the visual position 

Well it’s not a position, so nothing to kill.

May 8, 2020 6:00 am ET

Not long ago, Americans’ knowledge of South Korean products didn’t go much beyond Samsung Galaxies and Hyundai Elantras. That is no longer the case.

Less than a decade after “Gangnam Style” nearly broke YouTube, the wildly popular boy band BTS was scheduled to tour some of the U.S.’s largest football stadiums before the coronavirus pandemic intervened. In February, “Parasite” from South Korean director Bong Joon-ho became the first foreign language film to win Best Picture at the Academy Awards.

Now another Korean cultural export has an unexpected opportunity to find an audience on the other side of the world: its version of America’s pastime. But can the Korea Baseball Organization really replace Major League Baseball for U.S. fans—even for just a little while?

The KBO began its season Tuesday after a five-week pandemic delay, making Korea’s 10-team professional baseball league the highest profile sports entity on the planet that’s currently operating.

In its unending quest to provide 24-hour sports content in a world with no sports, ESPN jumped in, reaching an agreement to broadcast six KBO games a week live. Despite the difficult start times—contests begin between 1 a.m. and 5:30 a.m. ET—baseball fans desperate for something other than replays of games from 20 years ago have a prospective outlet. It has left longtime KBO followers wondering if, like music and movies, Korean baseball can find a place in the U.S.

“I’m not saying the KBO has the potential to be as big as K-Pop in the States,” said Sung Min Kim, a former American baseball writer who now works in the front office of the KBO’s Lotte Giants. “But there is something to it.”

The longer Major League Baseball is on pause, the more likely it is that Americans will sample the KBO. MLB hopes to open its season in July and is exploring different ideas for how that might be doable, but the viability of any plan remains unknown as cases of Covid-19 continue to climb.

In Korea, which has a population of more than 51 million, new cases of the coronavirus have slowed to a trickle. KBO games are being played with no fans in attendance. Barehanded high-fives are prohibited and chewing tobacco has been banned to deter spitting, but for the most, normal life has resumed.

“The handling of the pandemic is a huge source of national pride,” said Christopher Park, the president of East Rock Institute, a Connecticut-based nonprofit devoted to Korean and Korean-American studies.

Knowledge about the KBO in America is limited, especially when compared with the Nippon Professional Baseball in Japan. About two dozen Koreans have played in the major leagues, from former pitchers Chan Ho Park and Byung-Hyun Kim to current talents like Shin-Soo Choo, Ji-Man Choi and Hyun-Jin Ryu. Some American players have also had success returning to MLB after a stint in the KBO, like Washington Nationals first baseman Eric Thames.

Though KBO’s fan base in the U.S. is small, one part of its profile is big: social-media clips of the league’s ostentatious bat flips. In the KBO, home runs are typically accompanied with a dramatic, over-the-top bat flip—the kind of behavior that would result in a fastball to the rib cage in MLB. The showmanship and displays of emotion had turned KBO highlights into viral sensations even before full games were available on the nation’s most popular sports network.

To “see live baseball on ESPN and it’s the KBO, I literally have to pinch myself,” said Dan Kurtz, who has run the English-language website MyKBO.net for nearly two decades. “It’s like, is this true?”

It’s definitely true. ESPN has put most of its A-list baseball talent on the KBO games. The announcers are staying awake through the night—or waking up well before dawn—to call the action on monitors from their homes. For Eduardo Pérez, that means carving out a spot in his garage. Karl Ravech is announcing the games from a space just off his bedroom, where he’s trying not to bother his family too much.

The telecasts have had technical glitches and some minor hiccups as the announcers grow accustomed to working together while physically apart. They’ve also had to learn an entirely new league in a matter of days, something Ravech said has been made easier by his experience broadcasting South Korean teams in the Little League World Series over the years.

The goal, Pérez said, is to “give this league an opportunity and introduce a new set of athletes to fans of the game.” For the first couple of weeks, Ravech said he intends to try to simply introduce viewers to some of the differences between KBO and MLB, in the hopes of ultimately turning the broadcast into a “three-hour baseball hangout.”

“This is the time of year people look to baseball,” Ravech said. “This returns, to some extent, the regularity and rhythm that the absence of Major League Baseball has left.”

Nobody expects Korean baseball played in the wee hours of the morning to completely fill the sports-sized hole in the hearts of Americans. But in the Korean-American community, the KBO becoming the beacon for all of global sports is another giant step in what has been a boom time for Korean culture around the world.

Daniel Kim, a journalist who covers the KBO in Korea, said that while growing up in the U.S. he “was never really proud of being Korean or our culture.” Classmates would tease him about the smell of Korean food and balk at coming to his home.

Now Kim has a nephew who lives in Sarasota, Fla., who is constantly asking him to send BTS merchandise that he can share with his friends. His favorite baseball player is Choi, the Korean first baseman for the Tampa Bay Rays. And now, Korean baseball is on TV.

“He‘s living in a completely different world,” Kim said. “Being Korean-American is all of a sudden considered cool.”"

LDW was fantastic in the scene where both doppelgängers meet! I hope now that both are in the same universe, we get more of him.

JTE & LG’s reunion could have been so damn good but LMH really let me down in that scene. KGE gave her all in the scene, you could feel her affection and her sheer relief at seeing him again but we got absolutely nothing from him, despite him having done quite well in the last ep with the romantic scenes.

That pantsuit scene and all the flashy crap associated with Koo Se-Ryung is boring already and unneeded. I want the character to have been the strong woman we saw in the war room, not one obsessed with her appearance and constantly scheming against the King so that she can be Queen, I hate that storyline.

Lee Rim, we get so little of him, yet he’s becoming one of my fav villains because he’s unapologetic in his actions and scheming so well.

I’ve had suspicions that Korea LG isn’t dead and I hope that he’s not completely brainwashed by Lee Rim and can help Corea LG, in fact I wouldn’t be surprised if he takes up the Kings place, if not permanently, then temporarily, whilst C LG traipses* about Korea.

I also suspect C LG is the one who saved K LG, depending on how he’s been trained by Lee Rim, he probably knows a bit more about how the travelling between worlds works."
KDRAMA,fpxn7yv,t1_fpw8egt,1588985746.0,"> (I seriously need to get over this but I can't. I keep thinking about what it would be like for someone from a parallel Indian subcontinent to land up here and discover what happened to us in 1947. Wouldn't they be paralysed by grief? I guess LMH's character is supposed to be cool and intellectually distant enough that he just processed it all off-screen.)

This bothered me as well, you’d expect an ounce of grief on his face at discovering what happened, after taking in all of the negative history but instead he’s wooden and acting silly, following JTE around.

As a a person from the subcontinent I can imagine how devastated an alt person would be to see how the country got divided and now there’s still so many problems."

Happy Town, weird program, had potential and decade later I still think remember it and wish there’d been a s2 at least.

Endgame, it was kinda formulaic but it was interesting with the limitations the main character had.

Apparitions, this was perfection but unfortunately too much for bbc viewers and we lost it before a season 2 could happen :("

I’ve been playing since day 1, The only “break” I had was when I lost my acc and had to make a new one. I can’t even explain how difficult I find games like this to be and how little patience I have for these things but I stuck through it, played every day and I loved improving and seeing how everyone else was doing.

> There is no depressive ending
>I will see you in this memory forever, forever young

Knowing you’ll grow older than the ones who left is so hard to take but I like that the music both of them worked on is framing it in a uplifting way.


> If this is a nightmare, I won’t wake up forever

Anyone who’s lost someone will keenly feel this sentiment :(

> Eternity means sand castle 

Really love this line because even though sandcastles are temporary, they can be built again and again. In our memories we can revisit our loved ones whenever we wish and that space in our mind is like an island. “A small island made by each other”, as without the other person we wouldn’t have this memory, this island. 

Ok I gotta go cry this one out 😭"
