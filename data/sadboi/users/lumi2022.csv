It's been years now since I felt happiness and I think I'm finally ready to let go. Okay, sorry I just babbled so much about myself but basically I understand how you feel.

One thing though please try not to give up hope. I had a friend just like you. He was 25 and had never been with anyone. Was still a virgin, never had a first kiss, never even held hands, absolutely nothing. It was a major source of his depression to say the least. He felt absolutely unloved and to top that off, he felt or in his mind he ""knew"" he would be alone forever. The thing is apparently he had a close friend that he'd known for ages. They were both looking for someone and were trying to help each other out in the dating world. And then randomly the friend told him they had feelings for him, and of course he had no idea. Everything progressed from there. They ended up moving in together and moving to a different state. He literally wasn't expecting it at all. He believed he was destined to be alone, and he became suicidal as a result. Please just don't give up hope. You never know when things can change. I know that's way easier said than done though, and I'm sorry that's the case :/"

That everyone's pain must go away at some point or another. I'm not sure that's even possible. I'm really sorry you're dealing with this. I'm on the same exact boat with you. My depression is so severe and also treatment resistant. I've tried countless medications and also therapy and nothing has helped. I think I'm reaching the end. im tired of struggling, and the pain just won't go away. My circumstances arent helping the situation either. Life is so so hard, well for most of us. I just dont get it. Why? Why is there suffering? Why are we suffering? I just dont understand.

One thing you mentioned is you've decided to keep everything in. That's probably the worst thing you can do :/. I know the feeling of feeling like you're not even worth anyone's time. Like who am I to waste your time trying to help me. I'm literally nothing. I know the feeling, trust me. It's like you want so deeply for someone to love you, to care, but at the same time you feel you dont deserve it. Please though, you are worth something even though it feels like you're not. You mentioned the fact that you've still pushed through and made it through school. That's huge, even though you may not realize it. Please seek help if you havent already.

Now, I'm just barely existing. Juat a shell of my former self wondering why I'm even still holding on.

It sounds a lot like severe depression with psychotic features or psychosis, if you will. It happens in a percentage of people with severe depression. From what I've read, it's absolutely terrible as I'm sure you already know, because not only do you have the symptoms of depression, but you also have symptoms of psychosis too, and thus begin to lose touch with reality. I'm sure that was very scary, but it seems like you've come through.

For me, my depression has gotten so bad. My circumstances are equally as bad, and sometimes I just feel like I have the worst luck. The two coupled together have made me seriously consider ending it all. I'm in pain everyday, just for the next day to be exactly the same. There's no light at the end of the tunnel for me.

At this point, I'm close to giving up because I've tried so much. One thing I will say is sometimes you have to keep trying and trying until you find the right medication for you. Antidepressants work slightly different and therefore, you may respond different to one over another one. There's also a different class of medications called atypical antipsychotics, such as rexulti and abilify. The name sounds scary, but it's often prescribed for depressed people who don't respond solely to antidepressants. I truly hope there's something out there that can help"

depression,faca6jx,t3_e8hs0s,1575935953.0,"Hi, this post didn't go as expected at all. I thought you were going to say you're depressed because you may have cancer, not that you'd be hoping for it. I can't say I blame you though. I wish I could say you're wrong for wanting cancer to kill you or whatever. Truth is, I'm exactly where you're at mentally. I'm 23, and I've had depression since I was 15. I have treatment resistant depression as well, and I've literally tried probably over 10 medications to no avail. Unfortunately, my brain doesn't even have the man power to count all the meds I've been on, but I've literally been on almost every SSRI and SNRI out there. Just like you, I'm exhausted. I have other things going on in my life making everything 10 times worse, and I've reached the end. I don't believe I'll make it past this year.

You're 18 though, and I'm sorry you're dealing with this. I know the shit show depression is. It messes everything up. It has literally ruined my life. I feel like a 15 year old being dramatic, but God or whomever knows it's the literal truth. 

I wish the best for you. The best being whichever outcome you want. I'm not here to tell you suicide or wanting to die isn't the answer. There aren't many answers for people like us with treatment resistant depression. It's not ""curable"" like typical depression. I hope you find peace whether in this life or the next one. You deserve it xx"
depression,f8u6xpu,t1_f8u0zrd,1574820912.0,"Oh okay, I see. I'm sorry you've tried so many things and it hasn't worked. Definitely mention Deplin to your doctor. Deplin is the prescription strength l-methyl folate. It comes in 7.5mg and 15mg."
depression,f8tyucg,t3_e27ei0,1574814709.0,"Hey, I'm sorry your depression is so stubborn and hasn't responded to treatment. Mine is the same way :/. There's a few things that come to mind that you could try if you haven't already. Firstly, l methyl folate. It's prescription name is deplin. It's targeted for people with depression that don't respond to treatment, as folate levels can be lower in people with treatment resistant depression. You take it in conjunction with your antidepressant for maximum effect. Just make sure you're getting l methyl folate and not folic acid. Also, there's fish oil, specifically EPA. Fish oil contains both DHA and EPA, but the EPA is most beneficial for depression. You want to look for something that has EPA that's at least higher than 500mg. You can get EPA at GNC or any local health good store. Just keep in mind all fish oil isn't created equally. Most fish oil from the drugstore is low in EPA, not of good quality, and rancid by the time you're ready to take it. Nordic Naturals has a good brand of fish oil. It's called ""Nordic Naturals Ultimate Omega"". Lastly, there's N Acetyl Cysteine. also known as NAC. It's an antioxidant and helps various mental illnesses, including depression. There's quality research on all of these. It's not just some random anecdotes from random people online. There's actual evidence to suggest efficacy for everything I've mentioned.

I really hope something helps and you can win this fight. Good luck! :)"

I did do that surgery called endoscopic thoracic sympathectomy, and it was probably the worst decision of my life. I would not recommend it at all. I would recommend trying antiperspirant wipes that are high in aluminum chloride, specifically made for people who sweat excessively. Also, there's a website called kleinerts  and they sell all things for people who sweat excessively, including undershirts and sweat shields. It's totally worth a shot.

I have so much bad shit going on in my life right now not even including my depression. Then, add depression to that, I'm honestly suffering. For her to tell me that, even though I know she was coming from a good place, just made me feel even worse. I literally have no energy. I barely make it to work everyday.

Reading your post did not seem like that of someone who dropped out in 9th grade. Also, I can see the compassion you have despite the hardships you've been through. It was evident when you spoke about your mother and the guilt you feel for not graduating not even just for you, but for her. You are a good person. You have a heart.

It sounds more like depersonalization based on what you've described. You're not going crazy. Depersonalization/derealization can be linked to many different mental illnesses, including depression, so it could just be a result of the severity of it right now. Anxiety can also cause it.

I read through some of your post history (sorry), and I really think it's possible that your parents didnt show you the adequate love you needed growing up maybe? That they created these high expectations for you, and now that you're not reaching them, you're somehow the worst person on earth. I want to let you know that you are not. You are more than what your family ""thinks"" you are. Depression will tell you otherwise, but your depression brain is one biased asshole.
I know it's going to be so so hard, but you can still create your own standards and expectations for yourself. Living an okay or date I say ""happy"" life doesn't mean you have to be a lawyer or doctor like your family expects you to be. It can mean making enough to survive while having extra money to do things like travel occasionally. It can mean finding a hobby that interests you or even just finding a job that interests you, even if you don't make as much as a lawyer per se. You are so much more than you think, and I'm sorry the people around you haven't been there to tell you that.

I hope this comment doesn't sound pushy or like I know everything. I know I know nothing, unfortunately. I can just see the pain in your posts and wanted to try and help.

I have severe treatment resistant depression, so TMS has been offered as a solution to me. I'm nervous for various reasons, but in a way also nervous about lack of suicidal thoughts, because I may no longer have an out.

depression,f3vke8i,t3_dif8pj,1571178088.0,"Hi, I know you're tried a lot. I have too. I hate my life and I'm trying so hard not to hate everything in it, but it's getting extremely hard. I know you've mentioned medication. Are you currently taking anything? I've been reading up on supplements to take in addition to medication. Supplements that have actually scientific research done to show efficacy. May I suggest looking into L- methyl folate (not folic acid btw) and N Acetyl cysteine. The former is sometimes low in people with treatment resistant depression and is also given to people with schizophrenia. There's actually a prescription grade l methyl folate called deplin in the US. N-acetyl cysteine can be given as an adjunct to meds for depression, OCD, and schizophrenia. It's an antioxidant and increases the brain's ability to produce glutathione I believe. Again, there's actual scientific research on both. So, I'm not one of the random people saying, ""just change your diet and it'll fix everything!"". Because we both know it's obviously never that simple. Also, these supplements are normally taken in conjunction with prescription meds for optimum efficacy, but you could always try them on their own too.

Hope I don't sound pushy. I've been doing so much research because I have treatment resistant depression and literally NOTHING has helped. I hope at least one suggestion helps even a bit."

I've been heavily contemplating suicide and the thought of a possibly afterlife free of all this shit on earth gets me through. Your perspective that after death we're in a state of nothing is definitely possible too. I'd say either would be better than the crap we're facing now. Idk, the only thing is before we were born we did not exist of course, so we of course weren't aware of anything before our birth. The only thing is now that we're alive, death may not be the same, because we now exist. Maybe we will still be aware or experience an after life. I've been looking into near death experiences and many people talk about seeing a light or being filled with love. Some people of course report there being nothing, just blackness, but I keep holding on to the fact that maybe after leaving this shithole, we'll finally find peace.

depression,f002qp1,t1_ezxqail,1568296415.0,"Oh no, that's terrible :/. Yeah, I think ECT is out of the question for me because of the severe memory impairment. I definitely cant risk that. 

Yeah, definitely check out TMS. It's non invasive and is supposed to be targeted for people like us with treatment resistant depression. It's worth a shot!"
depression,f001z1a,t1_ezxtu9t,1568296110.0,"Yeah, so trintellix is actually a newer antidepressants not an antipsychotic to my knowledge. I was actually on a low dose of both venlafaxine and wellbutrin that worked for me. It was venlefaxine 75mg and wellbutrin 100 mg.

I havent tried tricyclics yet as I'm too afraid of the side effects. I'm not really keen on trying those honestly.

Thanks, I'm trying to stay positive but of course that's extremely hard when I feel like crap every moment of everyday. I'm looking into trying TMS as a last resort because I cannot keep living this way. If that doesn't work, I think I'll have no choice but to end it unfortunately. 

Are you finding any relief on the meds you're on? You're on quite a few, are you feeling any side effects on them?"
depression,ezxq4ic,t1_ezxor0l,1568246806.0,"I haven't tried ketamine because I can't afford it. I'm really sorry it didn't work for you though, ugh :/ 

Hmm you say they experienced severe side effects with TMS? I heard it had very few side effects I thought? I know ECT is horrid for memory and cognitive abilities, but I heard that TMS is the less invasive option, that's the only reason I've been considering it. What kind of side effects did your aunts experience? Now I'm getting a bit weary about doing it :/"
depression,ezxpqvk,t3_d2yve6,1568246523.0,"Hey there! I think this is an interesting conversation you've brought up. Just warning you in advance, my answers are gonna be boring/short :/.

I'm currently on Rexulti 1mg, trintellix 10mg, propranalol 10 mg as needed, atarax 25-50 mg nightly.

1 & 2. Unfortunately, I'm feeling no relief from the meds I'm currently on.

3. I was pretty depressed when I started with suicidal thoughts, severe anhedonia. Unfortunately, I'm still currently there now.

4. I've been through countless SSRIs, SNRI's, and atypical antipsychotics. I had a 2 year relief period from 2014-2015 on a combo of wellbutrin and venlafaxine but both stopped working landing me back at square 1.

5. Side effects include weight gain, increased appetite, and fatigue. 

6. I would say to anyone struggling with depression now to continue trying different meds until you find one that helps. Most people find at least some relief, so don't give up!"
depression,ezxnt1n,t3_d2z1gj,1568245085.0,"Hey there. You're not alone. I have tried countless SSRI's, 2 SSNRI's, atypical antipsychotics, and wellbutrin and nothing has worked. I've been depressed since I was 15, 16 and I'm 23 now. I'm at the lowest I've ever been :(. I am at the point where I feel completely hopeless. My last option is TMS and if that doesnt work, I think I'll have no choice but to end it, because I can't keep living this way. I have severe anhedonia as well, and it completely sucks. I just want you to know that you're not alone. I wish I could say that things get better; I truly hope they will for you."

Yeah, I definitely agree. The lack of emotions is extremely challenging. I also deal with pretty bad anhedonia, so basically hardly anything interests me anymore. It's been tough. I have severe depression and it's also treatment resistant, so no medication has really worked for me, unfortunately. It really sucks! 

Do you find that overall mentally you're in a better place? Well, minus the memory/cognitive issues of course."

OP, I'm sorry your dealing with this. I'm sorry you feel like suicide is the only way out. It sounds like you dont want to make it harder on your family by having them see a gory scene.

One thing you said is you feel like you can never measure up, but I think that's your depressive mind talking because you can. I know it's hard to believe that, but I hope you can one day. 

I also feel the same. I feel that suicide may be my only option because it's becoming harder and harder to believe that things could get better when they've been so bad for so long. I don't actually want to die, I just dont want to keep living and feeling the way I am now. I hope we both can keep pushing a little longer"
depression,exr49t9,t3_cu467d,1566510944.0,"Hi, I know this is incredibly frustrating. I'm in a similar position to you with physical symptoms, yet blood work comes back normal. Super frustrating because the people around you are left feeling like you're making it up, and you're left feeling invalidated. I would say the joint or muscle pain sounds a lot like fibromyalgia. Try looking it up and see if you're symptoms are the same. Depression has a wide range of symptoms and can often cause physical symptoms as well, so that could be a possibility too. Also, maybe you could try going to a different doctor for a second opinion? I hope things get better"
depression,exqj0ww,t3_cu2aby,1566502832.0,"Hey you, please dont give up. I am right there with you. Your first paragraph literally describes me so much I thought I wrote it. I've tried everything. Therapy, medication, christianity. I even thought being closer to God was working for a while but everything continued to get worse. One bad thing after another. I hate to say it but at this moment I question whether God is real. I keep on trying to hold on for my family, but I'm starting not to see the point anymore. I'm struggling too bad, I feel too alone. I feel like I've reached my breaking point and can't do it any longer. 

Anyway, i didn't mean to pile that all on you. I said all that to say you're not alone in struggling, even though it probably feels that way. Please don't kill yourself. I would care and I know the people around you would too. I understand exactly how you're feeling because I'm right there too. You're a special human. Please don't beat yourself up for things you think you've messed up. It sounds to me like in all of this you're doing your best and that's what counts. Please try and remember that.

There are people struggling due to physiological components out of their control contributing to depression.

depression,ewwgz9d,t3_cqi66x,1565828018.0,"As someone who is severely depressed with suicidal thoughts, I wish my ex responded in the way that you did. Whether being comforting, or just the plain old ""I'm so sorry you're dealing with this. I will stick by you"" response. Personally, it never gets old hearing that. It sounds to me that you're doing what you can and trying numerous responses in various approaches, but I guess her depression and anger are heavily affecting her responses to you, which I can understand too. My question is, is she speaking to a therapist or possible psychiatrist about this? That would probably help a ton. Even if you went with her to therapy once to get a better idea of what if feels like for her. I think that could help.

I think you're doing the best you can. Please don't give up on her. Depression is such a complex illness and affects one in so many ways. I really hope everything works out for you all."

I deal with both depersonalization and derealization and both make you feel so foreign as if you're not yourself and you're in a dream. The best thing I can suggest is grounding techniques. Focus on stimuli around you and remember that everything around you is real even though it may not feel that way. It's important to pay attention to sounds and sensations to remind your brain to be present
