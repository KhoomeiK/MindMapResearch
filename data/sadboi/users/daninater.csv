My anxiety levels have dropped down enough where I can enjoy music again. I sleep better, I'm at home more often and have the entire summer off to stay home and garden. In fact I cut out my weekly 600 mile commute.  I don't have any guilt about not going to social events - what few there are left. And in all of those senses it's been great. Financially it's easier (take this in the short term only), I have time to work on myself again and haven't felt as low stress as I do now in several years. I work in aviation. My pay was being reduced by 25% due to the bottom falling out of the industry. This left me with the choice of a leave of absence and staying at home. And I really like it to be honest. My only worry is that I like it too much and never want to socialize when this finally passes over. But for now, I'm going to ""worry"" about my tomatoes."

aww,fppvs4c,t3_gevlck,1588810116.0,I have a phobia of moths. I’ll crop it down. I’m fine. Everything is fine.
mentalhealth,fpf2hia,t3_gd314v,1588560252.0,"It’s really kind of you to ask how to help. I don’t see that a lot, thank you. Hmm...

It’s not their fault they’re afflicted, but it’s their responsibility to manage it. Seeking help when needed, being actively involved in treatment. Accepting help when it’s offered from others. Medication or therapy or both, there’s a responsibility to take care of yourself as best you can, I think. It’s ok to hold people suffering from anxiety and depression to that. Being supportive, being a good listener is helpful. 

Personally, my thoughts may not be rational, but the feelings I’m experiencing are no less legitimate. Please respect that. You can help people by keeping that in mind. 

Example. I used to have a specific phobia of moths. Still do but not as bad. They terrified me - so, when I went skydiving for the first time the FIRST thing I thought when I landed was it wasn’t nearly as scary as a moth. I’m trying to help you gauge how it feels... But when you see an adult flailing around because a big is flying at him it’s funny I get it, but not funny if you appreciate how they make me feel. Even though I can see it’s not reasonable, I still feel bothered. An appreciation or empathy for things like that helps a lot. It’s hard to do if you’re not wired wrong. Hope you can catch my drift here..."

-Prozac 20mg/Ambien 10mg at night for 6 months - not really. I definitely felt an immediate relief of having sought help the first time, taking a pill probably had some placebo effect initially. Sexual side effects in college.
-Prozac Weekly another 6 months, ambien CR at night - no (same SSRI drug, but I was freaking out taking a pill every day so I tried the time release once a week), side effects continued. Persistent insomnia being driven by the anxiety and extended release kept me asleep at night.
-Switched to Celexa in several increments up to a higher dosage which I can’t remember, with Ambien CR during the night, as this was a more selective SSRI, but I still had problems with side effects and no real benefits. Started talk therapy at this time which WAS helpful. Maybe for another 6-8 months
-Xanax prescribed at this time after panic attacks, just a few doses to have on hand.
-Wellbutrin XL, with an SSRI I believe was celexa, probably for another 6-8 months 
-Then klonopin daily eventually settling at a dose of between 2-3mg PRN, as needed. At which point I haven’t needs to take a higher dose for the past several years, and try to step down .5 mg to 1mg eventually if I’m not going through a thing.  

No tolerance issues I’ve noticed with the benzo. I did cease taking Ambien last year and didn’t know the difference - THAT I did develop a tolerance to. And what’s helped the most besides a pill is running/jogging. Draining physical exercise helps with sleep, well being, self esteem."
