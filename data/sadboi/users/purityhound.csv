ftm,fqywval,t3_glj6ui,1589755938.0,"I went by Rhys for a while! I don‚Äôt consider it overly ‚Äútrans‚Äù in a stereotypical way but I can tell you my experience with it. I was out during my middle teen years and had a stint in the hospital for a while (psych ward). I got very upset that they kept making me sit with the girls instead of the boys and one of the nurses on duty said that ‚ÄúRhys is a girl name, you can‚Äôt expect anyone to take you seriously.‚Äù

Hated that guy, and Rhys is distinctly a masculine name, but you do come across people who‚Äôll think you‚Äôre just saying ‚ÄúReese‚Äù which is perceived more femininely. Fun fact, the Reese‚Äôs candy are named after the dude who created them, so that‚Äôs a good retort if it‚Äôs brought up.

I think it also depends on locale though. But it‚Äôs a good name."

books,fnn47h9,t3_g2j1od,1587084045.0,I realize the AMA is over but just in case you do read this: Thank you. Unwind sparked my love of books and writing beyond anything else and I hold it close to my heart to this day. Beautifully written and my all-time favorite series.
mentalhealth,fnmte8g,t3_g2odd5,1587077804.0,"I feel the same way. It's been really hard to keep a routine but, after being furloughed from my job, I have all this free time to try and work on my mental health whereas I felt I couldn't before. 

That being said, we should make sure to check in with our friends & family who might not be as lucky."
mentalhealth,fnmt7a8,t3_g2n2hm,1587077699.0,"It really does sound like OCD. Maybe get some resources together to explain how OCD can affect your thinking--that these things must be done, otherwise something truly horrible will happen. If you're not an adult it'll be important to get your parents on board with trying to get him into treatment. 

That being said, if you are an adult, or if your brother is older than 16, I believe you could both consent to medical treatment without having to involve your parents. That should be your last option, though."
mentalhealth,fnmspoj,t3_g2nwfz,1587077428.0,"I went through this same thing with my parents. A lot of them come from a generation and upbringing of ""suck it up, everyone has it bad"". If they're not otherwise abusive or neglectful they probably do care but don't understand. But either way -- as others have said, reach out to others in your life if you can. Even if it's an anonymous chat online. You're not alone and you can come out on the other side! 

Take small steps, anything at all--even if it doesn't seem like it'll help. Just keep getting out of bed. I'm proud of you for opening up even if it wasn't the response you needed."
mentalhealth,fnmsd0q,t1_fnkpi0q,1587077236.0,This comment. Although I'd discuss it with the S/O first--your feelings should matter and she should listen to your concerns because alcoholism can kill. Express to her and to your dad that you want him to be happy and healthy. But as said: make sure it's done properly and that he doesn't do something like quit cold turkey.

AskAstrologers,fjj2ggt,t3_fdmdpc,1583381547.0,"A good starting point is just putting your chart in somewhere, looking up what ""x in x"" means,  reading the summaries and descriptions, and work from there. I started with the planets, then the houses, and then degrees. And remember there are no ""bad"" placements. There may be placements that are challenging to work with, but that's it."

AskAstrologers,fje5de0,t1_fje56lb,1583265554.0,"You'll be okay. Like another comment said, the fact you asked this does show that you're concerned about having a good relationship with your kid, which is more than a lot of parents can say. So it sounds like you're off to a good start with that."
AskAstrologers,fje3bb6,t3_fd0234,1583264414.0,"Just be a good parent. Astrology is fun and scary accurate, but it's not great to already have preconceived notions about your child based on their sign."
mentalhealth,fjddhuw,t3_fcuvhc,1583251069.0,"I believe at 16, at least in the US, you can see a doctor without your parent's permission. Look around for low-cost clinics if you don't have insurance, or try to get access to your insurance info or card if you do. Check in with your school, too. They may have resources you can fall back on. Talk to a teacher you trust for advice."
