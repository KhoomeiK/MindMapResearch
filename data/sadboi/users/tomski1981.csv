Consider starting with rejection therapy. Purposely put yourself in situations and ask strangers for something that you know they will say no to. Excuse me, can I borrow $1000? Excuse me, if you have a minute can we have a staring contest... I‚Äôm really good? Etc. Have fun with it. Do one a day for a month. 

Exposure therapy could be next. Start pushing your comfort zone. Try to talk to people. Or talk to them longer than you normally do. Or talk to more people than you usually do. Say a comment to the stranger in front of you in line. Or, strike up a conversation with them. 

Start building meaningful relationships. Don‚Äôt set the bar too high. Anyone that is friendly / nice to you will do. You won‚Äôt be best friends day 1, but start considering them as your friends. Slowly share some personal things with them, but not everything and not all at once. Just little tiny facts that naturally could come up in conversation.

I would recommend the audio book ‚ÄúHow to be yourself‚Äù.

My personal favorite method is mindfulness. Using your mind to change your behavior that changes your thoughts. I developed my own multi-step method that works for me."

Sounds like the first person you have to convince is the inner you. It may seem weird for me to put it this way, but you have a struggle between what your frontal lobe (logic/reasoning) and amygdala (emotions/fear). In anxiety, as you may know, the amygdala tends to be overactive and the frontal lobe has slightly less influence than typical.

There are various ways to cope. Having a friend you can be open with and talk to would be very helpful. Depending on severity you may also need therapy or antidepressants.
