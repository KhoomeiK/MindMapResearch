depression,fke0rzp,t1_fkbas3u,1584102004.0,"They've been okay, it could be better. Sometimes I overeat and other times I don't have an appetite. My water consumption is always good, that's one of the few things I do consistently, because it has become a good habit of mine. I do lack sleep. I go to bed maybe around 9 pm and fall asleep, but around 1 or 2 am I'm awake and can't fall asleep anymore until 3 or 4 am, but I have to get up at 7 am. So that's very frustrating."

depression,falm3hc,t3_cml6ni,1576186646.0,"Today wasn't my day. I got some bad grades back and teared up a lot in class. My teachers know that I'm going through a rough phase and they have confidence in me. But why don't I also have confidence in myself? I'm so exhausted and suicidal thoughts are rising up again. To cope with these thoughts I make myself exhausted through working on my homework until late in the night. I want to rest, but I couldn't do it this time. And my hope is beginning to crumble."

MakeupAddiction,eza6k4s,t3_d0jdse,1567795747.0,"One of my first eyeshadow palettes was the ‘I Heart Make up Chocolate Orange Palette’. 
It’s pretty cheap, but still good if you’re a beginner and don’t want to splure all your money.  Right now I have the Jeffree Star Cosmetics ‘Blood Sugar Palette’. This palette was very expensive for me, but I love it on my brown eyes and it’s very pigmented. But I’d only recomend it when you feel comfortable enougj with your eyeshadow skills. Btw the youtube channel  ‘TheMakeupchair’ is very good when you’re a beginner. I got a lot of comments when I followed her tutorials, it’s worth to take a look at. (She also has a video for brown eyes) 😜"

Adoption,eyz9o6i,t3_czhapr,1567612767.0,"I’m an adoptee from china and my mom said I changed a lot for the better when I visited my home town. I saw that my future there wouldn’t be great and that I probably had to be a hidden child. Since then my family said I was more confident and didn’t ask that many questions about my adoption. Also I live only with my mom, but she’s the best and she does everything to make me happy. I have a great relationship with her and I can talk with her about my insecurities related to my adoption. So for me it hasn’t had a traumatic impact."
