If you exercise routinely and you meditate but you don't feel a difference when you mediate maybe it's time to learn more. That is if you can, I observed quite profound results after a couple of tries of proper vipassana.

And unlike you I'm actually worried I WON'T be able to do this till I'm 60. I'm naturally a bit more introverted, I don't feel like traveling to the moon (or insert place here) is necessary for me to have fun , I don't really enjoy ""entertainment"" ,(I enjoy learning though), I don't enjoy ""hang outs"" as much as I enjoy work . Yes, that's the truth (both are necessary though), and whenever i vacation I eventually get tired, but this was when I was more nervous than I'm now.

Look at it from all angles, maybe you didn't have the freedom of autonomy, maybe small companies might help, maybe you didn't have good coworkers, maybe you could look into freelance work from some of your skills. What made some of those jobs better than others. 

Maybe you didn't really hate some of them."
psychology,fn61fj2,t1_fn60i2n,1586683680.0,"I guess that advice needs more working then. But it still is a good starting point.

I said this to someone else too maybe you could find something that's more bearable, doable and time passable work than those hobbies if you could you might have hit a lottery. Work really is a very important part of life, you spend the best times in your office, might as well not get suckered into the mentality you hold right now. I could imagine myself in something like digital marketing for example. Because it involves creativity, variety, writing, influencing, and needs problem solving.

To me you sound like creative soul, who gets bored very easily, unfortunately not every creative person wins the lottery, best of luck. Maybe you could seek some career professional to help with this process, psychology knows allot about the human condition and personality than we give it credit for. But I don't know how credible career counselors but I'd most probably give it a go if I were you."
psychology,fn54rrt,t1_fn52gr8,1586655907.0,"Maybe I could offer an insight here,

Yes the wage slave hypothesis might be and is true for a lot of people but to others who probably base their existence on their work it's do much more than that. People talk about the rat race, maybe it's a way for me personally to gamify the whole situation. I'm very privileged in that sense even if I'm not very rich or in the richest countries, I'm happy just tinkering with technology in my daily work.

I could offer some advice on how I ended up choosing this career, maybe firstly I didn't have many options, I was very bad at office work that involved allot of attention, there went my shot at banks, accounting, documentation, and everything like that.

But what really made me be satisfied with my decision was  the notion of childhood ingraining things in you and even when you are an adult. That is , I was obsessed as a child with computers and technology, that imprint was inside me when I thought I was totally disinterested. Of course technology is everywhere now so it might have been an easier decision for me. 

The point is, the advice following passion is redundant , but following what could be passion inducing based on your childhood experiences, personality, ability might be better path."

You could try mindfulness apps on Google store. I recommend an app called Mindfulness. (Not fully free)
