unpopularopinion,fr599hk,t1_fr5900e,1589904728.0,"Yeah and you’re still not getting it. Women don’t just blindly hate men for no reason. If you see a woman who “hates” “men”, and don’t automatically assume it’s for VERY GOOD VALID REASONS, whether you are personally aware of her life story or not, then you are absolutely what I’ve described and am pointing out. 

You being unaware of it, doesn’t mean it’s not true.

Women posting an occasional tweet aren’t more valid than women who are frequent complainers of men. That’s just your male ego validating your male ego world belief."

She needs to be treated way better. She needs to be the center of attention, she needs cuddling, she needs to be pet endlessly, told in a cute voice she is a good girl.

Cuddle her until her tail heals. Every day, hours a day, whatever it takes. Rub her tail for her, for blood flow. Kiss her. Hug her. Please please."
unpopularopinion,fr57ybh,t1_fr55z5b,1589904075.0,"Yes it’s true that people are hard on men with the opposite, and I’m sorry you have been abused by a woman, and I 100% believe you without knowing you. You didn’t deserve that and also have valid reason to have baggage from that, or pain. Any person can be abusive regardless of gender, race, creed, anything.

AND your one experience (or even a few) still just does not compare to a collective of what “women” experience from “men”, as an overall power dynamic. It’s beyond an abusive relationship. It’s beyond some guy who hurt their feelings. 

You don’t have to invalidate their very real experience, to acknowledge your own. Your experience is in no way invalidated, or less important, by validating women’s experiences. 

If anything, you should focus MORE on validating theirs because you understand what it’s like to be abused by a bad person. So to NOT do that, and keep it a battle of which gender gets more attention, is only feeding the problem women face, where men, just like you, invalidate THEM. And because they get invalidated by men, they think men suck. Just like you hear of. Just like you’ve described in this post.

If you want validation, give it too, first. To both yourself and others. Your experience coexists with theirs. None of it is mutually exclusive. All of it matters. Believe women, and believe yourself too."
C_S_T,fr56lwn,t1_fr54pmy,1589903410.0,"So, it has already been identified by brain scans! Not just behavior: It’s behavior that can be highly manipulative with these people, and they can manipulate even the most skilled pathologists, and do it so swiftly that you think you’re the one in control. 

The way they’ve identified the Cluster B empathy wiring of sadism, is from actual brain scans, where, the empathy regions associated with things like love, touch, happiness, joy, that are activated by oxytocin, dopamine, serotonin, watching a cute puppy smile, etc in a “normal” (Neurotypical) person, are activated in let’s say, a sadistic Psychopath, when they view bloody mutilation and hear screaming of pain. 

When that Psychopathic person (Neurodivergent) experiences love, touch, a smiling puppy, they experience loathing and pain within themselves, and those parts of the brain light up correspondingly. So in order to experience the dopamine and serotonin that makes a “healthy” brain, makes you feel happy and content, that person (sadistic) will have to seek out violence and suffering of others, in whatever way suits their personal taste. 

It’s a chemical brain addiction similar to any other addiction, except that if you have a NT brain, your addiction to the good stuff (smiling puppies) isn’t in question. If you are a sadistic Psychopath (with a ND brain) then your addiction to happiness is at the expense of others, by nature.

As for what we can do... It’s a wildly understudied area and I wish more people studied this. I’ve spent years of my life philosophizing what we could ever do about this... No ideas yet... as any level of self-awareness would alter any testing and judgements made...

To me it ends up becoming a larger spiritual issue, also something we don’t study/value in society at all!"
unpopularopinion,fr556ka,t3_gmqojg,1589902696.0,"What you described, happens BECAUSE women collectively HAVE had THAT MANY bad experiences with THAT MANY men, over that long of time, repeatedly, forever, that it actually alters their waking beliefs about them. And rightfully so.

And men collectively HAVE NOT had the same bad experiences with that many women, over time, repeatedly, that it would affect them the same way. 

You basically just described and validated all the misogyny women experience, by complaining about it. Talk to your guy friends about not being shitty people instead of complaining about women for pointing out the disparity. 

Women and men don’t act the same, or get treated the same, or experience the same things, so don’t expect women to coddle your ego and act like your experiences are the same! Your (“men’s”) experiences with women are different and better, overall, collectively, historically, than women’s experiences with men. Accept that women’s experiences are valid and move on.

Accept! Women’s! Experience! As! Valid!"
C_S_T,fr53pgr,t3_gmqg3x,1589901950.0,"Great content!! Glad to hear mention of sociopathy and ASPD — KEY traits of the master illusionists that govern (manipulate) us...

Another thing is that the dark triad personality types (Narcissism, Psychopathy, Machiavellianism), in the Cluster B realm (who also tend to “rule the world” maliciously), tend to be attracted to positions of “absolute” power, and therefore also, psychotherapy. 

There are people who go into therapy with no issues of their own besides needing help escaping from the wrath of a malicious yet covert Narcissist (these people are devastating if they target you) only to enter psychotherapy under the wrath of yet another sadistic Narcissist or Psychopathic personality, who enjoys experiencing the pain of others. 

This therapist will not only gaslight the patient, but also coerce them into full dependency on the therapist, keeping them mentally/emotionally hooked for years, even without drugs, although adding in drugs is typical too. When I say they “enjoy” the pain of others, the Cluster B dark triad types receive dopamine and serotonin when witnessing the suffering of others. Their brains have a mis-wiring of the empathy circuit, leading to them to literally “enjoy” suffering of others, which leads them to lives of sadism.

The overt ones will become grandiose, and enter avenues like politics, stardom, finance, military, anything typical of power-seekers and status climbers. But the covert ones will lurk around in the “do-good” fields (staying very close to the suffering), such as psychotherapy, philanthropy, and other mental/emotional counseling, to ensure a steady flow of their fix (suffering of others), while giving an illusion that they are helpers.

There is very very little documented about this. It’s also very common all healthcare/medicine overall."

TrueOffMyChest,fqvmcnm,t3_gl6fdq,1589680327.0,"Just want to add something: From my (white) perspective, I notice that all cultures appropriate each other, but only White culture appropriates in a way that makes profit/mainstream, and therefore is noticed/criticized.

Let’s talk about Latina hair then too, with braids and edges/baby hairs, durags.

Let’s talk about Black people appropriating Asian cultural norms for fashion, which many Black female artists/rappers make money off of (dressing up in Geisha style or something Hindi/Desi).

Let’s talk about braids in general, that Black people are not the only or first people to ever wear braids. Ancients from all cultures wore braids, even Vikings and Scots, all world cultures, not just African descendants. Partially for utility, and often also partially for religious reasons and social status.

If you only focus on your own racially biased views that say it’s only white people who do this, you’re just not fully educated about the world. It’s a very Black American perspective to have, to think that everything comes down to White People Bad, Black People Saints. Our world is so much more complex than that.

In addition, gatekeeping fashion styles just doesn’t make sense anymore in this modern world. Yes whites were gatekeepers of other things in your family’s history. So, you want to then gatekeep baby hair as a fashion style forever, just to keep exclusivity on baby hairs, just for... For what?

This is why the guy was pissed: He can’t control his animal, so he relies on people continuing to walk by, so that eventually his dog will stop. You stopped, which ruined his normal plan, and the dog kept barking to the point where he now had to change his plan and walk across the street instead. In his mind, you’re the asshole for standing there, because that probably exacerbated his dog more than normal.

You didn’t do anything wrong at all. When I walk my dog, I make sure not to just stand in one place like that though because then it does usually force a longer interaction of barking, than if we just quickly pass the barking dog and move on. It’s a weird nuance. But always do what you feel most safe with, for you and your pup. If standing there was the best bet, you were totally fine to hang back and stand there as long as you felt."

I agree with you basically. I will not let any of this grow me into and ugly racist ultimately, but, for now, as I heal from all of this, I also cannot deny the way these experiences have influenced me, psychologically. My brain has connected these dots: Black People Cause Trauma To Me. It won’t be that way forever because I’ll overcome that, but for now this is my truth, it’s reality.

With that, I am stuck here for the foreseeable future. And none of these neighborhoods where I experienced any of these events, were poor neighborhoods or “ghetto” or crime-ridden or anything with negative stereotypes, just totally average middle-class homeowner type neighborhoods...

TrueOffMyChest,fqno1i5,t3_gjxazu,1589498340.0,"Thanks for posting this. Just last week, my only two black neighbors both (totally separately!) did some bad things and then screamed at me in irrational anger when I confronted them about it. It kind of traumatized me, but if I’m honest, it’s not even close to the first or second or tenth time this has happened. I just stay away from black people at this point because it’s too much of a wildcard. Sure some people are wonderful and kind, but the bad apples that lash out in violence, do so much damage that they traumatize others and probably don’t realize it.

For anyone wondering, neighbor 1 clogged their toilet where it overflowed so badly that their poop water began dripping into my apartment. Not only a huge mess and very expensive, but they would not interact with me when I was trying to ask what was going on up there or try to help. Then when I went outside I caught them red-handed dumping out mopped up buckets of shit water out onto my hallway, stairs, and doorstep. Needless to say, no neighbor would take well to this, and I confronted her about pouring out the shit water on my property. As if it wasn’t enough that her shit water was leaking into my home, she did this too, and then began a ghetto screaming match at me for confronting her about it. And of course played victim as if I had somehow done something against her to warrant being yelled at, or to warrant having her shit water intentionally dumped on my property.

The second neighbor is someone who lets her Psycho Demon Devil Dog off-leash anytime she feels like it. This dog has attacked my dog before, and me, and some other neighbors and dogs, but no one can catch it on camera. The dog attacked my dog viciously for a SECOND TIME, and I had to wrestle the dog off with my own body to allow my dog to escape. I was traumatized, and my dog was doubly traumatized. When the owner finally strolled up to me, holding her dog down, panting, scratched, she laughed at me and told me to “stop abusing her dog”. As if! I confronted her with a quick “you need to be better about keeping your dog controlled, this cannot keep happening”, and she suddenly switched into crazy ghetto screaming girl. From laughing at me, to ghetto anger, in two seconds. She yelled at me for a long time as I walked away, screaming threats (and lies) at me so all the neighbors could hear.

It makes me feel deeply sad when people act like this. I’ve already considered selling my home just to get away from these awful girls, since they are physically the closest to me, and this is how they treat me after YEARS of me being super chill and quiet to them, always saying hello but also minding my business, etc etc... And yes, they are black, black American. And yes I am a white Becky girl. White flight isn’t for nothing. Call me racist, I don’t care, I care more about being safe, far away from contaminated shit water being dumped on me, scream matches, threats, and most importantly, keeping my dog (my companion! My baby!) safe away from psychos."

Are you familiar with MK Ultra, Mind Control, and the concept of Psyops? If not, this sub is a great place to start, if you use the search bar.

Ultimately 5G is a frequency that can allow us to literally live within a Matrix. It allows for mass MASS mass global surveillance. Surveillance you think only exists in dystopian sci fi films, but already (already!!) is FULLY implemented in China. 5G also allows for targeted frequency bursts from anywhere around the globe to any targeted individual. This means that if you do have a nanochip inside of you, the 5G network can target you anywhere on the globe, access your nanochip with a targeted ping, and revoke your access to resources if you dissent.

This is just hardly scratching the surface."

conspiracy,fpl5kvz,t1_fpl0rix,1588706768.0,"You’d be surprised about 5G. It’s covertly rolled out for secret testing in many places, that they won’t announce. This has been documented (and deleted) for years. All over the world people post videos of the day the 5G tower is installed for testing, and immediately there are dead animals and plants, with humans developing sudden tumors and nervous-system responses (seizures, etc) nearby. 5G companies publicly admit they have done no testing besides these non-consensual “tests”. 

Anyone who posts content about it gets banned, deleted, etc. It’s something that’s very hard to track or “show sources” for. Which further discredits the conspiracy, right. Most people who can speak properly to the issues around 5G are super deep anonymous theorists who’ve been tracking it for years. Outside of that, it’s very hard to find the info, as it’s all highly censored.

You can follow the dots individually if you know what to look for. The 5G frequency is 60GHz. Research topics like: 60GHz, oxygen, how the lung uptakes oxygen into the bloodstream, what happens to oxygen in 60GHz frequency, what were the common frequencies of 3G & 4G... You will start to see some interesting things."

TwoXChromosomes,fphx0a7,t1_fpgyhn9,1588629367.0,"So yes what you said is true but in this situation none of that applies.

He wasn’t interested in me, as was clear by my date with him where he raved about his exes (slandered the one that saw through his BS) and the female friends he has in his life that he has slept with... slept with... Red flag!

And I’m not mad at all to lose a non-friend. He pretended to be a friendly mutual friend just to gain access to me, but he wasn’t actually a friend. A real true friend would have not been phased AT ALL by the date not working, because they would have sensed the same thing as me, and liked me enough as a friend, to KEEP A FRIENDSHIP. If they don’t want to keep a friendship after one lame, pathetic, fake-date (not hypothetical, THIS IS MY ACTUAL SITUATION) that person was never a friend to begin with.

Furthermore, in general, suspected romantic feelings don’t entitle you to be an asshole to someone who hasn’t harmed you, all the romantic feelings do is bring out the lies that were originally placed. 

If you had an honest friendship to begin with, ROMANCE DOES NOT DISSOLVE THAT.

This is not some hypothetical “poor men!”. This is a real situation I clearly described and it has nothing to do with what you said. Fuck any guy that fakes being my friend just to fake date. That’s NOT A FRIEND. 

He didn’t actually like or respect me as a person at all. It was fake.

Let me repeat: ROMANTIC FEELINGS DO NOT ENTITLE YOU TO HARM ANOTHER PERSON."

I have heard this exact concept described before, many times, around anon forums for sociopathic, psychopathic, and general ASPD diagnosed people. There’s a lot of neuroscience to it.

TwoXChromosomes,fpgtmvk,t1_fpgfbgu,1588609297.0,"Yes, thank you!! 🙏🏼

 I’m proud of being polite. Why would I have been rude? We thought we might get along so we agreed to do a date. Why would I act any other way? As soon as the date was ending and he made a move, I declined and said we shouldn’t date further. Since we began as mutual friends, I said may as well continue as friends. Keep in mind this guy didn’t actually have feelings for me, he doesn’t even know me, because he spent all of his energy raving about other women instead of showing any interest in me as a person.

So to try to find some way to still blame me (OP) for how any of this went, means that person drank the Koolaid of blaming women for everything that happens to them, instead of holding a grown adult man accountable for his role. I stand by my politeness, I don’t want or need to be rude just to make a point. I gave him every kindness I’d show to a friend, and that’s something to be proud of."
TwoXChromosomes,fpgsupz,t1_fpgf4es,1588608891.0,"Same! Glad this resonated!

First we start casual, as friends. Then there is a (fleeting) mutual interest expressed, so we try a date. In the date the guy spends the entire time gushing about all his other female friends and exes. He shows he isn’t actually into me at all, he is only into his assumption that I am into him. This becomes unattractive to me, so after the date I politely say that we should just continue as friends, as we were. Suddenly, this is unacceptable, and he doesn’t want me in his harem of female friends and exes. Banished!

Ha."
