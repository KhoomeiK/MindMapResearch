trialsofmana,fqjb35g,t3_gj8n3w,1589407476.0,"I made 4 different parties of Riesz/Duran/Kevin in original and tbh they're the most potent melee fighters. I see Hawkeye more like a spellcaster. Duran's sabers are important to consider, for example in Kevin's story you're more likely to face undead monsters and need the holy saber.

So this compo may be fun, because you'd rely only on raw power and healing items, along with holy saber after the class change:

1. Kevin Fatal Fist
2. Duran Paladin
3. Riesz Vanadis

The strategy is a no brainer here, you buff your Kevin and Riesz and let them perform their AoE attacks all around.

Alternatively you can look into Duran's Swordmaster, which kinda works well in his own arc. What is nice is having the Magic Protect spell from Hawkeye in this same arc. So why not:

1. Duran Edelfrei
2. Hawkeye Nomad
3. Riesz Dragon Master

Here, Riesz can make proper use of her summon, poisoning enemies, and use debuff. You'd have to boost her strength for the melee power. Hawkeye just do his trap and tree magic stuff with full support IA.

One last with Charlotte that may be fun to practice, and relies a lot on magic:

1. Charlotte Warlock
2. Hawkeye Rogue
3. Angela Magus

The you'd profit from Rogue's traps, Warlock magic debuff and healing, and the Magus trickery about sacrificing HP to output more magical damage with spells. I like Charlotte's dark classes better than light personally.

Hope you enjoy those, cheers."

I quit my former job in 2017 and it brought me to a dark place. Even trying to rebuild myself by changing career was a hassle because studying while living at my mother's was a nightmare.

I don't like my job either. It's not really the job, more of the rule set (fixed amount of vacation, fixed time schedule, etc).

I, too, wish the world was more flexible to allow certain type of personalities to thrive. It just feels everyone is contracted to the same things. Even self-made men and entrepreneur still need to do accounting, reporting to state instances, and sales.

I do not see myself fit for selling myself, proving I am worth x or y salary, etc, but I do my best of it anyways.

At this point, both of the situations are intolerable for my mental health. The only way I cope is with some money I can put aside (financial stability) and offering myself treats such as vacations or restaurant.

They don't let me listen to a track without an account these fuckers."
antinatalism,fpx2z7u,t3_gfz624,1588974688.0,"I completely understand these comments. As much as antinatalism is of interest to me, I would never dare to make my coming-out.

I comment enough on the shit that's going on in the world to realise everybody around me do not give a flying fuck, even are annoyed by negative thoughts. Poor peers are trying to stay positive, and by being pessimistic, or let's call it realistic, you ruin their feelings of hope for the better.

This ""happiness"" culture turned most poople into zombies, which is unfortunate, but it is like it is.

I still hate to fakely congratulate all my pregnant friends. But I do it to stay cool with etiquette. Oh well call me a fricking coward you'd be right."
NEET,fpx2mt8,t3_gg2ask,1588974501.0,"I second it.

I work and I still hate it day-to-day, the only idea of having income not enough to do my shit right is terrifying.

I should have some sort of hippie epiphany and lose my possessions and go live in a temple in India, but that's really not my thing. I just want to keep the relative comfort I was allowed as a kid."
AskMen,fpx1dgo,t3_gfkwix,1588973821.0,"wow that's a high Enneagram 6 energy here, way to go! Well done with the bunsen burner.

Well, my anxiety superpower is my ability to have all my friends stopping to invite me for chats and events because I always get so serious by talking about the shit going on in the world, so yay me!"

conspiracy,fpx0v1p,t3_gfxfht,1588973545.0,"I'm so mad because I do want to do small acts of rebellion, but everything makes it a high risk. For example, in my country of residence, if you are caught wandering on the seaside or in a park during lockdown, then the police gets you a fine equivalent to 3/4 of the minimum wages. Way to deter people from trying to be the smater one. I hate it all and I hate myself for not having a big pair."
NetflixSexEducation,fpx0cbv,t3_gfx7qn,1588973268.0,"Honestly this story arc must be the most emotional I've found in this show. I've rooted for them at every single minute after the detention scene, and I'm not even gay myself. The show flawlessly made me connect to characters I do not identify to, and this is a powerful move. Since everyone is complaining here and there that there are not enough characters to identify to for everyone.

What connects is true emotion."
