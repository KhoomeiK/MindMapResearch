https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/herpes-simplex-virus

And for more in depth here's what it says about transmission:

HSV-1 is mainly transmitted by oral-to-oral contact to cause oral herpes infection, via contact with the HSV-1 virus in sores, saliva, and surfaces in or around the mouth. However, HSV-1 can also be transmitted to the genital area through oral-genital contact to cause genital herpes.

HSV-1 can be transmitted from oral or skin surfaces that appear normal and when there are no symptoms present. However, the greatest risk of transmission is when there are active sores.

Individuals who already have HSV-1 oral herpes infection are unlikely to be subsequently infected with HSV-1 in the genital area.

In rare circumstances, HSV-1 infection can be transmitted from a mother with genital HSV-1 infection to her infant during delivery.
HSV-2 is mainly transmitted during sex, through contact with genital surfaces, skin, sores or fluids of someone infected with the virus. HSV-2 can be transmitted from skin in the genital or anal area that looks normal and is often transmitted in the absence of symptoms.

In rare circumstances, HSV-2 infection can be transmitted from a mother to her infant during delivery."

So my freshman year of high school my old cat, who I had since I was 5, passed away. He'd been sick for a very long time and my parents refused to get him help as he was old. I came home one day to find he was gone. I won't get into details, but his passing wasn't due to his health.

At any rate I was a wreck, and it effected my sleep badly. I ended up sleeping on the couch a lot because I couldn't stand sleeping in my bed without him. One night I woke up and heard his little high pitched chirpy meow, and felt him rubbing his cheek against the side of my hand. I knew it was him because he was a long haired cat, and our others were all short hairs. 

I started petting him and heard him purring, and then he suddenly left. I sat up and looked down where he was and didn't see him. So not knowing what to do I called for him. He crawled slowly out from under the couch. He had a little bit of fur on his face, but the rest was all rotted meat and exposed bones. He looked up at me and meowed loudly, and rubbed my hand.

Now I wanted to scream. This was one of the most horrifying things I remember ever seeing, but I had this very heavy feeling that I could NOT reject him right now. So I just sat there on the couch and petted him. He jumped into my lap and I kept petting him, scratching his ears and chin, saying how much I loved him, crying my eyes out. He sat there purring and purring, kneading my legs with his toe bones. Eventually he bit my hand, like he always did when he had enough, jumped off and crawled back under the couch.

I went back to sleep, and when I woke up in the morning I wanted to write the whole thing off as sleep paralysis. Except I still had a perfect little bite mark on my hand, in the shape of his mouth."
