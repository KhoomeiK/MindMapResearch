This is all what the brain does to protect the person who experienced trauma. The person who experienced trauma may not think of themselves as the original, and most likely has no sense of self, but this is due to- once again- what the brain does with alters and disassociation."

To answer your original question, show a different angle that people with dissociative disorders often don't get portrayed in the media. Don't make switching a spectacle to be gawked. Don't make it violent. Do show every day difficulty. Do show little humorous moments. Write the character to be HUMAN.

I moved out of my abusers' house at 18. It was a priority (pets included). That being said, I understand everyone's situational details vary. What doesn't vary is this: No matter how unstable your mother is, no matter what she may do, it is not your fault. She doesn't own ANY piece of you. 

It's clear you're intelligent and probably already know this, but it's so very true. With that in mind, decide a long term goal, and then some short term goals. A short term goal might be finding a place for your pets (In my case, I befriended a pet store employee and he graciously took in my pet.).

The long term goal might be what you desperately need, but are too scared and worried to follow through. There are ways, and there are options. There were many points I didn't believe this and heavily self sabotaged myself... In addition, once you are out, once you are safe... It's quite frankly mind bending... I've only been away from my abusers a year and the differences in my emotional and physical health are ASTOUNDING. You see things differently. You become different- positively and negatively. I can't fully describe how truly amazing and real that new reality becomes- but it is completely necessary.

The scary thing is you have to make that step.. You have to make those plans and stand by them. You have to fight for your life. I believe in you, and I apologise if my post rambled or I sounded pretentious. Feel free to DM me. Good luck ‚ù§Ô∏è"

unpopularopinion,exdfuml,t1_emfxlew,1566175529.0,"I think the movie is extremely well done and entertaining. There are trains now with large aquarians; it's not very far fetched, especially when the whole premise is a self sustaining train. 

Weapon proficient kindergarten teacher? It's not like she already had a gun. She was aware and familiar with the government train proceedings and had an esteemed position in charge of the upper classes' children. 
Knowing how to use a gun, especially in an important job position, doesn't seem very far fetched. I enjoyed her character especially because of how slightly insane she was through the entire scene. 

It's been confirmed that the ""psychic"" wasn't psychic. Children born and raised on the train are more sensitive to vibrations, movements and sounds. The back section of the train kids had little to none of this sensitivity because of how crowded and noisy their environment was. Yona, however, spent her life in the upper section and the prison section with little noise and disturbance.

Bullet fight through the glass at that distance is also possible. At the beginning of the scene, one of the guards tries to stop the hit man. He says something like, ""Gun regulations. Stop shooting. Minimize damage."" They also show a guard plugging up the bullet holes... Of course the hit man doesn't listen and breaks regulation. The point is his actions were outside of what was allowed, and the writers made a point to show that as well as how the guards dealt with bullet holes until the glass was replaced.

The ""Middle Aged Banker Hit Man"" is a smart detail for observant movie goers. Wilfred dropped hints at how the tail and the front work together, how many things are staged within the system, and how Gilliam was working with Wilfred. The Hit Man was working for Wilfred to make sure things stayed in place. He made sure the revolt didn't get too far, and he killed Gilliam on Wilfred's orders. 

Lastly, I'm pretty sure anyone's instinctual reaction to finding out you've been eating roaches is going to range from distaste to disgust. All Curtis had eaten were those bars for almost 20 years. The dialogue (multiple times) made a point to emphasize how disgusting the bars tasted... I'm not sure how NOT enjoying Roach for dinner equates to being a plot hole."

I can only imagine in the future how your display of emotion can encourage other boys who feel the need to suppress. Don't change yourself! That being said, if you feel as if your emotions are too extreme, (which is unhealthy for anyone) I'd recommend becoming aware of triggers or moments that lead into the episode.

I understand completely what you mean about being 'pushed back slightly.' It's like looking out a window. If the window is really foggy and tightly latched, you can't see and reach your friend (alter) outside. If the window is clear and open, you can't physically reach your friend, but you can see what they're doing. I hope that makes sense, LOL."

And, from the beginning, my boyfriend even told me he didn't want any sexual/romantic relationships with my alters because they're different people. They're not me, I'm not in control, I'm not aware. That's to say, if you like the idea and you YOURSELF can benefit from an open relationship with your alters, go for it. If it's just to make them happy, red flag. If you choose to set those boundaries, it may help explaining to your partner further how they aren't you, and, like you said, you're not in control."
