Countryside - BEAUTIFUL. The scenery, the activities, the walks, the fresh air... the feeling that you escape work and all of a sudden you’re in the most amazing landscape and you’re cut off from the smog and stress of paid employment. You just feel free. However, you need transport of some kind to get anywhere. Unreliable public transport (I grew up in the middle of Scotland and it was worse here in the south of England!), difficulties when the weather turns (although the tiny amount of snow we have down here gives you a hell of an excuse to stay home, also if you need to get out of unwanted social events! But if you hate snow... well, UGH SNOW.) the hayfever, the animals - cows, pigs escaping, horses escaping fields etc (it happens more than I ever expected it would!). You also feel secluded in terms of feeling safe - as you’re in the middle of nowhere it means the police, fire service, ambulance take longer to get to you if the worst happens. You’re also reliant on the internet and contact to stay in touch with people which isn’t necessarily hard providing you have reliable internet. Also the smell of farming... it’s pungent. 

Suburbs - we bought a house to upsize for the impending wedding / settle down / have a family. We could NOT have afforded a house this size (3 bed plus garage etc) where we were. We downgraded in terms of postcode (I guess?) to afford the biggest and best priced place we could get but that is also in a town that we know well. Although our new house is three times the size of our old house it’s definitely progress despite not looking out of my window and seeing miles of rolling hills. But that’s compromise, this will be our home for many years - I can jump on the train and get to work, cutting my fuel and parking bills. I am nearer to friends and family, we now have secure off street parking which isn’t just a field... I believe it’s all about convenience and at the stage of our lives that we are currently at, thats more important. FYI, our internet speeds were better in the country - we haven’t got a hope in hell of getting fibre where we are, it’s too in demand. I miss it!

In the UK, crime scene photographs form part of the case and are not released publicly due to Data Protection laws, welfare and decency reasons. It’s rare that crime scene photographs are released but when they are, it’s for a reason.

On a lot of cases (particularly recent ones) you won’t find a level of detail that you might do in cases from overseas. This is due to UK Law.

The press also have reporting restrictions placed on them by the Crown Prosecution Service in certain cases and after an offender is charged there is only so much that they’re allowed to report.

A lot of the time the only way you’ll find out information is when it’s been leaked by unscrupulous types, the press, family etc. 

It’s for this reason that to this day, not much is known about the story behind the Moors Murders, White House Farm murders, Fred and Rose West etc.

You could try searching online via a proxy server as there is a lot of press info in the UL (national and local newspapers) regarding this case, check out ‘Sarah’s Law’ and West Sussex Police’s website as there is some info on there."
