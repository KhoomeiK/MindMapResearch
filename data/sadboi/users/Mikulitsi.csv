It was actually an option in game like in F1 2015 and 2016 and then it was taken off from game :( Still it's in the dynamic weather but it's rare to get it.

Loved the fighting scenes but I'm still wondering if that was the real escape gate which we saw at the end of the episode or why couldn't that man escape before the horror came and ate that man.
