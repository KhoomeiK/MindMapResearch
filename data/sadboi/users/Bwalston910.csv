Sometimes they challenge each other for the longest inhales and biggest puffs, then it gets worse like instead of mtl just straight to lung.

CrappyDesign,fpsipie,t1_fpsfzzm,1588874137.0,Nicotine gum and patches are better imo.
CrappyDesign,fpsikoq,t1_fpsg8re,1588874074.0,"Yeah the metal particles that come from the heating coils, poorly designed heating systems that draw too much from the batteries or heat them theirselves, the amount of nicotine in a single 6m ml tank, and the chemicals that are used in the fluid as well as what they break down into are toxic and have a high change of causing lung problems. It may not cause cancer (which isn't proven iirc), but is it really worth it as an alternative other than patches or gum? Idk. Overall Boone should take it up as hobby or not. If you just like the sensory smell use a diffuse and essential oils. Of course this is only what I know from my class and some quick internet research."
