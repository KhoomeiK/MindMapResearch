FP is more a nickname terminology for the unhealthy standards we apply to said relationships with people, which hold reference to very real and documented symptoms of BPD.

Frequent valuation and devaluation (unrelenting standards and a mix of others)
Idealised image and concept of other (also unrelenting standards)
Testing and confirming loyalty (abandonment/mistrust)

gaming,ets5cw4,t1_etrxro1,1563136925.0,I believe it's coming to Switch and Steam! Although it will be available on Steam early access much sooner than the switch release!
gaming,etqpe0x,t1_etpqvkn,1563096236.0,The tags are there so you can identify a post and decide if you want to read the comments.
gaming,etpqkqa,t1_etpnnj2,1563062185.0,Vent tags are designed so that people can vent no matter the triviality.
gaming,etpn9ha,t1_etpn2as,1563059863.0,"I mean people did notice, that's why they're there. Most the posts you mentioned are tagged with venting on them, so if you don't want to see it it's super easy to avoid."
gaming,etpmxtq,t1_etpmkw8,1563059631.0,In the comments yeah but the posts themselves funny.
gaming,etpmdvy,t3_ccrfck,1563059236.0,"To be fair I think for the most part it's a joke on the whole cutting Pokémon for HQ animations.

Didn't really seem the sub was being that serious tbf, sure there's gonna be some intense commenters but I'd rather carry on enjoy the animation memes.

Seeing a Chinese bootleg with more personalized animations than the real game was funny."
gaming,etpm0pp,t1_etp9du8,1563058973.0,Yeah but you're ignorant of the fact that new HQ animations were the official reason for dexit.
gaming,etplqzk,t1_etoyiux,1563058782.0,Saaaaame!
pokemon,etmmsiu,t1_etm6sh7,1562963525.0,"I mean it does matter because if they were to become the majority shareholder Nintendo then has a say over how the company functions and if Nintendo eventually ended up owning the company via agreement over financial issues or whatever then they would effectively become a 1st party developer for Nintendo.

TPC is a bridge company between the original investors but it does make it's own money and a percentage of that money is given to Nintendo, Game Freak and but on a lesser amount Creatures, it does keep some revenue for itself otherwise it wouldn't be it's own company it would be a branch. I also don't believe GF get royalties for Pokemon appearances/merch as said Nintendo own the trademark not GF.

While it's certainly not feasible that GF would go under due to the failure of one game, if this repeats eventually it would meet shortcomings, the protest with SS needs to prove that they can not afford not to improve themselves.

The financial successes of the past will definitively support them but then that also brings into question that if GF really do have so much money than why is the quality of the games so god damn poor. Why are they still so limited in their number of staff, how are the other less financially successful franchises at such a higher standard, so many questions that honestly make me doubt the financial stability of GF especially when it's something so unreported despite the success and fame of the franchise."
pokemon,etl3nko,t1_etkfv7b,1562919914.0,"The thing is no one is sure of how much those specific companies own but Nintendo and Creatures both own shares of GF, and what creatures used to make now goes to TPC, so GF is still in the pockets of their partners.

Of the Pokémon IP Nintendo only owns the Trademark. That's literally just the names. Creatures owns the right to develope the card game while Game Freak owns the right to develope the games."
pokemon,etl2zet,t1_etknu0a,1562918976.0,"It's still run independently, it's was only formed to manage the brand and publish it 50/50 with Nintendo, things just as merch/anime it's also more complicated than a 33% cut across the board.

Nintendo own the majority, creatures are responsible for the development of the TCG and GF are responsible for main series game development. The TPC manages the franchise shared by these companies."
pokemon,etkg4bo,t1_etkdqrs,1562897107.0,"I've read similar comments, however all reports about GF and Nintendo's relationship suggest otherwise, that Nintendo have never pressured GF.

I personally don't see TPC or Nintendo as villains in this scenario, what has happened has been because of GF's negligence and lack of ability to produce a game to the standard the industry and community expects of a £/$/€60 game.

Their excuses have all been proven to simply save face and hold no explanation as to why the game's development has clearly proposed such a challenge.

Emphasis on the ""if"" in my statement regarding the downfall of GF. Personally I would love Nintendo to outright buy the IP and give it the quality assurance it's in dire need of."
