What helped was beginning to incorporate more fats...it was super hard, especially at first, because fats are my biggest fear food. But they make this SO much more manageable because of how dense they are.

I made a goal with my dietitian to increase my calories by a manageable amount every week, and then I started adding in calorie-dense fats back into my diet little by little. For example, one week, I added 2 tbsp of peanut butter to my oatmeal every morning. The next week, I started cooking my vegetables in oil on top of that. This week, I added in dense spreads...hummus, cream cheese, etc. on top of that. Hope this helps a little bit!"

For the record though, any normal person who says they go days without eating is either (a) full of shit, or (b) mentally ill themselves.

This is a really big deal...diabulimia is very dangerous. I am in recovery from diabulimia, and when I was sick, I really hurt my body. Going into DKA, which is what happens when you don't take insulin, can be fatal. Chronic high blood sugars also raise your risk for every diabetic complication there is.

Unfortunately, eating disorder recovery is a choice that nobody can make for her, but you can let her know that you are concerned about her behaviors and just want her to be safe and healthy. I highly recommend giving her the number for the diabulimia helpline: (425) 985-3635. They will answer 24/7 and talk with her, and they can recommend resources and treatment. They were incredibly helpful when I was searching for a treatment center to help get me on the path to recovery.

Please let me know if you have any questions. This is a hard and often misunderstood illness, and it can be scary. Take care <3"

I have struggled with diabulimia in the past, which is when type 1 diabetics witthold insulin to lose weight. It causes rapid weight loss, but obviously, comes with a host of complications. In the short-term, a lot of people with this disorder are hospitalized for DKA.

As a teenager, I was told by a doctor in the ER that I didn't have a ""real"" eating disorder--I was just crazy and needed to be sent off to a general psych ward for a few months. That hurt.

I think it's so important to be aware of the different manifestations of eating disorders, and above all else, listen to your patients. They are experts on their own lives, and a lot of the time, they just want help."
