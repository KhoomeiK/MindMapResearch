I have to say, of course, that I also have a history of ADD and always had focus, memory and energy problems throughout life, starting in high school. So the finils are therapeutic for me, not nootropic and not recreational."

berlin,fbdh6wr,t1_fbdd5a7,1576762052.0,"It is so crazy how a significant amount of people really thinks like this...   


I would really rather see Berlin turning into Vienna than San Fran. Vienna has an amazing social housing system with quite low rents making it possible for people of different social backgrounds to live together in decent neighbourhoods. This system is a true great idea for the future of humanity.  


I fail to understand how some people perceive the concentration of wealth and political power to the hands of a few tech-bosses as a positive thing for a city or even for humanity. San Francisco is a divided city. If you do not belong to the higher classes, you do not belong to the city. So, yes, economic growth, but to whom? And what exactly are important companies? What do they do that is so important? Would they help Berlin in tackling its problems, such as creating affordable housing for all, or tackling homelessness and poverty? Was this the case in San Francisco? Or has the city only became rich for the few? Berlin is not living with other people's money... we are all Germans, or Europeans if you would like. If each city or state should be responsible for its own revenues there would be no sense in having a federal union or even a supranational union as the European Union. Berlin administers the Federal Republic politically and has to have the resources for doing so - and it should not be corrupted with dirty money from immorally powerful actors from tech companies. Also, do not forget that Germany is the country profiting the most of a unified market in the European Union. So could we say that Germany is living from other people's money for decades as well?"

All I can do is learn to live with it and try to deal with the attacks as they come. Sports, fuck it mentality/meditation, no alcohol and drugs, healthy and tasty food, all of these help me control it, but I guess there is no magic substance to cure it. My experience with bacopa, ash, l teanine, nac, cbd, l tyrosine, taurine 5htp, lavender oils, and even with stronger shit such as ssris, benzos and phenibut is that they help for a while until they make it worse and the side effects are greater than the positive ones.

My anxiety is unbearable both on a daily basis and when I have the attacks, but I guess what is helping is to fucking accepting that I will have it for my whole life and try to control a bit the basics in my brain through good food, relationships and sport. We kind of die a bit on the inside after realizing it can't be cured, but we die in order to learn to live with it. And yes I've done therapy for many years as well.

I hope my experience might help you, even though it sounds kind of negative, but it ain't, it's just raw and real.

I started with benzos so I would be able to quit other stronger drugs that I abused for about 4 or 5 years on weekends and partying. So, I kind of replaced their use and the use of alcohol with occasional benzo use. The last step will be the wd now. Thanks a lot for all the information!"
