Call a trusted family member or friend to go with you for support if possible, and to stay with after you‚Äôre done. Even though it wasn‚Äôt immediately after, you want the documentation. 

There are resources available, especially through places like [RAINN](www.rainn.org), to help you get through this. Please don‚Äôt worry about his feelings or what happens to him. Just get out and prioritize your safety. Whatever you do with your rape kit results, such as pressing charges or anything, doesn‚Äôt have to be decided on yet. You can just get it done, file a police report, and go from there. Trust me, I‚Äôve spent the last 11 years wishing I had done this, so that at least I had the option when I was raped.
