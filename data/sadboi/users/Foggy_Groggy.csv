Well, then you don't have Autism.""  


Fast forward 2 yrs or so, to the adult psychiatry. I bring it up again to my doc, I'm finally taken seriously. Sent to a good psychiatrist, hospitalized and analyzed for 3 weeks, gone through all the tests etc. And then I get my answer. I have Asperger. Aka, high functioning autism.  


Same with my depression and anxiety, been suicidal and self harming for years, brought it up, got diagnosed.

And now, finally my bulimia, which also I brought up. Suppose, purging 2-7 times a day is a pretty clear sign of a problem, and its not necessarily easy to figure out, if you don't count weight loss etc. Which I'm currently in hospital for now.

Im tired of living a life being miserable, and feeling sorry for myself. Yeah. I have a lot of mental, physical and chronic problems. Experienced a lot of trauma, and losses of loved ones. Some of my problems I can work on improving. And some I just have to accept.

But. With a lot of hard life lessons. And taking a lot of wisdom from buddhism as well. I've more or less found peace and learn to appreciate what I still do have, because I know how fast that too can be ripped out of my hands. My small, broken family, means everything to me now, ans that I found, is my purpose in life. As long as they're happy, and we have eachother, nothing else rly matters. 

I've accepted what isnt meant for me. Happiness isnt necessary having a good job. Or a partner. Or being healthy. And it isnt the short feeling you feel when buying something nice, or doing something fun.

Its just, a state of mind, when you have made peace with your past, and stop worrying about the future. Change what you can change in life, and what you can not change, accept it as it is. 

I cant rly help you out of your situation, since it is your journey. Not long ago, I'd probabmy be angry by my own message, if it came from someone else. Because, nobody knows your journey as well as you do. All I suppose I can do. Is to share my life lessons, and how I've found comfort in my situation, and in a way, peace and happiness.

One day talking to my aunt about having been depressed for years, and then my aunt opens up about her anxiety. The half cousin is like ""oh, anxiety? I've never had that before"" 

One week later and she posts on her blog that she even links to to her public FB that she's had anxiety her whole life.

A couple of months later get permanent disability financial support granted, she and her ""anxiety"" sitting home being one of those slutty twitch streamers now. Getting financial support someone else who actually have problems needs more than her lazy attention-seeking ass needs lol.

I'm not gonna go into more details but she does A LOT of provocative shit to make people feel bad for her., including things that affects others, and her family negatively."

Im going into inpatient over new years to get help to get back on my feet. And then I just want to close this 20 yr old chapter with a living hell. And get a life. I'll focus on the small things that gives me meaning. My family especially.

I hope you find your own purpose too if you haven't already. We can't choose our battles always. But, finding peace with the problems I have. And accept that I'll have to live with many of them, has given me a sense of peace.

I dont want to go around feeling sorry for myself and greave for what i lost and what I went through anymore. I've learned how fragive life is. And how easily something you love can be ripped out of your hands.

It would be a shame if I were to waste any more years on greiving, being depressed, and sick, instead of cherishing the little rest of a family and purpose I have left in life.

I'll take my wisdom with me, and make the most out of what I have, while I still have it.

I wish you the best of luck as well, and that you'll find your own purpose.

Happiness isnt the temporary feeling of joy you get when buying something nice, or doing something fun. 
Its a state of mind, when you make peace with your past, stop worrying about the future, and live life in the now, and cherish, and love and appreciate what you have, as well as accept and let go of what you dont have. 
Stop comparing your life to others, because one, you dont know their journey, and 2, we all have our strengths and weaknessess, and as long as you live the best life you can, and be as best of a human as possible to the abilities you have in life, then you'll be just as successfull in your own journey.

Success isnt about having a good job and lots of money. Success is whatever is important for you. Weather it is photography, painting, music, family, animals or just, helping others."

Buddhism,f4mz0ur,t3_dl3aoo,1571683947.0,">1. Do you personally believe in a God/higher being? What do you call them? What are their attributes/makes you want to serve them?

No. Not in a god or a creator. I do believe in spirits, that theres multiple astral realms or dimentions. Non physical dimentions of diffrent vibrations though.

>2. What drew you do Buddhism/convinced you to become a follower?

I grew up in a non-religious christian family. Life has just been one hard mess after the other. And no matter how much praying I did. There was never a sign of a god or any god.
Praying to a god never solved any of my problems, but as I've learned later, to accept and live with it has helped me a lot more on an emotional level.
I was an atheist for my majority of childhood and my teenager years.
I inherited sleep paralysis, and eventyally had a few astral projection experiences after my dad, and grandpa passed away. Visits etc. Which made me look up buddhism and find quite a few similarities.
Not only that, but their view on life in general is very appealing to me.
Im still pretty new at buddhism. I dont know any buddhists, its not common qhere I live. And I've never had the chance to speak to a monk or another buddhist. But would love to if I got the oppertunity. 
In other words. Im not an expert. I dont know everything. Im not super religious, and some of my beleifs may be a mix of buddhism and things I've experienced while astral projecting, and theorizing on my own.

>3. What do you personally believe happens to people after they die? If so, what determines what happens to them in the next life?

What I've experienced while astral projecting. Is seing my beloved dad, and grandfather. The whole aura of the enviroment and them was just bright. And calmness. And peace. And extreme love. Its feelings I've never experienced in life before.

I've experienced the opposite as well. Darker or lover vibrating spirits. But not letting myself get affected by them, makes that rare occurances.

I know theres multiple planes. Or astral planes. Or dimentions or life after death. Theres also a lot of proof of people being re-born. Very few cases they remember some of their previous life.
Personally, speaking for myself. I think its a choice. Maybe you have unfinished buisness. Maybe you regretted something in your previous life. Maybe you want to make up for something. 

I think life is about living the best life you can, with what you have. So you dont have regrets when you die. And then, finally, maybe you dont feel the need to live again.

Or maybe, the spirit life is just plain boring in the long run. Who knows haha.
I could probably theorize for hours haha.

>4. Where do you worship? If there is not a temple nearby, do you worship at home or with a group of other followers?

As previously mentioned. Im not very religious. Theres no temple nearby and I dont know any other buddhists.
I dont rly celebrate any buddhist holidays. I do celebrate christmas, because as mentioned; I grew up in a non-religious christian family. So x-mas for me is more of a family gathering holiday than anything religious.

If ever I were to get to know someone who has more experience with buddhism, I'd love to have a deep conversation about it, and learn more, and maybe even participate in some things.

But for now, I'm just living my life as good as it lets me.

>5. How would you define your purpose in life as a follower of Buddhism?

Be kind and respectful to everyone. Dont intentionally harm anyone or anything. Live the life as good as it lets you to your abilities. Be open minded. Try to see things from diffrent perspectives, and not judge someone. We're all so much more similar than a lot of people think.
Constantly try to improve yourself as a human being. Everyone makes mistakes, but its important to see it, and learn from it, and grow.
And, lastly, as someone with A LOT of mental, developmental, social and physical chronic problems. Try to see that, this is just how it is. And accept it. And try to find happiness in the small things and in my family and close ones.

>6. What does worship look like for you? Are you allowed to talk/pray directly to your god?

Theres no god in buddhism. And not everyone pray. If they do then its pretty induvidual.
I guess some pray to buddha for guidance. Remember. Buddha isnt a god. He never claims to be a god or a higher being. He was just a man. A man that gave up everything. To find the meaning of life, and happiness. And guide others on the right path.

Personally. The closest I get to praying is to my dad, or my grandpa. Idk if I'd call it praying. Maybe kind of talking to them. Pretty much asking for thr same thing. Guidance. Help. A push in the right direction.
Idk. Maybe they can somehow mentally influence me in a way?

>7. What convinced you that Buddhism is true/the only path to follow?

As mentioned over. It started with my experiences with astral projection. And then the journey found its way. For me, this is what I believe and what speaks to me the most with how we look at life and people, and god.
But the only path to follow? No. I absolutely dont think so. Its not like, if u dont believe in god u go to hell kind of thing.

Its in a way not really a religion in that sence.

I read an interview with a monk once where he said that. As long as you live life as good as you can, to your abilities and beleifs, and dont harm others, you'll be good. Every religion has similarities, and its all connected in a way.

My point is. If you believe in god/ Jehovah. Or Allah. Or who ever. It doesnt really matter. As long as it gives you a purpose in life, safety, guidance, and again, (not including extremists who kill people etc) as long as you're a genuinely good person. And do good deeds. In the end it doesnt matter too much.

>9. What are your honest personal opinions of people who follow Allah and of people who follow Jesus? (Not referring to extremists!)

I basically already answered that in the previous question haha

>10. Do you believe your god loves you? Why or why not?

Again. We dont believe in a god in buddhism.
I do believe my dead loved ones love me, as they have said when they visited me. I guess thats the closest. And hopefully we'll be together again in the afterlife, with no regrets."
