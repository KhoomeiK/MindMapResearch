NarcissisticAbuse,fquckls,t3_gkxqo7,1589656350.0,"I can totally relate and understand how hard it was to get out of this situation, I was fortunate to have done so after 9 months but the thoughts still cross my mind from time to time. I believe that this does make us stronger, and like to look at it from a positive perspective that I was willing to make myself vulnerable in trying my best to love. In the end, it is better to love and lost then never love at all. Hope this helps. I’m rooting die you. 🤗💜🦋"
LifeAfterNarcissism,fp7h9g6,t3_gbply3,1588370590.0,"Thank you 🙏🏼 I still need to get out this abusive situation with family. To be honest I ended moving back after breaking up with my ex because of faith differences and now I see it was a bad idea because they are always making me guilty about the decisions, but now I see things differently. You know you were in a good relationship when your ex saves the screen shots of the text messages as proof indicating you are a threat. I feel the need to do the right thing and take this to a professional to help me get out of this situation I put myself back on. That’s why I go running to release all this stress tension. Prayers appreciated."

NarcissisticAbuse,fo5md0f,t3_g5gqb4,1587529277.0,"Omg yes, this is what I’m struggling with, no one will really understand our story better than the way we tell it. When someone plays tricks on your mind making you believe they actually loved you and showed it in the works and then when we break up by way of too many differences (one big one was the way we practice our faith - there were too many disagreements in raising a family) and he shows you a different character. I just feel he wasn’t able to handle me at my worst - emotional self because of my eating disorder and the fact the I struggle with anxiety from being disconnected from my family or not seeing them as much but he never actually made the effort to encourage me but instead discouraged me saying they are the ones that are draining me. That certainty plays with your mind to make one believe they are but it’s important to remember no family is perfect, we may have disagreements and tension may arise but we are still family no matter what. I feel like this is why my mind often wonders far into my imagination and causing me great shame. Then I go for a run 🏃🏻‍♀️and that helps ease my anxiety and also makes me hungry so I use MyFittnessPal to monitor that I’m getting the right nutrients from calories without overindulging. I feel everyone should be a writer because there’s so much we can learn from each other."
EatingDisorders,flcc1ul,t1_flc91ce,1585025690.0,"I track my calories and what I eat on that app and it helps me not overeat and also be more mindful as to plan ahead like for example, if I’m hungry I’ll give myself options and then look on the app to see what’s missing. For instance if I haven’t had enough protein I’ll have a scoop of powder powder and if that’s not enough add something light like popcorn especially late at night. But I also struggle with an eating disorder if I’m short 100 calories, it’s really easy to consume with just a scoop of peanut butter but I still have that fear because of the fat content. Just throwing it out there, it’s not easy to live with, I know."
EatingDisorders,fjno34n,t3_fef14l,1583511340.0,"I do the same and use My Fitness Pal app to keep track of what I consume and how much I burn in exercise, ever since I ate one bad meal from the McDonald’s breakfast menu and feeling guilty about it afterwards. Then I was getting comments from my coworkers saying, McDonald’s is bad and that made me feel even worst so using this app puts me in control of what I eat throughout the day combined with exercise, cardio and weights."

eatingdisorderstories,fjnkh67,t3_fed9vr,1583509310.0,"I think this is a great topic to discuss to spread awareness. This will help others in their journey as well as identify the different triggers that cause us to relapse and how to overcome it. I was diagnosed at a young age, but didn’t become aware of the different factors that triggered it until now and now am taking baby steps to progress. Remember everyone is different, slow and steady progress breeds results. It’s also important to note that recovery from an eating disorder isn’t easy, and not anyone can share your story but YOU. Best of luck and please share your channel on here, I will subscribe to it and share with others."

LifeAfterNarcissism,fjk9t21,t3_f1e4te,1583423089.0,"I can relate, it’s been a little a month after my breakup and still continue to have these weak moments when I see the toxic behavior revealed to me at odd moments, it’s important to remember healing is a process, and time is different for everyone. There will be good days, just stay hopeful."
EatingDisorders,fjid1m8,t3_fdi5d8,1583365017.0,"I can totally relate, being that I am a college student working full time and just went through a breakup, even though it’s been a month healing is a process. I’ve been going through so many changes and they are overwhelming, it’s got to the point where I am constantly tired and weak can’t focus at work or school, this isn’t like me. I’ll turn to protein bars and shakes, as well as, coffee to give me energy, it works but only a few hours before the crash and I feel like I haven’t slept in forever."
eatingdisorderstories,fjiaysk,t3_fa1dq2,1583363794.0,"I can relate, my doctor recommended me to be hospitalized because of my BMI being severely low, but for me the thought is scary. I like to be in control of what i consume, and I get emotional at the thought of being hospitalized under someone else’s care. At the same time, I feel that I will benefit because as hard as I’m trying to eat small meals throughout the day, my energy level is still not where I want it to be to get through the day and may be because of my low BMI level which is really serious. Being in grad school and working full time, I feel like the demands of work and school are weighing heavier on me and I can’t seem to keep up and so I’ll workout with the mentality that it’s going to give me the energy but the opposite happens. My doctor wants to talk to my therapist if there are other options for me."
EatingDisorders,fji9xxy,t3_fbhcba,1583363189.0,"Omg I can totally relate in a similar way, but it’s not about my parents, but my aunt and grandma who are constantly preoccupied in constantly checking in on me what time I’ll be home and it makes me stressed. This is partially the reason why I moved out, as hard as living in a student apartment was that is 30 minutes from home, at the same time, it’s also allows me to focus on myself and well-being especially on nights when I get out late from work and want to hit the gym after work and actually have time to prepare my meals and focus on my school work. No one said moving out would be easy, especially graduate school but it’s necessary when you have family members always on your case, no offense, I respect them dearly but I’m doing the best I can in trying to become a better person. Hope this helps, the struggle is real, we’re in this together. I even had thoughts about moving back in with my family, but they took as it was a sudden move and I only did it to rebel against them. My boyfriend broke up with me after 9 months because it was emotionally stressful, aside from the fact that we had too many differences, now the question remains should I move back or how do I tell my family to respect my privacy and not to worry? This is just physically draining."
EatingDisorderHope,fji8dta,t3_fd4zmo,1583362351.0,"I feel like I just never have time to eat but a friend pointed out to me that can be a trigger, because the reality is our mind plays tricks on us into believing that there isn’t enough time, but really all it takes is 5 minutes to prepare a simple meal like scrambled eggs in the microwave topped off with a dash of salt and pepper. It’s just about changing prices mindset into seeing food as fuel for our bodies and knowing it’s going to replenish our tired bodies after a workout. Hope this helps."
