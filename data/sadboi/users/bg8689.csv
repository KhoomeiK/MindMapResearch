BipolarSOs,f7evj5q,t1_f78ogj3,1573666736.0,"Thank you for your comment. Yes, I do that a lot and keep telling myself I don't care about my SO anyway but I really do care so much and I'm so scared of messing it up. And then the head gets fuzzy and just ending it seems like the only solution.I apologized to him for my shitty behaviour with no excuses at all this time."
Anxiety,f7elb1j,t3_dvqeh7,1573660249.0,How long have u been with ur boyfriend? I got them in early stages of our relationship. Now I just make sure if he's still alive when he hasn't text back for long interval. But maybe I'm not anxious cos my siblings are shit texters. They hardly respond cos they prefer face to face talking.
BipolarSOs,f77p2bn,t1_f77g6lf,1573468779.0,Thank you for the comments. I'll acknowledge to him that I behaved badly.
Anxiety,f6rq204,t3_dsmchq,1573115061.0,Congratsss. I get so stressed about going through airports that I would get into very depressive state a few days before travelling. So I'm genuinely happy for u.
BipolarSOs,f6l2911,t3_drm6hc,1572926850.0,"Female/33 here and use to love sex till I took the meds. My sex drive was non existent. I do make an effort but it was hard for my SO. The worse part was in my head, I was annoyed at my SO for needing sex, I was hating sex, finding it demeaning( just the idea of being naked).Gosh I had to regulate my thoughts.It is getting better but I really have to make an effort to get myself excited for it again because the desire don't come naturally anymore for me. But it was better than the crazy sex life but hellish behaviours without meds."
Anxiety,f6dwebe,t3_dqy0ce,1572797597.0,"I'm in the same situation (same age too)but if I let the thoughts of what I could've done, I'll be back to lying in bed and smell of sloth and decay. There are days when I lay in bed instead of doing what I need to do. But I tell myself just waking up and getting out of bed alone is good enough for me. And I've been acheiving things faster now because those wasted years gave me certain insight. Like now that I've no ego of what I should be, I am excelling in the subject which I failed horribly 12 years before.So it's not that bad i think. :)"
MakeupRehab,f5vsl3s,t3_dp61hw,1572498446.0,"I had a colleague who loves to dress up. She was stationed in a run down shopping mall but her blue liner and bright lipstick really lighten up the place. One of my male colleagues was bitching about her wearing makeup and that she wasn't natural like me. I told him to f off and that I was wearing foundation, eyebrow pencil, eyebrow gel and lip balm!"
BipolarReddit,f5vrtza,t3_dpedf3,1572497647.0,I have one therapist who was a great fit for me when I was in an extremely bad state. But she wasn't suitable for me anymore after I became better but not competely out of it and was trying not to get into a limbo state. So I had to part with her.I felt bad but it's nothing personal.We weren't just suitable anymore.
MakeupRehab,f5991cb,t3_dn9lty,1572077221.0,My grandma always got mocked cos she likes full face makeup and women around her believe you should stop dressing up once u are married. She gives no hoot and looks great.
bipolar,f54gngq,t1_f51ross,1571981622.0,"Unlike my other exes, my SO has a clear set of boundaries and respect for himself. So I understood that mania or no mania, he'll definitely walk away if I was being assholish to him. That's why I only broke up with him when I'm completely not in control of myself and he understood that it came out from a really really bad episode. I started taking medication and then always keep track of my racing thoughts and inform my SO beforehand when I can feel I'm gonna go through a bad episode."
bipolar,f51l1f4,t1_f50vldt,1571942061.0,"Heya, it took me a long time to realise I was being self destructive and hurting my own chance of happiness with my partner. Even now, I still have thoughts like being in a relationship is so damn hard and troublesome and that my bf is a pest that is weighing me down."
bipolar,f4hf61r,t3_dkh9j8,1571590909.0,"I was just thinking yesterday that if I've my life flashes in front of me, it would be the bedroom walls. However, I just tell myself that I've more better memories as years go by. Slow improvement but better than no improvement!"
bipolar,f4he9g2,t3_dkioo1,1571590632.0,"That's me. With my ex, I broke up with him like every 2 days. With my SO, I knew it would start again so I seeked medical help and keeps track of my mood. I broke up with him 6 times in 4 years. Now when I've mania, he'll be like "" You are gonna break up with me right?'' which would piss me off cos that's what my head was telling me.
But what stopped me was that he joked abt breaking up one time and it really made me so sad and I realised how much of my action of saying ""Let's break up'' hurt to my parter.
I'm sorry you've to go through with this. But your bf needs to work on himself as well. I've bipolar and I work damn hard every day to not let this illness hurts the man I love."

BipolarReddit,f19q36h,t3_d88tnl,1569275963.0,"Not trying to one up.15 years of meds and excuses. Working freelance so that I can stay in bed some days in a week. 
But it's been so long that I kinda wanna beat it? Like I'm so used to it that I'm getting kind of bored of it. That's how I tell myself anyway. A lot of us are unfixable but we've come this far already. You've come this far. You fought everyday just to exist for 13 years. That's pretty awesome no? You are not alone. Big hugs to u."
