bipolar,ew08nix,t3_cm5vl2,1564979281.0,"This is as good of a place as any to ask for help, or vent. Having actual people to talk to, in the flesh, can be difficult. Besides yr therapist or psychologist of course. For me, it’s difficult because I find it’s hard for people to relate. Even those that are close to me. I find it’s kind of the reality of it sometimes, and I just try and surround myself with good listeners.

I can relate to how you don’t really talk about your problems until you know how to solve them, I do the same thing. I also tend to use humor to mask the pain, I mean I think even the normies can relate to that one lol. But, I can do it in unhealthy ways. Times where I should be serious I don’t. For me it comes down to a fear of being vulnerable. It’s why I want to have an idea of how to fix the issue before I vocalize anything. In some ways it’s helped me get through shit sometimes, but ya as a whole not really healthy behavior lol. 

Sounds like you’ve been through the ringer recently too, which always exasperates everything. Especially anything medication related. If I can give any type of advice it would be to call the doc even if you don’t have an appt if you explain the situation shouldn’t be a problem. Never has been for me at least."

It’s been tough lately though since I don’t always take care of myself very well, which makes me injury prone. Hence why I’m trying to be more intentional about getting out there and running drills, while also making sure I’m eating properly and all that jazz. Or just eating in general lol."

So essentially doesn’t matter until you pivot, and whichever foot yr pivoting with is now yr pivot until you throw?

I’ve run into this division a lot in the ultimate community in relation to physicality as of late. Seems like there are the purists who stick firm with the no contact rule and also dislike refs, and those who are fine with more contact (I’d even go as far to say want more physicality in the game) and think refs are a natural evolution to the game and speed up play so yr not bogged down with lengthy calls and contests.

I mean honestly, when I watch club games now observers are vastly becoming refs. No one really settles calls amongst themselves. I don’t think it’s necessarily possible, from a human nature perspective, for players to even be able to effectively do it at the highest competitive level. Refs are probably needed, instead of these quasi ref hybrids. This probably belongs more on a “hot take” thread, but there you have it. Thoughts?"
