houston,fl299oa,t3_fh1nwf,1584745797.0,My question is what do you do when you are non-essential but your company hasn't closed? Who do you call? How can you report your company?

Makeup,et3f7w5,t3_c9vbqb,1562432559.0,I use kiss lashes and the brush on glue. After you put on the glue wait for 60 seconds to get tacky. I always have to trim mine down. I wear them every day.
