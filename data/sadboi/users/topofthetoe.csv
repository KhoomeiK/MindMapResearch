MedicalAssistant,fpzjzuv,t1_fpyewhn,1589019303.0,"I started my 9 month course in November. We went into lockdown and my colleges first day online was March 23. I didn’t mind online school too much (My teacher struggled a lot at first as far as being organized and prepared. To be fair, no one expected the pandemic to happen, yet everyone adjusted well and it’s getting better with time). In class, we started learning about all the different specialties and each module we’d usually get labs, online, i don’t get the same experience. I have not done blood draws, testing hematocrit, glucose. I am missing out on learning EKGs, Throat Cultures, Applying and removal of casts, and a lot of other labs. I almost feel cheated, as if i’m not getting the hands on experience I paid for. ($17k course w/out financial aid at a private college). We do simtic simulations on occasion maybe once a week/every two weeks, but it’s almost a joke, some of the girls are on mobile devices so they can’t do it, i’m lucky i got a grant and a laptop was provided for me. I’m missing out on a lot. I’m on my last module before I start externship in mid june. I don’t know what will happen or how it will work, I think there was opportunity for an online type externship, but personally I wouldn’t want to do that. I wonder how the virus has impacted facilities and how much has changed/will change in the future. If I had to retake my course from scratch starting online, I wouldn’t want to do it. I enjoyed labs and class time offered me opportunities to ask questions i wouldn’t have thought of otherwise. I can’t speak for community colleges (mine is private and small and it’s great because my teachers can work with students one on one) but my private institution was great face to face, and okay online if you do decide to join an online course i’d suggest devoting some of your time to looking for outside resources videos/simulations/etc. just so you can really get the jist of things."

Psychosis,foatxif,t3_g6mh9v,1587652450.0,"I guess it just depends on the person, and the severity of it. I do this to my boyfriend. He’s my best friend and i’m so deeply in love with him. Some days I want nothing more than to just be with him and spend time together and just talk for hours about absolutely anything. Other days we get into it because he feels like i’ve been distant and i make him feel unwanted. when this happens i suggest breaking up. I ask him why he wants to be with me if i just make him feel unwanted. I question why even bothers. He tells me he loves me. He’s always so reassuring, almost like second nature. I can’t reciprocate that. I don’t know why. It’s not hard in theory, but in my head it’s so hard, Hes not my whole life, i have a life outside of him, I like to do things alone even if it’s just sitting down and not talking staring at whatever. Nothing can be wrong, i just find comfort in the moment. sometimes i’m distant for a week just minding my own business listening to music. in my own head a lot. then i go back to wanting to be around him almost inseparable at times. On the other hand he doesn’t get it and it makes me feel so bad, I try. Some days i just need time to do things for myself. it might be condescending at times. I think on the outside looking in it’s selfish, or wrong in someway. I do love him and I know he knows that, it’s just hard to remind myself that he needs to be reassured of. He’s the only person i trust 100%. I feel like i can tell him things, like how a girl at school told me something that i felt suspicious about and now i can’t trust her ever and even if he doesn’t understand it he’ll listen and won’t judge me on it, but if i were to tell him something like, I feel like everyone is against me and i don’t know why, it’s like they all know something i don’t, why would they hide it from me? why???” he will work with me and try his best to have me unthink those thoughts. Its one o the things he does that i love about most about him. He makes me feel normal. Even on days when i don’t deserve it. I know it’s a lot for him and i’m forever grateful and it’s a lot for me too just in different ways. My worst fear is that as time goes on he won’t begin to resent the parts of myself I can’t change. that’s a bridge i just have to cross when i get there. If you’re still reading thanks for listening to my little vent. it’s a lot, but with psychosis, you don’t know unless you’ve been there and it’s different for everyone. Having conversations help, there’s a time and place for them. Expressing concerns is okay. I wish you both the best. ❤️"
schizophrenia,foajasd,t1_fla964e,1587647563.0,"I miss it sometimes. It was probably the worst 6 months of my life when i was experiencing through it, thinking i was going to jail, that someone was going to kill me at school, everyone knew something and i had to figure it out.  looking back on it 2+ years later i miss it. I wish i could go back even if it was just a day. There’s a lot i didn’t understand and i never will, but finding the truth was like a quest for me and gave me a bit of purpose."

I was so nervous (it was my first REAL interview) but my interviewer was an amazing woman and gave me a chance, even though i had a lot of nervous laughs and “uhms” and stuttering. when asked what my greater weakness i just kinda “uhh” and she said “it’s okay, it’s hard sometimes.” i composed myself and said that my greatest weakness was my lack of experience, although i feel that it’s not so bad because it gives them an opportunity to mold me however they need to make me a more efficient worker. Ended the interview by saying “You start tomorrow at 2” which was awesome. The problem was on Tuesday everything shut down due to covid-19. I never got to start the first day of my new job at the library. I’m still hopeful for april 14 when supposedly our lockdown will be lifted."

My first time watching that clip with the celebrities was my first introduction to that song. It played the original, then the actors did their little spin on it, like “if i were green i would die” or “im in need of a guy.” I knew it wasn’t “that”, as in i knew the actual lyric was not “if i were green i would die” but i still sang it that way, even to this day i do, because it just rings better in my head than the original."
schizophrenia,fbijrpx,t3_edkmpo,1576903122.0,"Hey, i can relate to this. I know if you were to ask me about it while i was going through it i’d tell you about how much i hated it and all that. It’s been almost two years. When i look back, i wish i could go back. Especially to times where i thought the music i listened to was written specifically for me. There are times i don’t miss, for instance one of my lightbulbs burned out, and another one flickered all the time. i thought the lights were trying to tell me something, like on stranger things, i guess? i don’t know but i would spend HOURS trying to decipher what it said.  it got so bad i had to be hospitalized, and even then, i thought the hospital was a stage made for me. I feel so boring without it now, but i know it ruined a lot of my personal relationships and it affected me more negatively than positively. I’ve been smoking for about a year the first time i didn’t see any negative affects so i kept at it. recently when i’ve smoked i’ve noticed i start to get paranoid thoughts, but i just remind myself that i’m high and that’s all it is.

Her uncle picked up and we told him to meet us at a designated spot. I’m not too social, but i remember asking her about her about her shoes trying to distract her because i assumes she was overwhelmed. I know i would have been terrified. We talked about a bunch of different things. likes and dislikes. her school and her friends. Then her uncle called us and asked us to verify the spot one more time. I asked her if she saw him and when she did. she ran into his arms and i got really teary eyed because who knows what would have happened if someone else with negative intents realized she was lost before us. It was really my best friend that saw her, but we were together. it’s one of those things that really touched my heart."
