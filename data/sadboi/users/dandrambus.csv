mentalhealth,flm7ng2,t3_fplncz,1585276518.0,"Yeah, 25, haven't done anything at all. Don't even have a car. I was my class president voted most likely to succeed. Spent all of 2019 smoking weed in my bedroom at my parents. Spiraled into deep depression. Dissociated. Now I'm on zoloft and start my new full time IT job on Monday! You can do it dude. Whatever you want. Use the internet to your advantage! Just google every question you have and find what makes something click! I figured out I really enjoy computer hardware so I'm getting into IT and I'm teaching myself to code. It's really fuckin hard and i still kinda hate myself. Oh ya in the 5 years since i graduated i gained like 70 lbs and became an alcoholic. Things are way better since the new year and i feel alive and well again. You'll be good i promise. Just put your head to the grindstone and stop comparing yourself to your peers. That was my number one problem. It was fine when I was 19 and everyone was partying with me but now I'm 25 and everyone is either dead, has kids and a house or has moved away and gotten married. Everyone has their own path. Just make some goals, stick to them, accomplish them and get bigger ones then work to accomplish those, then bigger, then bigger. You're the fuckin shit my guy. Let's do this."
mentalhealth,flfwnrn,t3_foinvv,1585120730.0,"Find a way. There is something for you. It sounds prophetic but it's very true. The emptiness is only what you've made it in the chasms of your mind and you have the power to break free from those thoughts and feelings and become someone who is spiritual and successful. Try doing yoga and meditating, I mean REALLY try. I'm your everyday short white guy who never thought I'd be anything. My first touch with the hotline was last August and it was my last. I enjoy life more and more everyday by actually listening to the ""stupid"" things people say like getting sunlight and walking and writing my thoughts. You really are an important individual and there is something of huge value and meaning to come of your life. Your gap will be filled my friend, you just need to find the confidence to keep pushing forward. 

Best wishes and good luck. I love you. Stay positive."

mentalhealth,fl8zhkw,t1_fl8y9ad,1584936404.0,"That's a great way of putting it. Like my biggest take after having first gotten a taste of getting back to ""normal"" and talking about it with people was that, pretty much how you said, it will definitely always be there in some sense because I've learned what it's like and it isn't as if I can erase that memory. I'll always have the recollection of the concept and that, in turn, will always keep it around. Whether or not I slip into it is obviously determined by factors of triggers and drug/alcohol use. 

Nice!

So take a chiller on smoking for a good while still to I feel as though I've recovered while sober and then maybe do some experimenting if I really want to smoke or w.e again. Awesome. I love reddit."
mentalhealth,fl8ul47,t1_fl8sp2e,1584932691.0,"Okay, this is so helpful. Thank you so much for your insight. I've smoked twice since this all began and generally, felt like I was 14 again in terms of levels of comfort and chillness. For the past couple years I've been smoking pretty copious amounts daily and I was definitely DPDR a lot but I associated it with what I was told by peers like ""you're just paranoid"" but after this mid winter episode with the flu and panic attacks, and I started to DPDR 24/7 while sober, i realized what was happening and connected everything. I'll definitely look into the vitamins and stuff, I haven't thought about that at all. It's funny too, where I live, CBD is just recently being sold in gas stations, vape shops, etc.. and I just brought that up to my girlfriend, like hey maybe CBD would help? I'll definitely be doing some experimenting with that as well because all my friends and my sister smoke daily, that's just our vibe, and I feel like they think they have to walk on eggshells around me now. They don't really, I'm sure, but I'd love to just be able to chill again and not have a constant little worry in the back of my head that if I hit one little trigger I'll lose my shit.

Seriously thank you so much, this is probably the most helpful thing I've heard so far. You've given me a lot of hope and confidence just by this, many thanks many many thanks. I really appreciate the genuine response. Especially since our experiences seem fairly similar!"
mentalhealth,fl8om32,t1_fl8mhjm,1584928548.0,"I've read that weed was an issue and I have adjusted my sleep A LOT. I was your classic stoner at moms house playing xbox til 4am doing nothing. I don't smoke or drink now and have been trying to stay consistent with sleeping from 11pm or so to 7am or so, excercises when I wake up and got a full time job. I've definitely felt it be completely gone, like not even thinking about it happening, for consecutive days a few times now.

So what you're saying is basically follow this path and I'll be good?

Do you have any DPDR anymore at all?

I'm only about 2 and a half months into recovery after finding out what was even happening. So I feel like I'm making great progress considering it's only occasional now."
