leanfire,fk2zoah,t3_fcdelb,1583813239.0,"Hello OP! Thank you much for being such a role model. I wanna join the 2 comma club too!  Me: 32yo, 70k income, 250k investments, 139k left on my mortgage & car is paid off. 

I’m interested your rental property. Was this your primary residence until you moved abroad? 

How long did it take to finish paying off your mortgage? 

If You can please give me some advice, what type of home (condo, town home, single detached) should I buy for a rental property? Why? How many rental properties should I be aiming for? 

Also who inspired/ inspires you to Being Financially Independent? Why? 

Thank you"

MakeupAddictionCanada,fcaqnml,t3_egr567,1577574670.0,"Really great thread! I’m on a low-buy/no-buy too for everything in my life and it is really challenging. I really want to follow LEAN FIRE and my hope and dreams is to pay off my mortgage in 5 years! I just finished year 1 and I have gotten the mortgage life down to 14 years. I’m applying A LOT OF DISCIPLE. I know it will feel really good to have accomplished a really big goal. 

I mostly use Tarte and Mac powder foundations and they have a sale 1-3x a year. That’s when I stock up. I would say approximately I spend $150 each to the foundations and I get about 4-6 compacts. 

I have enough blush, lip sticks, and eye shadows from ipsy bags to last me for the year. 

My mascara is the holy grail and I order it off EBay 2-4x a year. 

Skin care will be my danger zone. I need to KIS to a cleanser and moisturizer. I have enough face masks for the entire planet so I need to stay being consistent and using them."

I think they should draw the winner and use their initials and announce on social media that a Calgarian won."

mentalillness,f9p705t,t3_e60uwq,1575523717.0,"OP, I hear you!  Not to take away from the main post but those ideas were so ingrained into me that when I did get sick with depression and psychosis I was doing presentism at work. I showed up because that’s what all adults do. But I didn’t do anything because I was so sick. The best decision my doctor helped me make was to take a sick leave off work to heal and recover. I’m angry at my friends and family who think I just got over the depression and psychosis but in reality I am dealt a new baseline and new coping. I’m not cured!"

MakeupAddictionCanada,f810cq8,t3_dye4im,1574144482.0,"I have oily skin too. Also NC45. 

I currently use and love the Tarte Amazonian Clay Airbrush Foundation. This is amazing and a game changer for me. I use medium beige. The foundation melts into my oily skin and gives me a dewy not greasy look. 

I also alternate and use this and I really like Lise Waiter’s Teint Multi-Fini Compact Foundation. In Neutral. 

For the longest time Physicians Formula was my go to.  And ELF oil control blotting powder. 

I hope this helps!"
