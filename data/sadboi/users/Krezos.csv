SuicideWatch,fr52x1f,t3_gmog50,1589901545.0,Honestly i think it's like that for a lot of people regardless of gender. I guess it depends on who is arund you. Personally i've encountered mostly understanding and i am male. I don't believe that most people who say it would be better if smb dies really want that.

I can imagine it hurts if someone you thought you had a good relationship with doesn't care about you. But then it's best to end it i guess. I haven't experienced much of that though so i don't really know how that goes. I think most people are somewhat nice. Everybody tries to do what they think will benefit them. And that's fine. It's all about finding someone who thinks they can benefit from knowing you and who you think you can benefit from knowing. And if you are not benefitting anymore it might be better to call it off.

Honestly i think it doesn't matter that much whether you fail or don't. It's kinda the same. Of course, (what's the opposite of failing?) feels good sometimes. But the result doesn't matter."
