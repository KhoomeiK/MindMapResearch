But then when her mother forced her to move out and placed her in a house in the middle of nowhere in Missouri with no way to get around, I thought that was unbelievably cruel. I'd expect her mother to help her pack up and move to a new apartment in Houston and take it from there, and Derrikus (pardon me if I misspelled his name) to stay and support her. If the mother couldn't pay Derrikus, he could just work somewhere in Houston. 

When Seana was left on her own, her struggle really started to strike me. She had no support, was unable to get a job, was unable to drive, and bogged down by depression. When she was at the hotel, it seemed like she was just stuck there since she had no help to move out. And it was so heartwarming that Dr. Now continued to help her because of her situation.

Down the road, Seana may make progress with Dr. Paradise and her water aerobics classes while living in a group home and be eventually approved. Or she may be hospitalized on a controlled diet or sent to rehab if she loses mobility. Given her situation, Dr. Now will stick with her to the end, just like Sean. 

I think that Sean and Seana had the same problem: they don't want to be alone - ever. And if Seana gains all the weight lost while hospitalized, she may end up dead prior to age 30 just like Sean."
