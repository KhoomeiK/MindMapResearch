Living a sober life isn't such a bad thing. It's not until you need to seek help, that you realise how destructive alcohol can be.

We are used to the horrors of drug use and other vices, that we don't realise the damage alcohol does. 

The thiamine they gave you is great for healing any brain damage caused by the alcohol. I'm glad your doctor gave you them. If you ever feel like you are struggling, please reach out and talk. 

Being sober doesn't have to mean boring. You'll be surprised to see how much you will actually save by not drinking. A friend of mine uses the extra money to treat herself to new trainers every month. I think mainly it's just important to be kind to yourself. You are doing a great job! 💚"

Luckily I detoxed in a hospital but for anyone reading this, please seek help before just stopping. I've had friends die because of withdrawal and know that it's not easy asking for help.

I had to hit rock bottom before I realised and I've still got a way to go to make amends. I personally found smart recovery to be extremely helpful. I also found that if I allowed my future self lapses, I wouldn't feel so guilty for slipping and was able to get back on track. 

You might find that the worst critic in recovery is yourself, so during your journey learn to forgive yourself. All the negative energy you spend beating yourself up, can be translated into positive energy to rebuild your life.

Although I've found several health problems that the alcohol was masking, I do still think that my life is so much better without alcohol. Last year I had my first Christmas that I can remember because I was sober. New year's was finally a positive welcoming of the new and positive future. My son is finally proud of his mummy instead of being worried and embarrassed. 

Lastly always remember, you are worth it and you can do this. You are an amazing person and you will get better. Take care and stay safe."
