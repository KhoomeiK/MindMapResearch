On top of that since I'm in tourism and hospitality theres very little work to be done for a while still. The first few days I still got up relatively early, did get dressed (though usually not until noon or so) and made sure I had decent meals available 

Now (it's been idk a few weeks?) I get up maybe half hour before I clock in and start, often dont get dressed at all, down a whole pot of coffee before noon, sorta snack on stuff and CAN NOT STAY FOCUSED FOR SHIT 

My insomnia is also back with a vengeance.  And I feel even less justified in my struggles because I actually have 3 roommates and we get along great! But we're all pretty introverted too and even being under stay at home orders (though for the most part we dont get out much anyway) we dont necessarily see or interact with each other much 

I've found myself starving for more social interaction and feel like I'm annoying the hell out of one of my best friends in another state because I text him SO MUCH lately 

The loss of almost all of my routine on top of being pretty newly diagnosed and also barely starting meds of any kind is not going well for me"
