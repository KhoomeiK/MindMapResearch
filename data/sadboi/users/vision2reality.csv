I am going thru something similar.  Off 1 year now (since 4th Nov).    Was horrible also for 6-8 months but better the last few months.    Now I have a return in physical symptoms.    Back pain, numbness (arms. legs, feet,), sleep troubles ( morning surges are back).   I've seen youtube vids that say that there is often a surge right before final healing so I hope this is the case.

benzorecovery,evtc2w1,t1_evsye9a,1564767218.0,GAD is an anxious state yet doctors still try to 'help us' with antidepressants. Sad.  Whatever the reason behind the symptom... Maybe muscle relaxation and meds might help.
intermittentfasting,evsw7mc,t1_evsrbag,1564757538.0,Im awaiting the proof.  Thanks.
intermittentfasting,evsr9y3,t1_evsqy7w,1564754371.0,It is my opinion.  As you have yours.    Thanks
intermittentfasting,evsqs84,t1_evsqfzb,1564754038.0,My response was based on the thought that the gum was suggered.
benzorecovery,evskoh9,t3_cl38p9,1564749384.0,Lexapro is a very potent anti depressant and any doc who gives this for this diagnosis is lost...way lost.   Lexapro also has a horrible withdrawal.  It is not in any way linked to gaba but to serotonin.  Big time.    Ps. Tried Lexapro during my taper....caused horrible anxiety...almost jumped off a balcony after 11 days.  Ask for another type of medication...muscle relaxer maybe.
intermittentfasting,evskihc,t1_evsjvyi,1564749242.0,Yes.  It seems to be....but seems that certain sugar replacements sent same signals to the brain.  No biggie.

intermittentfasting,evsiq45,t3_cl31pd,1564747651.0,Crazy to say but be careful with sugared gum.    Might signal insulin release in the fasting window.
Anxiety,evsim11,t3_cl3624,1564747545.0,Part of getting better is accepting and doing stuff anyways.   Day by day.  Not accepting your present state will only make it worse in the long run.
intermittentfasting,evsii98,t3_cl366y,1564747444.0,What are your scale results?    Are you changing your foods and calories in your feeding window?
benzorecovery,ev5rkc5,t1_ev5r3ky,1564237833.0,"Thanka for the reply.  It is getting better.  Almost 9 months off for me.  It's seems like my muscles are slowly being less tense especially my neck, head, face where I had many months of ears pain, dizziness, tinittus, etc."
benzorecovery,ev2rcjw,t1_ev2p35d,1564182377.0,I totally relate to this message especially the face stuff. I have been having ear and face popping noise for months. The face pressure and linked dizziness and boaty feeling is lessening. I often have one sided (left) stuffiness and congestion especially upon awakening.

benzorecovery,ev1zqpb,t1_ev1z0h8,1564167943.0,I find that overly long tapers are not always the best to do.   I concider myself an 'accidental addict' because I was give this for Post operarative muscle spasms and never told it was a benzo and not to be taken 9 yrs.

benzorecovery,euggtae,t1_euggcwh,1563807574.0,Thanks for the long complet reply.   I went to Er to get checked out because of a pain I have by my bellybutton and also the whole body pain stuff.   The doc thinks I might have an umbilical hernia and it can cause belly digestion pain and he also confirms that benzo withdrawal is very real (my general practitioner does not seem to) and that my muscle pains and stuff is quite normal even 9 months off. He was not able to tell me why my ears are constantly clicking and popping.
