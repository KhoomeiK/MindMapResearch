I ordered the new zepheryus G15 and while one ram socket  is soldered, the other isnt, so if i ever need more than 16GB ill be able to switch out one for a single 32GB stick and disable the other channel. Which from my cursory look though 32gb laptop ram, will be less than paying 500 extra euro.

Now obv if youre on logic or pro tools or youre already heavily invested in the mac lifestyle,  my point is moot.  But food for thought, windows can be trash but its also quite versitile when you want (force) it to be.

Edit: also just saying the G15 is like 2k cheaper for also 8 core, 16gb, 1 tb ssd.    Again there are benefits to mac, and i know the screen is going to be way better than what i have coming.

  Idk i guess what im saying is, if 3200 euro is already your budget, go ahead and get the extra ram."

your percussion sounds great,  It has the right amount of tonal movement to keep it interesting and sits clear and present.  

But your bass and lead I feel should move slightly differently.  Like your percs tones go up and down and return to where they were, but i feel like it would sound more interesting if the harmonics of your bass/lead would maybe dip a bit and then rise up to end in a different spot from where their phrase started.

chaosmagick,f4h48y6,t3_djqzjt,1571587857.0,"The first ritual i did was for quitting nicotine (two months ago). 

What i did: 

-created a sigil

-stated my intent, then about 5-10 minutes of meditation and then a few aums to finish that off.  
(These two sections didnt necessairly occure in this order)
-I evoked christ, which was also a part of me giving up my personal dogmas because i had an aversion to christianity in general, as well as knowing the first 3 days are the worst and drew a parallel to christ rising again on the 3rd day.

-i then went on a 5 mile jog, with my sigil ( jogging is a large part of how i charge my sigils).  On the back half i experienced an aura (if unfamillear, they generally accompany migranes and siezures), which has happened before when i was without nicotine. It cleared up right around the time i returned home.

-i then did another brief meditation, some aums.  i burned the sigil and declared the ritual complete.

But i feel the actual important part of this was, afterwards, my mindset was ""i no longer live in a universe in which i use nicotine."" 

 It was still a very difficult week, those first few days i was constantly tense, my muscles felt on the verge of spasms and i was always wriggling in my seat. 

 Not to mention the mental toll and the realization that the way i managed my emotions was by subdueing them with nicotine and not allowing myself to truely feel those emotions.  You will be suprised the way things ""feel"" for a few weeks.  Both emotionally and physically.

  (Just want to add, physically, i was suprised how it felt when proper bloodflow returned to my extremities.  My face felt like it felt when i would trip.  And better blood flow in your sexual organs is a nice perk, coupled with that more noticable hit of dopamine when youre not constantly getting that hit from nicotine. )

But after a week it became easier, after two even more so, and after three i felt pretty much normal.  

The first two weeks i did allow myself to over indulge in food but managed to cut that off after two weeks.  I continued to jog 4-5 days a week, but that was already a habit (also i vaped, but 2 months later my stamina and lung capacity is much better).  If you dont exercise i highly reccomend it to help body and mind deal with the withdrawls.  

Lastly, learn to experience the cravings differently.  When you have one, BREATH. Use your breath to satisfy the  craving.  Turn that feeling from a negative to a positive.  Because the cravings wont stop, my mother quit nicotine 5 years ago and she still has them from time to time (given she smoked for like 50 years).  But unlike her i did some chaos magic mental gymnastics and my brain doesnt look at that feeling as ""i need nicotine"" anymore, now its just a reminder to take some nice, calm, deep breaths. 

So that's that, sorry it was a bit rambly and long but I hope I was able to get what helped me across to you."

Which still sucked but at the same time i felt it was easier than all my previous attempts and so far a month in i feel much less tempted to vape/smoke cigs.  So far im 3 and 1 on my sigil success rate, which that one still may take some time.  The first two i feel worked in the psychological model, which is the mindset id had.  But the last sigil i cast,  i cast in somewhat of an emotional desperation to help someonebi love, and even at the time I didn't think I had much of a chance but somehow it came to fruition and i honestly think now there is more to this than reprogramming our sub/unconsious.

chaosmagick,f0z1emf,t3_d62e68,1569083986.0,"Im new here too, just been practicing for a little over a month, but i just started reading Condensed Chaos 4 days ago.

Imo, (if you havent already listened) for a decent streamlined overview and some personal experiences from two of the hosts, Last Podcast on the Left's episodes on chaos magic are what got me interested.  They also have episodes on left hand and right hand path magic if youre interested in any of that.

That and read (again if you havent) The Invisibles by Grant Morrison. Theyre good comics and get your mind accustomed to thinking in a different way about reality as well as somewhat giving you the gist of what chaos magic is about while at the same time making for an action packed and unique comic series.  Just dont take his writing too literally."
AmItheAsshole,f0svda8,t1_f0rtnqb,1568911258.0,"Problem with that is im pretty sure Jamal has already dealt with a fair share of discrimination in his life. He certainly doesnt deserve it but black people are not unaware of the bigotry and prejudice many white people feel.  

Ill concede, maybe (and i mean maybe as im not sure this is a good approach) the parent should bring it up with the grand parents first and say if you cant handle it then you shouldnt be around them.  

But honestly how does that help?  The only way i can see the racist climate changing is if people who dont like black people (or any race/ethnicity/sexuality too) or interracial relationships get first hand experience that these people are people just like you.  

We have to interact with those that are different than us if any meaningful change can come about.  Sometimes people have to be semi-forced into it because the very idea repulses them for whatever reason.  

This isnt an issue to be delicate with and protect people from.  We should put what makes people uncomfortable in front of their faces.  Let them see what is actually there instead of what their preconceptions are.  Let them have a wider idea of what other humans truely are.  

And unless they mean you physical harm or are advocating violence at large, in my opinion treat them with love and kindness and patience.  But do not ever shy away because youre afraid they will feel uncomfortable or will cause a scene.  Thats on them if they do."

KidsAreFuckingStupid,f0doond,t1_f0d9b90,1568556783.0,"So not who youre responding to, but they probably made that assumption based on every day experiences of seeing parents giving their toddlers soda.  I see way too much of it myself.  I was given soda as a kid and drank multiple sodas every day until i was 19. ( I was obese throughout my childhood and teen years, partially due to the extra 600 calories or more i was consuming every day from coke and mountain dew and even as an adult im drinking 3-5 cups of coffee a day because ive been consuming caffiene since i was like 2) So assuming thats soda in the Hardees cup isnt a streach.  

I get it may be annoying to see people calling these things out repeatedly but we do have an issue with parents understanding what is appropriate for children and what is not."

oldfreefolk,f0470oc,t3_d3hil8,1568381147.0,"A comment mostly unrelated to the current drama:

Thanks to season 8 being an absolute dumpster fire, i was inspired to actually start reading A Song of Ice and Fire to remember the good writing.

But just before i found out about all this BS yesterday, i wrapped up the chapter in A Storm of Swords where Tormund tells Jon how he became the Giantsbane and Husband to Bears and just... Gods there was good writing then...  

Im really looking forward to being angry all over again when GRRM dies on a mound of gold with the series unfinished."

Turned out as delicious as i expect from an alton brown recipe.  The only thing is, id say use slightly less salt than the recipe calls for.  But i can also be kind of shakey measuring salt so could have been my bad."
spicy,ez4ywob,t1_ez43mn9,1567694184.0,Kind of like garlic.  I was making tomato sauce last week.  Pounded up 8 cloves with olive oil and salt and gave it a taste.

Drugs,eym8798,t1_eym5a8l,1567201956.0,"Im past the withdrawls, i just still try and reach for my ecig or be at work headed to break and think time to smoke.  But even the cravings have gotten pretty tame by now.  

Those first 3 days though are fucking rough mentally though. Anxiety, constantly fidgiting (which i already do but way worse), couldnt sleep longer than an hour at a time, constipation.

But as someone else in the thread said, drink water, exercise, keep busy and imo maybe treat yourself to an extra sweet or two but dont let that be a new habit.  I also kept reading on the negative effects of nicotine to remind myself why i should keep at it.

But 9 days in, and just found out my blood pressure is back within normal range so thats nice.  Over all i actually feel better than i did a week and a half ago.  This isnt the first time ive ""quit"" but it sure as shit is gonna be the last time.  


And on a side side note, the blood flow returning to my face made my face feel like it feels when i used to trip.  Honestly that plus the headspace i was in i def felt a bit trippy, but not in a fun way."

Good job man, idk about you but the feeling of circulation coming back really suprised me.  And without that constant hit of pleasure throughout the day, food is incredible.  Ate a pepperoni and anchovie pizza on day 3 and it was a complete food orgasm."

One because im the only one who is willing to hear them 'rant' and im patient with their personality quirks, the other because the way i work makes their job easier and we have a good rapport in general.  But these actions arent things i ever think about, and i assume others dont either. Its just what i do.

Sometimes you are making a positive difference in peoples lives, sometimes without trying, or without even noticing."
