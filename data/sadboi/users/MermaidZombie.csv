pics,fq1xsd5,t1_fpzi69e,1589050944.0,"So by your argument they should just always use white babies because as soon as they use one of another race that means they're trying to play a PR game? I recognize that that IS what's happening, but that's kind of missing my point.

I agree that they, and every other company, should donate to those causes and do something real. I understand that they probably ARE playing a PR game and that Gerber and especially Nestle are garbage companies as a whole.

My only point is that I think it's sad that, in general, people of other races are involved in the media and many professions rarely enough that it stands out so much when they do. I just want it to get to the point where people of every race are used naturally for all forms of media so much so that it's normalized. If black babies were used in advertising a lot more often, then it wouldn't stand out so much as to cause a political conversation.

Basically I'm just excited for the day when everyone is chosen for jobs based on personal merit and race isn't a factor anymore, so much so that when we see a black or Asian baby or a baby with a disability in advertising we don't have to question the motives. I know we're far from that, but it'll be nice when we get there.

Hopefully that makes sense."
pics,fq1l37o,t1_fpz8vco,1589046606.0,"While I understand that Gerber isn't a particularly ethical company so this likely is a very intentional game they're playing, my only point is just that I'm excited for the day when all races are used  across every profession and every role in the media to the point that it's normalized and just seen as people being people, being chosen based on their individual merits. I understand that's not what's happening here with this particular example, I'm just saying I'm sad that it still stands out so much when a person who isn't white is chosen for a typically white role that it has to be a topic of conversation and cynicism. By ""typically white role"" here I don't mean Gerber baby as apparently that's very mixed, but rather just media and advertising as a whole.

I also think it's okay that POC are perhaps over-represented here just simply because white people are over-represented just about everywhere else in the media, aside from a few very specific instances. If we're going to pick up pitchforks as soon as they pass their proportionate numbers in overall population, for Gerber babies, why don't we do the same every time white people pass their proportionate numbers in newscasting, most films, most television shows, etc.?"

That being said, it is a huge step in the right direction that such a gigantic, trendsetting corporation would include something as blatant as a kiss in such a gigantic, anticipated movie.
