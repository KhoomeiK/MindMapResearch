DID,fp70c4i,t3_gbjgrq,1588361745.0,"People have no control on what kind of alters we create. We create alters based on need. Let's say you grew up with someone that has black skin, or have an idol that has black skin, a protagonist in a show having black skin etc... A child might associate the skin color as a certain trait. If that protagonist was very brave and confident, a child may associate black skin with being brave and confident. This, of course, doesn't make much sense. But remember, it's a child's brain. 

Is it racist to have all white alters? No. As I said, no control over what your alters are like. Personally, we have no black alters. May sound surprising, but the first time we saw an actual black person was in late childhood. We weren't really exposed to it. At least that's what I think it's about anyway. 

Is it okay for an alter to identify with their race? It's a bit confusing but I'd say yes. Just like an alter can say ""I'm male"" in a female body, an alter can also say ""I'm black"" in a white body. If an alter wants to learn and practice the culture, that's fine to me. If an alter wants to join support groups for POC, not really fine. A black alter in a white body doesn't go through the same hardships and troubles as someone in a black body. Just like how a white alter in a black body doesn't have the same privileges as someone in a white body"

 ""Do you know what dissociative identitity disorder is?"" Yes? No? 
If they say no, tell them what it is. Be very in depth. What is it? How's it caused? (Don't focus on the trauma part too much if you mention it. They'll have questions) Assure them this isn't something that makes you crazy. I'm sure if you explain it in the right way, they won't have a harsh reaction"
