selfimprovement,fhh3lb7,t3_f34faa,1581592199.0,"You can open up to your friends but don't say to them your very deepest weaknesses and strengths because they might use against you. I can relate to you and it happened to me before. I have a lot of friends but most of them don't ""check in"" with me or they don't think of me just like what you have said. It happens for most people. 

 I am gonna be honest here, you should change your thinking habits. You are basically doing self-pity. It happened to me before and I have realized in the long run that my empathy is gone and most of the time I am being self-pity and constantly thinking about myself. Just think of this. Imagine one of your friends also feels that feeling. Instead of feeling down on yourself, try to be the one who always checks on them and give them importance. So that you will bring a solid relationship in the long run. Try to be in their shoes and ask ""what if, they also feel alone despite of having many friends"". 

For me, this thing works I don't know if it will work for you but hopefully this will help you a lot."
