schizophrenia,f1egq9a,t3_d942qv,1569421841.0,"CONTEXT:
Acquired full onset schizophrenia last year due to going off meds and smoking weed constantly. Big mistake obviously, ended up in multiple psych wards.

Been kind of paranoid since middle school, possibly due to trauma. Had my main symptom barely while growing up sometimes, just when I’d hear a noise, usually when bored, and I could make it sound like it was counting, or even saying “left right” if my feet were in gravel. A few years ago I stayed in a trailer with mold and a clogged bathroom (uncleaned for half a year), by the end of the first week I experienced the paranoia that there was a man with a knife outside trying to kill me, and could almost see big black spiders rushing up from my blanket at me.

Two years ago I moved into an apartment that didn’t trigger any type of hallucination, but may have worsened paranoid thinking. Things took a turn for the worse when I met my ex in November of that fall. There was a lot of concepts of “magic” that passed their way on to me through them. I’m into astrology and experience a lot of strange coincidences, so it felt good to have a justification for things I felt about the universe having some kind of shared energy flow. My ex’s apartment was probably fine, just a grad student dorm on the east coast. My ex’s house though was 100% filled with mold, they said they asked their dad to paint over the mold on their ceiling because I got “freaked out” by mold, and at the time, I didn’t care because they seemed to know how to handle it... But I couldn’t, and could see how much they suffered from it. Extreme brain fog, increased . We smoked a lot of weed in the ~2 weeks we were there, but not as much as we would when I moved in with them.

At some point last year after getting off my meds, I started hearing voices as my ability to speak to people, have organized thoughts (if any thoughts at all), and even move around with ease. Lots of factors for that, living/being in a tiny room 90% of the time and unknowingly going through an abusive, toxic relationship don’t help. My ex hospitalized me, and the doctors shot me up with so many drugs (without my consent) that I experienced hallucinations 100% of the time.

I’m extremely (rationally) paranoid about mold, especially since my apartment mates two years ago neglected to tell me until signing the lease (we were in their landlord/realtor’s office and it was too late to find a new place because of school) there had been a case of mold (that was “fixed”) in the room I lived in."
