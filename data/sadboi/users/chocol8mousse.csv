ArtistLounge,fotga24,t3_g9e3t8,1588053063.0,"I feel this way too. And I've found a decent way to tackle this problem. 

I decided to limit my use of social media. And I started using it to strictly check it for references and specific inspiration. It's definitely hard to get rid of this mindset and even I'm not 100% free of it. But this method has helped a lot.

You need to actively work towards ridding yourself of it. Look at artworks but maintain a habit of only looking at them through a critical eye. Look at the technique, the inspiration behind it, the thought process and try not to think too much about the beauty and the accomplishment. Acknowledge it's achievement but leave it at that and then focus on your own work. 

Reading artist biographies also helps. Because you realise, even the greatest artists who we believe to be born talented or what not, had to work hard for decades to reach the point where they gained recognition. And also, even after reaching that point, many of them were still not satisfied by their work. 

Remember that you're always learning and developing your art. And so are the people whose art you see. They are on their own journey and you need to focus on your own. Everything else will fall into place by itself."

If the jars taking space bothered you so much, you could've discussed an alternative with her but no, you had to go and just throw it out. Even if the drinks weren't fancy to you, they were fancy to her. She had also spent so long collecting all the jars and your just the them out in such an inconsiderate manner. And you still show no remorse or sympathy.

It is also very clear from what you said that you aren't going to consider opinions that don't match with yours so clearly you just came here to get validation which you aren't going to get.

How many people can relay a feeling or emotion without using any of the usual means of depiction. Eg. A crying man/woman to show sadness, a smiling person to show happiness, etc.

I agree that these days, we see a lot of random abstract art which just is shapes and colours without any thought behind them. But I feel, good abstract art requires just as much talent as any other art form."

You can practice this with drawing shapes over photos on magazines or anywhere else to practice. And once you recognise the shapes, you can try to draw them by yourself.

You can also try just focusing on getting better at different body parts separately and then trying to make them all together in a full portrait or body drawing. It helped me because then I could focus on the details and accuracy of specific body parts instead of worrying about everything else that I'd need to learn and perfect. One step at a time. (:"
