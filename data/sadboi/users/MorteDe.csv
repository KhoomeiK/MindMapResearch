Not that it really matters, but I'm a girl.  The bathroom is next to the steps, so I can see how the pipes would be leading there.  Damn."
Paranormal,fp58wl3,t1_fp58m5p,1588320429.0,Thank you for your advice.  I'm sorry if I'm not explaining it very well.  I'm guessing the house is about a hundred years old.  Idk what kind of pipes.  The door to his room is about 5 feet from the top of the stairs.  The bathroom and all 3 bedrooms are on the 2nd floor.
Paranormal,fp58n91,t1_fp57zvz,1588320158.0,"Lol.  That's funny.  This isn't urine though.  The bathroom is right across the hall from our bedrooms.  

I work overnights, and he works 2nd shift.  There were no wet spots on the stairs Tuesday night when I left for work.  None when he went to bed around 2am.  But when I got home Wednesday morning at 7am the top two steps were both wet, directly in the middle of the steps where we walk.  If it was a pipe in the wall, wouldn't the wet spot be close to the wall?"
Paranormal,fp58buu,t1_fp57ymw,1588319834.0,"Hmm.  I did suggest a leak to him at first, but we were thinking it had to be from above.  Hmm.  But how could the leak move?  I mean, the staircase...  There are like 15 I think, then they turn, and there are 3 more steps.  The first wet spots were on steps closer to the first floor, then they were in his bedroom, then the hall just outside the doorway of his room, then the lower steps again, and yesterday the top two steps.  The steps are carpeted, btw."

Paranormal,fp575dy,t1_fp56nox,1588318639.0,Do pipes typically run under stairs though?  Seems odd...
Paranormal,fp56obo,t1_fp53tmk,1588318153.0,"Because there is no explanation for it.  The spots are sopping wet, but there is no water source.  It's bizarre.  There aren't pipes running under our staircase.  There are no leaks in the ceiling above it.  No open windows.  

The spots are in the middle of our steps, where someone would walk.  They are on the steps, or next to my roommate's bed, or right outside his bedroom."

What was up with the splinters?  Especially, how did Sean get splinters on his butt?  

What was the significance of the basement floor cracking?  I wondered if it was just a visual metaphor.  Earlier in the season Sean is sanding the wood floor, which represents how they were treating the surface of the problem of Jericho being dead.  Later on, Dorothy's very foundation is cracked when she starts to remember what happened when she holds that little girl's doll.  The basement floor cracking shows the foundation of the lie is falling apart."
