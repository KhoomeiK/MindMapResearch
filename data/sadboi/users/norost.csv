You have absolutely nothing to lose if you say to yourself you will postpone killing yourself for two weeks and try it.

I have severe anxiety, depression ( meds just make me functional, but far from living normaly), stuck in my past the moment i wake up, huge fear of my future, intrussive thoughts. Thought of ending it all many, many times. I never thought meditation would help me. But than one day i found a video on youtube by accident of a guy talking about this stuff in our lives and how you can fix it. His name is dr. Joe dispenza. I have to say that what he talks about makes a lot of sense to me and it helps me to slowly get better.

Pyrography,fjcckzo,t3_fbevv6,1583215149.0,"I had that problem when i was starting Pyrography. I wanted to publish what i made, so i wanted a picture that was mine alone. If you like tribal paterns you can use Inkscape to make them over existing pictures. Its easy and looks good. For normal pictures to trace them i used photoshop and modifyed an existing picture to Line drawing. I also used an application on my phone called Sketch camera. It makes a picture in Line drawing so you can see how a picture will look like before you take it. Than you just print it. Hope it helps"

depression,f54g64v,t3_dmndhe,1571981106.0,"Jup. Same here. Every job i take is worse than the previous. 32 yo btw. Money situation is horrible because of it. I do keep fighting, but some days it seems utterly hopeless.

Trying to do something with my hobby for some extra cash, but it's hard.
I just want to have a job and do something that will not be a nightmare and earn some money so i can live a decent life.

Its like i am asking for a winning ticket in a lottery"
depression,f4pzkuz,t3_dlg18t,1571745567.0,"Sometimes i think the same way you do right now. Than i remember all the horrible stuff i already survived and feel it would be a shame to just let it all go and be done with it.

Try to think of it this way. Whatever dosent kill you makes you stronger. You have greatness in yourself, you just need to unlock it. Not one person that ever lived that did something meaningfull and worth remembering, had an easy life. It's the strugles in life that make you. 

I used to pitty myself for being one of the depressed ones. For having to live with this curse. Not anymore. I pitty the ones that are ""normal"".

Try doing whatever you can to be happy. Even if at this moment nothing makes you happy. Go to pinterest for example and look at the pictures, mayby you see something you like.

Hope it helps

Also... fuck you depression!"

depression,f4kfznh,t3_d9f2m4,1571649989.0,Damn. I feel right at home here. I thought i was the only one strugling with this issue. My friends and family are dissapointed by me. I see it every day in my parents eyes. I should have a good life. My parents worked their ass off to make it possible for me. But i always screwed it all up. I feel misserable and guilty most of the time and have no clue as what to do with my life.
