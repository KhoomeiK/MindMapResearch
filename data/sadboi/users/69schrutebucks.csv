Unfortunately, with the way I wound up getting my bipolar diagnosis, I couldn't keep it a secret. Then I found out after a few years that my in laws were spreading lies about how insane I allegedly am to get people to avoid me. I realized then that there is no point to pretending to be normal-which I was trying to do with my in laws. Now I'm vocal about it amongst my friends and on social media (friends only) and occasionally write short pieces about my experiences with disclosure, advice for those in crisis, advice for the occasional shitty day, how to cope when you or a loved one are hospitalized, etc. 

A lot of us hide and I do this for myself and for those who otherwise would go on thinking the wrong way about those with mental health conditions. To you, keeping it a secret may be the most pragmatic way to live with it. I get it. I don't tell strangers and I don't mention it at jobs unless I need an accommodation. I won't keep it a secret amongst my friends, though. Anyone who can't love me for who I am, whether I have a label or not, doesn't need to be around me. I think both of our choices for disclosure/nondisclosure are great. 

Btw if I could have kept it a secret, I would have only kept it a secret from my in laws. Never my friends-they have been the biggest source of support for me. I hope the people you told are the same for you. This shit is hard."

You're trying, she's doing everything she can to show you that you are an outsider and that you will never be part of their family. I don't like that he's putting that on you."
JUSTNOMIL,fnrzenr,t1_fnry0ts,1587207460.0,He isn't keeping the peace. He's abandoning you to placate them. That's not keeping the peace at all because it's creating the opposite of peace between the two of you. At this point he's playing a role in your ostracism.
TwoXChromosomes,fnrz2cr,t3_g388wk,1587207097.0,"This post and some of the comments have shown me that women are probably never going to just support other women. Good god, people. ""stop shaming women in childbirth"" ""ugh you don't need to share that you didn't have an epidural, ugh who even cares""

Such Mean Girl behavior."
TwoXChromosomes,fnpxl8r,t1_fnpww9h,1587153837.0,"When the contractions just fade away, that is the best feeling ever. The absence of excrutiating pain is euphoric! I can't think of many better shows to watch during such a time, you picked a good one."
TwoXChromosomes,fnpvio1,t1_fnpsj0o,1587152765.0,Yep. I've done both med free and with an epidural. Both were worthy of being mentioned in my story- just the same as everyone else. Best wishes for a smooth safe delivery!
TwoXChromosomes,fnpv8t6,t3_g388wk,1587152621.0,"Aren't you 'shaming' someone for merely saying she had a baby with no pain meds? Unless she put someone down or was gloating, this post is BS."
TwoXChromosomes,fnpv4rh,t1_fnprpq0,1587152564.0,Or she could be proud of herself for achieving a goal she set for herself
AsOneAfterInfidelity,fnpmyof,t1_fnpmnjz,1587148338.0,"If it makes you feel better to take a steaming dump all over OP's positive post, go for it. It's cruel, but it's your opinion and you're entitled to it."
AsOneAfterInfidelity,fnplyu8,t1_fnpluxm,1587147836.0,"Yep. Plus, why say that stuff when someone is telling us about progress their WS is making? Save that shit for a WS who isn't doing the work, not one who is!"
AsOneAfterInfidelity,fnplnhw,t1_fnplgyz,1587147675.0,"You told her that her 2 year relationship means nothing and you told her to leave when she came here to post something good. In case you didn't realize it, this sub is centered around reconciliation. She's posting positive things and progress her WS has made-what you said wasn't necessary and wasn't really called for."
AsOneAfterInfidelity,fnplcp6,t1_fnpl0aj,1587147525.0,Don't tear OP down.
