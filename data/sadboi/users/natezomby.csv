d100,f61bpl7,t3_dq0tyb,1572637347.0,"* A Principality with a tin pot dictator who literally wears a tin pot. People would laugh at him if the pot wasn't actually an artifact allowing him to control the human-sized old tin soldiers which guard the place. The dictator will request an audience with any traveler who may know something about healing. In his paranoia that someone would steal the Tin Soldier's Crown he has bolted it to his skull and it is becoming infected, his brain injured and fevered. He sees enemies everywhere and executes villagers randomly.  His Tin Soldiers drag them out of bed in the middle of the night and chop them up in the street, leaving the grieving and cleanup to the commoners. Other than this, the area is safe from all forms of monsters as the Tin Soldiers scare them off, clacking their nutcracker mouths at them. Merchants are safe and come through often. The noble's flag has a nutcracker-like face wearing a tin pot on it.

* Dogtown is entirely occupied by dogs. A circle of spellcasters who loved dogs Awakened dozens of adopted dogs and used limited polymorphing magic to give them working hands some time ago. Generations later, puppies born here receive the same blessing of intelligence and form, even those born of normal dogs. The dogs are good natured and love play fighting and chasing about despite their intelligence. Shepherd is a common occupation. Rabid dogs are cured by a spellcasting Corgi who will pay for sick dogs to be captured alive and rabies infected dire racoons and opossums to be hunted down. Dogtown has a feud with Cattown on the other side of the hill."
d100,f618h0z,t3_dq0tyb,1572635454.0,"* In this town the autumnal colored trees lining the red stone streets grow strange leaves with simple [fortune cookie messages](http://www.fortunecookiemessage.com/) written on them in natural leaf discolorations which appear when they are plucked by a person. The locals know the leaves of the Fortune Foliage are useless at telling the future, they were just an experimental marketing campaign devised to show off by Gardo the Gardener Mage decades ago. Seeds planted grow into trees faster in more magical areas and fortunes are always written in a language the leaf plucker speaks. 

* This settlement is built on the stinking deltas of a heavily polluted river. Rotting wooden stilts hold homes above the muck. The water is choked with trash and the bodies of animals. The common people bathe, dispose of their dead, defecate and urinate, fish, swim and drink all with the same river. Many people die of diseases here and are then ""buried at sea"" into the same waters that killed them. The oily river catches fire every now and then, causing massive death and destruction. The main source of income is scavenging the refuse thrown into the water upriver by a wealthy, clean city. Occasionally half dead victims of the city wash up and lay low here. River Rot Worms infest wood and flesh left in the water for too long. Squeezing the flesh of the infected pops dozens of these maggots out. They are ""farmed"" on sickly cattle and stray cats and dogs which are kept caged in partially submerged cages, then popped like blisters into pots and boiled into a thin gruel. Necromancers hate River Rot Worms, they destroy everything that could be reanimated, even boring through bones. Rations here are made of ground up and smoked River Rot Worm ""Jerky"", it tastes like boiled fat. Recruiting minions is easy here, no one wants to stay here. In fact, many people accept indentured servitude where they pay their employer back with years of work for the privilege of leaving."
d100,f614ipw,t3_dq0tyb,1572632921.0,"* This hamlet is just now being built; it's a stark contrast to the ancient towns brimming with old legends, entrenched nobles and statues of heroes an adventurer might normally visit. There are wooden frames with carpenters hammering, foundations being dug by workmen, muddy footpaths covered with wooden planks instead of roads, and the sounds of lumberjacks working in the surrounding trees. People live out of a caravan of covered wagons and hastily built tents. There is no tavern or inn, but a family may be convinced to allow travelers to rest in their wagon for some work. Perhaps using spells to move water, wood, stone or soil, or shapeshifting into a beast of burden, or handling the animals moving the lumber around, or pulling out a strongly rooted tree stump. Lots of work to do. The entire area is actually a Genius Loci - the land itself is conscious and awakens every 10 years, that's why the landscape is perfectly untouched. It may turn out to be friend or foe depending on your negotiations. It speaks through a possessed animal. If negotiations for the safety of the hamlet break down the land itself comes alive. It attacks by rolling boulders, shooting geysers of water, clawing trees, and the ground swallowing buildings and animals. 

* This town is found among ruins or wilderness. A perfectly normal place. The people do what you expect them to do. Guards patrol, shop keeps sell wares, children play with a ball in the street, a tavern serves ale and rents rooms. There's a simple stone and earthworks wall 10 feet high with guard towers at the four corners of town. The place is full of thatched roof cottages and cobblestone roads. Food and alcohol served to the traveler tastes good but doesn't fill the belly, leaving them hungry and sober. Items bought here are found to be rusted, rotten and falling apart when removed from the town. If you sleep in the town the people do not recognize you the next day and repeat their conversations and actions from the day before. If a traveler attempts to touch a villager (such as pickpocketing, shaking hands, playing with a kid, or attacking) their hand goes right through them. If villagers are pressed for information or shown proof of their curse they will become confused and terrified. They then disappear as they stare at their fading hands and beg for help. Villagers reappear in an unobserved spot with no recollection of having disappeared a minute later. (Money spent can be taken back without consequence, because the shop keeper will attempt to grab the thief, pass through them, and begin to fade to nothing and cry out in shock before disappearing.) The perfectly maintained roads turn into overgrown uneven ruins with trees sprouting through the cobblestones a short distance outside the town gates. A little girl made a wish that ""today would never end"" while playing with her father who was about to head off to war hundreds of years ago. They can be found in a meadow of wildflowers behind a small cottage, the father throwing her in the air above his head and catching her as she laughs. The wish was heard by an evil Unseelie Fey who cursed the entire town for her amusement and forgot about it shortly after, moving on to her next cruel mercurial interest. A traveler can end the curse by slaying this evil Fey, which will appear if the little girl is confronted and convinced to take back her wish. The evil Fey is irritated and arrogant, behaving as though you are breaking her toys."
