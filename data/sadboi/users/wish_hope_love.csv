That was what finally made her successfully pass - having someone read the questions while having background noise blocked out. She has ADHD - Inattentive / Impulsive Type, plus anxiety."

Don‚Äôt go, i love you so much, can‚Äôt live without you, bs.

But, he was a boy and wanted his privacy when he was 8 or 9 years old so my parents let him move down there. One day, I decided to do some laundry and didn‚Äôt have quite a full load. Go into his room to see if he had anything. A few items on the floor...ok, those will do. One pair of pants was inside out. Yep, put my hand in there to right them and pulled out a fucking water bug. It‚Äôs been almost 35 years since it happened and when I think about it, I can feel it‚Äôs legs on my palm. EWWWWWWWWW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Shudder!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

My cousin & her husband brought f‚Äông styrofoam bowls and threw them in my trash when they were done. And, there was more than 2 in there. EVERYONE else respected my wishes & brought bowls from home. 

Also, I sent this text on Friday (the day before the get together). Found out after everyone left that her husband wore his f‚Äông boots in my house the entire time even though I requested everyone remove their shoes. It‚Äôs always been our rule...we have hardwood floors throughout our house. He removes his shoes at my brother‚Äôs, so not sure what the heck is up with that.

todayilearned,ff030kv,t3_equ0ve,1579464652.0,"I worked at a Blockbuster in Laguna Niguel, CA back in 1991-1992. We would take off late fees all the time. I don‚Äôt recall us ever charging people exorbitant amounts for late movies. That‚Äôs crazy. We must‚Äôve had a lenient manager. üòÄ

I was working one night when we heard from a customer that the L.A. riots were working their way into south L.A. County and into Orange County. I don‚Äôt know if it was true or not, but I‚Äôve only been that scared at two other times in my life (the night my mom died and when my daughter‚Äôs appendix burst - she ended up staying in the hospital for 5 days because she was running a high fever post surgery.) We ended up closing up the store and heading home instead of being in a place that had floor to ceiling windows all across the front. 

When I worked there, the Laser Disc industry was trying to take off. It‚Äôs so ironic that movies came out on discs that were 1/10th the size and now we can view movies digitally. ü§Ø"
EarthPorn,ff00kck,t3_er1a1c,1579463887.0,"We opted to do the tour of Secret Canyon instead of one of the Antelope Canyons due to concerns about the crowds. The tour we took was with Horseshoe Bend Canyon Tours. There was just 12 of us on the tour. We had to walk about .5 - .75 mile to get to the mouth of the canyon. It was VERY hot and I didn‚Äôt bring enough water. :( But, we were able to spend 45 minutes in the canyon, we were able to get a bunch of pics with no one else in them...it was just super relaxing and very enjoyable site to see. Highly recommend this. 

We also got to see a different perspective of Horseshoe Bend and didn‚Äôt have to endure the crowds."
ManagedByNarcissists,fegi9jf,t3_ep03bk,1579093613.0,"I so feel this. My NBoss‚Äô performance reviews were a freaking joke. They barely spent anytime going over it with us. Our performance reviews require the employee to fill out a 3 page long sheet of questions, etc. on how well we think we did our job over the past year. Then, the manager fills out their portion. My manager prior to NBoss would spend 1+ hours going over things. NBoss spent all of 10-15 minutes (or less) for my last review. I secretly recorded it. It was freaking ridiculous."
