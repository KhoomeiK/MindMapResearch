By retaining such tight control over this issue and putting so much importance and focus on food, you are teaching your children to be emotionally connected to eating and to use food to emotionally regulate. Food as something that makes Friday's 'special', regular food events where you get a vote, food as something dangerous that needs tight control in the form of a 'family policy', ritualistic behaviour where everyone has to do the same thing with certain food items... That's the path to disordered eating. Food should be emotionally neutral.

Quakers,f3nors8,t3_dhd6n3,1571000495.0,"I would say that Quakers believe in:

Peace
Compassionate love is at the centre of what it means to be human and 'what is of God in us'. All human life is of equal worth, and life is precious. Quaker belief in peace is active rather than passive, for example, Quakers may refuse military service and protest war.

Truth and integrity
Honesty and integrity is central to what is good in humanity. Sometimes it is hard to speak truth, particularly when people are in positions of power over us or when it would suit us to say something else, but we aspire to live a truthful life and to challenge dishonesty where we find it.

Simplicity and sustainability
Quakers are concerned about preserving and tending to our planet, ensuring our use of resources is sustainable and living simply with a conscious effort to find space for the things that really matter. 

The Quaker practice of stillness is part of living these values. It's a space for contemplation, for examining our lives, for searching for and sharing meaning that we find in that stillness. It is a 'doing' faith - we learn in the stillness and strive for personal growth.

Quaker faith is 'a search for truth rather than an arrival'. After initially being annoyed by your post, I realised the opportunity you gave me to consider what being a Quaker means and why it's important to me.

I really, really struggled with the hazard perception test because clicking at the right time was so difficult to achieve consistently for me.

Passed the practical test first time with one minor.

Looking back, I'm really grateful I changed to auto. I have now driven in situations I wouldn't have encountered before passing (four-six lane traffic, busy cities I'm not familiar with, sat nav being a useless biatch, having to lane change quite swiftly but also safely, reacting to dangerous drivers on the road) where I needed every bit of concentration to take in all of the different things that were happening. 

I know there is no way I would have enough spatial awareness in some circumstances you encounter while driving to be completely safe driving a manual car. Purely because the processing of so much spatial information can slow your reaction times, so having a glorified go cart is a HUGE benefit to acting quickly on that info.

You will definitely be able to drive. But you may need to put thought into what will make you a safe driver. For me it's automatic transmission, parking assistive technology, making sure I never need to take my attention from the road (no eating/drinking if I'm driving alone, no changing radio stations or playlists until I'm parked or have  pulled over into a layby, etc), not overtaking/pulling out at a junction unless I'm 100% sure even if that means I miss an opportunity and the twat behind me beeps, and not drinking whatsoever before driving (obvs I'm talking legal limits here, not driving over the limit hardly needs saying!).

BPD is caused by a number of factors, but the core factors that trigger developing this illness are environmental. That is what research and evidence-based treatment pathways suggest.

I actually didn't have a shit childhood, but I did experience abuse, as has almost every person with BPD.

Your reaction is a great example of why it could help people with BPD to rename the condition and recategorise it in line with other trauma related disorders such as PTSD.

We aren't monsters. BPD isn't a monster. And you aren't basically fucked, or destined to have sick children either. I'm sorry that you've been feeling that way and that your medical team have either encouraged you to feel hopeless or failed to dispel your fears about the diagnosis.

There is no 'cure' for BPD because there is no empirical way of testing for the absence of mental illness. The very concept of looking at mental health as cured/diseased or well/unwell is incorrect and unhelpful in my view (you can google ""mental health continuum model"" or PM me if you'd like to know more about looking at mental health as a spectrum instead). Difference, in itself, is not illness. It's about how it affects you.

If by 'cure' you mean functional recovery, feeling better, being in a situation where no symptoms are present, BPD is not ""incurable"". In fact, it is a good prognosis diagnosis. Unfortunately, it is also misunderstood and stigmatised."

There is no BPD gene. It's an illness that you can recover from, not a building block of who you are. There is no evidence (that I'm aware of) that someone without a genetic predisposition couldn't develop BPD, just as someone can develop cancer without a genetic predisposition towards it. 

Some people who are sexually abused don't develop a mental illness because they had a support system that helped them to process that abuse - positive, loving influences that helped them to avoid internalising blame, shame and self-hatred. Equally, some people who go on to develop BPD are not sexually abused in childhood but have experienced other forms of abuse."

Quakers,f1apoix,t3_d8f0wz,1569301781.0,"I think that sometimes, as people trying to live a set of beautiful but difficult-to-achieve values, Quakers can push themselves too hard towards acceptance. Even when that isn't actually appropriate for the situation.

It is completely understandable that you are feeling deeply betrayed and angry towards a predator who abused your trust. I am so sorry that you experienced this in a place where you should have been safe and supported.

It is similarly ok to feel betrayed by/negative towards your Quaker meeting if this issue isn't being addressed with the integrity that we all aspire to. A community that allows silence to address these issues, even when this comes from a good place of protecting family members from gossip/negative attention by association, creates an ideal environment for people who perpetrate abuse. Especially sexual abuse.

I encourage you to sit with the idea of not pushing yourself to find peace with this. It is ok not to be ok with this. It is ok to choose to find another meeting to attend.

Equally, while you are not responsible for your meeting's response to this situation, you are an equal part of that community. While you may feel that it's 'not your place', your feelings of betrayal and difficulty in attending meeting are valid and may be a valuable contribution to others, breaking the emerging 'culture of silence' around the harm that has happened. It is ok to share this if you feel called to and able to do so. As others have suggested, you may want to find a (F)friend to talk to first, and that's ok too.

AskUK,f1624ta,t3_d7t1zl,1569200847.0,"First of all, it's important to understand what CBT is and is not. It is not a panacea or a cutting edge therapy that's better than more traditional alternatives, but it has beneficial outcomes in some circumstances.

CBT is really effective when:
- You have a specific, measurable problem e.g. fear of flying
- You are mentally robust enough to limit your focus to working on that one area
- You are prepared to do the homework, worksheets, practice the exercises you are given ect rather than expecting change in the therapy room
- You are able to identify the thought patterns that are likely to trigger your unhelpful behaviours
- You are organised, logical, and benefit from models/diagrams when learning
- You can envision an end point to therapy (i.e. once I've gotten to x point, I'll be ok)

It is less likely to be effective when:
- You have a non-specific, enduring problem that is difficult to quantify e.g. recurrent depression
- You are vulnerable and need a therapist to guide you through change in a therapeutic setting
- You know you're not the sort of person who completes their homework/practices in between sessions
- You are creative, emotional, and benefit from discussion with someone that you trust, unpacking the issues verbally.
- You feel your issues are deap-seated and complex, and can't currently envision an end to therapy 

If you do feel CBT is for you, I'd recommend contacting CBT therapists in your area to request treatment via online/messaging. You may find that a number of people are happy to offer therapy via a different medium."

Even the best doctors occasionally miss something, and sometimes statistically unlikely events like symptoms being missed happen. Doctors are human too.

My Nanny did go to her doctor, and they told her she was just experiencing the usual symptoms of ageing. Nothing to worry about. She went again. Nope, you're all good. Really, stop worrying.

SIL1 was setting herself up to fail.

However, that is HER responsibility to deal with. If SIL1 was in treatment she'd be learning coping mechanisms to avoid this, as well as learning how to manage interpersonal communication and relationships more effectively.

Regarding Xmas, I would continue with whatever plans you had before receiving this email and simply disregard it. 

In terms of the family relationship as a whole though, as you asked for perspectives you may not have considered, it's worth knowing that the overwhelming majority of people with BPD are victims of childhood abuse that led to the development of maladaptive coping mechanisms.  

It may be worth having a deeper discussion with your husband about his anger, and whether this results from an abusive childhood. Especially with emotional abuse, it can take a long time to recognise that the way you were parented was abusive.

When I was suicidal, I never wanted to die. I just wanted the pain to end. Once I got to the point where I 'knew' that not only would I be better off, but my loved ones would also suffer less because they wouldn't have to see me go through this pain and anguish any more, suicide seemed not only preferable but sensible.

When I started to get help, it was to placate my partner. If engaging with the crisis team would make him feel like he'd done everything he could once I was gone, why not give him that comfort? They couldn't stop this torment, so I'd still kill myself, just not today.

I didn't realise then but that 'just not today' was everything. Days passed of 'not today, I can wait'. Slow, painful days, but days where I was talking to the crisis team, and psychiatrist, and family and friends. One day I went to bed and realised that I hadn't actively made a decision that day not to kill myself, I just... hadn't. The pain was still there, but it wasn't unbearable.

There months later I found a therapist. Four months later I went back to work. Six months later something tragic happened and I held it together. 

I still have bad days, but I'm no longer suicidal.

- Let him know you want to have a serious conversation with him about something that's been bothering you.
- Approach the subject calmly.
- Tell him that women and men are equal, and that his comments on your clothing choices are making you seriously question whether you have a future together.
- Tell him that he is welcome to give an opinion when you ask for it, but not otherwise, and that your opinion will always supercede his in this matter.
- Be clear that you found his behaviour about the dress you wore to work to be disrespectful, and that you won't accept any further instances of him putting his feelings above your bodily autonomy.
- Ask how he feels about things like #metoo and everyday sexism. Describe your own experiences and those of other women in your life. 

Listen carefully to what he says in return. Is he respectful? Does he believe you when you talk about your experiences? Is he willing to have this conversation, or does he get angry/sulk/guilt trip/gaslight?

Anyway, to answer your questions (and this applies to all workplaces I have had where there were staff of different genders):

1. Yes. 

2. Yes.

3. Yes, daily.

4. No, because it's a risky course of action that is also unlikely to help them.

5. Yes, I discuss it online because I'm a sucker for punishment (and in my better moments, believe that educating people about equality is going to change things - every droplet is part of the ocean, and changing the mind of one person is to change the world).

No, I don't find online discussions help to bring resolution, as gender inequality is a systemic issue and not one that individual women can resolve. Educating the people who make decisions and hold power in a business can result in organisational culture change, but many people who experience toxic masculinity are not in a position to influence leaders/managers.

Online discussions tend to either be talking in an echo chamber of other women who experience the same things and are already well aware of privilege, bias, etc, or devolve into being attacked by trolls who are determined, regardless of the different kinds of proof you put in front of them, to see the world as a place where everyone has equity already.

relationships,eyym0bt,t3_czdwdc,1567594047.0,"As someone who went through the same thing and is now married to her 'John', I remember how confusing and scary it was to develop feelings for  a man.

As a lesbian, you've probably faced the whole 'but you're so pretty!' 'you just need to find the right man!' thing that comes with living in a heteronormative world. Equally, you've probably joked about how deluded those people are. Perhaps you've referred to yourself or others as 'gold star' lesbians. 

Now, you probably feel guilty and ashamed - you're proving the bigots right! You're betraying the sisterhood, and everything the LGBTQ community stands for! How can you go from 'I was born this way' to 'raining men' seemingly overnight?! You've never identified as bi and it doesn't feel right!

Deep breath.

First of all, ignore all of the people who will now congratulate you for being bisexual. They don't get to decide that. If you want to identify as queer, or homoflexible, or even just as a very bad lesbian, or lesbian with a 'John' exception, that is your call. Not theirs. And if it makes other people uncomfortable that you don't fit into their boxes, that's their problem. You are not betraying the LGBTQ community by not using labels that don't fit with your sexual orientation.

Secondly, take it slow with this guy. People choose not to enter relationships for all sorts of reasons. If on reflection you feel that the potential for damaging your sense of self,ccommunity and belonging, possibly your friendships, is not worth the experiment, that's a valid choice. Equally, if you feel like you want to see where this goes no one has the right to judge you. Listen to your gut, and communicate with 'John' about how you feel. If you're not feeling it down the line, don't let guilt or caring about someone deeply but non-sexually keep you in a relationship that is ultimately unfulfilling.

Thirdly, give yourself a break. You are not a one woman pride flag with the responsibility of proving bigots wrong. Just because someone with an axe to grind would interpret this as evidence we can all be ""saved"" doesn't mean they're right. Don't let the opinions of others control you.

Last but not least, make sure that 'John' knows your sexual orientation will always be there and you are who you are. If he has a problem with you mentioning ex girlfriends in front of his family, your continued involvement in LGBT life, or gets weird when you join in a discussion about how hot Salma Hayek was in From Dusk Til Dawn, this isn't going to work out.

Talk to your fiance. Not just about how that conversation made you feel, but about how he acts around his friend. It's ok to expect to be the priority in your SO's life and to be open about how you want to be treated.

- How could he change to make you feel more valued? 
- What are you uncomfortable about in terms of this friendship and what would you like him to do? (Note, this should be the beginning point for a discussion not an ultimatum)
