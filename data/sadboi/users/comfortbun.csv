there is no humane way to kill a sentient being who wants to live. have you ever seen a dog or cat sit still while being kicked? the same applies with all beings. all animals run from pain. that alone should indicate that they aren‚Äôt emotionless beings waiting for their turn on the kill floor. humane slaughter is a phrase used to make the consumer feel better about what they are buying. i‚Äôm guessing you eat meat with the arguments you‚Äôre making. you are speaking as if you aren‚Äôt contributing to their pain with your own purchases."

EDAnonymous,fgr810h,t1_fgr7jie,1581040411.0,"the coffee we usually have to offer is blonde, pike, and dark. they each have a distinct taste based on the type of coffee that is available on that day. pike is smooth, blonde is sweet and mellow, and dark is bold and rich (at least that‚Äôs how we‚Äôre told to describe them lol). this kind of coffee is comparable to the instant coffee that you make at home. 

americanos are different. they consist of raw espresso shots and hot water. you can add milk in there if you‚Äôd prefer but what i think you‚Äôre looking for is drip coffee. 

your options are essentially: ‚Äúcan i please have a tall pike/dark/blonde in a grande cup‚Äù or ‚Äúcan i please have a (insert size here) pike/dark/blonde with extra room for milk‚Äù. if you want non dairy just say ‚Äúcan you add a bit of almond/soy/coconut in there as well‚Äù. this can be described as a ‚Äúsplash‚Äù which you usually won‚Äôt be charged for, or ‚Äúto the top‚Äù, etc etc. 

they also have some great flavorings if you like those :> syrups are usually 20cal per pump. we offer skinny syrups as well- sugar free cinnamon dolce and sugar free vanilla, both 0cal, and skinny mocha, which is arnd 5cal per pump compared to the 25cal for regular mocha pumps. personally i don‚Äôt like any of them bc they have that distinct chemical taste, but it‚Äôs an option for you if you‚Äôd like to try.

EDAnonymous,fgq1iuj,t3_ezx01l,1581016102.0,"first off, are you looking for a drink with espresso shots or straight up drip coffee? starbucks offers both, but i would assume you mean drop coffee as you are filling the cup 2/3 of the way. 

second, is it cold milk or steamed? if it‚Äôs cold milk, you could ask the person on the register to fill whatever size cup you‚Äôd like 2/3 of the way, or you can just say extra room. sometimes customers ask for a tall coffee in a grande cup for that extra space. there will usually be a condiment bar with milk and sugar so you can do that step on your own. you‚Äôll have to ask for them to put non dairy milk in tho, we usually stock the condiment bar with half and half, whole, and nonfat only

steamed milk is a different story though. you‚Äôd have to ask for a misto and specify what kind of milk you would like steamed. hope this makes sense ;_; we are trained to value customer satisfaction first and foremost so ask your barista any questions you might have."
