their treatment doesn’t compare to [the torment](https://www.dominionmovement.com/watch) that farmed animals suffer through on a daily basis. they exist solely for profit and greed. imagine being born into this world for the mere purpose of being killed. someone superior to you has already planned out your death months in advance. you don’t get to frolic, you don’t get to experience free will. that is essentially the life of a pig. 

there is no humane way to kill a sentient being who wants to live. have you ever seen a dog or cat sit still while being kicked? the same applies with all beings. all animals run from pain. that alone should indicate that they aren’t emotionless beings waiting for their turn on the kill floor. humane slaughter is a phrase used to make the consumer feel better about what they are buying. i’m guessing you eat meat with the arguments you’re making. you are speaking as if you aren’t contributing to their pain with your own purchases."

EDAnonymous,fgr810h,t1_fgr7jie,1581040411.0,"the coffee we usually have to offer is blonde, pike, and dark. they each have a distinct taste based on the type of coffee that is available on that day. pike is smooth, blonde is sweet and mellow, and dark is bold and rich (at least that’s how we’re told to describe them lol). this kind of coffee is comparable to the instant coffee that you make at home. 

americanos are different. they consist of raw espresso shots and hot water. you can add milk in there if you’d prefer but what i think you’re looking for is drip coffee. 

your options are essentially: “can i please have a tall pike/dark/blonde in a grande cup” or “can i please have a (insert size here) pike/dark/blonde with extra room for milk”. if you want non dairy just say “can you add a bit of almond/soy/coconut in there as well”. this can be described as a “splash” which you usually won’t be charged for, or “to the top”, etc etc. 

they also have some great flavorings if you like those :> syrups are usually 20cal per pump. we offer skinny syrups as well- sugar free cinnamon dolce and sugar free vanilla, both 0cal, and skinny mocha, which is arnd 5cal per pump compared to the 25cal for regular mocha pumps. personally i don’t like any of them bc they have that distinct chemical taste, but it’s an option for you if you’d like to try. 

don’t b afraid to experiment with type of coffee, flavoring, etc etc. it can take a bit of time to get used to starbucks lingo but i think their options are yum and worth it"

EDAnonymous,fgq1iuj,t3_ezx01l,1581016102.0,"first off, are you looking for a drink with espresso shots or straight up drip coffee? starbucks offers both, but i would assume you mean drop coffee as you are filling the cup 2/3 of the way. 

second, is it cold milk or steamed? if it’s cold milk, you could ask the person on the register to fill whatever size cup you’d like 2/3 of the way, or you can just say extra room. sometimes customers ask for a tall coffee in a grande cup for that extra space. there will usually be a condiment bar with milk and sugar so you can do that step on your own. you’ll have to ask for them to put non dairy milk in tho, we usually stock the condiment bar with half and half, whole, and nonfat only

steamed milk is a different story though. you’d have to ask for a misto and specify what kind of milk you would like steamed. hope this makes sense ;_; we are trained to value customer satisfaction first and foremost so ask your barista any questions you might have."
