OP doesn't have time constraints, there isn't a deadline to finish the car as far as i'm aware, maybe listening to your daughter and validating what she says instead of focusing on proving her wrong and asserting your superiority would go over better. 

Explain to her ""thats a great idea/thought"" then explain to her why you prefer the way that you are doing it. Instead of ""that wrong/doesn't work"" then laundry list. 

I get the feeling that from her point of view, you just tell her that she is wrong all of the time and then it becomes a fight about who is right. You are the adult, you don't need to prove yourself to a child. Find whats right in her statements and then build on that."

I have vivid memories of scrubbing the bathroom while they where sitting on their asses watching TV, when I was done they would be like ""great but what about X room"" they would just keep moving the goal post.
