Anxiety,fj0ds8g,t1_fizkq6o,1582897440.0,"I've put on about 10 pounds since I started, but that's from some combination of exercising less, different diet, more traveling, and the meds."
Anxiety,f8glkxw,t3_e0q0s1,1574561550.0,"At the risk of taking /u/gemini725 's comment, changing a word or two, and calling it my own, don't lose sight of your own accomplishments. It's very easy to do, and even easier to assume your peers are doing bigger/better/more things. This is something I struggle with every day, but it's gotten a lot better for me over the past few years because I've started to do a couple different things:

* every Sunday, I write down in a journal 3 things I'm proud I accomplished since the last time I wrote. It can be anything from saying hello to a stranger, giving a presentation at work, calming myself down during a panic attack, telling someone close to me I love them, only snoozing my alarm once instead of two or three times, etc. Doesn't really matter what it is, as long as I acknowledge that I accomplished something and can allow myself to be proud that I did it.
* each time I do something, I take a second to pause before I do the next thing and appreciate the feeling of accomplishment, however small. I (literally) pat myself on the back every time I cross a line off a to-do list at work, smile at myself after I brush my teeth, little stuff like that. It makes the day so much better.

I don't want to suggest that I have this all figured out, or that this is a one-size-fits-all solution, but I hope this gives you some context on how you might try to reframe those feelings when they come around again."
Anxiety,f8ghtnv,t3_e0q7x8,1574559918.0,"I dunno if it helps at all, but you might be surprised how many other guys feel similarly and/or feel they struggle with girls in general. It calls for some vulnerability on your side, and the uncertainty that goes with it. 

To be honest, I don't think there is a ""right answer"" to this. My best advice based on what you've said is, the next time a girl shows interest, go along with it! Be playful and have fun with it. If it crashes and burns and it turns out she doesn't actually have interest, dust yourself off and try again with the next one; you will already know what the missed connection feels like, so it won't be as bad next time."
Anxiety,f3aarj1,t3_dg8pzs,1570766420.0,"I think I can relate. I avoid medication in general as much as I can and have some distrust of anxiety and depression/mind-altering meds because I want to know how they'll make me feel before I take them. Not sure what med you have or are considering taking, but I'd guess you aren't the first person to take this particular medication (I hope that doesn't sound mean or off-putting, just want to convey that you're not a lab experiment with something brand new). Your doctor likely recommended it to you because they've seen it help other patients with similar symptoms/experiences. It doesn't necessarily make it easier from an emotional perspective, but if you can get to the mindset of - this is something that will help me, not hurt me - you might feel a little more comfortable. Also if you can and it makes you feel better, maybe see if you can hang with a friend or family member the day you take it the first time. That helped me a ton when I started with my anti-depressant a month or so ago."
Anxiety,f33av5w,t3_dek2lo,1570635115.0,I wouldn't call this a step. This is a GIANT LEAP in the right direction. I'm proud of you.
Anxiety,f3217hm,t3_df8edh,1570590356.0,"So happy to hear it's working for you! I started Lexapro about a month ago myself, am taking 15mg. Drastic improvement from before taking meds. Therapy has also helped tremendously but gotta believe the medication is having a strong impact too."
indieheads,f1n0xdh,t3_da3cso,1569606460.0,Was/is there anything during your bouts with depression that you could/can focus on to pull you out of your place of darkness?
