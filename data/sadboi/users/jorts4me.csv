dryalcoholics,fpgijpe,t1_fpgelpa,1588603403.0,"Not well. Ended up having somewhat of a breakdown, left my job of almost 11 years among other things.

mentalhealth,fpg4n9e,t3_gd22ts,1588594117.0,"I cry pretty easily sometimes, well - more than as a guy I think I should (stereotypes right?). There are a lot of times I can and do hold it in, but I think that contributes to it being a little worse when it does finally happen. I don't know. I cried in front of my boss at least 3-4 times if not more and just felt so damn weak.

I'm a super emotional person all around to be honest. A while back I ran across something online where they describe some people as a Highly Sensitive Person and reading about that I was like ""Yep, that's me"". It is so absolutely draining and tiring. I think it's part of the reason I started to isolate more and more over the years."
dryalcoholics,fpg3c16,t1_fp3ws8b,1588592969.0,"Yeah. I've had about 1.5 years sober but had a lot of issues with psych meds that I was prescribed (bad side effects, or just plain not working). That whole experience with the doctors and meds was such an ordeal/frustrating. Then lost job/health insurance.

I know alcohol isn't the cure, but it's definitely made me think it at least eases the pain for a little while... then of course I realize the pain comes back tenfold after (then some, considering the physical effects)."
dryalcoholics,fpg2wwu,t1_fp2ved0,1588592593.0,"Depression, anxiety. Overall I just hate my life, and despite my best efforts see no way out. Passively suicidal for years. Haven't been told a formal diagnosis by any of the professionals I went to and apparently I was too stupid to ask. Right before all the virus shit broke out I had started seeing a social worker again and they were again recommending I see a psychiatrist but given my past experience with that and the meds I really didn't want to.

I'm familiar with the Sinclair method, but never really looked into doing that myself. Guess I've partly thought it wouldn't help much since I've never really been an every day drinker. I'd usually go a week or two and then binge drink. Longest time sober I've had is about a year and a half."

And then, should you be in a place where you feel you can share and get support, be wary of expressing how truly hopeless you are or if you're having suicidal ideations. It takes a lot for me to get to that point, but I was even encouraged to share. But then - oh you're continuously feeling hopeless/wishing for death? Then it's just ""Get help"" or ""Call the hotline""...

I've been trying to get help for bloody years! I've been put on a multitude of medications (that don't work and some with pretty bad side effects) and gone through tons of talk therapy. Meditate? You bet. Journal? Of course. Exercise? Yes indeed.

I have tried and tried and explained that I've tried and then not only am I just met with empty words, I'm abandoned and made a pariah in a support group scenario where I would expect people to be understanding and validating.

I really don't want to feel anger/resentment over that but how can I not? It's like being kicked when you're down. I would never do that to someone, hell I have never done that to someone. I've had people call/come to me in similar situations, even calling and waking me up at 2-3 AM in the morning and while I necessarily may not be able to directly help I provided a listening ear. I validated and supported.

Fuck."
SuicideWatch,faagqcs,t3_e8839b,1575908582.0,"I feel the same way, so much. I wish I could end this pain, but I'm forced to keep living it because I can't do that to my family.

Been trying to get help for a while now, to no avail so far unfortunately. I have a good day or two every once in a long while then it's back into the pits. Hopefully something will work or click along the way for us."
mentalhealth,faa8u8h,t3_e85b72,1575905092.0,"This aspect is literally killing me. I need help, having to wait does fucking nothing but make it worse.

I'm about to the point of giving up to be honest, not like all of the medications they've tried to throw at me or therapy over all the time I've been trying to get help has done much good anyway."

Actually started socializing more and stuff too, but despite it all still was suffering with intense self-hatred/confidence/esteem issues.

Ended up gaining most of it back, isolating more than ever and life in general somehow managed to get even worse. I'm an absolute wreck of a person.

I hope you find what you're looking for in life that will bring you peace, happiness and contentment."
mentalhealth,f6nkgg5,t3_ds232v,1572993485.0,"I can somewhat relate. Due to ongoing/worsening mental health stuff I've not been doing so well on the eating, caving to cravings/eating junk food and crap as ""comfort"". While it feels/tastes good in the moment obviously I end up hating myself even more after the fact. Especially since a while back I had done so well and lost a bunch of weight but now I've gained most of it back.

Just started back trying to eat properly but it's been a struggle. Hopefully I can get back to exercising in some capacity too.

Best wishes to you and I hope you find some peace with your eating habits in however that may be. Hating yourself sucks :("
kratom,f6iexb6,t3_drcdi8,1572877359.0,"I can only give you my experience, though it's rather limited as I only recently started taking kratom (about 4 weeks ago). My alcohol consumption had become an issue as I would binge to try to self-medicate for depression/anxiety and the like. Obviously that has taken a toll over the years, some legal issues and physically of course.

Personally, kratom has helped a TON over all with my cravings. I really have not had any desire to drink to excess let alone at all to be honest. I use a scale to measure the kratom, most I've taken in a dose was 8g and that was a bit overpowering for me. Definitely made me uncomfortable, nausea, etc. but I also had a good amount of caffeine so that could have been playing a part. Typically I will take only 3g and see how I feel and take a little more if needed, only up to 6g and I haven't had any more issues with nausea or the like.

I have not experienced any constipation issues, granted I have not taken kratom every day except for couple times where I took it 2 days in a row. Given the experience I've had so far as relates to kratom helping the alcohol cravings and I've definitely noticed help with regards to anxiety as well, I'm going to keep taking it as needed and monitor how things go.

That said, I guess I would say - start with low dose, measuring it out certainly wouldn't hurt so at least you could know if any unpleasantness is due to the amount. For me personally after I take it, I found it takes about 30-45 minutes to notice if there is an effect. I also try to limit caffeine as that has been problematic for me when I've taken kratom. Good luck, hope it helps or you find something that works for you!"
SuicideWatch,f4hluil,t3_dkkhlt,1571593077.0,"Sorry you are/have been going through that. I relate a lot with all you have said. Very similar circumstances here. There's also been some other circumstances that have completely been salt in the wound. I keep looking/reaching for anything but nothing is there.

I'm so broken. Strongly considering getting some scotch and at least try to enjoy something even if it's super short lived."
mentalhealth,f45b0t0,t3_djcxnm,1571370828.0,"I bottled things up and pretended to be positive for many years, until I finally reached a point I couldn't do it any longer. Had a breakdown I guess, I've been a wreck ever since.

That's not to say I think there's anything wrong with being positive but I do think its fairly nuanced in how you approach it and practice it in day to day life. In other words, don't ""pretend"" - I think alone having that concept in your mind is an issue. I would posit maybe find the areas and things where you can truly be positive, and express gratitude there and use that to build momentum?

Sorry, I'm just kinda working through this type of stuff in my own head a lot recently and the post made me think out loud a bit. I think suffering and negative things are always there, its a fact of life. Its more how we react or acknowledge or allow those things to stay with us in the long term."

As someone who is/has always struggled similarly with what the OP has said, the above kinda made me do a double-take. I've certainly done that.

How to give myself love is something I've been mulling over for quite some time. It's definitely something discussed when I went to group therapy, and a bit during one on one but I always felt it impossible or almost silly to do or try."
