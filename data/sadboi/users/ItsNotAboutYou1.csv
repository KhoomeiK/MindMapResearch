Ask they could have PTSD that shows up in other forms.. for me I never had flash backs my brain and body just went numb and shut down"
ptsd,fg6p86y,t3_ex0xea,1580573704.0,"I’ve done two sessions of EMDR and so far they are helping for me. I have CPTSD from narcissistic abuse and neglect as well as 1 trauma event where someone tried to kill me 10 years ago. 

Before EMDR I did hypnotherapy for the narc abuse and was able to process a lot but ultimately have found EMDR to be more helpful. That being said my healing journey has been awful. 

Since starting EMDR and body work for this I am having digestive issues, trouble sleeping and so many aches and pains... and that means it’s working. (If you have a chance read the body keeps the score)

I had completely disassociated from my body and also constant CPTSD/PTSD flash back is basically like a morphine dose for your body so I was not feeling any of these things."
