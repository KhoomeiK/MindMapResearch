Teachers,fiwakds,t1_fiv1np4,1582779513.0,"Last year, I was having a lot of issues with a few kids in one of my classes. After trying tons of things that had worked for other kids, and getting some support/ideas from colleagues, I finally went to admin to ask for help. I was told that if I ""actually cared about the students, they wouldn't act like this.""

I legitimately have PTSD from that school."
EnglishLearning,fgfff7l,t3_ey2bf1,1580737160.0,"Technically, no, it doesn't have an independent clause. In informal English, it's not uncommon to have a sentence like this, but it's really a continuation of the sentence before (I assume)."

PlusSize,f4afhqx,t3_djz83n,1571494151.0,"I know you said you hate camis, and I used to as well, but I discovered that the cheap Time and Tru (?) camis at Walmart are the bomb! They're like $1-2, come in lots of colors, are a nice soft and stretchy fabric, and, most importantly, are long AF! Long like ""I have a decent gut and they land halfway down my butt and stay there"" kind of long."

AskReddit,ew8a1tw,t1_ew87bd7,1565206351.0,"I think this is more shock or adrenaline than anything. If you're still able to react, you didn't freeze.

When I was in a car accident, I was able to calmly make sure my cat was okay and put her in her carrier, find my phone, get out, call my parents, and call 911. It wasn't until after I'd been checked by paramedics and such that the shock wore off and I cried. I didn't even feel pain from my injuries until later that night.

I think it's connected to the fight/flight/freeze as it allows us to get ourselves out of crisis without worrying about pain or panic."
AskReddit,ew89fvw,t1_ew87vgc,1565205995.0,"We practiced by creating and practicing these situations in our class. We'd practice walking and one of the volunteers would come up behind us and grab us or something, so we'd have to yell no. You could probably practice with a friend or partner, as long as you were careful about not physically harming the other person.

We just had to do it over and over until we didn't feel so self-conscious about yelling."
AskReddit,ew7y6m5,t1_ew7ltg3,1565199571.0,"This is actually something we covered a LOT in the self-defense class I took. One of the techniques I remember is yelling ""no!"" right away, whenever something happens. This kind of breaks through the instinct to freeze, making it more reliable for you to react. It's something we practiced over and over."
TalesFromTheCustomer,evd88zs,t1_evchg0m,1564432307.0,"Ugh. I ordered a piece of gluten free cake from a restaurant one year on my birthday. I asked if there were ANY tree nut products in the cake, as I had a severe allergy. The server checked with the kitchen and assured me that there were no nuts in the cake. I took one bite and immediately knew it was almond flour.
Thank goodness I always have a fuck ton of benadryl and my epipen on me."
TrollXChromosomes,evcjown,t1_evbu0o1,1564416758.0,"Honestly, tell your therapist that. I was struggling with really bad suicidal thoughts earlier this year and I told my therapist that I was struggling with them, but I was also incredibly anxious that I would end up inpatient and told her that I thought that would make things worse.
She was really understanding and we made a plan for what I'd do if I felt like I got to the point that I may do something.
Keep your therapist in the loop. They can help so much more if you're just open with them.
Assuming you have a decent therapist, I guess. I've definitely had therapists that I didn't feel comfortable telling much at all."
ChronicPain,ev2ym4i,t1_ev2wybe,1564186021.0,I'm so sorry; you've been on quite the ride. You are so incredibly strong to have been through all you've been through and to keep going. I truly hope things start going your way soon.
BlackPeopleTwitter,ev2k8wn,t1_ev1couv,1564178488.0,"I'm really glad you mentioned analogies, haha. As a teacher, I worry I use way too many analogies, but it helps me understand things so I've hoped it helps others look at things differently too!"
ChronicPain,ev1ms75,t1_euzslo2,1564161529.0,"I think it is also scary to people that they might be thin/fit and still end up with a disability. It gives people a sense of control like ""okay that won't happen to me as long as I don't get fat,"" which is unfortunately not the case. Humans really like to think that things can't happen to them."

relationships,epsl4ns,t3_bvo6nq,1559453195.0,"I want to offer my opinion here because I was the ""friend"" 6ish years ago. I had fairly shitty self-esteem and I let things go further than I wanted to. 
That being said, I still think about the girlfriend (she's STILL with him, to the best of my knowledge) and, even though I don't know her, I wish she'd leave him and find someone better. I wasn't the only girl he fucked around with. I cut him out of my life when I found out there were other girls before me (all while he was with her) and I realized how emotionally abusive he was being to me and his girlfriend.
Please don't let him treat you like this. You deserve so much better, and I promise you that better is out there."
