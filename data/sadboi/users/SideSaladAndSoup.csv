If you don't feel comfortable with it, please don't feel like you need to do it.

Having said that, working on your anxiety and being more comfortable with people might be a better goal than losing your virginity. For me, a combination of therapy, working out, new hobbies, cutting out negative influences, dealing with a ton of unchecked personal stuff from my childhood helped me deal with a ton of the anxious/depressive behaviors. I realize it is a cliche to say ""work on you first"", but it really helps. Once I was more comfortable with me, I felt better about putting myself out there. I'm still not entirely comfortable with myself and there's definitely going to be situations I'm not going to do well in. Hell, I'm happier not pursuing sexual relationships.

I think there are subreddits geared towards stopping smoking weed, but for me, whenever I wanted to not be sober, I would use meditation apps to get my mind off of it and try to be comfortable in the moment. Maybe that could work for you?

Also, don't think that you will be always confined to your degree. I'd encourage you to get a degree in something that can land you jobs, but the market pooped when I graduated and ended up getting hired in a different field.

I used this technique to stop more obsessive compulsive behaviors, but I'm thinking this could have helped me back when I was really suppressing EVERYTHING. Otherwise, hobbies, finding friends that make you feel okay the way you are, setting personal goals that make you feel like you're improving something, etc are all good as well.

DecidingToBeBetter,eyip3dg,t1_ey5aqal,1567105485.0,"To add on to this, going back and working through childhood issues did end up helping me realize that there was repressed trauma that had affected the rest of my development. Being able to talk about this has definitely helped me break out of my funk

I'm still bitter that it took this long, but baby steps. I'll get there in time"
DecidingToBeBetter,eyii2z9,t3_cqhv9a,1567102752.0,"I see some great ideas here already, but what works for me was not breaking up directly, but making new friends and reaching out. This allowed me to branch out, so when i really stopped talking to people, it felt like a good transition"

selfimprovement,eydz5hp,t3_cwoqw3,1567026635.0,"I was comfortable in my life, but recently realised that I need to move on in many ways. I started by making a list of things and how I would like them to change by setting small goals. For example, i have what could be considered a good job, but it's kinda making me die inside. By setting small goals, ""find a new job"" turns into ""work on resume"", then ""reach out to potential references"" then ""do applications"". It makes me feel like I'm accomplishing stuff,while also not allowing myself to feel stuck"
