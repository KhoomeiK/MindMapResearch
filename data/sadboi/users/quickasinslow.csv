BPD,eus45uw,t3_ch8g16,1564003008.0,"I see them in my peripherals every now and then and feel them. Most the time I believe it’s from a lack of sleep or drug use making me hallucinate. But sometimes I feel like I see them when I’m sober and rested or see blurs of images in the corners, not only bugs."
BPD,eurud49,t3_ch80xi,1563999073.0,"I feel this 100%. I always feel like I do everything for my best friend and I try to not hold things over his head that I provide for him without him asking. But the problem is he never actually asks for help rather he’s someone I care about and I’m going to provide for him regardless. But when t comes to a favor or something simple that he an physically do for me, he refuses and his excuse to not doing anything for me is because he just doesn’t want to. Like, he has the mentality that the things that I do for him force the expectation of him doing something for me so he turns stubborn. But isn’t that what friends are suppose to do? Return favors and support? 

Not only that, but any other friends that I might go out with are always talking openly about their problems or getting upset or in some situation that I’m obviously going to help them with because I’m their friend. The only problem is that can be mentally and physically exhausting. I don’t usually go out and talk openly about my issues so I understand if people don’t have the opportunity to be there the same way for me because I don’t always give it. But always being there for others and forgetting my daily mental struggles is frustrating and tiring. But at the same time I feel a little selfish for thinking that or scared of people running out of my life."
