She also has been taking a break since the whole Trisha thing, but as I said she made it clear that it is not the Trisha thing alone since she had recently moved, formed a new alter, having a long distance relationship and by the looks of it, it was the doing of a persecutor.

As someone who had loved Trisha she really is handling this situation with poor taste and is already in another online scandal. She has already dropped the statement that she was 'n a gay trans man and looks like she is getting over this statement as well very quickly.

I had also watched a video made by her ex gf who is also a educational channel who was very shocked at the news and really hurt by all trishas insensitive statements and what not.

Didrama,fn1xywt,t3_fyo4d9,1586572832.0,"I had followed both DisociaDID and Trisha paytas, but Trisha really has a way of offending people. If you follow her you can realize that she doesn't really have frequent disassociation, which is a trait that must be frequent when diagnosed, she does multiple multiple videos edited and long, like one to two hour long, she's on podcasts and other videos. 

I truly want to believe her, but seemingly not showing one single trait of DID for 10 years. I'm inclined to think that she has multiple traumatic experiences, thus believing she has DID, but there are more fitting diagnoses for her mannerisms. 

Currently studying psychology and had binge watched all of dissociaDID videos, who educates on this subject with much preperationa and researches and adds the sources from educational websites. She works hard to remove the stigmas surrounding the disorder while Trish diminishes and discards that.

Trish had said that she feels like a gay trans man in a woman's body, which one could argue is either trolling or an alter. Idk. I just know that what she doing isn't mature for someone who's had so much time to grow and learn from internet dramas."
Didrama,fn1wgdp,t1_fn1ewsq,1586571761.0,"Unfortunately DissosiaDID recently underwent a suicide attempt in their system and I'm sure the whole Trisha thing (not the sole reason, but a contributer to it) was one of the reasons. 

trishas videos were very violent and had triggered people with ptsd because they didn't necessarily have a screen to protect them last time someone lurched at them. 

she then continued to say that Nin and her co-alters were faking it and that Anthony (the guy that tried to educate people with concrete facts not mere misinformation) was exploitative and an asshole which he truly isn't. 

She is preventing newly diagnosed DID patients who are scared and nervous about this disorder (among other things) and are afraid to tell people what is really their reality because they are afraid that people might handle the situation like this. 

She is just handling this like someone desperately seeking attention, getting it and not caring what serious implications she can cause in someone's life. If you watch DisociaDID you'll see that they're really wonderful people and really want to educate people what DID really looks like, so this whole Trisha thing is more damaging than the few followers they might have gained, it's impossible to hide these sort of things when so heavily traumatized.

Damn, I just really hate to see Trisha mistreating the opportunity to reach out for help since she truly needs it."
