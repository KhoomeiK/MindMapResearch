Medical school is very difficult so maybe he’s releasing some insecurity about his own competence in the program on you? Maybe he wants to feel smarter and more in control and is doing this at your expense? (Although he certainly doesn’t sound smart!)

He could have an actual trauma that is unexplored and is unable to talk about it. 

Maybe he’s genuinely interested in psych and is trying to dismiss or minimize his interests?"

My littlest niece kept going into the photo booth by herself and posing with the funniest signs not knowing what they said. 

When my husband and I had our first dance my nephew piped up, “Why are you just dancing in circles?” Totally cracked me up! 

We also had a great photo with my grandmother, aunts, cousins, nieces and nephew so there were four generations in one photo. She’s 97 so to have a picture of her holding the newest baby was so cool.

worldnews,fo0na9o,t1_fo05uhu,1587416192.0,"1. Happy cake day! 

2. This 100%. I am not a Trump supporter but the WHO is supposed to be an unbiased global organization. Positing that they need to be policed to prevent corruption is ridiculous. They shouldn’t be corruptible if they’re truly functioning as intended and their real goal is world health. 

3. This removes all culpability from Tedros who acted irresponsibly and recommended to keep air travel to China open as late as February, well after Covid-19 was raging in Wuhan.

4. This also exonerates China of blame who are purported to have corrupted the WHO as well as covering up the outbreak until it was too late to be contained. Make no mistake - this did NOT have to become a pandemic. The deaths that are occurring were preventable if China had been forthcoming and taken swift action to contain it earlier. 

Notably, China was criticized in 2003 for covering up and slow action in the original SARS epidemic. However the WHO was much more actively involved in monitoring the epidemic as well as China’s attempts to contain it. 

This time around the WHO was extremely hands off from the time that reports were coming out in the news and social media from China about Covid. To put it context, the WHO pressed China for information as early as December 2002 even though China didn’t formally inform the WHO of the outbreak until February 2003. Despite the fact that this Covid-19 outbreak escalated much more quickly and videos of aggressive containment attempts by the Chinese government continued to be posted on social media, **the WHO was still recommending ongoing international travel to China in February 2020!**

I don’t understand why people don’t see how awful that leadership is. 

Yes, Trump is doing an awful job. 

 But the director general of our global health organization fucked up royally and is not receiving reasonable scrutiny and culpability for his many errors in navigating this. 
Thousands of people are dying needlessly because of his mistakes.

For Vice to focus so exclusively on Trump is disingenuous and wrong. Tedros should apologize and resign."
