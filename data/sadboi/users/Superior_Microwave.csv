depression,exha5ds,t3_cspmcx,1566298492.0,"Yeah,i get that. Like i physically can't kill myself, but i just don't want to be here, like i just want a release from all this pain. Tbh its kinda like if i saw a car moving towards me i wouldn't get out of the way. Which is strange to think about. 

I feel that is i wasn't present, things would just be so much easier..yet I'm too afraid to do anything about it incase i fail."
depression,exh9zfc,t3_cshoh6,1566298300.0,"I understand that feeling, if i feel the brief bit of happiness i feel like anything i ever felt before was a lie, or even that the happiness is fake. It kinda leaves me stuck in a vicious cycle of self doubt."

AskReddit,ertr0u3,t3_c3q0f5,1561250610.0,"My 9th birthday. It was good I had family round,everything was going well. And then all of a sudden my stomach starts hurting a little. I pass it off as eating too much cake like anyone would on a birthday. Then it gets much worse. Minutes pass with the pain increasing. After an hour of subtle but noticeable pain it gets excruciating. To the point where I collapsed, turns out I had some type of infection in either my kidney or liver..can't really remember. But as a child thinking you were gonna die on your birthday was tragic man"
depression,ertqh33,t3_c3sx8x,1561250128.0,Yeah pretty much. Everything is just a massive struggle. Its the main reason why I'm always so tired. Even though I physically don't really do anything. My mind is constantly fighting itself. Normal tasks like getting up and making a meal is tiring. I just wanna be okay
depression,erqv6i7,t1_erquy97,1561152876.0,"I'm very prone to over thinking, I always seem to. 
I have insomnia mixed with ptsd so I really struggle to get to sleep. 
If I'm honest I'm not sure if he truly wants to hear it. I feel like I'm constantly bothering him, or it just bores him. Idk.

My family doesn't really help the matter though to be honest"
depression,erqucj5,t1_erqu3kp,1561152274.0,I've just started camhs not long ago. So just talking at the moment. But she's leaving soon and I'm being transferred. Which worries me because it's took me ages to trust her. I'm starting anti depressants on the 5th of July. And they're sorting out therapy. But honestly I don't think it's going to work. I feel really hopeless and lost right now
depression,erqsgr2,t1_erqrw76,1561150929.0,The only way I'm dealing with all this is hurting myself. There is this person in my life rn who's a good but new friend. And he does help so much. But he tends to say this alot. So idk.
depression,erqrw76,t1_erqrl1h,1561150530.0,I won't go into all the details. But I've experienced alot of sexual abuse of older people. And it's lead me to be really depressed and suicidal. I don't really feel much. And I'm pushing all my friends and the people I've liked away. I feel trapped. I'm constantly paranoid. And I feel like I'm never gonna be good enough for anyone.

AskReddit,ergp5jq,t3_c1qokc,1560851159.0,"Honestly, I drink it as comfort. When things are getting bad I drink. It kinda helps me forget for a while and be carefree. I'm aware of the danger. But sometimes I have no clue what to turn To. I don't drink everyday. Not even close."
AskReddit,ergowjp,t3_c1lphv,1560850770.0,"To have someone to love and to share all the memories they weren't there for, and for you to go on and make more. Everyone deserves to feel loved."
AskReddit,ergotk7,t3_c1wj6i,1560850638.0,Honestly probably knowing my friends and family. It must be heart breaking for someone to look you in the eye and not remember any memory you once shared. The fact that they would look at you and remember all these things. And for you to look at them and it to be blank. That's scary man
AskReddit,ergokyp,t3_c200sg,1560850270.0,"Told me that if they had to wake up and look in a mirror to see my  face they'd kill themselves

depression,ergo4dp,t3_c1ug9l,1560849547.0,"I feel that. I do too. I miss how I used to be able to smile without forcing it. I miss how I could trust the people around me instead of comparing their actions to the things in the past. I miss loving a carefree life where I didn't feel restricted by my own thoughts and past. I miss wanting to be alive . But now I'm just trapped in this cycle, and honestly I don't know how to escape it. It's terrifying. I miss all my old friends who left because I wasn't good enough, because my depression changed me. I miss how I used to be. But the worst part is,after being so depressed for pretty much 5 nearly 6 years now. I don't think I truly know the old me. I can't remember what it feels like to feel joy and happiness. I really do miss the old me but I feel like it's gone. And there is no way I can get that back"

depression,erbs25f,t1_erbrsrg,1560692174.0,"I suppose so but it will take a while to get used to,one of my friends is much older than me and he's moving back to his home country. So it's gonna be much more difficult to chat with them.  I'm trying to fight the loneliness,maybe it will fix itself when I go to college. Thank you for the advice though"

ask,erbkbfy,t3_c18cj4,1560684434.0,Talk to a professional as difficult as it may be to. In the end it's worth it. At first it may be difficult. But nothing is a smooth recovery. There is ups and downs. But sometimes you can't handle it on your own. If you struggle to speak of how you feel. Write in a notebook and give it to someone you trust. And they can write back. It helps alot. And when you feel comfortable enough remember that support will always be there
depression,erbjquj,t3_c14782,1560683736.0,Ive just left school. So im gonna be on my own for a while. 12 weeks to be exact. I barely cope being in alone at weekends. Never mind that long. I can't go out with friends as they're all still in school. I'm honestly kinda afraid. Worst of all I'm starting anti depressants on the 5th of July. It's gonna mess with my head and being alone is kinda scary. Any advice?
depression,erbiy5a,t3_c15xq8,1560682668.0,"Yeah,I kinda see it as that escape option. Knowing it's there comforts me. Because sometimes I know I won't be able to cope much longer. So I know there is a way out"
