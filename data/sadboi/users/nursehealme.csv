i got a ct scan on my head, neck, and stomach (the impact caused me to go forward on my seat belt, which was pressed against my stomach, pretty hard)-- the scans were all clear, no internal injuries or anything like that. i was put on cyclobenzaprine and tramadol for the pain, though i've only taken the cyclobenzaprine (have hesitations about the tramadol) with no serious reactions or changes in behavior (just the usual loopiness/silliness before it knocks me the hell out, lol)

it's funny you mention watching a lot of TV to get through because i've been doing exactly that! lots of sci-fi and action movies... they make for great escapism!"

sometimes i take them seriously too-- i've somewhat outgrown this, but when i was little i used to have hair that was long enough to tie back in a ponytail, and whenever i was being my fidgety impatient self and my mother told me to ""hold my horses"" (as in, to be patient), my baby brain thought she meant to hold my own ponytail (bc you know... horse and pony), which i did. 

it always resulted in laughs from my parents, though in my mind i was being 10000% serious and just following instructions haha"

over time, it's gotten a little better. i'm trying very hard to learn how to get better associations with said intetests (as odd as it may sound, sometimes it helps when someone i consider a close friend gets into it. it helps clear its name for me, somewhat), or reclaim them for myself when i get the mental energy to."
