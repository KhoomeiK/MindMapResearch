SkincareAddiction,fpsbinx,t1_fpoti7w,1588870683.0,Thank you! That‚Äôs definitely one of the top ones I was looking at.
SkincareAddiction,fp0vbur,t1_fp0v0cu,1588217745.0,"Sorry to be vague but specific products I love are the Innisfree cleansing oil and cleansing water. COSRX pimple patches, rice nourishing overnight mask, snail mucin serum. Skinfood and Tony Moly has great products as well. Peach & Lily glass skin serum is a cult favorite."
SkincareAddiction,fp0v0cu,t3_gankpc,1588217539.0,"I recommend Peach & Lily, Innisfree, COSRX, and checking out Sokoglam.com and explore on your own!"
SuicideBereavement,fo9go02,t1_fo1xz5t,1587619006.0,"Oh my god I‚Äôm so sorry OP, I found my brother in a similar way, but the paramedics removed him and what was holding him up. That experience of taking her down sounds awful! May I ask, did you choose to do it rather than the paramedics, or did you just not know what to do?"
SuicideBereavement,fo9gir7,t1_fo95zgq,1587618889.0,Yeah I hope OP survived. Update us üíú
uberdrivers,fh1rexp,t3_f11ukf,1581222005.0,That is so shitty!!!! So it was a 3 car pileup?? I hope the car behind you (middle if I read correctly??) was ok and you too :(
riverdale,fg77lrp,t3_evthj4,1580585875.0,"I love seeing Cheryl and Veronica together, but I cringe so hard every time they casually swig back a whole shot of rum in their business meetings. Why even pretend to be high schoolers at this point?! 
Each episode gets more painful to watch but God this was the worst. Please please PLEASE KILL this stupid war with ‚Äúdaddykins‚Äù WE ALL HATE IT SO MUCH."

YouOnLifetime,fca9qqh,t1_fc8r120,1577565272.0,"It‚Äôs just annoying bc I thought Love was being a devious liar, but in reality it‚Äôs just a plot hole. Smh"
YouOnLifetime,fc81yit,t3_efszqy,1577524742.0,"Did anyone immediately think of Love being completely sloshed the night before as she reveals she‚Äôs pregnant????? I refused to believe it because of that, but then they never dropped the pregnancy thing"
SuicideWatch,fbx7cv5,t3_eetw0h,1577172609.0,"Wow. I lost a loved one to suicide and I so wish their story ended like yours, in you still alive... I‚Äôm proud of you for getting help, it sounds like you really want help for yourself, which is key to getting better! All the best"

SuicideWatch,fbx3met,t3_e8gjky,1577167993.0,"This must be a terrible traumatic time for you. I hope that professional help is accessible to you where you are... I recently found a therapist for the first time and it was easier than I thought! 
One phrase that got me through hard times was ‚Äúit gets better‚Äù. Whatever you‚Äôre going through now ... there‚Äôs a light at the end of the tunnel. If you ever want to talk I can just listen. Take care."
recruiting,f75s77a,t1_f72495n,1573418552.0,"I‚Äôd follow up with a recruiter once, if they have a qualified candidate reach out twice and they wanna pass that up, find a better recruiter who will care."

riverdale,f63cal0,t1_f5y9ive,1572674955.0,He did worse to the car than was done to his office. (Broken windows)

riverdale,f63a2e1,t3_dpcaoj,1572673924.0,"Biggest takeaways

‚Ä¢I never got that Jellybean being knocked out was just a prank? Must have missed where she said ‚Äúgotcha!‚Äù

‚Ä¢how is Toni still with Cheryl, that must end

‚Ä¢when did Falice get together? That has not been developed wtf, or did I miss that? 

‚Ä¢how did Veronica just leave a man in flames on what appears to be a carpeted floor and then run away and we don‚Äôt hear about it again? How did the whole place not burn down? 

‚Ä¢Mr. Honey destroying Reggie‚Äôs car is beyond fucked up

‚Ä¢same for Mr. Chipping just being super Ok with Jug‚Äôs hazing. My claustrophobia was TRIGGERED by that scene.

‚Ä¢also from last episode - we know Edgar is dead, but they didn‚Äôt kill Evelyn, so where is she? And are they not going to mention that there is a whole squad of other ‚Äúfarmies‚Äù that need to be deprogrammed like Polly? 

‚Ä¢like others have said, how are kids just allowed to dress up as the town‚Äôs nightmares."
uberdrivers,f5ir77j,t1_f5ijg0m,1572217274.0,Lmao true that
uberdrivers,f5eowju,t3_dnlgym,1572173271.0,"They always offer to get me something but I feel like they don‚Äôt actually expect me to say yes, they are just being courteous. 
The last time I went to a drive thru, pax had been bitchy to start, then asked to stop at Del Taco. The drive thru took ONE WHOLE HOUR and I lost my next ride which had already been queued. Once you‚Äôre in that damn line you can‚Äôt get out. And all she got was 2 fucking tacos. That‚Äôs all it took for me to adopt a ‚Äúno drive thru‚Äù policy."
