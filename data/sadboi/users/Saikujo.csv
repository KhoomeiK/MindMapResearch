SuicideWatch,fqc6742,t1_fqc524h,1589250954.0,i get what you're saying. it's impossible for me to understand how someone can sink thousands of hours in one game. i would just get so bored.
SuicideWatch,fqc5y5j,t1_fqc4r5f,1589250801.0,i have a similar problem too. whenever i'm asked about how something makes me feel my brain just shuts down and i dont know what to say.
SuicideWatch,fqc2uvv,t1_fqc21xm,1589248976.0,"honestly animal crossing gets to a point where it becomes a daily routine, you usually just get on and do whatever little things you have to do for the day. its rare that i have days like today where i actually put in effort to build stuff on my island.
honestly i dont play on my switch tooo much but i did sink way too much time into breath of the wild. I have been playing through the resident evil series on pc and i love those games"
SuicideWatch,fqc2ibt,t1_fqc29m0,1589248775.0,therapists* lol. sadly i've only really had bad experiences with therapists. it sucks too bc the amount of therapists in my area is so limited
SuicideWatch,fqc1miq,t1_fqc1awj,1589248260.0,"thanks, im more into video games. basically spent all day playing animal crossing lol"
aspergers,fooynx7,t3_g7nrq7,1587949263.0,"Definitely, and it’s made me super depressed. The worst part is being around people that didn’t experience this social isolation and feeling even more depressed because you see how much more developed socially they are then you and you feel like you’ve ruined your entire life because of it :("
aspergers,fooyhpu,t3_g6bukh,1587949157.0,"same for me. my therapist is doing online sessions and I had to ask her if it was okay to just to do it over the phone, and i straight up will refuse to FaceTime anyone just bc I hate seeing my face in the corner of the screen."
Buddhism,fol8571,t3_g82709,1587856771.0,Thanks for the resources everyone! I think I’m starting to understand the topic a little bit better.
selfharm,fmvapzg,t1_fmv97cm,1586410811.0,if only i could :( still have over a year until i can transfer to a university so i'm stuck suffering with judgmental and over protective parents. so wish i could just pick a direction and drive and just start a new life away from everyone i know

mentalhealth,fl2d4h8,t3_flfaa0,1584748277.0,"I’ve used this a couple times but the last time I used it the crisis worker ignored me. She asked me to explain what was going on so I did. No reply. Thought I might’ve gone over the word limit so I explained shorter. No response. Asked if anyone was still there. 15 minutes later, no response. I think it just depends on the person you get though."
cults,fkzsnx9,t3_fllqj7,1584679197.0,"Maybe Hon-Ming Chen from Chen Tao? He was known to have allowed members to come and go as they pleased (the police tried to arrest him for kidnapping but they found out the member was there willingly and he was more than happy to turn her over to the police). Once his prophecies were shown to be fake, he told his followers to not believe anything he said. Somehow people still followed him, though lol."
selfharm,fkwkbr1,t3_fktolw,1584595164.0,whenever I try to do things like draw on my arms etc it always just amplified the intrusive thoughts telling me to self harm and made it easier for me to give in to actually doing it
aspergers,fkod64e,t3_fjo274,1584384845.0,Yep. Was constantly asked if I was angry or sad during school. People seemed surprised when I told them I was fine.
aspergers,fkck5he,t3_fhkaho,1584054808.0,"I think so, at work i found out i'm the person anyone goes to when they have something they don't want to do because i feel bad saying no."

aspergers,fju7ftu,t3_fedrbu,1583614253.0,Yep and it pisses people off to no end but I can’t help it. My anxiety gets too much to handle if I don’t know exactly what I have to do even if it’s minor
autism,fju6bkb,t3_fezcem,1583613992.0,I LOVE showering with the lights off. I have really bad body dysmorphia and am really sensitive to bright lights so it’s a win-win for me
aspergers,fjs16id,t3_fetccr,1583592648.0,definitely. I feel like I have too much empathy and it can hurt me sometimes bc I know I’m easier to manipulate. I just can’t stand seeing people angry or sad.

cassetteculture,fjah2ru,t3_fcf6rx,1583173357.0,was literally just gonna buy this album but bought some others instead. Such a good album for boring waits at the airport
aspergers,fj73049,t3_fbkye4,1583085410.0,I’m the same way. I really want to have friends and stuff but then I think about the commitment and being judged or lied to and it just feels so overwhelming.
SuicideWatch,fj4slp2,t1_fj4jbt3,1583015902.0,yeah I have some online trans friends but when I tried to talk about it to them their response was “oof”. feels great getting that as a response when they know how awful it feels

SuicideWatch,fipkvmg,t1_fipkj1y,1582610162.0,I wasted my entire teenage years and it hurts so much to know that I did. I feel like useless trash that only hinders other people. I deserve it bc I wasted everyone’s time who have known me.

autism,filuxxq,t1_filuio4,1582510952.0,i used to have a therapist but i stopped going to him after he started verbally abusing me for having dysphoria. i also have a psychiatrist but i psych myself out of scheduling appointments with her because she's always really cold to me. sadly i live in an area with no therapists that specialize in gender dysphoria so i'm kind of lost in terms how to get help now.

aspergers,fi30pwb,t3_f64vs3,1582095786.0,I think everything for me needs to have a purpose or a reason or needs to be explained in detail so it boggles my mind how some people can go through life being so blind to how the world really is. I honestly envy them. I wish I didn’t have to have a reason for everything.
aspergers,fi1qhi9,t3_f5u2cy,1582062791.0,I hate asking questions you get a fake answer to. Why can’t we just settle for “hi” or a hand wave?
aspergers,fhwpmm4,t1_fhwpgln,1581924350.0,same. if I know i've disappointed someone i always feel like it's the end of the world and will stress out about it for days

aspergers,fhr7c7s,t3_f4bdrf,1581819289.0,i love that. one of my psych teachers was sensitive to light so she would always have our class's lights down super dim and it made me so much more comfortable

SuicideWatch,fhg2epy,t1_fhg1yix,1581557003.0,i have looked at psychology today AND talked to other therapists and psychiatrists in the area. there are literally zero therapists that focus on transgender issues within 30 miles of me. all of the therapists in my area are super religious. they would just shame me and laugh at me like they always do.
SuicideWatch,fhg0gwb,t1_fhg04vy,1581555687.0,"i would ""jokingly"" dress up as a girl when i was younger, never felt like i related to any guys, had a hard time being ""tough"" or ""manly"". if you mean are they supportive then they say they are, but they're just constantly so awkward around me nowadays that i know they hate me."
