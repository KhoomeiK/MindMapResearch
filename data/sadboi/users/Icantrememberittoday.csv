It seems that TiA does have a lot of that, but also mocks some pretty daft people pushing their ideologies, while FWR does call people fragile who complain of racism by people that aren't white when they have a valid complaint, even if a lot of people they mock are those you describe too."

Advice,flm415e,t3_fpn3lz,1585274072.0,"I'm a 'casual gamer' - by that i mean that i am not good at any games really. But i love the stories and the experience. I have a PS4 and there are quite a few games i have given up on because they are too tricky, but i recommend these if you just want to have fun and get through a good story without too much difficulty:

Yakuza (there are loads of these)-any, they are all awesome fun

Uncharted series (4 or 5 games and all fantastic)

The last of us - post zombie apocalypse and an amazing story

Good luck and have fun"

mentalhealth,flltne1,t3_fplncz,1585267504.0,"Yes, but i find comparing yourself to others is simply never productive. Make your own goals, based on what YOU can achieve and make a plan to move towards them. Don't focus on others. Now and then you will realise how far you have come, but you will lose al motivation if you constantly compare where you are to where others are that have been moving in a certain direction for far longer than you."

Fitness,fef8z6v,t3_eojd15,1579051003.0,"Base the bulk of your workouts around what you like doing. If you HATE deadlifts, dont do them. Do something else. Deadlifts don't work if you skip doing them. If you like what you do when you're in the gym it's a whole lot easier to get into the gym, and slower results are better than no results."
rugbyunion,feaur29,t1_fe86uig,1578952354.0,"Completely this. Rugby has a place for everyone from tall to short, fat to thin. What I like is that there are so many different ways to win a game and it is so multi dimensional. This will push union more towards league."

People should know that if you think someone may be considering anything, asking them if they are does not affect the likelihood. People often worried it might put ideas in peoples heads. It wont. Always ask if in any doubt."

movies,feaacgd,t1_fea9pi4,1578946243.0,I agree with half your point - there is definitely not equality of opportunity though. How you get equality of opportunity is a very difficult question and what we do until we are there is even more so. I don't think that manipulating outcomes at the top end is the way to achieve it though.

videos,fainrpi,t1_fainbum,1576112325.0,"That is a good suggestion, but this is what the hospital charges per procedure. Not what it costs those consumers that pay. 

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFtAohYPSFc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFtAohYPSFc)

Why does the US spend so much on healthcare?

* People use the same amount as elsewhere, but it costs a lot more. 
* American personal health spending grew $930B dollars between 1996 and 2013, $574B once increased population etc accounted for.
* People are actually healthier than they were in 1996
* People spent less time in the hospital
* 63% of the increased is that people are charged more and more is done per visit (see defensive medicine)
* Almost all the increased spending from 2003-2007 is due to increased prices."
mentalhealth,fainfh3,t3_e9czdd,1576112089.0,"Are you on a lot of social media? Because social media constantly provides an artificial view of how everyone else lives, and people naturally compare and feel inadequate. I recommend shutting any/all social media accounts.  The irony being that because even those with seemingly great lives knowing that how they appear is not a real representation of their real life, everyone ends up suffering from this comparison mindset.

VeganZeroWaste,fai42qf,t3_dr9do4,1576099417.0,"This is so true. 

I met some vegans who when i asked about improvements i could make just enjoyed being on their high horse and absolutist, which actually made it seem unrealistic and delayed me moving in that direction. It was only when i met some that were open to me making small improvements but politely discussing my sticking points in a non judgemental way that got me started, and since then i have made massive strides. Not perfect, but moving in the right direction."

reddevils,f9crw3j,t3_e4l93a,1575226753.0,Being an ex footballer doesn't make you a football manager. Why on earth did anyone think he was up to it in the first place is beyond me. Hiring someone who has been a bad manager elsewhere hoping they will be a good one for you is ridiculous. He is a united legend but a poor football manager. Hire someone who is better. The players are not up to it either but a good manager would get a lot more out of them than this.
