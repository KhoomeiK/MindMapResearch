eat sushi
watch all the new movies that you would never know about if you were dead
learn how to perfect my makeup
got a tattoo
gone clubbing
gone to house parties
snuck out
had sex 
met new loving friends

There so many things you will never get to enjoy if you‚Äôre dead. Are you a fan of One Direction (please say yes)? If they get back together.. you‚Äôll never know. You‚Äôll never hear your favourite artist new songs. You‚Äôll never see your family again, make them laugh, laugh with them. If you have pets, imagine how confused they would be without you there.
