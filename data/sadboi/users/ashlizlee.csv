I don‚Äôt mind the creative liberties because as long as they keep adapting for the masses there will be people who are drawn to Austen‚Äôs world and want to read the books. In Jane‚Äôs time, the novel was something a lot of people poked fun at because they thought it was a sign of a fanciful or silly reader. Much like today, when some book lovers poke fun at the people who are drawn to the flashy adaptations. The beauty of Austen is that it survives and we can cherish it in one way or another."
