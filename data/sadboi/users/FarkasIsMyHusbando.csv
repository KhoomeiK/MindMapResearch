I won't be surprised if I get downvoted into oblivion for this, but it's pretty much the reason I've become a lurker in this sub. 

There's tons of anti-Anders posts, which I normally wouldn't mind because, especially because I romanced him, I completely understand why people would be pissed at him. 

However, so many of them put him in a black and white viewpoint while complaining about his black and white viewpoints and defending other characters black and white viewpoints. 

Like, really? 

Merrill's blood magic leaves lasting damage on her people. Isabella sends Kirkwall into a huge fight with the Qunari over a book she stole that she only bothers to return *IF* you get your friendship level high enough with her, and even then, she almost didn't return it. Sebastian goes to war with all of Kirkwall if you don't kill Anders or turn Anders over to him. Fenris craps on mages while having a mage for a sister, a sister who he claims to care about or he wouldn't have gone to meet her, and somehow people don't see how that's hypocritical.

Nearly all the main characters in DA2 have huge flaws. Anders just ends up being the one to get the short end of the stick and, like in Dragon Age Inquisition, turn out to be the one in your party that royally fucks shit up at the end of the game. Have yet to play Origins, but from what I've heard of what he's like in Origins, it's very clear to me that Anders flaws lay more with allowing Justice to live in him than anything else and that, had he said no to Justice, Dragon Age 2 would have ended very differently. Either by the Chantry not being blown up at all or someone else being the one to blow the Chantry to bits. 

Heck, if you rivalmance him, he even tells you that he's got blank spots in his memory from Justice/Vengeance and that that scares him. It scares him. Then the Chantry blows up and he's ready and willing for you to kill him, which is the exact opposite reaction you'd get from someone who's okay with blowing up the Chantry. If you keep him alive in the end, it's then discussed, by Varric, if I remember correctly, in Inquisition that Anders can't be left alone for long periods of time because he's now a mess over everything that happened. That's not the reaction of a monster who revels in what they've done. That's the reaction of someone who made a huge mistake that he now has to live with for the rest of his life."

fo76,fps7w0n,t1_fprg2ad,1588868952.0,"I was finding arrows on a pretty regular basis until I crafted a bow. Now they're all hiding apparently. All the ones I found before crafting a bow I dropped for a friend that crafted a bow before I decided to have a bow, so now I have less than 100 arrows and will apparently need to craft a bunch for when I actually start using the bow."
fo76,fpqot44,t1_fpp5xkq,1588828030.0,And now I have that one sexual saxophone song stuck in my head. Thanks.
fo76,fpqogm1,t1_fpqny9u,1588827772.0,"Maybe try again. Plans move fast for my character and the only reason I don't do food and drinks at the moment is because I sprinkle them around the world for free now to clear up slots for selling even more plans. As for gear, unless you have it fully tricked out, all they have to do is wait five or ten levels and they're replacing, for example, their level five set with a level ten set. This is also why I end up crafting low level gear, fixing it up, and then leaving it around the vault area for new players and is why I crafted some gear at a couple different levels for one of my friends low level characters. By the time they outlevel that stuff, they should at least have the plans available to craft them on their own, even if they might not have all the mod options unlocked."
fo76,fpqnur2,t1_fpnthcj,1588827316.0,Exactly. My main is 120+ and is situated in the camp to sell good stuff cheap to low and high levels alike. Plus shopping at a low level players camp is a great way to make their day and you never know when you might find a mule with great bargains.
fo76,fpqnoof,t1_fpnwo4q,1588827191.0,"What platform? I do XBox, set up in the forest, stocking items for low and high level alike, and have no trouble getting stuff to move. Usually get a low level coming in to wipe out my plans while a high level comes by and buys all my fusion cores and higher level ammo."
fo76,fpqni4i,t1_fpnv7z7,1588827058.0,"Level 120+ in the forest, selling stuff for low levels and high levels alike. It's also a gorgeous area, the enemies are low level so my house holds up longer, and it doesn't get nuked."
fo76,fpqncbj,t1_fppf7g8,1588826942.0,"That explains the multiple individual arrows in someone's camp that were priced at 30k each. I was thinking to myself ""I know I saw them a lot when Wastelanders dropped but now can't seem to find them at all since I crafted a bow, but damn, they aren't *that* rare!"""
fo76,fpqn4kd,t1_fppkm7f,1588826786.0,"I have a camp in the forest to help low levels (and also high, but that's not the point) and I sell a lot of plans, especially recipes. Low level gear fully fixed up might be a good idea. 38 ammo and 10mm ammo is good, although 38 is used more by low levels, whereas 10mm gets used a lot by both low and high alike. Sell it at a cap per round and you'll definitely at least have higher levels picking up the 10mm ammo. If you're feeling especially generous, what I usually do is go to around the vault and overseers camp and sprinkle 38 ammo in containers, followed by some fully upgraded, low level gear."
fo76,fpqmoz5,t1_fpnumqw,1588826472.0,"I cater to all levels while sticking to the forest to help low levels save caps on traveling. I figure higher levels will eventually reach a point where they have a lot of dailies sending them all over the map anyway, so if you're a high level, plan your route accordingly and my camp won't be all that far out of the way anyway (which also saves fast travel caps for high level players). Stop by and you can get power armor plans for half the games projected value, while a level five player stands beside you, emptying out my selection of five cap recipes. If I have caps to spare, I also like to travel around to low level peoples camps to see if there's a couple things I can buy to send some caps their way, because, especially now that I have a secondary character that's low level, I'm very aware how hard caps are to come by at the beginning of the game. Even if it's some purified water, 10mm ammo for a friend, or a lvl 1 leather chest piece I end up scrapping, I know they'll be happy."

fo76,fpqkww9,t1_fpq3zoa,1588825220.0,...Same.
fo76,fpqkpxp,t3_geu79m,1588825089.0,"Put it by the ""thanks for one shotting all the legendaries before anyone else even saw them arrive. If you complain on Reddit about how this game is too easy anymore and everything needs a buff, the ghost of molerats past are going to come haunt your bed tonight."""
fo76,fpqiekz,t1_fpp2axo,1588823513.0,"People love to do that at the SBQ fight and since I've recently found Pacifist mode having a mind of its own for at least my main character, it resulted in me getting killed by a player who then took out the rest of my crew while I was spawning back in. Lost all my flux. Was not happy, especially since I had no warning they were shooting at me until after I was already dead. Now I'm having to check my settings on a regular basis to make sure pacifist remains active. Spoiler alert: it keeps shutting itself off.

But if you want to claim a bounty on someone, even though the loading screen discussing bounties implies that getting a bounty makes it open season for literally anyone and everyone to take you out, you better make sure pacifist is off or you'll be wasting bullets on them, while wondering why the hell you can VATS them but nothing's happening.

Remember to turn it back on after you're done. ;)"
fo76,fpqhp27,t1_fpp7x3r,1588823044.0,Some times you need a safe room to drop things for other people (especially when the trade menus are bugging out yet again). Some times you want a room to nap in without having an audience. I've had doors locked. I've had doors not locked. It's whatever.
fo76,fpqhc9t,t1_fppb63x,1588822811.0,"Unless they changed it, Pacifist mode doesn't work in workshops. Source: multiple times where low level me in Pacifist mode was fixing up a workshop in the forest for fellow lowbies, only to get absolutely melted by someone whose level is multiple times mine, they take my loot, teabag my corpse to brag about how they're unable to pick on someone their own size, and then don't even bother to claim the workshop. Needless to say, I've pretty much given up on workshops since then. If I can sneak in, grab it, and bolt, fine. Otherwise, forget it. The xp and loot gained from it isn't worth dying over. If I'm in the mood for some PVP, I'll hop over to Nuclear Winter for a bit."
