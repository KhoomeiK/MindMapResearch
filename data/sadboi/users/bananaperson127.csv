I think the tortilla will make or break your burrito, and since you're in Europe I doubt you'll find good tortillas in store (when I searched for them and was disappointed). They seriously taste different from the packaged ones. Have fun."

Also, I love the way in which you carry out your trials before finishing it up, ita great for a non professional baker who can't take the time to make the recipe multiple times in a week in order for troubleshooting.

Now, for the question: could you explain more about the science of swiss buttercream? I havent found much online, only tips, but I'd like to understand it on a deeper level and know why and how it works.
