That being said, I can point to several occasions where I am sure my mother meant to hurt me for not doing her will, and several where father's contempt could only have been meant to hurt.  They were both abused by their parents and I feel like all they did to improve on that was to only extremely rarely *physically* abuse their own children.  We were psychologically and emotionally abused, no doubt.  

Having said that, neither of them have ever seemed very concerned about the damage we kids suffered, and certainly never invited conversation about it that might be difficult or painful for them.  What blame there is to be laid for not having the relationship they want is on us, the kids. ""We did our best"" is probably what they still tell themselves."
CPTSD,fmtab2t,t3_fwnh7l,1586369396.0,"I don't live with mine any more.  They've been married over 50 years and I can't understand why they never divorced.  I wish they would have.   If they really do love each other, you could have fooled me.  One of the saddest parts is that they go through the motions fairly convincingly and so it took me literal decades to figure out what felt so wrong in the dynamic.  We always heard the words ""I love you"" from Mother to Father and from them to us children.  Only Father seems to take any opportunity to be away from her, he oozes contempt when he's home, he's sarcastic but passes it off as jokes, he's always buzzed when he's around. I've seen him flirt with other women and make shitty remarks about women's bodies when he thinks I can't hear and he just generally seems like a huge misogynist who manages to keep his mouth shut most of the time around his wife and daughters.   Sons can do no wrong. I think he really hates his female nuclear family, just he's never verbalized as much to us.

And he certainly never shielded us children from mother's rages and moods and invasiveness.  ""Just do what your mother wants"", whatever the cost to us.  Sometimes our noncompliance or reluctance earned us screaming and having the doors taken off our rooms.

He and mother share hardly any interests, which doesn't necessarily mean anything about their feelings for each other, but it really seems like he can't stand being around her while she's always trying to get him to prove he loves her.  Watch out if he dares forget an anniversary or holiday she cares about.  It seems like as long as someone goes through the motions and she gets a card or flowers or something, she'll act like everything is fine and like they have such a great relationship.

I was deathly afraid of getting into a relationship as an adult, because I thought the one modeled by my parents was all there could be to it.  Two people who don't love or respect each other but who stay together because of sunk cost or some religious ceremony decades ago.  How bleak is that."

One holiday I told my mother I was ill and would not be doing anything for the holiday.  She showed up uninvited at my home and rang and I did not answer.  She didn't leave; she rang and knocked and phoned and phoned and then after a few minutes I overheard her gossipping about me to a neighbor, telling this complete stranger about my life and about my illness.  Mum's just trying to bring her sick child presents on The Holiday!  Will the neighbor take the presents for her and relay them to me and then contact my mother about me when I have received them?  The neighbor spinelessly fell for her shit, and mum covered my peephole camera with a note before finally leaving.  I could no longer see who might be on my doorstep.  

I found that she had left me nine messages regarding her on-site efforts in various formats, text, voicemail, and note: all about how she's just trying to be nice to me and give me gifts.  In *zero* of these communications did she mention my illness or express any hopes for my recovery at all.  In a follow-up communication she criticized me for not talking more with her in general, and she told me how great she thought the neighbor was for helping her.  Still nothing about me other than my failing to meet her demands.  

I think the less self-reflective ones may on the surface have convinced themselves that they're demonstrating love, but on some level they know they're saying you're not the boss of them.

I don't remember that I had nightmares about them while growing up in their home.  Maybe I had them then, maybe not.  I feared ""night monsters"" but can't remember that those monsters took a form.

After moving out at 18, the clear nightmares about them started.  (tw for CSA)



Performing sexual acts with my father, fighting him.  Physically fighting my mother, trying to get her to leave me alone or to extract myself from her grip.  Screaming at my mother and my siblings to hear me, and they won't listen, and my voice gives out to whisper-screams.  Trying to hide from them, them chasing me down.  Knowing they've kept something from me too and they won't say.  These nightmares have all persisted for 30 years.  I wake up screaming, crying, sweating.  

FWIW I've taken Prazosin for a couple of years now and that has helped reduce the severity and frequency of the nightmares, and cut back on the physical symptoms.  It's rare now that I wake up in terror or totally drenched in sweat or crying miserable tears.  Worth asking your Dr about, IMO.  Hopefully with sufficient therapy and resolution one of these years, these nightmares will end, but for now the Prazosin is a godsend for me getting some improved sleep."

raisedbynarcissists,ezffus3,t1_eyuqur6,1567877172.0,"I've made similar mistakes for nearly 20 years of my adult life, before finally making the connection that I kept gravitating to and bonding with emotionally abusive people because that's what I'd been conditioned to expect from relationships.  Because that's how my family functioned.  It was my ""normal"".  

I'm really sorry.  I know how it sucks to go to your family for support only for them to not care, or to invalidate you, or to blame you for being abused.  

And how awful it is to confide in siblings, have them claim to understand, and then turn around and betray you to gain points with Mom, prop their own ego at your expense, or whatever the dysfunctional angle is.  If you suspect your sister is a flying monkey or N, she probably is.  From what you've written, she definitely seems more invested in keeping close to your mother and in maintaining unhealthy friendships than in treating you like you matter much at all.   I'm sorry.  It's natural for you to feel protective of her, to want to be there for her.  Realizing that she might not care about you much, or that caring is conditional/relative to Mom's wishes, is devastating.  If your sister is very young or is still dependent on your parents for some of her upkeep, there's a chance she will mature and change for the better with time and distance.  She's obviously currently comfortable associating with bullies and enablers like your mother, the person who berated you at her house, and the friends you mention.  That points to her still operating within her own framework of unhealthy coping mechanisms.  Condescension, contempt, and superiority are narc traits.  Keep documenting her behavior.    

For now, it may help to try to view her as if she's a stranger: if you just met someone who treats you like she does, how much effort would you put into the relationship?  How vulnerable would you want to be with this person?  How many chances would you give them to show up, to not ambush you with unexpected people, to not talk down to you?  How much would you confide in them?

Accepting that people who are supposed to love you in fact treat you badly comes with grief like they've **died**.   They're not the people you thought they were, or the people you want them to be.  I've known my siblings are untrustworthy, inconsistent, sometimes downright bullying and mean people for over 30 years.  I forgave them over and over and over, I still wanted to believe they loved me for so long.  We all suffered our parents' abuse and neglect; we should all understand and be there for each other, right?  We knew how wrong it felt for our parents to treat us the way they did.  We owed it to each other to be better, not to continue the cycle.

I wish.  They have turned out the same.  When with a lot of therapy I finally realized that I shouldn't tolerate being treated like that by anyone else, but my siblings seemed to believe I **deserved** to be treated badly, exactly like my parents did, I felt like I wanted to die.  I still have days where I cry myself to sleep over not having a family, in the ways that matter.  

You can't control or change your sister's behavior; what you can do is work on protecting yourself from the harm it does you.  Just as you did with your ex and with your mother.  Hope for better in the future, while accepting the present for what it is: your sister is currently a person who believes you deserve to be manipulated, bullied, condescended to, and betrayed.  And she believes it is OK behavior for her to manipulate, bully, and break trust.

It's like death.  It is.  I know.  I'm so sorry.  Be gentle with yourself.  You are worth it and you deserve to be treated well."

If the N knows your address & DOB and/or your social they can apply to get your medical records.  Illegal, but it's been done.

This is what the more covert/controlling stalker Ns can do if they truly feel entitled to all information about their (adult) child and feel like they can get away with it.  Sometimes, they can.

My best advice to OP is to contact medical providers and have them create passwords for your accounts.  It's not foolproof either if you are dealing with the kind of N who hacks your stuff, opens your mail, and taps your phone but it can help with some."

You're not her employee and you never signed on to be.  ""I love you today and every day"" = I miss my subservient doing whatever I tell them.  

My N is pulling very similar crap right now.  I'm sorry yours is doing this to you."

Not OP but thank you, I needed this reminder, too.  I'm doing badly in the wake of my own N's Hoovers where they keep saying they love me and I feel guilty and wonder if their stalking and double standards and power plays were really that bad.  I haven't responded to any Hoovers following the initial one and I'm bracing for the punishment."
