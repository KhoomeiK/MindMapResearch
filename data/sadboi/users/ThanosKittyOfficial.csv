hinduism,f94xwi9,t3_e3q7j0,1575109501.0,"I am a Hindu and I don’t feel irked by converts to Hinduism. In fact, I am proud of you for trying a change in which you are taken on a spiritual and soulful journey in this religion. There is absolutely nothing wrong with converting to any religion, even if people are sceptical. You are who you are and you deserve choices in life. Don’t feel judged by other Hindus. I respect your choice and opinion and most importantly, I have NO problem with that, even though I’m a Native Hindu."

I have 2 very understanding friends who I can talk to, but I feel like I hide myself from all the problems I have and I seem happy when I’m not..."
