Don't be embarrassed by your privilege, it took sacrifice on your part, and it took decades and in some cases centuries of sacrifice in your familial lineage to get you to where you are today, so that you don't have to worry about wolves as much as some of your clients do. You bargained with your future and put faith in the walls of the system that your grandfather and his father's before him built with their bare hands from timber and bitter cold wilderness. Rise above the struggle and always keep your eye on the good and the bad in your life. Give to charities you believe in like crazy, give to your children & your wife like crazy, and mentor. Don't kill, don't cheat, don't lie. That's all. That's human. You can't solve the human condition by forfeiting privilege. ""For to every one who has will more be given, and he will have abundance; but from him who has not, even what he has will be taken away."" â€” Matthew 25:29 Everyone here is sacrificing if they're following Mr. Ramsey's steps.

The initial noise will bring them out of deep sleep, but they will usually fall back into deep sleep within 2 or 3 minutes if they are not disturbed again. Wear socks. Never wear shoes. Step onto area rugs when possible. Push doors toward the hinges while pulling up on the knob, (to reduce rubbing) while simultaneously turning the knob entirely, to keep the latch bolt from rubbing the strike plate. Shoot to step close to walls, doors, heavy furniture. Be aware of furniture that contains rattle prone items like China hutches.

Career,fquktau,t1_fqui6gd,1589660520.0,"Look up the IEC in your state. Ours has suspended enrollment but, our state is partially opening soon and i assume they'll be enrolling again soon. You'll need to pay them 2500 & they'll get you a job and you'll start night classes, twice a week, 2 hours each day they're held. It'll be a lot of algebra, & best practices. They'll get you your OSHA and first aid training and everything you need. But it's not going to be well paid your first couple years. Your first year might be 15 an hour with intermittent layoffs. Your second year might be 17.50. Third year maybe 20 if you're lucky. Fourth year 21 maybe. Once you journey out in your fourth or 5th year, pass your journeyman test, you should receive a good raise if you've been at the same company for a while. At least 24-25 an hour. Once you're a journeyman for a year or so you can request journeyman wages, which if Google is correct, you should hit close to 60k in Illinois, especially in a metro, BEFORE overtime.  

But i can't stress enough how you shouljd be able to get a job with your decorated education background.  There's no doubt in my mind that if you spent the same 2500 you're going to pay the IEC, on a good personal recruiting agent, you'll find a job at least paying 20 an hour with your degree. Even if it's a temp job... you can make PowerPoint presentations for 20 an hour man.

Oh, alternatively, you can take online classes and pay the IEC something like $700 a year to be a member, and they'll give you access to their apprenticeship job pool."
Career,fqub4nv,t3_gkz9n1,1589655539.0,"Best thing to do is start right away. Do you have savings? Where do you live? I find it hard to believe you cannot find a job at 37 with a degree in graphic design? Do you have an associate's or a bachelor's? What are some reasons you're getting turned down? You might want to look into going back to school for something related to graphic design. But if you're unable to move or commute to a big city with graphic design jobs, and you're dead set on becoming an electrician, you have to start by either securing a apprenticeship, or going to school. There's typically 4 years of theory classes, and 4 years of labor, then you become a journeyman. Start taking the first year of classes immediately if this is what you're going to do. Regardless of whether you've got a 1st year apprenticeship job or not. You'll thank yourself when you're in your 4th year of labor & you dont have to go home and do schoolwork 2 days a week. There's online schools and there's typically programs set up at community colleges. Your state's adult ed/ continuing education board will have them as well, in addition to the IEC and your local electrical union. The union is the holy grail, because they put you through school for free, and you typically reach great pay after putting in a couple years as an apprentice. The IEC is like a union, but you're basically paying them 2500 a year to keep you working and teach you the trade. Next best would be going through the community college system, which is usually pricey. Next best would be going through the adult education system, but they typically require that you secure employment as a 1st year apprentice BEFORE you enroll. Next best would be a trade school, which is usually a 1 year intensive program that'll cost you between 15 & 30 grand but it'll knock out all schooling requirements in 1 year. Finally, the online courses. They're garbage but they're cheap and easy. Not the best education and hiring managers know that, but they'll get you through and spit you out an electrician in 4 years.

Are agnostic & cannot honestly say whether there is a designer or designers is irrelevant to the gnostic wisdom found universally, in most religious codecs. You could opt to believe that the Christian texts are humanity's best attempt at solving human suffering. You could admit to yourself that living in such a way as to constantly put down existence/being is no more righteous than living in such a way as to take advantage of the weak, and in doing so, you can adopt a mode of life wherein, you strive to avoid suffering by attempting to become as efficient and as productive as you can be, extracting happiness from sacrifice, for your family. Understand how the 10 commandments keep society from falling apart. Step into line.  Grow up.  Take responsibility. So that your company does even 1% better. So that your peers at work have 1% more job security next year. So that your families can enjoy 1% more food on the table.  So that the guy in the shipping and receiving office whose contemplating suicide puts it off another year.  Anyway, i believe it was camus who said the meaning of life is whatever keeps you from killing yourself.  Do you want to be so shallowly developed that you don't understand what it's like to be the man on the edge? Have a healthy fear of losing everything and develop yourself.  That's all the Christian religion is boiled down. God (the ideal judge) sent his son (the ideal self) to be sacrificed for your sins (mistakes & shortcomings) sooo the entire book leads up to teaching you that the judge and the redeemer are the same character. You fuck up, you face revelations of judgement and pain. You fuck up enough, for long enough, and you're in hell before you ever knew you were dead inside. If you die before you wake up to the fact that you were acting against what you knew to be right, you don't live on in those you set a good example for. You live on in those who deny life. The dead men.  The men who never wake up. There's hell. How'd you like to be trapped in a dying brain, realizing that you did more sabotaging than anything else for the last 78 years?

malementalhealth,fq7yvpb,t3_gh33sv,1589155040.0,"Im not bipolar but i am addicted to nicotine and i learned a LOT about my addiction during this quarantine. I had cut down to half a piece of 2mg gum each hour after newyears. I was having good days and bad days and fully suspected that i was either fighting an infection, dying of a terminal illness, heart & blood pressure issues, or bipolar. I cut my dose down to a quarter every hour and what happended in the following days was incredible. I would wake up exhausted. I couldn't think straight. Each day i would get out of bed and, drive. If i stayed at home, i would wind up laying face down, gripping my pillow as hard as i could, watching my heart palpitations get worse and worse, in sheer dread and mental agony. Anything i focused on would give me intense energy. If i looked at cars for sale I'd get intense warmth in my jowls and energy, and eventually heart palpitations. But if i tried to lay down in complete silence, my eyes would start to tear, I'd lose focus, and then I'd get the heart palpitations and anxiety without any of the energy or warmth. So i was effectively going completely mad. Then i went out one day and bought a pack of cigarettes. And it was rocky smoking that first pack, they were giving me intense buzzing euphoria... but it's been 3 or 4 weeks now and I feel perfectly fine now. Anyway, if anyone here is addicted to nicotine, watch to make sure it's not the reason you're facing swings. Keep your nicotine intake steady until you're ready to purposefully quit. Don't play with it."
electricians,fq7prv7,t1_fq6s3lb,1589149740.0,You've been through a lot. Good man. Congratulations on making it to where you are today. And thanks again.
DaveRamsey,fq797dg,t1_fq766o7,1589143405.0,"I went through several losses, everyone i ever cared about stopped communication, died, or betrayed me, i fell in love with a girl that cheated on me with a drug dealer, began using with her, and lost 8 years to the needle. After getting clean i began listening to traditional conservative podcasts, Jordan Peterson, Dave Ramsey, and ive sacrificed the last 3 years of my life to work. I became a truck driver and spent 2 years thinking in the cab of a truck. Not a single friend ever cared to ask me where i was. I have been through hell. Withdrawal. Death of self. Death of dreams. Death of ego. Death of hope. Before i got clean i understood the world as if all human interaction was either parasitic, or empathetic. I only ever wanted to love someone unconditionally and be unconditionally loved, and raise a child, and i learned that the world won't even look at you, when you're at rock bottom. Women won't give you the warmth of a fake smile before they leave after you explain you're broke & alone. David Ramsey kept me from taking out loans & racking up credit as i built this 60k from nothing. And the conservatives showed me a new way to see the world. Usefulness. Merrit. Sacrifice.  All weights i can lift no matter what i look like or what I've been through. So that's what I'm aiming for. My father didn't marry my mother & conceive me until his mid 40s. I will get there. The area's i am looking at are areas I'd like to live. I hate this state. Every highway is my route to use. Every friend I've ever had is a landmine i don't want to run unto. The condos in nice areas here start at 120-130k whereas i have done my neighborhood research in cities I'm interested in in the south, and i can get a comparable condo in a nice area for 80-90k. That's why I'm thinking about it. But i will save it first and worry later, thanks."
electricians,fq72rr7,t1_fq6aqnn,1589141040.0,Yeah but the living wage in Florida is 11 an hour. The living wage in my state is 20. The journeymen in my state make 36. The journeymen in Florida make 26. If i moved to Florida and paid cash for a 90k condo and made 26 an hour I'd make double the living wage. If i stay here and put 90k down on a 150 thousand dollar trash heap id never hit double the living wage. & i sure as hell wouldn't have a river view. Maybe when they test the hydrants.
DaveRamsey,fq714mw,t1_fq6z7of,1589140433.0,"I mean the average net worth of a 40 year old isn't even 80k, and i do have a 90s car"
electricians,fq6y10l,t1_fq6w6dz,1589139304.0,The union journeymen are making like 38 an hour here. With pension. It's insane.
electricians,fq6w1uz,t1_fq6u0ze,1589138575.0,Yeah there's a big math test to get into the union in my state.
DaveRamsey,fq6vzj0,t1_fq6u3jb,1589138551.0,"Im a philosophy buff man. That all sounds nice and I'll get the hell out of here, i promise you that. But let me sacrifice a bit more. I'll trust the process, but i need to do what i find most logical."
electricians,fq6txi0,t1_fq6tr3d,1589137806.0,Im in the books applying for preapprenticeship waiting for a callback. I doubt know if I can pass that math test right now though.
DaveRamsey,fq6tihc,t1_fq6s73a,1589137649.0,I think my confidence is gon be pretty fucken high when I'm talking to a 23 year old blonde with 80k in my bank account. But I'll work on it man.
electricians,fq6t118,t1_fq6snm5,1589137479.0,Live in the MA/CT/NY area. Ive never made over 18 an hour without overtime and the living wage is 19 an hour here Haha. So I'd love to hit 20.
