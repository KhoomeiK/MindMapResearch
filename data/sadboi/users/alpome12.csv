IWantToLearn,fps8rfs,t3_gatk9q,1588869370.0,There’s not much you can learn move wise with out a partner or a coach but moving in your stance is really good practice. Try moving around in your stance for at least 3 minutes at a time while being aware of circling and not crossing your feet. Other than that you should get your conditioning up as it will certainly be needed once you can get back to the mat. You can also practice taking shots and sprawls on a mattress
