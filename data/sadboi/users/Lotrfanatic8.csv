Immediately after the birth of a modern calf in an industrial meat farm, the calf is separated from its mother and locked inside a cage not much bigger than the calf’s own body. There the calf spends its entire life — about four months on average. It never leaves its cage, nor is it allowed to play with other calves or even walk — all so that its muscles will not grow strong. Soft muscles mean a soft and juicy steak. The first time the calf has a chance to walk, stretch its muscles and touch other calves is on its way to the slaughterhouse. In evolutionary terns, cattle represent one of the most successful animal species every to exist. At the same time, they are some of the most miserable planets in the planet.

If cows had nice lives with good diets and humane treatment, I wouldn’t feel so guilty every time I chew on a steak. But because of their miserable in humane lives, there is a problem in killing them for meat."

stephenking,fqfqkbt,t1_fqfn33r,1589329763.0,"I’ve read *The Long Walk* in its entirety, about four fifths of *The Running Man*, and could barely get to the halfway point of *Roadwork* before dropping it. 

Out of these, I would say *The Long Walk* was alright, *The Running man* bad, and *Roadwork* unbearable. I’m not a book critic, so I can’t elaborate completely on what it was exactly that made me not like them, but I will say this.

These books have a few flaws from what I’ve read:
1. Character development is extremely limited, except for when it is the entirety of the story.

What I mean by this is, Stephen King is known for his in-depth, fleshed-out characters that seem very real and understandable. The Bachman books I’ve read seem to either have no character development and all and just story, to the point where it seems like I’m reading a plot summary, (*The Running Man*) OR the entire story is character development and story is very limited if it’s even there. (*The Long Walk*)

2. Extremely boring 

The thing about *The Long Walk* is that the premise, 100 teen boys go on an endless walk to the death, seems interesting. Until you realize the book is nothing but walking the whole way. The only thing that carries it is the character development and the >!ambiguous ending.!< 

I am probably not informed enough to talk about *Roadwork,* but I’ll do so anyway. The part of it that I did read was so boring it was **painful.** I had to put the book down at times and do things I would otherwise never do, just to get away from it. Again, I’m not informed, but I think part of the boredom came from the ambiguity of it. 

3. Extremely ambiguous at times

In *Roadwork,* I didn’t understand the point of the protagonist’s name. What is his name? Why doesn’t the narrator use his name? It made things extremely boring, difficult, and confusing. A good amount of ambiguity is a nice touch to many works, but too much and it’s like King himself didn’t know what he was doing. Additionally, there’s also the !<ending of *The Long Walk.*!> I’m just not sure about it. It was just too ambiguous for me.


Now I want to stress that I’m probably in no position to criticize him. I’ve only read 3 of his books, and only one of them in its entirety. Still, though, this is my opinion. And because the discussion of a modern horror writer is of no great significance, I am not inclined to debate it with others, merely just to share. Other King books work great for me. I love The Stand, It, and the novellas in Different Seasons. I’m about to start The Dark Tower too."
