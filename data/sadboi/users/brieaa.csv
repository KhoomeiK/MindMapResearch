BPD,ez483p6,t3_cysmqw,1567682715.0,"I struggle HARD. And i have no reason too. My FP (bf) is the most amazing person in the world and he does everything for me, he calms me down when I’m stressed/angry/crying, he’s literally perfect for me. I’m the problem, if i see something that triggers me than my brain will just non-stop think about it, will branch off into other scary thoughts and than i’m scared i’ll be left alone for another girl prettier than me. I have constant thoughts that i’m not good enough, not pretty enough, not skinny enough for him even though he thinks i’m perfect. If i see FP like another photo on social media that’s of another girl, mentions another girl or has anything to do with the thought of a girl (which i think he has stopped doing because he knows it makes me sad, which is another reason i’m a terrible girlfriend) to me it feels like it’s the end of the world and the only thing that can get me out is my bf reassuring me that he loves me about 200 times and even then I’ll probably be sad for the rest of the day. 
he’s also ended up unfriending a lot of girls without any hesitation (and he didn’t even tell me he did it) that made me feel bad about myself, and they were usually all girls he used to talk too before me. i’m sick of my brain. i feel like the most toxic jealous gf ever"
