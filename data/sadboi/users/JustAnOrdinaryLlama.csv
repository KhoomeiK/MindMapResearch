depression,ept22q6,t3_bvup45,1559478792.0,Absolutely. That's the worst part about it. Things that used to be fun before are no longer the same. It's a collective hell for all of us :(
depression_help,epsuphv,t3_bvgaxf,1559467577.0,Your friend sounds like an ignorant person. Having a problem isn't remotely the same as being depressed. Don't ever feel guilty about sharing your troubles with friends ( especially if they're close friends ) It's just sad that they weren't there for you and gave you the exact reaction that would make you avoid telling them things like this in the future. I hope you recover from this setback well and only move forwards after this xx
