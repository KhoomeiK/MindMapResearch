I haven't been able to think about any of this in a positive way and I still don't, but things like your comment might be the tiny steps I need to take to get there. I'm just angry. That's all I feel nowadays about this. I stay as distant from my parents who I'm forced to still live with as possible and just try to forget they exist.



I am still mad at them. They shouldn't have had kids when they did or at all. My mom was still in high school when she had my sister with we-don't-even-know-who as her dad and she and my dad had just graduated high school when they had me. Having kids is a choice no matter what, even if it really came down to it they had access to abortion or adoption services. They were both nothing more than reckless irresponsible teenagers when they conceived me but decided to have me anyway even though they were nowhere near prepared for it. I was essentially a failed vanity project for them.



They both had alcohol addictions, legal problems, mental health problems and not two pennies to rub together when they had me or when my mom had my sister, and it wasn't right to have us. There was nothing else likely to happen besides a terrible childhood for us both and that's exactly what did happen.


And it's not even just that. My dad has matured a lot don't feel that my mom has at all. She's 41 but acts like a 16 year old. She never told me or my sister that we were only half siblings, kept drinking and smoking while pregnant with my sister and me both and throughout our whole childhood, was possible physically abusive to us (I personally don't think any physical punishment to kids is ok but I don't know what qualifies as abuse that's significant. She definitely hit us very frequently as kids, especially me since I was pretty badly behaved.) She's cheated on my dad for most of their 20 year marriage without a shred of remorse, has never held a job and still binge drinks and chainsmokes daily even when we have no money for groceries or bills.


Sorry this turned into a rant, I just really don't love her like one might expect. Right now I'm at a stage where I'm angry to even be around her or think about her. My dad has mostly wised up but she's still the same person she was before I was even born. I don't understand how 20 years does nothing to a person. I've been keeping all these thoughts in so I'm sorry they all came out now. Thank you sincerely for your reply and support."

Not sure if I need to try again or what. The sub just always intimidated me because it seems to be 99% people having really high-level conversations about managing investments or things like that and I already felt stupid for posting there.




It just hits me that I don't think it's possible to live a life I want and the only possible scenario is finding how to accept a life I hate which I think is even worse than being painfully aware of it.



It just seems like I've ruined myself. Everyone says it's my own fault which is ultimately true. I'm the one who went to college when I thought I might not be ready, took out the loans, stayed in bed for days at a time and didn't do anything while I was there, lost a job, failed all my classes etc.



And I've definitely realized that financial and academic problems both are things that people judge you *extremely* harshly for. They think I'm stupid, lazy, irresponsible, impulsive, etc etc. I'm so embarrassed of everything in my life because I *know* people think this about me, I've heard it. The reason it's so bad is because it's just confirmation of what I already think.



Any solution I've had suggested to me for my financial situation basically boils down to grind day in and day out no matter how much you hate it and don't spend a cent for yourself and maybe after 15 years you'll have paid it off and fixed your credit.


Again I know well-paying jobs without degrees exist but that isn't really the point. It was a huge personal goal to just get a degree in itself and I failed miserably at it. And any job I'd feel satisfied and content with does require a degree.


On top of it all my friends have moved past me. They're all thriving academically or some are already graduated and starting families or whatever else they're doing. I'm completely stagnating and I understand they can't relate to me anymore. We're in such different places in life that the friendship just doesn't really work anymore. It's nobody's fault it just happens I guess.



Just feels like even aside from the depression itself because that existed before all this I've doomed myself to a lonely and extremely unfulfilling and unhappy life. It's hard to even see a point in trying to get better now because of it."
mentalillness,f1gwjow,t1_f1gwblj,1569479854.0,"I agree with you, so I just wish I had the money to move somewhere else."
mentalillness,f1guk71,t1_f1gu1pk,1569477860.0,"Thank you. For me personally money is a really big part of my depression / anxiety and why I had such a terrible childhood. I have a ton of debt and horrible credit now so I slave away at a job I hate for no money leftover. 




I was in college but was too depressed to ever get out of bed let alone go to class and I was really close to suicide. I left school and haven't been able to go back. Between my debt, entirely failed grades, and bad credit making it impossible to get student loans again I don't think I'll be able to go back. And there's no job I could see myself enjoying or caring about that doesn't require a college degree. Yes well paying jobs exist without a degree but none that I would be happy doing.



So I'm stuck. I'm doomed to decades and decades of wage slavery, paying off student loans that are literally for nothing since I didn't get any credits and medical bills because I went to a hospital instead of ending my life.




I'd be so much happier if I were free from it all. My ideal life would be on a farm that I could just run to support myself and that's it. No loans, debts, credit, 9-5, any of it. I'd be working extremely hard but I already do and at least then it would be for something. Right now I work my ass off for nothing at all."

I could fill *books* with the things I dislike but not a word of the opposite. It seems like as I try to think about it I just come up with more things I dislike.



And it seems like I have so many problems that are unsolvable. Debt and financial problems, a dysfunctional family who doesn't care about me or each other in general, losing pretty much all of my friends, failing college and probably not being able to ever go back...

self,f0xfikm,t1_f0x737i,1569031024.0,"Thank you really for the reply. I'm seeing a therapist every couple weeks now it just hasn't helped. I know about having to try different therapists too because this is #6 now. Really sucks. I've only liked one therapist I had but she was just a grad student doing an internship so I could only see her for a while.



Just really frustrating when you've tried meds, therapy and everything else you're supposed to do and it hasn't worked"
self,f0x11cl,t3_d720t2,1569018627.0,I'm 20 and relate to a lot of what you said. I've been depressed for years and nothing has seemed to help. Made me drop out of college. I don't feel any purpose or direction either right now
self,f0wz0vs,t1_f0wy6fq,1569017060.0,"It's just hard. No matter what job I've had I think about it 24/7. If I'm not at work I'm thinking about it dreading the next time I have to go. Or trying to recover from how tired I am from working, or preparing for the next shift. I've never had a job I liked (and don't think I ever will) but even the ones I've hated the least still consumed pretty much all of my thoughts"
depression,f0v5hu3,t3_cml6ni,1568964738.0,I can't post here and nobody will say why
self,f0v0yng,t1_f0v0ud5,1568958326.0,That's just not enough for me and I don't think it is for anyone
self,f0v0y3p,t1_f0v0l7c,1568958306.0,Yep exactly
self,f0v0xlf,t1_f0v0pkq,1568958289.0,It's a good idea but that's not attainable for so many people and I don't think it will be for me. No interests I've ever had have been something I could make money off of. And after having a lot of different jobs that were really different already I end up hating all of them
self,f0pzjpm,t3_d608p6,1568851006.0,It's good that you posted. I'm close to the same place and posting on reddit has been somewhat helpful
StopSelfHarm,f0o2or8,t3_d3epyg,1568791737.0,"No I relate to you for sure. When I've cut I do like you said and just try to cover it to hide it, when I've burned and there isn't the obvious sign of blood I kinda just leave it"
hiphopheads,f0o2l0t,t1_f0h8ly0,1568791575.0,Sounds like a plan
StopSelfHarm,f0o1mdb,t1_f0hbwwl,1568790090.0,Thank you I really appreciate it. It's hard to find any reason to even stay alive right now so the care means a lot
NoStupidQuestions,f0nw4om,t1_f0nw2cz,1568783013.0,Yes it's not great pay but I have a job
hiphopheads,f0h86eh,t1_f0h82ko,1568615233.0,"I'm trying to get to know Mac better anyway, so thank you. And I'll check your other rec"
