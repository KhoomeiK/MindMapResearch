TalesFromYourServer,flf0sme,t1_flemb62,1585095513.0,"Oof my boyfriend did this but with my tanning bed. He then ripped into the lady when she said something rude about the cashier while I was gone. He shows no mercy when people are rude to others, I always loved that he is not scared to step in and help (aka stand up for our fellow retail wage slaves)."

camping,eywjxyv,t1_eyv8wbl,1567531215.0,"Yes we did! It was absolutely gorgeous. We even saw some seals in the water. It was freezing though. 

I couldnâ€™t believe the spot we got when we got there. It was 2 years ago when the mud slide happened so we had to take a tiny one way dirt road to get to the campground."

publix,erwi6k7,t1_erwi0jk,1561344353.0,"They remodeled it last year to be like this so I donâ€™t think they are ever going to change it. One person on subs, one person on slicers, one person on kitchen/hotcase and if weâ€™re lucky with no callouts one person on the floor. Weâ€™re not even a small store, our customers just know us as a slow deli now."
publix,erwdboi,t1_erw97ko,1561340274.0,"Your kitchen area doesn't have customers? Our kitchen is in the front so you have to run the hot case and do kitchen at the same time. Oh...and it's right by the only entrance/exit so everyone tracks oil through the whole deli.   


I think corporate just hates us."
