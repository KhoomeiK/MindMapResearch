bulletjournal,f13szof,t1_f13qpcd,1569164730.0,"Aww thanks! 80 gsm seems to be a very helpful Google search term (or Amazon search term). Since I live in India I doubt Michael's will ship to me, but I looked at Amazon India and there's a Menorah notebook with 160 pages and 90 GSM that is Rs. 255 ($2.58) I am calling that a good find, Waltz. Thanks again :)

For 80gsm, my options can include a Rs. 175 [dot grid notebook](https://www.amazon.in/Archmesh-Notebook-Natural-Shade-7x9-6inches/dp/B07K77WR36/). That's 2.48 dollars :) 

For the time being, I have Classmate Drawing books that I kinda am itching to practice my calligraphy in. [Here's a link](https://www.amazon.in/Classmate-Drawing-Book-170x245mm-Unruled/dp/B00HYS50QU)	to these things, and I know they are not technically for bullet journaling but I have like four of these. They have thick paper and I am kinda wondering if I should just start in these? They wouldn't cost me anything and I could always start a new one in January, for the new year. 

I am so sorry for my giant reply, I am a compulsive googler who just... doesn't know when to stop. Can't for the life of me find a listing that tells the GSM of these drawing books though. They are thick!"

Feeling all warm and toasty (till the trolls come out) with this warm welcome. Need to install the app on my phone I guess.  


Re the free luck you're passing on : Ah thanks. I need it. There's like 400 pages left to write in this project file. By hand. Fml. I think the stress of this drove me to consider something so creatively pretty as bullet journals (what's the verb y'all use? Journalling?)."
bulletjournal,f13ggx7,t1_f1387by,1569160098.0,"Thank you Jedi Master Anna. Currently, for anyone interested, I can tell you the cheapest brush pens and fineliners Indian Rupees can buy. (Indian as in an actual one from India, not Native American).

Because I just found some cheap-ass pens to start with, and YouTube and Instagram both convinced me they can be used to brush letter and doodle respectively. Excited to buy and start... Fricking exam!

So... the name of the game for me is C H E A P, in case you couldn't tell. I don't wanna spend too much and regret not following through later, in case my mind flits away from this new obsession.

Can someone here tell me what the least GSM I should be accepting in my ""sort low to high"" list is. Like, the minimum GSM where you can consider the journal worth our lofty Force..."
