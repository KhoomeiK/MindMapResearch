BPDmemes,fkemr21,t1_fke8cnj,1584116391.0,"Well, there are no meds specifically made for treating bpd so we usually get antidepressants or antipsychotics, with varying levels of effectiveness.

Right now I'm taking paroxetine, which is an antidepressants and I've been taking it for quite a while. I don't really like it because it fucks with literally everything in your body and if you take more than like 10mg you get horrible constipation and other great stuff like a complete inability to orgasm. The reason I still take it is because the withdrawal is so incredibly painful that I'm basically forced to take it. 

 I used to take quite a lot of seroquel, which is an antipsychotic and univerally hated by the entire bpd community for its massive weight gain side effect. I also suffer memory loss because of this drug. Stay away from this one unless you want to turn into a fat zombie with anmesia. 

Sometimes I take carbamazepine, which is usually used to treat people with seizures but its also prescribed to manage manic depression. I hate carbamazepine because it never works for me. Also apparently, according to my psychiatrist, if you get pregnant and give birth while on this drug theres a big chance your child will have spina bifida. 

The first med I was ever prescribed was risperodone, which is an antipsychotic and usually prescribed for shizophrenia. It did make a difference but I'm pretty sure it gave me literal brain damage. I didn't help that I was just 17 when it was prescribed to me."

Maybe we should look towards the Independent scene for good misophonia rep but mainstream Hollywood is not the place at all.

Edit: Oh oh oh I just remembered very good scene portraying misophonia in film which was in that Brian Wilson biopic Love and Mercy.
