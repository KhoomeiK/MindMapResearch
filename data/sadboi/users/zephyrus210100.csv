You should definitely take the culture and the people you want to be surrounded with into account too.  

Going into Doshisha means that you will be surrounded with mostly Japanese students (even though they have a fair share of Chinese/Taiwanese/Korean students in their Japanese-based programs too) and you will mostly be speaking in Japanese (good chance to put your N1 to practice!).  This will definitely be helpful if you were to continue working in a Japanese company.

In addition to that, Kyoto is a great city and I personally think that the perfect balance between traditional/modern makes the learning and living experience much more interesting.

APU is definitely more foreign student-friendly. AFAIK, most of the foreign students seem to be able to find study abroad opportunities easily. My APU friends have also told me that their career center is super helpful. Assuming if you're also fluent in English, going to Beppu sounds like the better choice for the long term. You definitely would not have a problem in both socializing with your peers and in the learning process."
