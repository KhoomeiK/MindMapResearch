Again, the vast majority of people were not raised vegan, but instead decided to change themselves. People like you make us look like assholes.

That’s a much bigger picture than the average person you call a carnist, or whatever. Animal agriculture is a huge problem because of capitalism, federal government, and mainstream advertising. I’ve ‘turned’ countless people vegan (I managed a vegan restaurant) by being kind, informative, and genuine, and I hear time and time again from those SAME PEOPLE about how they were initially turned off to the idea by someone with the same idea as you.

I don't mean to write off what you said as if it's something you're responsible to block out. That's so much easier said than done, of course. But I know for me at least, improvement comes by exploring myself and figuring out who I am and what I stand for. I come from an abusive home (especially emotionally abusive) and the best thing for me was to keep steady communication with people who aren't always on offense. Watch YouTube videos about things you like, listen to podcasts, make things. You'll build yourself and become more ingrained with who you are and what is important to you. And remember, the hurtful words aren't because you're a bad person. People are hurtful because they are frustrated and hurt themselves. You keep being a good person and being kind and maybe you'll even teach them all a thing or two!
