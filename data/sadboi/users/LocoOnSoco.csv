The general rule when green sculpting is there shouldn‚Äôt be any yellow or worse slope in the 3x3x3 (9 grid square) surrounding your pin placement. Always play test for this before you publish."
GemsofWar,fp8g2cc,t1_fp7jhle,1588391383.0,Nice. I‚Äôve been on the Zuul Goth grind since forever. After striking out last week I managed to pull one from a vault key I got from the faction event. I need 9 more. I‚Äôd guess November at this rate.

blackmagicfuckery,fdqb3ql,t3_emiwf0,1578661734.0,This happens to me when I play Guitar Hero/Rock Band for a bit. Look at pretty much anything after that and it looks super trippy for about 30 seconds.

thegolfclub,fauqctu,t1_faunkfa,1576351228.0,"Yeah I‚Äôve unfortunately tried this method as it seems to be the only solution, sadly. There‚Äôs also the way more frequent ‚Äúvery fast‚Äù that show up arbitrarily. That‚Äôs the bigger issue for me personally that made me ultimately quit the tour. One can only take so many random duck hooks into the drink ruining a nice round."
thegolfclub,faujeur,t1_faucu99,1576348603.0,"Xbox here, it‚Äôs not even an argument. Most of us either quit the tours or just play for fun as we get a p/p once every 10 swings. I pretty much just design now."

thegolfclub,ewpw3lt,t3_cpbph4,1565650722.0,Congrats. I know the long and sometimes painful climb to approval well. It‚Äôs a great feeling.

thegolfclub,etvtzmd,t3_cdpkgh,1563244677.0,Game has been broken on Xbox since forever. TGC tours had stats after their initial qualifiers and the numbers were crazy off. PS4 was getting like 70% p/p‚Äôs to Xbox‚Äôs 40%. I quit the true sim tour as I had zero chance to compete on this console.
GemsofWar,etq8rls,t3_ccx9zz,1563076147.0,"You‚Äôre not doing anything wrong. They‚Äôre extremely rare to pull no matter what your level is. I‚Äôve been playing since launch on Xbox and never pulled one until I was somewhere around level 800. Just keep opening keys, one will pop eventually. A few lucky  ppl get their first at very low levels, but most don‚Äôt. 

Also don‚Äôt really stress it. Mythics are nice and shiny but outside of 3-4 of them, not any better than a lot of legendaries."
