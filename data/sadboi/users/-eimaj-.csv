You can watch reaction videos online and you’ll see just how much of a reaction Negan gets out of fans. He brutally murdered some fan favorites and yet people are now saying he’s the best part of the show. If that’s not charisma then idk what is.

gtaonline,fq0z5fe,t1_fq0xqg4,1589039496.0,"The title asked for any ways to get money fast so I provided the best one I know of. If OP put “no glitches/exploits allowed” in the title then I wouldn’t have shared this but I just assumed everything was fair game. The only reason I use this exploit is because Rockstar purposely make it so stressful and time consuming for players to make cash. They want to drive people towards purchasing shark cards which, from a business standpoint, I completely get. I’d rather do this exploit, get enough cash to buy some fun shit and then fuck around with the things I bought instead of spending hours and days and weeks just to be able to afford one of the things that I mentioned in my other comment. It’s a game, not a patience test so I’d rather have fun than work for ages."
gtaonline,fq0ypi7,t1_fq0tffp,1589039290.0,"I mean, no eyebrows have been raised thus far and so many people have been doing this exploit since the casino was first introduced. It’s so well known at this point and Rockstar haven’t done anything because they’d have to change the way that the game saves which would undoubtedly lead to several other problems in the game. Maybe we’re just looking at this differently but I can’t think of any reason why Rockstar would be suspicious when this exploit only affects the games saving. Everything else about it is legit. Its just stopping the game from saving any losses. The amount of cash being won is the same, it’s just not recording the losses."
gtaonline,fq0su9o,t3_gggyvi,1589037184.0,"3 card poker exploit. You need 50k (or 105k if you have a penthouse) to bet the max amount. You bet the max amount then, if you lose, close the game straight away. However, If you win, then you change your saved outfit to force a game save. Sounds more complicated than it is. Once you get the hang of it it’ll just become routine. 

It’s honestly the best money maker I’ve ever seen. I’ve been able to buy so much with it (Yacht, Bunker, Oppressor Mk2, Hydra, Hanger, Miljet, MOC, Terrobyte, Avenger, etc). Also, I don’t think Rockstar would/could ever patch it since it’s not really a glitch. As far as they’re aware, we’re just winning at poker, fair and square.

Edit: Don’t know why I’m being downvoted. OP asked for a way to make “good cash fast”, so I provided one. Other than exploits/glitches, you’ll never find a way of making “good money fast” so I don’t get how my comment isn’t relevant here. So many people have done this exploit and shared it and I didn’t see them being downvoted. Ah well, guess that’s reddit for ya."

• “He only made the threats when the mom didn’t allow him to see the child” she didn’t stop him from seeing the child. She moved away with her family AFTER he told her to “fuck off” when she tried to let him be involved in the pregnancy. Your comment makes it seem as if he just wanted to be a nice family man and the mom robbed him of that. She tried to reach out and he called her a “bitch” for it. Also, “that is not an unreasonable response” are you fucking serious???! Him making threats, after everything else he’s done, is okay just because the mother didn’t wanna let him into their lives. The dude didn’t wanna know and then just randomly showed up out of nowhere and started making threats to scare the mom. That’s “not unreasonable”?!

• I understand that people make mistakes and they deserve second chances. Thing is, OP offered him the chance to be apart of their kid’s life and he didn’t wanna know. He randomly started taking credit on social media for how cute their kid is and tried to get back with the mom. When she, understandably, didn’t wanna know, he started to make threats about custody and he tried to scare her into doubting her parental abilities. Second chances can only last so long.
