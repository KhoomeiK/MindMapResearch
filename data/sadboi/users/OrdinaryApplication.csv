This presupposes you have some sort of aspirational mentality or something. What about those you have nothing and their head is just empty. It also presupposes that the only obstacle standing between you and ''greatness'' is you, and that's not necessarily true when you live in a world built upon systemic social inequalities."

Start by getting the hell out of that shithole. Personally cutting off ties with that asshole, meant struggling to get by financially but it's worth it, not having him around makes all the difference.

depression,f87m22e,t3_dz9nrr,1574336859.0,When I mention my feelings or my state of mind etc it's either people stay silent or don't comment and then change the subject or I'm forced to do that cause it's obvious they feel super uncomfortable.  Other times they respond with like vague statements thinking that they know I feel or what I need to get better. And the times when I open up are very few cause everyone likes to talk so much about themselves but they don't want to listen to me. I don't know if it has to do with most individuals not knowing how to handle situations like these or everyone is so caught up in their own problems and are ok with having more superficial interactions.

It's hard for me to explain cause i've never done therapy before and I feel super exposed and like I honestly don't have the energy to go through that.  I'll be going again next week and see what happens in the process. What are you scared of most?"
