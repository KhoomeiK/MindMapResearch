I’ve also had other out patient operations and never reacted this way. My boyfriend got nitrous at the dentist for a deep cleaning and then drove himself home 30 min later.

I was happy that I could feed myself and my son nutritious meals and that I had health care and those two things were not an ongoing stress for me. I never felt any shame because it never occurred to me to feel shame. I qualified for the benefits, I fought for the benefits, and they enabled me to improve my life so I no longer needed them. That’s what they are there for.

I was lucky there was no money diaries to tell me I should be ashamed. I feel bad that people feel embarrassed using these benefits. I am happy to pay taxes to help someone feed their kids and work to improve their lives.

MoneyDiariesACTIVE,fi7w299,t3_f6yb4z,1582229216.0,"Today's MD is in a particularly difficult/unique situation.  Her kids are young and require a lot of attention, she only has them 4 or five days a week so I can understand that when she has them she is focused heavily on them, and she works an extra job.  I was surprised and proud of her when she mentioned that she needed her time and didn't seem to feel any guilt about it.

As someone who has been a single parent twice in my life (when my first son was born and now that I've divorced my second son's father), yes I have been exhausted and struggled but I have always found time for myself be it the gym, dates (when I was in that mode), occasional girls weekend away, trips with my husband when I was married etc.  I simply cannot function as a good mother (or employee, girlfriend, friend) if my entire life is focused on my children's activities.  Yes, I occasionally have guilt when I go away and don't take my children with me but they love it when Grandma comes to stay with them and I do plan a couple of trips with them a year.  

I love my kids, always wanted kids, couldn't imagine my life without them but I am simply not built to lose myself in them and the pressure to live your life revolved around your children that some people think women should have is ridiculous.  I was a person for 23 years before I had them so that doesn't just stop.  Likewise, I'm not always going to be there to hold their hand, stimulate them, and plan what they do 24 hours a day so they need to learn to be their own person and function in different environments.

Bottom line, if you don't want to lose your identity and become just a mom, you won't.  It begins with cutting yourself some slack and recognizing that it is healthy to continue doing what made you happy before you had children."
