mentalillness,fqao5id,t3_ghrsbg,1589222381.0,I’m here if you’d just like someone to rant to! I’m also in quite the tough place right now and sometimes it feels good to have someone that gets it.

It’s not the same, but I recently really got into gaming and it made me happy - and then it made me mad. I was furious that I had went and found a reason to live because it made that decision to end it all so much harder. It’s funny how a reason to live can cause so much sadness."

I have her now and she definitely makes me happy at times, but there’s next to nothing stopping me from doing it now. My hope is gone."
