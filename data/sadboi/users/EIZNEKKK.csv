A few days later I got sick and I shat my pants in my sleep. A teenager who should be capable of shitting on the toilet shat their pants.

I’m not quite far from your age but just from reading how you feel, it seems like you’re excelling academically. It may not reach your mother’s standards but it sure does reach mine. I know it’s hard to not lose yourself in the process but remember who you are. Remember to take breaks and just breathe once in a while. You’re only human, it’s okay to slack off once in a while. You deserve it. You work hard for it. You’re doing amazing and even if you don’t have the best grades, you’re doing your best and that’s enough."
SuicideWatch,fqh6550,t3_gins3m,1589369016.0,I’m sorry you have to deal with disingenuous people. It’s definitely not a good feeling when you feel like there’s nobody you can really rely on. I’ve been there too. “Friends” will say they care and then immediately push your feelings aside once you tell them. I just keep it to myself rather than telling others.
