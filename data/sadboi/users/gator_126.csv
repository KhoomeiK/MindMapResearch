Mostly I try to avoid caffeine or alcohol when I feel like this or find something to do to take my mind off of it.  Doesn’t always work well but it’s something"

I have figured out a couple things that help: 
1) drink lots of water 
2) have something to do the next morning (even like going for a run or a show you want to watch) 
3) drink less the night before :/"

LawSchool,fftg4he,t3_ev58s2,1580219575.0,"I did about the same my 1L year, which sucks because big law mostly cares about your 1L grades. But I ended up getting a government job that helped improved my writing skills a lot. And then worked last semester at non profit that let me defer a summer position to the fall and now I’m at a small litigation firm. So grades aren’t everything to every job. 

I also was still able to do a journal and the trial advocacy team, which I would recommend doing if your grades prevent you from going moot court and law review like mine did.  I’m really glad I did because I’m on a team to compete this semester and my journal is publishing my comment. So grades are the only way to be successful in law school.  

Keep up the positive attitude :)"
