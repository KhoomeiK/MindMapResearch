CrossStitch,fqs37lp,t3_gkjoiz,1589597495.0,I loved stitching up [Botany](https://www.etsy.com/listing/772738399/botany-dark-modern-cross-stitch-pattern?ga_order=most_relevant&ga_search_type=all&ga_view_type=gallery&ga_search_query=botany+dark+cross&ref=sr_gallery-1-1&organic_search_click=1&bes=1) by TheStitchMill! It was such a fun pattern and each little plant and coffee cup felt like an achievement. It was also very easy on the wallet since it only uses 5 colour. This was the first pattern I've bought from Etsy and it was just such an upgrade from the kits I bought previously.
houseplants,fqs2cyq,t1_fqq1o3x,1589596955.0,I did the exact same. I'm still transitioning and switching all of my pots to terracotta ones gradually because I cant afford to do all of them at once lol. They all died of root rot and I probably gave them too much water each watering. Now I'm scarred and so concerned with watering I've bought a moisture meter. Thankfully all of my decorative pots were thrift finds and cost basically no money so I dont feel to bad about my mistake! We all start out as beginners!

houseplants,fpdt491,t1_fpdbjzh,1588533692.0,"I have no idea. I honestly thought it wasn't doing well because it has been getting some brown spots, losing leaves and not putting out anything new for the last few weeks. I was so happy at first because I thought the flower was a new leaf lol, then I got even happier. It's placed pretty far into my living room, but it gets lots of indirect sunlight as the days are getting super long here in Sweden. I don't water it too often, like every 1-2 weeks. I rather let it dry out fully because I've had lots of problems with overwatering. I do mist all my plants with water everyday though, to keep the humidity up :)"

My biggest tip to eliminate boredom is to make stuff into projects. Instead of just reading, set some goals for yourself, like read one book a week or make a reading list you want to get through. This will make you feel more accomplished than if you're just doing stuff for fun, and that will help most to combat the boredom. Stay safe ‚ù£"
