selfharm,f2vrfw5,t1_f2un660,1570456455.0,"Toxic masculinity can be such a detriment to that kind of stuff as well. Rooting for you as well! Find something you like doing and try and do that today, remember to breath slow and to have good food and water when you need it!"
Anxiety,f2vqwvf,t3_de35jj,1570456257.0,"Thank you everyone for your comments and responses, it’s really nice know that we aren’t alone. I really hope everyone can pull through whatever is going on in your life and come out the other end.

Stay safe everyone and you can do the thing."
Anxiety,f2vqpwa,t1_f2uxdyz,1570456187.0,I’m so sorry to hear about that... group chats should be a place for fun and letting go; not anxiety :(
Anxiety,f2uy58o,t1_f2un1u7,1570435186.0,The app is called Mindshift by the Anxiety Disorders Association of British Columbia :D It’s really great! You got this!
Anxiety,f2un5vu,t1_f2tfa4t,1570421365.0,"I think that’s the worst part. You feel incredibly tired, yet really overalert? It’s such an unhealthy thing for the brain to be in x.x. Do you have anything to help take your mind off it when it gets bad?"
lexapro,f2umsn6,t1_f2tys1r,1570421012.0,Oh yeah the brain zaps are killer. Good on ya for getting through it!
Anxiety,f2umooi,t1_f2ta3l0,1570420909.0,Stay strong too. Family can be really really stressful. Really happy that tablets are helping :) Hang in there okay? You got this :)
lexapro,f2rb8su,t1_f0fn35h,1570371480.0,"So jelly! Hahaha,. What kind of withdrawal symptoms are you having if you don’t mind me asking? It’s the one thing I’m super worried about coming off it after 3 years :’)"
Anxiety,f2r397x,t1_f2r1ds1,1570369355.0,"It’s such a clever way to help people! Gonna screen cap this to look at every now and then!

Hope you have the most amazing week, you deserve it! :D"
Anxiety,f2r30k7,t1_f2qzn3h,1570369274.0,It’s such an awful cycle and seems to counter intuitive. I’m really happy that you’ve started finding some coping mechanisms that work for you! I’m trying to take it one day at a time and downloaded an app to help track my moods and challenge my thoughts. Here’s hoping it helps!
Anxiety,f2r1861,t3_dduir3,1570368788.0,"Didn’t even realise my teeth were clenched! Thank you so much, I feel so much better right now <3"
Anxiety,f2r06hv,t3_de2wmj,1570368518.0,"Oh my god, are you me? I feel that way every single day at work. I’ve had some really bad experiences with work which haven’t helped. It can be really really tough constantly thinking that you’re going to mess up and feel that potential humiliation that accompanies it.

While I don’t have much advice that will instantly fix it, I find doing quick little breathing/meditation exercises when I’m in the bathroom helps if I’m have a really bad anxious time. 

Perfectionism is an absolute terror and really makes you feel like you’re doing something wrong always. I guess try and focus really strongly on something you did right that day and at the end of the day have a diary to write down all the things you achieved :)

Hang in there, and I wish you all the best of luck at your job!"
Anxiety,f2qz3q9,t1_f0k1rbf,1570368175.0,You should try some different and interesting green tea flavours! I found one that has a chocolate tinge to it with rice bubbles and it’s sooooo good <3
selfharm,f2qwnkv,t3_de1gq5,1570367419.0,"Gosh that sounds really tough and I really feel for you! I just wanna day that I believe in you and that you can do it! If you ever have any really really big urges please don’t hesitate to come back here and find support.

Just think about how fantastic it’s gonna be to swim around and I’m the water. The feeling of weightlessness and the sound of silence. You’re going to have a blast and all the hardship will be worth it! 

Take care and we all believe in you!"
selfharm,f2quuc9,t3_de2i3h,1570366916.0,"God do I feel that some days. Been recovering from surgery so I’ve been at home a lot doing nothing so I find myself having it in the back of my mind a lot. Found myself playing with a knife and just lightly tracing it on my skin or (as of today) playing with a lighter and hovering it over my skin.

Longwinded answer but yes, it’s almost like it’s a moment of clarity and control for me? If that makes sense?"
AdultSelfHarm,f2pugzo,t3_ddwciz,1570350593.0,"I’m 23 myself and still self harm, so it’s definitely not something exclusive to younger people. But I definitely do feel a little alone at times since like you said, it seems like the articles are about younger people, so it can really tough x.x

 All I can say if you’re not alone, and to take it one day at a time, and if you SH try not to beat yourself up. Proud of you for reaching out and hang in there *hugs*"
selfharm,f2hikmy,t1_f2gcsr3,1570244057.0,"It’s really tough, society can be an absolute ass sometimes. But it’s nice to know we are not alone, hang in there!"
selfharm,f2hiamn,t1_f2fmtp1,1570243960.0,"Heh that sounds like a good strategy, I’ll give that a go :) Thank you <3 Just gotta try and not beat myself about it and remind myself that mental illness isn’t failure (no matter how hard it is to believe when you’re down)

Congratulations for being able to say “used to” by the way, I’m super proud of you!"
selfharm,f2hhto0,t1_f2fna3y,1570243795.0,God do I feel that. It’s almost like you feel scared it’ll change your relationship with them or something? All those questions can become exhausting and you worry about them leaving you (for me at least). We just have to try and take it one day at a time. Hope you can get through it man :)
