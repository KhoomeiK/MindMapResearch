wholesomememes,fr28e7r,t3_gm6q1x,1589832915.0,"This varies pretty wildly in Canada. I live on the west coast (in BC) and while psychiatry and medication is covered, therapy is not. This has lead to a pretty significant issue where those who need therapy are instead medicated. In my case I was consistently over-medicated on life threatening psychiatric medications (MAOI's) instead of given the talk therapy, which was both less effective than, and more expensive than simply seeing a therapist. I left psychiatric care after a series of seizures and several month long migraines. I was diagnosed with serotonin syndrome a half a year later by my neurologist, and I pay $170/hr out of pocket for my therapist. While I believe Canadian health care is some of the best in the world, it is a far cry from perfect, and still consistently fails to meet the needs of those with mental illnesses."

Then I changed how I played. Wouldn't let certain stats more than halfway empty, tried to keep my sim comfortable at all times, and put my sim to bed when she was in a lot of pain. Lots of maintenance, and limiting how I live my life. Lo and behold, she's much less uncomfortable, and after incorporating some of the things I learned from the Sims, I am too."

I'd try to connect members of anonymous (white hats) about this issue. A few skilled hackers can get you all the evidence you need for a journalist, submit evidence of corruption in the courts, or maybe for blackmail (although I don't advocate that either). Extensive surveillance in your area might turn up something interesting.

Years ago, maybe 15, I remember my Catholic Church taking on corruption pertaining to Canadian mining companies outside of Canada. It may still be a thing, and getting the Catholic Church on your side would be helpful. Additionally, a letter writing campaign to Canadian mining regulatory bodies, provincial leaders, or hell, even the Prime minister of Canada's office might get things moving.

If there's one thing Canadians hate, it's other Canadians acting poorly. Post your story on Canadian subreddits for now, and let that anger snowball.
