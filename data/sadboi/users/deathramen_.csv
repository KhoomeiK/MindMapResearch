TrueChristian,fm9fg8v,t1_fm9eny7,1585867644.0,"Okay so here's my definition of strict dogma. It's core beliefs in the faith, like on the Jesus is the Son of God level. Those can not be changed by any council or Pope. Many Pope's have said wrong things about less strict dogma, which are open to change. Pope Francis said atheists could go to heaven, yet I'm sure we both know that it isn't true. If a Pope says something untraditional or against scripture, it's not seen as infallible. The beliefs that the Bible outlines for salvation are (mostly):

Accepting Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior, Keeping the commandments, And following Jesus' teaching

And therefore, Protestants are under the umbrella of salvation and if a Pope or council says that they're not it can be considered fallible and not scriptural. While the Catholic Church is the church of the Apostles, the Catechism strictly says that it is a Theology of the church that non Catholics are saved.  And that's taken from many sources and therefore is put in the Catechism which is, again, the book of Roman Catholic Church Theology."
TrueChristian,fm9eige,t1_fm9e46s,1585867098.0,"Any persecution of people on things such as that are unacceptable. And I 100% disagree with any form of it.

TrueChristian,fm9dysb,t1_fm9cerh,1585866784.0,"No, only strict dogma can't change. The Council of Florence is a group of still failible people with authority at the time. Any council can be overruled by later authority as long as it isn't strict tenets of the faith. Another thing to think about is that the Protestant Reformation occured way after the Council of Florence ended. And before that there really weren't any churches away from the Catholic one, so at the time of the Council of Florence, leaving the Church basically meant leaving Christianity. So that's why the Catechism, as the actual book of Church Theology, is a more powerful authority and takes precedent. Because even councils are taken into account in the Catechism."
TrueChristian,fm9caz5,t1_fm9bdv4,1585865844.0,"Yes. Here's the quote from section 818:

""However, one cannot charge with the sin of the separation those who at present are born into these communities [that resulted from such separation] and in them are brought up in the faith of Christ, and the Catholic Church accepts them with respect and affection as brothers . . . . All who have been justified by faith in Baptism are incorporated into Christ; they therefore have a right to be called Christians, and with good reason are accepted as brothers in the Lord by the children of the Catholic Church."""

TrueChristian,fm9c08g,t3_ftsmn9,1585865673.0,"The Catechism is a recent document, having revisions even in the 20th century. The council of Florence ended in the 15th century, so as a more recent authority, taking documents from the Vatican and other sources, so therefore is more of an authority."

Catholicism,fm6400z,t1_fm63cfq,1585785797.0,"I mean, in the Catechism it does say that we are to treat those outside of the Church as brothers and sisters in Christ, so that leaves it up to interpretation. And also, the Eastern Orthodox has claim to Apostolic Succession, making it its own Church. It's another branch of original tradition going back to Jesus, so therefore, it can be considered a fair way to God. Many Catholics have this view. Perhaps that Catholicism is a more in line way, but Eastern Orthodoxy does fit into that Apostolic Orthodox Category. The Roman Catholic Church doesn't have sects, either way."

However, everything has an opposite reaction to it, so therefore, evil must exist, and this is cultivates by man and our sin. We do not believe that God is the figurehead of evil, that's what Satan is. The good Christian God wouldn't force people into repentance, so maybe, when you come here to knowingly act like that just to show off how ""logical"" you are for being an agnostic, maybe ask us what our God is really like, instead of coming here with the intention to be arrogant and edgy."

So, Protestants are the only ones with true denominations. Orthodox kinda does, but it's mostly region based. Also, Roman Catholic is just another name for the Catholic Church."

philosophy,fi5qcku,t1_fi5p91l,1582168427.0,"Yes. The key words there are ""feels"" and ""even if they know it's not factual."" Anyone can feel anyway they want to about morality. But is there a code already set in stone that can not be changed because it's as if it's the framework for society. I argue yes (obviously). Why is it wrong to kill people? Why is it wrong to steal? Why is it wrong to cheat? Even though there are people who are unafflicted by doing these things, or having them happen, it's usually do to some sort of mental affliction or being softened to them due to exposure. For someone's moral code to be ""not factual"" there has to be a center for what is, and my point is that while people why think what they wish, there is always moral fact, and an overlying moral law."
philosophy,fi5o65o,t1_fi5nkvm,1582167165.0,"There are two different schools of thought around this topic. Throughout this post I've mentioned this. It's between Theism and Naturalism. Depending on what side you view it from is what will dictate your conclusion. It's what will put a slight tint on where you start in your deductive thought. On Naturalism, the reason for a society to thrive is to keep members of the population alive to forward a species or humans in general. With Theism, a reason for society to thrive is so that people may be pious and follow the law of God/the gods they follow, and in believing this they put a purpose to themselves. While Naturalism has a purpose prescribed by nature and survival of the fittest."

philosophy,fi5mtei,t1_fi5md49,1582166421.0,"Your point stands true, but in a different discussion. My point is which one is more morally safe than the other and should be implemented. However if you'd like to talk about this then sure. Again this whole concept belongs in a Naturalist vs. Theist debate. Because with Theists there is an overlying law put in by God and on Naturalism the moral law is put in place by survivability and what will keep the species alive and healthy."
philosophy,fi5m5lz,t1_fi5jyx7,1582166033.0,"Naturalism is a belief that there is nothing beyond the material world and universe that we can see. It takes a very pro-scientific stance. Nihilism also takes this stance as well as taking it a step further and denying moral principles as well. The idea that there is no meaning or purpose to life. So to answer your first question, Naturalists deny religious (most) principles and Nihilists do the same while also under the belief that life is pointless. To answer your second question, since Naturalists only believe as far as we can see based on Scientific theory, they don't reject moral principles. They only dispute with religion on the origin of these principles, while Nihilism dismisses the significance of them all together. I hope I answered your questions."
philosophy,fi5izb7,t1_fi5gh8b,1582164171.0,"You definitely fall into the Naturalist camp again. With a Theist perspective, depending on which God/gods you believe in, there are certain reward/punishment systems. The idea that whether you followed morality as a society or individual is irrelevant contradicts the reward/punishment system. A lot of the time an agnostic worldview is better for philosophy because you usually come without a theological bias, causing you to think deductively instead of inductively, which can lead to a more clear conclusion on the issue or topic at hand."
philosophy,fi5fvgu,t1_fi5ds6y,1582162206.0,"I do agree with you here, however I must say that there are much better ways of saying how subjective morality is detrimental just by defending the idea that a set of moral laws based on a common sense foundation, consideration for happiness, and human rights is safer. Not all people are fit mentally to make these decisions for themselves. And when we think about it, ""something making you uncomfortable"" is not a reason to argue against it on a moral basis. However I will not disagree that there are ups and downs to both sides of the argument. It's all about deciding which side is safer for the community at large that is in question."
philosophy,fi5f8xf,t1_fi5e77b,1582161798.0,"If you would like me to clarify, my use of the word universal here was meant to describe an ""all-encompassing"" (over humans/living beings) moral law designed by humans based on common sense/what helps us survive in a happier state. On the idea of morality being ""outside of the minds of intelligent life,"" this is another thing left up for debate amongst Theists and Naturalists. Where God might be considered in It's own category and that which They decree being a ""universal moral law"" like you think of it as. Where They put in place a law, and since God would be It's own variable, is outside of the normal ""intelligent life"" category. However, I do apologize for any confusing rhetoric or leaving my idea susceptable to misconstruction."
philosophy,fi5auz4,t3_f6jpf9,1582158865.0,"Well, with or without idea of Theism, where a God or gods have set in place a set of moral values, or even without it, set moral values are a fact in certain areas of life. And the debate shouldn't be on what defines morality between universal law or the individual, but what sets it in place. There are inherent dangers to one person or a set of people ""making their own rules"" in a sense. Having a set guide of moral rules (while always up for debate of course), is simply safer than moral subjectivity. Because if we leave it up to the individual or group, some may not have the correctly guided mindsets to think this way. In no way am I bashing people with AntiSocial Personality Disorders when I say this, but take Sociopaths and Psychopaths. Sociopaths can ignore moral compasses, and Psychopaths don't have them at all. It is in situations like those where we do need a ""universal moral code"" of sorts. Whether you believe that was developed through say Evolution or Creation."
