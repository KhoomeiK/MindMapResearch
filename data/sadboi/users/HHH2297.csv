Am aceasta cutie minunata, care se presupune ca da 1000mbps, dar care aparent e de toata jena. Nu pot lucra/juca de delay. Stie cineva care ar fi routeru care ar match-ui cu ce am eu? Am cumparat unul da nu intra nu stiu ce cablu in chestia asta alba. Sorry de limbaj da nu ma pricep absolut deloc in domeniu. Vreau doar sa imi meara la viteza optima. Merci :)"

Indeed, life is though and we are living crazy times but still there is hope somewhere. We need to know where to look for it. We are all gonna die but let‚Äôs make the most of it. Always wondering what‚Äôs the purpose of life and the result is always the same: there is not a purpose (or not yet). Life became so weird as the years have passed but I still believe there is hope/sense somewhere... stay strong and positive. Do not hestitate to text me privately if you need to chat with someone."

depression,fn7xd62,t1_fn7wmo8,1586729538.0,"Thank you so much for your time. I can still concentrate on video games, series, I also have a job but these things are just coming randomly. The thing is, when I realised I‚Äôm i to something like really deep (being really focused in a game) and then coming back to my thoughts is pretty scary because I feel like I lost control. Being fully focused is not normal to me anymore. Thinking about bad things is ‚Äúbeing the new normal‚Äù. I ve been scrolling through some topics and giving some replies to people and it really helped me to clear my mind. During the night I am pretty good. During the day I am like a semi-zombie. 

In regards to writing, my doc adviced me as well to start writing, especially philosophy (‚Äúmy‚Äù philosophy)"
depression,fn7w84m,t3_fzwzl3,1586728882.0,"I used to be like you, i graduated highscool and had been in a realtionship for a year and a half. Nothing happened between us and started univeristy as a ‚Äúvirgin‚Äù. I met a girl, hanging up with her several times and then the moment came. Me and her, naked in the bed. She didn‚Äôt know I was a virgin, neither my closest friends or family. I was ashamed of the whole situation because I knew what it s going to happen. After like 8-10 seconds inside her, I was done. Started with apologizes using the excuse ‚Äúi didn t have sex in a while‚Äù and then she told me: i knew it from the start you are a virgin, but I am here to help you through this. You don‚Äôt have to be ashamed. All my life was about this moment, I was so stressed about it but looking back now at 23 years old... hiding all of these from my parents, friends... come on bro, we all know we are all going to experience this sooner or later. Life is not about sex. Life is about the person you have next to you. My best friend is 22 years old and he only had sex once. So what? He s still my best friend and I m going to support him no matter what. Those who judge you are just frustrated people with nothing else better to do. You got this bro, you can go through this. These are sooo superficial things... don‚Äôt worry about it :)"
depression,fn7tkc1,t1_fn7ruav,1586727354.0,"We are all crazy in a way or other. I do feel, see things very good but overthinking became a habit rather than a thought of something in particular. I really don‚Äôt know how to explain my feelings in english. I did see a doc, she told me that I have little anxiety triggered by that fucking thing but I do need to organise my thoughts. I think that everyone will experience a moment like this in his/her life, realising that you are just a temporary human being and it freaks you out... I always had a negative mind but this is absolutey next level. Look, while writing these lines everything was super chill and now I am back in my shitty mood. I am so pissed off for the fact that I cannot put into words these fucking feelings, damn...

edit: or are these only thoughts? what if I will not think of this while trying to ‚Äúlive‚Äù? The tricky part is that you cannot leave your thoughts behind... they are hunting you"
