Anxiety,f1a8upu,t3_d85862,1569287911.0,"okay literally i always have pee anxiety. i feel the need to pee in stressful situations or really any situation at all. i’ve heard bladder training can help. my problem is i don’t actually pee once i get to the toilet, it’s just the urge. it’s so annoying. i deal with it mostly when i lay down for sleep. i suspect i had ocd, i’ve always peed about five times before going to bed without actually releasing any urine. you’re not alone."
adhd_anxiety,eztss0u,t3_d1xkjs,1568137822.0,"i was the same way! all my friends smoke, and i would be the only person in rotation who was like “just skip me.” i knew that if i smoked i would be even more of a nervous wreck. however, i started cymbalta about three months ago, and now i can smoke whenever i want and be totally fine. i can smoke around people, i can smoke by myself, heck i even show up to my very religious families house super baked. i also take adderall on some days for school as i also have adhd, and i choose not to smoke on those days."
