I’ve been trying to grow it out, I’ve been to multiple stylists but nobody can seem to fix it. 

The stylist advised the student to put on a pure brown tone or something like that and left it on my hair for a while. 

The next day I noticed that the ends were literally black (faded to a dark brown now) and the orange looked like it hadn’t been touched at all. They were supposed to fix the week after but shut for the Coronavirus, so now I’m stuck like this aha. I was gonna home dye it but don’t want to make it any worse aha."
