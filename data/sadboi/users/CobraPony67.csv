Most are simply afraid of going to get care because of the risk of being infected.  However, they can risk getting very sick or die in their own homes."

The people who went to this church should all be identified and if they come to the hospital, require them to pay up front, make the church pay, or deny them all together.  They are risking other people's lives in the name of their religion."
