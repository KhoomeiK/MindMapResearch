Lots of questions to sort out with a lawyer. Some will help you free during the 1/2 hr they usually give to new potential clients. 
Like how many yrs or months were you and Mom living with boyfriend? Was it a common law union? Promise of marriage? Was your Mom paying 1/2 the rent? Are they both on a mortgage or a lease? Does she have her car or does he? Is she driving a car registered to him? Will he sic the police on her, saying she drove off and stole it? Get all this straight so he can’t come at you with a warrant for arrest. 
Then, if he abused her, there are govt run facilities as well as private organizations, that house women of domestic abuse and give them safehouse sanctuary, and help them get employment, back on their feet. 
You might want to file criminal or civil charges. Ask the lawyer/s.
Set up several appointments with attorneys to ask your questions and get their advice and a clearer picture of what you want to do. Meanwhile, call a state agency and private groups that help battered women and their families find a safe place to live (for free) and go from there. Good luck!"
