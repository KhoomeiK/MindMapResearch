I did get my answer!!! Thank you üòÅ"

tax,ffdxxi3,t1_ffdxlfx,1579831682.0,"Ok. I was aware of the new w4 change but like you said, it'll only be beneficial to those fill them out them accurately. 

Awesome!! Definitely the answer I was looking for!!! Thank you SO much."
tax,ffdx4c6,t1_ffdvmji,1579831104.0,Ok. Thank you for your help. I think I might have found my answer else where!! Your information did help me to that answer.
tax,ffdwg3q,t1_ffdvx4t,1579830621.0,"Ok. This sounds like an answer I am looking for. 

All of my w4s were the same...it makes sense that the other companies made mistakes. Because according to pub15T, I should not have had taxes taken out of any of the income from those employers, correct? Which is where my confusion is coming from."
tax,ffdvzc7,t1_ffdvcce,1579830293.0,"1. You're right...i assumed you look. My mistake. 
2. I have not dismissed anyone. I understand now why I owe because of the comments that have been posted. The only one I'm have a hard time with is you because you haven't given me information that I don't already know. But that's ok. You don't know what I know. 

But you're still an asshole because you commented on my skills as a Tax Preparer based on a question I asked...i don't dismiss that comment."
tax,ffdunyo,t1_ffdujcj,1579829360.0,Calm down...i added to my comment asshole.
tax,ffdubqh,t1_ffdmxc5,1579829121.0,"Basic tax knowledge. It doesn't answer my current question. That's scratching the surface. I've gotten the answer to the question your information goes to. Thank you though. 

My current question, as stated some where in this thread...why did this employer NOT take taxes out but the OTHERS DID? I made significantly less else where and had taxes taken out but did not at this job, why?
Again...all my w4s are the same. 

I know why I owe money...again that's basic tax knowledge. Why does one company do it but the other doesn't. That is my question."
tax,ffdk0th,t1_ffdjs93,1579822514.0,"Yes. I'm aware of this PDF. 

My confusion comes from having other employers withholding when I made significantly less there. I've never had a job not withhold taxes."
tax,ffdjdtl,t1_ffdifzm,1579822120.0,"I don't think what I know is solely correct. I want knowledge, more information that goes beyond the surface.

Commenting on how I am as a Tax Preparer wasn't necessary ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
tax,ffdja86,t1_ffdi901,1579822059.0,Oh Duhh. I see what you mean.
tax,ffdj5ot,t1_ffdi901,1579821980.0,All my other w2s are in. This is the last w2 I put in...
tax,ffdj1d5,t3_eswraw,1579821905.0,"If yall don't have answers to my questions, don't bother commenting on my question. 

Because I'm trying to get a better understanding on something does not mean I don't know what I'm doing. Knowledge is power. Whether you you're a CPA or a regular basic Tax Preparer, it does not hurt to ask questions. 

All of my jobs pulled out federal taxes EXCEPT THIS ONE. Why? If you can't answer that CARRY ON. 



I wasn't taking into consideration that my husbands income is ALSO included in that. Now I understand why I'm ""out 2k""...what I DON'T understand is why my employer didn't pull federal out and the others did. 

I also understand that there is a withholding table I can reference. Publication 15, and I know what it says....but my other two jobs who paid less took taxes. Anyone care to explain?"
tax,ffdi975,t1_ffdi0ct,1579821432.0,"How do you know what my w4 says. 

Carry on if you do not have knowledge to share."
tax,ffdi2lm,t1_ffd3d4l,1579821319.0,"Good thing I'm not filing yours. Nor would I want to. 

I'm just relaying the information I was given by the payroll dept. It obviously doesn't make any sense or I would be here TRYING TO GET A BETTER UNDERSTANDING. 

Just because I'm a tax Preparer doesn't mean I know EVERYTHING. And it CERTAINLY doesn't mean that I'm a bad tax preparer."
tax,ffdhslt,t1_ffcygt1,1579821153.0,That's what I'm starting to understand now. It's just never happened this way before. I've ALWAYS had federal taxes withheld no matter how much my paychecks during the pay period.
tax,ffdhmm5,t1_ffcy4k5,1579821052.0,"Troubling why? 

Because my taxes withheld doesn't reflect what I withheld on my w4? 
If you read the WHOLE comment you can see where I said I'm confusd. 

Carry on if you don't have knowledge to share."
tax,ffdhh1i,t1_ffcxuwk,1579820957.0,"No need to be nasty. 

I know what I'm looking at. And I know what I see. However...extra knowledge does not hurt anyone. If you don't have an answer to my question...continue on."

tax,ffcumvx,t1_ffcow1i,1579807598.0,"But I had w2s that were significantly less than this one & had federal taxes taken out...

Payroll dept just has me refer to the withholdings table but it doesn't make sense if I made less at another job & had federal taxes taken out of those paychecks."
tax,ffcu77b,t1_ffcp3di,1579807345.0,"If I was overpaid, why is it that this w2 (the last and final one I have to put into my return) is what brought it down to me owing money...

That's where I am confused..."

All together my income was about $12,000 (rounded). I also file MFJ.


If my income was just $7,000 I wouldnt be required to file."
