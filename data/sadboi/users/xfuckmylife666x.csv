My cat only ate dry food, and the bowls were always kept in the same area as the litter. When I think about it now it just makes me sad.

Most dogs are very poorly treated. They need so much love and attention, and walking that people just aren't willing to give. Most dogs I have been around love me for the sheer fact that I will give them all the pets they want. Seeing how many deprived creatures are out there breaks my heart.

DiagnoseMe,fqda9fw,t3_ghi8ep,1589284700.0,"There are different kinds of empathy. People with antisocial personality disorder and narcissistic personality disorder tend to have high cognitive empathy. That is, they can sense and read other people's feelings and have the capability of understanding it, yet cannot connect back to themselves in any meaningful way. That being said I think plenty of people without either of those diagnoses have trouble getting past cognitive empathy. Most of us have the emotional IQ of a 12 year old.

Antisocial personality disorder is characterized by disregard for other people. So someone with APD can appear to be anything, including a genuine and loving person but their motivations are completely selfish. They tend not to care about their own safety let alone the safety of others. Do you often violate the emotional and/ or physical rights of others? If you don't violate the rights of others but still do not care that other people have rights I'd be a bit worried.


I also have a hard time feeling emotions, or feeling them fully. And I used to worry about being APD but learning about r/CPTSD changed my life. I learned about emotional numbing and how that can make empathy difficult, and how a lot of people with a history of trauma worry about whether they're the ""bad"" one or not. Do you have a history of trauma?

I ask because it sounds like you have some level of care for the people you're talking about. Everyone is manipulative in some way or another. We all say and do things to help get what we want, healthy or not. It is human nature. It's when that manipulation becomes flippant or someone begins to change who they are fundamentally because of it that it becomes a problem. I just wonder if you're being a bit hard on yourself."

There is a book that recently came out about a [historically famous ftm doctor](https://fyeahhistory.com/2019/03/07/dr-james-barry-and-the-erasure-of-lgbtq-history/) that posed that he was just a woman who acted like a man in order to be a doctor. He is misgendered and dead named throughout the book. This is not true as he asked that his body not be inspected after death and was ""full time"" meaning everyone in his life knew him as a man. Trans people have been practically erased from history under the guise of sexism. Do not let them fool you. 
Edit 2: hyperlink

Trans guy/ non-binary person here. I was raised as a Jehovah's Witness. They believe that women are inherently less than men and cannot have any ""privileges"" in the congregation. My step dad would constantly criticize what I wore and tell me boys only ever think about one thing.


I worry often about whether this influences my transness. However, I had no idea I was different than any other boy until I was 6 and was scolded for repeating something another boy had said about his genitalia. Basically the evidence points to at least gender nonconformity before society and sexism could truly influence me. I also love the effects of T so far and am in a similar boat with feminity as well. I can wear more feminine clothing now that my body more closely resembles that of a cis man.


You may have to accept that you'll never really know. Would knowing change how you feel? Would you decide to detransition and deal with dysphoria because sexism influenced you? Would you be able to accept and live as a cis woman?


I think what's important is to focus on how you feel right now. How you were raised influences who you become, but it does not define who you are. An old therapist told me that yeah, maybe trauma has influenced my relationship with gender, but that does not change how I feel. While I don't find that comforting today I did at the time.


Plenty of cis people have dealt with trauma and never question their gender identity. Most cis people you ask will tell you they don't even think about their gender. If you like T, and you feel better about yourself and the world on it, you are probably trans. I know it's not easy to accept, I still struggle with it myself. Sometimes focusing just on how I feel rather than the trans label is helpful. I hope things get better for you soon. No matter what the reasoning behind your gender identity, you are 100% valid."

If I didn't get ignored, I got screamed at that I needed to go downstairs and get myself a hot wash cloth (any other time I would get screamed at for being awake and downstairs no matter the reason). 


My parents never took me to the ER or even to see our family doctor. I've had medicaid most of my life so it wouldn't cost them anything. When I was 16 my mom found out she had chiari and I finally got to go to the doctor because she was convinced I had the same thing. I don't.


My migraines were so bad that now I have a lesion on the left side of my thalamus, effecting my fine motor skills and ability to control the movement of my mouth while speaking. I have a hard time holding onto things, buttoning anything, and handling cash which is something I need for my job.


I'm 22. It's extremely embarrassing to be so young and be slurring my speech like I'm drunk in front of customers, and fumbling around trying to pick things up to scan and bag them. Seeing a doctor and getting on a preventative when they started could have saved me from going through this.

It's way too easy to fall into codependence or other unhealthy relationship patters with long-term partners. Even if it seem unnecessary, keeping boundaries like this can help to set two people apart from each other. Be a reminder that you're two separate people who, at the end of the day, don't owe each other anything. 

Idk how long you've been with your partner but expectations like this can quickly lead to resentment. And resentment will ultimately destroy any relationship. Because it represents a break down in healthy communication. Sometimes resentment is the only thing one gets to themselves, the one thing a partner can't have access to.

asktransgender,f8p1oqy,t3_e17ugm,1574694163.0,US  sizes are off. A 10-12 is considered a medium. It sucked having to pick 2x as someone whose considered average size and I'm sure plus size people had an even harder time since their answers didn't count for much.
CPTSD,f8fzcev,t3_e0krez,1574551584.0,"I can relate. I was sexually assaulted by someone I thought was a friend when I was 16. My parents sexualized me at a very young age and my mother was emotionally incestuous. Any time someone finds me sexually attractive I am repulsed with them, and myself. 


If this is a huge issue for you I would encourage you to continue working with your therapist. Look into sexual anorexia as well. If you would rather embrace this fact about yourself you could always start dating asexual people."
CPTSD,f8fxs1u,t1_f8elj49,1574551022.0,It's always recommend that you and your spouse have separate personal therapists while going through marriage counseling. If you can afford this and ever decide to give it another shot you could potentially try telling the marriage counselor you both are already dealing with childhood trauma with your separate therapists and would prefer to focus on the here and now in your marriage.
CPTSD,f8frfpk,t3_e0gmc0,1574548387.0,"Yes!!! Mine was mostly emotional. My parents always compared themselves to other shitty parents we knew and would say at least they weren't that bad. My mom made me read a child called it when I was twelve to teach me that that's the only way parents can be abusive. Not a book any child should have to read. It was horrific and traumatizing just to read. 

I struggle to validate myself constantly. My mother still to this day tries to blame my ADHD for her abuse. The disorder she told me wasn't really until she realized she could use that to rationalize her behavior. She tells me I was just to sensitive and whatnot. It is a daily struggle. 

I'm sorry you're having a hard time with this. You are completely valid and emotional abuse is just as damaging as any other form. There's actually a form of emotional abuse called emotional incest which can cause the same effects of actual incest. If you were abused by your parents I would encourage you to look into it. 

Sometimes I think it's easier to deny emotional abuse. I know I'd rather not believe it was true. Who wants to admit that their parents or partner treated them so poorly?"

migraine,f8cn96l,t3_e02orc,1574464104.0,Yes!!! When I was a kid I'd wake myself up sobbing in the middle of the night with my entire head throbbing. Now every time my head starts to hurt even a little I get panic attacks and weird flashback like phantom pains
CPTSD,f8c2u28,t1_f8byonv,1574451138.0,"The system used by the place I go is called MyChart. It's more like the records they keep on me than an actual record of my medical history. There is a section for specific diagnoses and it does not contain dysthymic disorder. If it did I could request that it be removed but even then it would stay and just list the reason I want it removed.


Just the letter sent as a referral to one of their psychiatrists says I have dysthymic disorder. It is the reason I am being referred and it is the only condition listed. It has already been sent and I don't have a way to edit or remove it from their records. 


This place is very religion oriented and even tho most people who work there aren't religious they practice the way you would expect Christians to because that's the culture and company policies are based around it. The psychiatrists I've encountered treat patients like they couldn't possibly know what's wrong with themselves or know what kind of medication would work best. Others in my life have had similar experiences there and have found slightly better treatment elsewhere. 


This is the only place my insurance has been willing to pay for. I'm poor so I can't afford to pay out of pocket for any other mental health facility. I've tried going to my primary physician but she isn't very knowledgeable about mental health care and their psychiatrist can't see me for another year.


This chart does not lay out a treatment plan unfortunately I have been mostly kept in the dark. If a therapist or psychiatrist doesn't feel like sharing their personal opinion on my diagnosis they don't have to. This is just the experience I have had. I've been on and off with this same place for about 10 (I'm 22 now) years. I was completely cut off from most of the world most of my life so I don't know how most things work which is probably why many clinicians have gotten away with treating me poorly and withholding info from me.


I will try, but I guess my point was that no matter what I say, this psychiatrist will still have seen that. They will still hold it in their mind. Studies have found that even if a lie has proven to be false, the more perceived credibility it once had, the more likely people are to still believe it to some extent. Or at least not let the truth influence them as much."
CPTSD,f8bwkag,t1_f8bq0zz,1574446980.0,"I personally don't think BPD really exists since there are 9 criteria and if you loosely fit into 5 you get the label. No other diagnosis is like that. It's a scapegoat. It's a diagnosis people get when they have too many symptoms of too many disorders to classify them as one thing or another.


BPD is caused by trauma, yet blamed completely on the victim. I have a theory that a lot of people with BPD have undiagnosed ADHD and a lot of intense, prolonged trauma along with some other things. But I'm no professional so I can't really say. I just know a lot of people are diagnosed who shouldn't be, and everyone I know irl with it has a significant history of trauma and chronic illness starting from a young age (Mom had endometriosis that spread from just outside the uterus around her ovaries and down to the middle of her thighs as well as chiari 1 malformation which is a condition in which your brain sinks into your spinal collum, and my best friend has ADHD, asthma, and has had fibromyalgia since they were a young teen). 


I've had a neurologist write in notes from an MRI that the lesion on my thalamus was from damage to my central nervous system or a disease that eats away at the mylean sheath. Yet my current neurologist tells me I'm completely fine and invalidates every neurological symptom I have, attributing it to my mental health issues or medication. It's fucked. So I understand a bit about where you're coming from. And I'm sorry you've had so many horrid experiences with the healthcare and mental health system. 

I fear people like us, those who suffer from many issues due to extensive trauma, will never get relief or real help because our problems are so complex. It's apparently very hard to study and understand how trauma warps the brains structure and function. I think because significantly more women than men deal with these problems they just don't care to try tbh."
CPTSD,f8bmu3h,t1_f8blvs2,1574440570.0,"Gah, I'm so glad I'm not alone in this. I'm sorry you've had to deal with shit clinicians tho.

What really messed me up was that she was willing to go with MDD and GAD but stopped at real issues that affect me in everyday life. If diagnoses aren't helpful then they should be considered unhelpful all around!!

Psychiatry is mostly just guesswork and clinicians act like they're God because they can make some educated guesses. What's important is a treatment plan. I don't understand why we can't just go with that model ಠωಠ"
CPTSD,f8bhdml,t3_dzvelv,1574436924.0,"Yep. I'm the oldest and suffered the worst of it until I stopped seeing my parents. I have always been and will always be the scapegoat. They used to excuse their abuse by saying the oldest is always the guinea pig. My middle sister tells me our parents still try to blame all their problems on me even though I haven't seen either of them in months.

Tw// physical and psychological abuse

I was rarely ever hit but when I was, it was bad. My mother punched me in the face a couple times and kick me down the stairs when I refused to grovel at her feet. My middle sister always stuck up for me when they would berate me and scream for hours and neither of them ever once laid a hand on her for ""talking back"". This happened regularly. Like, two to three days a week at least once I turned 12.


My middle sister has always been the favorite because she's quite. Mind you, they tell her this is a bad trait and she needs to not be like that but she is that way by their design. My youngest sister was completely ignored by them and I was responsible for raising her until I left. Now I believe they have started to use her as a proxy scapegoat, but she still does not suffer like I did. Since we spent so much time together from the time she was an infant up until about 6 she is a lot like me. They hate that and they hate her for it.


They both get to do sports they want and get new clothes every year tho. I had to literally beg to do one sport and was called a slut for it because my parents (mostly step dad) believed cheer was only for sluts. I was lucky to get clothes from Goodwill and mostly had to get hand-me-downs from my one friend for about 3 years. 


My parents are really fucked up people who have no capability of taking responsibility for their own actions. None. Whatsoever. My mom tries to blame my undiagnosed, untreated (literally because she claimed not to believe in it until it became a convenient scapegoat for her) ADHD for how she treated me. I was ""just such a difficult child"". LMFAO.

Ugh that was long, sorry! There's a ton more. I could go on for hours about how much they tried torturing me and controlling *literally* every single aspect of my life but I digress."
SuicideWatch,f8aj26y,t3_d2370x,1574398794.0,"Was it essential to add the ""because people seem to have a hard time understanding"" ? Couldn't you just say ""for clarification"" instead? People aren't stupid because the connotation of the word activism varies greatly and they want to know what you mean specifically. If one is only referring to the denotation of a word that is commonly connoted with a wide spectrum of things it should be common practice to specify that."
CPTSD,f8ai42a,t3_dzv7ie,1574397970.0,Yeah but I have ADHD so I need a lot of detail or I literally cannot process wtf I'm supposed to do. Without step-by-step instructions I am completely lost because my mind is just incapable of filling in the gaps.
