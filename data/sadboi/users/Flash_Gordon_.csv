UNC is a bigger school meaning more people competing for opportunities such as research. Emory is in a city which may have more external opportunities whereas UNC is in Charlotte NC I believe. When I visited the school, it seemed kinda secluded as most places in NC do. But, UNC will give you a more fun college experience, especially if you like to watch sports and party. But how much time will you have for that anyway if you are serious about pre med? Doing better in classes may be slightly easier here although both schools have an intelligent student body, UNC is a little bit less competitive due to them being lenient about their in-state acceptances being a public school.
