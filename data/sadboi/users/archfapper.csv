With sequential, you have to count interchanges and you never know how far the next exit is. ""I'm three exits away"" on the Thruway, for example, could be 2-3 miles (Yonkers) or 30 miles (between Newburgh and New Paltz). Plus there are sometimes suffixed exits that throw a wrench in your count. Exit 3 to Exit 5 might have an Exit 3A, Exit 4 N-S, Exit 4B, then Exit 5 for example.

Sequential exits definitely make sense on short highways in urban areas. Like the Cross County, where the highway is so short, no one's really concerned about mile markers. And no one wants Exit 1, 1A, 1B, 1C, 1D, 2, etc when they could just have 1, 2, 3, 4 A-B, 5."
