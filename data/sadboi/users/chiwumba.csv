I decided I wanted a few houseplants. So I went a bit hog wild... and got many orchids, some african violets, and a few baby plants. 

I've always had a problem with online shopping, but I was doing pretty well. Until, y'know, a pandemic. It's something I've been working on.

So I've decided to focus on videos and reading about proper care. I think it's a good hobby, but addiction is a bitch. The plants make me happy, but I'm not independently wealthy. There will always be more plants later!"

I just got my meds on Friday, and it is mind-boggling how much they help. I finally feel calm and organized. I can focus even though I'm teleworking. My therapist commented that she noticed a marked improvement in the clarity of my communication, and that was startling to hear.

It's great to finally be acknowledged."

You don't owe anyone sex. He doesn't love you, no matter how much you might love him. You can find a better connection with someone who actually cares about you, but you have to let this one go first.

The View is a start, but we need to find a way to attract the younger women who make up a lot of Warren's base. What shows or podcasts are popular in this demographic?

As a woman and an engineer, I'm more interested in data, but I'll be honest-- my older brother was the one who caused me to look into Yang.

ADHD,ewtvi7h,t3_cptx32,1565754991.0,"I think people with ADHD are impacted more, but the advent of easily accessible internet has shaped the development of our brains. I always had some trouble focusing on boring things, and remembering to turn in homework. But I could spend hours on my favorite things. For reference, I'm almost 30. I would gather that many people in this thread are around the same age.

I remember easily being able to focus on drawing or reading for hours. Now it's a struggle to focus on much of anything at times. I drink copious amounts of caffeine to be somewhat functional. I can enjoy my hobbies now that I'm on anti-depressants, but the hardest part is just getting started! I can't even play video games anymore. My brain just shuts off.

I think we are collectively rewiring ourselves to demand more hits of dopamine with the endless novelty the internet used to provide... but even that gets boring as we refresh Reddit over and over.

I have an appointment with a psychiatrist next week. But I think a lot of us need help being weaned off the constant stream of information, and relearning how to concentrate. Stimulants help us focus, but we have to still make the effort to choose what to focus on."

He deserves to get clapped if he ignores your boundaries.

As for general advice, I don't know. I suck at this too. But I would let him know that you're in a tough place, and that it's not personal but you need to leave him be until you feel better. If he can't accept that, then he's contributing to the problem."
