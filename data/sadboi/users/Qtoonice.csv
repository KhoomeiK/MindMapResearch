He clearly doesn’t have interest in that friend group anymore. People change over time and maybe he has a lot going on in his life now. I can assure you that you trying again and again won’t help either, especially after 8 years. If he changes his mind he’ll contact you. If I were you I’d just move on with my life and leave that door open but maybe just stop knocking. Also, his experience with that group may differ from yours greatly so maybe he just decided he wants to change the people around him. Not saying he’s right or wrong just maybe how he perceived the “harassment” and the “little brother” role he seems to have had."
kratom,fc16bn3,t3_efm3wt,1577309503.0,For me I barely feel anything on a full stomach. You might still feel it a tiny bit but it will take a lot longer to take effect

He said they may use it for something in the future but no plans yet. I hope they just wait let him rest for a while and when the times right we will all see it."

Since we can’t post brands here I’d recommend looking up some reviews. A lot of online retailers can’t take credit or debt cards so you may need to use a app to pay. Just be smart and don’t buy from any sites that look sketchy. Sorry for vague advice but kinda limited what I can say on here. 
Good luck !!"

modernwarfare,f6lxvwf,t3_drzhe3,1572963417.0,They’re insecure stating their own opinions. They’re afraid to have a unpopular opinion.  So they look to more “respected” streamers or youtubers for validation and/or original opinion. Same happens with music reviews. They’ll just listen to what some Fader article says you should listen to.

MacMiller,f6iv3s7,t1_f6h9sb8,1572884835.0,Not everything an artist makes is meant to be released. You think old leaked songs from 2011 mac was planning to release ? No. Same with peep or X. Sometimes they scrap entire albums bc they don’t like it and they don’t want it out. That’s why it’s gross to decide for them after they have passed. Bottom line is it’s up to his family and friends to decide what gets released. Not the fans.
MacMiller,f6iu3sr,t3_drc1x0,1572884390.0,"Yeah we all need to let his friends and family decide what’s the best move. I don’t appreciate the “fans” that say “I’m a fan so I deserve to hear all his leaks and dig through all his old shit” 
Just let his family grieve and mourn."

It feels like some gears spinoff more than a actually title game"
GearsOfWar,f5jnvdl,t1_f5hrraa,1572234001.0,This is exactly me right now. If I didn’t have some stupid blind loyalty and faith in gears I’d never keep playing this game. But here I am lol. 1% of my soul believes this game can turnaround even tho logically I know it never will. I think I just want it to so badly bc I LOVE the gears franchise. Sadly I believe it’s on its last legs if I’m being honest.
GearsOfWar,f5jnn2t,t1_f5h00po,1572233790.0,For real. I don’t get why ppl torture themselves to the point of burnout then don’t even play anymore. What’s the point of doing it then. And even if you do play it’s just different pixels on your screen. I’ll never understand the grind people suffer through to just quit in the end. Not bashing anybody tho if you enjoy it then great power on man.
GearsOfWar,f5gli01,t1_f5gkb0m,1572194562.0,Oh yeah it’s gunna be bad if they don’t change it. Just another way for them to get us to spend iron to re roll it I guess
GearsOfWar,f5gk3n8,t1_f5gip9s,1572194144.0,Yeah this works but it’s still just annoying and tedious to do. I don’t don’t mind challenges but I do mind tedium
GearsOfWar,f5473o4,t1_f546xf9,1571972928.0,Not trying to be a dick but why waste time on a game you don’t enjoy. That’s not fair to yourself. Go find your joy man
GearsOfWar,f546yhd,t3_dmqn4t,1571972814.0,People have done this on many games since the beginning. People are weird af and do weird shit for no reason all the time. I stopped asking why lol
GearsOfWar,f546lus,t3_dmr959,1571972546.0,But it was worth taking time in your finite life to come on here and explain this. Isn’t this still wasting time on gears ?
GearsOfWar,f4widlu,t3_dlu8nw,1571856393.0,It’s cool but why in the hell does it say gears 5 on the side. That really bothers me for some reason
GearsOfWar,f4vsyf2,t1_f4voame,1571847348.0,All praise Odin!
GearsOfWar,f4vsr70,t1_f4vk3db,1571847265.0,Yup exactly!!! That $4 turns into 8 then 12 and 60 and 100. This is what “nickel and diming” means. Just because “it’s only $4” doesn’t make it right. If you buy these then next game it will be worse. They will always keeping raising prices until we all stop buying. Why don’t people look forward and learn from the past. They will do anything we allow them to. Stop letting them fuck you over
GearsOfWar,f4vlv18,t1_f4vkng9,1571844424.0,If they did that then people would complain bc they just grinded out a skin and somebody else just bought it. No matter what people will complain. You can’t make everyone happy it’s impossible. That’s just a rule of life.
GearsOfWar,f4vlfnh,t1_f4vit3f,1571844255.0,Yup exactly. That’s just a rule of life with everything.
GearsOfWar,f4vlbtv,t3_dm07fh,1571844213.0,Nothing will make everyone happy. That’s a rule of life.
GearsOfWar,f4u47x5,t3_dlmj7n,1571798704.0,"Not bashing you personally but wow these posts gotta stop. TC is aware. They are either fixing it or they never will, but the repetitiveness of this sub is unmatched."

GearsOfWar,f4rvy4q,t1_f4rd990,1571772122.0,"Oh of course. All of this is second to the actual system being fixed (if that ever will happen) 
Maybe if the team surrenders the game calculates the rank points at that moment and you get whatever you had at that moment. And then does that count as a loss or a stalemate or even just a no contest ?"
GearsOfWar,f4r94ns,t1_f4r86jb,1571764514.0,Thank you! We def need a little less complaining about issues that TC already acknowledged and said they were working on. It’s almost exclusively negativity nowadays and that kinda sucks tbh
GearsOfWar,f4r8t7f,t3_dlk42l,1571764387.0,The memes were the only good thing left tho. Now it will only be posts complaining about the ranking system. Now there will literally be no fun things or positivity.
GearsOfWar,f4r8dx8,t1_f4r6232,1571764223.0,Exactly. The remaining players should have the option to surrender without being penalized. I end up just burning time til the end of the game a lot of times bc my team left. Maybe the ranking that game just gets voided ?? I’m not sure how that could work bc that would suck too.
GearsOfWar,f4nv0ey,t1_f4nieod,1571693401.0,"For real, are they just monkeys on type writers ?"

GearsOfWar,f4nejq6,t1_f4ne16c,1571688639.0,Exactly. They are already in the game and finished. Just toss them in. At this point they need a good PR move like that

GearsOfWar,f4n6zom,t1_f4n480p,1571686386.0,Yeah I dunno I personally don’t like it. Not bashing it at all just not my thing. I’m happy they are adding themed stuff tho so I’m really not complaining

GearsOfWar,f4mj29e,t3_dkrmvh,1571678957.0,I mean you could just play slower and wait for opportunities and don’t take risks but nobody really cares about your KD. Just play for the team and wins its way more fun in the end
GearsOfWar,f4min7r,t3_dkrwq6,1571678815.0,Stay safe and thank you my dude 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
GearsOfWar,f4mhnrw,t1_f4lwi3h,1571678479.0,"Yup that’s the consequence of free to play or subscription services. People can get access for little to no cost so this is the only way they can survive. People love when it’s free but I’ll tell you this..in life there are no free meals, you’ll pay in one way or another.  The day they announced it was going to be on gamepass I knew it would be this way. The prob is they sell it for $60 bucks too so they are in this no mans land where they kinda fucked everyone"

GearsOfWar,f4hr7ny,t3_dkdhyw,1571595133.0,Yup that’s advertisements for ya. Product placement for gears was a terrible decision. To me it really shows how badly TC is struggling financially. Bowing down to advertisers and all the MTXs really paint a bleak future for tc.
GearsOfWar,f4hm964,t3_dkdvmt,1571593226.0,I get that. Hey maybe gears isn’t your thing. Why do something that makes you angry when other games don’t. Go enjoy your time and not waste it on a game that isn’t enjoyable to you. Find the things in life that bring you joy not anger.
GearsOfWar,f4hdr6e,t3_dkm3md,1571590535.0,This is a good one. Take your upvote and have a nice day sir

FemaleDatingStrategy,f496m0d,t3_djn4ln,1571458049.0,Just because you’ve had terrible experiences in the past doesn’t mean you should shut down all your opportunities for a happier future. Don’t live afraid and running from the past or worst case scenarios. I use to do that and that only brought me more pain and suffering in the end.
GearsOfWar,f45arpk,t3_djhrgh,1571370615.0,Mics exist
GearsOfWar,f45ap8p,t3_djht2w,1571370555.0,I agree. Yes the game has many many many issues but to see the community devolve into a hate mob full of people hating just taking out their life’s frustrations out on TC is sad. The game is nowhere near what this sub has made it out to be. People like to ignore what what other gears game were at launch. They remember gears 4 at year 3 not at launch.
GearsOfWar,f453031,t1_f44vp6i,1571364822.0,Yeah just play for the sake of playin. If you’re still focusing on rank at this point you’re making a mistake
GearsOfWar,f405mao,t3_dj0tbs,1571285850.0,"This is exactly why caring what others think and comparing yourself is very unhealthy. Worrying about what others think only makes you feel less satisfied. Play for yourself. If you want warden, then grind it out and feel accomplished for yourself when you get it. 
I can assure you that even if people knew you earned it the hard way still nobody would give a fuck. So just go unlock what you want regardless of who else does too"
GearsOfWar,f405733,t1_f404n0n,1571285443.0,They’ve collectively decided that they will take out all their hate and dissatisfaction with their life out on TC and gears 5. This sub is just a hate echo chamber. Same posts over and over

GearsOfWar,f3mzwqx,t1_f3mz41t,1570993678.0,I agree with this 100% a forfeit feature would help a lot. Don’t make us suffer and and get smashed bc your team left. Give us an option at least

Maybe some chaos over there bc how could any studio not realize that these things not piss off the whole community ?? There has to be something we don’t know that’s going on with TC. Otherwise I’m giving up on them. I wish they’d just be more open with us and tell us what the fuck is going on. Not just “we’re looking into it” bullshit PR responses.

This world is obsessed with being angry and outraged to the point where people with willfully just focus on minor faults ruin it for themselves. 

Just remember the rule of 10 
3 people will love it, 3 people will hate it 
And 4 people will never give a fuck."
