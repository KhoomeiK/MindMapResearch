Keep up cleaning as normal, throw in a sea salt soak every day or every other day, and leave it alone. It should go away on its own. 

Some optional stuff you could do? 
Well, if you happen to have some chamomile tea (straight up chamomile, nothing else in it) you can steep the bag and then hold it on the bump for about five minutes. Or, you can go for an aspirin paste. 

Good luck!"

PiercingAdvice,fmxhmmu,t1_fmv5r8r,1586465155.0,"Since it's you're first piercing I know it probably seems intimidating to change it yourself, but it's honestly not as hard as it may seem. If you're going to try, I would recommend doing it directly after either a hot shower, or a warm saline soak so that the piercing (like the actual hole lol) is a bit more expanded. Also, wear some latex gloves. Not only for sanitation reasons, but also because it makes it waaaaaaay easier to grip onto small jewelry like that. And remember, youtube is your friend!! I bet you can find videos of people showing you how to change it.   


Also, if you're just absolutely uncomfortable with changing it yourself (which is fine!), don't be afraid to google around for a GOOD piercer in your area. Anybody will allow you to walk into their shop to help you change your jewelry, it DOES NOT have to be the same person who did it initially. Although I don't know if where you are is under quarantine, so that might make this not much of an option right now. But if you go, at most they'll probably charge you for the new jewelry."
PiercingAdvice,fmv5cm2,t3_fxknt0,1586406502.0,"White puss typically isnâ€™t worrisome. Your cleaning regime seems good, and you only really need to worry if the color starts to turn a dark yellow, or green. Or if the swelling gets really insane, as in getting ready to consume the jewelry insane. 

But is that seriously a horseshoe? You NEED to change to a straight bar. Like, yesterday. Iâ€™m amazed that a piercer would recommend that as the jewelry for your cartilage to heal in. Wild. Having a straight bar will really help with keeping the irritation down. If youâ€™re afraid of swelling, then you just get a long ass bar."

bjj,fgdacmy,t1_fgcq1d1,1580680439.0,"Our teacher generally takes a step back once we transition into rolling at the end of class. He really only hands out advice when someone is *just* on the verge of accomplishing something and they need that extra, little step. I assume he hasn't stepped in because he's giving us a chance to figure out our own solutions. Or, it's totally possible he just hasn't even noticed this pinning thing happening since theres alot going on during rolls. 

Also, I'm not terribly offended that this guy is doing this; I know that he's just trying to figure out what to do in this new situation, and he probably doesn't know that it's a little odd.  I'm really just getting frustrated with myself for not finding an approach to deal with it. 

But, I feel like I've received some great feedback on this post, and I totally have some new things to try out next time this happens. If I still can't change position or help myself, then I'll definitely ask my teacher for some input/advice on what to do."

Despite  how frustrating it can be, I *do* appreciate when someone does something odd, or not ""rule conforming,"" since it gives me better preparation for real world self defense.

I totally support BOTW, but if youâ€™re worried about the open world being a little overwhelming for them, maybe consider Links Awakening. Nostalgia for you, cute and easy for them.
