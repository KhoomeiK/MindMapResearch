>Don’t get me wrong, weed and CBD have a ton of benefits. I do really enjoy CBD, and with a little THC mixed in is quite pleasant for me. However, I won’t sit here and pretend that all the weed I smoked from the age of 15 has done anything other than fuck my brain and made all my mental disorders much worse. And the shit is very addictive, sure you won’t be hospitalized from withdrawal, but smoke weed everyday for a year and then tell me how easy it is to go cold turkey and try to live your everyday life.  
>  
>But as someone who’s suffered from addiction to weed, alcohol and plenty of hard drugs, it’s all the same shit to me at this point in my life. I still enjoy smoking weed on the weekends and I enjoy CBD even more. But I’m well aware that weed makes my depression drastically worse, and that it’ll induce a panic attack that I wouldn’t normally have. It’s to be treated as a drug even if you can’t OD like heroin, just because “it’s my medicine bro” is no excuse to be stoned all day everyday.

Yep, that's the kind of content we need, about every drug, even the ones prescribed by doctors. Everything has side effects and we're just trying to make a decision of whether they're worth it. If I was considering it (I'm allergic, unfortunately), that's what I would want to read.

>I wish I understood more why weed culture has gotten so annoying though. The most frustrating one to me though is that when I make claims of weed magnifying my depression and anxiety I get the same spiel. “Bro just try indica, sativa is more mental it just doesn’t agree with you”. And while I certainly agree that indica and sativa are vastly different, weed is weed, and if I take too many puffs it will make me incredibly uncomfortable.

This is the ""you're doing it wrong"" argument. See, if it's not working for you, you must be doing it wrong. Sometimes I see a commenter saying ""maybe this is not for you, try something else instead"" or ""just smoke less"" and I wish I could upvote them 10 times.

But a lot of MLM essential oil moms on Facebook are starting to push CBD into their stupid garbage agenda, which doesn’t help the cause.

I'm under the impression CBD oil is an extract, while essential oils are stronger and ""purer"" in nature.

>Long story short I did get tested, paid an absurd amount of money for them to give me a big IQ test, some test pressing a button for my reaction time for 20 minutes, and a couple of those weird personality tests that ask if you think people can read your thoughts or something. When I was testing I raised concerns that it didn't actually cover what made me want to get a proper diagnosis in the first place (not being able to complete or remember tasks, prioritizing, time blindness, losing track of things, etc) they said ""it will answer more than you think"" and we moved on.

Can relate. I had terrible amnesia (I'd forget what I was saying mid-word) and everyone was like ""nope, nothing to do with attention"".

>4-6 weeks later I get a follow-up with a therapist with the results typed out that we go over together. It states that I tested above average for everything IQ, was clean and well groomed and agreeable the whole time, could play the video game well, and tested for anxiety and depression, and therefore they didn't think I had adhd.

That's really it. If Einstein was born with ADHD in this century and got your results, it's likely there wouldn't be a relativity theory since he was above average already. They're gatekeeping you out.

>She asked about my short experience with the vyvanse. I said it really cleared my head and gave me focus and I could get a lot more done. She informed me that this was what people *without* adhd experience, and that people with adhd feel ""normal"" on it. I don't really understand what this means so clarification would be great.

She's lying. It's a stimulant: it makes people feel confident. People with ADHD are still people. That being said, what you felt boils down to confidence. Vyvanse might not be the drug for you. 

>What do I do? Accept the results? Contest the results with the center, which terrifies me for some reason? Am I justified in looking for a second opinion? Will the testing just be the same if I do? I don't want to see another psychiatrist if I can, I've had him for years and he's been so great. I don't know if he'll listen to this though. I feel so stuck.

This is where it gets tricky. You need to get appropriate healthcare. Pushing down the center would be perfect if it worked, since everyone would end up happy. 

But, if it doesn't, you should talk to your doctor and share your concerns about your own health and that test. Hope it works. If it doesn't, you'll have to weigh in how much you think you need it. Depression and anxiety are disorders that any doctor will be glad to treat you. ADHD isn't.

I wouldn't say quick, but it's being sold as an universal, everyone-should-do-it fix. 

>Here is a bit of an analogy that you can sort of bring over to mindfulness. I struggled a LOT with social anxiety when I was younger to a degree where it was very distressing. I really wanted to fix it as soon as possible and tried to suppress and fight my discomfort with all means I could think of. If a therapist had suggested that I'd try to accept that I was feeling anxious and uncomfortable and be ok with that I'd been very disappointed and frustrated - I wanted to be RID of the anxiety, not accept it. However, the key to getting rid of social anxiety is just that - to accept that you have no control over the situation, and that it is fine to feel anxious. The key to being socially confident is being fine with the worst outcome - that nobody likes you and you feel bad because of it. Which, if you think about it, is not that terrible actually. The better I got at accepting that I sometimes felt anxious in social situations, the more I learned that it was ok and that I didn't have to have perfect social interactions, socializing became a lot easier, I got a lot better at it, and I started feeling much less anxious. So it's not a quick fix, but a long term shift in how you relate to life which in the end works much better. Does this make sense?

HOCD,ewh7cez,t3_co5a0w,1565399859.0,"There's an exercise that has helped me in many occasions, it takes a few weeks to work but, when it works, it quenches the obsession for good. I don't talk about it here since most are not really obsessed about being gay, but mostly about being what they hate, and this exercise only works on emotions derived from fear (anxiety, despair, shame, terror, etc). 

You can do it by yourself or with the assistance of a therapist (any will do, although a cognitive-behaviorist would be best). Make sure you're on an environment you can't be heard or interrupted by anybody else.

Write down on a piece of paper what you are afraid to accept. It doesn't have to be true or even likely. It could be delusional, even. Just write it down.

Then, look at a mirror (phone camera or screen turned off will do) and repeat it to your image. Do it again. It's okay if you fail as long as you keep trying again. Try saying it loud. Do it over and over and over until you get interrupted (I suggest using a 5-minute timer at first, then increase little by little). 

It's ok to let any emotion you feel run loose as long as you keep repeating it. Once you finish, throw the piece of paper away. Try doing it again on the next day, and then on the next, until this fear becomes **boring**. Your mind will avoid obsessing about it cause you killed the reward. 

I learned this from my therapist, it's a real anxiety-killer. You can read more in the book ""The Worry Cure"" by Robert Leahy. It's a good book if you have other anxieties to deal with."

Almost. This is how long a hypomanic episode should at least last, yes, but, to be BP2, a patient only requires having one of those in a lifespan. 

Other periods of hypomania can last shorter, they're still BP2 in action but won't affect BP2 diagnosis. In this case, the likelihood is really high. A psychiatrist could decide right at the first appointment."

OF COURSE there would be no statistical difference, it doesn't work for people not currently in pain!

There isn't a major ADHD meds abuse going on. This was made up by people who are afraid of having to put in the effort to compete with patients previously crippled by their mental illness. That's why medication is a bigger concern for them than domestic violence against hyperactive kids."

So, weigh pros and cons and see if it's really worth it, or even if it's really going to get you what you want. Managing it without meds ends up in having to take even more meds for some.

Also, you don't have to take meds just because they were prescribed to you. This is nice since you can ask as many questions as you want to your doctor before deciding."
