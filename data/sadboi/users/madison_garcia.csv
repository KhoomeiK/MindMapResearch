depression,f0uvris,t3_d6mlx2,1568952440.0,"right now it‚Äôs because of the stigma. so many people don‚Äôt understand what it‚Äôs like to feel like you (and i) do. i hope one day it can be accepted. my treatments have failed, so to speak. when consistent meds and therapy show little to no improvement it‚Äôs time to discuss ‚Äúother options‚Äù just the same as a patient w terminal cancer and failed treatments. 
i really believe we deserve to die peacefully with dignity and support"
depression,f0qi3c6,t3_d66c43,1568860230.0,"honestly this interests me a lot, i've tried researching into it but there's nothing i can find.  for more physical conditions, the doctor usually has to determine that the life expectancy is not  more than 6 months, depending on the state.  but yea, i think it's worth considering, having the right to assisted suicide in cases of depression.

Enneagram,f0n4n27,t1_f0n3y8a,1568760420.0,"if i wasn't emotionally exhausted all the time, it would be so much easier to put in that effort. i'm drained from feeling anxious and let down about everything, so i don't have the emotional energy to be hopeful and try to better what i can...leading to more disappointment. a vicious cycle."
Enneagram,f0n3dli,t1_f0n34gb,1568759477.0,"no, a definite One. all of my anxiety is from trying to fix everything, internally and externally.  a below average, but solid One"
