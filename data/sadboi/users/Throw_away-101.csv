You are right in saying that these moments made you though, regardless of whether we like it or not, they're what shape our skin and perspective and what compliments the views we have on certain situations today."

I can't remember whether I tried that 64 with another phone though. I'll try the 256gb with another device, but I dunno if I have the time nor the willpower to get to plus 30gbs again since I already know what will happen really.

The phone - Presumably - has corrupted the 256gbs so even by themselves in an adapter, they are screwing up without the phone connected at all, since it's being used via an adapter. So even without the phone they're screwing up but I have a feeling the phone might be responsible for that as my reasons stated in my message."

The Internet adds more flame to the fire sure, but he was majority loved back then, now not so much and I think that's a product of how he vents on people not liking him anymore on his albums rather than taking approaches like he used to."
