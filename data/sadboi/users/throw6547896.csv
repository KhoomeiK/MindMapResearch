NarcissisticAbuse,folizow,t1_folbc8l,1587863257.0,"""Quite often the narcissist uses therapy to better understand human emotion and how to manipulate his victims. In essence, therapy allows them to become better narcissists.""

This is not true. Most narcs (not all) have very poor insight and their ability to self reflect is limited or non-existent. They would spend therapy sessions blaming other people for their problems, not picking the therapist's brain to learn how to better manipulate people. 

Secondly, they would have to be aware that they were narcs in the first place. Sociopaths and psychopaths use therapy to better understand human behavior and emotions, and use it to their advantage. For a narc to do this would imply calculation, and narcs (most) are most often oblivious to the pain they cause. Further, they would not need to utilize therapy sessions to better understand human emotions as they have had their entire lives to gain understanding. 

Your statement seems to intimate that narcissists dont have emotions. Contrary to popular belief, narcs do feel plenty of emotions (generally, negative ones). They are not psychopaths and they do have a conscience. 

Recovery from NPD is possible, and the timeline for that would be based on several different factors namely: self awareness of the particular narc, the level of narcissism, the intelligence of the narc, their willingness to change and work hard, in addition to having a qualified therapist. I know this to be true not only based on the research, but because I have seen it with my own eyes.

 While there are certain traits universal to all narcissists, they are individuals and as such, do possess different qualities. I think it's only fair to keep that in mind. Furthermore, and perhaps even more importantly, labeling somebody a narcissist absent a professional diagnosis is reckless and unjust, as their behavior could stem from a different condition entirely. Just because someone's ex was an abuser, does not automatically mean they suffer from NPD."

NarcissisticAbuse,foj8ybd,t3_g7cytg,1587813065.0,"No offense, but this is the most ridiculous post I have ever seen. A self aware narc CAN change, with longterm intensive therapy! My cousin had NPD and went through seven years of intensive therapy and he doesnt even fit the criteria anymore. While it is not ""curable"" per se, it absolutely can be treated and if one is willing to put in alot of work, change is possible. Simply loving him and him trying by himself are not going to change decades of ingrained defense mechanisms and layers of trauma. So of course he failed. Why you didn't lead him to therapy in his moment(s) of clarity is beyond me. Please refrain from spreading misinformation. It only serves to muddy the waters and may discourage those who really want help from getting it."
