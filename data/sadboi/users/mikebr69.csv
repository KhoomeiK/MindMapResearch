SuicideWatch,fis85zg,t3_f9kcsy,1582679853.0,Life inside your head can get better. I know it's hard now but it is possible to recover from these feelings. It is most likely an imabalance in brain chemistry which we call depression. There are ways to get through depression and life on the other side is rewarding and less painful. Please try to stay. Don't hurt those around you. Talk to someone. Get some professional help. There are many ways to get through this without ending your life

SuicideWatch,fis4q15,t1_firz255,1582677734.0,"There are ways you can tell her that will make it easier to discuss. Firstly, tell her you need to sit down and talk about something serious. This will prepare her to listen and give you the time required without distraction. You don't have to tell her your full intentions if you don't want to or can't handle or feel this would be too much for your mum. Tell her you are really struggling with life and cannot find anything positive to relate to. Tell her you have been feeling this way for a long time and it's not getting better. Hopefully this will open up both of you to talk things through. Seeing a health care professional (GP, psychologist, counsellor) will help you and provide a path to recovering from this but I really don't think anyone will commit you to a mental hospital. First steps will be discussion, maybe medication. Please talk to someone as it will really help you. It sounds like you can trust your mum and she will have your best interests at heart."

Don't judge yourself so hard on your current situation. Life throws in challenges to help us grow. Giving up defeats everything you have learnt so far. I don't have much I can say for you but with some help you can get through this. It is a normal thing to shut down ppl when you're feeling vulnerable.

Your brain has decided that now is the time but it doesn't have to be. You can take control of your brain and choose to live. I hope you are still with us."
SuicideWatch,fimcrbc,t3_f8ll1j,1582525256.0,"I have been there. I lost my 13 year old girl to suicide and I wanted to join her. It seemed the easy way out of my pain. But in reality it would just cause more hurt and pain to others so I am not feeling this way currently. You dont have to set that decision in stone. You are still young and have a life ahead of you. It is possible to change your thinking and feel more positive again. It takes time and a lot of good care but it is achievable. 

Dont depend on the weed too much. It can alter your thinking and leave you feeling quite negative when your not on it. Is there any other medication that will help with your anxiety or condition, talk to your GP. 

1) Can you talk to your parents. Tell them you are struggling with your condition, and the lack of school and social contact that this brings. Tell them it is seriously impacting your mental well being and that you feel hopeless about life. To make sure they have the time to talk to you and take you seriously, make an appointment with them (life can get in the way sometimes and it might seem parents dont care, normally they have external stresses such as bills, jobs, relationships, etc)  say, I really need to talk to you about something important, can we sit down for 10 mins. Then they will give their full attention when they can. Otherwise you might not feel heard when you bring this up.

You have been strong enough to open it up here so if possible find an adult you can trust and open up to them as well. If you are feeling shit about this and yourself now it will not last forever. There is opportunity out there and I would feel sure that the school system somewhere could accommodate you re-sitting another year. I am not sure why this is not possible but press hard for this. It is due to medical reasons and you have every right to complete your education.

&#x200B;

best wishes, be kind to yourself and never blame yourself for this situation. You need as much support as you can get so find someone close you cant trust, or if you dont feel able to do that then maybe go independently to your GP and talk a few things through."
SuicideWatch,fimbh17,t3_f8m2gy,1582523978.0,"Friends come and go, they are sometimes too busy or self indulgent or just getting on with their own lives to notice others around them. This is not unusual and does not reflect on your popularity, likeability or quality of friendships. You are not responsible for what others think of you, and also, you cannot do anything about it anyway. If someone likes you or has time for you it comes from them. If they do not it is not a shortcoming from you, they are missing out on everything that you have to offer. 

I am sorry you attempted and that you are in this space but your friends are probably scared or overwhelmed or just dont know how to respond or help you. The best thing they can do is talk to you or their parents. The best thing you can do is try to open up to Mum or Dad. Please try and be strong and tell them you are not happy at the moment, that you feel there is no point in carrying on. To say you have attempted is a massive step and you have been very brave to open up here, it will take a lot more to tell a loved one but this will really help you deal with your feelings.

It is perfectly normal to feel lost sometimes, no one will judge you for opening this up and if you can tell an adult they will be much better equipped to deal with how you are feeling. With no disrespect but kids do not have the maturity to be able to handle the depth of your struggles.

You say you dont have anyone there for you, how is your family life, can you please talk to a loving parent, or teacher or any adult you have ever felt support from and they will be able to help you work this through. There is nothing to be ashamed about in sharing how you feel, in fact it shows great maturity and strength to your personality.

4 months ago I lost my 13 year old girl to suicide.  I experience loss and pain and grief every single day. No parent deserves to lose a child. All the love and energy and care that we give. It might not feel that way but a parent would stop at nothing to protect their child from harm and self harm is one of the hardest to see or understand as it is generally kept secret until it is too late. Please do not leave it too late or until after. Tell them now how you are doing. I dont know your family dynamics but ask any adult that you trust if you can have 10 minutes of their time as you need to tell them something important. This could be the biggest thing you have ever done but please talk to an adult before you take your thoughts any further."
SuicideWatch,fim9zce,t3_f8m2p2,1582522603.0,"Sorry you are feeling like this. There are people you love and whatever you think you have done they still love you. Hurt is a normal part of relationships and I dont think you should be pinning all the blame on yourself. What I am trying to say (as nicely as possible) is that your conclusions above are rooted in your own thinking, and it is highly likely that the others you refer to do not feel that you have caused them pain, or if you did in the past then they have moved on and forgiven you. Do not dwell on past mistakes. No one is perfect here, everyone makes mistakes. The beauty of human kindness is that we forgive, and continue to love those who have hurt us. I feel sure they will not be thinking that you are the root of their unhappiness so can you open your thinking to another perspective.

You are here, you are valid, you are important, your life matters to many people but not yourself it seems (at the moment anyway).

I think you can move beyond past mistakes, accept your friends for who they are and let them accept you. In my experience most people dont judge or hold onto judgements forever, we can bend and grow past these matters.

You are right in that your death would cause a lot of people a hell of lot of pain and it really is not worth ending your life to inflict that on everyone. It is not a solution to your problems and only brings more pain to others.

Please be strong, accept yourself. If you feel so shit about yourself then try to do some good to other people and see how that feels. Talk to a homeless person and find out how they are going. If you see anyone struggling ask them if they need help. The more you reach out to others the more you will restore your sense of self worth and goodness will flow back into your life.

If you dwell on negativity then your whole being will reflect that. I know it is a flippant thing to say but try and be positive about yourself and your life."
SuicideWatch,fim8jo8,t1_fim5hw2,1582521337.0,"I dont feel attacked at all, dont worry. I dont know your situation, just trying to offer some support and help and I do believe you can get through this. You seem very smart and have managed to rationalise your thoughts to be normal and a solution for you. I think this is a reaction to cortizol which is the long term stress hormone. It tends to focus the brain on finding a solution to your current stressor. So after adrenalin has worn off (fight or flight reaction to stress) then cortizol takes over and fixes your brain on the solution. This narrows your thinking and makes it hard to think about anything else but how to end your problem. Your brain has determined that the only way out of this cycle of pain is to end your life. This is a normal reaction to brain chemistry imbalance but it can be restored. There is hope for you and it would be such a waste to end it all when you are so young. You have everything to look forward to and I hope you find supportive relationships with people who you can trust enough to talk about these things. 

Life can be tough but it is also rewarding. I hope you can find some happiness in your life and someone who can relate to you to help you through this."
SuicideWatch,fim700d,t1_fim3kic,1582519984.0,Thank you. It has been a living nightmare. Please reconsider your plans and talk to someone before you go through with this. I assure you it can be turned around. However bad you feel now there is hope that it can get better and opening up to someone in real life is the first step to healing.
SuicideWatch,fim6shn,t3_f8j5uy,1582519805.0,"Please dont. The loss and pain it will bring to others is unbearable. I lost my 13 yr old girl to suicide. She had similar feelings to yourself but I only found out afterwards. There is hope. It is not your fault, it is more likely a clinical condition like depression. Do you get out and get any sunshine? We all need 10 mins per day sun exposure to arms and face to maintain our vitamin d levels. If Vit D is low then it can lead to depression. I would recommend you get some sunshine every day or supplement your vitamin d intake. A simple thing like that could help you feel better within about a month. Please try this and give yourself some more time. Friends are important and I'm sure your friends would be devastated to realise you are in this state. Please talk to anyone.

It is very hard to describe our inner feelings but it is not a burden to others. If you can open up to someone close they will be supportive and grateful that you have told them how    
 you feel. 

Talk to a health care professional.

Set some positive goals you can achieve. How about asking Mum or Dad if there is anything more you can do to help them. Talk to them if you can. Tell them you are feeling seriously down about yourself and you dont want to carry on feeling like this. Tell them you are considering ending your life as you cannot see any way forward.

When you are depressed your brain chemistry is messed up. We have the main stress hormone adrenalin which governs fight or flight, this is to get you away from danger, however that is perceived. The next hormone is cortizol which narrows your thinking to finding a solution to  your problems. Your brain has been unable to cope with these stress chemicals so has decided that the only way out is to end this state. That is a normal clinical reaction to brain chemistry imbalance (depression) and it can be reset with good self care, positive relationships, counselling, therapy, or anti depressants. It is very hard to see anything positive and very hard to move out of that state when you are stuck in it because your brain chemistry is telling you something is drastically wrong and it needs a solution. When you can open up and tell someone then you can start to heal and understand your condition from another perspective. 

Please do not do anything drastic or final without considering there are ways to get you through this. You are not worthless, or a bad person, or a bad friend, it is your perception of those things that is wrong and I strongly believe you can change those perceptions over time and with good guidance. 

The pain from the loss of my daughter has been unbearable which is why I have come here. I hope that I can reach out and give you something hopeful to cling to. You are young and your life is full of hope and opportunity. You have your whole life ahead of you and life can be great. Yes it can be painful and yes depression is a real thing that can make you feel shit about life, yourself and others but it is a temporary state and can be changed. Please do not throw away your life for a transient thing that will get better over time.

I feel sure that your parents will open their arms with love and compassion for you. It will be hard for you to start but I would ask you to be brave and try to open up to them and tell them how you are feeling."
SuicideWatch,fim3odf,t3_f8jmsi,1582517284.0,"Hoping to talk to you before you go any further. Depression is a bastard but it can get better. There is hope out there.

SuicideWatch,fim2mpe,t3_f894se,1582516489.0,"I am so glad she has called this off. Thank you for your support.

Please encourage your friend to talk to her parents. They need to understand the depth and gravity of her feelings.

SuicideWatch,fim190t,t3_f8kclk,1582515463.0,"My 13 year old girl killed herself 4 months ago. I have felt the depths that you are in now but I'm asking you, as a parent, please consider how your mum or dad would feel if you go through with this. Please dont go through with this, you will condemn them to a life of Why, How, What did I do wrong, Why did he not talk to me, Why didnt I listen and endless pain and grief and depression. I dont know how you came to this point but I hope you can stop your countdown now and re-think this."
SuicideWatch,fim0g13,t3_f8a5px,1582514861.0,"Get out and get some sunshine. Seriously, you have a lot of shit going on in your life and you staying indoors all the time will mean you are deficient in Vitamin D. You need 10 mins of sun exposure per day on your arms and face to maintain vitamin D. Lack of Vit D is a major contributor to depression and sorry for this assumption but if your are feeling lost and suicidal then you are depressed. If you cant get enough sunshine then supplement Vit D and see how you feel in a months time.

 If I was interviewing a candidate and one was down on themselves and the other was positive I would consider the positive person first. If you are coming over as lacking in self confidence or negative then you are not presenting the best you. It will take time but I believe you can turn this around. You are not worthless at all. You are in the top 5%, or higher. You have every opportunity in front of you and you are still young. Success at an interview is not luck, or chance, all decisions are based on what is presented at the time by the available candidates. If you are down or struggling with life at the moment then subtle signs will make you a less attractive candidate. I would recommend you take any work at the moment. It will give you experience in industry, reward you for your time, expose you to training and other opportunities, and give you a new circle of potential friends and contacts to help you on your journey as well as showing your parents that you can achieve and obviously putting money back into your back which will relieve a good chunk of your stress.  
You might have to consider moving to where work is if your bank balance can support this.

Even though you feel your parents are not supportive they would be devastated by your loss. No parent ever deserves to lose a child. If you can find the courage, sit down with them and tell them how you feel about life. It will be hard, painful, there will be tears but you will be so lifted by being able to share how you feel. We only have words to describe our inner thoughts. No one can read your mind and your parents will not be aware of how you are dealing with your current situation. It is really important that you tell someone before acting out on intentions to end your life.

Life is hard, it is painful at times but it is also rewarding and you have everything in front of you. Please dont throw it away.

Take up a hobby, read a book, do a puzzle, play a game, do anything to take your mind off your current thoughts. Talk to anyone. Do a good deed for someone. If you see anyone struggling, go up to them and ask if they need a hand. Ask your Mum or Dad if there is anything you can do at home to help them out. Do chores and keep your space tidy so you are less picked on. Your contributions will be noticed and appreciated and this change will probably lift your mood as well.

Friends are important too. Try and branch out and find more friends who are local to you. If you have anyone you can talk to please take the step and call them and tell them how you are at the moment. I believe you need a lot of support in turning this around. It is possible by yourself but it is much easier if someone else can guide you. 

Your life is important. Feel the earth between your toes, go barefoot on the grass and imagine the earth spinning endlessly beneath you. You matter here and your life has huge importance and potential, keep a hold of it, grow it, nurture it, build yourself with positive connections and thoughts.

Example, every day when you wake up be thankful for 5 things, show gratitude to life and you will feel better in yourself. You have a roof over your head, food on the table, and you have a highly developed mind bursting with energy and ideas. You matter."
SuicideWatch,filxmu1,t3_f8g4rb,1582512829.0,"I dont know what to say. It will all sound crass and cliched, but be strong, be kind to yourself. PLEASE talk to someone in real life. Friends, family, or professional support if you have access to that but please tell someone what is going on in your life and why you feel this way.

I lost my 13 year old girl to suicide. It is the most painful thing I have ever endured. If you can talk to your parents please do so. No parent should ever go through the loss of a child. 

Make sure you are getting enough sunlight. You need 10 minutes exposure on your arms and face per day to maintain Vitamin D. If you dont get enough sun you will be deficient and this leads to depression. If you cant get enough sun then supplement your Vitamin D. 

Plant both feet firmly on bare soil or grass. Be aware of your body. Feel yourself and your existence on this planet that is spinning rapidly under your feet. You matter. You have a place here. Your life is important. Who knows what might happen in the future. Your life could turn around and I hope you find some comfort in future.

Take up a hobby, look for social groups of like minded people. Spend more time with positive people. Every day when you wake up find 5 things to thank the universe for.  
eg, the sun is out, its a new day, thank you that I have food on the table and a safe place to live, thanks for friends, relationships. Find anything you can be grateful for and list them to yourself. Try this practice every day, it will help keep you more positive.

Try and do a good deed for someone else. Help an old lady with her shopping, if you see anyone struggling with anything go up to them and ask if they need help. These random acts will help you grow stronger, more confident, more accepted, and you will probably find good things coming back to you 10 times over for everything you do.

Take time for yourself, read a book, do a puzzle, play a game, get some fresh air, go on a bike ride, anything where you are occupied will take your mind off your troubles.

I hope you can find peace and happiness in your life. Your life matters to many many people. Parents, family, friends, teachers, colleagues, everyone would be devastated by your loss so do not consider for one moment that your life does not matter. It does.   


I have so much respect for you coming here and saying what you have said. I am sending peace, happiness and respect to you and I hope you can work through this current situation."
SuicideWatch,filw0aw,t3_f8h8y0,1582511687.0,"Please dont. I am so sorry you feel this way. Your kids need you. They need their mum more than anyone.  
Find some positive things to focus on. Look at your children. They need their Mum in their lives.   
I know relationship break downs really hurt. I have been through divorce with three kids and now I only have 2 kids as I lost one to suicide (which is why I am here...). Life is shit sometimes but time does heal. You must allow yourself time to heal and it is possible. Life does not have to be shit all the time, there is hope out there you just need to find it, grasp onto it and never let it go. I think your hope should be to see your kids grow up, finish school, get married, have kids themselves. Your healing is possible. Do not give up.

Get some sunshine. 10 minutes exposure per day on your arms and face is required to maintain Vitamin D levels. If you are low in vitamin D (winter blues, seasonally adjusted disorder) then you will feel terrible. Make sure you get enough sun or take supplements if you cant get out so much. Look at nature. See the beauty in everything. Enjoy every sunset as it signals a new day is coming. You can get through this. Please be strong.

Go bare feet on the grass and soil. Plant your feet firmly on the ground and feel your place in the universe. You are wanted, needed and have a place. Please dont throw that away. Even if you feel terrible now that can pass with time. Look after yourself, set yourself some goals that you can achieve. Break down tasks into small achievable steps that you can do, then tick them off.

Try a new hobby if you have the time. Sit down and read a book or do a puzzle. Something to take your mind off your current thinking.

If you have friends and family close by please try and tell someone how you feel. Do not bottle it up inside. No one will be burdened by you sharing. They will be honoured and lifted up by offering help and support to you. It is really important to talk about your current feelings. No one can read your mind and words are all we have to describe our inner thoughts. If yours are in termoil then you must talk to someone.

Get professional help if it is available to you.

Relationships, stuff that, you can be fine by yourself. You can be strong. Have more time for yourself and your kids, not have anyone else bothering you, telling you what to do or putting pressure on you, be happy with your own company and spend more time with your children. Your ex partner was not everything to you, you exist separately to that relationship and it does not define who you are. You can, and probably will meet someone else in future and who knows, they could well be a better fit for you and more supportive and more loving and more caring.

I hope you can find some comfort in your troubles. Please dont act out on your current thinking, give it more time and more chance to heal and be strong for your children cos they need you here.

Sending compassion, peace and respect to you. It takes amazing courage to say what you have said. Be kind to yourself and I hope you can keep going, get better, stronger and happier than before."
SuicideWatch,filtalj,t3_f8e8ez,1582509815.0,"You are right. Setting daily goals, planning longer term goals is a great way to stave off unwanted thoughts. Write a list and you can focus on getting your goals ticked off. Find some positive things to do, read a book, spend some time outside, help out at home, learn a new skill or hobby, help someone else with something. Keep them simple and achievable. Like, tomorrow I am going to ask Mum or Dad if I can help them with anything in the house. 

I dont know if this will help but walk barefoot in the grass and soil. Sit down outside and plant both feet firmly on the ground. Imagine the world spinning endlessly underneath your feet. Feel your place in the universe. Find a connection with everyday life.

Get 10 minutes of sun every day. Arms and face exposed for 10 minutes will top up your vitamin D which will help with depression.

Talk to your family. Tell them how you are feeling.

Sorry that you attempted and well done for reaching out here. Hopefully you can find some peace and answers. Good luck :)"

I dont know if this helps but it works for me...go bare feet on the ground and feel the earth. Feel your connection to the world spinning underneath your feet. Sit down, feet planted on the ground and feel yourself in the universe, be aware of your own body and what it feels like to be connected to the earth.  
Make sure you get 10 minutes of sunshine every day. Exposing your arms and face to the sun for 10 mins will top up your vitamin D which helps ward off depression.  
Talk to someone, anyone. If you are missing physical contact then hug a mate.   
Do you have family or friends you can talk to?  Your feelings are deeply set at the moment and have been going on for some time, you have done an awesome thing in opening up here but I would encourage you to talk to someone in real life. If there is anyone you can call on please try to discuss your feelings. You are not a burden on them, they will be lifted that you have opened up to them. We only have words to describe how we feel inside so use your words, tell someone close to you. Tell them the extent of your feelings so they understand where you are at. Sharing this will give you a massive relief as it is probably bottled up at the moment.

I hope you can work this out. Be strong and please tell someone. There is no shame in sharing how you feel and this might just save your life."

SuicideWatch,filp42i,t3_f7t07v,1582506916.0,"Please dont. I think everyone has felt this way sometimes. These feelings should pass with time. It really is not worth ending your life for a temporary and transient feeling that time can heal.

You have made a great step in opening up here, I hope you are getting some comfort to know that people do care, complete strangers on the other side of the world can still have a connection with you. I am sending you compassion, peace and ultimate respect to you for having the courage to discuss this.

Sometimes it is hard to make friends but I really dont think everyone hates you - People dont make those judgements so quickly.

When you are forming a response to someone, or want to talk to someone try and frame it in a positive way, this will come over as more attractive. Ask people what they like, what they do, what music they like, what hobbies they have, find some common interests and make some good friends.  I do hope you can work this out. It could take a long time to turn things around but you have the power to get through this. In my experience most people dont judge, so go easy on yourself.

Living in a family environment can be tough if you feel unwanted. I dont know you or your situation but ask what you can do to help someone in the house, they will be more open to you. Tidy your space, help Mum or Dad (or whoever) out with jobs around the house. This will help you feel more included and get them back on side with you.

If you are finding life tough tell someone, not just on here (this is a great step, well done), but in real life. Tell your family you are finding life difficult. Tell them you dont feel much hope in trying to carry on and make sure they listen. Make sure they understand the depth and gravity of your current feelings - talking is the only thing we have. We can only use words to describe our inner thoughts and feelings, no one can read your mind, you MUST talk this out before you consider finality.

As a really simple thing, make sure you get 10 minutes of sunshine every day. Arms and face exposed for 10 minutes will top up your vitamin D. Lack of vitamin D is a prime cause of depression. This is a simple thing that anyone can do.

Get some exercise. Go out for a walk and look at nature. Find a sport or a hobby you have been into and get back into it. Check online for any support in your area. 

Do not be ashamed to get professional help - you mentioned you were still at school, is there a school counselor - make an appointment. If there is support available to you then take every advantage of that. Therapy can help guide you through this and give you the tools to overcome your current situation.

Help someone else. Positive action towards other people will give you a greater sense of worth. Help the old lady with her shopping, ask if she needs help getting home or across the road. Small acts of kindness can bring massive positive returns. If you see someone who is struggling with anything ask if you can help them.

Get into your studies, if home is difficult spend time in the library. Learn up on what you are studying and you will see improvements in your abilities. This will help you feel more positive about yourself and more accepted in class.

Are you working? - look at getting a part time job. This will give you money, independence, self gain (you will learn how to fit into the workplace, you will learn new skills that you can apply in your own life, you will be rewarded for your work), you might meet some new friends through your colleagues or connections.

Please keep strong and be kind to yourself. Set yourself some small goals that are achievable, write them down and keep looking at them. eg Today I am going to ask (whoever) if I can help them with something. When you have ticked them off the list you will be happier and more rewarded and you will see the benefits of your efforts come back to you. 

Well done for reaching out. I hope you find the support and guidance you are looking for and I hope you can turn around your current thoughts and feelings.

Best wishes..."
