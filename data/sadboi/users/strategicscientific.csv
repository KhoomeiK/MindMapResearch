I needed a couple of dose changes initially, which is pretty common, but no more waking up soaking and terrified.

That said, it doesn’t typically make folks sleepy, but the drop in BP could make it possible. 
What I’ve read, and experienced, is that there are often frequent dose increases needed at the beginning of treatment. So don’t worry if, after a little bit, it isn’t working as well - it’s not the end of the world! You most likely just need a dose increase.  :)"

I’ve also been having other cognitive issues, with both memory and function, so that’s what leads me to say that I think it could be ptsd or ptsd related. Try to go easy on yourself and realize that you’re doing the best that you can; also, these slip-ups that are so obvious to you are most often invisible to the outside world.

For more explanation, my Nex was conveniently “disabled” for over 10 years, while I was the sole breadwinner for the family. During this time, I also took care of the children, house, meals, and the Nex himself. Once the combination of abuses - including, but not by any means limited to financial - became so severe that I was forced to take the action to exclude him from the house, he was suddenly able to work and earn a living, cook, and clean.

What I’ve started doing lately is writing down my accomplishments each day, and I find that it really helps - even if it’s *”just”* showered, ate healthy brain food, went to appointment, made a phone call, [which is a LOT!], it really helps me when I’m thinking about all the things that I *didn’t* get done and I’m feeling like I did nothing all day, I can look at the list and see how untrue that really is!!

ptsd,fg563ub,t3_ewxz0p,1580519203.0,"I can completely understand why you feel that way, and I have been there myself. I will say that prazosin has been incredibly helpful for me, in addition to my usual sleep meds. I’ve needed 2 dose adjustments since starting it, but I’m still so thankful that I’m on it. The nightmares, night terrors, and night sweats have all decreased substantially. I also find that a weighted blanket is really super comforting. Sometimes during the day if I get overwhelmed, I will get under it for a while and it calms me down. I also have been using an app for “white noise” type sounds — my pupper and I really like the “rain on leaves” sound lately, it helps to drown out any random noises that might otherwise make my hyper-vigilance kick into overdrive. Everything else is secondary to the medication, I feel, but can be helpful. Best of luck to you."

I didn’t have anything left, I had just been running on empty for so long, protecting the kids, “taking care” of everyone else but me.

ptsd,ffxpsoy,t3_evrjp3,1580330023.0,"I find that I have memory issues in general, especially short-term memory. I’m also having cognitive issues, so I can understand the “black space” inside your head statement! I have been doing art therapy, as it’s supposed to get the two halves of the brain communicating again, which trauma often stops. I’m also doing as many different types of puzzles as I can, because a veteran friend of mine has said that the VA uses puzzle therapy for ptsd. I’m hoping to see improvement, but I’m with you all that it’s very frustrating!"
NarcAbuseAndDivorce,ffqohqu,t3_eujov5,1580139921.0,"This is so awesome to hear, both because I’m very happy for you that you’ve managed to come through the other side of this awful struggle and realize your worth, and because it’s amazingly similar to what I went through and what I’m still going through. I glossed over so much in the hopes that things would get better and my efforts would be recognized - and instead, all that ever happened was that I was just crapped on and abused even more, as were the kids. But now, I have the pleasure of getting to watch the kids thrive in his absence and it’s stunning. So thank you for your words, they are so helpful as I continue to work on myself in therapy and in my little family unit. It’s really breaking out of the shell."

Divorce,ffok6f2,t1_ffofn0x,1580078450.0,"It’s been quite an experience, that’s for sure.  :) 

I’m glad that the emotional distance has given you some clarity, it will likely continue, I know that it has for me, anyway, and I’m several months ahead of you. I really recommend therapy and doing what you can to define what you want your family to look and function like - because it’s different now - it’s your home, and it’s your chance to make it a place that runs the way you want it to. For me, home is now a calm place where yelling isn’t the go-to, and everyone feels safe. I’m still working on defining some of the pieces, but it’s been nice to see and feel the differences. 
Take care of yourself, too. I’m sure it’s been a long road, and the better you care for yourself, the better you will be able to take care of your kids. It’s the old “put the oxygen mask on yourself FIRST, and THEN you can help those around you with theirs.”  :)"
Divorce,ffnjxfi,t1_ffni06a,1580066949.0,"Trust me, I did, too. That’s why I stuck it out as long as I did - 17 years of marriage - and only ended up calling it quits when the kids became targets, too. Well that, and a couple of incidences of mania or maybe psychosis that resulted in his involuntary commitmentS, plural. When I was looking out for the kids safety afterwards, and that was not respected, I knew that we were living on two different worlds, and I no longer had any interest in sharing a life with him. 
As for doubting your sanity, that’s a classic thing for narcissists to do, it’s called gaslighting. I lived that life for too long. There are a lot of presentations, videos, and just plain old info about gaslighting out there, take a look, it’s a trip."
ptsd,ffnhgbo,t3_euackn,1580066033.0,"I will second the weighted blanket! I will also say that I totally understand [I think] what you’re saying - I’m going to therapy, taking my meds, doing, by all accounts, everything that I’m supposed to be doing, but progress is so frustratingly slow! I’ve been told that it takes time, and it’s all perfectly normal, but when it’s your life, it’s not so easy to wait! So I get that! Best of luck to you, and know that you are not alone!"
ptsd,ffn74bi,t3_eu4zi2,1580062671.0,"I’m on prazosin, which a few others have mentioned, and it’s made a huge difference for me. That and a weighted blanket! Prazosin was originally a blood pressure medication [minipress, it was called], but it’s been used for PTSD-associated nightmares/terrors, and night-sweats for quite a while now. I did read that you would likely need to have somewhat frequent dose adjustments in the beginning as your body got used to the medication, and that’s what happened in my case. It’s been such a game changer though!! Good luck!"
Divorce,ffmqail,t3_eu85q3,1580057860.0,"Honestly, I think you’re still being too hard on yourself. Speaking as someone who is  separated from a bipolar, NPD, BPD-tendency [B&W thinking, no emotional regulation, etc.] displaying spouse, no one is capable of being a “good enough spouse” in their eyes. Because they are incapable of accepting any responsibility for their actions, and they resent your protective boundaries. I spent so many years hoping, and helping him try to change, and all that happened was that I was resented, manipulated, abused,  and driven beyond the point of exhaustion.  
I’m glad that you’re at the point where you realize that you don’t miss her. I think giving yourself more time to reflect on how much you have really been doing to keep the peace, and what that has cost you will be enlightening. If I might be so bold, and you haven’t done so already, you should have a look at r/NarcAbuseAndDivorce. I’m not saying that your stbxw is a narcissist, but BPD and NPD often coexist, so it might be worth a visit. Best of luck to you and your kids."

My stbx threatened suicide as a way to manipulate his way back into the house, and I waited to get myself therapy - and I’m paying for it now. This is a huge trauma for you, and you need to put your oxygen mask on before you help anyone else with theirs.

EatCheapAndHealthy,fdnbn8c,t1_fdn8nw1,1578582287.0,"I’m in the US, and I will say that the price of eggs varies ~amazingly~ depending on what you want to spend/eat. The food industry here is so screwed up that the eggs you buy for $0.99/dozen have very little in common with the eggs that you buy for $5.00/dozen, and even less in common with the farm fresh eggs if you’re lucky enough to be able to get them locally. Just a visual comparison of the yolk color and consistency will be enough to convince you of the nutritional differences between them, it’s startling. You really are getting what you pay for, and too few people are aware of that."
