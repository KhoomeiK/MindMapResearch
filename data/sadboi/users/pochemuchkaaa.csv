At least for me it's not really about going shirtless in public; that's just a symptom of the bigger issue, which is that women's breasts are overly sexualized. Yes, breasts are a secondary sex characteristic that people find sexually attractive, but they have other contexts too. For example mothers should be able to breastfeed children in public without people acting like they're doing something dirty. Also, when people are out in public at the beach or the park or whatever, they should be able to handle women going shirtless on hot days, just like men. I understand the temptation to look, but I think over time it would become more normalized and people would be able to separate the feeling they get from seeing a stranger's breasts on the street from the feeling they get seeing their partner's bare breasts during sex.

I didn't wanna tell them that it was because if I got every cut stitched that needed to be stitched, I would be there at least once a week. I'm in recovery now, but I have lots of scars that people stare at if I wear short sleeves. I just want them to go away now. I lucked out that I miraculously didn't cause any serious nerve damage or hit a major vein/artery, but it's not a gamble you should make. Look at an anatomical drawing of the vascular system, or of all the nerves in your body. They're everywhere. It's not worth the risk. Sorry for rambling; I just hope maybe sharing my shitty experience will discourage you a bit from wanting to go deeper. The severity of your self harm has NOTHING to do with the validity of your suffering and/or mental illness. I truly believe that you will recover someday, and, trust me, you'll be grateful you didn't go deeper.
Btw your girlfriend should get stitches if she cuts that deep again. You can't get stitches if the wound is more than 24 hours old, so I'm guessing it's too late for her current ones, but just for future reference, if you have access to that. You should take care of your wounds, too. Just because they don't need stitches doesn't mean they don't need to be sanitized and sometimes bandaged. I wish both of you two luck in your recovery <3"

TwoSentenceHorror,fisg9m0,t1_fis8jvc,1582684277.0,"Although the premise of the story (parent poisoning child) is inspired by Munchausen by Proxy, I thought I would add an extra level of horror by making the parent truly believe they are helping their child when, in actuality, they are slowly killing her. So I suppose the parent's diagnosis would be Delusional Disorder?? I'm in no way a psychology expert; I just wanted to write a scary story. But if anyone wants to chime in with more speculation or share some psychological input, please do! Psychology is super fascinating and I'd love to learn more!
(Also I'm using gender neutral language to refer to the parent because technically gender isn't specified in the story, but you guys are right to assume it's the mother since it is in 95% of cases. I just wanted to keep it gender neutral in case someone wants to interpret it differently.)"

AmItheAsshole,fi71d60,t1_fi6k4cr,1582212222.0,"Yeah, I'm not gonna lie it's pretty fucking disgusting. I just felt bad because this is the first girl who's been interested in him for awhile so I'm sure he was super disappointed that things fell flat. Also, as bad as I feel for him, of course I feel wayyy worse for the girl, and since OP is someone she'll probably have to see around, maybe a text apologizing and explaining about his roommate would make her feel a little less terrified every time she bumped into him lmao"

AmItheAsshole,fi5odl2,t3_f6j8f8,1582167278.0,"NTA but it makes me sad that you feel like your chance with this girl is ruined! I think you should text her to properly explain what happened. There's no harm in giving it one more go, as long as you take no for an answer if no's the answer. Maybe something along the lines of:
""Hey, sorry if the other night was weird. I've tried to get my roommate to get rid of that disgusting board many times but he refuses. I finally took matters into my own hands and got rid of it after I saw how uncomfortable it made you. If you're willing to give me another chance, maybe we could spend some time together somewhere where you feel more comfortable?""

Just an idea :)"

MadeMeSmile,fhyi2jf,t3_f5g2ti,1581976333.0,"Since this is getting a little bit of attention I wanted to share Ollie's story because it might make you smile a second time! He was rescued from literally the middle of the freeway when he was about six weeks old. My mom was in standstill traffic on the freeway and she looked to her left and saw a tiny black kitten pushed up against the concrete median barrier (to this day we don't know how he got there.) Since the cars weren't moving she put her hazards on and got out of the car and caught him with a blanket. We took him to the vet who said his little paws were burnt and he was dehydrated, but otherwise okay. He made a full recovery and he's lived with us very happily for about two and a half years now. He loves to snuggle and play games such as ""Surprise! I was hiding under the bed! Did I scare you?"" as illustrated in the picture :)"

Remember not to beat yourself up if you relapse on your journey to recovery. Unfortunately we all have weak days as well as strong days, but in the long run, I know you'll kick self harm's ass!"
thatHappened,fhkq7wg,t1_fhk39d7,1581689190.0,"If the daughter is a teenager, you're absolutely right. I was picturing her as a kid because usually when parents post stuff like this it's about a younger child because it's supposed to be funny that a little kid said something so relatable to adults. So I guess it could go either way to be honest"
