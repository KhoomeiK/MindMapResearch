The thing is, if your parents are against the reality (or even the thought) of you being gay or bisexual or transgender or anything even remotely associated with the LGBT community, they will probably either not see it or will deny it to themselves.  My ex-husband saw all of the same things I saw in our son but chose to believe that he thought boys were cute because our daughters thought they were cute.  Even when our son went to the homecoming dance with a young man, his dad told himself that they were just going as friends.  If your parents do not agree with your preference, they probably don't even see it.
