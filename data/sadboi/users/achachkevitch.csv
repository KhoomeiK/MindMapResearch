As part of the project, students and incarcerated artists create artworks together that are then featured in an annual zine – a small, non-commercial magazine. So far, the group published two *Incarceratedly Yours*zines.

“Our society has sequestered incarcerated people in a way that makes us scared to interact with them,” said Chang, a senior majoring in psychology. “But the fact is they are humans just like we are.”

The project grew from a connection Stanford lecturer [**Selby Wynn Schwartz**](https://undergrad.stanford.edu/people/selby-wynn-schwartz) made with Emile DeWeaver, who was then an inmate at San Quentin State Prison, during a trip she made to the prison with an artistic ensemble several years ago.

DeWeaver and two other incarcerated men had just established a nonprofit, called [**Prison Renaissance**](https://www.prisonrenaissance.org/), to connect incarcerated people to free communities through arts, media and technology. DeWeaver suggested forming a chapter of Prison Renaissance at Stanford, and Schwartz agreed if DeWeaver could help co-direct it. After DeWeaver and Schwartz launched Stanford’s chapter of Prison Renaissance in 2017, Chang and Wang were among the first students to get involved with it.

When Wang and Chang showed up to the first meeting Schwartz gathered, Wang started brainstorming ideas to promote the art and other creative works the group created while talking on the phone to DeWeaver, who was still inside San Quentin at the time.

“It’s not about the poem or the painting at the end of the day,” said Wang, who is majoring in sociology. “Art is a universal language. It’s a vehicle that helps build deep friendships and connections.”"""

""When last we checked in with Japan’s Hayabusa2 spacecraft in April, it had blown a crater in a large rock that orbits the sun. On Wednesday night (Thursday morning in Japan), the robotic probe went in for a landing, and [appeared to have successfully touched down](https://twitter.com/haya2e_jaxa/status/1149127163456577536) on the asteroid’s surface.

Hayabusa2 was launched in 2014 to collect samples from Ryugu, an asteroid that orbits the sun between Earth and Mars and has a diameter of just over a half mile. By returning to Earth next year with these specimens, the mission will help scientists seek clues about the solar system’s origins.

Earlier in the year, the spacecraft used explosives and a projectile to liberate rock from beneath the asteroid’s outer layers. In the latest operation, it descended to the surface of the asteroid before 9:30 p.m. Eastern time, attempting to swiftly grab a sample of material from the crater it made.  
Pictures posted by the mission’s managers after the landing showed a scattering of rocks as the spacecraft lifted from the asteroid’s surface.  
Following the brief landing, the spacecraft returned to a safe position above Ryugu. It is [scheduled to begin its return to Earth](http://www.hayabusa2.jaxa.jp/en/news/schedule/) with the samples it collected at the end of the year.  
**Why are scientists studying this asteroid?**

Asteroids are bits and pieces leftover from the disc of gas and dust that formed around the young sun and never quite coalesced into a planet. They contain some almost pristine compounds that help tell what the early solar system was like 4.5 billion years ago.

Ryugu, as dark as coal, is a C-type, or carbonaceous, asteroid, meaning it is full of carbon molecules known as organics including possibly amino acids, the building blocks of proteins. Such molecules are not always associated with biology and can form from chemical reactions in deep space, but asteroids could have seeded Earth with the organic matter that led to life.

About three-quarters of asteroids in the solar system fall into the C-type.

This space rock was discovered in 1999 and not given a name until 2015. Ryugu is named after Ryugu-jo, or dragon’s palace — a magical undersea palace in a Japanese folk tale."""

With his eye trained on a large single-cell organism, called *Spirostomum*, he watched it do something that immediately made it his next research subject.

“I still remember for the very first time, seeing this organism swim by under the Foldscope,” said Prakash. “This is a massive cell but it contracts in less than a blink of an eye, accelerating faster than almost any other single cell. When you aren’t expecting it, it’s like it disappears. I remember being so excited, I had to bring the cells back to the lab and take a careful look.”

This observation, made through a simple tool only five miles from Prakash’s lab, has now led him and colleagues to the discovery of a new form of communication between cells, which they detail in a [**paper**](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1387-9) published July 10 in *Nature*. Without touching and without electrical or chemical signals, individual *Spirostomum* can coordinate their ultrafast contractions so closely that groups of them appear to shrink simultaneously – a reaction to predators that makes them release paralyzing toxins in sync.

“There are many different ways of communication in biology but this is really a new kind of signaling between cells that we’re trying to understand,” said [**Arnold Mathijssen**](https://profiles.stanford.edu/arnold-mathijssen), a postdoctoral scholar in the Prakash lab and lead author of the paper. “It’s possible this is more universal than we’ve described so far and is a way many different kinds of organisms communicate.”

President Trump's campaign is counterprogramming the debate and making a point — he is the president, running for reelection while Democrats are running against each other.

""More people will see this than will watch the debate today,"" said Daniel Hoffmann, director at Bully Pulpit Interactive, a digital agency associated with Democrats that tracks social ad spending by political campaigns. ""In our experience, we've seen the placement reach as many as 80 million Americans in a single day.""  
The campaign purchased what's known as the masthead on YouTube, the space at the top of the site's main page. It's an ad buy that can cost as much as $1 million for 24 hours of reaching every person who visits the video-sharing site, which is owned by Google.

The space is one of the most high-profile places to advertise online and is more commonly purchased for big movie premieres or brand launches than for politics.
