Adopted,fqmiciv,t3_gjpo4e,1589477932.0,"my mom never deals with her personal issues. it‚Äôs always her crying over the same stuff, and my dad and i try to calm her down. she makes the same excuses as to why she won‚Äôt do therapy or take medication or help herself. it‚Äôs just wine day after day after day with her, especially now that she‚Äôs working from home.

my parents separated a long time ago, my dad started sleeping on the couch about five years ago. they divorced a couple months ago. and they still live together because no one wants to look for a new place to live during a pandemic. they‚Äôre constantly arguing about little things. it‚Äôs usually my mom who gets upset first and my dad‚Äôs the one defending himself.

my family is relatively okayish financially. they can pay most bills, but they don‚Äôt have enough money to do what they want, they can‚Äôt afford retirement (dad‚Äôs turning 66, mom‚Äôs turning 64). i can‚Äôt even ask them to pay for some of my college because of this.

and i can‚Äôt even be upset because they adopted me from China of all places. like. yay thanks for saving me from that country but they could‚Äôve prepared for children better.

i just wish they were more prepared to raise two children. mentally and financial wise. i feel that before you have even one child, you need more money than you think and you need to be mentally stable.

recently, my dad told me i was sounding like my mom when i was crying and saying irrational things. i‚Äôm inheriting her unstable talk. ‚Äúi can‚Äôt do anything right‚Äù sort of stuff. you shouldn‚Äôt have to fix your parents and then be left with the rubble.

fix yourself before you have children. adopted or not."
