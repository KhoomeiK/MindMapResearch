I snapped to an extent where I wanted to cry in the classroom. She apologise but, she repeatedly did the same thing. I don't think she understood how affected I was with her actions and how hard for me to keep on living while I feel like nothing's worth it anymore. Now I don't know who to trust.

Behemoth was slayed but wow the game just got unenjoyable very quick with all these ""players"". At this point, I'd rather solo heroic and I don't mind the 5-8 minutes playthrough. I'd rather go through an 8 minutes game, than deal with these kind of BS."
