I have been using some of those. I used the CONSORT checklist that checks for proper reporting, and the Downs & Black checklist that assess quality. 

What I'm stuck on is assessing 'power' and whether the sample size is big enough to form a decent conclusion. 
Are there any popular resources to learn how to implement these measures? I've had a look online but it would be useful if you or anyone knows of some particularly good ones.
I'm not pooling the data, no."

VR is the future, and they‚Äôve re-invented the game with Alyx. To me that‚Äôs worth more (progress) than the fact that you need a VR headset in order to play the game."
