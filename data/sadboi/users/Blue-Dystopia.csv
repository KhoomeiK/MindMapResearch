depression,fcufj8l,t1_fcm595u,1577979731.0,"Hello there.. thank you for this incredibly thoughtful response. I'm sorry that you're in your current state, i understand more than I'd like to & i know just how awful it is.. the anxiety you get when thinking abt school & being bedridden.. I'm pretty much in the same state. You're right there's no rush its just that these days the world moves so fast & everyone you know seem to have it together & are doing great things but i know its important to put your health first..I'll try & hope you do to. 
I am thinking abt seeing a new therapist.. i know it usually takes a while before you find the right one but i can get impatient sometimes. 
Ppl really scare me but i do try to get myself out there & i hate being online too but since everyone seems to be here i might as well. You can message me here if you want if you don't mind me taking longer to respond.. i get anxious when ppl msg me & it takes a while before I'm okay enough to respond. 
I really wanna go back to school but I'm unmotivated & unfocused & can't get out of the house but I'll surely try to finish atleast.. we'll see if it all works out. I'm a fellow daydreamer as well & its the best ðŸ¤—.
I really appreciate your response & I've actually reread it many times because you make some excellent points. You put it well, we're all jyst trying to survive. Thanks again & i hope everything works out for you."
depression,fcucwe1,t1_fcm3zmy,1577978013.0,Hi... Thank you so much. Your words really mean a lot & I might take you up on that offer sometime.  ðŸ’™ðŸ’™ðŸ’™
depression,fcuchim,t1_fcm1hpy,1577977744.0,Hello there! It's very comforting knowing their are ppl out there that can relate to even the slightest parts of my problems. I like what you said abt not thinking abt the future & taking things day by day.. it really helps when i do try that too but sometimes i can't help but thinking abt it all. I'm sorry that you are lonely & I'm really sorry abt your gf.. can't imagine going through a breakup on top of all the crappy stuff in life but i can relate to the feeling of abandonment. Thank you for your kind words & i hope you find happiness soon as well.
depression,fcubot8,t1_fclz13f,1577977225.0,"Hi there! Thanks for your lovely words. I guess you are right, i should focus on easier short term goals.. I've been confused lately plus I'm just bad at setting any type of goal & working towards it, it would be easier if i had someone to do that stuff with in real life but i don't.. its a helpless situation I'm in but i still do appreciate your response and advice. Thanks again & hope everything goes good for you."
SuicideWatch,fcnbjhz,t1_fcm0s6y,1577808102.0,Oh it's everything to me.. thank you so much. I hope it does for you & all of us too.

SuicideWatch,fclyt8u,t1_fcly9p2,1577759811.0,Thank you so much.
SuicideWatch,fclv4oz,t3_e8gjky,1577757214.0,"I'm so so sorry this happened to you... it's incredibly heavy stuff & you're brave to share it.. it's not at all your fault don't for one second feel disgusting or disgusted with yourself.. i wish i could be of more help to you.. its important to surround yourself with ppl that are going to be sensitive & supportive.. god i really wish i could be of more help. The ppl who did this to you are evil & deserve to rot, i hope they do. I can't imagine what youve been & are going through.. you're 20, my age too.. you're still a kid you know, so plz don't be ashamed to seek help & support from family esp your parents. If ever you need someone to talk to & to listen to you I'm here so are dozens of other decent ppl.. & you know not just strangers on the internet.. professionals even probably a few understanding friends already in your life that you trust & feel comfortable around. Again, I'm so so sorry.. noone deserves this .. its not your fault & I'm here for you."
