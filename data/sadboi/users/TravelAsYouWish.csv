Firstly if we have all those wrestlers in a single brand we won't see said wrestlers as much, simply due to TV time. Secondly there are so many great wrestlers who wrestled in the indies for 5, 10, 15+ years who many of us have never seen. Having more promotions for me would mean seeing more great wrestlers and more wrestlers grow.

With that being said I would love for all 4 aforementioned promotions and AEW to be on good terms so we can see them exchanging wrestlers easily. And we could see more single feud or one night only.

I would also like someone like Ospreay and Saber to make bigger promotions in Europe and Oceania and be backed by all 5 aforementioned promotions. I think every continent should have at least one great wrestling show!"

Interferes matches with no rhyme nor reason just to cause chaos. And uses kid toys as weapons anything from swords to Legos to guns and light sabers.

The character is completely mute except 1 word that he never says on mic. That word is ""CANDY!"". He is also easily manipulated via candy which makes him a very weird partner and wrestler in triple threat especially when both sides have a valet or manager."

Also the Bucks of Youth have held 6-men titles with many members of the elite so it makes since.

I think the best champs for a 6-men title is Jurrasic Experience. But I think the inaugural champions should be Death Triangle and after 3+ months they would be defeated by Jurrasic Experience."

There is the ranking issue. However, they can make the ranking only count to any type of match involving weapons or cage or something of that sort.

With that being said adding such a title with the current roster size doesn't seem like a good. 

I am also pretty hesitant about the TNT Championship. Though the tournament seems great!

Another issue is that industry veterans like Janela who didn't have much exposure on TV and therefore people don't see him as world title material would be left out of the TNT title as well.
