1. Take advice seriously. The moment I did. I got respect for knowing my boundaries (insight). 

2. Take your meds. Get therapy. Again abide by your meds religiously. A major part of this routine (eat, sleep, etc.) Raise concerns when you can. 

3. Be selfish. If you aren’t genuinely well, how can you help anyone? Even yourself.

BipolarSOs,ew2ilj3,t3_cmfyxe,1565047620.0,"1. Meds. Take them. 
2. Abide by boundaries so much so that you remind yourself of the pain it’s caused you or others. 
3. Don’t act on impulse. Learn to wait. There’s hardly that many reasons to do something straight away. One way I’ve found works is to buffer stuff by not resorting to immediate forms of communication. I ask myself if it is important for them to know by text ie a recorded form of comms versus say just telling them in person. With the latter there’s a potential excuse where you can deny it and it ends up just being a rumour. The former there’s evidence and it can spread. 
4. Think consequences. Don’t jump off a bridge without thinking first, because if you don’t then it could hurt. 

All this comes with practice. But don’t beat yourself over not abiding by it all the time. But try to. That’s all we can do. To live our best life.  x"

I have bipolar (with rapid cycling) and this is what I’d say. But there are those here that will also provide a perspective (those who are SOs).

1. Medications. Take them. Without fail. He must take ownership of that. There are lots of reason for non-compliance: not understanding the illness, not appreciating the fallibility of medications (it’s no silver bullet but it’ll take the edge off to make him (and you) cope), not believing he has a problem. But once you have a Med that works it’s actually quite golden. 
2. Learn to develop coping behaviours when things get a little out of hand. It’s hard when he’s in the throngs of an episode, so awareness is super important then how he responds to that is then the next step. Next steps that don’t involve anger towards you, even violence is something that he needs to learn. And you can adapt your responses. It ain’t going to be good all the time but it’ll help. 
3. Empathy for him is important. Non-judgemental stance. But there’s empathy and then there’s just giving in to his excuses. Repeat offences should be responded with remorse on his part. Don’t feel guilty etc for not empathising. Unfortunately there has to be a line drawn somewhere. BPD can be co-morbid with personality issues so prising the two is important."

assholedesign,epx7oi8,t1_epwbn72,1559593988.0,"Before Google started blurring the prominence of ads it was obvious what was an ad and what was an organic link. People have grown aware of ads. They don’t click them largely because they’d rather go on organic links which by and large have much greater value. 

Your argument that it provides people with relevance is thus moot. Because Google actively has to blur the line between ads and good quality organic pages below it. So overall ads aren’t relevant or indeed helpful as you might think other wise the majority would click them which clearly they aren’t because Google needs to mask the fact they are ads now. 

I mention my business because it’s an example of ads not being useful in the industry we’re in. Customers still resort to organic links and don’t click on ads as much. So much so that when we removed ads we didn’t suffer in revenue - we actually grew. 

Also discovery of other products doesn’t necessarily mean that they benefit the customer. It can cause unnecessary choice paralysis. Interestingly in my market the competitors ads don’t last long as their budgets can’t sustain the spend. Customers later come to us saying that they regret purchasing the highly short term marketed product. 

I know plenty of people in marketing that justify their advertising spends with net positive ROIs. But a lot of them aren’t truly beneficial to the companies nor the consumer as they think. Marketing is very big business in commoditised markets. But again the choices are comparing over water and water so I don’t quite see how it benefits the consumer if anything it passes on the marketing spend to the consumer."
assholedesign,epw6zwx,t1_epv0sf2,1559567784.0,"Small companies don’t have as much money as larger companies. So my point about further exacerbation of these monopolies shunts innovation from newer companies. 

Obviously as a businessman I want to grow a monopoly but it does mean that competition gets stifled. 

Customers/users in the long term don’t get the best information because ad use by companies is predicated on how much a company makes not how well informed they are. 

Content marketing is the way forward especially as ads are saturating now. The problem for marketing is to show valid ROI on these long term strategies. Ads aren’t long term. 

We once spent £70k on a summer on ads for a project. That following summer I gambled and stopped ads. We saw the same amount of growth without ads (we made £500k, the previous year we made £400k. This is industry specific of course. It did teach us that visibility in our market for that product costs £70k+."

relationship_advice,epu1em2,t1_eptl9y1,1559501824.0,"Thank you for your response. 

I’m lucky. The business is self-sustaining with a great team. I hold the majority shares and get a stipend. There’s no commitment to work for it except be its CEO and make the decisions which carries a fair amount of stress but something I enjoy. I would not have got through medical school had I had to be busy with it so I’m very thankful. One of the reasons for me being quite lowkey is because it is the limited scope of work I do. And the highly privileged position I am in. 

I’m nothing like my father thankfully. I’m social. I got over my drink and drugs phase a long while ago and in any case I’m a very happy drunkard. I’m never violent even when hypo/manic. I’ve had to exercise stern views but that’s part and parcel of my role as CEO eg with mistakes employees have made but I’m very root cause analysis. Having said this however, I am aware of the stressors that led to my father’s behaviour, which I’m making sure not to be unaware of. 

My issues tend to be more clumsiness, which gets mistaken for deliberately being unconscientious. I’m quite headstrong but I’ve learnt to be quite persuasive or accepting when I need to protect relationships. I also have unresolved abandonment issues which isn’t obviously apparent on paper. My mother left me to fend for myself from a young age which exposed me to babysitters ie family members that weren’t appropriate (if that makes sense).she had her own problems which I had to tend to first. 

I gravitate towards people like my mum though and I’m struggling to get attracted to other types of women. I’m learning a little to let go but I’m finding other women not so attractive. I get attracted to women in power (not in a sado-masochistic way) and not because it’s in vogue but because I’ve dreamt about since I was young. I’m now 30. 

Having said this, I’ve missed my chance with some women who were just amazing but they’d already be in relationships some even married. At times, it’s come close to breaking up relationships and I actually regret not going through with it because I always put ethics/morals over my own future/feelings.

I have an interest in neuro/psychiatry. So I have always thought a bit too much on things. I just need to chill out a bit and thinking more about myself than being there everyone else."

You’re right. These aren’t really headstrong women. That’s quite eye opening. I’ve put it down to being young (though I’m young too) and not having to work hard at attracting guys. I’ve had to realise that attractiveness isn’t the sole determinant of compatibility. 

Medic girls tend to be quite empathetic and understanding. But they do go through their own mental health struggles which is why I feel like they’d understand better. 

But I do feel like their high maintenance. I’m attracted to them because my mum is somewhat emotionally high maintenance. I effectively grew up around her and gave her confidence so I feel like I could support a partner in the same fashion. My childhood yearns for a better nuclear family experience than the one I had. 

So tbh I feel like I could hack. I just have this hang-up about being a bank for a partner and nothing else. The odd thing about this is I’m well liked by my close friends and support them a lot too so I’m more than just my money and I guess it’ll only come out when I’m in a proper longer term relationship."

Don’t take it personally. Abuse of any kind unfortunately is contagious. Just make sure that you don’t project your abuse into others. Then the chain of abuse stops. THAT’S the most important thing. The sooner he realises this the better. AND it’s not your job to tell him that.
