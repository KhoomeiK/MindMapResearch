The majority or Trump-Epstein and Clinton-Epstein connections are blurry photos from the 80’s-2000’s. 

The Epstein-Barr connection is the fact that William Barr’s father gave Jeffrey Epstein a teaching job at the Dalton school for girls despite his lack of any real teaching qualifications.

From this graph I would agree with saying auto deaths have been decreasing before seatbelt laws but this is also likely due to more and more safety features being implemented in cars, seatbelts are just another safety feature like an airbag or an easily shattered windshield. 

But one could also say that many of those safety features were implemented as a result of legal requirements on auto manufacturers.

Ford had an issue with bad tires a while back that they didn’t bother to fix until legal action was taken.

> Defective Firestone tires on Ford Explorers took the lives of at least 271 people and seriously injured many more before the companies issued the largest tire recall in history. Internal company documents would later show that the two corporations had known of the deadly tire separation and associated rollover problems for years but had done everything they could to hide it. They were undeterred by federal regulators at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which only had the power to impose a maximum fine of $925,000.

>It was through the civil justice system that Donna Bailey was able to obtain some measure of justice. As part of her settlement, Ford agreed to release internal documents about the tire and rollover problems, and executives visited her to personally apologize.
Thanks to cases like that of Donna Bailey, the civil justice system publicly highlighted the problem and forced the companies and regulators to take action.

It was a horrible affront to law, justice, and American democracy then just as it is now, but I’m just reminding people that this kind of thing has been in the making since the appointment of William Barr as AG. This isn’t a new ‘crime of opportunity’ this has happened before and we still haven’t fixed the government.

North also wasnt welcomed back into the administration, he was just given a cushy FOX News gig. If Flynn works for the government again it will be a great leap forward for grifter kind."

Its not even a ‘show of aryan strength’ its literally white guys hiding from black guys because they fear them. How is this effective supremacist propaganda? How do these morons fuck up so bad at making propaganda??"
