depression,f9v4gyu,t3_e6wilf,1575662975.0,"This was me in middle school. For an entire semester I didn’t attend school and lay in bed for 15-20 hours a day. I only got up to go to rehearsals for a theater production I was in (which was in the evening). I didn’t see the sun. If I was awake I was binge watching tv shows (before binge watching was a thing most people did). I remember my mother asking me if I was depressed and I kept thinking “I don’t want to die, I’m not sad, so I must not be depressed.” 

But the thing is when I slept the dreams I had didn’t stay with me, I was asleep but wasn’t having dreams I remembered or playing in it was just SLEEP and it felt like an altered state of being. 

Now that I am functioning when I sleep my dreams are vivid and I can remember and experience them. I often wish I could hold onto those lucid states but I know if I were to try then it would fall back into a state of lethargy and my body would become weaker. 

Taking care of a body is so much work."
