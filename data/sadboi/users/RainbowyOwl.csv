I can tell you heimish has a very soft texture, it melts in your hands very quickly and rinses off clean. I have a dry-ish skin and it doesn't dry me out. It does have a scent, it's not overwhelming by any means, maybe a little citrus-y or flower-like? Can't really pinpoint the exact scent. It's not bad though, very fresh. I like it."

I often roast vegetables and my go to vegetables for that are broccoli, cauliflower, sweet potato and beets.   
I'm not much of a fruit person but I'll occasionally buy strawberries or bananas.

CAULIFLOWER RICE. I loooooove it with all of my heart. Broccoli rice is pretty good too. Can't make them myself because I don't have a blender sadface. 

From the shelves I always buy something to make sandwiches with - Sara Lee delightful bread, mini bagels or Xtreme wellness high fiber wraps.    

For snacks I always buy ice cream. It's my weakness and I refuse to give it up. I try to stick to low calorie options or mini ice creams. I also pick up either rice rollers, Quaker rice crisps or fiber one bars, just to have some variety.

I personally haven't noticed the foundation effect but I'll admit I really haven't looked at myself up close throughout the day with it on. Same with the staining, haven't noticed it on my glasses.
