cancer,fgu27s9,t3_f0a15q,1581112416.0,"Also lost my dad to cancer. He was an alcoholic but at least he was a happy drunk. Not very supportive or involved but he was around (when he wasn't working or off with his drinking buddies). It still hurt. What hurts most is knowing they won't be around to see you live your life. But he was in so much pain towards the end, we knew we had to ""let"" him go. I remember getting a few mins alone with him and telling him that I would be okay and that he didn't need to worry about us (his kids and wife). No matter what kind of parent your dad was, you'll always miss them. I'm just grateful he was even in my life even if he wasn't there all the time. You just have to focus on the good parts and that's what's going to help you cope with the loss. Hope you have some good memories of your dad and that they bring you a little bit of comfort right now."

I've been off my meds for uhhh a while now bc I can't afford to pay my psychiatrist bill (I have a missed appt bc I was at the HOSPITAL WITH MY BROTHER and apparently that wasn't a good enough ""excuse"") and feel semi okay. I've been in a depressive funk for a while and suicidal thoughts creep in but it's not as bad as it's been in the past. I think we are just really good at convincing ourselves that we are stable lol"
