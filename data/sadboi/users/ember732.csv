You just really have to take the “results” with a grain of salt and know that it’s not serious, because most characters in shows or movies are very extreme or unrealistic so you can’t actually compare yourself to them for the most part"

I’m not sure I’ve ever come so close to wanting to physically hurt someone, I just got up and moved but I couldn’t believe that there are people who are actually that fucking nasty and petty.

relationship_advice,fkblauc,t3_fhgk8g,1584035099.0,"As someone who was in a relationship with a similar person before (although not quite as bad), please get out of it. 

My ex was a sexist and I would try to debate with him sometimes and try to sort of get him to be more empathetic like you said you do, but this never ends well. You can’t change someone, and you shouldn’t be with someone who disagrees with you on fundamental issues, ESPECIALLY if they are about basic human rights!

One of the most useful pieces of relationship advice I’ve ever been given is “watch how he treats other people, not just you”. It sounds like your partner is abusive towards you anyway, but his treatment of others is also a red flag. Often abusers will be super nice and doting towards you in the beginning like you mentioned, but if you seen them being rude or cruel towards other people like your friends or even a waiter or your dog, then you can bet that they will eventually start treating you poorly as well. Plus, wouldn’t you rather be with someone who’s a good person? Trust your instincts. It seems like you already know what to do.

PS the “walking on eggshells” feeling is a major red flag of a toxic/abusive partner. Like, textbook red flag."

BPD,fk8w4za,t3_fh2drc,1583964022.0,"i relate to this completely. i’ve definitely had destructive and wild moments where i lashed out at people or did something extremely reckless, but for the most part day-to-day i’m just like you said. i’m incredibly shy unless i’m drinking or with close friends/family. but i understand the dichotomy you mentioned too because i’ll often be really quiet and try to go unnoticed, but then also get mad or hurt if no ones paying attention to me. i’ve had a lot of romantic partners/exes describe me as “distant,” which you probably wouldn’t expect a BPD partner to be, but i think my way of responding to the anxiety and insecurity that come with BPD is “flight” rather than “fight” usually. i just detach or don’t say much for fear of judgment or rejection."

also, maybe a dumb question but... does this mean the clone theory is true and the two of them (her and her grandma) are both traveling through time and sometimes overlap, like in that scene?

or, is it like sarah says later, and she IS her grandma? i.e. there aren’t two of them but they are one in the same... but then how was there two of them in that scene and the one with the horse in front of the store? ahhhh"

antinatalism,fk4zjwo,t1_fk4w7y0,1583870617.0,"i see what you’re saying , but your assumption that people don’t kill themselves because they actually don’t hate life that much is incorrect. sure, that might be true for some people, but in many cases i think it’s also because of a fear of death and/or the painful experience of dying. this just proves to again highlight the selfishness and lack of empathy in bringing a person into the world (against their own will), forcing them to have to confront their own mortality and eventually to die, either by natural causes or by suicide. if you are equating suicide with never having been born, i’m sorry but you’re extremely mistaken. a person who has never been born (aka nonexistent) doesn’t have to go through the misery and suffering leading up to a suicide, the painful decision, the fear inherent in it, and the physical pain that would come with it."

BPD,fj1qkwe,t3_fb1qk7,1582925605.0,"i don’t know the full situation but feeling superior to others in video games is not necessarily a bad sign or warning bell of NPD... could be that you were just feeling competitive, which is common when playing games like that... i mean i think in a sense everyone becomes a bit narcissistic when they are in competition of any kind. 

it also seems like you have some remorse or maybe just feelings of shame? and you haven’t really expressed many grandiose views or entitlement, but again, i don’t know the full situation and would never attempt to “diagnose” you or discount your experience.

my best suggestion would be to try to get out and get out of your own head as much as possible. isolation like that can cause us to ruminate a lot and go down some dark paths, and get a little self obsessed. trust me, i’ve been there. try going somewhere and being around people, even if it’s not a social engagement or anything, and ideally doing something active like go for a walk in the park maybe. sometimes i’ll just go to my favorite bookstore and sit and read/work, and even though i’m not really interacting with anybody, just being out of my house and around people really helps."

and yeah i think you’re definitely right, i guess it’s just hard to come to terms with. 

and i will definitely check that book out! i’ve seen a few other people recommend it in this sub so i definitely want to read it.

and yeah i definitely feel better without all the shame and anxiety of waking up after a blackout, but sometimes i also kind of enjoy it weirdly. i know that probably sounds terrible, but i think it’s this sort of chaos addiction thing... obviously not heAlthy either. 

thanks again, it’s so great to have input and support!"
stopdrinking,fire99v,t1_fircs3s,1582662727.0,"yeah i know what you mean, sometimes it makes me feel like i’m going insane because i don’t know which thoughts/perceptions to trust. and i think you’re right"
stopdrinking,fire6lc,t1_firalv3,1582662686.0,"wow a year sounds like such a long time, props to you! honestly at this point , i’ve decided i’m just gonna try to go 30 days without and see how i feel/if i can even do it (i’ve also heard from AA people this can be a good test)

thanks for the comment! good luck in your efforts!"
stopdrinking,fire0ls,t1_fir9cj6,1582662595.0,"yeah it’s true... the only issue is, i really want to go to AA because i like the community and the steps etc and think it would help, but i don’t wanna go there and say “hi i’m ___ im an alcoholic” if it isn’t really true you know? just feels wrong.

thank you so much for the comment! i really appreciate the support"
stopdrinking,firduiv,t1_fir79xy,1582662502.0,thank you. yeah i just looked up those stages and i feel like i’m definitely “dependent” but maybe not “addicted” yet so it does seem like a good time to stop.
stopdrinking,firdqgs,t1_fird1uj,1582662441.0,thanks for the reply. yeah i have definitely wondered if my obsession with the label “alcoholic” is just a way to avoid taking action by making things out to be black and white. thanks for the advice too!
stopdrinking,fir9dpp,t1_fiq76xd,1582659980.0,this made me laugh and is so spot on! really puts it in perspective
stopdrinking,fir7uh0,t1_fiqj31e,1582659101.0,what kinds of withdrawal symptoms if i may ask?
stopdrinking,fir6yvj,t1_fiql71o,1582658603.0,"curious what you mean exactly by it being a disorder of self-centeredness. would you mind talking more about that? 
i feel like i can definitely see what you mean and feel that it is true"
relationship_advice,fiqy5v2,t3_f9aikn,1582653722.0,"but also, is there a chance he’s just in denial about being asexual and lying to himself and to you? i’m not sure what your conversations have been like but seems like a distinct possibility from the info we’ve gotten so far. maybe he’s not been fully truthful about the porn/jerking off and past sexual experiences?

guys can be really self conscious about not being able to perform because they’re supposed to just want sex all the time according to society’s standards, so he but just not be willing to admit it to himself (or to you)."
relationship_advice,fiqwvv2,t3_f9aikn,1582653087.0,i had a similar situation with an ex and it was because he was depressed so his libido had dropped a lot. that could explain it if as you say he’s had sex before and enjoyed it.
alcoholism,ezw9bjq,t1_ezvqenj,1568211270.0,"Yeah, it’s funny you say that because that’s exactly what I have suspected she might have. I personally was diagnosed BPD so it would make sense but I definitely feel like there could be a NPD component there too"
tattoos,eos5d4h,t1_eos0tij,1558817888.0,genuinely posted for info and not attention but ok! thx for the attention! 😃
