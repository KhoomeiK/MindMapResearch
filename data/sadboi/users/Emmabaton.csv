Your points were valid, the brand must of been quite a ‚Äútiny‚Äù niche market, I had no idea what it was either, but we see quite few folks yearn over  brands solely based on a label, I am going to guess this is no different, which means it is probably expensive and trendy and I wonder if they loved it cuz of the style or because a fashion blog said it is trendy?  

You kind of made a point in your post that fashion sense and expression is personal, but here it seems that if it is not haute couturier, it can be snobby and juvenile here imo, and wonder if these folks are just following trends and using their partners platinum card lol? 

A good idea of style is personal, not following what the media tells you, it is what you feel comfy wearing. 

The post was the only post down voted and it is the only one that spoke against our questioned  the brand, kind of reminds you of a warrior hiding behind a keyboard. It is good to get others opinions instead of down voting a person for not being a sheep. 

Landmark brands can fetch the money they ask but maintain capital, so I am curious they were  stretched to thin prior and it was run in to the ground? 

It cool be the last two months was the tipping point to a poorly run business? 

I think your post was good, as it offered an opinion and it was wrong it got down voted because you did not follow the ‚Äúsheep‚Äù and ‚Äúchallenged‚Äù the assertions to promote a discussion but is kind of expected here from reading others threads that this happens often when others offer opinions that should be welcomed."
