BPD,fkxssec,t3_fl4ksa,1584634734.0,"I relate so much to this. I hate being alone so I always have a boyfriend in my life, but as for friends, people always say I am so sweet and outgoing but never want to be my friend."

I wish you the best!"
BPD,fkxs6l5,t3_fl3rzp,1584634394.0,"I understand this but it is weird because I have a huge sex drive around people who I am not in a relationship with or new relationships, but if I date someone for a long time I go from wanting to have sex multiple times a day to not wanting them to touch me at all for months."
BPD,fkt4s1f,t1_fkrulfu,1584506252.0,"Thank you so much. This was really helpful to read and much different from the responses on a different subreddit where I was berated for being a terrible person and was “going to die alone at 30” (posted using an anon account). Anyways, I hope you have found happiness and are doing well, and it is relieving to hear that this happens to other people because I have a tendency to do this with all my long term relationships. I have self reflected and realize there was a lot I didn’t love about my last relationship, however, they weren’t “dealbreakers”, they were just pet peeves more than anything. I am starting to forgive myself because there is a chance that there is someone out there (maybe this new guy) that can make me all around happy and not just give me a stable relationship."

BPD,fkt4ck6,t1_fksm9r8,1584505901.0,"Thank you so much, this was great to read. I actually was typing this post when I was feeling really down, but I spent today with the new guy and it has made me feel a lot better about my decision. Unlike my ex he worked out with me all day, ate healthy, talked about his and mine’s feelings and we watched one of my favorite shows all without having to suggest any of it. He really is amazing and I am feeling more confident about what I did even if I do still feel bad for ending things so impulsively. He meets my needs where I need them and I am excited to see what my future has for me. I have a job interview tomorrow and I am focusing on my physical health which is the new guy is helping me with tremendously. I know you didn’t ask for this huge response, but it is really my way of saying thank you for helping me self reflect."

We were 15 and he didn’t think it was loaded so he figured he would point it at my stomach and pull the trigger. I am still grateful he didn’t aim at my face.
