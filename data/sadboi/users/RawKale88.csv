2019 sucked so bad for me, I went through multiple antidepressants and benzodiazepines, trying to understand what was happening. I had never gone through such negativity and self-loathing. I was set to work in 2019 and it didn't happen at all which led to guilt bc my partner was always stressed about money and I knew I could help him but I couldn't get up and face anything. I felt the lowest I've ever felt and wondered when he would leave me for someone who had it together. I cried so much, it was the worst year of my life. I was diagnosed with BP2 in summer and things improved some with meds but still I struggled. I'm trying to learn to savor life's tiny victories, this kitchen looked like a dumpster 2 days ago."

Even when I know I'm being mean or pushing people away it feels like this defense mechanism where I lead myself away from a deeper connection with my spouse. I then hate myself for it and when a depressive state comes on I'm much worse on myself. 

The best thing you can do I would think is to stay aware of those instances and try to lessen them or have a sort of safe word system. That's what my husband and I have, when I'm feeling overwhelmed and irritable I say: Ceiling fan. And he then knows to not take things so personal and to give me space. Idk if that will help. As long as we are all trying to do better that's honestly all we can do.

Even after I'd ask and days would pass, I'd revert back to only wanting to be monogamous. So for me it definitely only crossed my mind when I was hypomanic.
