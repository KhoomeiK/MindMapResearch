For me I mean, function wise. Like, I used to be creative but Now I cant express myself. I have a hard time stringing thoughts together when I used to be so articulate . I don’t trust myself. I can’t connect with myself and I can’t connect with others. Talking, walking, breathing, everything is awkward and uncomfortable. I’m  A spectacle. People talk at me but don’t connect with me.

I don’t think suicide is selfish. I think what’s selfish is other people demanding we stay alive to make their lives easier. I love my family but if they truly want the best for me they wouldn’t want to see me suffering for the rest of my life 🤷🏽‍♀️

How long am I in this situation? Well I’ve been depressed since I was a child. As I’ve gotten older I’ve started a career, started dating again, started new hobbies and doing all the things I feel should help me feel happy. But in the end it’s all superficial. I can’t shake the internalized self loathing, Loneliness and helplessness I feel 🤷🏽‍♀️
