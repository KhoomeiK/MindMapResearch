Second hospital diagnosed me with that flu even after the knee I was negative for it. Apparently the criteria in Arizona to be tested for the virus is only if you've been in close contact with someone who has a confirmed case. It's ridiculous."

And I know about issues that you have described all over the state's. Go to a community salon that CARES about their career and YOU. Real salon professionals don't care just about the money, they care about their image and they ALWAYS put their clients first. If you have any questions on choosing the right salon you can message me and I'll give you some tips."
