Glitch_in_the_Matrix,ffe3j39,t1_ffe2j4l,1579835757.0,"I do have a space family! So far it is many members of my ‚ÄúEarth family.‚Äù Two nights ago, we were talking, i was asking questions.. specifically to my dad. It was the first time we had communicated that way. I was sad because this meant that at some point he would leave his physical form in this world (clearly..) cried, and asking if it was soon. He assured me that it wasn‚Äôt. I also communicated with an ex-boyfriend that I cant get over. Thoughts of him follow me everywhere. He was there, I cried and told him how much I love him. We discussed that we will not be together again in this physical form, but that we will be together again.. in another space and time. So much weight off the shoulders after that insight.
If you listen to music much.. similarly movies, books etc (music is the medium i hear it most), there is the constant reference to ‚Äúa different space and time.‚Äù There is so much truth to that. This is simply one space and time.
Best of luck in your travels! Maybe speak it out to the world that you need a sign, some form of conformation that this exists. That is what I did a few days prior to this last experience. Stay intrigued and the rest will fall into place. Hope you communicate soon!"
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,ffdx7h1,t1_ffd66us,1579831165.0,"I had a connection with my space family two nights ago. It has happened once before, but Brushed it off. Not because i didnt believe in what had happened,  but honestly it was very confusing. What happened two nights ago was very similar, but this time i wasnt afraid. Talked to so many members, expressed so much love.. lost of crying. It was a beauty experience, and for any non-believers.. if it is in any way possible to open up to the idea of this taking place.. you may find yourself in another space and time. 
Feel very recharged and reminded that Earth is simply once tiny blimp on our consciousness‚Äôs radar.
Blessings!
Additionally.. to attest to the point on medical examination.. there were a few brief moments while communicating with the family when i had opened my eyes up just a bit, and there were outlines of a couple of figures as well as a bright light above. 
Let it also be known that i was stone cold sober!! Very rad, hope all of you that seek this experience may find it some day."

awakened,fbwtn6z,t1_fbwmnhk,1577159117.0,"This thread is resonating very strongly, having had a similar experience to what you have written about. However, rather than OSDD, I am Bipolar 1. Having done a lot of thinking about the notion that people with these mental ‚Äúdiseases‚Äù need to be brought to the ‚Äúbase level normal‚Äù through medication. Having been diagnosed with depression for years before this much more accurate Bipolar categorization, medication seemed crucial. However, after a couple bouts of mania, the idea that we may all be on a bit of a different/higher frequency than ‚Äúnormies.‚Äù It feels as though my last manic episode brought me closer to enlightenment than any meditation or psychedelic ever has. 
Name one genius that isnt crazy... you feel me?
Great post! Love knowing that there are others on a similar frequency. Cheers!"

AskReddit,f5q508w,t1_f5oj1og,1572372636.0,"Interesting comparison and valid point. A friend told me that when one the dark web there is still a  need to have a web address, very similar to the ""normal"" internet. For example, to access a specific trafficking ""site"" (for a lack of a better subject matter) you must enter a specific IP address, frequently consisting of long strings of various numbers. To find something you need to be told the ""site"" to visit. Simply accessing the dark web will not produce an entire feed of what there is on there (think Reddit) but is in fact much more difficult than one might think. 
No specific information, OP. Just thought this might be an interesting addition to this thread."

TrueOffMyChest,f0ny9za,t3_d5t4mf,1568785543.0,"Had an eerily similar day.. from depression to teeth, to weed, to the bill, to craft. Hopefully, it brings you solstice knowing that there is another person out there feeling damn near spot on to how you are feeling. 
I guess a major take away from the day is.. getting up and out of bed and just trying to be a little better today than yesterday counts in the long run. It's difficult to be grateful for bills and teeth issues (especially if you are in the US and have no dental insurance.. which is the case on this end), but chalking it up to the universe and knowing that I've got some karma to work out one way or another provides just a bit of comfort. 
For instance, being on Reddit in bed before bed is not a usual occurrence, but here we are with very similar days coming to terms with what they were and remaining as positive as possible. I guess what I'm trying to say is that the universe must have placed us here so that I could say that I'm proud of you :) today was rough but tomorrow will be better. There's a lot to be said for trying, never forget it. One day at a time and take it easy my friend!"
