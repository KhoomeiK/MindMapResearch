I also looked up some other examples that are less extreme than human brain maybe. Shark livers make upto 30% of their body weight (compared to 2% in humans), and have taken on the auxiliary function of maintaining buoyancy. The evolution of this liver was an evolutionary leap that enabled them to forage in a wide range of depths (source: [https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/11/171127152041.htm](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/11/171127152041.htm))"

We collectively will fight these issues because we have no choice. Keeping calm and thinking through our plans will help us in this fight.  
What calms down such paranoia for me is to contemplate on stories about other people's struggles and how humans, with their enormous courage, can overcome hurdles successfully sometimes. Novel/movies on sportspersons often infuse that sense of hope in me- that life is tough but there are fellow human beings who overcome insurmountable struggles successfully, every day. Because we can be stupidly brave and stubborn.  
Also being in nature, away from people, can feel good sometimes, though I recognize it's a privilege. When I reflect on the permanence of mountains, and hills, and oceans, and rocks, and of life on earth, I recognize as humans we are just ""part of the play"", in a sense.

I had a lot of internalized self hate that came from trying to not be like him, because we are similar in some aspects. After working on lots of my own issues in therapy, I have recognized that my mom is mentally ill and she harbors a lot of resentment towards my father. I had picked up on it as a child. I still do not want to be like my father, but only the bad aspects. I am trying to forgive him now for being so absent in my childhood and not seeing anything wrong with how i hated him. My hatred for him has changed to indifference or gentle care. I thought I loved my mom in my childhood, but a lot of it was actually some version of Stockholm syndrome. Now I recognize the damage she has done and still doing to me and I don't think I can ever forgive that. I still crave imagining what it would be like to have a proper father figure, though.

I am glad that you can talk about your own issues with this much clarity, it took me seven years longer to do that.

mentalhealth,f8viaqd,t3_e2hj8f,1574870076.0,"Here are some insights on my own journey to reduce my self loathing. I use a mindfulness meditation technique where I exercise the [observant ego](https://annveilleux.com/2009/07/21/the-observing-ego-and-request-for-feedback/). It involves detaching my logic from my immediate daily experiences and emotions and trying to critically analyze my actions like I would for other people. Like a protagonist of a comic series I closely follow, I know all the actions and drama and failures and successes intricately, and regardless of any shortcomings I would always want the best for the protagonist.  


This is a version of self love I have managed till now. It is still fleeting and very conditional on how ""successful"" I am (effect of my upbringing). But the observant ego tells me in a non-partisan way what is the best thing I should do to feel happy or successful, and as long as I get off my ass and do that, I feel fulfilled and satisfied with myself."

2. Meditate to calm down the anxiety- even religious meditation is good. The point is to remind oneself that the world does not revolve around you, you matter very little in the big scheme of things, and every persons life is at least as complicated as yours. Regardless, some people work extraordinarily hard to become great. The point is to recognize and feel quietly inspired by the unbelievable amount of hard work it takes to do anything of significance. If you're nonreligious, this article might help- waitbutwhy.com/2014/10/religion-for-the-nonreligious.html

1. Daily exercise, because endorphins reduce anxiety.

2. A specific kind of meditation, where I try to disassociate myself from my immediate concerns and can critically reflect on everything happening around me. I don't know if there's a name for it, but my therapist calls it the observant ego. It humbles me, makes me realize the world does not revolve around me, shows me everything that other people are going through and are overcoming, and gives me motivation for all my work. Keeping these in mind all the time gives me a deep sense of peace.

You need to acknowledge that as much responsibility you have for updating the PI about your progress, they have the exact same (if not more) responsibility to communicate their expectations and feelings clearly and not be passive aggressive. Someone else suggested that the PI might not be happy with your data,- that sounds very possible to me, especially in academia where human beings are equated to the (""positive"") results they produce.

&#x200B;

What helped me was that I maximized my daily contact with my PI, to the point that it might be a bit annoying and childlike and not good for my independent learning, but then my PI doesn't have any extra expectations/hopes from/about me, since they know exactly what I am working on currently. I prioritize my mental health over trying to be independent in research and having confrontations with the passive aggressive PI.

For the current situation, you should go talk to your PI asking for the feedback you want, or keep sending them increasingly frequent reminders till they respond. You have to make it clear that passive aggressiveness/gaslighting is not okay. And for later maybe adopt my strategy."
