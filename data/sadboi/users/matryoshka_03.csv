I know that seeing a doctor is my best option, and I’ve had the possibility of hormonal imbalance a few years ago when I reached obesity because of depression, I think it has something to do with it. 
Although from then I naturally started becoming more self conscious and my mother Isnt exactly a function-able mother and I am too anxious to go on my own
And I had done a couple of laser treatments and it helps for a bit and help it a little in the area around my cheeks but it always comes back in a matter of months and the cycle repeats itself. Now I’ll probably be unable to continue doing due to a worsening relationship with my mother who allegedly pays for it :("

diabetes,fjufnre,t3_feywyc,1583616414.0,"I really understand you. It was the same for me, I was diagnosed 2 years ago and hospitalized for a week with blood sugar or 427. And I’m just a teen, which is also why I totally understand being ashamed of it cause it really has a lot to do with lifestyle, which is already unhealthy pretty much everywhere. Keeping yourself healthy is really a task of its own but you can do it! It’s probably pretty hypocritical of me to say since I haven’t taken care of this matter in more that a year now because I’m so ashamed and scared of what others would think that I just neglected it. Please don’t let yourself sink into those fears, as they will make it far worse and prevent you from getting better. I think it’s important to balance your blood sugar first and then get help from doctors regarding of what exercise you should do and how you should eat and live. With the right amount of motivation and will, you’ll do it in no time and adopt yourself a good lifestyle! Please don’t be dumb like me and neglect it because you’ll regret it later. Don’t let the anxiety of what others think and say affect you. 
And please, don’t blame yourself. I know lifestyle is a choice but often this is too much to take care of with the stressful environment and every day life we have created for ourselves, watching it all at the same time takes a great amount of energy. Don’t focus on why this happened to you and how ashamed of it you are, focus on getting better and healthier, because that is what is really important. I’m cheering on you!"

DreamInterpretation,fj6hz61,t1_fj692ma,1583072404.0,"Maybe they do, I do seek social acceptance sometimes just like everyone else, but I think I do it unintentionally. I have very bad social anxiety so I am never able to bring up these topics to people irl, but whenever I am being understood by someone or praised by someone for something good I did I wouldn’t say I feel at ease , but I do feel somewhat excited. I do hide it though because a big part of me is ashamed of wanting to be accepted by someone or wanting an actual positive remark, which are things I can’t recall occurring too many times in my childhood. I usually don’t know what to do with myself when someone throws a positive remark or praises me, I usually just glare even if I don’t mean it since I just don’t know how to respond, unlike a negative remark which could get two general responses out of me : either crying or becoming extremely angry and anxious , depends on my mood or if I’m having an episode etc

Also the age is probably just because I am scared to death of anything that goes under the title of “pedophile”. Ofc it’s much deeper than that but I can’t recall anything that happened to me that has to do with that, or either I have experienced something and my brain just wanted to forget it to ease on my emotional irregularities since a young age"

The kind I mean isn’t every old dude it’s just... perverts kinda? Creepy guys who fap to underage fiction and all of that. Everyone would be scared of that but I think I am actually terrified of them"
DreamInterpretation,fj6gbhw,t1_fj67uza,1583071028.0,"My bad, I did not mention it but yes I am female.

Firstly, thank you for taking your time to write all of this, I am truly grateful.
I’ll answer each paragraph by chronological order:

In my early childhood until 6th grade-ish I was always referred to in male pronouns by friends ( we had this kind of thing , though I am not dysphoric and prefer being a female). This has not made me feel uncomfortable, but in elementary school I did look like a boy and was thought to be a boy by complete strangers, something that has affected me deeply and terrifies me until today ( I’m still quite neutral, but as of late I have started trying to get more feminine because of flashbacks I have to these times that cause me to feel anxious and uncomfortable. For example: started wearing earrings, hair bows, shorts and even wore a skirt for the first time in years a few days ago ).


This could be out of some trauma if I understood you correctly, I have experienced a lot of traumatic events in my life that were all brought up together eventually and put me in the situation where I am right now, which is the worst it has ever been ever since it started. I question myself a lot if I have experienced some sort of sexual abuse or pedophilia when I was younger but I can never recall anything. I remember all of my traumas of course, and I always feel that I have experienced something of that kind due to my behavior ( hypersexuality which I really detest, intrusive sexual thoughts that are only getting worse with time , nightmares that involve such topics etc ). 


Overweight guys are not my type, despite being slightly overweight myself ever since I remember myself. I do not hate them of course, and I find it terrible that my head judges people like that without my control , but unfortunately the first thought that jumps to my mind when an overweight guy (very overweight, not only slightly like myself) approaches me is that something terrifying is going to happen to me, most likely sexual assault or even worse. Though some cases aren’t as scary to me ( I have an overweight brother who isn’t my biological brother but is the son of my non biological father , a real sweet guy that could never cause harm to anyone, as well as a history teacher that reminds me of him, so I am not scared when they approach me as I feel no danger in them ).
I also was never the correct weight for my age and height and was constantly shamed for it by my mother and classmates in elementary school ( have some very clear memories of people that I can’t stand to this day calling me fat in various ways and forms ).
I also have very deep hatred towards pedophiles from both sexes.


I am terrified of sexual assault or anything sexual in any way. I don’t mind it in others but it terrifies me in myself. Even anything that is out of pure, not malicious intention, like having mutual sexual intercourse as lovers makes me feel uncomfortable.

The thing is, I have no extreme look on gender and on men. Actually, it angers me when others, especially women degrade men and believe them to be all the same as the false image they have of them. Me and my sister don’t have any sort of extreme thoughts on who makes food, we both agree that it should be made solely for survival with no context to gender, though we do dislike hearing about cases of bossing people around , but we also both agree that we hate it the same when a woman does so to a man.

That is just information that I did not mention but since I could link it to some things you said I said it, I do see where you’re coming from in some things you said and understand them. 

I really appreciate your help a lot . It hasn’t yet made me understand anything but it at least gave me a direction of what I should try to think of. Thank you very very much!"
