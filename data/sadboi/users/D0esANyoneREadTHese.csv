diytubes,fr3mkwk,t1_fr3lho4,1589860767.0,"I'm not regulating the output of the microwave transformer by default, just rectifying it. What I did was just take all the Kapton tape off the secondary winding, heat it up to soften the potting, and pull one winding out per ""layer"" to strip and solder a tap onto. Microwave transformers are 20 to 1 step-ups, and mine had around 20 layers on the secondary, so each layer was one multiple of the 120V mains. The 36V winding was due to the outermost layer having less turns for whatever reason, so I added my first tap to the BOTTOM of the secondary instead of the top like the other ones. After I got up to a reasonable voltage, I just pulled several more taps out and just cut them out to isolate them so there wasn't 2400 volts flapping in the breeze, and I also disconnected the chassis connection for the innermost winding for the same reason.

And making a cathode/emitter follower linear supply is pretty easy, most of the schematics include a lot of extra stuff for noise suppression and the like but my linear supply is just a bridge rectifier, a 50k potentiometer in series with a neon bulb as a reference voltage, and a 13003 transistor to the wiper of the pot. Works okay, a little ripple if it's loaded hard and turned up all the way, but not bad for a bare-minimum-viable solution. Could easily adapt it to tubes, and I probably will if I get some high power tubes since my transistors aren't as high voltage as I'd like."

I have a dim-bulb > Variac > isolation transformer > high voltage linear regulator bench supply. Also have a microwave transformer I've cut half the secondary out of (2400 volts makes me uncomfortable) and added taps for various voltages (36, 60, 120, 240, 360, 480, 720) so I can have high voltage isolated B+ as well as using the isolated 6.3V filament supply, although that doesn't run off the Variac since the reactance is mismatched so it sucks a ton of power.

I'm not really looking for hifi gear either so sound quality isn't much of a concern, I've just got a bunch of oldschool projects I wanna try out for things you can't buy kits for anymore. The magic eye tubes (well, one of them) are probably gonna end up in a signal tracer or capacitor tester, I'm probably gonna use some of those 6j1s in a superhet receiver (only have 2 right now, hence why I made a regenerative set instead), and I dunno what I'm gonna do with the power tubes but they seem like something handy to have, they're at least gonna be the final stage for the radio and signal tracer tho.

diytubes,fr3a0pf,t1_fr383dw,1589852976.0,"I know the REASON tubes sound ""like tubes"" and I know how to make Chinese tubes sound like that. As I said, it's not my first rodeo with cheap Chinese stuff. The main problem is that the Chinese amplifiers don't run them near their limits, the tube sound is second-order distortion from ""soft clipping"" which is hard to do when they're running them at such a low plate voltage - 35 to 56 volts on a tube meant for 170V B+ - and use oversized grid bias capacitors so they operate firmly within their linear region. They also tend to skip output transformers and either rely on you having high-impedance phones or a solid-state final stage, and the output transformer is an overlooked part of what shapes the sound - hysteresis pulls down the high frequencies, and saturation adds extra soft-clipping to the bass, especially when the volume is cranked. 

Also most Chinese tubes are beam tetrodes or sharp cutoff pentodes, which don't have the quirky voltage curves that screen-grid pentodes or triodes have, so a dual 6j1 (Chinese pentode) based preamp is gonna sound slightly different to a single 12AU7 (American dual triode) in the same application, but the same could be said if you tested it with an American 6AK5 instead of a 6j1. One fix is to run them in a triode-strapped configuration, where the screen grid is tied to the plate with a high value resistor instead of to cathode. Lower gain, but easier to distort, and brings back the quirky voltage curve for a more interesting sound."

The tube sounds exactly like a transistor in this range, unless you crank the volume of the input source waaaay up so things start to soft clip - THAT'S the tube sound. 

Also, this is using low impedance transistors for the final stage output, what you really want is to use high impedance (either tube OR transistor) run through an iron-core output transformer - it adds more soft clipping to very low bass and the hysteresis losses suppress some of the treble, which is the OTHER, often overlooked, reason tube amps sound good."

Nothing magic, make sure the pinout, channel (N or P), and package are the same, and that the voltage/amperage/wattage ratings are same or higher. I'd say look at voltage curves and stuff but it's switch-mode so not really something to worry about in this scenario."

18650masterrace,fppk0mn,t3_geeamq,1588803702.0,"Yeah, that's how this works. 1200 watts at wall voltage comes out to 10 amps, but accounting for inefficiency it's closer to 12 amps. Well, wall voltage is 10 times higher than battery voltage, so that means to get the same wattage your battery current has to be 10 times the wall current because Watts = volts x amps.
At 1C it's around 3 amps per cell according to the datasheet, that comes out to about 90 amps for a 30p pack. At full inverter power, which you probably won't use often or for very long at a time, you're only running them at 1.3C which is well within their safe limits, so I'd go with 30P. 

As for how many in series/parallel, if you have ""almost 200"" and need to work an off-the-shelf 12V lead-acid inverter I'd go with a 3S pack instead of 4S, as others have said, they've got a high-voltage cutoff that won't let you charge the batteries fully at 4S. You might have to crack the inverter open and modify it to remove/change the low-voltage cuttoff, as a lot of them don't play nice with 3S lithium packs and in my experience will only let you discharge the cells to 30% or so before it cuts off. Not terribly difficult if you know electronics, usually it's a PCB trace coming straight off the fuse and going to the microcontroller that runs the show, sometimes directly or other times with a resistor divider. If it uses a resistor divider you can change the resistors to change the cutoff voltage, or if it just senses directly you can just cut the trace and hook it to a reference source that always feeds it 12V (like a garage door remote battery) since the microcontroller isn't pulling much current to sense from."
18650masterrace,fpphlgd,t1_fpnp9vk,1588802416.0,"Probably just that 12V is more available, you pretty much always have to special-order 24/36/48V inverters because they're for solar setups or the like but everybody and their dog uses 12V inverters for running stuff off of car batteries, so watt-for-watt they're usually cheaper and you can get them at the store."

CatastrophicFailure,fpmd7d0,t1_fplu4t1,1588730522.0,"Cheap refrigerators are scary, the motor contactors are vented and now that CFCs and most other non-flammable refrigerants are banned, they've almost universally gone to R600a - literally butane. If you get a leak, such as from condensation corroding the pipes from being in a humid room, butane accumulates behind the fridge where the air isn't disturbed much and when the contactor kicks on or off it sparks. Sometimes the contactor also sets off other gas sources, such as a blown-out pilot light on a stove, but refrigerant doesn't have mercaptan added so you can't smell a leak. Usually there's a bunch of flammable dust on the condenser coils and top of the fridge, as well as the fridge being a popular place to set flammable items like flour, sugar, pet food, coffee creamer, etc so shit can go from zero to ""uncontrollable"" before you can even turn around to see it.

E: the contactor sparking issue was even mentioned in NileRed's latest video, you need a special refrigerator for use in laboratories or mines where flammable vapors are present, lots of college labs have had explosions from people storing solvents in normal refrigerators."
