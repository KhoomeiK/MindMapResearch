AskReddit,f4udl53,t3_dlucrk,1571806601.0,"So im a 22 year old female and I've never actually been in a real, serious relationship before. I have been on dates and what not, but never ended up in a relationship. Ive never been very open with my emotions/feelings either and always had feelings of inadequacy in general. 
 I liked someone in the past that i used to work with, however i never told him because he had a girlfriend and i knew, either way that i probably wasn't his 'type'. That alone kinda sucks. Granted, ive gotten over it a lot. But i still question whether relationships are worth the possibility of getting your heart broken.
 
I guess this was just something that was randomly on my mind and i just felt the need to ask others"

Everyones story/experience is different. For me a lot of it was a coping mechanism for my emotions and a way to 'compensate' for feeling worthless and wanting to disappear."

fuckeatingdisorders,eu5gvw0,t1_esdh0dl,1563477311.0,Absolutely. Starving myself numbs me a lot like cutting did.. and purging gives a similar physical 'release' of negative feelings/emotions. I heard that purging releases endorphins like cutting does too before so maybe that has something to do with it.
