assassinscreed,fp2sqyp,t1_fp2ly3q,1588267270.0,"OG fan here. These are my two cents.

You know that there is still a huge emphasis on stealth in the newest games right? Shit I'd argue that the best way to play both Origins and Odyssey is stealth because it has had a decade of refinement behind it. 

But the key thing people keep getting upset about is that the newer games give you an option to be loud. Which is hilarious considering that the definition of an assassin has no connotation to being stealthy. 

The funny thing is that the games also follow that definition because Assassin's creed was **never** about being completely stealth whether you want to admit it or not.

Every trailer features violence in a public place with plenty of witnesses. In every game you fight in public places, walk around in clothing while armed to the teeth which clearly indicates that you are out to kill people, and kill indescribably leaving a trail of bodies everywhere you go.

So don't try and tell me these games are purely about stealth. Being an assassin is about killing high profile targets however you choose. The only distinction between the newer and older games in that respect is that the newer games give you a clear choice as to how you kill your targets. You can be stealthy or charge in and kill everyone you see. Which lets be honest, you were going to do that anyway if you were going to go stealthy.

So I don't understand what the original fans are upset about? Are you upset that there is choice in how you kill your targets and who you kill? Or is it that the game isn't linear anymore? The gameplay we love is still there, so what gives?

My only complaints of the newer games is the decline in storytelling but I'm still enjoying these games well over ten years after I played the first one.

TL:DR

- Stealth is still in the game, its optional to those who want it.
- AC was never about being a super stealthy badass. 
- The games are still fun."
