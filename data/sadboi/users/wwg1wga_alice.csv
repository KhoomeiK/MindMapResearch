boston,flm0kis,t3_fpj1jx,1585271799.0,"cannabis companies have a lot of masks and gloves just sayin'

they don't need to be manufacturing at full capacity because they're shut down to only medical

if they had any decency they would get as many of these masks and gloves, and any sanitizers like isopropyl alcohol they could and turn them over to the hospitals

but they're not

&#x200B;

\[edit: hi yes thank you for the downvoting into oblivion, v nice v nice to see everyone coming together. Maybe i should clarify: we've got overstock. Especially of critical PPE like N95 masks, bootie shoe covers, nitrile gloves, etc that are the only thing protecting healthcare workers during this global pandemic. Using these items to produce weed instead of provide critical care like ventilator intubation is spitting in the face of all of the workers and patients in their care. If we looked around there are probably many other manufacturing industries that could do the same. If the government's not going to step up, there should be more agreements made between the state and our private industries. anyway have a nice day.\]

i personally think it's got something to do with the fact that my outlook on things is generally poor and negative- ""the world is cruel and dangerous"" type thinking, so when i see something that counters that narrative i'm so relieved and happy. i think it helps restore a little bit of faith in humanity and i welcome the tears since they're not sorrowful."

Sometimes I'll be cuddling and so relaxed, practically asleep, and something as small as my s/o shifting his arm and gripping me a little tighter can send me into an almost insane panic- i'll try to re-shift my weight, but most of the time I have to completely stop being touched for the panic and feeling like I want to flail around and/or hurt myself to go away. It sucks. I think it's called a sensory flashback- I try to remember that I'm not in the bad environment or with the abusive person anymore, I'll use grounding techniques and deep breathing. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesnt.

I have the same problem with the shower, too. I like to bring fuzzy slippers and a bathrobe into the bathroom with me and use a big beach-size bath towel so i can be as covered as possible and soft/comfy while I'm getting in and out. A lot of times i bring my change of clothes in, too, just so I'll have to be completely naked for less time.

Another thing I noticed is now I have a hard time playing around. Play-wrestling or tickle fights can be fun on occasion but more often i find myself out of breath and panicked and holding myself back from going \*SUPERSAYAN\* full fight mode because that's what my body wants to do even though my mind is trying to tell it it's just playtime.

ptsd,fcbuohh,t3_egwm93,1577591174.0,"Small ways I've overcome some of the boredom/apathy (in no particular order):

\-changing furniture around, changing wall hangings/pictures/etc semi regularly makes the same living space look & feel new

\-working seasonal jobs has helped. or two part time jobs that were completely different. seasonal work is hard to plan around sometimes but it does allow you to work for a variety of different companies and types of work, which keeps things fresh and interesting. also for me at least, knowing a job had a set end date made the shitty days easier to deal with.

\-walking/hiking is the only ""hobby"" i've managed to stick with. which isn't overly impressive but i'll sometimes listen to a podcast or music and bring a notebook or lunch and i find being outside away from people is when i'm happiest.

\-getting bored of people is trickier. everyone has their slumps, highs and lows of a relationship. if it's someone you haven't been with for long and they're already boring you or showing signs of incompatibility, i don't necessarily think it's a bad thing to break it off. if it's a year or two in, maybe you just hit a lull and need a spicy argument and makeup session or night out together to rekindle the flame. i don't know. 

what i can say regarding PTSD and relationships from my experience is that most people don't understand it. if you can find someone who even 25% understands, you're in good shape. and i've never been successful in dating someone without going to therapy simultaneously, and often bringing them along with me. having an unbiased third party there to help explain my weird PTSD reactions to things has made a world of difference in their understanding of me and my thought processes."
vegan,fc6zx78,t3_egbklr,1577493833.0,"I used to dream about the foods I was restricting myself from when I was in the middle of my eating disorder. I'd have dreams I ate chicken, cakes, ice cream, and lots and lots of anything chocolate (especially if it was that time of the month). Once I stopped restricting myself and my body was no longer underweight and malnourished, the weird feverish food dreams stopped. 

The same thing happened when I went vegan a couple years later. After about 6 months, maybe less, on the vegan diet I was having food dreams again- especially meat and dairy products, of course. I was also barely a healthy weight by that point, bordering on the line of underweight again. When I went back to eating an omnivorous diet the dreams stopped, I gained about 10-15lbs and am back to a healthy weight, and I don't really get cravings anymore because I'm not completely denying myself of them."

But the vape ban is happening for a reason- i cannot in good faith recommend that you vape any distillate products at this time because the jury is still out as far as the effects on lung tissue. The solvents, additives, and terpenes used to create the distillate oil may all be bad for you depending on things like what temperature you vape them at (the terpenes in particular can be carcinogenic depending on what kind and what temp they're vaporized at) and if there's any residual solvent (ethanol or butane) in the product. Once the vapor is in your lungs and it cools down to 98.6 degrees, the particles solidify and remain in your lungs. So be careful."
