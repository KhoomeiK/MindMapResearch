Other ways of being tired can include emotional, mental or spiritual tiredness (others might be able to suggest other types like creative tiredness). Perhaps you could investigate those options for your case?   
As you mention depression, one of the examples may be that you are constantly trying to keep it together and keep your depression from taking over and this might cause a constant (but unnoticed) drain on your energy in the background.  
As always, please do consult a doctor about serious medical questions or decisions. It might also for instance be the case that you have Mono or a Vitamin D deficiency for instance, for which you need a bloodtest to figure out.
