Well one night, when I was 6 or 7 winky somehow escaped his cage and got into dribbles, literally killed him.. and then sat in there til the morning. My dad found the body of dribbles and quickly threw him away and then... I don’t know how, my dad claims he didn’t do it even now but apparently winky got into the freezer and froze to death in there... so bang they were both dead and only my dad knew that. What did he tell my brother and I? “Oh no guys you’re hamsters got bored of being in their cages and ran away from home. Maybe they’ll be home some day soon though”. So that happened"

Our bodies, to be at a healthy amount... are supposed to be 10-20% body fat. If the average adult weighs 120-200, 30-40 lbs of fat is more than 20% of their bodies. I don’t care your feelings on the matter honestly, it’s science that it’s healthy not to be too fat... hell even having a bit of a belly can raise your chances of a heart attack. Nothing’s necessarily wrong with it, but it doesn’t appeal to most people (why would it?

dating_advice,f6d9gbe,t3_dr12q0,1572792509.0,"Well I'm guessing there's a few reasons for this and a few reasons against this. For one, if you are constantly talking throughout that time... small talk might wear thin on your actual date (making a ad first impression), they might feel like y'all are talking a lot for two people who have just met (you might annoy or bother them while they are busy going through their daily lives), and there's always the risk of misinterpretation of texts (running the risk of someone misunderstanding a text or a call making them uneasy). 

On the other hand though... it can also be the saving grace of actually having that date. Many people are more likely not to cancel if you can hold up the conversation and not make things awkward after you both have set plans. People also generally talk themselves out of it or run things through their head a million times before they make a decision and the positives of cancelling after no contact for five days or however long might not outweigh the positives of just giving someone a chance. There's a lot of possibilities when it comes to making plans, but I personally think it's up to the individual. If you think that ignoring someone for five days is going to show them anything other than they're a blow off date... I think you might have problems. Showing someone you care and enjoy talking to them is probably one of the most important aspects of setting up and following through with a date, at least in my opinion."

BreakUps,f6aswjb,t3_dqmssa,1572761966.0,"I think what sucks the most is remembering all the good times. I am dealing with the same thing and while I think it's worth noting I'm a guy, a high school guy at that, I too have struggled to move on. I actually lost more people than just my ex when we broke up. I lost my entire friend group essentially (all mutual friends, all close until the end... well other than one of them, but I try and keep her out of my thoughts as much as possible when thinking about my friends). They all kinda took my ex's side and so I was sort of ostracized and like cast out of the whole group (except one friend who really helped me immensely through all this). So I had to begin sitting by other people and trying to make new friends all over again in my senior year which was kind of weird. A lot has changed, but the more time that has gone on the more I realize that I can be happy. There's no one I'm all that close to anymore, but there's definitely new people I like and that I know I can talk to if I need to. Plus, one of the people from my old group actually apologized to me the other day which made me ecstatic since I had really missed them and been wanting to reconnect with them for a while. I just want to say that no matter what the breakup entails, you can overcome it. I really just want you to know that time does heal all wounds... no matter how much this person meant to you and no matter how much anyone means to you, there's always more people out there who will look at you the same way. There's always new lovers, friends, or just people in general to meet and talk to.  You'll be alright... I promise."
relationship_advice,f5taxnu,t3_dp91t4,1572454383.0,"It all depends on how you feel. Definitely talk to her about it in person, but if were me personally and the person was honest... I'd forgive them and try to move forward. You can't always keep going forward and sometimes have to let things die, but it really is just her being jealous of you. I don't know if it's that big of a deal (not to negate what you said) and would just throw it under the rug as a bit of drama."

relationship_advice,f5t9j8p,t3_dp927k,1572453439.0,"I think that you are being a little unreasonable with this request, they could truly see one another purely as friends and to think that he's going to betray you and run away from this girl is paranoia at it's finest. He moved in with you, he tells you that he loves you and that you're his priority... has he actually done anything that might tell you otherwise? It really sounds like they're purely friends and just because they've done things together before and how he wanted to be with her **before,** you're looking at it as a ""one true love"" situation. I understand why you'd be a little uneasy about it, but I also think you're really reading too much into it. Trust is essential to relationships and I would say trust them until they give you a reason not to."
relationship_advice,f5t8nbs,t3_dp92by,1572452873.0,"Probably end it... if she's uncomfortable with the idea of being with you it really doesn't seem like something that could even be stable. Not to be an asshole, but probably letting her go and finding someone else would be better. She clearly is hesitant to be with you so... my advice would be to let her go and move on.

Edit: missed an important detail, adjusted it though."

love,f3labhf,t3_dh6rqs,1570974046.0,"Love is such a tricky emotion and honestly, I feel like I'm just now realizing all the components there are to loving someone else. Pain, understanding, and growth from your experiences are essential to keep moving forward. Being stuck on someone isn't doing anything for you or them... so to say you're afraid you'll never love again is to say that you're still stuck on someone else. A conscious effort to remember what was wrong and work to better yourself is the only path forward. Don't forget what's behind you, don't ignore what's around you, and don't think that there's nothing ahead of you. That's my philosophy and faith for the future."
