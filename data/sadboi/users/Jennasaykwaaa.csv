muacjdiscussion,fiol7mw,t3_f8yi27,1582585419.0,"Used many but the tried and true for me are the Maybelline color tattoos in barely branded if you can find it , or in their newly released shades just pick something similar.
 Apply to your whole lid and above with a flat brush. does not affect matte shadows you may want under the brow, and my eye shadow wears all day and beyond. (And I work 12-13 hour shifts at the hospital ... sweating sometimes under isolation gowns etc. ) There is no creasing after a shift, nothing.  It’s just amazing. Side note: I go ahead and apply my shadow with the same brush I used for the paint pot. No problem causing hard pan or anything like that. Now I do use a different brush for my matte cream highlight shade under the brow but that’s Bc I do not want the solid shadow to contaminate my brow shade. 

I also like Mac paint pots but I won’t repurchase. Costs too much more and just a little thicker. There seriously is nothing better than a color tattoo. You get at least a years use out of a container.



Also I suggest a lighter color only Bc anything can go over it. But they do have some dark colors that would be nice for a dark smoky eyeshadow look. But the must have is a light shade."
