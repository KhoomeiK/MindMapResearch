unpopularopinion,fn72pa5,t3_fzys5w,1586712135.0,"When I was your age, I never even considered dating to be a priority because I was invested in school and generally speaking, no guy ever looked my way. I'm turning 21 soon and dating as a teenager versus dating in your adult years takes on a new form. I never dated anyone until I was 19 and 20 and even now, guys who come to me just simply want a hookup out of boredom, holed up over an ex, or fear of attachment. I have been in two relationships thus far and the people I dated had the mentality of someone who lived in a fantasy world. Not to say I am mature or know what I'm doing but I know what I want for myself not just short term but long term as well and many of these people who go on flings are simply just still in the process of growing up. For some, they may very much so just enjoy sex or use it as a coping mechanism. Dating around lets you get a feel for what you want/find attractive or just to garner more experience. No one should be shunned for their preferences, as long as they are not harming others.  


I never had any form of true sexual intimacy with my exes because both showed me bad signs so I'm glad I never gave myself to either of them. Don't get me wrong, the temptation to engage in hookup culture is absolutely unreal, especially with heartbreak and losing hope in others but if you know hookup culture isn't for you, try to stay away. But either way, other people's decisions to engage in hookups/open relationships/casual relationships should be respected because maintaining a relationship is **DIFFICULT**. It is not a fairytale of sorts. And even if you're with someone for a long time, it is reasonable to understand that yes, they will still find others attractive and whatnot. The relationship may stagnate at times, insecurities flare up, different goals, etc., but it takes two to make the bond remain strong.

I don't want to know what the looming generations will have to experience. I can only hope."
BPD,fn4427r,t1_fn2feeq,1586633632.0,"Wow, I can totally see this. I think both of my past exes subconsciously seeked me out for this reason and it doesn‚Äôt feel nice to know I was only an ego boost for them."

BPD,fn0q5hb,t1_fn0nd41,1586546632.0,"I understand. I was in two relationships in the past. Both weren‚Äôt that great and my issues just made some things worse.

I hope they find people who aren‚Äôt like me and find happiness but remember, we‚Äôre never ‚Äútoo much‚Äù for the right folks. If they can‚Äôt handle you at your worst, you can."
BPD,fn09ws7,t3_fyh7we,1586538077.0,"I can sort of relate to this...I'm bitter towards myself because I have a desire to feel more intimate with others but my trust issues and fear of commitment ruin it. Well, I seem to always refer to past experiences when forming new friendships or relationships. I tell myself that if I notice any ""patterns"" to break off the bond but sometimes I am the one who causes these patterns in the first place. I have strong urges to run away whenever people try getting close to me and it's not that I want to but rather it scares me to death so I hold many at arm's distance...the ""porcupine's dilemma"" in essence.    


I really don't know and understand what true, healthy communication is. I go through cycles of wanting validation but become intensely disgusted by any form of affection or attention. It drives me insane with this back and forth thing in my head. At this point, love seems pointless and I think I'd rather enjoy the casual companionship of someone without any romantic attachment. It's extremely painful seeing others happy. Maybe one day...who knows.   


But keep in mind, at the end of the day social media is mostly all show and no tell. We all try to post what we deem as acceptable in the eyes of others so don't feel so caught up with it. And besides, it's healthier to stay off social media as much as you can."

Anxiety,fmrju5s,t3_fwm9rl,1586325407.0,"Dude, my friends literally blew my mind when they told me that they rarely ever ruminated over past stuff. I used to dwell on a lot of stuff back then before I started therapy and the difference between now and then is absolutely mind-blowing. I sometimes wonder what and how a normal, non-anxious person thinks like lol."
BPD,fmrj9i9,t3_fwy9gb,1586324894.0," Yeah, and the more distance I create, the more sadness and self-hatred I internalize. It's really all just self-sabotage. I do think it's sad though...sometimes I just sit in silence and cry in frustration. I wonder what a normal person would do instead. When I sense myself distancing to avoid abandonment, I usually begin to ""split"" in the process. I have no sense of actual stability in my self-identity so I resort to changing myself whether that be big or small like hopping around to different music tastes, clothes, hair, interests, etc., to ""delete"" the version of myself that is being ""abandoned."" My interests and ways of self-expression usually clash so often times it makes me feel more lost. I'd rather have someone completely forget me/be unrecognizable than to be remembered if I leave their life, or if they leave me.  
I believe this is probably why I also do not rely on anyone for any type of emotional/mental support besides my therapist/counselors. I'm used to people coming in and out of my life but at least now I always try to take both positive and negative lessons from these experiences.  


Just typing this out makes me realize how these actions can impact us. I do find it both fascinating and weird how our brains can interpret ""abandonment"" due to our attachment styles, traumas, views, etc."
OSHA,fmm2s3s,t1_fmkcc13,1586197719.0,I‚Äôll be 6ft closer to this man after Miss Rona leaves thank you very much
BPD,flxtt6u,t3_fruyeq,1585589698.0,"You need to ask yourself, do you truly still feel for him or are you just afraid of detaching yourself from him? Considering he was narcissist, you may have only truly bonded with him through trauma. Trauma bonding is unfortunately incredibly powerful. It is addicting in an unhealthy way. Narcissists have a way of placing people on a pedestal and then once they leave, they rip the stool under you and leave you hurt. 

Do you want to stay in that spot, the one you are in now, forever? I don‚Äôt mean to come off harsh but knowing myself, my BPD causes me to have irrational thoughts that seem to overpower logic most of the time. We act out and regress through these actions. Impulsivity is difficult to control but we can do it. I think you need to sit back and actually reflect on the relationship. It‚Äôs over for a reason, or in fact, many reasons. 

It will not be easy to recover but it is doable. Find your strength to overcome the feelings you are trying to avoid. Consider this...there are more people out there. Be excited! New opportunities means new experiences. Growth requires being uncomfortable sometimes and that‚Äôs okay, if it benefits you. Instead of checking her social media, try something new for yourself. It may be daunting at first but it is a new opportunity for yourself. 

Everyone copes differently. Try to find ways to do it healthily. Find yourself as they say but don‚Äôt be discouraged if you don‚Äôt see results immediately. It will take time. How long? Who knows but you will see results. You‚Äôll be surprised how much power you possess over yourself with time.

All the best."
