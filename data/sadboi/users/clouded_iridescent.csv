relationships,fkju2s2,t1_fkjtrdx,1584259702.0,"...that’s so well said. Thank you for pointing that out. Our feelings don’t give us an excuse all the time for our actions. I say so many things I don’t mean when I’m mad...I have to take responsibility. Your comment wasn’t harsh, it was just the truth. And I need to wake up and see that, before this toxic behavior controls all of me and affects everyone I love."
relationships,fkjtrtu,t1_fkjtact,1584259310.0,Currently doing that right now. I guess it really does take baby steps to change...
relationships,fkjtqtp,t1_fkjtb1s,1584259273.0,"No, I understand. I thank you so much for your honesty. To be fair, I expected any of the advice given could be easier said than done but it’s just being honest. I need to work for it, and everything has a price. I am currently seeking counseling right now, so that’s already one step for change. While your ways hurt, I do believe that those are the choices as well if I keep going down this path. It’s definitely a wake up call. I believe communication is a huge key in keeping relationships together...so yes, I absolutely have to tell him what I’m going to do. Running away and distancing myself won’t do any good.

Thank you so much for the advice."

MeetPeople,etxskd4,t1_etwhbd6,1563306430.0,"You’re fine! :) I know what you mean and I appreciate this advice. I think for me currently, my family is just defined as the friends or people in general that provide me a good support system. In a way, I like the idea of having something to help stabilize me, but at the same time, i feel like I still want to pursue to having stress in my life because it is the one key that helps keep me motivated."

MeetPeople,etxrxrx,t1_etwx388,1563306032.0,True!!! For some reason it’s always a bit scary to introduce yourself to new people...even if you do like to interact with others. It just happens.

CasualConversation,equa9gt,t3_bznney,1560326881.0,"I was just in the same position as you last year. 
First off—congrats on graduating! You made it! Give yourself some credit
— secondly, I understand your fear of entering college and not knowing what if this is 100% you want to do with your life. Just know, that it’s completely normal. You can’t always plan your future with such specific details. The one thing you’re going to notice as you transition from high school to college, is that you won’t be alone starting this new chapter. There are tons of people in the same boat as you. Just remember you’re taking this big step, so it’s ok to have these “what if..” thoughts. 
Honestly....just go with the flow. Do your best, and pursue what you love. You’re going to gain so much independence and responsibility in your first year, so it’s ok to feel a little worried. But just know, that whatever happens, you will be ok. 

Congrats again for graduating! Best wishes :)"

AskWomen,epvmqj3,t3_bw40in,1559540212.0,Ignorance—or just in general not willing to open to difference perspectives.
AskWomen,epvmmze,t3_bw72tv,1559540093.0,"The closest friends I have now were the people I met at the most random times. One friend was gained when we bonded over our love for a condiment at a restaurant, another friend was gained because I accidentally walked into her dorm (she was the door next to mine) and we ended up have a great conversation, and another time is where I saw this girl stressing out over an essay and I asked if she was ok. She ended up completing her work, and to cheer her up, we treated ourselves to binge eating and getting to know each other more."
AskWomen,epvmd40,t3_bw436k,1559539763.0,"I overthink EVERYTHING. I’m trying to get better, but things just take time. I feel like because I care so much...it cuts me off from a lot of opportunities that I would want to experience with in the world. I focus a lot on the perspectives of other people, rather than mine. It’s nice to care, but I also need to care for myself. Problem is, I just don’t know how to. It’s annoying too because even if I’m aware of overthinking something, I still proceed to go down that route of endless unnecessary thoughts that just build up."
