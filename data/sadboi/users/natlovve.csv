It’s hard to hold on at times but having an accountability partner helps, it also helps me to know if I ever got that reckless it would be over for me but the people who love me, they’d be left in the sadness I was living in, maybe for the rest of their lives. I truly would never want anyone to feel the sadness and loneliness I go thru.  I try to remember, I know this spiral , I know the waves, I also know they will end. I’m thankful when the fog clears in my brain and I get to finally see the beauty, it’s a beautiful sadness bc I’m so glad I didn’t give up. Stay strong. Know you are loved."
