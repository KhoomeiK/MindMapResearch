mentalillness,fqby6o5,t3_ghkdrc,1589246265.0,"I just finished the first phase of the investigation (it has taken two years) to have mine charged.  The only thing that gave me courage to keep pushing forward was the evidence of FIVE other women filing reports over a seven year period with no charges filed.  I got to the point I realized he had destroyed me... so no more damage can be done.  But I may be able to stop him from hurting more women.  When I read the reports and saw the others using the exact same words to describe what he did I was sickened beyond anything. 

I can only offer you encouragement.  It’s hell and nobody should experience this."
BorderlinePDisorder,fq0d9yl,t1_fpy0dcw,1589030292.0,"I’m 46 and feel like I am crawling through the muddy floor of rock bottom’s basement... because I am. I have tried “starting over” so many times that I don’t have connections to anyone from my life except my mom and one sibling that don’t believe that BPD is real.  They just believe I choose to be a crappy person and have a very long and precise scorecard of everything I have done to end up in this place. 
I spent over a month inpatient in December and managed to find someone to let me sleep in their basement for a bit at the first of the year because I had two surgeries scheduled.  Was working with a therapist and social worker to find housing when Covid shutdowns started. Now I have no support and no where to live. 
I wake up throughout the night and in the morning with panic attacks and sadness because I am realizing that I am not going to come out on the other side and my failed life is almost over.  It’s the worst sadness ever.  I hear you."

It eased some of my physical anxiety symptoms (jitters and headaches), but I faced a lot of paranoia on it.  That’s why I decided it just wasn’t worth it.  I knew it was trading one set of symptoms for another. 
I also agree with being dependent by staying with someone just to avoid being alone.... my problems came when I cut ties with EVERYONE. I don’t know what the balance is. 
I hope you find some peace.  ♥️"
relationship_advice,fp77mw9,t1_fp6to7e,1588365526.0,"I started anxiety medication when I was 26.  It felt like a lifesaver to me after always struggling with crippling anxiety.  At 36 a doctor decided that he would rapid taper me off.  My anxiety skyrocketed.  I ended up losing everything in my life and being a dark shell of a person.  In less than a year I lost my four bedroom Victorian home, three kids and job.  I ended up in a one bedroom apartment with a tv and air mattress.  
About a year and a half later a new prescriber started me back on (switched from Xanax to Klonipin).  I built my life back up to about 1/3 what it used to be.  I was “somewhat” stable for a few more years. A year ago another provider decided to slow taper me off.  I somewhat hung on until six months later I was rapidly tapered to one .5mg tablet at night.  I am now jobless, homeless and totally alone.  Nobody can tolerate the mess I am.  I have taken an extra pill three times during the day, smoked one joint and drank beer one day.  
I felt dramatically better those days.  I felt like I could breath for a little while.  I wasn’t trapped in my head with thoughts racing about the end of my life. 
Now I am left wondering if life would be better if I was medicated for anxiety or if I would just be going back to start another crash. 
I didn’t give you any advice.  I don’t know what I would do if I were in your shoes.  In my heart I feel like if someone loved me enough to stick with me and support me through my anxiety I would not use medication, but I also know people loathe my anxiety meltdowns more than me being kinda spacey. 
Good luck.  Please remember that you don’t have to suffer to please someone else, but being absolutely alone on this earth is the most painful life one can live."
