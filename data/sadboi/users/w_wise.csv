It doesn't seem healthy or reasonable to burn bridges just because your friends don't see eye to eye with you on certain interests. Unless it's at the point where you being a furry negatively impacts the way they treat you, I can't really get behind the idea of dismissing the entirety of a friendship over a single interest.

Also, might want to consider the fact that some friends ""hate on"" furries because you don't tell them you are one. If there's no one in your group that's part of this interest, it's free game to make fun of it. It's classic in-group vs out-group behavior, and furries are the easiest to dunk on (and it doesn't help that furries are starting to get more mainstream so they're on people's minds more)."

Warframe,fl14dep,t1_fl0gbry,1584721774.0,">Yeah! I really love this too. I think the problem with grinding is people that spend too much on game. If you have something awful to grind (like Condition Overload) just take it easy, do the mission twice every week, repeat the mission in different ways (I'm in love with Titania, fe). And then play another game. This game is, in my opinion, the best F2P game atm. Toxic community is just a myth in this game. Also, play another month and then watch the video ""100 days on Warframe"". You will laugh a lot.

I never really got the ""Warframe is really grindy"" part. Yes, I'm aware there is a grind, but are people saying it's very grindy relative to other games like it or in general, across all games? 

Maybe it's because I came from an MMO to Warframe but Warframe's grind doesn't even come close to an MMO level, so I never really got the ""too grindy"" argument."

Inventory slot +1 costs 1k, which is 10 days of login, and weight +50 costs 3.5k (and limited 4 purchases). So that means it'll take you 140 days just to get 200 LT (and no more after that), and even if you logged in for a year straight, you'd only be able to buy 36 inventory slots. For one character. Assuming you don't spend a single loyalty point elsewhere.

blackdesertonline,fioeyeg,t1_fio1s8v,1582581935.0,"You don't see gear in the cash shop because the progression system in BDO is set up so that selling ""attempts"" (through crons from costume melting) is far more profitable than just flat out selling PEN gear. 

With the enhancement rates being pathetically low, PA would have to price PEN gear at something ridiculously high to match the profits they would've made on average from selling costumes for a PEN success. PA probably knows that because of consumer psychology, people are far more willing to spend when the items are lower priced (i.e. a costume), even if they ended up spending exactly the same amount if PA had just listed one PEN gear for a very high price. Not to mention that lower prices gives consumers a lower barrier of entry so they can potentially throw in one or two attempts (and not even get PEN).

Even if you're not buying costumes/value packs to use for yourself, then you can just consider buying costumes as straight up buying silver from the pearl shop. Even if you consider that ""return"" to be terrible, it's undeniable that over the years, they have essentially just boosted the value of your pearl purchases through the silver value increases for the same amount of money that you spend. Costumes used to be 37m for a Premium one, and now they're almost 10x higher, all for the same price of 3400 pearls. 

Unless you're trying to argue for some nuance like BDO is just ""pay to lose"", BDO is most certainly a game where spending money gives you a significant edge over non-paying players, and that's not even getting into the other things that can't even be sold on the market/achieved in-game (meaning the only way to get it is to spend money)."

I know it is irrational and selfish to expect someone to devote as much of their life to you as you do to them, but I can't help  feeling morose about it.

I think it all just relates back to a fear of abandonment. Not knowing where you stand compared to the other friends.

worldnews,fezb7ag,t1_fexxtr3,1579455603.0,"I've been playing Warframe for the last few months and I have to say, of all the games I've played so far, their microtransaction strategies are by far the least offensive.

Warframe is arguably very p2w (you can pretty much buy almost everything with enough premium currency/money) which I believe they advertise as paying for time, for people who don't have all the time in the world to grind for stuff. But I never found it to have diminished the actual gameplay at its core. You can very easily earn almost everything they sell by simply just playing the game enough. And in some ways, the prices for some things you can buy (basic resources) are so high that it is clearly better to grind for it than purchase it. Warframe also has a lootbox for sale (relic packs), but it's also purchasable with in-game currency as well.

Compared to the other two games I've played, Black Desert Online and Mabinogi, Warframe manages to have a lucrative strategy while hardly diminishing their own gameplay (i.e. when it becomes better to pay than it does to play). Recently they sold an item that would bypass a repair for an item (including repair time and resource cost), but quickly rescinded it and apologized after the feedback it had gotten. And then made it an in-game drop. As far as I have seen, Warframe handles their microtransactions really well.

Compare to Black Desert Online, where you can't go like a few days without a post on their subreddit or forums about the company's (Pearl Abyss) scummy marketing tactics. Black Desert Online has had quite a lot of controversy over their microtransactions over their game life. And they recently begun selling lootboxes (big yikes). 

How BDO differs from Warframe in my opinion is that their premium shop offers many things that you simply cannot get in-game. Or they offer in-game equivalents that are so impractical to use, you'd be better off just going for their premium version. A few examples would be: 1) their swimming outfits; normally you swim at a really really slow pace. Pay $22, suddenly you swim really fast. There's no way you can acquire this item in game. 2) A $50 multipurpose tent that has a lot of useful functions, mostly geared towards helping you grind (remote repair, remote small store, remote small storage, buy buffs remotely). There is an in-game equivalent, but it requires a ridiculous amount of upkeep to use (you have to rent the store weekly, repair the repair anvil daily etc.) that practically no one uses because it would negate most of the grinding income. There's a lot more examples, but the point is that BDO gets a lot of comments about having scummy marketing tactics because they create situations in which you're almost compelled to purchase their (very expensive digital) products or suffer.

Mabinogi has a different problem altogether. It's a Nexon game, and if you've played Maplestory, you know about gachapon (basically lootbox). Mabinogi's lootboxing is so egregious that the game economy is practically built on top of it. How that came to be, you ask? Because the lootboxes are basically the ""content"". They basically started putting gear in there that is so much better the actual gear you can acquire in-game, that there practically is no point to grinding for normal gear. And many other goodies. All un-acquireable from normal gameplay. The game is old so it honestly can't keep up with the games of the current times. So it seems like the company has decided to cash in as much as they can before it completely dies by selling as much lootboxes as possible. And how do they do this? Because lootboxes are offering all the actual ""content"".

So from these three games, my point would be: definitely avoid a Mabinogi situation, where lootboxing in game is not just a bonus, or even for fun, but part of the core gameplay. Between BDO and Warframe it gets a bit more nuanced, because on the basic level, their cash shop offers similar things (exp boosters, etc). But where BDO does it wrong is they make it practically a necessity to buy their items, while Warframe, as they advertise, is just paying for time, but is more or less a luxury (and they give methods to acquire it in-game as well).

Tl;dr I like Warframe, BDO sucks, Mabinogi would've been good if they didn't p2w so much"
