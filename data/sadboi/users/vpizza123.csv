Its doubtful it was his idea to go to twin peaks, if his friends suggested it and the others were on board he may have felt awkward or lame saying no, doesnt mean he couldn't have told you though.

relationship_advice,fefpou4,t1_fefoy6t,1579061706.0,Initially I called right after it happened while I was waiting for my parents and for the cops. I was so scared and just wanted to be confronted but he just kept asking random questions about my car when what I needed was literally just love and support. So I told him I'd call later. He texted me letting me know he was here whenever I was ready to call back. I call back after everything including me is more relaxed...and again hes just asking about my car or being silent...it was awkward. I was sad and scared and just needed to be cared for for like 1 minute. I felt myself getting disappointed so I said I was getting off the phone and hung up. He texted me like 3O minutes later apologizing for not comforting me the way I needed. He seemed sincere and told me to tell him how he can be more helpful next time. Which I know is really nice but I'm still really disappointed and upset and worried about his support in the future.
