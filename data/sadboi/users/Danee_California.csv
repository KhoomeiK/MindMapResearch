You currently  have a cash balance of $275 and clipper cards can only hold a maximum cash value of $300 (which is separate from BART HVD tickets). Once the balance gets low enough to load each respective $200 amount, it should load on to the card at a contactless terminal."
LatinoPeopleTwitter,fmh45vt,t1_fmgsgbf,1586066165.0,"I resonate with this. Both of my parents are fluent Spanish speakers but didn't have the patience to teach me and also didn't want me to suffer the discrimination they did. 

I'm trying to learn now, especially because I have a lot of family in Mexico I'd love to connect with better. But when I try to practice with other people, they have shamed me, called me stupid, given me dirty looks, or completely ignored me. It gives me a lot of anxiety, I feel embarrassed and shame and makes it difficult to keep trying to learn. How did you find compassionate teachers?"
Anxiety,flyjylu,t1_flyiffl,1585603565.0,"Seconded. I'm super hypervigilant (thanks anxiety and trauma) so I read into every text, sigh, or eye movement and think that I'm just a bother or annoying and that people are irritated or angry with me. And that makes me be more avoidant, especially in times like these.

I just have to ask for reassurance every once in awhile and keep reminding myself that these people in my life love me and like my presence and to accept that."

**Vaginal Hygiene and Other Bodily Stuff:** 

* Firstly, while if you don't feel comfortable using correct terminology to describe your vagina, you should know what the different terms are for the different areas of your lady parts so identify where issues are happening if you are having health problems with your vulva. I would recommend seeking out a sexual health resource, such as Planned Parenthood, but generally; The whole area is called your vulva, the inside portion is your vagina, right above your vaginal opening is the urethra, the smaller folds are called inner labia, and the little nub covered by another fold(s) is your clitoris.
* When it comes to washing your vulva, you absolutely do not need to use any specialized soap products. Society has made it so we feel bad about vulvas smelling like, well, vulvas, but there's nothing wrong with that! As others have said, a little soap and water is fine (I personally go for baby soap or unscented soap) - use this to clean your inner labia and all the other nooks and crannies, and make sure to rinse well to prevent irritation. Absolutely under no circumstances put soap in your vagina! This disrupts the ph level, and your vagina is self-cleaning; douching or putting soap up your vagina can give you yeast infections or really throw your smell out of wack.
* Periods. They are the WORST. You can use tampons, pads, cups, whatever you'd like, but remember for pads and tampons to change them at least every 8 hours. Always go with the lowest absorbency you can take. When putting tampons in, remember to relax and stick it in all the way.  Cups need to be emptied at least every 12 hours.
* Speaking of things that come out of our vulva, discharge. That is usually a whiteish substance that comes from the vagina being self-cleaning. Sometimes, due to the ph, it can bleach your panties; very normal. What is not normal is if it smells fishy, or is yellowish or greenish in hue - if this happens, please go to the doctor.
* Bodies. They come in all shapes and sizes, and it's normal to have uneven breasts. Normal to have large or small nipples, large or small labia, long clitorises, etc., so don't worry about what you look like and if it's normal! Chances are, it is.

**Sex and Sexual Health:**

* Again, one of those things where seeking out a good resource like Planned Parenthood would be good.
* Not sure what your questions are but bascially, if you having sex with a new person always use a condom! This greatly lowers your risk of being able to contract and STD or become pregnant. And even if someone says they are ""clean"", the most common symptom of an STD is no symptom. Better safe that sorry!
* Consent is extremely important - if you are not giving an enthusiastic yes, then it's a no. You can say no at any point, even in the middle of sex, that is your right.
* The clitoris is your best friend when it comes to giving yourself pleasure. Get to know what you like and what feels good - there is nothing wrong with seeking pleasure and asking for it!
* Remember to pee after sex! This helps to prevent getting a UTI. 
* Guys(or girls, enbies, or whomever your doing the deed with) are generally just happy to be being intimate with you. Don't worry about what you look like or what you're doing, sex is supposed to be fun! And if you're worried about pleasing your partner, just ask. It may feel uncomfortable, but communication is key.

**Make-up, Clothing, etc:**

* As other folks have said, there is no right or wrong way to be a woman. Society likes to put this standard on woman of what we should look like, but fuck that, we dress and act how we want and guess what? Still women! 
* If make-up is something you're interested in, the sky is the limit. You can do really simple stuff or go all out - as others have suggested, a good place to start would be Youtube or even your local make-up store like Ulta or Sephora. Don't be disappointed if you have a certain look in mind and it doesn't come out exactly how you wanted, it takes practice!
* Clothing, well, also up to you, sky is the limit! There are tons of blogs and whatnot out there that will give you style tips, etc., Ultimately, it's about dressing in a way that makes you feel good about yourself. Whatever that looks like is up to you.
* When it comes to grooming yourself, as others have said, brush your hair and put on deodorant daily (although I'd be lying if I said I don't brush my hair every day, oops). Showering daily is best, and applying lotion right after helps to keep your skin soft.
* On the topic of skin and skincare, also good to wash your face daily, or even twice a day. Apply moisturizer and sunscreen as well. Changing out your pillowcase frequently helps with acne. 

That's all I got. Again, feel free to PM me if you have any other questions!"

 It's rough and feels bad, but you're more than just your score. Give yourself some credit and be kind to yourself! This is a tough test and you did the best you could. I'm sure you're capable and smart and will achieve what you want - just gotta keep moving onward and forward."

Fun fact, this is also located next to a church (there's a joke here but I don't have one)"
