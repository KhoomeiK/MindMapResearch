It’s horrible to think about your age and weather your too old or young for anything. Think of things day by day and try not to think about your age that much in a negative way. Wake up everyday and try to bring it on with a positive attitude and do the most with the cards your dealt.

Don’t let it lead you to be filled with apathy and despair, there is hope for all of us, it is a wicked world, but we make our own world within this one and we make our life whatever we want it to be unless you plan on overthrowing the whole system singlehandedly then the information is pretty irrelevant and it will only cause you to go crazy.
