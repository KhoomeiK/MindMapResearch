I understand this feeling! It honestly took a lot of willpower to successfully curve my curiosity and it was something I had to actively work on.

To add, I admire the fact you're recognizing these things at 14!

For me, relapsing was a big part of the process of quitting. It made me feel ""better"" in the moment, but then I'd feel twice as bad afterwards. It served as further motivation for quitting, since losing the progress I had made just felt SO shitty on top of whatever was bothering me.
I still occasionally hit my thighs and scratch myself on really bad days, but I haven't cut or burned for a long time now! 

I always really feared telling my boyfriend I relapsed, but we live together and he would find out regardless. Being upfront and telling him and then talking through it felt SO much better than the shame I felt being ""caught"". 

I would just express yourself genuinely to her, especially since she's going to find out anyways. And if she relapses, she may try to hide it from you if you hide it from her. I would be sure to include the difficulty you feel in telling her because of your shame and your fear that she may relapse herself. I would also try to encourage her to contact you if she does have an urge, let her know you want to be there for her and help her beat this.

I really hope she reacts in a supporting manner and doesn't see this as a one-time allowance or something. I imagine that would just deepen the emotions you are feeling about the situation and your loss of progress.
