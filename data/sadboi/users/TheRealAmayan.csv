unpopularopinion,fgf4te2,t3_ey1ipr,1580724465.0,"I was honestly thinking about how we need a platform for all. Like there's no where where I can be a webcam model, game and art streamer. Like that would be sick IMHO."
deadbydaylight,fgf4l7m,t3_ey2bx3,1580724107.0,"I've been playing legion a bit more lately, and I for some reason get so giddy whenever I use feral frenzy. I go nyoooom and try to bop everyone for a 4-man wombo combo. Annoyed there's not an achievement for that, but it might not be as impressive as I thought it was."
deadbydaylight,fgde2av,t1_fgcv4m2,1580681465.0,"Yeah, honestly despite what stupid shit either side is doing, always try to be the better person and not give in. The other party wants a reaction out of you, and by t-bagging or anything else silly you're feeding into that. You're letting them win. This logic can honestly apply to a whole slew of things though."
OSDD,fgdd6l0,t1_fgd5630,1580681260.0,"I actually watched that video earlier today, it made me feel somewhat better about my situation. I am also planning on trying to get a therapist either in late March or April. I have a psychiatrist appointment late March, hopefully they can help and maybe suggest a good therapist. But thank you very much for the kind words. I also wish you luck."
OSDD,fgd1o3e,t3_exuiwz,1580678188.0,"I'm undiagnosed, but when I was younger some people thought I had DID because I talked about an imaginary friend who kept me company while I was going through the worst period I can remember during adolescence. Ever since then I was curious about DID and dissociative disorders. Once I started dating someone with DID, I ended up looking into it more for supportive reasons, then I started looking to my own things more which I had never really done as I was always paranoid about mental health help. I started hearing voices, dissociating more and as of recent doing bizarre shit passively. I thought I'd have more control over it since I was so...I guess familiar and welcoming to my parts, but since I started doing weird things out of the ordinary, it's been a bit scary. Like a part of me thinks one part is trying to mess with me, but I'm sure that isn't the case. Odd things have also been triggering me lately that never have, like certain music and art pieces. I've switched maybe once or twice to my knowledge. I don't really experience headaches, but I get a flash of anxiety or if the pain I'm feeling at the time is too much it just clicks. I keep thinking because I don't have a lot of communication or headaches really, I'm probably faking. Sorry for rambly response."
BPD,fgcoc6h,t1_fgciqvh,1580674696.0,That's really unfortunate.
BPD,fgcb4rc,t3_exolvw,1580670952.0,"I had a cousin tell me something similar at a thanksgiving dinner we hosted at our home once. My dad swears up and down that it was some bs my mom made up to get custody when they went through their first divorce. My mom claims it's something my aunt made up. Long story short, I don't really trust either parent 90% of the time now and probably have a lot of unknown trauma because of how fucked and confusing my childhood was."

Twitch,fg4aytq,t1_fg493xz,1580499902.0,"I wondered about that, they'd have a lot of an easier time and less getting bashed for manipulating stupid people on a platform not designed for webcam models. But I also wondered...what if there was a Twitch/Chaturbate hybrid platform. You'd be filling two niches. Like a part of me thinks some of these girls actually want to play games on stream. Their sex appeal is just an addition. Or at least that's what I've wanted to do for awhile. I have a lot of hobbies that I wish I could just mash together, but very few platforms allow that."
