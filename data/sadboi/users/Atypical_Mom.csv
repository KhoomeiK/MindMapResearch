We both like crafts, and try different things together and ask each other for tips and tricks when the other sister is “better” at that particular craft than the other. OP’s sister is probably venting, and I agree that OP explaining that she doesn’t want her hurt and it being something they do together can help (my sister, whose younger, always says that’s I’m the one who got her into it or showed her all she knows when it comes to crafts that she executes better than me)

For example, there seems to be a strong view that you do believe in god or you don’t, you can’t be in the middle and to be honest I feel like I am, mostly because I don’t really care if their is one either way (in that, I don’t think I would change my behaviors based on whether I think their is or isn’t a god). I also have read several people talk about their personal spirituality and how it ties to agnosticism and I don’t have that.

I would recommend that you ask your daughter what she is expecting and why?  What impact will this have on her new marriage and why is it so important?  Everyone’s wedding is different, but as my SO and I were still in collage and did not expect parents to pay for it, we went very low key and inexpensive. Now nearly 13 years later, I don’t regret it one bit - we married with almost no related debt and of our family and friends who had larger weddings, they have since either divorced or you only see the same picture from their wedding once a year when they update their profile picture.

There appears to be no complaints about the quality of time spent, or the activities done together - It’s just about the financial value and nothing more, and that is why they are wrong. 

Can you imagine how she would act if her ex had married a well off doctor and you asked her to tell him to curb his family trips because your children were jealous?  She’s not doing any good for your step children by making them believe that they can ask others to change their lives because they can not also participate (I mean, your daughter got an internship because of her grandfather’s connections - are they going to ask him to stop knowing people too?!?)

You’re doing the best you can, and sometimes life will feel unbalanced like this, but as others have pointed out - your step children have both their parents so perhaps they (and their mother) should focus more on what they *do* have and less on what they don’t."

She’s had a best friend since she was 2 (who is a boy) that she has always said she will marry, but everything else in her life is boys stuff (they almost had a falling out a few years back when he said she had to be Owlette from PJ Masks cause she’s a girl and she said nope, I’m always Catboy and that’s not changing today!). I just want her to be a happy, well adjusted adult who can support herself and be a good person, and however she looks or whoever she loves while doing that doesn’t matter if it supports her being a good person."
gatesopencomeonin,fjnkjsc,t1_fjnbvq7,1583509352.0,"My youngest is like this (even asked for a boy’s haircut and until recently only liked what she viewed as boy things). I’m happy to see things like this (and your comment) because I’m actively trying to be like this guy and just help her express herself and let her enjoy the things she likes - there’s so much meanness in the world, the least I can do is help her become comfortable in what she is and what she likes before those around her try to make her question it or change."

politics,fjku8fz,t1_fjhoft7,1583433999.0,"When you first got there you had to state which party you were voting for and then sign a statement on a tablet that you understood that you could not vote in the other party’s primary that year. The slip of paper I got had the party affiliation on it and from there they had two different queues that lead to where you got the ballot and then to the machines. I only had to wait about 20 minutes which wasn’t bad, I just don’t know why it was separated instead of just letting the next voter go to the next open machine."
politics,fjhdo4n,t1_fjgsctf,1583346114.0,"  Yeah, we were given the number and then the ballot and told to wait in line for a group of 4 machines.  They had an official even standing at the front of the line to let you know when you could move to an empty booth - she was the one who told me that she didn’t know why it was set up the way it was (with republican voters having twice as many booths). All kinds of odd."

It has nothing to do with you pretty boy, your just a blur in my sleep deprived, middle aged peripheral vision.  Get out of my way before I make you with my case of diapers."

AmItheAsshole,fi76t3d,t3_f6jot2,1582215475.0,"NTA  At the end of the day, while you had VERY valid reasons to not like it, a gift is about the person being gifted - NOT the gifter. 
Anytime someone wants to complain about how the gifter is feeling slighted because their gift wasn’t appreciated, those people don’t understand gift giving and that is the real issue here. Gifts are given to benefit someone else and should not be given with other motives, and to do so only makes the gifter look bad (I mean you still used it for goodness sake!  You just altered it to make it your own)."

ChoosingBeggars,fgpb2et,t1_fgo522l,1581001103.0,"So happy to see this posted - OP was absolutely professional and I was happy to see that they pushed back against her attempt to get freebies by insinuating that they were lesser (young, a minority, perhaps newer in the their business).  I don’t get how people don’t seem to understand that things only have the value we agree they have - if you don’t think it’s worth $50, then move along. But she had the gall to say it’s not worth that, but my exposure is?!?!  And then insults OP _again_ but finishes up with ‘contact me when you’ve grown up’ because she still wants the product.... i don’t know how she’s gotten this far in life and still thinks you can treat people this way. Keep up the good work OP, you’re clearly the one setting the better example (and I hope I can raise my kids to handle situations like this the way you did)."
