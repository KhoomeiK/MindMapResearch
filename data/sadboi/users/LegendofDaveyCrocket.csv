MadeMeSmile,fpxxu7s,t1_fpwxb7a,1588991808.0,"It is a bit sad, but it‚Äôs not a lost cause. I have made it a point to learn who all of my neighbors are. It took a while though haha. I go on walks quite often and make small talk. People person and so forth. I had that kind of community as a boy and now that I‚Äôm a parent I wanted my children to experience that too. Some of our favorite neighbors bring the kids gifts on holidays. We‚Äôre lucky. It‚Äôs doable with a little walk and a little talk...my kids help bridge the potentially awkward gap too. They‚Äôll talk to anyone!..just like Dad. :) I will add younger folks are frequently not as kind as older folks."
