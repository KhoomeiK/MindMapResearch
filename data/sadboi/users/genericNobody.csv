No matter how many times he says ""no"" to me on a spontaneous thing I will keep offering because I don't want him to feel like he's being left out but also I know that its on me a bit for not planning ahead.

The subject's left shoulder (our right) also appears to ...not exist? Or its placed super low, but the hoodie is masking its exact location.  Others have addressed anatomy though, so:

\- The top hand in particular looks like you got bored of rendering the skin tones and hoped the digital paint splatters would distract from noticing?  

\- the paint splatters themselves have no shading applied so it looks 2D and floating on top of the image

\- The hair is headed somewhere good but I would be careful about rendering all of the individual hairs too much, its flattening out the shape.  Also it looks like the head shape is off near the top, where it disappears behind the hand, but the hand partially blocking it masks it.

\- the positioning of one of the eyes is ever so slightly off, I think the top one might be too close to the nose? This area is rendered really well though.  A couple of tricks to help you here, cover half the face with your hand or a sheet of paper and then do the same to the other side.  Your brain will fill in the details from the missing half and you'll be surprised when you take the paper away how different it is.
