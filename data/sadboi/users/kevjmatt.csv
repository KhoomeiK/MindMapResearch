SkyrimMemes,fqmha30,t1_fqlmf06,1589477429.0,"Interesting perspective, but I only see that as a reason to be a little more suspicious of him instead of actually justifying his death.  I’d say that it often takes a large external force, or some big change, for most people, and characters in stories, to start them on the right path, even if that isn’t their original intention.  It could be that Paarthurnax betrayed Alduin out of fear of the gods, and even his own selfish gain, but this then allowed him to experience the human perspective when he taught them the Thu’um.  So I see what you mean about him reuniting with his old dovah thu’uming buddies, but I see it as more of an innocent-until-proven-guilty sort of thing, since he’s proven so helpful and disciplined so far.  

Also, to me, it’s always been even more impressive, and you might be trying to say this too, is that Paarthurnax has, at least in the past, demonstrated incredible willpower an discipline when it came to controlling his violent and oppressive nature in order to achieve what he thought was the right thing to do.  

Now, this is more just speculation, but I’ve also felt like the whole depicting Dovah as this species uniquely driven to dominate and fight, whether this was elder scrolls intention or not, is actually a symbol of real-world human nature and that Paarthurnax represents the more enlightened and good willed person in society, like redeemed human ex-bad guys in life and in stories,  that people look up to.  Given the right circumstances, all of us would feel some large need to violently dominate and control our peers and environment out of fear or uncertainty, but we learn to understand when that’s inappropriate and/or selfish.  Basically, good people are those who’ve learned to control their destructive traits out of empathy and a renewed desire to improve society rather than simply control it by force, and Paarthurnax is a prime example."

Even the amazing The Mandalorian for the sequels.  The only thing I truly can’t stand is Resistance, I’m cool with younger kid shows but they should stay separate from canon.
