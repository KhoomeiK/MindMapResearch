You can use that same leftover marinade from the ramen eggs, but since it doesn't require dashi, that should avoid the risk of getting an overly salty end product.

However, even the steamed eggs aren't usually meant to be coloured by the soy sauce, so here's a [recipe](https://thewoksoflife.com/steamed-eggs-with-crispy-pork/) that might work better - you can use the leftover marinade to season the stir fried pork topping."

counselling,fk940va,t3_fgpe1x,1583968265.0,"So sorry that you two have to go through this painful experience. I agree with the others that you need to locate the best help avaliable in your area, so without knowing your location it's hard to give specific information. But I wanted to add that if you're outside of North America or Europe, it can be hard to find someone who specialises in grief counselling itself. (I'm from Asia so I know this from experience). However, it would still be useful to find someone who is a highly recommended therapist even if they don't specialise in grief issues. Just the fact that they're licensed professionals can lead you two to a suitable avenue for working through your pain so that you can deal with the feelings of frustration, grief, despair etc in a safe space. But of course, the therapist needs to be good so I just wanted to remind you to focus on that criteria rather than on finding a grief specialist itself if options are limited. 

Besides that, I'm sure you're already being as supportive of your partner right now as you can and I hope they do the same for you. Just remember, we each grieve differently so even though it's a shared experience, you may not be experiencing the pain in the same way, so it's okay if you both need to handle it in different ways right now."

I too had a lot of struggles and initially couldn't find a good therapist as they were all too keen to suggest medications or just CBT, which bored me as I think deeply and quite a lot more quickly than most people.

Eventually, I stumbled upon a trainee psychologist who practised Gestalt therapy and while some of her techniques made me cringe at first because it's much more hands-on and physical than typical talk therapy, it turned out to be extremely useful and helped me so much that I have managed to pursue my studies in counselling and plan to become a  Gestalt practitioner as well, in the future (although I'll probably be more eclectic instead of pure Gestalt as the other orientations have useful techniques as well and clients have different needs).

I was always great at my job and none of my bosses wanted me to leave but either they or other staff were taking advantage of me in various ways and the environments just became unbearable for my personality. 

So I spent almost a year contemplating what next and finally buckled down to pursue my masters in counseling. Am more than halfway through and definitely nervous at times about whether I've made the right move because this is a total career change (I've worked in journalism and non-profits all this while).

But I do know that the time spent with clients thus far in my coursework have been so much more rewarding than any of the office work I've done before. I'm also hopeful that counselling is a career path that allows me greater flexibility and control over the scope of my job, especially in terms of limiting my interaction with other staff (office politics are the worst, ugh) & allowing me to focus on individuals for much of the day, instead of a mile-long task list like when I was doing communications work.

From what I can read in your post, I don't think it's just your personality or just the circumstances dragging you down.

Sounds like your company should probably hire extra staff to meet their deadline but they likely want to cut costs and thus, you get stuck with an unrealistic workload. 

But I am glad you have a good support system in place. It does wonders to know you're not alone when faced with stress. I do have a few friends and my family cares for me but I'm lacking in terms of close relationships and people that I can rely on. Nevertheless, I'm quite an independent person and I have a partner who's always been my biggest ally so I'm trying to focus on the positives.

Meditation is indeed helpful, I just need to get back into the routine of it again. The other things I do to engage myself meaningfully are cooking (my favorite creative outlet) and to exercise more, which also helps to boost my mood.

I'm worried about the codependcy thing as well and I've been trying to do my own thing more, like going out to exercise, cooking, reading etc but I can't deny that most of my socialising and communication is still happening with just my partner most of the time. It's especially worrying for me because my partner works out of town for 3 months at a time and is about to leave soon... No idea how I'm gonna cope successfully, which makes me feel like I'm quite pathetic.

That's how I do it at home, with instant dashi, as I never found a good ""blended miso"" product before. But you can save that product for using in other applications such as sauces, dressings etc. 

I also recommended adding a vegetable which you can boil for a longer period in the dashi (without the miso) as that will add more flavour as well. I love radish, kale or cabbage but many veggies work well."

Cooking,fipzl5s,t1_fipl4wb,1582629453.0,"They are indeed great in a lot of Indian dishes, most famous is chana masala of which there are loads of variations. But they can also be added to a regular curry, such as a prawn curry or beef mince curry, as a way to bulk it out. I do that sometimes to stretch out a more expensive protein and I love the extra flavours that the chickpeas can absorb."
Cooking,fipoxhl,t3_f95ti3,1582614584.0,"Roast cauliflower can be done in all kinds of ways from the really basic version with just salt and pepper to mixing it up with some herbs and spices.

I've done both Indian variations (turmeric, chilli and cumin powders) as well as more western types (dried mixed herbs and olive oil). Other variations are possible too like a more middle Eastern type with sumac, perhaps? I haven't tried that yet as the indian spiced ones are my fave."
Cooking,fipbjbh,t3_f8wxz6,1582602516.0,"Besides all the good tips given above, I'd also recommend getting a bottle of Chinese cooking wine (like Shaoxing) to put a few splashes into the sauce or in the marinade. It really rounds up the flavours nicely and since restaurants always use it, this will help your dish taste more like that."
Cooking,fipbdzh,t1_fiol7i5,1582602409.0,"This is very important too : Cook the protein separately (marinated first if possible) and set it aside to add back at the end of cooking. By removing the protein in this way, you ensure it doesn't overcook while allowing it to get nice browning too.

Also, yeah, always taste along the way so you can add whatever is missing."

That led me to choose non-profit work, journalism and political-related jobs for many years at the expense of earning a decent living. I really believed I should help make the world around me a better place. 

Although I did learn a lot through the hands-on experience, I've regretted it since because the things I saw left me so jaded and also massively stunted my financial growth. Moreover, change is a state of mind and the complex geopolitical realities we live in make individual changes almost entirely meaningless on a larger societal level."
AskReddit,fineh8k,t1_fimuxm5,1582561890.0,"Me too. It really sucks to know how badly many therapists, counsellors and other mental health professionals behave. In my country, it's even worse as the stigma around seeking mental health treatment is extremely high. 

But what's even worse is that my fellow classmates and even many lecturers don't take the profession seriously, they care far more about protecting themselves from liability and following their individual religious teachings than about being a source of support for the client. Most people in my program have so little empathy for clients and even less enthusiasm for learning theories, techniques, or new developments. Sigh, long way to go so I try not to be too discouraged and hope to contribute in my own small way."
AskReddit,findv56,t1_fin0fr3,1582561530.0,"Excellent points. As a counsellor in training, thanks for listing these down succinctly as a lot of clients don't know their rights and are unsure how to handle the process. Psycho education is still lacking, especially in my part of the world."

To me it's quite different, but the inner parts and the small leaves of the western celery is what tastes similar to Chinese celery, so perhaps that's a good sub. But yeah, a basic Chinese stock doesn't actually require many ingredients so it can be skipped altogether."
Cooking,fin19uv,t1_fims31f,1582553236.0,Yes you can do this. The white part of the green onions can be chopped into large segments and simmered in the stock.
Cooking,fin17c7,t1_fims37v,1582553182.0,"Actually, celery is more for western stocks, not actually native to Asian countries so its rarely used. But Chinese celery is a herb and is used frequently, though I'm not sure of its availability overseas.

I agree with you about all the other additions though! Adding coriander roots/stem could also be good.

If you have white pepper, use that instead of black as Chinese stocks prefer it, but black is fine too. You can also add some dried shitake mushrooms, dashi powder or kombu seaweed if you have access to these - all are rich in umami and will boost the richness of the stock."

Honestly, I really wasn't being aggressive, just wanted to counter what seemed like a stereotype against a cultural practice in my part of the world."
Cooking,fimxlyq,t3_f8p0vg,1582550264.0,"It is fairly different in that there's a fresh ""spiciness"" to it which the powdered stuff doesn't have. It's not like it packs actual chilli. heat, but it's something like a milder version of the heat ginger provides.

Lots of southern Thai, Malay and Indonesian dishes use fresh turmeric, namely it is blended up with other herbs and spices to make a paste for a curry, broth (such as laksa) or stew (such as rendang).

[Thai turmeric chicken soup](https://hot-thai-kitchen.com/turmeric-chicken-soup/) uses a few other herbs like galangal as well. I've made it, it's so good for when you're sick.

WeWantPlates,fimq1xl,t1_fijmo79,1582542238.0,"Lol, have you actually eaten off of a banana leaf? For South Indian food, rice is often central and eating on the leaf makes perfect sense, as long as the leaf is clean and it obviously can't be reused. Since its an easily available plant here, it's a good system and there's nothing unhygienic about it."

Cooking,fimm1wv,t1_fimia79,1582536503.0,"Yup, this is what I do if I want strong garlic flavour. Especially for stews and soups, I often also add some whole cloves of garlic because these becomes lovely and sweet by the end of the dish. Even if some of them start to dissolve into the sauce, it's all just extra flavour so I always add extra garlic."

Chinese Cooking Demystified is really good and so is Woks of Life, but you can also try Magic Ingredients on YouTube. I haven't made her recipes yet but I can see its authentic.

Korean Bapsang is also good for Korean, besides. Maangchi.

On a separate note, yes there is indeed a Japanese version of mapo tofu and it doesn't involve Szechuan peppercorn and uses minimal which makes it far less spicy and numbing. I personally like that (and also the Korean mapo tofu which uses gochujang & doenjang) since I'm not a fan of the mala flavours but yeah, CCD makes the authentic Szechuan version."
Cooking,fimd197,t1_filp2xc,1582525541.0,"My thoughts exactly. Sure, they have similarities but there are some key differences too and as they've evolved differently due to cultural reasons, both cuisines deserve to be celebrated on their own right.

As India is so large and diverse, it has so many sub-cuisines too which really differ dramatically and their eating styles are so different too (down to which carbs, herbs, dairy etc are preferred) so it's an unnecessarily sweeping statement to just say its all basically the same."
Cooking,fimcpvh,t1_fim9smd,1582525215.0,"That Japanese spaghetti dish you had was probably spaghetti napolitan, which has nothing to do with Naples or Italy, just a Japanese take on pasta where they stir fry the noodles with sausages, capsicums and... Wait for it, ketchup. Lol, i get how some people find this an abomination but I find it tasty as long as no one tries to pass it off as authentic Italian food.

The Salisbury steak thing is called Hambagu which I also really like and recently made a version of. Japanese yoshuko food is really nice to me, but I can see how purists find it odd cuz it's obviously fusion and can sometimes be done poorly."

It's an easy and fun way to change things up as you'd have to search around for ways to use that ingredient which pushes you outside the usual comfort zone. In terms of websites, I'd recommend Woks of Life, Hot Thai Kitchen, Maangchi, Cooking With Dog, Just One Cookbook, NoobCook and Bong Eats to get you started."

Also, adobo only improves over time so the leftovers actually taste even better. Plus, it's easy to tweak if I want to make it spicy (add some chillis) or sweeter (pineapple juice is great) etc."
