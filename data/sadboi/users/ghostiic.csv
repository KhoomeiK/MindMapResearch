Oregon- I was laid off last week due to the coronavirus. I was told since I haven‚Äôt been with my company for a year, I will have rehireable status but am not guaranteed a job when they reopen.

Do I have to do that? I thought I wouldn‚Äôt have to because it‚Äôs coronavirus related, but I think I screwed up my application by saying it was a permanent layoff.

Thor is about a year and half old. I got him for free on a goat farm. There was just a lady there adopting out free kittens. I tried to resist, I really did.

Random_Acts_Of_Amazon,fj247yo,t3_fajy42,1582934132.0,"My reason to smile is that I had to take my snake to the vet.

My grandparents loaned me money so I could get her some really good treatment and she‚Äôs already looking so much better and being active in her cage again. 

Another reason is that I‚Äôve been struggling financially for awhile, to the point of having panic attacks and suicidal thoughts, but I discovered I have an extra day to come up with rent (forgot it‚Äôs a leap year lol) and I have a couple leads on a job after months of searching. It just finally feels like things might work out. :)"

depression,fi52ozi,t1_fi4zpup,1582153611.0,The problem is that my roommate (my sister) is going back to Iowa whether I go or not. So I have three months to either make enough money to move home or make enough money to afford an apartment on my own out here- if I stay in my current place I have to pay twice as much rent each month and if I move I have to. come up with first and last month rent and deposit. I‚Äôm not making enough money and no one will hire me. And yes I want to get into another profession but how am I supposed to do that when all I have experience in is food service and retail? I owe my old college $3000 before I can even think about trying to finish my degree and obviously can‚Äôt afford to pay that off right now. I don‚Äôt have any good options
depression,fi4g9d9,t1_fi33qs4,1582140579.0,"I tried moving. It didn‚Äôt work out. I moved a few months ago from Iowa to Oregon. I had a free place to stay while I looked for an apartment and I had my current job lined up before I even got here. I was really trying hard to start over and have the kind of life I want but it hasn‚Äôt worked out. I burned through all my savings. My job won‚Äôt give me enough hours (I was getting 16-20 and was disappointed. They promised it would get better after Christmas but now I‚Äôm only getting 8-10 hours a week). 

I want to move back to Iowa when my lease is up in three months and get my old job back. I already asked my old boss and he said I could have it. I have to get there by May 30th so I can work this huge event -that‚Äôs the whole reason he‚Äôs giving me the job back, so he won‚Äôt have to hire and train a new person, but at this point I don‚Äôt even think I can afford to get home. I‚Äôm barely scraping by. Rent is due in two weeks and I don‚Äôt have it. I‚Äôve applied for several jobs a day for months now and haven‚Äôt even gotten an interview. Except for one phone interview which didn‚Äôt go well. I don‚Äôt have money for a therapist. I don‚Äôt have money to put aside for gas to get home. 

I literally don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. I was unhappy in Iowa. I worked two jobs for a year to save up for this move. I finally did it and now I‚Äôm unhappy out here. I think I‚Äôm just an unhappy person. I can‚Äôt picture a future where I‚Äôm anything other than miserable tbh"

The ten top just said, ‚Äúyep that‚Äôs us‚Äù and sat down. The hostess didn‚Äôt even realize until the main guy from the 18 top came to ask what was up with their table.
