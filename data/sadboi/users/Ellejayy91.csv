MOST IMPORTANTLY: He is making you uncomfortable. You are under NO obligation to tolerate any unwanted touching or any type of inappropriate interaction for the sake of the rest of the family.

Honestly, the way you worded it here was so eloquent and forthcoming that I think it would be fair to repeat this to your husband. If he asks you all of those questions you can tell him e aptly what you've told us. You didn't want to believe it was happening so you brushed it off. Now that it's becoming harder to deny, you want to do the right thing by telling your husband, but you're afraid to cause problems within the family. I think having a conversation with your husband where you express exactly what you've expressed above is a great starting point. Ultimately, the person you are married to is the one you need to communicate with first and then you can discuss as a team what actions you may or may not want to take moving forward."

I've sort of accepted my diagnosis since I can look back and see symptoms prior to medication with their onset being at the typical age. Doctors only get snapshots of our lives so they don't always get it all right. Maybe do some reflection on your moods/behaviors over your lifetime. If this is the first time you've ever experienced this type of thing, you may not be bipolar. Ultimately, if you struggle with depression and feel you medication is helpful it may be beneficial to seek a non SSRI anyway if they cause that type of reaction. Labels are irrelevant (easier said).

Hopefully your doctor has a plan to order regular bloodwork to monitor your levels so that won't happen, but you should have the final say in what medications you decide to take.

Also, immune systems are not measured by weight and vaccine ""doses"" are not measured the same way other medications are because, well, it's not necessary. Small dogs can sometimes be more prone to an allergy to the Leptospirosis vaccine, which is often included with the Distemper vaccine cocktail. This is an allergy, not a problem with the vaccine. Some people are allergic to penicillin, but I digress. If a dog's immune system is already compromised to the point where a vaccine proves lethal, then quite frankly it wouldn't matter how much of the vaccine they received. The Rabies vaccine is legally required in most, if not all States for good reasons. Would you want the neighbor's unvaccinated dog chasing squirrels or other wild animals and then biting you or your own unvaccinated dog? Or your child?"
