It’s not your fault.
I’m sorry that they took away your innocence. I’m sorry that they created a living Hell that you have to fight with every single day. I’m sorry that life seems pointless now, living is painful and you can’t help but look at your scars.
But you didn’t deserve it.
And do you know what nature says?
Caterpillars become butterflies.

I’m sorry that they cut away your wings.
But I promise you.
You will fly again."

mentalillness,fqcb83o,t3_gi0uep,1589254073.0,"It’s not the option. Life can be a real pain sometimes, I know. But your strength lies in not giving up. You can do it. I’m sure you will.
Everyone deserves happiness.
You’re not alone. You have yourself, this is the only thing that matters at the end.
Nobody will ever know you better than you, but trust me, somebody will get close to that point one day."
