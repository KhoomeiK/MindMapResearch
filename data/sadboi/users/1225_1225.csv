It’s like I used to be so scared of finding out if I was being cheated on, and now I’m basically looking for every little way I could be being cheated on so that I can end the pain and humiliation right there.

It’s not knowing for sure and that pit in my stomach I can’t get rid of that any trust I give will be abused.  That once I give that trust away no matter what or who I give it too it’s going to be thrown in my face.

She simply asked that since beauty school is only about 18k for the whole thing (we both know that’s a lot but in comparison to her brothers school fund it’s barley if even 10%) and her parents have basically refused.

I’ll express huge gratitude and she’ll look at me all confused.

ptsd,fk9b95g,t3_fh73cu,1583972524.0,Stay strong...it’s scary when you feel it coming in a public place and you just wanna gtfo there.  Just make it home and relax
relationship_advice,fk8pq9w,t3_fgu3ov,1583960551.0,This girl seems pretty mf worthless...  2 months and already cheating while living with you?  Don’t let yourself keep getting played
DeadBedrooms,fk8gfza,t1_fk7ytgw,1583955568.0,"This discovery is pretty new so no I haven’t read the books just online research mostly.  A good one I found between me and her is occasional nudes which I think is a start.  Both of us were totally cool and happy with that outcome. But maybe there’s more?  Idk...  I understand there may not be but it doesn’t hurt to look on different places of reddit.  I’m not sure how to recreate those moments bc she won’t let me anymore...like I’ve said before I believe her if she says she’s asexual.  However, the same time she realized this she was given 2x the amount of Prozac she was on, and is on birth control.  As well as a few other things but I just don’t want to be doing literally nothing the rest of my life bc then I’ll just feel like a sperm donor"

BPD,fk6vd39,t1_fk6t85a,1583917819.0,"Wow I’m really sorry to hear all of that.  The anti-med/therapy thing is probably what made it worse.  I’m open to both for my PTSD but so far only medicine that works seems to be weed, and therapists these days are hard to find (since now everyone in the world things they have depression or anxiety, not to discredit those that actually have mental illness but imo everyone seems to think they have something bc they have a bad day sometimes).  My only worry is the part about identity switching/not knowing who you are.  I know people change but she has said sometimes she has no idea who she is, which kinda scared me a little bit.  What is that part of BPD like?"
DeadBedrooms,fk6v507,t1_fk6t7hx,1583917528.0,"It’s not that I don’t like the responses, it’s just that some aren’t answering what I’m really asking, and one response on this post I just disagreed with.  I am not 100% sure she is really asexual as I feel there’s probably a lot of other factors that contribute to her LL"
BPD,fk6sph2,t1_fk6sab0,1583914494.0,"I’m so sorry to hear that, I’m sorry the illnesses got the best of the relationship and I’m curious if your comfortable sharing as to how it got to that point?  What are some things I should be cautious about?  And from your POV how/when did it get toxic?"
relationship_advice,fk6p145,t3_fgr27a,1583909883.0,"Dude fuck that.  I funded someone’s life before and all it did was set back almost a decade of hard work and good money management.  I’m trapped living with my mom for another 2 months and have to work full time while going to school.  I want to kill my fucking self over the whole situation sometimes.  But I’m in a new relationship that’s amazing school is going well(ish).  But don’t let your hard earned money be manipulated out of your pocket...trust me please.  Fuckin run, or if you still wanna move to Montana bc of all the things you mentioned....move there then...BUT NOT WITH HER"
relationship_advice,fk6oi39,t1_fk6o5zg,1583909263.0,"Fair enough, but in today’s legal system you gotta be careful about that shit.  I’m not the dude who thinks every girl is lying, I typically believe the woman when they say something like that...but to many times have I seen the opposite not just in the news but first hand through people I met in the service"
relationship_advice,fk6niay,t1_fk6d14o,1583908132.0,Well tbh it would be a major dealbreaker for me as well.  My life experiences would be telling me to run
relationship_advice,fk6nfnt,t1_fk6jefa,1583908053.0,"Yeah, I’m with this.  All of those things seem like such a stretch from your gfs POV, and with my experiences I would’ve left immediately.  Not trying to be a dick, but I think this relationship is over.  Bc she will never believe you, and this whole situation is kinda fucked"
relationship_advice,fk6n5z0,t3_fgglef,1583907758.0,"My ex wife used to do this whenever I’d catch her cheating (like to many times to fuckin count lol), or if I’d ask her to do ANYTHING that required an oz of effort. 

Ex:  there’s no phone chargers in the apartment so instead of going to the store across the fuckin street she’d gaslight tf out of my and say it was PTSD or anxiety and I’m such a POS (for the record I’m almost positive her “trauma” was made up and she never had PTSD...I’m not a dick I had a mountain of evidence to this)

Leave this dude it will only get worse and you’ll never get to have any real convorsations...  I have pretty bad CPTSD and even in my worst moments I’m still able to have an argument with my current girlfriend or deal with triggering things and the fact that some people use their mental illness (or go as far as to fake one) as a crutch to avoid accountability or to manipulate others (usually romantic partners) is sickening to me.  I get that these things make life harder...trust me I know, but decent people with mental illness don’t “use it to their advantage”"

relationship_advice,fk6jo14,t1_fk6ghsb,1583904201.0,"Sounds familiar minus the kids part (thank fucking god) for me.  Mine was extreme level abuse and straight up torment.  Was trapped in it literally due to life circumstances on top of the legal part of it...dark ass days... still a lil fucked up from it (not bc I miss her or it didn’t work out, genuinely so glad she’s not my problem anymore just the trauma in general, and have found an AMAZING woman to take her place)"
relationship_advice,fk6cc0p,t1_fk5su5d,1583898456.0,The post is deleted lmao I was looking forward to reading that as I also have a marriage (not anymore) that sounds like what that post was talking about...lol wanted a good laugh at what I put my own dumbass self through
DeadBedrooms,fk4n3ck,t1_fk4mlhy,1583863697.0,"I ping pong between feeling that way, and understanding it is also a lot of stuff on her end preventing her from enjoying sex.  Since her and I have agreed to nudes for now, I’m a little more content bc she’s shown that she is trying"
relationship_advice,fk4eoyg,t1_fk4ed76,1583858977.0,To be honest I’d say it’s worth at least mentioning.  Everytime I hold onto shit bc I’m worried about pissing my girlfriend off she always tells me “if your hurting just say something slut” and then we’ll have a rational conversation and it works out everytime
relationship_advice,fk4dn75,t3_fgem6r,1583858387.0,"I’m in the same boat, I have PTSD from my past relationship and I got into another one a lot quicker than I expected to but I wasn’t going to let this girl pass me by.  She’s amazing in every way,  but like you’ve mentioned you don’t want it creeping into your current relationship.  Bc I got into one so soon, I was very open about my mindset and how I’m going to work on it but I have a very cautions and paranoid mindset.  Since I was open about it she’s been so good at communicating to me in a way that calms me down without making me feel like an asshole.  I would just let him know what your thoughts are but most importantly WHY you think that way."
DeadBedrooms,fk4be7q,t1_fk4b230,1583857129.0,"Well I’d never tell this to her face but I have other theories for her being “asexual”.  I believe her if that’s what she tells me but I think it’s medications/unresolved issues/body image problems.  But let’s say I’m wrong, then oh well.  The times we have had sex she was very into it"
DeadBedrooms,fk4b3j4,t1_fk3fck0,1583856962.0,"Yeah, I’m HL af, but that doesn’t mean I only need one part of a relationship.  I’ve had the other side of that and I was miserable and it only lasted 3 months before I cut her off.  Sex was 2-5 times everyday, but it was such an annoying relationship.  I know your gunna say we’ll find one that is the best of both then, but maybe my current gf makes me happy enough to stay and work on this...dont see the weakness in that"
DeadBedrooms,fk4aqah,t1_fk3gey9,1583856753.0,"Will do, and if it is then fine but I figured why not post on reddit to see if there’s more options out there?"
DeadBedrooms,fk4ajlg,t1_fk3nhj4,1583856649.0,A lot of asexual/sexual partners find comprimise
