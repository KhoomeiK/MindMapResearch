It clearly seems like he is harboring some resentment towards you and from the sound of things this is no longer a manageable situation.  His anger has prevented him from thinking rationally. If you decide to stay with him til you get more solid footing, which I couldn't in good conscious recommend, then it would not make you a bad person, at all.  But you do not deserve the emotional abuse you are currently receiving!  Are you on the lease? Do you have friends or family who might temporarily house the cats? You could also break up with him and stay there, depending on the situation with the lease and if things then get dangerous, get in the police involved.  I'd also reach out to the women's shelter.  They may be able to offer some advice on temporarily housing the cats.

Stretching,fnn0wxt,t3_g2nmae,1587082073.0,"There's a very big difference between muscular neck pain and nerve-based neck pain.  Are you sure it's muscular?  Spasming or ""locking up"" sensation could indicate muscular.  Sharp pain that radiates, especially when lifting or turning your head with possible tingling, numbness, or weakness could indicate nerve.  Nerve-based: it's smart to see a doctor for the radiating.  Either way though, I'm not sure you really need to warm up the muscle.  You are much better off icing for 15 minutes 4-6 times a day.  Regularly take an antiinflammatory like you have been doing and continue to rest.  Different people's bodies are different and this may not make a noticeable difference but you could avoid inflammatory foods like carbs, sugars, and nightshades. Do not stretch or try to reestablish range of motion until the pain improves! Once that happens you could stand with your hands behind your neck, bend your neck back and look at the ceiling, squeeze your shoulder blades together.  Hold for a moment and then return to the position.  You could also try basic head rotation to the left and right.  As well as tilting your head to the left and right.  All of these stretches up to ten reps but wait for the pain to improve.  Disclaimer: I am not a doctor.  Call your primary care physician."

It's only recently that I've come to realize that they have the capacity to be just as emotionally immature as anyone else.  It seems to me that any sort of pain or trauma can get trapped in time and a part of us then buries that hurt.  In turn, a part of us can potentially stay quite emotionally fragile.  If your Mom is lying to your brother, it may be out of shame.  There's a chance she won't be able to overcome whatever it is thats preventing her from allowing you guys to keep the dogs.  If that's the case, while her actions may have significantly hurt you, I hope that you can trust that she thinks she is doing what is best for the family-- as with your father in supporting your mother, even if you know in your heart that they're wrong.

Advice,f5ulveg,t3_dpe1x6,1572475664.0,"I'm so sorry that this happened to you. This doesn't sound like a fun situation.  If you can, I would suggest seeing a therapist regardless of how you feel a few days from now.  Hopefully he or she is someone you like that can be of some help to you during the grieving process.  Just remember that what you are feeling is legitimate. Over these next couple days, I would make sure to check in with your emotions.  And say in your head ""I notice I'm feeling X.""  For me, the act of noticing and putting that space there can be helpful.  It's both helped me grieve and to make sure that I respond rationally, as opposed to impulsively.  

As to what to do in terms of the dogs -- that's a much trickier situation. How old are you? Ultimately, it probably will fall on your Mom to decide if she feels safe with those dogs in the house.  What  was the other dog doing while this was happening?  If your mom agrees to it, and considering that dog didnt show aggression towards humans, I would suggest seeing if you could at least readopt that one pooch.  I would see if that would be okay with your mother.  Ultimately though, it seems you'll probably have to accept and respect her decision.  

You really love dogs. If re-adopting your dog isn't an option, I suggest adopting a puppy and training the puppy to be tolerant of the cats.  If you're moving out in a few years, I would maybe ask your parents if you in particular could adopt the dog.  Don't think of it as a replacement, but just a new chapter, someone new to love.  Again, I'm so sorry that this happened to you."
