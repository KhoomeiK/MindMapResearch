when the body is in a safe space, it's an effective time to try and heal the persecutors to reform them into protectors (or any other role they're comfortable holding). for us, our persecutors/ protectors have an excellent sense of danger/safety, and can get a pretty accurate read on a situation as long as we're balancing the ""facts"" with the ""gut feelings"".

this is really beautiful what you wrote. it's amazing to hear how your system has come together to piece your history together. I'm really struck by this part especially: 

>he both was left by the other, and at the same time, he abandoned the others because he couldn't hang on to them anymore

It made me tear up. that is the exact feeling. we tried so hard. we fought to keep the body ""safe"" for so long, and it was (in our experience) a thankless and lonely job. It's so easy to see ourselves as the one last ""flaw"" in a system through our healing. we're protectors that have been a bit corrupted (""corrupted"" might not describe your experience, i just thought that word worked for me). 

i notice you mentioned ""not being strong enough"" a few times. it makes sense to feel like there was something you could have done to prevent pain. I guess that's the protector in us, wanting to be strong for someone else. 

it's also important to be mindful of our judgments of what ""strength"" is. Is ""strength"" enduring abuse without dissociating? Dissociation is a defense mechanism our brains developed to protect ourselves. For us, there are times dissociation *meant* strength. I am here because the body needed protection. An abuser chose *weakness* when they chose to take out their anger and insecurities on a defenseless child. I don't personally think it's fair to ask a child or anyone to be ""stronger"" than the cruelty they experienced. it feels like you could still be blaming yourself for what happened. the abuse was not your choice, and not your fault. 

anyway. i don't have it all figured out myself, but i think your post helped me view my choices in a more positive light, and i hope my reply helps you a little bit. all the best.

CompulsiveOverEaters,fpxeijq,t3_gfecux,1588981128.0,"Hey there. Sorry to hear you're struggling with this. It's so hard. I used to be right where you're at, suffering for decades. I would consider myself mostly recovered from BED. I still binge occasionally, maybe 1-2 times a month in stressful times, and those are far from my most harmful binges (just to give you an idea of where I'm coming from).

There's 3 key things I had to change to begin my path to recovery:

First, you need to have the willingness to recover. You need to *really believe* that you will one day live a life where you're not shackled by this. It's okay to feel hopeless at times, just be mindful of those hopeless thoughts, let them pass, and turn toward your willingness to recover. Easier said than done, i know. it takes practise...a lot of practise, and it's worth it. 

Second: If you have any calorie counting apps, uninstall them and download Recovery Road instead. It's a meal tracking app with no numbers, which is what we need to guard ourselves against. Counting calories and minutes of exercise will generally *never* help those in recovery for EDs. RR gives us space to be mindful of our mood before/ after meals, and a space to be mindful of binge/ restrict urges. It rewards a food entry with a picture of kittens or an inspiring quote, too! You can also connect the app with a therapist or sponser, if you so choose. And you don't have to use an app, of course, but if you choose to journal instead, refrain from including any numbers. Focus on how you feel emotionally and physically before, during, and after disordered eating. 

Thirdly, you have to learn to love your body. We must stop the after-binge hate we give to ourselves. I know, it's really hard. We've had this adversarial relationship with this bag of bones for so long, how can we ever reconcile? I try to find something I'm thankful for that my body does at least once a day. I would recommend choosing body parts that are not triggering for you at first.  Picked up this mug? Thank you, biceps! Dusty day outside? Thanks for keeping it out of my eyes, eyelashes! Small things. Then work your way up to more challenging body parts.

The most useful therapy for me was DBT. They have you use a weekly diary card to track ""target behaviors"", and this really helped me confront my patterns and vulnerabilities to disordered eating. 

If there aren't any DBT programs near you, perhaps ERP or CBT could also work. I know over half of folks diagnosed with eating disorders are also diagnosed with OCD, that's why I mention ERP. [Here's some more info on that.](https://www.eatingrecoverycenter.com/blog/2016/11/01/erp-for-binge-eating-laura-lange)

Some therapists are seeing clients over the phone or video chat fyi!

My recovery took about 2-3 years I'd say. There's no right way to do this, and the way that works for me might not be your path. All the best, friend."

we *really* need to steer away from the ""my team vs your team"" nonsense political parties are trying to push, it's reductionistic. it's okay to criticize the figurehead of a party, that's the whole point of the first amendment. it's probably the most USA thing you can do! 

i know the two party system makes it seem like a binary, but biden has done gross fucked up shit too (in addition to being a rapist) he's just not as obnoxious and loud as trump. if the dnc really *really* wanted to win, i would think they'd ..at *least* check their candidate's background. but they don't care, because they are assuming that simply saying ""I'm not trump"" will be enough. 

and for some people that *is* enough, and that's valid. and for some people that *isn't* enough, which is also valid. many folks choosing not to vote for Biden are survivors of sexual violence. i cannot ask someone who has been through that shit to participate in normalizing the culture and behavior that led to terrible personal pain. 

this is a really complex election with many, many layers. i think, though, it's important for us to not just blame voters. there are so many obstacles to voting in any US election ; voter suppression is alive and well, along with COVID -19 complicating issues further. 

 i think, similar to how blaming climate change on individuals is short-sighted, it would also be short-sighted to blame individual voters for the larger electoral system not working.

ENLIGHTENEDCENTRISM,fpotj8m,t1_fpo4zmj,1588790407.0," humans aren't innately selfish like we've been taught. capitalism incentivizes selfish behavior. 

a simple test is this: who does it benefit the most for workers to believe that all humans are innately selfish? the rich! those in power get to stay in power when the workers believe the lie that capitalism is a ""natural"" result of human behavior. take a look at early human history, and you'll see that overall, as a species, we trend toward pro-social behavior. 

capitalism will hopefully just be a sociopathic century-long blip on the wider picture of human history."

CPTSDmemes,fpom1ky,t1_fpnitad,1588786764.0,"it's understandable to feel overwhelmed or not really know where to start. i sometimes still feel that way. reading books about trauma is helpful, i feel like therapy is also really helpful. therapy with a trauma specialist is what has been shown to be effective for many people. one type of therapy for trauma is EMDR. (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing)

in emdr, we hold the traumatic memory close to us and let ourselves experience the full breadth of feelings. sadness, anger, fear, joy. we examine the negative self - belief (""i am not safe, i do not deserve respect"" etc) and eventually replace it with a positive self belief (""i am resilient, i deserve respect"" etc). i spent about 8 sessions ( 2 months ) on a ""milder trauma"", but everyone processes pain differently at different speeds, and that's okay. 

this is a really general overview, but r/emdr can probably answer more questions. i will say it's *vital* for folks with cptsd to find a therapist trained in specifically handling trauma, emdr or not. a typical therapist, out of ignorance, might accidentally do more damage by mishandling their client. 

it's long, hard work. I'm pretty sure anyone with cptsd would take at least a year minimum to unpack everything. we were all in pain for so long, though; it's okay to take a while to heal. I'm thinking in 5 years i will be a lot closer to living the life i want, which is a long time, but it's better than not trying, i think."
