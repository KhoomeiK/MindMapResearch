BingeEatingDisorder,fe0cmxp,t3_enar9t,1578809913.0,"My recommendation is to delay the ""instant satisfaction"" (which is immediately followed up with feelings of guilt, shame, and regret) for as long as humanly possible. And if all else fails and you give into temptation, DO NOT BE SO DAMN HARD ON YOURSELF! I've struggled with binge eating for pretty much as long as I can remember

This past year, for the first time in my entire life, I managed to maintain the same weight and I know to some that may not seem like a big deal but for a person who has never been able to maintain a steady weight for any extended period of time, this is great progress in my recovery. I believe this was possible because around this time last year, my therapist told me two things: to not be so mean to myself as well as be mindful of what and why I was eating."

No. Just no! I don't do this for you bitch! If I could just hop out of bed and brush my hair as is and call it a day, I just might but it's not that simple."

AmItheAsshole,f7g1ur4,t3_dvtnxa,1573692390.0,"NTA . I'd say take her to get box braids or cornrows and call it a day she's not going to be able to take out+ 30 braids by herself. Her hair is going to rip and break if you don't protect it in some sort of way so if she gets it braided, you won't have to style it or detangle it for a decent amount of time. She'll probably fall asleep halfway through and then depending on how well you maintain it, it can last you like 3 weeks on a little one. I would also suggest getting her a doll with similar texture and teaching her how to braid so the idea doesn't come across so much as torture! Maybe let her comb mommy and daddys hair? I know you didn't come for advice but this is what was helpful for me as a kid with mixed hair of a straight-haird white mom"

""I tried that before, it didn't help"" well did you talk to your therapist? Did you develop any sense of trust in your therapist/ councilor? Change therapists! Not everyone is right for you and in my experience, finding a the right one for you is a lot like finding the right partner.. there's equal give - take as well as  good communication, and chemistry! You may not ever deal with your shit if you can't find a professional to talk to."

I feel like your interaction may have unintentionally given him the incentive to continue calling you that because you didn't indicate to him that you felt it was inappropriate. With some Tennant's, they might find it funny and maybe he misread you when he first tried that one out on you. Keep in mind, he opens doors for a living so it may just be the highlight of his day to have interaction with those who pass through."
