I’m a therapist myself and a mindset coach and also recovered Borderline- so I’m trying to get my colleagues to be less blind to the facts.

BorderlinePDisorder,fpkncog,t1_fpi38cu,1588697723.0,"BPD is currently being studied at McLean Hospital and has been for the last 25 years. This longitudinal study has found that BPD is not a chronic illness, but a serious mental illness with a good prognosis. It is an NIMH funded study at the McLean Study of Adult Development (MSAD). It used to be considered a lifelong disease, though this recent research has disproven that this has to be the case."
BorderlinePDisorder,fpkmtcd,t1_fpk029y,1588697457.0,People with BPD don’t just have PTSD though. The difference is in the genetic component - people with BPD have what researchers have termed a hyperbolic temperament- this isn’t true for all people with PTSD. The diagnoses are different. I understand what you mean entirely though. It’s tough because of the stigma so CPTSD and PTSD are the labels given. The success I have had in treating it comes with a clear recognition of the hyperbolic temperament. Any effort in helping those diagnosed is great.

BorderlinePDisorder,fpdqipx,t3_gcw0p0,1588532201.0,"BPD is often misdiagnosed as Bipolar Disorder, especially Bipolar Type II (NAMI) 40 % is a large number of misdiagnoses - these are two very different disorders with two very different treatments and outcomes. Bipolar disorder mood swings are a bit more random whereas borderline mood swings are usually related to a social situation. The diagnosis is often withheld from loved ones by clinicians, especially teens, for fear that the stigma will impact them long term."
BorderlinePDisorder,fpdpe70,t1_fpdp9cy,1588531559.0,It’s not dishonest. Just because you haven’t found your peace doesn’t mean others can’t. There are many people that agree with this post and have felt remission firsthand. I’m sorry you can’t get there.
BorderlinePDisorder,fpdn8vr,t1_fpdn3xs,1588530339.0,Yes we have a hyperbolic temperament that does not go away. This is talking about symptom remission- the negative aspects of having such a temperament.
BorderlinePDisorder,fpdle0f,t1_fpdl7bl,1588529282.0,They are saying that if people find purpose and live healthy lives they will recover. But that would mean you are wrong and you just can’t stand that I would advocate for hope.
BorderlinePDisorder,fpdlbem,t1_fpdl7bl,1588529241.0,Great- why don’t you take away the hope from the people that can recover by taking a small screen shot of a larger study so it can fit your own selfish need to stay sick. That’s a great plan.
BorderlinePDisorder,fpdauan,t1_fpd5w14,1588523342.0,I hear this all too often. I am a therapist and a life coach- I have life coach clients who have therapists and still come to see me because their therapists don’t ever tell them the truth. Idk about that kind of therapy- what’s the point ? Truth creates change .
BorderlinePDisorder,fpcmdaz,t1_fpbqraw,1588505911.0,"This woman, Dr. Zanarini is at the forefront of the most current research for BPD. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=nGtw66RljKk this video talks about the harmful effects of aggressive polypharmacy - being prescribed several different kinds of medications. Oftentimes people with BPD are taking an antipsychotic, an antidepressant, a mood stabilizer, etc. but these meds are not curative. There is no proof that being on more medications then a person with a diagnosis of schizophrenia helps us. One med at a time. If the prescriber wants us to calm down and gives us a bunch of meds, they are abusing medications. Zanarini says it best here- meds aren’t for the people around us , they are for us! Here is another article about meds and BPD https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3513859/"
BPDSOFFA,fpclkaw,t1_fp1sn2x,1588505079.0,She does but she is thinking that about herself - like no one cares about the agony she feels. So you get lost in that because that becomes the most important thing- lack of empathy

BorderlinePDisorder,fpclcni,t1_fpcabto,1588504855.0,I’m so happy to hear that you found people to help you. That’s amazing. I’m sorry that they overmedicated you. I was in the same boat. I think they took a dart and threw it at a board with a bunch of pharmaceutical rep swag on it and prescribed me whatever hit at the time. Smh. Positive vibes to you
BorderlinePDisorder,fpcl8kl,t1_fpbn9ih,1588504732.0,"Yes ! I have been over medicated too- trazedone, naltrexone, ability, klonopin, lamictal ... enough time sedate a small elephant. And in the end the only med that helped me (and I don’t even take it anymore) was Ritalin because it helped me learn how to not be so impulsive. Antipsychotics and heavy meds are not curative and cause a host of other issues for us."

Also : Discussion

Five main findings have emerged from this study. The first is that remissions lasting two to eight years are extremely common for borderline patients (and axis II comparison subjects). In fact, cumulative rates at 16-year follow-up for borderline patients ranged from a high of 99% for a two-year remission to 78% for an eight-year remission. These results are consistent with and extend our findings pertaining to the first 10 years of prospective follow-up in this study where we found that 93% of borderline patients had achieved a remission lasting two years (5).

BPDSOFFA,foznqqg,t1_foznjae,1588193733.0,Try and “fight for her” - BPD is very complicated. Maybe this podcast will help . [From Borderline to Beautiful Podcast](https://anchor.fm/rose-skeeters) let us know if you need more support
BPDSOFFA,fozm5s3,t3_gah4bx,1588192976.0,She may want to know that you are into her and that you accept her dx.
BPDSOFFA,fozkpcz,t1_foyweyf,1588192277.0,"2 is more likely in my head too. I’m sorry it’s so tough. I am new to reddit and was in a loved ones support group- was kicked out because I have BPD and apparently represent a lot of evil because of it, even tho I recovered. I appreciate that perspective tho because I can see where I would be the enemy to people who have had relationships with people with BPD. I’m sorry on behalf of all of us. 💕💪"
BPD,foz5po7,t1_foy7wy4,1588185123.0,"For sure. For me, it’s more because I want what I want so that (unfortunately) would be the most important thing, rather than the person in front of me. I was more interested in getting my way- getting my validation."
BPD,foxwq45,t1_fox62je,1588158870.0,"Same. There are different kinds of empathy- we can feel deeply for people that are in pain but in intimate relationships, there is a lack of ability to see that people have thoughts, feelings, and perceptions different from our own.  I had that too- it’s related to theory of mind 🙃"
BorderlinePDisorder,foxwj6e,t3_g9v374,1588158689.0,"There are some really awesome suggestions here. When I found out it was BPD, I started researching everything and anything that could possibly help. DBT workbooks, books about BPD, etc. I was determined not to be part of the stigma and a statistic. We are a pretty passionate bunch lol! I was in training to become and therapist at the time and I used moral compass work and my own “treatment” with theory of mind development to recover. BPD has a good prognosis. You can recover. I’m a therapist now and a podcast host and I just love helping people- sure it’s not easy no way!

BPD,foxvysr,t3_g9smkr,1588158153.0,"BPDers have a hyperbolic temperament that neurotypical people don’t have. We feel things more deeply. Your feelings are valid even when the people around you can’t understand that. They can’t be in our heads and even if they could, I doubt they’d survive it. I’m a therapist and a recovered BPD - stay strong, keeping fighting the stigma - sending you positive vibes 💪💕"
BPDSOFFA,foxvpsd,t3_ga2w4p,1588157909.0,"I’m sorry you are going through that. I am a recovered BPD  :) It’s tough to know exactly why she did what she did, though I would assume she did that for several reasons: 1. She misses you and wants you to know it 2. She wants to see how you will respond/ react 3. She wants to be able to see what you are doing on Snapchat 
You know her better than I, which one of those options (if not all) makes the most sense to you? Sending you positive energy 💕"
