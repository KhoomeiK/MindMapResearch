The recipe that i use is:

-8 egg yolks
-130 g grated pecorino romano

Mix the yolks with pecorino and then add 1 or 2 spoons of grease from the guanciale you cooked and 2 spoons of spaghetti boiling water! 
Before draining the pasta make sure to keep some of the water from the pot.

Turn the stove on and put the spaghetti in the pan with guanciale and pour some of the water you kept aside (just a bit THO). Then, turn the heat off and pour the mixture of yolk, percorino, etc.  Make sure you distribute it evenly!
