Take a closer look inside yourself, and break down the negative puzzle but by bit rather than trying to tackle it as a whole. Work on the most nagging issues and the smaller ones will fall into place. Don't worry about the family opinions as you're the one dealing with it not them, you'll need to set them straight about it and if they aren't supportive, then find a group/network that you can comfortably work with."

Everyone will have an opinion about everything, but you have to be able to ignore the spiteful insecurities of others. The people who hurt you this way are acting on their own insecurities, to be the better person, you need to discern yours from theirs. Find like minded people to associate with and turn a deaf ear to the opinion of people who have no bearing in your life. The best voice is your own intuition. The more you associate with people who treat you like that, the more you allow the self negative cycle to continue."

ireland,fpdp34c,t3_gco9a2,1588531384.0,"Public I believe. Its a house for mental health in Drogheda just on on the other side of Peter Street. 

I was referred by the hospital to the highlanes mental health services, who in my opinion were even worse as they accused me of doing morphine (blood tests from hospital showed morphine, which I explained I took a dose of maxilef that morning for pain). From there I was referred to the local house in the town (similar to Pieta in what they do). Then nothing for 2 months, by which time I learned to deal with my issues in my own ways without their help. 

Shame really as I see tons of people who need help and won't reach out due to the lack of response or human interaction."
ireland,fpcj5b7,t3_gco9a2,1588502488.0,"Mental health services aren't helpful around here (Louth). I had a breakdown end of last year and needed help so for the first time, I reached out for help. It took them 2 months just to call me back.

I can understand that most people now need help with the crisis and while I'm doing alright now, there's many others still waiting just be heard. I don't think mental health is taken seriously until a national crisis or local crisis brings the awareness.

I hope your mum finds another way to help as that's just awful and it impacts the workers just as the patients."
