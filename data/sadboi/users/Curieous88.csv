depression,fdq3ju9,t3_emmfkf,1578653137.0,"I appreciate that you want to understand this and I hope you can make amends to your friend.

There's ***persistent depressive disorder*** : There are mild episodes of Sadness, hopelessness and impending doom, sleep disorder and lack of energy  but these episode aren't frequent. If you go by definition of it, It says it occurs at yearly or so but If these occur at monthly period also, would account as PDD not MDD.

But, A person suffering from PDD will not come across as someone who's dealing with depression. Because in this, you still have the motivation and will power to pick yourself up and go through life. 

In my case, I used to tell myself that  it could be an example of ""Duality of being"". It appeared to my family or friends that I had everything under control no matter what the situation, had high emotional endurance and There's nothing I can't fix for them or myself. Everything perfect on the outside yet broken deep inside because you don't understand or accept what you dealing with on the inside. You get up, dress up and show up. Kick ass at work, meet friends and spend time doing things you like doing and yet end up crying yourself to sleep and crying in shower. But, you step outside because you have to make it in the end. 

*I have just one advice for people who feel the same way, Please address it and accept it. It does not make you a weak person, It takes courage to deal with it and do something about it.*

Then, **Major Depressive disorder:** It is highly likely that a person suffering from PDD would get majorly depressed if left untreated. 

Your personality changes. You lose touch with yourself. You don't find anything worth doing or nothing interest you. You feel guilty that you have become this person and you are missing out on work and You aren't good enough anymore and won't be successful, forget successful at this point, you just want to get through life with thoughts of self-harm.

There is no energy left as if someone actually sucked life out of you.  Either you can't get sleep or you just sleep the entire day.

You can't fix your own food and let's say you have your food, you can't eat it without puking( mostly with people who suffer from anxiety disorder). It's difficult getting out of bed and just perform the simple task of brushing. 

You cry for no reason, at all at anytime, anywhere. You see no hope yourself while going through that phase. Death Seems like the only option. But, You don't have the energy to do that also. 

You keep imagining the your death and how relieved you get with that thought.

Your phone rings and you don't pick that up because no energy and you've been constantly crying.

You can't step out of the room or your house because its overwhelming to be around people.

Sunlight or any kind of lights bothers you. Hopelessness, sadness and thoughts of dying are in your head (but you are too chicken to act upon it) and maximum you can do is imagine getting hit by a vehicle while crossing the road to get the sense of relief but for that you'd need to wait for the this episode to pass and step out of the house.

So MDD turned me from being ambitious to barely functional."
