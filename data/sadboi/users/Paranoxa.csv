bipolar,f78cr9e,t3_duu5z7,1573490709.0,WOW it’s crazy how well you can depict emotions through images. I can see the mania in this. It creates a feeling of pure INVINCIBILITY! LOVE IT SO MUCH. 🤩
bipolar,f77e19y,t1_f77c0ob,1573452582.0,You do whatever you feel in your heart. I’m excited to see what you have. :D
bipolar,f76vxbo,t1_f76ti1n,1573437201.0,"That’s beautiful. A touching story. I read even prints you wouldn’t consider because of your stance. I admire that. Thank you for sharing the story. If you ever find yourself posting more, I’m gonna be looking forward to seeing your artwork. :)"
bipolar,f76sohl,t1_f76sfv5,1573434756.0,"I am all the more obsessed with it because of your replies I’ve read about it. The story, the purpose, and especially the dedication to NOT selling it. That was my first thought when I saw it:”how can I get this on MY wall?” To hear that selling it would impact your art from a personal standpoint allowed me to give you all the more respect. Not even money can move an artist if it’s the passion and purpose behind it that they truly care about. Your paintings are museumesque, to say the least. 💖💖💖"
bipolar,f76s8hj,t3_du4o3l,1573434417.0,Just want to say I’m obsessed with this painting.
