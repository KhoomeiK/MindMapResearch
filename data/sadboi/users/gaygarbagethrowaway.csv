Eu apoiei meu amigo a sair com o cara que ele queria e dei conselhos de amigo sobre o desenvolvimento do relacionamento deles, confesso que doeu horrores fazer isso mas vê-lo feliz é tudo pra mim e ele não merece ter menos que 100% da minha amizade por algo que não é culpa dele."

Today we were supposed to have lunch together, I got out of bed and dressed up nicely for the first in the last few days but he had some important stuff to do and went to work without being able to go to our planned lunch. This is hurting a lot in my heart and it’s the first time I’m sad because of something he did.



Don’t get me wrong, I don’t blame him for how I feel at all. He does so much to help me all the time already, I’m really grateful of his friendship.
I just don’t know to stop feeling like that, like he “abandoned” me."
