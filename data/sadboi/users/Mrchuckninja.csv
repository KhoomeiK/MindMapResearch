I’ve already reiterated multiple times that you should ask somebody before rushing up to them, but I think saying you shouldn’t do any of this because of privacy issues is just wrong, and your personal rationalization for why you don’t do it yourself."
Christianity,f09nfg4,t1_f09mo9v,1568504312.0,I’m not sure what authority you have to prevent somebody from living out God’s love in the way they have come to know it?
Christianity,f09lu9x,t1_f09kp3c,1568503710.0,"Never let sin towards you produce sin in you. Never repay a harsh word with a harsh word, but repay a harsh word with a kind word. If they do me wrong, I’ll do them right. Helping those in need, and using that as an opportunity to show God’s love for them. If I feel led to pray for someone, then I’ll pray for them. It’s a lifestyle that once you are with God, and as we imitate God we will become His same love. You are well within your right as a Christian to ask if you can hug on them and pray for them. If they say no that’s fine, you can still pray for them."
Christianity,f09jorg,t1_f09isge,1568502714.0,"Again, these are your personal views, and I’ve said in a previous post you should ask before you do that. There are many people that are encouraged by actions like this. You are free to live Christianity out however you are comfortable doing so, but I am too. Loving your neighbor is more than being nice to them, or doing something nice like Ive said. It’s loving them like God loves you."
TrueChristian,f09jcl1,t1_f09iki5,1568502505.0,"Mostly because of the whole “in this world actions speak louder than words”, which specifically is saying you are viewing this outside of God lol. Somebody can do nice things, and still have a hateful heart? If you are in Christ you are a new creation, and that’s how this person should be seen. Saying they should “have standards” is to say that someone is below those standards, whereas God doesn’t see us that way. Are you seeing the theme here? If God loves us after our life of sin, then why should we use sin as a metric for how good someone is and therefore how compatible they are?"
TrueChristian,f09i2yi,t1_f09hp6b,1568501703.0,"When you live in the world sure, but we are specifically called not to live of the world. We also don’t become a Christian by our works, but by our Faith (heart). You using hyperbole doesn’t suddenly change the scripture."
Christianity,f09hjb2,t1_f09h650,1568501358.0,"Again, you are using hyperbole to prevent Christian’s from living out their Faith because it’s something you are uncomfortable with. We are specifically called to lay our hands on the sick and pray for healing. In our culture hugging someone and telling them God loves them is an expression of love. You have your ways of living that out, but don’t chastise others because they are more comfortable doing so than you are."
TrueChristian,f09h75j,t1_f09gtpm,1568501145.0,"I’m again referring to OPs original post by casting aside a woman because of how she was before giving her life to Christ. That is equal in God’s eyes to lusting after a woman, which based on the specific physical characteristics expected by OP seems to be the case. Again I say, if God doesn’t exclude us for our past sins why should we do that to anyone else?"
TrueChristian,f09gtup,t1_f09g52g,1568500906.0,"You’re again missing the point of this passage, and you just glossed right over the whole ““But now God has shown us a way to be made right with him without keeping the requirements of the law, as was promised in the writings of Moses and the prophets long ago.”
‭‭Romans‬ ‭3:21‬ ‭NLT‬‬
 
part. Paul is teaching that the law should be written on our hearts Romans 2: 12-16. Read. Understand. You’re trying to be legalistic, and that’s not what the New Testament teaches us."
