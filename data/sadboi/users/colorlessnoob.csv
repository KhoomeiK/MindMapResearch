I love jrpgs and I love pokemon and this game mixed them perfectly! It was also worked on by level 5 and the famous studio ghibli which I love all of their anime movies. The story was perfect and the art was amazing, truly a once in a lifetime game and I really hope there will be a real sequel (I dont consider ni no kuni 2 a sequel) long story short the game has perfect graphics, perfect voice acting, and perfect gameplay. Truly the best game I've ever played."
