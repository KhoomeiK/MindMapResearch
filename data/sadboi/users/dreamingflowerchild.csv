TheGirlSurvivalGuide,fffer39,t3_etb2ew,1579882366.0,"Slow fade. I know how hard it can be to appear rude and shut people off so this is a approach that works because you will feel less of an asshole about it. 

Each time he talks to you, keep it short and extremely emotionless, boring, vague.  He sticks around because he feels like there is something to gain from the interaction. Then excuse yourself quickly after a few minutes. Then alternate every other encounter with a fake excuse as to why you have to leave immediately. Eventually increase the frequency of leaving immediately, citing a good excuse. It will become easier for you to sever ties once you get used to it. 

When it comes to online chat it’s the same thing. Keep things boring and vague. Answer chats less and less frequently (leaving unread for a few days) then eventually just never answering. 

Eventually he will become bored and will have to move on. Of course if he’s truly dangerous I would cut things off immediately but I think this method is better than being stuck in a situation where you are unsure of how to act and thus not acting at all."

What has tremendously helped me is having a friend that knows the ins and outs of my illness to a degree in which she knows how it affects me and my limitations. While I think empathy and care is very important, that level of understanding can really show care in a way that makes that person feel heard (especially if the illness is poorly understood). 

During my day to day life I never talk about my illness with others because I know I will get a lot of frustrating comments, questions etc. With her I get a lot of supportive, informative and useful information. She remembers what my illness does to me.

EDS affects connective tissue, primarily the skin, joints, and blood vessel walls. So if you have surgery you might not heal properly and develop severe scarring."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,fcjh3fr,t3_ehi5d0,1577687359.0,"I’m skinny fat, which has a unique problem because not many people take it seriously enough, so I don’t get much encouragement from my SO to keep on track. I still hope what I say can help and be relevant as I believe the science is still the same. 

Here are some things I feel that really move the needle for me in terms of weight loss.

1. Whenever I am craving something absolutely delicious and I really want to have it, I picture eating it. Then I picture eating so much of it that it becomes unappealing (not to the point of disgust, just like you indulged). Usually that kind of ends the craving and I can move on. IF that doesn’t kill the craving, I either eat a very small piece of it, or do a substitute of that food (make a list of substitutes if that helps). For example, if I really crave pizza, I’ll sub for something else tomato based). 

2. Drink lots of water throughout the day. You might not notice results right away but in a few days it will help. Get a really cute water bottle or tumbler so that it encourages you to keep it around you and use it. 

3. Find a photo of you where you were your ideal weight (and looking good helps) and have that as your phone background. It can serve as motivation.

4. I sub some meals sometimes with shakes I make myself. I am not a nutritionist so do your own research. My shakes are made up of frozen fruits, salad, various veggies, protein powder, BCAA supplement and glutamine

5. Don’t ever think “what’s the point of me doing any of this stuff”. There is a point and it does matter. 

6. Learn how to work out properly. There are tons of exercises out there and everyone has different needs but the main things I’ve learned are to make sure to make your core stronger, most exercises can be done at home (and can get you pretty strong), and use proper form. Go easy and build up to working out, you don’t need to go as hard as you can right away if you don’t have the endurance for it. There’s no shame in having your own pace. Stretch your muscles before working out, or else they might not properly activate and you will injure and waste time building no muscle."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,fccwgur,t3_eg75j4,1577603478.0,"I would start with thinking about what you enjoy about being a girl and kind of embody those feelings. I believe being girly in a sense is just as much a state of mind as what you do with yourself. It definitely has to be your personal definition and what you define for yourself. What do you think is considered pretty, beautiful, sexy etc. Write it down if it helps. 

I think being girly is also defined by behavior and maintenance. Men maintain themselves and behave differently from women. Women are generally seen as more “high maintenance”. So think about the types of behaviors you think are something you want to strive for and how you want to maintain yourself. 

Whatever you come up with, be hygienic, confident, and intentional."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,fccs4rp,t3_eh23wt,1577601985.0,Colourpop has some pretty cheap palettes (prices range from $40-15 sometimes $10 dollars if on sale). Since you have sensitive eyes avoid chunky glitter shadows. They are cruelty free and mostly vegan. They list all of their ingredients as well. I love their shadows because they have great color payoff as well.
shoppingaddiction,fc6scgk,t3_eg8beq,1577488245.0,"I think what’s helping me right now is whenever I get the urge to buy something I think of a substitute that I already own.

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,fc3mxy7,t3_efzugh,1577393549.0,"Start using Olaplex if you can. It repairs damaged and broken bonds in the hair that are caused by chemical, thermal, and mechanical damage. They sell various Olaplex products at Sephora but start with no. 3.

Then get a deep conditioning mask that has keratin in it. The one I like is by Hask and sold at Ulta. 

And for keeping your hair smooth, use a hair oil. I like ones with Argan oil in them since they seem to work the best. 

Basically you want to make the hair stronger by reconnecting broken disulphide sulphur bonds in the hair and through replacing damaged keratin."

To acclimate yourself: turn on the machine and wear the mask when you are awake.  Try doing something that takes your mind off of the pressure (reading or watching TV). Do not fight the machine. If you feel like you are suffocating, hold your breath for a few seconds and try breathing again normally. If you try to get more air by inhaling and exhaling too deeply and rapidly your machine will compensate by forcing more air into the tube. Focus on breathing as normally as possible."

Also working out your core and glutes first can really help build your endurance up for other exercise."
shoppingaddiction,f9f50x6,t3_e4s230,1575259731.0,"I think the key really is to set aside money for the things you love and to set a budget so that everything else in your life is accounted for. So in your budget you can have a splurge category. 

Then make an actual list of the things you want. And like what others have mentioned here, go through a criteria on what counts as a meaningful purchase. That way you are focused on what would make you happy. 

When you have enough saved in your splurge category you can reward yourself with something. Space out your purchases too. Set a specific date even if it helps you to look forward to when you can spend. 

I think dealing with a shopping addiction is super hard when it comes to clothes specifically because if you have good taste usually the size you want and style will sell out quickly. So for clothes I specifically tell myself that I won’t buy it right away unless if I know for certain that style of clothing is unique, exactly what I want or won’t ever likely be made again or won’t ever go on sale. Most clothing styles do get remade by a ton of different vendors. There will always be new trends etc so it’s okay to wait until you are more financially free to get the clothes you want. 

For other items, it’s easy to wait until things go on sale or just wait to buy them. 

Also another thing I do after I shop is that I leave the items in the shopping bag for awhile and take the items out slowly and use them. For some reason this psychologically tricks me into thinking the item is brand new. This could be adapted into just caring for your items more and appreciating the joy they give you more so they feel new and exciting."

It sounds like you have everything together and I think you know the discrepancies between you two when it comes to focusing on important priorities. 

He’s condescending to you. I would break up with him and find someone else who treats you as an equal and doesn’t make mundane conversations so tension filled and competitive. Life is short, you are still young and it’s going to be a breath of fresh air being able to interact with someone who you don’t have to worry about who is right. Don’t fall for the sunk cost fallacy. I know 6 years is a lot but you wouldn’t want it to become 7-10 years of misery.

SleepApnea,f5ds253,t3_dnk34y,1572158643.0,"25. All my life I’ve felt constantly tired all the time. No matter much sleep I got I felt drained. Each night it felt not rested like I drank the night before (minus the hangover).  I could barely muster energy to do anything that required a lot of concentration or was boring. I craved sleep so badly that I was performing poorly at work. 

When I got better insurance and more understanding employers I spent the time to get diagnosed. It took about 4 appointments, 3 doctors and two visits with sleep techs to get everything diagnosed, tested and make me compliant. It was so much effort and work but it was worth it. It makes me wish that more people  around me knew what sleep apnea why it’s so important to treat. Lots of people around me just normalized or minimized what it was and it made me internalize those beliefs too. 

The minute I got help my mood improved so dramatically that others noticed. I felt more enjoyment in the day. Everything didn’t feel like a struggle to perform. I was able to process things better. Being well rested is such a good feeling and those without sleep apnea should not take it for granted."
SleepApnea,f5dpyn1,t3_dnkjd8,1572157665.0,"I have an airsense 10 and the following features would help me a lot 

- I am extremely paranoid that my hose is never clean. If there was a way to make sure it stayed air tight but able to be split in half lengthwise or in sections so it can be cleaned would help a lot

- the hose is heavy. It drags my mask down and it makes it hard for me to turn when I sleep. And if it had a hook or something to keep it above my head that would help a lot. But even making the hose lighter would help a lot 

- the humidifier chamber has some crevices that make it hard to dry. I have a dryer but it’s annoying to even have to use that 

- there is just A LOT going on with the cords and hose that it makes a huge mess near my nightstand. I use an  an external humidifier for extra humidity which requires a hose that has its own power source (3 cords going on + hose). It’s messy and an eyesore. A cover makes sense but it’s annoying to remove the cover and reconnect everything when I travel or clean near it. If there were retractable cords it would make the area much neater looking

- not sure if masks are part of it, but having a mask that is a combination of the dream wear full face mask and the amara view it would be the perfect mask. These masks have their good points but one is better for flatter faces and the other is better for shorter noses. Basically a mask that has more options that fit different face profiles.

I just had a few visits with a few doctors that didn’t say anything beyond resting for injuries that weren’t acute injuries. Had I gone to PT sooner I wouldn’t have wasted so much time. I was just using imaging as an example of something going beyond further (although now it makes sense why it’s not always the first form of defense). My injuries had no known direct cause (just happened suddenly) and they didn’t even bother to figure out what was causing and just told me to rest. I think I just hate having to see so many doctors when just a little more in-depth assessment would just help so much.

The ones I considered bad were the ones who told me for knee pain and foot pain to just rest and ice it. They did not order xrays, did not refer me to a specialist or physical therapy or give any other explanations as to what else could cause the issue so I could seek treatment elsewhere.

AskReddit,euetbhn,t1_euepou0,1563753357.0,"Sometimes an ex doesn’t leave your mind because you miss the level of connection you had and you don’t have anything else in your life that replicates that. If you put yourself out there and find a meaningful connection with someone else, that ex will likely have less of a presence in your mind."
AskReddit,euerwdb,t3_cg5ea8,1563752239.0,"You can read all the books in the world and understand everything there is to know about social anxiety but nothing really helps more to dispel unhelpful beliefs is to put yourself out there and get more comfortable in the situations that you are in. That is one piece of it.

The other part is that a lot of what anxiety is rooted in is brain chemistry and nerve sensitivity. That is where therapy and doctors can help."

They might neglect to tell valuable information that could help you make a decision on moving forward.

AskReddit,etiiddy,t3_cbrz9u,1562850918.0,"Fitness should be a lifelong goal. If you let your muscles atrophy too much you can cause some serious mechanical issues in your body. Everything is connected, so weak thigh muscles mean that the other parts of your body might have to compensate more leading to irreversible damage your tendons, foot and knees. 

Do not go for the most intense impact/weight if you haven’t been lifting for a very long time. Your tendons/ligaments need time to get accustomed to the amount of force otherwise you can cause tearing and injury

Your muscles help support the structure of your body, so gaining muscle can help with posture and stability when doing movement.

A lot of the times you won’t see improvement in your glutes because they need to be properly activated. That involves stretching the hip abductors and targeting the area specifically.

Stretch often if you have an office job. The inactivity makes your glutes weak because your body essentially forgets to activate your glutes. 

Do not underestimate the power of physical therapy. a lot of doctors won’t tell you anything useful beyond the common RICE protocol for injury. Seek out a second opinion with someone in sports medicine or physical therapy. 

Probably one of those hardest things to do is having motivation. Sometimes it’s better to do a light workout consistently than to just never going to the gym. Then build up the mental endurance to go harder."

BPD,eps0wp1,t3_bvqmkp,1559434961.0,"We are easy scapegoats because we tend to be unstable and have low self esteem. It’s fucked up and really shouldn’t be like that but those in power choose us as scapegoats and the rest want to be liked by those in power and follow suit. 

It could also be because we tend to be hard to understand. We shut down easily, our personalities change a lot and tend to be inconsistent. In my mind it feels normal but perhaps to outsiders it’s hard to manage. So many changes causes a lot of cognitive dissonance with others and it can be hard to deal with."
