C definitely won't come in handy on a daily basis at all, generally speaking. C# is pretty useful imo. After all, whatever language you choose will teach you different levels of problem solving. 

What kind of programmer are you gonna be if you master C# but don't master C? Well, generally speaking, just a normal programmer. Learning a language just because you think that makes you more ""programmer"" or not is like learning to swim if you're gonna live forever in the middle of a desert. Yep. Stupid. 

Also, spoiler alert, but most likely you're gonna have to learn them all at some point in your life and with some expertise degree. It's nearly impossible to last coding in just one language. Also, mind that it doesn't matter which you picked first at all. If you did learn it well, you're gonna pick the rest quite easily because well, problem solving is the same, just need to pick a new syntax, features, etc."

Also related to funds management. To avoid misspending money and to think more in terms of management rather than of guts or hypotheses I had seen in the market.

Not sure there's a book to ""start trading"". Like, it's not rocket science but neither is it origami. I think you would benefit from reading basic books first. At least an overview of economics and financial theory. I assume you're gonna be trading commodity derivatives, right? 

My recommendation is first read and do exercises of financial maths (simple, compound, continuous interest and all of that) because that's the basis for derivatives valuation, then read about economics like any edition of ""Economics"" by Michael Parkin or any edition of Dornbusch's. Then, ideally, learn about the basic stuff of investments. That could be Understanding investments by Fullenkamp. Then some about corporate finance with Corporate finance by Ross. Then a little bit about fixed income (that'd ease the understanding for curve construction for derivatives valuation imo) with Fixed income handbook by Fabozzi. Later, continue with Options, futures and other derivatives by Hull. After that, you should have a decent and working knowledge of derivatives. For trading commodities I'm not sure of a good recommendation right now because my computer is turned off but maybe I got one or two references and I'll post them on the morning.
