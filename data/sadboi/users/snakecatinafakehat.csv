Embroidery,fny2bv8,t3_g492th,1587351700.0,"This is truly gorgeous! I love the whole vibe of it!

So I know this is probably a silly question but I'm pretty new and can't seem to find an answer on Google. Are these just really long back stitches? Or really short ones? I zoom in and they look like long stitches, but I just want confirmation. I'm trying to figure out how different stitches look on finished pieces"
Anxiety,fn5rulr,t3_fzm0k0,1586673744.0,"I've struggled with this forever but it's super bad now that I'm quarantined without a job. But I found a trick! I made a blanket fort! It wasn't on purpose, I just felt like it and was bored but I noticed after the first day that I was actually relaxed inside of it. I could watch a movie, play video games, whatever. 

It's not super feasible all the time, but it's working for me right now."
mysticmessenger,fn5r4z6,t1_fn5n0yr,1586673079.0,"Dude, same. That didn't feel right either to me either. 

Even with an irk or two I still cried and felt it was super good overall"
GreenWitch,fn0krqm,t1_fn04mru,1586543751.0,"There aren't really any good studies yet(since this whole thing is so new) but one of the reasons elderberry is good for you is because it helps produce more cytokine in your body. It's theorized that this could lead to a worse cytokine storm seeing as there's already more cytokine in the first place.

Again, the studies are mostly theory right now, but it's just like how they're saying not to take Ibuprofen right now either. It could make it a lot worse or not effect it at all. Either way it's probably a good idea to be careful with it."
GreenWitch,fmzfkce,t3_fybqvn,1586518675.0,"Hi! I know this post isn't specifically talking about it, but I  just wanted to let you know that there is some talk in the medical community that immune boosting herbs can actually make COVID-19 more active in the body. I've heard talk specifically of elderberry making Covid worse if you catch it. It makes it harder to catch, but it gives it something to latch onto if you do get it."
Bento,fj5tuqe,t1_fj3hl0t,1583042909.0,"Oooo, that sounds really yummy! I'm seeing that variety really is what's most important. Also, I adore bulgogi! Did you make it yourself? 

Thanks! I'm honestly really proud and excited to put effort into lunch"
PetAdvice,fim4tjl,t3_f8lbak,1582518180.0,"My kitty is about the same age and has IBS. We switched her food which helped a little but the saving grace was Cerenia, which is an anti nausea pill. I give her a low dose of it every other day and it has helped both her quality of life as well as mine. It wasn't terribly expensive, if I remember right.

Best of luck to you and your kitty!"
KDRAMA,fhgpt4w,t3_f2v73z,1581574461.0,"The first thing I did was read what you thought of Heirs to see if we have similar taste then immediately saved this post haha I'm always looking for new stuff!

I don't know if you want recommendations but I don't see this one mentioned: Uncontrollably Fond. The actor who played the antagonist rival in Heirs is the lead and it is one of my all time favorites. I've never gotten as emotional for a show as that one. 

I can't wait to watch more of what's on your list! I'm almost done with Heirs and will need something new soon."
mycology,ffzvdhp,t1_ffz493h,1580393890.0,"Tbh I didn't, I got one of those easy to grow kits for Christmas and decided to give it a go. Clearly I'm uneducated on it based on my mistake. I'd appreciate it if you helped me instead of attacking me over it. 

I'm new, I didn't do much research before hand. That's my fault. Now I'm trying to learn. Please be kind instead of snarky."
AmItheAsshole,fcciw1r,t1_fcbl84l,1577598906.0,I once worked at a restaurant that had a regular couple who always brought one of these dolls in a stroller. I ended up looking into the stroller without being warned and that was THE CREEPIEST experience of my life. I'm sure my face shifted but they just smiled at me and the doll before going back to eating like they didn't have a plastic nightmare next to the table
Pets,fc9aomq,t1_fc6jzh6,1577549741.0,So I got the insurance when my cat was 10 so it's higher than if I had gotten it when she was younger. It's $55 a month. And they got through the claims for her surgery pretty quickly (not instantly but within a month or so) and they didn't try to deny anything. I've only done the one claim but the process was pretty easy and stress free.
Pets,fc4pvcq,t1_fc3sht9,1577424153.0,I have the ASPCA insurance
Pets,fc3p9fg,t1_fc3ia73,1577395214.0,I just want to second this. My cat had a $6000 surgery a few months back and insurance paid for about $5000 of it. I know I would go into debt for this cat so I made sure I won't have to.
Pets,fa30k1q,t1_f9x5p6x,1575789039.0,"The vet is hoping the anemia might be from her hyperthyroid pills and will reverse if we lower the dose. She already seems a little more spry than before. I'm sorry about your cat. I'm hoping I can manage it and get just a little more time. Thank you though, I guess I needed to be reminded to just not freak out yet."
Pets,fa300u4,t1_f9y9idj,1575788844.0,"I'm happy your kitty is still holding on ♥️ I'm hoping my kitty will do the same. I'm feelings way less hopeless now and I appreciate your comment a lot. I'll look into that more when she gets closer to that point. Thank you though, I wouldn't have thought to ask that otherwise."
Pets,fa2z6en,t1_f9zmrvg,1575788634.0,"Thank you so much for this comment. I really feel more hopeful about the whole thing now. I'm still processing the emotions right now, but this really helps so much. Thank you ♥️"
Pets,fa2yvhr,t1_f9yk95b,1575788533.0,"Thank you so much, this makes me feel a lot better. It feels like such a final thing, but your comment makes me more hopeful. The vet had already talked about doing that at home but I guess right now they want to do more tests and lower get HT meds and see what happens. Again, thank you ♥️"
PetAdvice,f3wckxf,t3_digb04,1571197829.0,"Honestly, I would highly recommend a vet visit. In my personal experience, a sudden personality shift-good or bad- can mean underlying problems. If you can't pin point any environmental cause for this I'd get him a check up. A Vet should also be able to help you bond with him, if there are no health issues."
AskVet,f339t1o,t1_f32gv10,1570634516.0,"I just hold her when I've pulled her directly. She refuses to eat anything right now aside from her dry food. She handles directly pilling well enough (she sulks about it and will spit it out sometimes) but she won't eat anything after and a thing I was reading said it's dangerous for them to dry pill. 

The vet said the pills are super bitter so I should always make sure she can't taste it, which I do. I tried just getting her to eat the pill itself for the first time and that didn't work either."
Old_Recipes,ezc0ant,t1_ez6alx5,1567827942.0,"I did. I think my issue was I added the butter too early. It felt room temperature at the bottom the the bowl,but I don't think the middle was. The butter may have melted a little and made it a little broken. Still tasty! Just not as pretty and a little too buttery"

PetAdvice,ercong7,t3_c17q01,1560717788.0,"You can get wall plug ins that are like the scent plug ins, but it has a hormone that calms cats in it. It helped my cat a lot. Also, my cat got better once I gave her a cat tree with places she could hide in. Plus, I never bothered her on it so it was a spot just for her."
PetAdvice,eqxfi6e,t3_bymxcn,1560368616.0,"My kitty has always been picky about her litter box and not only needs a big one, but also needs lots of space. When I used a covered box, she wouldn't even go inside to do her deeds.

Looking at your picture, I see your litter box is next to a wall on at least one side, maybe two. Maybe that's the issue? She could be trying to pee out in the open and the wall is making her feel cramped. I'd also suggest cleaning any carpets or matting around the box so it doesn't smell like pee anymore and that might help."
