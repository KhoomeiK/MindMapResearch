ftm,fj2e0hu,t1_fj2dxw1,1582941259.0,Well that didn‚Äôt make me feel bad at all lol
ftm,fj2dp92,t1_fj2dljk,1582941027.0,I do care a little. My name gives me a lot of pride because it‚Äôs the male version of the name but still it‚Äôs gender neutral and it reminds me of feeling like a girl because of being called that my whole life.
ftm,fj2dlji,t1_fj2d8jr,1582940951.0,Nice I like it because of LOST

ftm,firbk1h,t1_fiqxx2t,1582661214.0,I‚Äôll remember to update you lol I‚Äôll put a reminder on my phone. So far this week instead of crying every day I cried like 3 days but it varies some weeks anyway.
TouchThaFishy,fiquxs8,t1_fiqtftj,1582652139.0,So sweet

ftm,fiq9h5f,t1_fipvbdy,1582638921.0,Good point af
ftm,fiq9csw,t3_f96z0x,1582638829.0,I‚Äôm on T as of last week and I feel this way even though I knew when I was 4. It‚Äôs hard to view yourself outside of what you‚Äôre conditioned to understand what you are. I found drawing myself naturally without planning first really helps. I always naturally draw myself as a guy and it‚Äôs nice to know at least my subconscious sees it even when I can‚Äôt visualize it or wrap my head around it usually.
ftm,fiq8wvc,t1_fiq8e3p,1582638489.0,Better safe than sorry lol. What you said made it look 100% like that‚Äôs a girl. Not arguing with you btw your comment was helpful.
ftm,fiq8suz,t3_f98nig,1582638407.0,For the record I cry about everything always. Emotions are not meant to be kept inside. The fact that you can‚Äôt talk about it without crying says something about how many feels you got inside you man. Let them out! It isn‚Äôt weak :) I couldn‚Äôt even talk about dysphoria whatsoever when I was in denial because it made me wanna die. This seems totally normal to me and I‚Äôm proud of you :) keep moving forward in whatever way is safe and helpful to you.
ftm,fiq8eq6,t1_fipzvhg,1582638104.0,"It‚Äôs hella fucking scary being vulnerable. But being vulnerable requires a lot more strength than pretending nothing is wrong! Tbh it‚Äôs hella manly lol.

ftm,fiq7c0d,t3_f99ccq,1582637235.0,Haha I used to call them boobs when I was in denial and it was legit like self harm. Now I can‚Äôt even bring myself to call it anything other than my chest or ‚Äúthis‚Äù.

mildlyinteresting,fiq6zqv,t3_f999rj,1582636963.0,How did it end up so big!? I saw the pic of your hand in the comments it‚Äôs small lol.
TouchThaFishy,fipidxk,t1_fh6v1ar,1582607870.0,My old cat used to do this to me and my bf every night to go to sleep. Idky because she was with her mom so long she didn‚Äôt even need to eat from her anymore.
sticknpokes,finwhpm,t3_f8se1v,1582571579.0,It does look great. If you really want to fix it maybe add some to the left eye to make it like the other pupil.
RadicalChristianity,fin8ech,t3_f5u3du,1582558154.0,Definitely. I was raised Catholic and we went to church every Sunday but the rest of the week was back to me being alone and uncared for. Forced to follow something no one bothered to explain or represent to me.
tifu,fin7pyd,t3_f8soo7,1582557721.0,Lol my stepmoms cat would walk around fluffing his tail cuz he knew he was cute. He fluffed it into a fucking candle one time and his tail was on fire and he didn‚Äôt even care.

asktransgender,fijzirt,t3_f81g8n,1582468859.0,I didn‚Äôt experience this. I‚Äôve had plenty of relationships but every single one was a fail and tbh I blame my anger and discomfort with how I was treated in the relationship (as a female). It became such a huge problem in one relationship I broke up with him. If I had the emotional ability to stop myself from getting in relationships however I would never have dated anyone. It caused too much discomfort and confusion for me (lol cuz I was dating a bunch of straight guys).
graffhelp,fiiof6m,t1_fi3yuh0,1582423939.0,Hell no it‚Äôs nice confusing.

GenderCritical,fhszv9c,t1_fhsym0r,1581867987.0,"Idk what that means. It just wasn‚Äôt a hypothetical situation and I genuinely, simply, ONLY wanted an opinion on it. I didn‚Äôt come to argue with anyone. Just reading and had a simple question of someone‚Äôs opinion on a certain situation."
GenderCritical,fhsyjm7,t1_fhsybjc,1581867380.0,"I didn‚Äôt pretend anything I asked a question.

ftm,fhrcd7e,t1_fhrajml,1581822714.0,Nice I like Ryan. My family didn‚Äôt have an alternate name for me. I used to call myself a bunch of things when I was younger but never seriously. I used to like the fact that Skyler has Kyle in it but I don‚Äôt wanna be called Kyle.
ftm,fhrbzuh,t1_fhr7zvt,1581822446.0,Thanks I‚Äôll ll try to find some people lol
ftm,fhr7e4j,t1_fhr69ew,1581819329.0,Unfortunately I made the mistake of telling everyone that I want to keep my name. I feel silly trying to change it. Also I like Sawyer but no one calls me Sawyer so idk how it feels lol
ftm,fhr5p9h,t1_fhr481m,1581818049.0,Must be weird to be a mom. Glad you have a good relationship now dude :)
ftm,fhr4tej,t1_fhr3xrg,1581817382.0,I like that name it‚Äôs pretty cool. I‚Äôm having issues because I never allowed myself to think about this stuff until a couple months ago at freaking 21 after 12 years of repression and heavy denial. I have no clue what name I want it‚Äôs so foreign.
ftm,fhr3j2h,t1_fhr1jtq,1581816411.0,Haha my mom named me. She was 15. I actually think part of my problem is she doesn‚Äôt accept me and called me toxic and cut me out of her life.
ftm,fhr3ecz,t1_fhr2mz7,1581816313.0,I feel the same about the misgendering part. I have been going back and forth between finding comfort in the reasons I‚Äôm happy with my name and finding discomfort in being called my name.

ftm,fhqppr0,t3_f4h9gv,1581808456.0,Don‚Äôt worry dude everything is within grasp now üíô keep on their asses if they don‚Äôt follow through
ftm,fhqoqal,t3_f4fg00,1581807833.0,I feel the same. Especially with my family which is ridiculous but still I just can‚Äôt do it. I mainly am just waiting until people don‚Äôt do it anymore naturally. I don‚Äôt want to be super vocal about this or demand people change what they call me when I won‚Äôt see them forever. Idky I just can‚Äôt do it. Can relate to wanting to disappear completely.
