I got off the pill and got the copper iud and it did wonders. The copper one ended up not being the right fit (literally my doctor said my uterus was too “curvy” for the iud to stay in place lol) so I went with a hormonal iud bc they’re a bit bigger and tend to stay in place better. Even with the hormones, the dose in an iud is wayyyy lower than the pill. I’ve had the hormonal iud a little over a year now and it’s working really well for me! I hope that helps.

I’ve been working with my meds and therapy and it’s done wonders. What I’m saying is I totally get the frustration, hopelessness, annoyance, etc. but if you keep working on it, you’ll be able to come to an understanding that, yeah this is your life, but it’s not that bad, because with medication

bipolar,f167kr5,t3_d7wur5,1569204552.0,"I really feel this. I’ve been hypomanic for about a month and have probably had sex with ten people. Especially in the world of tinder/bumble it makes it so easy to indulge impulse. 

Specifically, two weeks ago I went out with a guy (thinking dinner and drinks) and we didn’t get dinner (I got hangry hellooooo feed me) but he got me really drunk. He stopped drinking but kept ordering for me. I blacked out and the next thing I knew he was sexually assaulting me in his car. But in my mind I was like well my hypomanic ass put myself out here by going on the date, etc. 

Still aside from that, I seek so much reckless sex when I’m hypomanic. It’s really a problem. Then I have people hitting me up later on, when I’m out of my episode, and sometimes I don’t know how to say no....it’s a whole thing, I’m sure you can tell.

I’ve been off my meds before because I couldn’t get them for any number of reasons....it’s been because I was traveling and ran out unexpectedly but couldn’t get a refill at a Walgreens in a different state. Or because I really just lost/misplaced my bottle but it was too early to get a new prescription but I couldn’t contact my psych to clear it up in the meantime. In other words, a lot of people control your meds before they get to you, so if you can’t get them without being on the phone for 24 hours straight I totally get that and I’m sorry. If you can get them and it just takes a little extra work then GET YOUR MEDS FAM!!!!!!!

Instead, every time I went she would add something else. Didn’t listen to anything I said. I ended up going to a different psych but man that pissed me off so much.
