**The heritage places**   
\-A'famosa , ST Paul Church,  The Stadthuys/Bagunan Merah etc.  
**The malls**   
\-Dataran Pahlawan and Mahkota Parade is the place if you're in the town area. Other mall around the town can be suck.  
**The food**   
\-Pak Putra (Their Cheese nan and tandoori is so damn good),  Hajjah Mona Asam Pedas (If you're into spicy food), Cendol kampung hulu etc..  
\-I don't have a list for good chinese/indian food but you can try to ask the local.  


**Night Market**  
\-Highly recommended that you go to Jonker Street (only open on weekend)  
**Good places for the view**   
\-Melaka City's River. The view is nice especially at night. You can take a ""Melaka River cruise"" if you're not into walking."

Came to seller house to test ride. Agree on buying it.

We both went to JPJ office to change the ownership. Fill up the form (buyer and seller), go to the counter and the seller will give his motor grant to the officer and proceed with the ownership change. The office will give you the new motor grant for the buyer.

I hand him the seller the money , he hand me the key. I renew my road-tax and insurance and ride it.

No puspakom inpesction needed for motor btw. (unless you have doubt on the motor , you can always check with puspakom first)"
