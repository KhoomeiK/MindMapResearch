Persona5,foziq1q,t1_fozgzmk,1588191331.0,"His plan was intentionally flawed, the devs made it that way for a reason. All he wanted to do was destroy shido at his apex moment, and overcome Joker. He’s portrayed as a hotheaded sociopath that is so stuck up in his goal, that he forgot how to accomplish it. He let himself be manipulated because he didn’t fully understand the scope of the situation, he failed to consider that shido would probably get rid of him too, even if he is a valuable asset to him. This is probably because no one other than akechi has this power who was on Shido’s side. I’ve seen this argument about how “he’s forgiven and redeemed for his actions” and I fail to understand this perspective, it seems so basic to me. He’s portrayed as an absolute lunatic whom you’re forced to cooperate with, not some heartthrob. He even tries to 
turn himself in at the end of royal, only to be released thanks to “the good doctor’s actions”. He’s released because “the good doctor” wishes for him to be happy too, because he believes everyone can have redemption. His “death” isn’t supposed to be redemption, it’s supposed to be a sad end to a teenager who was manipulated his entire life, and struggled to face it all alone. Also, his circumstances is what probably made him that way, he didn’t just kill for killing’s sake. I’m sorry but that argument makes no sense to me"

Persona5,fozgohz,t1_foz967b,1588190353.0,"Lol imma have to disagree with you on that. There are only small hints throughout the early game foreshadowing akechi’s possible involvement. He’s a struggling teenager who’s been manipulated most of his life, before finally cracking and losing it. He is the opposite of a poorly made character, and has more personality than a lot of other confidants.
