UnsentLetters,fq5h3ua,t3_ggtql4,1589105182.0,One of the best letters I've read here. Well-written and meaningful. Glad for you that you got to experience this and to grow from it.
UnsentLetters,fejiwry,t1_fejii3d,1579176215.0,"What? Well you expect your partner to respect you and your limits. Clearly she didn’t want him to do that, for whatever reason she had - AND she asked him 2 times, but instead he chose to ignore her words and still went ahead. That’s horrible."
roadtrip,fdq0kqk,t1_fdp8sy8,1578648895.0,Nagano Prefecture? Could you give a more detailed location? I'm planning a trip in that region :)
Fashion_Design,fdd3un3,t3_ekig1j,1578293667.0,These are great! Love the two in the center the most :)
travel,f8p5f4l,t3_e1ckk6,1574695962.0,Looks great! Was is safe to travel around the city? No problems at the airport?
mentalhealth,f6yrohe,t3_dtmqje,1573293430.0,"What a tumultuous life. You went through so much but here you stand now, still going and still fighting. I wish you all the best in this new decade opening to you, despite what people might think, 40 years old is a great age to start anew ⭐️ Happy birthday!"
dating_advice,f5wzi1j,t1_f5vzav9,1572533074.0,I’m not sure you’re expecting too much though? Who would keep on dating someone who has no basic conversational skills? Being able to have chats about a variety of current topics certainly doesn’t sound like a crazy expectation I’d say!
