So now I'm stuck on update 3.01. and the software says like version 0.0 on the ultimate app thing. Kinda afraid to touch the updater now. The controller works the way I need it to but it just sucks I can't update it."
ShoulderInjuries,fr36zqy,t3_ej58ja,1589851211.0,"How has surgery gone for you? I think I likely have internal impingement because I have practically all the symptoms. Posterior shoulder pain, scapular winging. My MRI found a 50% subscapulararis and supraspinatus tear. I'm a swimmer so this just pisses me off and effects my whole outlook more. From what I can gather the deltoid muscle is over working and is essentially pulling up the humerous into the suprispinatus tendon. Which is what causes that fraying rope like effect, hence tendonitis, tears etc.

 From everything I've read and talked with my docs. It's heavily argued on how to properly treat the issue. Dry needling seemed to work on me temporarily for like 2 days. I think because it forced my deltoid to stop overworking so when ever I moved my arm over head for the first time in 3 months it felt normal. But then it just started getting worse again."

But like it wasn't super painful it really only hurt for the first 2 days. My family was just thinking cuz I can still walk on it fine I'm ok just don't run or do anything to aggravate it. I icced or the first 3 days. But now still when j try to even jog it does not feel good.

It has the same durability as the 2nd tier upgrade equipment."
AnimalCrossing,foppkle,t3_g8kods,1587968091.0,I think I may have the unpopular opinion but I'm pretty much fine with the way the durability system works. The whole point of it is to push you to buy stuff from nooks cranny. cuz like if you get all the golden tools and they all have infinite durability it makes a significant part of what nooks cranny sells pointless. Plus I like the look of the outdoorsy equipment they sell.

She did teach me how it felt to care about someone and love. She was my first ever relationship. I think I did love her

But there were just things I couldn't accept

She end up stringing along one my friends at the time. Which also drove me crazy and jealous.

Eventually when I argued for a break to think things through because I wanted to make things work and I didn't think they were such huge problems.

She ended it. She said ""you may be the perfect guy for me, but I'm not the perfect girl for you"". She then started screwing with my friend like 3 days later.

I don't particularly remember a lot of barbell exercises but I do think you can substitute barbell exercises for a bunch of the exercises in there. Some of the phases have you perform sets and reps in different ways i.e retro rep training.

It hurt for so damn long,in a way it still hurts. It's hard to find the right person in college especially when everyone is so afraid of commitment. But the most important thing that I've learned is how to support myself. Nobody owes you anything, and you don't owe anyone anything. Be that strong person and you will be able to attract the right people into your life.

Don't rely on other people to make your life better, rely on yourself. Everyone has capability to find happiness, don't let 1 person take that away from you."
