Reminders/triggers for both situation cause me to stare straight ahead,  freeze, forget where I am, start shaking uncontrollably, can't make eye contact, feel like crying, have abdominal pain, and feel like I'm about to vomit. My sexual assault triggers seem more insidious, they can sneak up on me and fuck me up for days or longer, and I might not even connect the dots. My flight triggers are acute. I feel them coming on whenever I tell people about the bad flight I had (like, sharing scary flight stories for fun even), or if I watch a tv show with a turbulent flight (even the Key and Peele skit). It doesn't get me on as deep of a level, but it's physically paralysing until it goes away (usually a few hours). If I'm actually flying, I basically am in a constant state of hypervigilence, if not outright panic from 24 hours before the flight itself until the fight ends and I'm back on the ground. I have nightmares about both experiences, hypervigilence tied to both experiences, re-experiencing, intrusive thoughts, body memories, etc, but I don't feel a sense of personal shame or anger about the flight, the way I do about the assault.
