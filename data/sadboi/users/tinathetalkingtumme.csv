introvert,fr39wg1,t3_glyw9u,1589852907.0,Omg I’m glad someone is sharing this. I get even more anxious being online vs real life. I’m just not ok with myself being on screen for anyone to see plus having to speak. My class makes us turn on video and mic unfortunately

depression,fqq92yh,t3_gk067l,1589561483.0,"A virtual hug 🤧🤗🥺let us remember that our current situation is temporary and is not the rest of our life. This quarantine situation, throws everything up in the air. We are being forced to sit with ourselves in all our glory but mostly glumness... it’s an opportunity to get to know yourself a bit more. I for one didn’t realise how much I relied on going out as a distraction... among other things 

How about yourself ? 

Like you, I’m finding it very challenging to manage my depression and i can’t offer any solace for this other than you’re not alone and it’s ok not to be ok.  Wishing you better days, and if you ever need someone to talk to, can message me on here ❤️"

SkincareAddiction,fnvzomf,t1_fjx94qj,1587308414.0,Did it work ?? Asking for myself lol
Rosacea,fnuip82,t3_g3u132,1587263027.0,"I stand by the product, I found it useful in managing active pimples redness on my cheeks and texture problems (I’ve been using for 2 years) 

But the texture is really annoying ! It’s very sticky and grainy and the smell is strange. I use it as a spot treatment. 

After I use it, I use two moisturisers and a serum because it is quite drying ! 

It’s not a moisturiser it’s more of a drying mask"
xxfitness,fnuiadl,t3_g3jpzx,1587262746.0,I HATE sweating in my house. That’s literally it lol
AskWomen,fnqsm28,t3_g34y3g,1587171336.0,"I pause. Think about what I want to say and then if I decide to speak, I speak slower and in a neutral tone. I work with children, and I use this same technique when I am losing patience. Partner can tell I’m losing my chill because my words are more articulated lol but that’s the only sign haha 

When I was younger some of my anger was based on assumptions. I’m in the habit of asking more questions now. “What do you mean by that ?” “So are you saying that ___” 

You might find that your anger is misinformed. 

Summary: 
1. pause 
2. You can be quiet and angry - yelling doesn’t make your anger more valid ! Remain poised (try to) 
3. Slow down. 
4.challenge your anger 
5. Withdraw from the situation (if you can) return when you are ready to have a discussion not fuelled by anger.

This works for me, may not work for you :) I do really think slowing down has been most helpful for me! Try it."
dating_advice,flf39ui,t3_fo43xi,1585097086.0,"Hmm I mean what if you never end up ‘ok’? Does that mean that you didn’t try hard enough? 
I also feel that letting someone love you is an act of self love. 

As someone with depression, it’s difficult to see that happening especially when I have momentary periods of ‘happy’ and then slumps of unexplained sadness. 

I am actually following your approach. I  have accepted that I may never be ok but at least I won’t make somebody else not ok. 

Whatever ok means

Even when I write this though I feel like I’m hurting myself. Cause I have the capacity to recognise these drawbacks in my myself but I haven’t successfully overcome them. Yet. There is no guarantee either. That’s the part that hurts the most."

audiology,fiq8drv,t3_f8sfit,1582638084.0,"Are you experiencing any other symptoms? 

There’s a variety diagnostics tests and results collected from the audiologist that can assist and/or warrant a referral to the ENT or  
Physical therapy. 

If you saw the ENT first, they may refer you to audiology(vestibular diagnostics) to first rule out any issues of the balance organs of the inner ear, hearing etc 
 
However, it’s hard to say whom you should see first with only that one symptom provided."

not having to wear clothes. Much less laundry. I also like the quiet and space and the fact that no one is going to pinch my snacks. I don’t have to pointlessly label my food."

SkincareAddiction,filpuht,t3_f8ctit,1582507423.0,"I used avene skin recovery cream for a while becuase I couldn’t find anything else that my skin tolerated. However, i just felt like it was moisturising the surface and was just sitting on the top layer of my skin?

Anyway I got a sample of kiehls ultra facial cream and I noticed a significant difference in the texture, complexion and glow from my skin. I’d even say it has helped improve the redness on my skin as wel. 

Moral of the story: grab a sample of kiehls ultra facial cream and see if it works for you as it did for me !"
