If you want to show others why they should not follow Trumps lead, show the way, act mature, and make worthwhile contributions to the world. If you’re just going to complain and complain and not do anything, you’re no better off than him. Why would he listen to someone who doesn’t say anything constructive?

Quick question: I was looking into the ResMed Airsense 10 AutoSet for Her, and noticed that there is also a regular, not for her version. The not for her version says that you can use an app with it to read sleep data. Do you know if you can do that with the for Her version too? It didn't appear like it did have the app when I looked on the features tab, in which case I might want to go with the regular version, however, if it does have the app, I'd definitely go for the for Her version.

mentalhealth,fnzzmae,t3_g4oucf,1587403508.0,"What really frustrates me with doctors, that I've dealt with a bunch in my life: you know your body better than anyone else. If you know you have anxiety, and you know how your anxiety affects you, and you then have other symptoms that you know are more than your anxiety, and they blame it on your anxiety, without doing other tests, that's not okay. More than anything, doctors need to LISTEN to their patients! We have lived with our bodies our whole lives! We have an intuition that something is wrong, and that's often just written off as depression or anxiety. I would say that in a lot of cases, yes, you can be suffering from depression and or anxiety, but in a lot of cases, there could be something additional, or it could be something completely different. It's even worse when tests don't necessarily show what you have, and they come back normal, meanwhile, you know there is something wrong, and you can sense that it's different than what you normally experience. There are quite a few conditions that can't be proven on tests alone. A lack of diagnosis and treatment can kill people, and does quite often."
