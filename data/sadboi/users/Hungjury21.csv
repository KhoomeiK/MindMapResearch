confessions,fqcnydk,t3_gi3e26,1589263436.0,"I agree, and I say that as a mentally ill person. If you have any kind of serious disability, and there is a high likelihood that you will pass it down to your children, you shouldn't have kids, regardless of the nature of the disability, whether it's mental or physical. This is the reason why I will never have children."
schizoaffective,fq7slfb,t3_gh46hr,1589151357.0,"No, but I remember when I was in the hospital there were like two other people there whose voices told them not to eat, so they wouldn't eat. One of them was like, skinny as hell."
schizoaffective,fq7shdz,t3_ggwyi4,1589151292.0,"Haha, yeah...I smoked cigarettes for like 3.5 years, quit cold turkey for 9 months, then started vaping. I stopped vaping and switched to zyn nicotine pouches because of COVID, but as soon as this is over I'll probably go right back."
schizoaffective,fpwrasy,t1_fptp8ev,1588968534.0,"Interesting, I never realized that. I guess I have some other mild compulsive habits, like for example when I'm driving I periodically check to make sure that the parking brake is off even though I know it is. Also my headlights, if it's dark I keep checking to make sure they're on, if it's daytime out I keep checking to make sure they're off. I'm also pretty sure my mom has mild OCD, whenever we'd leave the house she always says that she thinks she left the stove on, and we'd have to go back, but then of course it was never on. More recently I had been checking for her and reassuring her that the stove was off, and that seems to have helped."

aspergers,fj2xi8a,t1_fizy2y3,1582957639.0,"I mean like, when I'm talking to someone, I'm not connecting with them. Nothing's happening, I don't feel anything, usually. I feel like other people get a sense of pleasure out of it, but not me. I see people making friends with each other all the time, but for me it just isn't there. I mean, there's very few people who I connect with. I just usually get bored talking to people and I go back inside my own head where everything's a lot more interesting and exciting. I wish I could enjoy the real world more, but I feel like reality is boring and I'm constantly escaping from it."
Psychosis,ff2isqg,t3_er91sv,1579508009.0,"I would recommend not telling them that you're cutting yourself, that could get you committed again. Try to tone it down and feed them small bits of information piece by piece over multiple sessions so that they can get to know you. Make more generalized statements like, ""i've been feeling kind of paranoid lately"" rather than the specific statements you made in this post. 

As someone who's been 5150'd myself, I know it's not fun and I know it sucks to need help and be too afraid to get it. I wish you well, hopefully this helps."

schizoaffective,f5jlnvo,t3_dnxcd0,1572232087.0,"It looks good overall. 

There are just a few minor spelling errors here and there. Under cognitive it says ""difficulty exressing thoughts"" instead of difficult expressing thoughts. 

Under Negative I think you spelled tactile as tactal

Where it says ""speech that lacks content there"" it may be easier to say ""speech that lacks content"" I don't see what the ""there"" does. 

Stabilizer is misspelled under the ""is it possible to live well with Schizophrenia"" module

Besides that, looks good!"

Schizotypal,evmut0i,t3_ckeufs,1564613740.0,No. You and everyone else still has a moral compass and a sense of right and wrong. Being mentally ill does not make you dangerous or a bad person. We all still have the capacity to reason and make good decisions.
