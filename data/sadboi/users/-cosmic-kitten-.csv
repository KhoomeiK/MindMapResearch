He replied that he wasn't looking for a relationship yet so I was like um okay cool and just kept it causal. He ended up becoming really distant and I just left him. Few weeks later he updates his Facebook with a new relationship! I was hurt ofc but at the end of the day he clearly didn't want to be with me and only wanted sex. I worked on myself and found a guy that did want to be with me (after literally 2 dates he asked for it to be official). The problem is him, not you.

SkincareAddictionUK,fpdlt57,t3_gctpbs,1588529520.0,"I used to get very red cheeks then I got properly into skincare (instead of just using random things from Superdrug etc.). I believe TO's Zinc & Niacinamide is the main thing that's helped as it's the only thing in my routine that I've kept consistent. However I did also start using Cerave cream and TO's Sqaulane cleanser and they are obviously rave products. Keeping it simple is key here! No fragrance, harsh exfoliation etc. Oh and on that subject I only use TO's AHA Peeling Solution to exfoliate once a week. Hope this helps!"
