Teenagers are at that stage in life where they think know best. The OP comes across as being discriminatory maybe thatâ€™s just to the shear panic of having to take her child to get tested. She needs to have a proper sit down with him and properly communicate her reasons with him so he understands so he doesnâ€™t fall out with over this.
AmItheAsshole,f4926sp,t1_f491lfo,1571455221.0,My point is if you tell a 16 year old to not do something theyâ€™re more likely to sneak round behind your back. He could also start to resent you for keeping him apart from the guy wants to be with. Maybe you should sit down and talk this through with him and give him reasons so heâ€™s doesnâ€™t think your just discriminating and being ignorant

I understand not wanting to fail I didnâ€™t realise how strict/ difficult uni was in the US cause in the UK I donâ€™t think theyâ€™d fail you for that. You could try keeping a mood dairy?

AmItheAsshole,f48ut74,t3_djx3t3,1571449503.0,NAH itâ€™s clear you only want the best for your son. Iâ€™m not a parent myself and not from the US but can you request she only get supervised visits with your son? To help ease your anxiety for when sheâ€™s around him
BipolarReddit,f48tixp,t3_djx31p,1571448473.0,Stopping your meds all of a sudden is never a good idea even if the mania is a side effect of your meds then you should see a psychiatrist cause you donâ€™t want the mania to get worse. In my experience I never notice a mania episode because I feel good etc but you donâ€™t want it to go to an extreme where you end up in hospital.

Hmm you have a point. it comes across as difficult to me cause she agreed to meet a possible new tenant and went along with ads etc & then went back on it but maybe she just had a change of heart after thinking about it.
AmItheAsshole,f48htj8,t3_djv5vb,1571439497.0,NAH though if she does change her name you should call her by her preferred name. Your right changing her name wonâ€™t solve all her problems. Sheâ€™s also right as a white person you have no idea the kind of discrimination/ racism sheâ€™s faced and itâ€™s probably affected her a great deal which is understandable because people are horrible. I hope she can find a therapist to talk to who can help her with her self esteem etc. Because she deserves to feel beautiful. Wish you both the best OP.
AmItheAsshole,f48h9d9,t3_djv661,1571439212.0,ESH because your comment was harsh but I understand why you said it.

AmItheAsshole,f48etna,t3_djusro,1571437500.0,NTA there is nothing wrong with the amount of time your spending with your loved ones.

Just have a convo with her and explain your views.
AmItheAsshole,f4839d6,t1_f482tk0,1571431840.0,Well in the majority of situations it does. Thatâ€™s nice that someone was willingly to swap however itâ€™s the airlines issue to sit a child with the parents not a random person on a plane he shouldnâ€™t feel guilty for not giving up a seat heâ€™s paid for.
