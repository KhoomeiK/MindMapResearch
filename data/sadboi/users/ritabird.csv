You dont have to divorce or annul just yet but stay gone and make a plan for yourself and your baby. 30 years ago I was naive to the beginning signs of abuse and I stayed. I became numb to the abuse and accepted it as normal. I stayed for 8 years and it fucked up one of my children so bad he committed suicide last year. STAY GONE

TrueChristian,ffdo6ve,t1_ffdn6bp,1579825059.0,"After he died I dreamed of him in a white jacket. He had beautiful white wings on his back. He was very handsome and in my ""dream"" he was checking himself out smiling and feeling the fabric of his coat (he enjoyed high quality clothes). A few days after this dream, I went into a store just to try to feel normal. It was summer, I had on a sun dress and the air conditioning inside made it very cold. As I went to check out at the register, I let an elderly lady get in line in front of me.She looked at me and said ""honey aren't you cold?"" When I said yes, she took off her WHITE JACKET and put it on me while I waited behind her. The warmth that I felt from that jacket was almost abnormal. I knew it was confirmation from God that my dream was real."
TrueChristian,ffcw6lv,t3_esx4x4,1579808534.0,"YES!! When my 3 children were very small.. when I was newly saved andbefore I knew his voice, he told me that I wasnt going to have one of my children for very long. I pushed that thought deep inside but lived with the fear of losing one of my children. I became so overprotective of them through their lives. I always felt compelled to take many many pictures through the years. Fast forward about 20 years...I lost my beloved 26 year old son to suicide 7 months ago. Because the Lord prepared me years ago, I am able to confidently believe that his passing was written long before I ever knew. Because I heard that voice and that message I am able to heal."
