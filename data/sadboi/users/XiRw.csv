2.) MV-STREET-(pivot route number) military end time. 

3.) MV-OFFICE-ROUTE NUMBER

Nah trust me not everyone has their shit together at 25 or any age. And if they did it doesn't matter, nobody has the same path in life. It's why I try my best to actively not judge people anymore and try to put myself more in their shoes. 

That's great though you have that. There's literally nothing wrong with one or two close friends. I'd take that over people who are shallow and have multiple friends who they don't actually care about or can't handle.

I literally sent a message to someone on tinder yesterday too hoping they didn't reply back. They haven't, but I still feel like shit when they don't. It's like a double edged sword. 

I think that's normal for everyone though with really bad anxiety to have their best facets suppressed. The misleading part was flawless btw. I try to come off cool but also think what am I doing? This person is going to see right through me if we meet and it will hurt a lot worse in person if she leaves right away because she won't like the real me either. 

I don't know how to get over that part other than to tell them I have bad anxiety from the start. But that never goes well for me.

There's gotta be something man.

 I would also post this on /r/suicidewatch too so more people can help and give you more ideas. 

It would be easier for you if you at least had a car and can leave in that where you can find a job, live in that for awhile and eventually buy an apartment. I'd honestly just take your mom's car though. If she wants it back so badly but doesn't want to help you she can get it herself.

The people surrounding you sounds fucked up and it seems like there's no reason to get involved with them. They just sound toxic to begin with. So I wouldn't feel bad or worry about whether they like you or not. 

Also your life is worth more than your economic value. I get that money is your only means of potentially leaving a place like that but don't get so down where you feel like it defines you because it sure as hell doesn't. 

I don't think the people in your town hate you though unless they are really talking shit to you. Rural towns have a small amount of people surrounding you to begin with anyway so if you guys don't vibe and your personalities don't match, I would just think it's a clash of personalities. But again with a place like that I wouldn't feel too bad. You seem nice so if they do hate you it's probably jealousy in some way if I had to guess.
