I think they're both shit, and fuck over certain marginalized groups over others. The problem with electoralism or ""lesser-evilism"" is that these utilitarians force upon people their own version of ""least damage"" without regard to the imposed suffering of what their preferred party does to others.

Etcetera... Etcetera..... Etcetera......

You can do the same thing for Trump if you wanted.

Presenting democrats as some kind of 'marginal improvement' is a disingenuous framing of politics or, really, simply a misunderstanding of how statist politics work, in that no ""benefit"" or ""improvement"" comes without someone else being thrown under the bus. We aren't reducing suffering by electing democrats, we're just restructuring it so different marginalized groups suffer in different ways.

If you think a democrat is your best shot at surviving or for what matters to you, ok. I won't attack you for voting for them. But I have a problem with them being framed as the ""lesser-evil"", because such a figure really doesn't exist historically, and actually serves to perpetuate the cycles of poverty and violence and nationalism, etc.

No you haven't. You haven't? How? How is it anarchist?

IN PRACTICE as you claimed it was anarchistic in Rojava). Which.... by the way, you still have not responded to my criticism when I called out how the PYD is not anarchist when you claimed they were the largest social organization of such style of practices.

\>  and pointed you to a recent critique of Bookchin by a well-credentialed anarchist writer describing Bookchin's model as anarchist

First off, what the fuck is a ""well-credentialed anarchist"".

Furthermore, I did not provide a link that claimed Bookchin to be an anarchist. You did. In fact, the author in that link seemingly contradicts themselves.

|As more localities were transformed into communal assemblies, they would supposedly associate with each other, beginning to form an overall confederation... If the communal confederation won, it would be a revolution! With all due respect for Murray Bookchin’s insights and achievements, I regard this as a crackpot fantasy. The idea of building local assemblies and associations is a version of community organizing, which anarchists are for. But the municipal government is part of the state; trying to get elected to it has the same problems which anarchists have always pointed to in the efforts of Marxists and others to get elected to any level of government. In Kropotkin’s words, “*…The anarchists refuse to be party to the present-State organizations….They do not seek to constitute, and invite the workingmen not to constitute, political parties in the parliaments….They have endeavored to promote their ideas directly amongst the labor organizations and to induce those unions to a direct struggle against capital, without placing their faith in parliamentary legislation*”|
|:-|


Your article (or at least the author) says that Bookchin had anti-state sentiments that "" fits my definition of anarchism."", but then goes on to critique Bookchin's philosophy as anti-anarchist. So even this article helps prove my point further that even if you think Bookchin had good intentions (which I would disagree heavily with you can the author here), the author and I both agree that Communalists are not anarchists. So I don't understand why this is being used here.

>\>  If the thing is anti-capitalist, anti-hierarchical and anti-statist (and the sticking point here is that your definition of what a state is appears to be different than the one I'm used to from anarchist literature), that's all I'm interested in.

You're version of anti-state society must allow for ""justifiable hierarchy"" in order for you to allow Communalism to be anarchist, it's the only conceivable way I can see that you can perform this logical gymnastics.

They are NOT identical and you have neither proven this nor refuted any of my points regarding this. Bookchin criticized anarchism and moved AWAY from anarchist ""foundational tenets and the means of organization"" by literally creating his own ideology.

His literal concept of the ""unbridgeable chasm"" was a false dichtomy of *“two basically contradictory tendencies: a personalistic commitment to individual autonomy and a collectivist commitment to social freedom”.* Basically, between individual ""autonomy"" (which Bookchin labeled as bourgeois) and social ""freedom"", which MUST be upheld through democracy and municipalism. Bookchin literally broke with anarchism because he decided it was easier to impose his own theories on others than to respect the autonomy of individuals who didn't think his theories were the best for them.

In what world is that anarchism or even identical to anarchism? You haven't responded to this besides ""other people say so"", whereas I have (repeatedly) explained Bookchin's theory and motives being antithetical to anarchist thought (which he heavily criticized as being ""decadent"" and ""petit-bourgeois"").

Is anti-hierarchy and anti-statist

Not once have you done this. Whereas I have labored to refute, almost line by line, any point you have addressed (whether it addressed my points vaguely or just auxiliary), how Bookchin and his Communalist theory proposes hierarchy and a state (in a different name) by imposing involuntary minarchist confederacies instead.

At this point, by consequence, going by the logic you raise, I can argue Marxism is anarchism through the same metrics that ""others"" argue that Communalism is anarchist.

Minarchism =/= anarchism.

That is the core of my argumentation. I cannot be any clearer here.

&#x200B;

>\> Especially given that, *in the context of this thread*, this model has been the only successful means of large-scale social organization for anarchist polities thus far

That.

Does not.

Make it Anarchist.

&#x200B;

Rojava is not anarchist at all. It has not implemented ONE anarchist policy. Power is consolidated in the PYD, who has monopolized basic services (as a result, even their own demconfed principles have been severely undermined).

""[The PYD is an effective provider of services, a function it also instrumentalizes as a means of consolidating its power. Service provision varies across Rojava: in areas where the PYD co-exists with regime authorities, a myriad of institutions have developed, sometimes creating parallel structures. Meanwhile, in areas where the PYD enjoys greater control, power remains centralized, despite the PYD’s claims to decentralize power to the local level. In Arab-majority areas such as Manbij, locals report that the PYD ensures that only representatives that are loyal to it are able to govern, undermining the legitimacy of the new structures in the eyes of the local community.](https://www.chathamhouse.org/sites/default/files/publications/research/2016-12-08-governing-rojava-khalaf.pdf)""

Now.... again, whether you want to be sympathetic to their condition or situation is different, and associating with them for whatever purpose you want is your perogative.

However, there is zero justification, ZERO.... to say they are, as you say, ""the only successful means of large-scale social organization for anarchist polities thus far"". I beg you for examples to the contrary where the PYD is engaging free-association-based praxis and to refute my evidence where it has monopolized resource distribution and centralizing power.

You have NO justifiction for communalists to be congruently labeled as anarchists. You have not GIVEN a justification for communalists to be labeled as anarchists that hasn't already been refuted. I have given many points (in great detail and length) regarding the ideology and history of Communalist theory that has gone against various forms of anarchist theory and praxis.

And it does not matter if ""actual anarchists"" think it is anarchistic. An anarchist saying Marxism is anarchist does not make it anarchist. Anarchism may take many forms but there are clear criteria in terms of power relations and the ability for free association that must be generally seen for something to appropriate the term. Communalism does not, and any ""anarchist thinker"" who holds the opposing view would face the same criticism from me and many other anarchists as well.

Your point has no justification. Not even Bookchin would agree with you.

If you wish to continue hold that point **while admitting that you have no justification for this point or against any other points I have raised**, then that is fine (as is your perogative) and this ends the discussion. If not, you are just conversing in bad faith."
Anarchism,fpymcrf,t1_fpxxuqc,1589006250.0,"\> And you're completely free to hold that stance. I don't.

Bookchin. Literally. Rejected. Anarchism. I have literally described how Communalism rejects free association. He literally rejected the view that anarchists can hold non-standardized, non-blanket forms of free association and instead devised a contrived system as a blanket catch-all prescription which necessitates a council-com-esque state approproating woke language and fetishizing democratic control as a justification for his state.

>\> \[H\]e continued to oppose the state (as a bureaucratic-military organization above the rest of society), denying the Marxist idea of a “transitional” or “workers’“ state. He continued to reject capitalism and the market. He continued to oppose all other forms of domination, oppression, and hierarchy (sexism, racism, homophobia, imperialism, and so on), Frankly, rejecting the state, capitalism, and all other aspects of oppression fits my definition of anarchism.

Ok, that SOUNDS all good..... but then you go on to say:

&#x200B;

>\> By “communalism,” he meant a “confederation” (a decentralized federation) of ecologically-balanced neighborhoods and communities. In them both the economy and the polity (“government” **without the state**) would be **managed by directly-democratic citizen assemblies**, the self-organized people. 

You're holding a position Bookchin never formulated in regards to being compatible with anarchism. There's no free association in Communalism. I have no autonomy opposed from these assemblies or outside the scope of these confederations, which I have no choice but to participate in with an imbalance of poltiical, economic, and social power relations. This is antithetical to anarchist thought. And when Bookchin faced criticisms from anarchists on these points, he labeled them ""individualists"" and ""lifestyleists"" and ended up going back to Marxist dialectics.

As much as a dickhead that Bob Black is, [I recommend reading his very detailed criticism on Bookchin](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/bob-black-anarchy-after-leftism#toc3). It goes into much more considerable depth that I could here.

&#x200B;

>\> Personally, I'll work with and ally with any other anarchists/socialist libertarians, including communalists, who hold the same foundational tenets, regardless of what they label themselves as or what labels are applied to them. To do otherwise is counterproductive.

Again, this is fine, I just have a HUGE problem calling them anarchists, when their ideology, as I have described in GREAT detail, goes against anarchism, and this form of association (rather than that of self-interest and autonomy) can cause great harm to anarchists in the long run, as has happened in the past with authcoms (and yes, I don't see authcoms or Commualists much different except for their implemetations)."
Anarchism,fpwsy4p,t1_fpwd1aq,1588969397.0,">\> Again, tendencies towards individualist and social anarchism have been identified since the beginning of our history, and social anarchism has been the dominant tendency. This isn't a dichotomy, false or otherwise; it's simply about what priority one places on the role of anarchism as a **social** ideology.

Every political ideology is a social ideology. This means nothing.

>\> Every anarchist has preferred models. That's kind of one of the defining characteristics of anarchism; that there are as many schools as there are anarchists (even more, actually). Suggesting that those who ascribe to the same foundational tenets of rejecting capitalism, hierarchy and the state aren't anarchist because they prefer certain models of doing so doesn't seem very anarchist, especially if you can't describe how those foundational tenets differ.

Ok but you're forgetting one thing here.

**Communalists 👏 are 👏 not 👏 anarchists 👏**

Communalism is an EXPLICIT REJECTION of anarchism in favor of both hierarchy and a state (anti-capitalist praxis is the only thing shared), and uses ""woke language"" and buzzwords (like direct democracy and 'horizontalism') for self-apologia and to belittle anarchists. That's a pretty compelling reason why I as an anarchist would be very skeptical with associating with them. They are highly incompatible. There's a reason bookchin broke with anarchism (as well as calling all the individualist anarchists fascists and/or liberals) and that should be enough for them not to be here spouting how their shit is compatible like some magic jigsaw puzzle. I see basically no reason to defend him anymore than I would defend Marx.

I will never understand why people will defend tooth and nail for them on a sub for anarchism. Cue the Apu simpsons bullet meme.

&#x200B;

>\> For one, you still haven't defined the state or how the means of social organization shared by every major school of anarchist/libertarian socialist thought makes confederalism or municipalism ""statist"" in itself. Structure (or the lack of it) isn't the defining feature of anarchism and has never been.

A monopoly over the legitimate use of violence is a pretty clear definition for this purpose. I don't think minarchism is ""closer"" to anarchism really (and that's what Communalism is.... it's just minarchism). It's an overarching participatory democracy, albeit just one with more ""local"" participation.

Structure isn't itself statist, sure, so I will make myself more clear on this point. Bookchin wanted a clear structure to be universally applicable and imposed on people regardless of their wishes to associate with his ideology. There is no free association in Communalism. There can't be. His suggestion was that direct democratic assemblies would ""replace"" the state, but they retain the same character as an overarching democracy with ultimate decision making power over its citizens. That's a statist blueprinted structure, and a structure incompatible with anarchism.

&#x200B;

>\> PS - Confederations, communes and recallable delegates have been called for by anarchists since before the First International, including by Bakunin and the aforementioned Kropotkin.

Cool they're not the gatekeepers of what is anarchism could be. Like I said, I don't stan Kropotkin for many reasons (and surely not Bakunin).

Also you're conflating two highly different points. When Kropotkin advocated for a certain structure, he by no means assumed this to be an imposition (although he had some pretty shit takes imposing other things regarding labor, but that's for another discussion). Municipalities do. They are overarching democratic structures with ultimate decision making power over their members, territorial authorities (i.e states). Libertarian municipalism is just a more participatory & directly democratic state, which isn't any better in my view, and highly contrasts in contexts to the ways other forms of structures were proposed.

&#x200B;

>\> It's how the CNT organized in Catalonia. You'll need to more clearly define what you personally mean by statism or the state for us to continue this discussion to any meaningful outcome.

Again, a monopoly over the legitimate use of violence is a pretty clear definition for this purpose. I don't consider the CNT to be anarchist. Perhaps anarchist ideals one could say (and given the context of their situation, there's a lot that was not able to be achieved). Although the CNT is not really to be stanned either (cue in labor camps), the CNT-FAI had a state, though I probably would have preferred it to most states. And as I've stated since the beginning, associating with people whom you wish is fine. It's when the association is not free (which is what Communalism want as the end goal) which makes the relationship not to be sustainably anarchistic.

&#x200B;

>\> Which is somewhat moot at this point if even Kropotkin and Bakunin are rejected for espousing the same means of social organization as Bookchin does. But more relevant in the original context of this thread, if we're now rejecting confederations, communes, recallable delegates, etc. as ""atomized statism"", I'm afraid we'd be left with no historical (or existing) examples of large-scale anarchism which we can point to.

And?

&#x200B;

>\>  Given that this was the model also used in *The Dispossessed*, we may not even be left with many fictional examples. This is counterproductive, especially in a thread about a teacher rejecting a young student's essay about anarchism as ""unworkable"".

You're assuming that these are the only forms of ""anarchism"" when not only has anarchism as been practiced in various indigenous and historical settings, but elsewhere that aren't political programs that can be frameworked in everyday activities. Any p2p software has a very decentralized framework that one can model and extrapolate more abstractly as a form of mutual aid.  There's lots of anarchist stuff you can do even in remote/rural areas (which is missed by a city-centric nature of Communalism), like conservation efforts for example (such as guerrilla gardening). Counter-economics, red and black markets, DIY projects to subvert corporate industry. Cooperatives (depending on the economic structure), squatting, many other tools can be used to subvert existing structures to engage in **prefigurative politics**, one of praxis to promote better associations rather than theorists just guessing.

My family, my friends, my relationships, my co-workers, my organizations, Discord fam, etc, you and I are in many different associations. Some are polluted with economic and social authority (for reasons of living in a state), but for the most part we're all subject to our own associations and can freely associate with whomever we wish. We relate to each other better as individuals with the ability to freely associate rather than blueprinted structures.

We don't need to create a foolproof blueprinted system to solve every problem ever. It's inefficient and only justified with some force to back up that monopolized system.

Henceforth, fuck Bookchin

I would certainly hope not! Bookchin's formulation went again many anarchist thinkers and strategies, specifically because was a grumpy man who wasn't happy with anarchists rejecting his blueprint blanket solutions, and had to run back to Marxism to create his Communalist theories. People calling for ""confederations"", ""communes"", ""recallable delegates"" aren't exposing anarchism, they're exposing a weird Bookchinite atomized statism.

Bookchin wanted a clear structure. Anarchists have historically strived for a freely arranged interconnected network of autonomous networks that disincentivizes power imbalances. Bookchin went against this mode especially in his later career.

&#x200B;

>\> If one defines the state as being an entity that enforces the ""right"" to private property (as in private ownership of the means of production), communalism and most other forms of anarchism/libertarian socialism are all anti-statist

My interpretation of a 'commune' so far has been an intentional community that people join which assumes control over the products of their labor, presumably which makes decisions over what to do with these products through some sort of imposed democracy, which is historically what people like Bookchin (and other certain libsocs i.e councilcoms) have professed. This would not, by default, mean anti-statism.

Bookchin may have had sympathies for anarchism in his early years because he had no other terminology and framework to work under, but even the quote you listed still argues in favor of my point. His distinction between ""individual"" and ""social"" anarchists is meaningless and is just a false dichotomy to argue in favor of a third form: left-minarchism, which is what he founded Communalism as.

&#x200B;

> Large scale social organization is going to be required in one form or another for any working society. For me freedom that is so central to anarchism, means responsibility not only to myself, but others too. But we don't have to choose either individualistic anarchism or social anarchism. 

Yes because there's literally no distinction between ""individual"" or ""social"" anarchism. It is a false dichotomy. One that just obfuscates praxis further.  Also, there's no rationale why ""anarchism"", the absence of states, will contribute to less validity of ""large scale social organization"" being possible. States (even the atomized ones Bookchin proposes) become very unstable and only exist through their monopoly of violence.

&#x200B;

>\>   As I see it, there has to be a balance between individual autonomy and collective responsibility or we quickly devolve into some ancap nightmare where selfish desires rules over mutual aid, or an authoritarian socialist state that rules over the individual.  

What? This is an anarchist sub, right?

We don't need some sort of Bookchinite citycentric statist blueprint or ""direct democracy communes"" to prevent some hypothetical ""ancap nightmare"". This goes against the praxis of building interlapping, balanced associations and  resilient networks of free association that disincentivize attempts to recreate monopolies of power. Communalism goes literally against this, despite whatever woke vocabulary the decomfeds wish to appropriate. 

Ancaps or authcoms can't just ""take over"" when you have various interconnected, redundant, and self-organizing structures with free associations among them to disincentivize power monopolies. If they could then we never achieved anarchism in the first place (or a HUGE external shock came forth)

No, Bookchin clearly hated anarchism's focus on autonomy, hence why he needed to devise a minarchist ideology. ([To quote Bookchin himself](https://radicalarchives.org/2011/12/13/bookchin-anarchism-not-a-social-theory/))

The history of his ideology is peppered with idiosyncratic acts of defiance that verge on the eccentric, which not surprisingly have attracted many young people and aesthetes. In fact, anarchism represents the most extreme formulation of liberalism’s ideology of unfettered autonomy, culminating in a celebration of heroic acts of defiance of the state.""*|

Bookchin was grumpy because individualists didn't like his praxis or his proposals for political programmes, his adherence to marxist dialectics, or his emphasis on municipalities & other forms of localized statism, so he lumped his enemies into ""lifestyle anarchism"" and his friends into ""social anarchism"" until breaking from anarchism entirely a few years later.

Ok.... obviously you know you have imposteur system, but let me tell you why.

We as developers don't see the impact of our contributions. Almost never.

We're pigeonholed to work on very esoteric solutions in a pond of a very complex codebase. We keep working on these solutions and modules and all we do is type `git commit`. We then battle with QA for a long time and code review and project managers that criticize our labor and our effort, which can even lead to late nights depending on the context, which can lead to the development process lasting longer. Then after all that, we just get bug reports. All while having to build the next thing. And the next thing. And the next thing. Over and over and over and over.

It starts to weigh on you. You don't see any of the benefit you may be giving. If at all (or the impact that you wanted to give to the world, hell it could just be glorified safeguarding corporate investors from risk, as is common in the field)

Because devs are just cogs in a machine. We're a piece to the puzzle, in a mentally demanding white-collar trade. But the whole culture act like devs have to be these weird super-human employees that should just be able to look at all technology and all problem scopes and be able to just ""knock it out"".

But it doesn't work like that. Especially not in a field that is 1) diverse and broad, and 2) unlicensed.

This is a very, very, VERY corporate career path. It's designed to put the pressure on devs. It takes a psychological toll. Why unionize when devs just feel like shit and think that things are their fault? Why criticize corporate capitalism helping to create such a toxic culture when surely I must just ""improve"" myself relentlessly to prove my worth?

Managers love it.

To quote George Carlin, ""You know what they want? They want obedient workers. Obedient workers, people who are just smart enough to run the machines and do the paperwork. And just dumb enough to passively accept all these increasingly shitty jobs""

</rant>      


In other words.... I think you're doing just fine. Just don't let the world tell you you're shit when clearly you're worth more than the code you write for a CEO.

Any solution will not be found ""writing code on the weekends"" or ""grinding leetcode"" or ""doing outside projects"". This may improve you in some way but more dangerously this will just feed into your Imposter Syndrome. Nothing will ever be enough. This will just cause more stress on you.

This is a mental health issue. We may not be able to control the source (our job, our culture, our capitalist corporate economy), but until we all unionize, we need to treat this as what this is.... a mental health issue. And ""pushing"" yourself is not a mental health solution in this regard

Which is why this ad hominem is ridiculous, you're attacking my past rather than my points.

Also some fraternities do have some hierarchies (mostly with pledges vs actives) but this has been challenged in the past few years, especially the fraternity I was in (as well as abolishing all forms of hazing). In any case, only brothers were allowed to live in the house  and there wasn't really an imposed hierarchy between us in terms of living conditions (certain people had certain roles, but many fraternities by their nature are a participatory and collaborative by nature in terms of decision making). I probably wouldn't do it again (for other reasons, personally) given a chance nor am I glorifying fraternities nor do I really care to defend them beyond this point, because this is all an ad hominem tangent.

&#x200B;

>And I agree with you, all of this SHOULD be irrelevant if we were all raised with good emotional intelligence and communication skills. But we're purposefully not.

Oooooook..... Here are my thoughts......

You're providing a standard right-wing Malthusian overpopulation myth at me and imposing that more people = more conflict, and using that to justify some sort of hierarchy. You then go to say that ""certain people"" lack emotional intelligence and this snowballs into conflict, and therefore, ANECDOTALLY (which who the fuck knows if I can even verify), you proceed to say that hierarchical solutions were the best and only solutions. Which you sneakily asked me for my personal backstory so that you can use this now (and in the future) as further ad hominem attacks to justify your argument over mine with not much need to further logically prove your points on your end. Right?

Here's my fuckin problem here. **YOU ARE NOT ATTACKING ANARCHISM**. Not once did I see an attack on anarchism or really a case for governance. Not once did you explain a power relation between these roommates where one person has a perpetually imbalanced power relation against all others in order to reduce everyone's agency. You don't see someone with say, a gun and tell people to pick up the trash ""or else!"". You didn't say there was domestic or emotional abuse where one person imposed unchallenged violence to impose their will over others? Or financial abuse? (well maybe the landlord).

All you did was just share stories of bad roommates.

Which.... by the way, what you did... from the paragraphs I read, isn't really a solution I would have disagreed with. I don't reject the concept of division of labor (I also think anarchism in general will feature a less strict division of labor than we see in capitalism, for obvious reasons). Roommates are free to come to agreements about who does what, when they do it, if they rotate, whether they choose to disassociate, whatever. It's up to them. If they voluntarily say ""hey Susie"" (big polar female who's a task master) ""you're good with scheduling stuff can you whip up some stuff up?"", ok.... cool. If Susie acts as a mediator this is fine to the consent of everyone participating. I don't know the full context of what you did, nor may I ever know. In fact, neither of us can prove we're not lying about our past. But it doesn't matter. 

**Anarchism isn't an abolition of conflict, it's making sure that one person's agency doesn't unilaterally impose itself over others based on the context of imbalanced power relations.**

Statist arrangements face the same conflict and choose to solve it with a ""or else"" form. This is government, because to be GOVERNED is to conduct the policy and actions of those beneath you, without consent.

The value of anarchic conditions is that we countervail the threat of power imbalances occurring through various means, like free association, meaningful exit, and the lack of structurally imposed abject poverty making reconfiguring these social institutions much easier with much lower costs overall (be it economic, social, emotional, etc).  All of these features of anarchic conditions are compounding and make our relationships and networks much more resilient from the formation of hierarchy. You could even say that's the point in the first place.

It's an interconnected network of people doing what they want, when they want (sometimes that's through ""communism"", sometimes it's through more explicit exchange)

It's not a question of emotional intelligence, as you state. It's a question on the context of power relations."

Etc. Etc. Etc.  


Presenting social democrats (or in the U.S..... moderates) as some kind of 'marginal improvement' is a disingenuous framing of their politics or, charitably, simply a misunderstanding of how statist politics work, in that no 'benefit' or 'improvement' comes without someone else being thrown under the bus. We aren't marginally reducing exploitation or suffering by electing socdems, we're just restructuring it so different marginalized groups suffer in different ways. I'm not willing to tell the people thrown under the bus that these politicians represents a 'marginal improvement', because that's spitting in their face.

Government exists to make us cede control over our future. I'm not one to say participating is ""legitimizing"" government, but government exists to exert it's own power over people. Government is the enemy, because hierarchical relations are the enemy that relies on an imbalance of power structures that allow some people to exploit others without consequence.

No because I don't want an authoritarian takeover. It's not even necessary, it's actually harmful. Revolutions replace power structures without abolishing them. Insurrection is for those who wish to remove themselves from the current power dynamic and to create alternative networks and actions to subvert the governmental power dynamic imposed on us. People who promote revolution (whether 'social' or 'political') have this weird ""urgency"" argument that allows them to justify their upcoming authoritarianism which helps promote the same problems in the first place. This is why we reject both Marxist-Leninist theory as well as milquetoast socdems.

I'm sure they don't have some monopoly of violence over you to tell you what to do with them or for them.  


> Getting rid of a violence monopoly requires violence to get rid of it..

Oh good we're at Leninism now. 

The bottom line about anarchy from a perspective of violence is that it represents a balance of power between various freely associated entities. As such, there are many entities capable of doing violence, they're just countervailed by all the other ones. Anarchists want incentives based on power relations for us to cooperate to defend each other or commit to mutual aid with each other, considering all of the nodes in this network have some degree of interdependence economically, socially, etc.

Well I wouldn't have minded the ""bluntness"" here if I didn't feel this misses what I was conveying in my post.

What I'm saying is that I feel that software engineering, as an industry or career or however you want to frame it, has become so corporatized that the output isn't generated really for direct impact or good for people, but for the maximization of profits for firms, regardless of the product. I've literally have done this many-a-time in my years as a software developer, and even with talking with developers much, much, MUCH older than I (for just one example, a 50+ year old dev I work with has confided to me that most of the software he's written is 'code that no one even uses', in several jobs over his career, and a lot of layoffs from corporate downsizing and the last two recessions).

I am NOT saying that software engineering is pointless. I am NOT ""blaming everyone but myself"" (I'm not even sure where you even concluded this). My criticism lies more in corporate America, and therefore leads me to the question: are there opportunities where this career and the corporate world are decoupled.

Yes, I think this is fair. When I work on personal projects, sometimes it's just for me (which is fine), but mostly it's for other people and communities that I'm interacting with. From either Discord bots to Chrome Extensions to help people and communities I'm in (or even just silly shit), like that sort of stuff makes me happy as well as others and keeps me direct with feedback from others to make my stuff better. And it's helped me to learn better practices in SE and other technologies I wouldn't have the opportunity in my job(s). Like I know those things makes impact there.

So obviously there's no real reason to leave this field since I have experience with making people smile and have a direct impact with my skillset, it doesn't make any sense.

ExperiencedDevs,fo8gxlr,t1_fo8fa68,1587596339.0,">Why do you believe that profit making software and people helping software are different things?

Not by necessity, but as the corporitization of software increases, profit becomes optimized into the #1 priority, and all other factors become secondary or irrelevant. There may in fact be positive utility and these Venn Diagrams may overlap and that's fine, the point I've come to the conclusion is that when the industry focuses jobs into firms that wish to maximize profit, then you see erosion of meaning and utility and meaningful factors. That's kinda how I view the industry at this point.

mmhmm, great thought experiment. And this is based on? Nothing? Wonderful.

I love when capitalist apologists somehow think that a lack of exploitative property norms, which actually creates artificial scarcity which we see in society today, especially in terms of housing, somehow thing we'll end up with LESS stuff when we don't have leaches. But you do you!

&#x200B;

>The human population is growing and eventually, the houses we currently have are going to ""run out"". Who is going to build more houses?

Uh, people who know how to make houses? Labor is labor and doesn't change, the only thing that is changing is the directive of the usage of the labor from building as a way to increase speculative profits to building as a necessity based on reciprocity, in ways they see fit based on the product of their own labor.

&#x200B;

>People who already live in houses have no incentive to do so. Even the good samaritans will run into the ""opportunity cost"" of devoting their time and efforts towards something they won't get anything back from.

What is the incentive to do so NOW? Houses are being built with NO ONE living in them, or being built in places that are inaccessible do to geographic or socioeconomic barriers on entry to these markets. There's even LESS incentive to do so in a capitalist economy than in a post-capitalist one where mutual aid or non-statist market economies would endure. The only incentive these days is a negative one where labor is precarious and faces the threat of starvation or, ironically, homelessness, to achieve building these projects for the benefit of property speculators. It implies, therefore, that this economy is based on the exploitation due to the coercion of labor. That's YOUR economy's incentive.

**Rent (and interest) are the result of forcible enclosure of the commons, and the imposition of accumulatory, dispossessive property norms. People have no incentive to set these kinds of norms up in the absence of some violent force imposing them... because they mean more work for almost all of us for the benefit of a select few.**

Wouldn't it be better if people were too..... idk, actually create meaningful, fair, and reciprocal engagements with the people around them to actually contribute to each other in however they see fit, without quasi-planned economic relations to do so (planned but not just by a state, but by speculation)

&#x200B;

>People might be able to build their own houses, but most would be of crappy quality and quite unsafe.

Jesus shit no one has to build their ""own"" houses, this is a strawman. Get rid of the fucking middlemen of leaches and speculators. You can even do this through market exchanges if you wanna go through a mutualist route (if a communist set of relations doesn't seem scalable, which I might actually agree on context). But if you're conflating anarchism with ""everything is DIY"" then you need to educate yourself on anarchist theory before we continue.

&#x200B;

>And those construction companies aren't going to come over and build houses for you for free, either!

No, it doesn't have to be ""free"", in fact we shouldn't even prescribe how such organizations or relations should enact. The fact is that we don't need to COERCE people to a set of normalized relations, because this implies that someone (or institution) controls these relations and has the power to exploit from it. This is the capitalist market mode of relations, this is the speculative mode of relations, this is the statist mode of relations, as monopolization on things such as access credit and private property norms create things like artificial scarcity in the first place . Do you really think people are dumb that they can't agree to a set of relations between themselves and others and other communities to come to reasonable demands

I ask you whether you would prefer to receive the full product of your labor or a fraction of it with an unnecessary parasite (the capitalist, the speculator, the state, whatever it may be) taking the lion's share? If not, you are on your way to accepting anarchist theory.

We're not losing labor, in fact the labor force of people creating and building housing isn't changing.

The same incentive there is now? People built houses and communities before the modern conception of rent, because we need shelter.

COMPLETEANARCHY,fkrjrie,t1_fkrdmpo,1584470234.0,">Bernie Sanders has a better track record on imperialism than the other candidates , under his presidency it’s likely that the third world will at the very least not have increased suffering  

By what metrics? Bernie has consistently voted for American imperialist policies and bills from sanctions to bombings which have harmed many people, from the former Yugoslavia to Iraq and elsewhere, as well as his favor of continuing drone strikes. Some policies will help some outside the U.S, some will maintain suffering, some will make it much worse.

Again, you cannot make that judgement unless you're willing to disregard certain people's suffering over others.

> Back in the US, Bernie Sanders will drastically reduce suffering. 

Again for who? Some yes, but many other will not. Bernie has had a record which harms sex workers, immigrants, part time/gig workers (who need supplemental income to survive), etc. Again, you're just applying YOUR subjective criteria, and instead of using it to vote for yourself, you're claiming that your subjective criteria is now an OBJECTIVE calculus by which to apply universally, which is demonstrably false, for any candidate."
