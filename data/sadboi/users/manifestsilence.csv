Well I always thought that a bit silly, but yesterday I learned otherwise. I didn't actually shoot myself, but I went to pull an arrow out of the horse mat backstop and didn't look behind the arrow at where the nock was pointed. It went through my pants and gave a pretty intense gash in my leg.

It's especially hard for me to not fugue off into tons of mental tangents while listening to others. I think it helps to remember that your thoughts aren't usually as important as you think they are, and if you forget to say them it's not a big deal compared to the cost of hanging on to them instead of listening. It takes a lot of courage to respond authentically to conversation, too. I mean, there's a balance where you don't want to be rude if you're totally bored by a conversation or whatever, but for the most part what's the point of having a fake conversation where you're just giving out right answers? A huge part of it is just letting go of the need to please or placate others and instead feeling the confidence to be able to be your true self, to not feel like there's an obligatory emotional response to what you hear. Sometimes I just give myself a second to not feel the need to show my automatic response and instead listen to myself for a second in response to what someone has said, so I can respond more authentically."

The other thing I think helps for a similar reason is reading old English classics, like Dickens, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, H.G. Wells, Jules Verne, any from the time when authors used long, well-structured sentences. The act of reading sentences that take actual effort to parse and keep your place in is hugely valuable for ones ability to manipulate language when writing.

Anxiety,fq8vbg4,t3_ghekk1,1589176568.0,"As someone who grew up learning Transcendental Meditation at age 10, I mostly agree. I think excessive practice of meditation is counterproductive unless you're already leading a healthy lifestyle in bigger ways and still have time to blow on that. Otherwise it's just going to be taking the place of sleep, and no, it's not better than sleep.

But I've found that for me, shorter more to-the-point exercises have helped a lot. Like, instead of focusing on a tree for ages on end, unless you're feeling so chill that you actually naturally want to do that and you're just giving yourself permission by calling it meditation, I just do the five senses exercise. One or two cycles of, name five things you can see, five things you can hear, five you can smell (I never smell five things with allergies), five you can feel outside your body, and five you can feel inside your body. No love for taste I guess, but it works for me. I find that it pays on the second pass to really focus on seeing, hearing, etc. the things in detail, where the first pass might have been a casual noticing.

With breathing, I find the only ones that are actually effective are ones that slow the breath down enough that you get more CO2 buildup. Like 4-7-8, which is breathe in 4 seconds, hold 7, breathe out 8.

A lot of the more ""subtle"" arts I think are kind of just diluting the time spent vs. gains ratio. Like, I'd rather do focused stretching based on my needs than memorize a long yoga series. The basic sun salutes are nice. Anything longer is only worth it to me if it's part of a guided class once in a while. I just don't have the attention span for more focusing on anxiety instead of on life.

I also do find body scanning and free dance to be hugely helpful for the physical effects of anxiety. For body scanning I lie still and just wander my mind over my body, looking for bad spots. If I find one, I kind of just lean attention into it mentally, giving attention or imagining more heat or blood flow to the area. The attention seems to help things unclench.

Free dance is just any dance that feels good and doesn't have predefined structure. Usually it works well with new age stuff. You just dance with no thought of it as a performance for others, or even yourself. Just letting your body enjoy moving with the music or however it is inspired to move. Sometimes I move a certain way because it exercises a sore spot, as therapy. Sometimes it's more of an emotional thing, wanting to move a certain way because of how you feel. Sometimes it's to express a movement just to enjoy moving, which makes it actually be an art, but the point is the art comes second to self care. You move how you want, not how you think you should.

Anyway, This might be more than you care to hear about, but it's what has helped me thus far. I've stopped mangling my beard when I get anxious, which is a pretty objective measure of improvement for me."
WhatMusicalinstrument,fq69ig1,t3_gh3zy5,1589127206.0,"The Maui Xaphoon is a cheap, simple way to get into reed instruments and see if you like them. It's super portable and sounds like a mellow saxophone or clarinet. It looks like a traditional instrument but was invented by a sax player in 1972.

It has a 2 octave range, similar to traditional flutes. By contrast a sax has nearly three octaves and a clarinet nearly four. It can play fully chromatically but not easily, so is best for playing songs in keys with a similar number of sharps and flats to its labeled key. Since they're inexpensive, people often collect them in several keys and switch for different songs. For folk music, this instrument may be the only thing you ever need.

There are other similar instruments such as the pocket clarinet, and things like this are relatively easy to make. One technique is to take an existing clarinet mouthpiece (from a broken clarinet or a player who upgraded), heat a piece of 1/2 inch PVC at one end, and jam it in while the PVC is soft. This makes a mouthpiece socket but will somewhat compress the cork so it may no longer fit in clarinets any more without repair. Then you just need to decide what length (there's a sweet spot for any given diameter, and a limitation of what your fingers will reach). It's best to model the hole positions off of an existing instrument. What matters is the proportional placement relative to the length, so you can even model off a photo. Use a fairly small drill bit at first, and you can increase the hole size to make a note higher. Bigger holes make a clearer tone, too, but are harder to cover when playing.

Tips for playing any single reed instrument:

Be very careful with the thin end of the reed! One little chip in the end, not even visible unless you gently flex it along the edge, will totally ruin it usually.

Don't bite! Use your lower lip as a cushion over your lower teeth, and your upper teeth should be directly on the instrument. If your lower lip gets a groove in it, you're pressing too hard. This makes the high notes come out but is a bad habit. To correct, temporarily try playing with both lips cushioning your teeth. This makes it impossible to bite very hard but lowers your overall control. Some players always play this way but I don't recommend it as a default habit.

Learn to sand reeds flat. 600 automotive wet or dry sandpaper on a hard flat surface. Sand in a circle or figure eight, with the thin end of the reed sticking off a half inch. Sanding the thinnest part will destroy the reed. Sand whenever the reed is acting squeaky and it will gradually tame it and make it last much longer.

Rotate at least four reeds. They will last longer, you'll have a backup reed, and you'll remember to take them off the instrument so gunk doesn't build up!

Play a siren. To begin, try whispering an ee vowel vs an ah vowel. When playing, the ee should give a higher pitched, brighter, more intense sound. Try this on the note with all the finger holes open. Go as high as you can go, and as low as you can go. For some instruments, this will be the same note, just tuned a bit differently. For others, you can get an actual police siren sound. When playing normally, you will want to play near the upper middle of this range for best tone and tuning. But now you have flexibility to tune yourself as you play. It will also help you hit high and low notes and have the best tone.

Use steady air. When tonguing notes, your tongue should actually gently touch the tip of the reed. Your air shouldn't stop. If you hit exactly the center of the reed tip, you can keep blowing and the lightest touch will stop the sound. This opens up the ability to tongue very fast notes and very short ones. 

Slur. You don't have to tongue every note. In classical music, it will be written when to tongue or not, but in other music use your judgement. Slurred notes are more lyrical, tongued are more rhythmic. In folk music I nearly always slur and use grace notes instead for emphasis like Irish players do on flute and bagpipes."
WhatMusicalinstrument,fq66hkr,t1_fq5wpfu,1589125479.0,"Cool! The first rule of reeds is don't bite! Other than minimal pressure from your lower lip, tucked over your lower teeth, it's all in your tongue position. Try whispering an ee vs an ah sound. Directing the air with tongue shape changes the tuning and tone, so you have a lot more control over the sound than with recorder."

WhatMusicalinstrument,fq4zl2t,t3_ggv112,1589088132.0,"So I love all the clarinet family, but wanted to tell you about my favorite one, which is also one of the rarest.

The basset horn is a low clarinet, half way between a regular Bb and a bass clarinet. It's pitched in F, so the transposition is all different and the parts have to be written specially for it (or the French horn which is one of the only other common F instruments). 

First, why so many weird sizes of clarinet? It's to do with how and when the instrument evolved. 

The clarinet evolved from a folk instrument called the chalemeau, that only played in the lowest register, and gave that register of the clarinet its name. They had a very mellow, quiet sound compared to the modern clarinet. The clarinet gradually added keys to this, allowing it to play in the upper register and to play more accidentals.

Clarinet was a late addition to the orchestra. Mozart was near the end of his short life by the time his orchestra got clarinets, so much of his music lacks clarinet parts. 

The clarinets of the time still had few keys, so they took some work to play in unusual key signs. There was more use of half-covered holes and awkward cross fingering (like lifting only your middle finger) to get certain notes. They also had somewhat more limited range, due to the limitations of mouthpiece and reed quality at the time, and were still much quieter than today.

But clarinets are relatively cheap to build, being one of the least expensive things in an orchestra. So the solution was to just make clarinets of several sizes, to make them able to each play well in a different set of key signs and range. As clarinet became more versatile, this became less necessary, but to this day orchestral players own both an A and Bb clarinet because the two of them combined make all keys easy to play in. 

The other aspect of the clarinet that wasn't nailed down until later was how low it should go. So there were virtuosos of the time who had clarinets with extra keys on them that let them play super low. The Mozart clarinet concerto was written for this, an A clarinet with extra notes down to a low C. Sabine Meyer recorded it as originally intended, and the low notes are glorious:

https://youtu.be/LVgdHjL4a-4

This is the basset clarinet, not to be confused with the basset horn.

Mozart wrote his famous requiem mass, and a chamber work or two, for a lower version of the clarinet with the added keys to low C, but pitched in F - the basset horn. At the time they looked like the insane contraption in the thread picture. Modern ones look like a mini bass clarinet with a less bendy neck, but still a peg to rest it on the floor and a curved metal bell.

Based on some things in his letters about how excited he was about clarinets in general, and that he chose to use this version of it in possibly his greatest work, which some have said he feared was for his own funeral, and which he died before finishing, one could argue that this may have been Mozart's favorite instrument. 

I agree with his taste. Here's a trio played on Mozart-era style basset horns:
https://youtu.be/DiB7eOOOhm0

Why should you play one? Unless you have a very large hobby budget, the way to get to play these is through a school program at a college with a good orchestra. They're about $8k and are only used for a handful of classical pieces. But the experience is glorious. I've played everything from contrabass to Eb piccolo clarinets, and the basset horn absolutely takes the cake for me.

The Mozart requiem played on these is not to be missed, as a player or an audience member. But I think there's a huge untapped potential for this instrument as a solo instrument or in popular music. It's the attack helicopter of the clarinet world, able to play nearly as low as a cello to lay down a bass line, but high and expressive enough to be a great melody instrument. Amazing things could be done with one of these and a loop pedal...

Cheers!

P.S. what's the difference between a basset horn and a basset hound? The basset hound only steps on its own ears!"

IWantToLearn,fpgrhus,t3_gd6rcd,1588608179.0,"You asked about low level stuff, but from the rest of your question I'd like to point out an additional direction that's useful: the abstract theoretical stuff.

Some of it has immediate practical value, like big O theory. Knowing the computational complexity of an algorithm is important to know if it will grind to a halt when given the production size data set.

Then there's the more theoretical stuff that rarely gets used in practice but that I find to be enriching. It helps me keep a sense of wonder when most jobs are CRUD web stuff. The book Godel, Escher, Bach, by Douglas Hofstadter is long, rambling, and beautiful. It's the book that made me decide to try a career in programming. It's a decent way to become acquainted with the fundamental limitations of computability and knowability. There are shorter introductions to things like the Halting Problem, but it ties it to the notion of consciousness and whether our brains are fundamentally any better than a computer.

Or, there are probably some good general books on computer science that give a more straightforward but less charming intro to that stuff. I mostly got that kind of information from reading articles on /r/programming /r/learnprogramming and /r/computerscience and from reading all the XKCD comics and googling things I didn't understand."
Anxiety,fpfd3w7,t3_gcs8l3,1588567778.0,"Yeah I've had exactly this since I was like ten. For me it went so far as to believe that the worry was not just preparation but might actually prevent a bad event just by being there in my head. 

I've been learning to tell myself that the belief that what's in your mind directly changes the outcome of events is false. It's comforting to believe you can think a problem away or ward it off with positive thoughts, but it's not true and the flip side of it is it makes you responsible for all the random bad things that happen. Like if you'd been more vigilant, things would be ok. 

Even without believing that thoughts directly affect stuff, believing that vigilance would keep bad stuff from happening gets crazy fast. Instead, I tell myself that if I'm vigilant now it's just going to tire me out and could actually make it worse when it's needed later. 

So basically thanking the vigilance but telling it it's not needed right now seems to help, and reminding myself that fight or flight is only useful for a very small handful of scenarios. 

Sometimes I imagine some confrontation that would get my heart rate up, and remind myself that that person would never literally be fighting me physically, so the adrenaline isn't going to be needed and just impairs judgement. Sorry this is really rambling, but some of my experience with it.

Also there's an app called Youper that I've found fairly helpful, though less so than actual therapy. It's journaling, plus some questionnaires to track anxiety and other issues. It guides you to recognize cognitive biases in your thinking that promote negative mindsets about events, like catastrophizing.

But if certain notes are out of tune it just makes certain parts of a song sound off. Only thing is the very low notes on piano have single strings, so that would only work for the upper two thirds of the instrument."

Clarinet,fp2d4j6,t1_fp28lvu,1588259673.0,"Towards the upper end of that range you could get a pro or semi pro used one. Stick with the big four: Buffet, Leblanc, Selmer, Yamaha, and realize that the semi pro of all of those are considerably more variable in quality than the pro ones. Hard to go wrong with a used buffet R13 if you find one that's affordable. I highly recommend getting one in a situation where someone experienced can play a scale on it to make sure it's all in good shape if possible, especially if you go with a cheaper model. The other huge frustration source is reed quality. I recommend vandoren V12s, and learning to sand the back flat (all but the thinnest 1/2"") with 600 wet or dry auto sand paper. That's another topic though, which I can say more about, but makes a huge difference for very little work.

Edit: the big thing with used ones is it's hard to know how good a shape the pads are in without someone experienced playing it over. Worst case it's another hundred or two to have a clarinet overhauled to play well. I have a metal Noblet that cost like $20 but took over $100 in repairs and is now super fun for jazz and klezmer.

Steel  guitar means the  style of playing guitar flat horizontally, with both  hands above it like  it's a table. Instead of pushing strings to the  frets, you hold a heavy  piece of steel or other hard material in the  left hand and move it  around on the strings. It makes complex chords  more difficult (except  with pedal steel), but allows for huge  expressivity, such as sliding  between notes across almost any range and  doing many types of vibrato by  shaking or rocking your left hand.

To  initially try out this kind of playing, you can also use a regular  electric or acoustic guitar played on your lap with a guitar slide or   other smooth metal bar held in the left hand, but the string spacing   won't be ideal and you can't do many of the preferred tunings without   risking damage to the neck. One good tuning that won't hurt the guitar  is (low to high) D A D F# A D, which is a good blues tuning. The high A   can also be a B, which gives a minor chord on the higher strings and   major on the lower.

This style of  guitar playing is very different from regular guitar,  and so the  difficulties are different as well. It is easier on the hands  and  requires less strength and left hand finger coordination, but  requires a  good ear and lots of muscle memory since there are no frets  to  automatically get the note in tune. It is more of a melody instrument   than a chord one.

Steel guitar is  what gives a lot of folk, Hawaiian, and country music  its unique  character. All the really bendy, swoopy guitar solo stuff in that kind  of music is one of three different sorts of steel guitar:

Folk  music uses Dobro for the most part. It's acoustic six, seven or  eight  string guitar with an aluminum resonator plate that gives it a  unique,  slightly nasal, throaty tone. Jerry Douglas, Rob Ickes, Mike  Auldridge,  Stacy Phillips, and Billy Cardine are some well-known Dobro  players to  check out.

Dobros are fairly  inexpensive, but the cheapest ones are best  avoided. Gretsch and Regal  are the cheapest somewhat reputable makes,  and Gold Tones are something  that would last into serious playing  without an upgrade.

Hawaiian,  Western Swing, and early country often use lap steel  guitar, which is  the electric guitar equivalent of the Dobro. It has six  or eight  strings typically and is played the same way but often uses a  volume  pedal or some players use a pinky to adjust the volume knob   expressively while playing.

Some  interesting players in this space are Sol Hoopie, Jerry Byrd,  and the  band Double Naught Spy Car. Lap steel guitars are very  inexpensive and  quality is less critical than with most instruments, but  it's still  worth getting a decent one. American brands like Valco, Magnatone,  Gibson, and Fender are recommended over the slightly cheaper Asian  imports, but unlike many other kinds of instruments even the cheap Asian  lap steels tend to be playable.

There  are some really good custom makers out there who charge pretty  modest  prices for instruments with real character, such as Clay Alden,  who  uses recycled barn wood and can burn patterns into it with electricity.

Lap  steels are relatively easy to make compared to most instruments.  Since  there are no frets, it's like an electric guitar where the neck  shape  doesn't matter and only needs to be strong, so you can get a cheap   electric with a bad neck as parts. Take a board and put the head stock   of the electric guitar on one end and the pickups near the other end.   Then you just need a nut and bridge, which will need little grooves   sawed or filed into them at a slightly wider spacing than a regular  guitar. There are many details to do a good job but it's an easy home   experiment to try.

Pedal steel  guitar is the sound of the instrumental solos between the  voice in  country music. It is a complex, expensive, difficult instrument but  highly versatile, being used in all genres of popular  music for a  unique sound. It is electric like a lap steel but has ten or twelve  strings and stands on legs like a table. It has usually between three  and nine foot pedals, which stretch or loosen individual strings or  small groups of them to change the notes they are tuned to.

It  can also have up to six knee levers that do this. These link to a   complex mechanism under the instrument, and allow many more three and   four note chords to be possible than on Dobro or lap steel. Beginners   are usually advised to buy a used professional quality instrument with   at least three foot pedals and four knee levers in the E9 tuning, and  have it evaluated by someone who knows what they're doing.

Some  notable pedal steel guitar players are Buddy Emmons (THE player,  did  amazing jazz on it), Jerry Garcia with Grateful Dead (check out  Dire  Wolf), Joe Wright, BJ Cole, and Paul Franklin.

Two  things really set the steel guitar family apart for me: it doesn't take  the calluses and hand strength of regular guitar, and it lets you  play  with a purer tuning. It is possible to play in perfect just  intonation  on these instruments, which gives them a beautiful ringing  quality."

WhatMusicalinstrument,foyskc9,t3_fyc2po,1588178388.0,"Thanks for the sub, and for the invitation to write about steel guitar here (see my recent post)!

I'm originally a clarinet player and it's still my primary gigging instrument during non-Covid times. I play clarinet and Irish flute in a world folk band that plays mostly Irish and klezmer for contra dances.

Lately I've branched out into the string world, and am obsessed with steel guitar. I have a Gretsch dobro, a custom 8-string lap steel by Clay Aldon, and a 12-string E9 pedal steel. Before I got some better steel instruments I made a lap-banjo, but it leaves a bit to be desired...

I'm also trying to learn mandolin on a really cheap slightly busted mando made in the '40s.

Edit: why I play them - 

Clarinet - I have a love-hate relationship with this beast. It is THE most expressive and versatile one-note-at-a-time instrument, up there with the violin family and the horn. The reeds are finicky and I've hurt myself both in the hands and the throat/jaw area from poor posture and technique. It's not an instrument to play casually but has an amazing sound like nothing else (literally - it is acoustically nearly unique in that it skips every other overtone).

Irish flute - It's probably the easiest way to play folk melodies other than the whistle, and it's mellower and easier to play in tune than the whistle is. It can be very expressive and play very fast, but has kind of limited range and can only play well in a few keys.

Dobro - I love the strange, expressive tone. Also it can play in harmony unlike wind instruments, and is way easier on your hands than regular guitar is.

Lap steel - sometimes you want to play something like a Dobro but want electric. They're easy to get or make in 8-string varieties, which opens up the harmonic possibilities a lot. They're great for playing a melody with full chords under it, or for playing fills behind a singer.

Pedal steel - I have very little technique on this beast yet. It's an amazing instrument, able to play full rich harmony and melody at the same time, with more perfect tuning than is possible on a regular guitar or a piano, and with more expressiveness. I think it might be the ultimate instrument in a certain peculiar way, combining the expressiveness of the clarinet with some of the capabilities of a piano."

ENFP,foqome6,t3_g7zto9,1587997948.0,"Yeah, totally. I've kind of made peace with this by realizing that we're in a culture that over-values elite specialization, and there is human value in being a person with many areas of interest.

But it sure helps to succeed at something you enjoy for a living. So my therapist asked me a powerful question:

If you woke tomorrow and found a miracle happened, one possibly attainable thing changed to be exactly how you dream it could be, what is it?

So I picked one of my many projects I'm always poking at and we made a plan how I'm going to spend a certain number of hours each week on it and for now I'm not going to also try to finish that novel or write a computer game or, or, ...all the things I switch to when things get hard.

But functional thinking I think is valuable. Thinking in terms of where the state is in a system, and what you can control if you only control a certain interface - a system you're trying to hack is a black box in many cases, just like the input/output of a function if you only know the signature. 

Thinking about whether that function is stateless or whether you can change something through repeated requests is definitely interesting."
SongWriter,fnvskwi,t3_g3w0aa,1587303618.0,"No, and here's why:

I'm a beginning song writer, coming from a background of being a lifelong poetry writer.

In poetry, they often teach free writing. You just write, as fast as possible, anything that comes into your head. Don't stop for 20 minutes or whatever duration you pick. Now you know it's possible. You can always write - something.

It's then a matter of quality. If you have writer's block it just means everything you could write doesn't pass your current standards you're holding yourself to. But when creating isn't the time to also judge. You do that after. So write a bad song. You might be surprised that part is actually good in a new way.

I highly recommend the book the Artist's Way for this."

I'm also very fond of Carl Maria Von Weber's second clarinet concerto. The last movement is super showy and does a really interesting thing messing with sonata form, if I analyzed it correctly during school - when the original theme returns, it's a half step higher than at the start, and does a false start like that for a few bars and kind of dies out, and then sinks down a half step and then is able to finish. Like the whole thing got too excited and crept sharp and then had to chill out before the insane finale could happen. Some subtle musical humor in that thing!"

I forget who said that, but it's true. It takes effort to be succinct. Paragraph breaks help organize ideas and catch redundancy. 

Once you've written everything, editing and moving stuff around helps organize the flow of ideas.

Anxiety,fn6upw8,t3_fzm0k0,1586707726.0,"Yes! It's a delicate balance for me though. I tried to kill my anxiety through a life of total hedonism for a while and it made it worse. I spent my time on various substances and playing computer games, including MMOs. For some people maybe that's their thing, but for me an escape was different from doing something truly enjoyable.

What I've been working towards now is recognizing when I want fun and when I'm trying to numb myself to the anxiety. In the latter case, it's better to choose something anxiety-reducing rather than distracting.

I've also found that caffeine, weed, and alcohol are not friends to anxiety. Caffeine especially, actually.

So I've been trying to balance challenging, fulfilling activities with self care and easy entertainment. Sometimes a hot bath is better than a show. Depends what you need. 

With the skills based activities, I'm trying to stick with one until it is actually successful so I don't just keep doing the easy part and then quitting for something else. You don't get the deep payoff if it's always just at the dreaming and dabbling stage."

The characters will then do what they want with little say from me, but there are many opportunities to throw events their way that doesn't things in an interesting direction. 

I'm not able to get to analytical about my characters and their motivations without killing my ability to see them as distinct personalities unfortunately, so I have to pretend I can't control them."
storyandstyle,fn6sic2,t1_fn5bjan,1586706473.0,"That's an interesting take. I think you may be right. The only ""truth"" one can discover through writing is ones own internal state, which is not a source of truth regarding the outside world. 

Reframing things in terms of that, I guess what I'm groping towards is an idea of emotional authenticity over conscious messages to the audience. 

There's one thing that still makes me question the idea of truth in fiction - perhaps it's not so much about discovering truth by one writing method or another, but about how truth is represented in a story. 

Should we be concerned with the effects of what we read or write on our subconscious perception of the world? Has a steady diet of thrillers taught us that life is dangerous on some level? Has portrayal of drug users always been linked with violence in a way that makes us assume they're dangerous criminals? I think fiction as reinforcement of the dominant social norm can be an impediment to change, and fiction that deviates from it a catalyst for change."

There's an important distinction, though. I totally agree with what he says about focus and not wasting your energy, not distracting yourself, and limiting your cheap dopamine hits. When you play games that give you an artificial sense of accomplishment (especially ones with achievements and a time grind rather than skill for success!), you're tricking your brain into thinking it has been successful without accomplishing anything real. But at the same time, you don't want to burn out.

What I've learned is that Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs is really important. Have lofty goals? Great. Also feel you need time off / to have fun? Great. But instead of the cycle of pushing yourself, then avoiding your dreams and distracting yourself with easy fun, the missing link is self care. Why are you stressed? Why are you hurting? Why are you frustrated or bored with the thing you think is your passion? Don't distract yourself, but don't just push through either. Slow down and get to the bottom of it.

For me it's been anxiety and physical pain from thoracic outlet syndrome. It messed up my music career. The answer isn't to make yourself practice six hours a day through pain. The answer is to see someone for the anxiety and work out to fix the pain. Things like that. Until your basic needs are being met well, you can't pursue higher goals."
