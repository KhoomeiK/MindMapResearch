Gear360,fqkjzjx,t1_fpdzdbm,1589429012.0,You might have to borrow a phone from your Android friend. Or maybe take it to a Samsung store and use one of the floor models to adjust the exposure.
Gear360,fqkjqor,t3_gcnuly,1589428854.0,"Regarding Quinny898’s comment, I can confirm that:
1. 2016 model doesn’t show live view in Google street view. You have to take the photo blindly. The process is also very slow; the time that it takes to download and stitch the pictures is like 10 seconds aka an eternity. 
2. 2016 model doesn’t connect iOS’ gear 360 app which defeats the purpose of being a 360 camera.  
3. 2017 DOES connect to iOS’ gear 360 but from my experience (I’m using iPhone 7 Plus), there are frequent connection dropouts and sometimes restarting the camera doesn’t fix the issue. 

Although I haven’t try to connect the 2017 model to street view app yet. I’ll report later today if it shows live view or not."
Asphalt8,fqkia86,t1_fqimvgc,1589427910.0,Yeah right. Forgot about the abundance of the car.
Asphalt8,fqhgsd4,t3_giu8sj,1589376677.0,Got it. Is it good for MP?
chiangmai,fqadv3n,t1_fq9zvyw,1589217396.0,"This might be a digression but if you know a little about Thai schooling, there’s an I-guess-it’s-called regulation where it says all kids must get 12 years of education. And of course society isn’t perfect; some people live in poverty and access to education for them would’ve been nonexistent without the help of government. In Thailand, studying at temples is the most inexpensive way to get education, some temples may even offer them for free (I’m not sure if it’s still a thing or not nowadays)."
Asphalt8,fnve4xd,t1_fnv40ed,1587289884.0,"Excuse me, do you have the article for this?"
Asphalt8,fnug0fc,t1_fnkoq3w,1587261227.0,"Well lately Gameloft have been trying to get us away from A8 and move to A9 probably because it’s a waste of time for them to maintain the server for A8. As a result of that, credit farming, upgrading pro kits on cars using fusion coins, is now harder than ever. Boosters are now a lot more expensive. They probably want to squeeze as much money from players as possible before they stop caring about A8."
Asphalt8,fnuf537,t1_fnsg989,1587260655.0,I perfected the technique you’re saying and it doesn’t really help. This car is just trash at drifting. Fast cars with trash drift ability are a nightmare to drive.
chiangmai,fnhzsdi,t1_fnhy4do,1586971571.0,Cool!

Asphalt8,fngfjls,t1_fn0bxmt,1586930657.0,Ah ok! Thank you for the explanation.
Asphalt8,fngfgb4,t3_g1ktyz,1586930578.0,I think this will be the last piece of gift we will ever get in asphalt 8.
Asphalt8,fmz9mvy,t1_fmgzzld,1586511898.0,I have made my decision to not buy it. Thank you for your suggestion.
Asphalt8,fmgy9j9,t1_fmgw59w,1586061131.0,Really? Will it still be worth it if there’s a discount?
Asphalt8,fmgvsy0,t1_fmdw7gz,1586059174.0,Thanks but what is class king exactly?
Asphalt8,fmdw3sp,t1_fmdvltr,1585979876.0,We’ll wait and see the suggestions from other people. I want to know too.
Asphalt8,fmdvjc1,t3_funnik,1585979332.0,I’m not aware that Asphalt 8 for iOS is hackable but I’ll stick around. My guess is that jailbreaking is the only way to go.
Asphalt8,fm7sjbe,t1_fm7eu7f,1585835839.0,Unless you Pro it. Not really.

Asphalt8,fm7rnec,t1_fm57klh,1585835283.0,I can confirm on your point that it’s the server issue. I’m on iOS and I have the same problem. Looks like they are eager to kill the game now.
Asphalt8,flcpqc7,t1_flaayrz,1585041083.0,Yeah that’s what I would’ve done if I got those cards.
Asphalt8,flc9gaf,t1_flc9em4,1585023484.0,I’ll look into that. Thank you.
Asphalt8,flc8o7n,t1_fl79uyn,1585022860.0,I don’t think iOS has that option. Or does it?
Asphalt8,fl6xaih,t3_fmwp2z,1584886594.0,I chose the bmw. Let’s see if I made the wrong decision. If you have tips or tricks let me know thx.

chiangmai,fiw0j6g,t1_fivciu3,1582772272.0,Makes sense. Apple Iconsiam was first opened in November of 2018.
jailbreak,fda120c,t1_fd9zxkb,1578240430.0,Ohh yeah forgot about the A12 thing. Sorry for your inconvenience
jailbreak,fd9y8uk,t1_fd9xs8o,1578239487.0,"It works. But I’m sorry I didn’t read your comment carefully. You said [[Pivot]] interfered with your other tweaks. What I meant was an alternative tweak for pivot is [[SBFlip]]. 

It works. You can try it. Works both on my iOS 10.4.4 iPhone 5 and iOS 13.2.2 iPhone 7."

jailbreak,f9dh3go,t1_f9biw50,1575233476.0,I couldn’t agree more. I trust this jailbreak so much that I installed it on my primary iPhone.
chiangmai,f94trin,t1_f94smks,1575103011.0,Thank you for suggesting sir. I didn’t know group existed. Now I’m not in need of information anymore so I’ll leave this post up.

chiangmai,f94rart,t1_f94gw30,1575099520.0,There’s not much information on this topic available on the internet and I also don’t know any local people that knows this deeply.
chiangmai,f5w2xym,t1_f5w2dko,1572512322.0,That’s good. There’re plenty of dentists in Chiang Mai (plenty of good ones as well. )  The place you went to is also good. I had no idea of the bill there because I was too young the last time I was there. I’m glad you’re satisfied.
chiangmai,f4fckgh,t3_dkhdym,1571568888.0,"I recommend you to go to Grace Dental Care Clinic. It’s located near Nimman Haemin road. They deal with international patients all the time, don’t fret. I had my cavity filled last year and they charged reasonably."
chiangmai,f3t38vy,t1_f3t1hrz,1571116873.0,They say it’s prohibited but the fact is nobody cares. It’s a “cultural” thing that is hard to change.
chiangmai,f2hqtmy,t1_f2hl50c,1570247030.0,"I’d like to add more information to this. When you go shopping online especially on Lazada, try to find and  read as much information as possible. Some third-party sellers on Lazada has a reputation of selling product that is not what they described. There’re also some fake reviews, look out for that. Official stores tend to be more trustable; Apple Flagship store, Samsung flagship store, etc.
Enjoy shopping."

ios13beta,extnw58,t3_cud9p5,1566571977.0,Man I have similar problem with the home screen. iOS 13 beta would get buggy from time to time on my iPhone. My explanation for the picture is that it’s a bug.
