MonsterHunterWorld,fqxjz0r,t3_glh3qn,1589733464.0,Especially going into the guiding lands
StarWars,fqq0nlj,t1_fqpwuhq,1589557368.0,I‚Äôm so glad they did
MonsterHunterWorld,fqlafuf,t3_gjizdr,1589451937.0,Jealous
MonsterHunterWorld,fqin1k1,t3_gj45d1,1589398181.0,What a big cunt
modernwarfare,fq9s2yz,t1_fq9rr5l,1589205881.0,I agree 100%. Mw2 maps were classics. I really hope to see a couple in Mw2019 bc I‚Äôve found myself ranking the maps now from least hated to most hated lol
modernwarfare,fq9q1k8,t1_fq9pzj1,1589204633.0,Yea I do miss the prestige system tbh
modernwarfare,fq9psku,t3_ghndx0,1589204478.0,This is my favorite CoD since MW2. And imo the best one since MW2. Despite all the bs in this game I love it. But I believe it excels in MP not WZ
Coronavirus,fq6419s,t1_fq60wos,1589124048.0,"I live in NYC and work in the gentrified part of BK (Greenpoint/Williamsburg) and I can tell you in the parks, white people are not following social distancing and are probably doing it worse than blacks are. They‚Äôre out in huge numbers and in the more popular parks, its worse. No masks, no social distancing. I even saw cops giving out masks to some of them. But its because they are in gentrified and more upper class areas opposed to the low income areas where blacks are violating these rules. Not fair tbh."
StarWars,fq44vu7,t1_fq3szcb,1589073684.0,Did the same thing lol
modernwarfare,fpwfl4z,t3_gfxa42,1588962581.0,I hate shipment. But I‚Äôm never able to back out of it whenever it comes up. Theres just something about it lol
StarWarsBattlefront,fpw3uzz,t1_fpw39zu,1588956795.0,Cinematic and immersive are the exact words I‚Äôd use. And yea for me era restricted heroes is something I‚Äôm here for even though the majority of others aren‚Äôt. It doesnt kill the game for me but I prefer it
StarWarsBattlefront,fpw21k1,t1_fpw1vmm,1588955892.0,Very good points. CS needs a lot of work and all those additions would help. And yea GA sometimes has too many heroes for my liking.
StarWarsBattlefront,fpvuqqi,t1_fpvuh6l,1588952194.0,I never really found fun in doing the same thing on different maps. Do you enjoy CS more than GA?
StarWarsBattlefront,fpvtxxh,t1_fpvtmlg,1588951776.0,It just feels underwhelming to me

modernwarfare,fpobrzy,t1_fpob8j8,1588781815.0,"I love the game but I can recognize its flaws even when I may not experience all of them. It doesn‚Äôt mean other people aren‚Äôt experiencing the problem. 

As for the devs, they‚Äôre a whole other story lol and when it comes down to it, its a whole lot of frustration"
modernwarfare,fpoagoi,t1_fpo9yen,1588781167.0,Thank you for sharing! It most likely was lol

modernwarfare,fpo5ho6,t3_gem1te,1588778722.0,Its happens almost every time I thrown one and sometimes it glitches out worse than this instance. I wish I had more clips but I always forget to record the moment. Obviously not game breaking but still pretty annoying and wondering if anyone has dealt with this. I‚Äôm on Xbone X.
MonsterHunterWorld,fpnn2qc,t3_gdxn3c,1588767885.0,Guys this was just a vid to show me get completely obliterated. Not to argue on how or why it happened. Just enjoy :D
