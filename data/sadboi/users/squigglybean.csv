If you're asking if anyone else had a similar situation where they moved in with their girlfriend and she started to believe she was a vampire who wanted to get you intoxicated before doing BDSM that you don't enjoy or feel comfortable with, she may be deflecting but you are in denial.

Picture a future with this person. You know it's escalating because you describe it escalating in your post. What kind of vampire is she going to be in 2 years? You are not overthinking, in my opinion, you may be underthinking.

If you have tried telling your romantic partner that they are making you uncomfortable with the sexual things they're doing and they don't care, don't respect your boundaries, and tell you to just get fucked up, there aren't many other options other than walking away or accepting the situation for what it is and accepting that it probably won't change.

bipolar,fli00n5,t1_flhxsdi,1585172703.0,"If you're interested in some of the weird things that helped me, these are things my therapist had shown me and we had talked about over the years. Transactional analysis, freudian psychology, existentialist philosophy, and Albert Camus' ""The Myth of Sisyphus"" which talks about how the chaos and meaninglessness of life and existence and careers makes us all feel depressed/suicidal and how creating your own meaningful existence based on what is important to you personally can help mitigate those feelings. He also talked a lot about ""Eastern gurus,"" but that wasn't really my thing so I didn't look into it too much.

It's not for everyone. Before doing these things, I was a wreck for years. I dealt with suicidal thoughts constantly, self-injured, hospitalized several times, arrested during manic episodes, running away from my family. Very textbook bipolar for years. I had been reliant on medication for 11 years, I told myself there was nothing I could do to fix it, that I would be on them forever, but I kept going to therapy and reading about psychology and the brain anyways, I did the 12 step program (Nar-Anon, I have friends who are addicts and they stress me out lol). It kind of all fell into place to the point that I looked at the world and myself and my life in such a drastically different way that I don't feel depressed anymore. Even with everything going on with the pandemic, losing my job, worrying about finances, my husband being in the hospital. I've been calm, normal levels of stress. Still sleeping, still eating, still taking care of myself. 

For me personally, I don't believe I was ever randomly depressed or randomly manic. The more I reflected on my life and what was going on and what I was really thinking and feeling about things, there was always a trigger for my moods.

I don't know. I probably sound preachy, I don't mean to be. These are just the things that worked for me, if they worked for me, they might work for someone else. I would hate to not share what worked for me just because it's not conventional."

...Why would you be worried about trying to be ""politically correct""? Politically correct is just a conservative term for ""not a fucking asshole."" Gossiping isn't bad either, sociologists and psychologists say it's a healthy way for people to bond by talking about mutual acquaintances. Yeah, don't shit talk your friends, but talking about them isn't bad.

And it's literally impossible to never get upset. You're a human being. You have emotions. You are going to get upset. It is way healthier to just say out loud ""I am upset."" than to pretend you are some perfect, godly man, and then turn around and treat a girl like shit.

Most girls don't actually give a shit about all that stuff. But we're best friends, he's confident being his true self, he makes me laugh, and we have fun together. That's really all it's about.

Have you tried eating Keto? I'm sorry I had to suggest it, I hate that I've become one of those people. I never wanted to be one of those weirdos that preaches about weird dieting habits.

I lost 30 pounds without trying, I had so much more energy, self-confidence was higher, I felt more stable and clear-minded mentally.

for real. it isn't enough to just shower and be nice. you have to have confidence. it attracts people and opportunities to you, not just women. without confidence, people won't want to be around you, no matter what you have to offer, because you are projecting outwardly that you have nothing to offer. therapy is a great place to learn and build self-confidence and raise your self-esteem. 

there's nothing wrong with being a virgin at any age, or never having a relationship. but it will hurt you long-term to not have self-confidence, with more than just relationships. you said you're planning on going to college, you'll make more friends, find more opportunities, and have better job prospects if you work on raising your self-esteem and self-confidence.

also, speaking from experience, it's WAY easier to find a girl you actually like if you think about just making friends with people, including girls, and let it flow naturally. if you try and force a connection with someone because they're attractive or your type, the relationship won't feel as right or be as fun."

insanepeoplefacebook,flfh3zu,t1_flfdvcu,1585106420.0,"masculine behaviors are not toxic. being a man is not toxic. there is NOTHING wrong with masculinity, being proud of being a man, or anything like that. i love masculinity, i love the things men do that make them men.

""toxic masculinity"" is a concept about how sexism in a patriarchal society socializes boys to be violent and aggressive. not all men are sexist or violent. it isn't an insult for masculine. men are not fragile and they have just as much emotional control as women. they are being hurt by the same fucked up power structure that hurts women.

toxic masculinity is the idea that men are violent just for being men, that they can't help it, making excuses for men who hurt others saying ""boys will be boys"" implying that men are too stupid to control themselves. that men have to be self-reliant and repress their emotions to be men, leading to depression, addiction, and suicide. it hurts men, it leads to a lower life span, higher rates of violent deaths, higher rates of liver cirrhosis.

there is nothing wrong with regular masculinity. i love that my husband wants to be a provider, loves his career. studies have shown that men are actually more romantic in relationships, they are more likely to pick a partner because ""she's my soulmate"" as opposed to women that on average pick partner's for practical reasons.

my biggest issue with toxic masculinity is both how it negatively affects the men in my life, but also the confusion with the term leading to them trying to force more feminine qualities just to show emotions. emotions, crying, asking for help are not inherently womanly qualities. men should feel comfortable to be human beings without feeling like they have to compromise their masculinity, thus the concept of toxic masculinity."

He came home safely and asked for mental help, I called 911 and he was not arrested (to my knowledge, not sure if he has been since) and he went voluntarily to the emergency room. I was able to talk to him around 2 am last night, I called to check again this morning and they said he will be admitted to inpatient as soon as a bed opens up. Even with everything going on, my mental health has never been better, it's hard not to feel guilty about that. I weirdly feel like I should be more stressed or hurting since he's hurting, but that won't help anyone. I have to be strong and hold down the house and take care of things while he is getting medical help. I would never enable an addict I love, no drugs or alcohol. I'm not a professional, he needs professional help. My role is to love him, stand by his side proudly in sickness and in health, to try and protect him from his family of origin, and call 911 when he's in crisis.

Honestly it just sucks that it's Sunday, people aren't usually released from inpatient on weekends, meaning a bed probably won't open up until tomorrow, and he's stuck in limbo between the emergency room and inpatient. I wish I could be there with him for support but with coronavirus they aren't allowing visitors, I won't even be able to visit him in inpatient.

It fucking sucks being home alone during this while he is in a hospital alone. I wish we were together in bed watching TV like normal, but he is safe and healthy and that's all that matters. I can handle mental illness and addiction, those are fixable. I wouldn't be able to cope well with him trying to come up with a permanent solution to a temporary problem.
