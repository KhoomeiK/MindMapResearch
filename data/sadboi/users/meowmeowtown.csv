It ain’t always easy but when I start feeling the bad thoughts coming back I write down things I’m good at, proud of myself for, or like about myself. 
Hard to start, but once you get momentum or keep it up when the lows swing back around it’s easier to change your mindset and mood (: 
Hope it helps! I have some resources from the therapist if you need (:"

curlyhair,esnj20s,t3_c8ki5e,1562134376.0,"My routine: 

Wash with baking soda and water - scrub into scalp with finger tips and “lather” working through to ends 

Rinse with apple cider vinegar - combing with a wide tooth comb 

Squeeze as much water out of hair with hair turban and then liberally spray with sea salt spray and leave to dry. 

As I’m swimming in the ocean almost daily this seems to be the best method for me. 
Using leave in conditioners and gels/mouses just seems to weigh my hair down or leave if super stiff and rigid which I dislike personally. 

Have tried almost a hundred different probably, and so far this is my favourite result."
