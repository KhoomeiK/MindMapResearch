internetparents,fqeuedg,t1_fqesybe,1589313754.0,"So after I was hospitalized they started me on medication and more frequent therapy. Those things both really help, but I won’t deny that you have to put in the work to get better. Therapy and medication bring you halfway there. Being able to talk to someone about my problems and get into them and realize why I act the way I do and how to use tools to replace the unhealthy behavior with healthy behavior was huge. And putting a support system in place (having a safety plan, knowing which friends I can talk to about certain subjects that bother me, having my therapist on call) was probably the best thing I did to make sure that if it does get worse, I have actions I can take to prevent that. Again, going to the hospital is not inherently bad. It’s just a sign that you need a little more support.   So seek out a therapist and nurse practitioner. It might take a while to find good ones. If you don’t click with a therapist, go to a new one. Reach out to friends and open up to them. I started doing that and so many people started reaching back saying that they also struggle with the same disorders I do and they 100% understand me. In truth, once I started opening up about my self harm, I started an anonymous list and realized that 32 people I know also self harmed. And that was so validating. And just having the knowledge that I can lean on friends, family, and professionals if I need help has aided tremendously in recovery."
internetparents,fqesnn0,t1_fqeqwng,1589312935.0,"It actually really did save my life. I realized that there was a lot of people like me out there and a lot of other people also struggled with their mental health. I was a sanctuary for me; it was a place that I could put everything else out of my mind and just focus on recovery. It was a sign that I was deserving of help, and that help is out there. I know other people don’t have the positive experience I had with it, but I think it can jumpstart you into seeking a level of help you’re comfortable with, and also gives you motivation to recover (ie I don’t want to go back there so I have to take positive steps such as xyz). Going to a hospital seems like hitting rock bottom, but that just means you have nowhere to go but up. Going to a hospital isn’t punishment. It simply gives you resources you can use to help yourself out of the dark place. If you do lose all control, you can always go back and seek help there. It isn’t a bad thing to go. If you decide to go back it means that you are choosing to get help instead of letting the demons win."

I take it you’ve never had depression before since it makes even the smallest tasks 100x harder because you had to fight your own thoughts every step of the way. These “excuses” of not going to the dentist are actually thoughts that pop into your head brought on by depression. OP isn’t choosing not to go to the dentist, they simply weren’t in a place where they could fend off those thoughts depression put in their brain."
internetparents,fpi7ffc,t3_gdknwt,1588635170.0,"As someone who has gone through depression myself, I totally get the feeling of being a burden. I think at this point you were right to go to the emergency department (i’m from the US so I apologize for not knowing the terminology you use). If this is preventing you from drinking water and such then I would go back to the emergency department and tell them that. See if the meds help, and if they don’t then I think you should specifically request it to be pulled at the emergency department that is open because it’s not an elective surgery anymore; this is something you need in order to drink water and live. I also want to point out that the depression is not your fault. It’s really hard to deal with all the consequences it brings and not going to appointments is unfortunately one of them. So yeah you /could/ have technically gone to the dentist, but you had a very real disease working against you and I think that you should realize and validate that."
mentalillness,fpi6hnj,t3_gdkpcx,1588634630.0,"
I would say yes. An eating disorder is basically any unhealthy relationship with food. What you have is most likely OSFED (used to be EDNOS in previous versions of the DSM) which stands for otherwise specified feeding and eating disorder. You don’t have to fit into the box of bulimia or anorexia to have an eating disorder. They come in all shapes and forms with all different symptoms. Ideally you want to get to a place where you stop restricting and stop purging entirely. And where you view food as fuel that you need for your body to function. I also have OSFED and you’re welcome to DM me if you want to hear more of my story and how I handle it!"

selfharm,fpes4ki,t1_fpe0zwe,1588553769.0,Oh I also forgot to answer the second part of your question. I generally don’t use rubbing alcohol on cuts because it can do more damage to exposed healthy cells that it does to clean the wound. You should use antibiotic ointment/cream on those

BipolarReddit,fpers4y,t1_fpdisu7,1588553561.0,"It really depends on the person and the side effects vs how well it’s working for you. I was on Zoloft for a little bit, and it did help, so we upped the dose. Then it got detrimental so I stopped. With the Seroquel I kept increasing without any additional side effects. I finally decided to leave it at 600mg since it was doing its job very well and there wasn’t a need to increase it. So it’s basically up to you and your body. If you go through a nurse practitioner they won’t up your dose if it’s not safe or it’s too soon."

selfharm,fpc1aom,t3_gcl3g5,1588484467.0,I personally enjoy arm sleeves. You can get them in various styles like fishnet and they keep you cool while also adding to your fashion statement
selfharm,fpc16ok,t3_gcl60r,1588484372.0,"I don’t encourage it, but if you can’t be dissuaded from it, don’t use rubbing alcohol. That ends up damaging your healthy cells more than cleaning a wound out. You do, however, want to clean your tools in alcohol. For the actual wounds, you want warm soapy water and antibacterial ointment/cream. Keep them mostly covered until it starts to scab. Honestly though, don’t try it. I know first hand how dangerous it can become. You start small and your body heals it just fine, but then you want to go deeper. I’ve cut on my thigh and woke up with a limp the next day. I’ve known people that cut and have gotten a staph infection and had to be on antibiotics. I’ve also known people who have severed a nerve. Do you know how painful that is? There is so much potential to cut a vein or an artery, or get down to the layer of fat, and in those cases you NEED to go to the hospital to get it taken care of. You’ll have scars for the rest of your life and people will be rude and ask about them and treat you differently just because you have them. This can become a physical addiction. Cutting produces endocannibinoids in your brain (basically a natural form a morphine) and you can become hooked on the feeling they give you which makes it so so so hard to stop. I’ve had this addiction for 7 years and i’m just starting to get clean. The only way to 100% prevent all these things from happening is don’t start in the first place."

You can cut into veins and arteries. You can sever tendons and nerves. You can get an infection from a fat cut that goes into your blood stream and causes sepsis. You can loose a limb from  infection, or even your life. Yes, it starts out as little things that your body heals no problem. But it always always has the potential to become an issue that could cost you more than you bargained for."
internetparents,fp46xro,t3_gb6q0m,1588292908.0,"I think that having a job might actually give you some real world experiences you can use to start your own company. If you go into a lower level position, you can see how the chain of command works in an already successful business. Get a job and use it for experience. Once you start a job, there’s nothing that says you can’t quit and start your business at any point in time. Plus, you get to have an appreciation for how much work actually goes into making things run smoothly and can lead in a way that is intuitive to keeping employees happy and loyal. You seem very young and while yes, you can create a business at a young age, it might be worthwhile to get some experience under your belt unless you have someone else with a lot of knowledge to guide you in the business department."

Keep in mind I don’t eat a lot of sugar so I think they’re fine but you might think they’re bitter as hell lol. If you want that sweet candy taste but don’t like the sugar content, you can actually make your own fudge. I take cocoa powder in a glass, add 1 spoonful of sugar (you can customize it to your liking) a splash of water and microwave it for 10 seconds. Then you mix it all up and eat it. It’s warm and a perfect small snack that I can eat without feeling guilty about eating a bunch of sugar. And it’s so customizable since you can make as much as you want and add as little sugar as you want and cocoa powder is only $5 and it lasts for months. It’s not really convenient but if you want to wean yourself off of sugar and don’t want to go cold turkey it might help."
selfharm,fp05o4z,t1_fp036o8,1588202955.0,Yeah you can do walk ins but sometimes you have to wait is the only thing. But it’s totally valid. I’ve only done blood on the off season since i’m an athlete.
selfharm,fp019my,t3_gaja7v,1588200602.0,Ive donated blood several times before. It’s not a bad process. Idk if you have scars but I’ve been asked about my (fresh) ones before. It actually gave me so much anxiety my heartbeat was over 100 (I normally have a heart rate in the 80s) so I couldn’t donate since it was so high. But all the other times it’s was definitely nice to see the blood coming out. They normally hang the bag below you but you can still stare at the needle.

I would recommend an antibacterial/antibiotic ointment and soap and water. Clean bandages should keep bacteria and debris out while it’s still healing up until it’s scabbed.

fuckeatingdisorders,foz08b4,t3_gadjbx,1588182420.0,"I think the best course of action is to directly ask your partner what actions would be the best to take. Since EDs very so much from anorexia to binge eating disorder to pica to not otherwise specified, it’s hard to generalize any advice without knowing specifics. Some questions you can ask your partner to jumpstart this conversation: are you comfortable with me asking about your disorder and how to help you? (If no, don’t proceed). How would you like me to act around you eating (not make a big deal out of it, encourage you to eat, encourage you to take smaller portions, ignore it, etc)? If I see you’re struggling what would be the best course of action (ask you about it, give you a distraction, mind my own business)? Is there anything else you want me to know about your disorder? Ask questions with plenty of options so she doesn’t feel put on the spot. Plus some people don’t know what would help them best so giving them some direction gets them thinking."

It was really hard having everyone just assume I was straight and not being able to feel 100% like myself. Once I came out, it felt so relieving and I was so glad I did it. So I feel you’d have the same experience with your religion.

Antipsychiatry,foolmpf,t1_foof9l9,1587941439.0,"Bipolar is a classification of symptoms. If someone has memory loss, mental decline, confusion in the evening hours, disorientation, inability to speak or understand language, making things up, mental confusion, or inability to recognize common things we say they have dementia. Similarly, if someone has high energy, reduced need for sleep, and loss of touch with reality sometimes but also low energy, low motivation, and loss of interest in daily activities other times we say they have bipolar. How is labeling dementia different from labeling bipolar disorder? They’re both labels defined by humans. Why is one label correct to use but another label isn’t? I’m not trying to say you do have bipolar or you don’t. But I think it’s valid that some people use it as a label for their symptoms so they can easily identify other people that they can relate. So instead of saying I have a, b, c, x, y, z symptoms, they can just say I have x. And i’m not saying that bipolar really exists or that it doesn’t really exist. Just that it’s a tool humans have made in order to satisfy the biological need to connect and fit in with others. So what’s the harm in reclaiming a label?"

I’ve been so so lucky that the only side effect I’ve had is drowsiness, and since I have insomnia, I can actually sleep at night without having to take an additional med. but we should be very careful about giving people medication and make sure there aren’t any bad side effects and let them decide if they want to take on the risks. I know that there is a real possibility of them not working. I think it’s more of a “quality of life” decision. If you are having symptoms that are worse than the medications side effects, would it be worth trying it? And I do believe that if you use medication you also have to repair your life and actively change it because they meds cannot do that for you."
Antipsychiatry,foocxia,t3_g7euea,1587936760.0,"So I also partly agree with you. Nobody should be forced into a place they don’t want to be. And if they are, there shouldn’t be any lasting effects. However, I do disagree on psych wards being bad. Psych wards can be beneficial *if implemented correctly*. And I know a lot of them are not, and I don’t mean to invalidate anyone on their experiences, I just want to share mine. I’ve been to the ward 2 times. First time, I was forced. But then I got a taste of what an *effective* ward actually provides. The second time I actually admitted myself because I was so stressed out with schoolwork and college and feeling like I had to figure my whole life out in a very short period of time. The ward allowed me to figure my shit out while I was in a controlled environment and didn’t need to stress out about grades, what was going to happen next, etc. The one I went to allowed patients to walk with a staff members outside each morning, had a kitchen with a fridge that you were freely allowed to come and go, also a craft room and tv room you were also allowed to freely come and go. The staff were really nice and I had several nurses come in when I was crying and offer support and a listening ear while also respective my boundaries. I also met 6 other people there I consider good friends and still take to 3 years later. So, my point is, when these things are implemented correctly, it can actually help you depending on what you need it for. If you need a place to focus on yourself, or want a place for you to talk everyday so you can figure out your issues, a place like where I went to is great. And again, I acknowledge that not everyone has this experience, and i’m not trying to say they are wrong. I’m saying that sometimes a psych ward can be helpful in certain circumstances. And I know your friends mean well, I they wouldn’t have done it if they had known what you would go through in there. I think they wanted you to have an experience like I had. I am so sorry that you had a bad experience and it really sucks and isn’t fair."
rit,foo1yi0,t3_g8jptu,1587930910.0,"It does get cold and snowy in the winter, but it’s not really that hard to handle, and i’m normally a baby about being cold. As for friends, it’s suuuper easy to make some with over 300+ clubs you’re bound to find one you like. Not to mention living in dorms you get a lot of friends. There are some parties but they’re not a huge deal as most are here for academics. The gym is very nice and I love it. I’m also a student athlete and we get our own weightlifting rooms so you never have to share the public gym with a bunch of athletes. There’s a really nice swimming pool/Center too!"
BipolarReddit,fono2c8,t3_g8inyx,1587923164.0,I did lose weight but it was because of my eating disorder so all I can say is don’t do that because you’ll be miserable. Sounds like you’re doing healthy things and have already lost weight so continue to do those things and you’ll be on the right track. Personally I love running and have found that its fun while also helping me keep weight off now that i’m at a healthy weight again.
BipolarReddit,foiqfh9,t3_g7mxaw,1587793735.0,I’m on 600mg of Seroquel and 20mg of lexipro. I’ve been on Seroquel for 7 years (was actually the first drug I tried) and I really like it
tattoo,foiq8yk,t1_foipgq7,1587793578.0,Yeah it can get itchy. When that happens I “itch” it by putting a little moisturizer on it so i’m able to slide the flat part of my finger over it a couple times
internetparents,foiq4f2,t3_g7nli9,1587793469.0,"You are totally fine. To be honest drug tests aren’t very sensitive. If you took 2 puffs an hour or two before the test it wouldn’t pick you up because the amount  of it in your saliva is so small. If you had never smoked before and smoked a joint or bowl, you’d probably be safe around the 4 day mark. If you are a heavy/daily chronic user you’d have to wait about 30 days. (Both of these are regarding saliva tests) so any bit of weed you had in your system has completely left your system."
tattoo,foiov42,t3_g7n8ht,1587792397.0,Oh i get that too. Probably a little raised since your skin is a bit damaged so your body is trying to slowly get rid of the those cells.

rit,fo7cwum,t1_fo6bhdf,1587576191.0,RIT has a major housing shortage. They stupidly decided to sell one of their housing complexes to an outside company when there weren’t that many houses to begin with. It’s pretty expensive and you have to apply/Renew every year. Housing people take awhile to reply and generally aren’t the most helpful. It’s very hard to get in certain places due to demand and you’re more than likely to end up at someplace you don’t want. I actually asked to have summer housing and they told me they couldn’t place me until June. So I’d highly recommend going off campus housing as soon as possible because it’s just a headache to deal with housing every year. Not to mention the meal plans that come with them.

lgbt,fo3wl5y,t3_g5ke25,1587494167.0,In many cultures being trans/non binary is actually considered sacred. Take native Americans and the Two Spirit for example. Society and the culture you grow up in influence you biases. Just because you think one thing is wrong doesn’t mean it’s inherently wrong. Is eating shrimp wrong? Is wearing mixed fabrics wrong? The Bible tells us those things are wrong but you do those things regardless because you think they’re not actually wrong. At the end of the day we are all people with different beliefs and we need to respect those beliefs regardless of whether or not they align with our own beliefs. I’m not saying that you HAVE to like trans people. What i’m saying is that you have to at least give them dignity and respect like you would any other living being.
internetparents,fnua0b3,t3_g3wi0b,1587257622.0,By putting it in the fridge you’re slowing down the advancement of bacteria and stuff so you’re probably fine. It was probably someone who left their spaghetti out on the counter and let a bunch of bacteria grow unchecked.
lgbt,fntxnas,t1_fntxj6i,1587250568.0,Oh my mistake! Thanks for the correction
rit,fntuqjs,t3_g3wdli,1587248973.0,I asked them for more and they came back and gave me around $2k more. Doesn’t hurt to ask. Also check around and see if there’s any local scholarships in your area that can apply to.

fuckeatingdisorders,fntagpe,t3_g3rbwp,1587237762.0,"So an eating disorder is basically an unhealthy relationship/thoughts with food. That’s all you really need to have. There’s different types like binge eating disorder (eating a lot of food at once), bulimia (binging and then making yourself throw up), anorexia (starving), orthorexia (refusing to eat anything that’s not “healthy”), purging disorder (making yourself throw up without binging), Avoidant Restrictive Food and Intake Disorder (aka ARFID, where you are absolutely terrified to try new foods due to texture/taste), atypical anorexia (extreme dieting and lack of food intake to someone who isn’t underweight), pica (eating things that aren’t food ie chalk, paper, etc), and if none of those fit you there is always Otherwise Specified Feeding and Eating Disorder (aka OSFED, which covers anything else not defined in the DSM). Eating disorders can happen to anyone regardless of gender, weight, body type, race, disability, and more. No matter what you suffer with, you deserve to get help. You deserve happiness and to be healthy. I would recommend reaching out to someone you love and trust or a therapist. If you do want to lose weight, there’s tons of healthy ways to do so!! Eating disorders are absolutely terrible to have and you try everything to stop it before it becomes a problem.  It took me a while to come to terms with my eating disorder, and I still suffer from disordered thinking. But it’s worth it to reach out for help."
rit,fnt8fvu,t3_g3rq6h,1587236626.0,"I highly recommend this school if you have a good scholarship. Everyone here is so nerdy and passionate and I just felt immediately at home. I’m in computer science, not engineering, but I’ve only had 1 or 2 bad teachers in the 3 years I’ve been here. There are so many different clubs and sports and whatnot that it’s so easy to meet new people and stay as busy as you want. There are one or two downsides, like the school housing process, but other than that I really can’t complain."
mentalillness,fnt81h4,t3_g3r9gb,1587236400.0,"As someone who has admitted themselves to a hospital, if you feel like you need to go, you probably do. I went because I couldn’t stop self harming and I was having so much anxiety I couldn’t eat. It was so nice to be at a place where I knew I was safe and that I could work out my issues without having everything in my life interfere. I don’t know if you’ve been inpatient before, but the time I admitted myself it saved me. I made several friends in there, several of whom I still talk to today. In patient is there to help you get better in a safe and welcoming environment. It strips almost all the stressful environmental variables out. So if you think you can’t do this on your own, you should go. It’s better to be safe than sorry. If you have any questions about inpatient feel free to DM me."
therapy,fnt6tss,t3_g3rucr,1587235733.0,"So mandatory reporters normally are only required to report abuse or if someone else’s life is in danger. Sexual assault is also covered under this (at least on college campuses). It’s more to catch abuse before it escalates. Since this abuse is more about the relationship between two people, self harm is not typically considered something they must report. If you tell your therapist you self harm, they’ll normally discuss with you different coping strategies, the underlying emotions that urges you to cut, and only in extreme cases will hospitalize you (like if you used it as a suicide attempt). So you should be totally fine to talk to them about self harm. Out of personal experience, talking to my therapist about self harm has helped me greatly. I come up with a game plan of things I do when I get an urge. I would highly suggest bringing it up in a session. Hope that helps!"
lgbt,fnp14lt,t3_g30rgv,1587137387.0, Think it’s mainly to highlight that any person of color normally faces more discrimination and adverse side affects than their white counterparts. But saying “trans women of color” instead of “trans women” you are acknowledging that difference that POC trans vs white trans face.  So it’s a common curtesy thing and it helps combat POC erasure.
