Honestly I've been thinking about it and there's been huge weather changes (at least in my region) recently, general stress of a pandemic, changed routine, increased screen time, etc etc and I'm surprised more people haven't been complaining tbh"
migraine,fqo9oic,t1_fqktzlx,1589510467.0,"It definitely could be! I'm a software engineer by trade and while I was thinking there would be no difference in screen time I realize that I really am looking at screens a whole lot more. The time between commutes, going out to lunch, office talk, and occasional going out at night really make a difference. I don't get dry eyes but my vision has seemed a bit strained recently

And thanks for the advice! I'm going to try a heat pack and I'm seeing an allergist soon to try and see if that's maybe at least contributing"

lane8,fg35lmf,t3_ev8bkd,1580471263.0,Just messaged you!
premed,ffrxx4t,t1_ffqxata,1580168408.0,Thank you so much! That helped a lot. I'm not sure if I just didn't look hard enough or what but I couldn't find that information anywhere online
premed,ffpgbn6,t1_ffpe1n2,1580094346.0,"Yeah, sorry, I didn't really expand on that part. I guess I should've. I honestly want to do something that gives me meaning and helps people, and from the get-go in my life, becoming a doctor was what I wanted. My parents obviously pushed for it, but it was and still is all me. I am constantly reading research papers and following the latest news in my fields of interest within the medical field, and am actively pursuing and doing research outside of my job for the stats but also because I honestly enjoy it. I'm really into nutrition and exercise and the science behind it all, and am constantly buying things to get more data from my body and running little n=1 experiments on myself, and learning why my body responds this way. I also have this morbid fascination every time someone is in the hospital. I'd want nothing more than to be as involved and learn from as much of it as possible, which happened this past year when my younger brother got cancer. It happened while I was studying for MCAT, so I was in the library by day studying for the MCAT and at the hospital looking over his charts and asking as many questions as I could (without bothering the doctor in charge of his care too much haha). Stuff like that. The main point is, nothing makes me feel better than helping people and leaving a mark on the world, truly.


But I've also fallen in love with software engineering, and I'm working for an organization that is specifically only there to further science (albeit not medical, more like earth sciences, physics, planetary, I think you get the picture). I love that I'm able to be a small part in a big machine that's working on so many different problems that are important. The problem is, I've been feeling like the work I'm doing right now is insignificant. I'm just a small part in the machine and if I didn't do the work I'm doing right now nobody would be really worse off for it. More than likely, they would find someone else to do exactly that. The projects I'm working on currently also don't interest me much. But I'm unsure of whether these are truly valid concerns or not because it's likely the fact that I started approximately half a year ago, and things would get better. The fact that I might one day help further society in this manner really excites me, but ultimately it's not what I'm currently doing at the moment.


So in all honesty, I would really like spending the rest of my life doing either one of these things. I took this gap year so I could hopefully decide between the two, and my gut is telling me medical school, but I'm not sure if I'm thinking along the lines of ""the grass is always greener on the other side,"" or not, you know? And then there's also the question of what way do I truly want to live my life? Where do I want to end up? How much of my life can I truly dedicate to work? etc.

I really apologize for the wall of text, but TLDR I can see myself doing both for the rest of my life, and I'm kind of having choice paralysis over it. That's why I wanted to weigh my options and figure out whether applying now or giving myself more time to kind of figure myself out would be the best option. I hope this helps, and thanks for the advice you've already given me, I'd appreciate hearing what you think about this since it sounds like you might have been in a sort of similar position"
premed,ffp7zvp,t1_ffp00f6,1580088515.0,"I'm sorry I'm not sure I understand fully what you're trying to say, do you mean if I do apply for this cycle I should do it early? If so, yeah I definitely will. It's part of the reason I'm trying to figure out from now whether I'm going to apply come June or not. The other part is just the typical anxiety from not knowing my future haha"
premed,ffp7rzh,t1_ffp01uy,1580088358.0,"Volunteering is clinical and homeless outreach, and yes actually I do have shadowing experience, I actually had just lumped it into volunteering. 


And yeah, I try not to. Sometimes I do but I think I'm okay for the most part. My journey right now is kinda cool, but there's family stuff (like maybe having to take care of a member in the distant future) that is kind of acting as pressure for me to just get in and get my career started as fast as possible (if this current career isn't panning out)"
premed,ffp7li5,t1_ffp4xw9,1580088232.0,"Yeah, I was just thinking since it takes a year to matriculate into the program, I'm fairly sure I would be recovered by then.

You've got a friend in me bud"
boniver,fb3cbjw,t1_fb1p8s6,1576469339.0,"Wow. It's crazy that you say this, because I'm the same way with Re: Stacks, but almost the opposite (if that makes sense). I found Bon Iver right before I found out my younger brother had cancer, and having to be there for him and the family and go through all of that along with other stuff in my life (graduation, figuring out what I'm going to do with my life, studying for a pretty intense test, etc) I was really depressed, and I don't think I've been the same since. FEFA was the album that got me through it, I'm not kidding when I say that for this whole year until recently all I listened to was FEFA. Except Re: Stacks. I feel like that song, being at the end of the album and hearing the phone at the end, marks the end of that depressive journey for me, and while my brother is thankfully cancer-free since the beginning of the year, I still feel scarred and broken in a way. I feel like I'm finally beginning to get motivation to crawl out of it and become myself, and a big ""shift,"" for me was when I saw BI on this last tour and he played it. Something inside of me kinda clicked, and while it's still taking a while, I'm finally starting to come out of it. I hope to finally listen to it when my mental struggles are much better.

Sorry, I didn't mean to ramble, I just thought it was pretty cool that we have similar ideas about this song"

Sorry if I didn't make that clear, I was asking about being competitive to T20 MD programs so that I could get more insight into what kind of options I've got. It sounds like applying MD/PhD, at the moment anyways, isn't right for me. Maybe if this research position works out, in a year or so, I'll have the right stats.

I'm trying to pursue an opportunity here of doing clinical research part time at a lab, and am weighing my options at waiting another year (took MCAT back in April, which should give me just about another cycle, aka apply 2021, before score expiration becomes an issue), or just apply MD and then apply MD/PhD internally after doing research year M1/M2, like someone suggested in this thread.

JapanTravel,f8zgomk,t3_e30i4i,1574960671.0,"Hi! First take a deep breath :) Japan is one of the easiest places to travel imo, Tokyo especially! You'll be fine not knowing a lick of Japanese; many natives love helping because they like to practice their English, and they're just nice people all around. First place I've ever traveled to where I've consistently had people come up and offer to help me without me even asking! The rail lines might be a bit confusing at first but you get the hang of it very fast. You might wander around for 10 minutes before you ask somebody and they get you on your way. Ordering food is also no sweat, you can just point to things on the menu and worst case scenario bring out a translating app. As far as apps go, I usually download an offline Google maps just in case, and the language pack for Japanese in Google translator. The JR app for train times might be useful, but if you're just staying in Tokyo the whole time you might not need it. Hope this helps!"

Aquarius also isn't pressurized, so other crew members live in saturation for days on end, which is super awesome! Interesting to see if they've collected any data on what happens to the body there.
