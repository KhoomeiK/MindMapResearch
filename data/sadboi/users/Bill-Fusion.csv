NewTubers,ey6a0bq,t1_ey5yl2z,1566850802.0,"I don't hear about many horror channels. As for the 50-200 subs per day, that's great!"
NewTubers,ey69vcu,t1_ey5yt3d,1566850712.0,"I find it weird when I make my normal videos it gets normal views, but if I try to do something like what you did the views are higher than normal."
NewTubers,ey673z5,t1_ey5z7ae,1566848918.0,Oh wow! What type channel do you have?
NewTubers,ey67212,t1_ey626os,1566848885.0,"Yeah not updating any channel is not great but I can understand how people have things to do. As for the vlog channel, it least you got that up and running."
NewTubers,expg2xl,t3_ctzds4,1566489984.0,"1. Even if he is watching them over and over, YouTube would remove those views soon.
2. As for promoting, that's some good work that he is doing.

However, I can't say for sure!"

NewTubers,ew332vn,t3_cmie03,1565062701.0,"My family are toxic people and try to make me feel worst about myself in everyway possible. So, I don't tell these people anything that I do. If I would tell them about my channel, they would think what I do is a joke, like everything else."
MarioMaker,esyzx42,t1_esvo4c4,1562352667.0,Yes!
crashbandicoot,es0za2z,t3_c5cjyt,1561485987.0,I love that theme too!

SmallYTChannel,erlmame,t1_erlkikx,1560991002.0,Gameplay with music playing. Either music from the game or swapped music from YouTube music library.
NewTubers,erk59ss,t3_c25yg1,1560955644.0,Thanks everyone!
SmallYTChannel,eppwtve,t1_epp58qi,1559393917.0,"I have no idea how they label something as reused content. How many videos I used the music, I guess 40+ something videos, which I edited just about all of the videos that used the songs."
SmallYTChannel,epmvx8j,t1_epmr10y,1559318092.0,"Oh, I forgot to add I have 2 channels, Bill Fusion [Old] and (just) Bill Fusion.
I made a new channel because I loss my ability to earn money off my old channel."
SmallYTChannel,epmoiaq,t1_eplxtf1,1559315607.0,"I changed the music in the videos using YouTube's music library to remove those claims, but still I'm having this problem."
SmallYTChannel,epluhg9,t1_epki59b,1559303855.0,I used music from channels that offer copyright free music. It was okay a few years ago to use that stuff but now it's not because of YouTube changing things.
