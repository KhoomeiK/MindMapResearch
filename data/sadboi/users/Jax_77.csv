HiiT is a good idea too. I used to do a lot of that actually. Back when I lost all the weight. Id love to right now but I sprained my ankle really bad a month ago, and its still not entirely better. I can do low impact cardio like stairs or elliptical, but many HiiT moves are not in the cards for me right now. Its REALLY annoying having the motivation and will to do certain moves/exercises, but you just cant because of a stupid injury. I just want it to be better so I can get on with this weight loss journey.
