AskReddit,foystya,t3_ga4gjx,1588178529.0,"I have all kinds of strange ones, especially with my s/o, but this one is pretty mild. I had a dream about chicken bones. There was this plate of chicken and I ate it and all that was left was the bones.  I was in an LDR with my current s/o and I kept thinking about him and if he was okay and wondering if he needed the chicken bones, for like protection or something. In this same dream, unrelated, a spider swung down from the ceiling and bit me. It was poisonous and I felt the pain, like I was dying.

My boyfriend showed up in a doctor's mask and slit my hand open with a razor and the poison infused blood ran out. I woke up, and my boyfriend immediately texted me. He had found a chicken bone cross in his backyard. We thought it was cool but freaky, like a sign. No one he asked knew anything about it.

The day he came here and we finally met I was in a bad accident. I was injured and thinking of calling the whole thing off. I was scared of what could happen. We were coming from totally opposite directions. I had received his text a split second after the accident and headed home to get ready, near to vomiting from the pain. When I walked up to meet him at the chosen spot, in a place completely unfamiliar to him, I looked down and the ground I was following was LITTERED with a trail of chicken bones that lead me to that spot. Lol, it was like the weirdest hand of fate had touched us both, as he was coming from the opposite direction and super excited because what HE saw on his way towards me was a poster for a play related to my s/n (not THIS one, lol) that had never played in my town before. It was bizarre, but cool."

Broach this topic very gently and maybe look up an article or two about death grip retraining if it IS, in fact, an issue (it could easily go along with porn addiction); it can definitely make it harder to get and maintain an erection.

Other than that, maybe suggest a little novelty. Toys? Maybe if you get a tenga egg or something (not TOO expensive) you can help him get himSELF off, and maybe he'll feel more inclined to get YOU off as well. If none of these things are an issue, you need to lay it on the line and tell him that a sex life is important to you and that he's the one you want and need to share it with, if you two are going to stay together. 

With a baby on the way, THAT could be an issue, too. Maybe he's having trouble wrapping his brain around the changes your lives and your body are going through.

The other posters are absolutely right. You're very young and a little naive right now (and that's NORMAL at your age) and he's weaponizing that and using that against you, making it ""your fault"" for being so desirable to him.

His aggressiveness is super concerning. Coercion itself is a form of sexual assault; it's no wonder that you're feeling less desire for him. You might want to consider looking into therapy or maybe just finding a more experienced and sympathetic friend to talk to when this is all over. I also advise that you don't end things alone and unprotected. Have a friend or family member close at hand on standby. You may think he'd never abuse or hurt you, but he already is and you don't even know it. BREAK things off. Make it clear that you do not feel your boundaries are being respected, and that you feel like your generosity isn't being reciprocated, and the next time you are in a relationship, set VERY clear guidelines. You are allowed to SAY NO, at any time, for ANY reason, or for no reason at all, and if your next partner doesn't respect that, either, keep reestablishing your boundaries until you find someone who DOES.


I've been in your shoes. I say that not to piggyback off of your advice, but to let you know that it's not okay and it can be very damaging to your level of trust and security.

If you experience a sudden trigger and dissociate, or rage, or cry, if you feel like you're just having a bad day, tell them one thing. If you're having a wonderful date and the conversation turns emotional, express one thing that's bothering you. That's how it started for me.... I told him just one thing. It wasn't anything big for me, it was about my stalker who followed me back to the house where I was babysitting and let themselves in and what happened/almost happened.

 Later, when we trusted each other more, I filled in some of the blanks around that. It's like a coloring book; you fill in the images you want to, and you can always come back to the others later. If you really trust your partner, if you're really friends first and they respect you and your space, give them that little bit...and give them a chance to respond to it. It's okay if there are long periods where you don't/can't delve so emotionally deep. Don't ever feel compelled to give up more than you are ready to...there is plenty of time to do so.

Soooo it started as a blind double-date. We met through a friend who was annoyed about answering questions about each other, to each other, who outright GAVE this dude my number without even asking if it was okay, knowing I'm extremely cautious due to...... well, everything. 

But we talked on the phone for a week or two beforehand,and he seemed cool, and chill. It would be me and him, and his friend and his friend's girlfriend. 

Day comes, we meet up, two guys show, and no other girl. His friend says she had to cancel. I'm put off by this, but like, sure, whatever. 

Turned out she didn't show BECAUSE she was so terrified of my date. He threatened to murder her and her family and blow up her dad's workplace and all kinds of lovely stuff. Wish I had known all that beforehand. 

Anyway, he spent the whole night talking about how much he hated her and how every woman (without the special exception of ME, who was stupid enough to date this dude)  is a whore, slut, bitch, cunt, it just goes on. He talked on and on about how to make bombs and the guns he loves and how badly he'd like to blow her head off with one and basically spent the night divided between OBSESSIVELY flirting with me and plotting this ex girl's death (except they'd had one date with him, JUST like me). 

Right away he asked me how long he'd have to wait for sex, and what he needed to do to get it, and if I'm one of those stupid whores who think a guy needs to WORK for it, etc, but it was obvious I wasn't, because-considering what I was wearing, I obviously knew ""how important sex is to men"". (First time wearing clothes that did NOT fit the way I thought they would; I was too busty in the chest to keep it laced up and I wanted to DIE..... figuratively speaking.) This went on and on through billiards, and dinner, and everything. There was a point when he touched my leg and I FLINCHED so bad.

After the date, I let him know there wouldn't be another. He threatened me, threatened to kill himself, and luckily he didn't know how to find me or even my last name, because he started threatening to kill me, too. 

......DESPITE all that, while claiming I broke his heart, and bitch-guilting me and threatening my life, turned out he was hitting on the friend who gave him my number in the FIRST fucking place. Told her that I'd broke it off, and he was okay with it, because she's been the only girl for him, anyway, ever since they were kids. 

All while still threatening my life and family and crying over me. What a fucking ASSHOLE."
