I’m often regarded as “transphobic” because of various views and opinions I express. (I must add that none of them I personally believe to be transphobic) . However there is no science to date that suggest a trans person that has undergone complete transition, HRT, and testing with testosterone levels consistent with their desired gender has any measurable advantage in said sport. Often it is found they have disadvantages due to the inherent health side effects of said treatment and procedure.
