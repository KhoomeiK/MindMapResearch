I have had other things happen. As a teen if anyone that‚Äôs been to our house for a number of times, going to the bathroom they wouldn‚Äôt be able to turn the door knob to get out unless they said please.  The doorknob was old fashioned no lock.  It terrified some people so much they wouldn‚Äôt go to the bathroom alone. We would say it‚Äôs just George. I found it so funny. 

About ten years ago I had my first migraine. I rescue and had a few parrots at the time.  They kept screeching and I couldn‚Äôt get them to stop. So I said out loud if there is someone here can you please make the birds stop. With a minute I had total silence. I said thank you. A friend said she would have run out of the house lol 

Random people would come for taxes or notary and say what a beautiful calico cat we had. My dad always said to just say thank you.  We didn‚Äôt have a calico cat and he didn‚Äôt want to scare people away.

Guests often saw cats playing in my house. Cats we didn‚Äôt have. 

The most recent is when I was sick with MRSA. I had two rounds of antibiotics and a cream. My mom had passed years before. I saw her across the room. I asked if I was going to die. She laughed and said I was going to be fine. So instead of calling my doctor to tell her I wasn‚Äôt feeling any better I waited it out and felt better in a few days.  Yeah I trusted my ghost mom. She was right. 

Those are just a couple experiences that makes me feel sure of an afterlife. I remember how vibrant my mom looked and I felt like I wanted to go with her. But here I am. But I know we have something to look forward to!"

I have a loaded gun but took my time getting up. My Rottweiler and pit bull were handling it. The criminal never got in. They chipped away some of the wood by the lock on the outside but that‚Äôs all. I could also smell a strong odor of dog jerky treats. I made a police report. I guess the criminal brought treats to bribe my dogs.  My dogs do not like strangers and won‚Äôt take food or treats from them.  Nothing ever came if it. I don‚Äôt understand why they would pick my house. I have nothing of any value. I am disabled with very little of anything.

However they do not like other humans around him. They really don‚Äôt like to share. He loves people when the others aren‚Äôt around. All of mine are fixed.

We have so many forms of birth control getting pregnant unless you want to, shouldn‚Äôt be an issue. Adoption is the best option. I will never understand any woman screaming for the right to kill her baby. The majority of abortions aren‚Äôt due to the baby suffering something horrible and painful. But yet that‚Äôs what everyone tries to bring up in defense of abortion. When it comes to rape the man should be the one in prison but often it‚Äôs the baby given the death sentence.  Before anyone says it‚Äôs not a baby a zygote has everything she needs to become a functioning human. Besides, a happy pregnant woman doesn‚Äôt announce she having a fetus, she announces she‚Äôs having a baby.  If you are dead when your heart stops why aren‚Äôt we alive when it starts beating. Those poor souls, who knows how they would have impacted the world or simply the lives of a loving adoptive family."
pharmacy,etb4dp2,t1_etb1ope,1562636733.0,I can concede to that because I had to stop Celebrex and contact the company because it made me high. They interviewed me and sent me paperwork because they said it was most likely an interaction with some of my other medication. It worked for my arthritis but after a few days I started feeling weird and then a friend laughed at me and said I was high. It scared me because I live alone and responsible for special needs dogs.  I can‚Äôt be compromised.  I was told it was a rare reaction. I put the rest of the pills in a bottle of old soda and threw it away.  I haven‚Äôt heard of Gabapentin having that affect. But if Celebrex can cause that reaction I am sure anything can. I have never heard of it with Gabapentin and grateful it doesn‚Äôt alter me. Junkies will start snorting sawdust at some point. So sick of them.
pharmacy,etb2ke9,t1_etb07fk,1562635399.0,"People insinuated I was some drug abuser in the first responses. Then someone attacked me about my rescue work. Others that I am not telling the whole truth.  Not all pharmacists there is one at my pharmacy I think is wonderful.  This particular one not so much. There was very few professional responses and questions.  Which reflects the attitude of the pharmacist in question. I have gone to this pharmacy for over 20 years and never had a problem. First time I do I get treated like some junky and made to suffer needlessly. That isn‚Äôt right and shouldn‚Äôt be allowed.  I would have submitted to any blood, urine and lie detector tests. I knew how bad the nerve pain was going to be without the medication. And I was right. Even though I got my medicine today it was a bad painful day.  You are supposed to taper not just abruptly stop for 3 days twice a day. And I haven‚Äôt done anything wrong to deserve it. I don‚Äôt understand why so much effort is being put towards junkies but good people have to suffer.  They get free medicine for ODing but others pay for insulin, chemo,epipens,etc those are life saving medication too. But everyone focuses on junkies who not only ruin their lives but others who are being hurt because of their behavior. People they don‚Äôt even know like what happened to me. I don‚Äôt get it."
