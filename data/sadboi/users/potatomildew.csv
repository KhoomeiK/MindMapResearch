Paranoia,fqhortn,t1_fqe1c1t,1589381355.0,"after making sure everything is locked, curtains are shut, and room is cleared I usually just watch youtube at low volume."
mentalhealth,fqb3ybc,t3_ghrmqw,1589230165.0,"I was feeling guilty about not wanting it to end, but it’s nice knowing I’m not the only one. I feel relaxed. A lot more things being done at home, where I’m more comfortable. It has helped my social anxiety. I can go at my own pace and not have a workup of going somewhere else. I love spending more time with friends and my boyfriend (roommates). It has been such a nice little reset. Most of us have a new motivation to get shit done in the house since there isn’t so much of a work and life toll."
socialanxiety,fqb2hiy,t3_ghpyrt,1589229429.0,"I feel like it helps and makes it worse? I get nervous than I’m judged because I know there are people making fun of mask wearers, but at the same time almost everyone else is wearing them and I get to be more covered."
BingeEatingDisorder,fq5aedv,t3_ggpsg9,1589097973.0,"I do, it’s hard dealing with judgment for it so basically stopped. Any other hobby works. Just too bad depression takes over and leaves eating as an only enjoyment."
NoStupidQuestions,fq5ab40,t1_fq5a1nz,1589097881.0,"they usually just ask in my yearly physical, like when they ask the smoking questions and stuff. It’s not after certain answers and has been asked from childhood to adulthood so it’s not really that specific."
socialanxiety,fowrtbd,t1_fov31a9,1588125786.0,"this is what I do when I get the calmness to do it, this is just different because these people will argue with you and try to keep the stuff on there."
socialanxiety,fowroxn,t1_fov2wm8,1588125715.0,I don’t know if they’re really medical staff? I think it’s a separate thing. I’ve called my dr and that was decent because I knew theyd basically walk through it all. The people that deal with the bills are rude and will argue with you about it and do nothing in the end
socialanxiety,foukrxk,t1_fouc1ge,1588085868.0,"If exposure therapy worked for me I’d be extremely outgoing. [This](https://www.goodtherapy.org/blog/exposure-therapy-for-anxiety-backfires-in-study-1108123) explains it best. Pushing is worse, and I grew up *constantly* doing social stuff like clubs, councils, orchestra, youth group. Always pushing. Even more when my “shyness” started to come out. I have to be relaxed state of mind and not think of calling to do it, just can’t get there."
mentalhealth,fop48jw,t1_fomyeq8,1587952730.0,"I did, they sent me to a psychiatrist. She said it was nothing. I am moving to a bigger area so hopefully I’ll be able to find someone decent."
BingeEatingDisorder,fn1ngkk,t1_fn0qkoc,1586565804.0,"Thanks, trying not to. It seems like everything spirals when something goes bad. But for once it’s a bad day for a good couple weeks. Hoping to stay that way and tomorrow is good again."

selfharm,fmzz58o,t1_fmzbdu3,1586532431.0,"I find it so draining that it makes things worse. Sure it helps some people, but stop pushing it. When I can’t get myself to it makes me feel even more guilty."
mentalhealth,fmscvmh,t3_fx2qdr,1586352733.0,"It has been bad for TONS of people. Including well managing, even for people who don’t usually deal with it. I only have 2 friends, but I know they’ve been both doing pretty bad."
selfharm,fmidq8u,t3_fvdodn,1586107547.0,"Probably bring it up, especially if it’s someone you’re interested in. Every bf has known beforehand. It’s not as awkward bringing up when you’re close to the person. For hookups it’s difficult. Still better to bring it up. I honestly haven’t. I forgot about my healing cuts my first hookup. He touched them and I was the one who freaked out and he just reassured me... the other one just kind of kept rubbing the scars. It makes me confused on how to feel. I’ve never had a negative reaction, but you’re right about triggering. It was to my ex, so if it is it’s hard to avoid."
mentalhealth,fmic7bb,t3_fv1pzs,1586106670.0,"This is so fucked. IMO weight should never be commented on. If you’re worried about the health of your child or someone you love encourage healthy eating and exercise. Do it with them. Sometimes a therapist will help. They usually know why their eating habits are the way they are. 

When I was in my early teens I developed quickly. 5’4, still 120lbs, but with DD breasts. They made me look bigger and I went from underweight to average. My family felt the need to comment on it, and that short time fucked me up. I started fasting and restricting, inevitably binging, over and over and over again. The binging started taking over, so I started purging. I see no end, my weight goes from high average to high overweight. It’s awful on my body. I can’t stop because at this point if I’m not starving I’m binging so it’s more maintaining except when things get bad."
selfharm,fmcmgns,t1_fmc6q24,1585948506.0,"I’ve never been allowed anything like it since they found out when I was 12/13, wasn’t even allowed razors to shave for awhile."
selfharm,fmclopr,t1_fmcgp89,1585948074.0,"I wrecked my entire room looking for it, no idea wtf happened to it. If someone found it they would have said something or I’d be at the psych center. There are a lot of notes in it too. I really need to stop putting stuff up..."
selfharm,fmbqgwo,t3_fu812f,1585931333.0,"I always do... I put them in hiding spots so no one else finds them, but just lose them. Right now I’m missing a container with all of my blades and pills I stg it’s just gone."
selfharm,fmaqu3x,t3_ftpa5z,1585904169.0,I honestly don’t even see it as a bad thing anymore (for myself). It’s just so relaxing.
offmychest,fm8gbz2,t1_fm83qje,1585848890.0,thank you. I’m sure it will get better when I leave...
teenagers,fluzy91,t1_flu7ify,1585513521.0,people think anything personal is karma whoring. I agree that it’d go better on a sub more geared towards that stuff though. They’re probably just more comfortable here.
teenagers,flt4n3e,t1_flsnvwu,1585459115.0,"You’re not a doctor either. You can’t say it’s just sad, just like someone can’t say they’re definitely depressed without a diagnosis. It’s common. Some people have it pretty mild. Some don’t. You can’t really say you’re depressed with suicidal thoughts or attempts either. There are other things that cause it. I don’t get this complex. It seems more personal than anything."
teenagers,flt3d6g,t1_fls0lf2,1585458017.0,"They don’t know, because they aren’t in anyone else’s shoes. No one really knows. Shits complicated. Even faking it is a cry for attention/help in itself. Not something to shame for. Just help everyone. No one will help if you don’t speak up. People post this shit ab faking depression every week."
depression,fl28p3j,t1_fl24k5m,1584745430.0,"you’re probably right, I get especially overwhelmed with the front room and it’s just a collection of stuff. I did end up getting (most of) the dishes done, and the pet laundry. It still feels like nothing idk. I don’t think I’ll be satisfied until I see improvement. I don’t really have nice cleaning stuff but candles might help."
depression,fl1wnfh,t1_fl1wihn,1584737851.0,But I feel so... guilty? disappointed in myself? because I am awful at using time wisely.
selfharm,fkzrjyx,t3_flhskj,1584678301.0,"SH in general? No idea, but I started cutting at 11. 9 years going strong."
AskReddit,fkiji59,t3_fikjbd,1584221484.0,"Not sure if this counts, but one time I took over a gram (over 40, around 55) of benadryl. I ended up falling in and out of sleep. It started with petting cats that weren’t there. At one point I was light sleeping and dreamed that my brother had hung himself in the basement. I woke up hearing his dad screaming and telling us not to come down. I could barely walk from the OD, but I went downstairs and my mom was crying and my stepdad was in the kitchen freaking out (the basement door is in the kitchen) Everything was frantic. It felt REAL. I know people usually only take 10-15 benadryl to fuck around, but yeah. Never again.

edit: just to clarify, it was not a thought out thing. I didn’t even know what would happen. It was more of my head saying let’s do this and see if I die."
selfharm,fj6b8f2,t3_fboffw,1583065666.0,"I hate seeing people being judgmental about it. Whether you’re sad, depressed, suicidal, lonely. Anyone needs support. Anyone deserves validation. A diagnosis isn’t needed to know. It’s weird that people try to act like they’re better (or worse) because they’re diagnosed. Talk to someone, but when you’re ready. I’ve been diagnosed continuously for 7 years. It’s honestly one of the easier things. It can be just the family doctor at first and therapy and stuff later."
selfharm,fiwhwk9,t3_fa3xfe,1582786608.0,"It seems like it’s for the best. I’m really glad that your parents are being supportive. Hopefully it will help. I know it’s embarrassing and there’s a lot going through your head, but i’m the long run it will be better. 

My brother is actually the one who caught my more recent too, but he just asked if I got attacked by a bear aha."
piercing,fisq2ig,t1_fism55x,1582690323.0,"Because I didn’t know...  my piercer (yes, technically reputable, but I live in a very small area so that’s just who everyone goes to) didn’t have it on the care instructions and I didn’t bother looking up anything until it seemed odd that it’s still sore and started getting concerned. I’ve been using a syringe with very warm water and cupping in the shower to soak it."
selfharm,fg2tad4,t1_fg208of,1580454975.0,It wasn’t in a toolbox or a dusty box. It was a small cardboard box in my room with packaged vinyl samples and paint cards. No dust anywhere inside or outside. Was only there a couple months. Unused protected blade too. It’s fine. I swear.

socialanxiety,fg0s8kp,t3_ew4b5l,1580414003.0,"In my experience, no medication has ever helped. 3 years of trying different ones. It’s one of those things that you actually need a therapist for if it’s severe."
socialanxiety,fg0s0fs,t3_ew5r5h,1580413876.0,"For social anxiety, it doesn’t seem like that. My brothers and I all have varying degrees of SA. I think it can stem from just not being socialized well. Moved a lot. Never saw kids our age."
mentalhealth,ffyvxfc,t1_ffyuo78,1580356486.0,"Yes, that’s what she’s trying to do. I told them about my hallucinations when I was going, mild stuff like shadows and people and animals but I knew they weren’t actually there and they didn’t scare me. Nothing was done about them and they basically go ignored. I don’t think I really need to go because this stuff might be real... It feels real. I’m really being watched. They make my heart stop. I can’t say anything about it because they won’t believe that they could possibly be real. I stopped going because they only wanted to focus on my depression and general anxiety and that’s the least that I care about, especially with how much it costs to go. Hospitalization leaves me too vulnerable. Who knows what they’ll actually be doing to me... I’m probably not going to kill myself or anyone else. Someone else wants to get to me. I’ll probably just move."
