EcosiaTools

TLDR: I've made a chrome extension that adds calculator, graph plotter, unit converter and currency converter to ecosia.

chrome store:  [https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ecosiacalculator/cplekodcpkjdmdcinciacpkhnjldhoji](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ecosiacalculator/cplekodcpkjdmdcinciacpkhnjldhoji)

&amp;#x200B;

Hello everyone, a while back I asked everyone which features you would like to see added to ecosia. I got a lot of good suggestions and have been working on a chrome extension  for the past month. Unfortunately I wasn't able to incorporate all the features because I'm not good enough with javascript yet and there are, for example, no free translator that even comes close to google translate. Anyway the extension contains a unit converter, a currency converter, a graph plotter and a calculator. I might add more things in the future, this is just a VERY early prototype so expect bugs! Also if you find a bug or a missing feature, just tell me, most of the time its just that i haven't seen the bug before or thought about the feature. My friend told me she wanted to be able to write 5x5 as multiplication instead of just 5\*5, and it took a minute to fix.

&amp;#x200B;

The Extension is called EcosiaCalculator and can be found in the chrome store.
