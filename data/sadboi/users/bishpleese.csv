Our lab practical exam grade will be determined by the few quizzes we were able to take in class. We should be refunded the lab fees at least.
AskAcademia,fljvk9l,t3_fp90z7,1585227751.0,"I think everyone is being expected to do more than they were previously. To take an in person course and convert it to an online one in a matter of a week or two weeks (in the case of my school) is an impossible task. Most online teachers have months to prepare the syllabus, recorded lectures and learn how to teach from a distance. For colleges there are a lot of resources, canvas, blackboard, licensed Zoom etc. My mother is a highschool ESL teacher and she's expected to flip her class online in a matter of a week with maybe a quarter of the resources and technological understanding. Luckily, her kids are grown and are good with technology lol. 

I think and know your feelings are valid, it sucks seeing others do less than you and sacrificing for them. As a parent I know they appreciate it. Educators, that are also parents are dealing with having to flip their classroom and trying to be there for their children, who are also experiencing great change and uncertainty. I know they feel as if they are failing in both areas. 

I think we need to cut everyone slack, this is unprecedented and there is so much uncertainty and not everything will go smoothly, and to expect it to it is unfair to both students and educators.

I'm just an non-traditional undergrad student with three kids suddenly home with the same schedule of coursework. Two of my classes were labs (biochemistry and ecology) and I'm pissed that I won't get to have the same education that I paid for because of this pandemic. I'm also angry at myself and the situation because my oldest is scared and lonely without school and that I can't be there for her because I have so much to do, all the time. 

Everything just sucks right now and it's okay to be upset or angry. But don't take it out on other people, communicate your feelings and let people know what you can do and cannot do. You may have to suck up some but don't take on too much that it makes you bitter toward your colleagues."

As for moving your things, think about what you definitely need, if you're staying in dorms or a furnished apartment then mostly you need clothes and your school supplies laptop etc. Bring the school stuff you like (notebooks or pens etc) that you probably won't be able to get there, and then plan on buying everything else there.
