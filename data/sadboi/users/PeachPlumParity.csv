A lot of F2P characters (such as the original Euden and 3 star characters and a few welfares) got their mana circles uncapped to 70 instead of 50, breathing new life into the meta.  

Instead of having to do the core 5 star weapons, now you can craft Chimeratech weapons from the void battles in order to get weapons that are able to do endgame content. These void battles only require 12,000 might or so and are extremely simple and easy.  

There is a new mode called Agito Uprising that is much easier than the high dragon trials that also gives you six star weapons for crafting, and you only need the aforementioned Chimeratech weapons for them."

If your symptoms respond to treatment you would probably say that your BP Disorder is in remission or that treatment is working.  Even if you still qualify for cyclothemia you'd have to treat the symptoms as if you have bipolar disorder. The only reason I can think of that your bipolar diagnosis would be rescinded is because the manic episode was the result of something else, like stimulants or a brain tumor.

It's important to remember that it's a disorder -- that is, it's a name for a collection of symptoms. It's not going to tell you what the actual cause of the disorder is necessarily."

gachagaming,fk5m4or,t1_fk5kr7j,1583883332.0,"Arknights is extremely stamina limited outside of events like the current one where they hand out 100 AP sanity potions everyday, so it can be really easy to spend all your stamina doing just 5-6 stages on auto.   
  
FGO by comparison tends to hand out more AP refillers but since there is no autoplay it really depends on how long you can keep your sanity doing the same stage over and over the exact same way until you have a nice surplus of materials.  
  
Neither one is all that great for long playtimes IMO but of the two, FGO actually allows you to play longer in general.  
  
If your 1-2 hours per day is split between GBF and also another game, I would choose Arknights as you can do all your dailies with autoplay and therefore play both GBF on PC with browser and use either your phone or emulator for Arknights at the same time to be more time efficient.  
  
FGO's best events (lotteries) are extremely time intensive to get enough rewards to make it so you aren't constantly farming materials.  They can also burn you out really easily because of the lack of autoplay.  
  
Also by now you've missed a couple very good welfare servants in FGO: Shiki Assassin and Rider Kintoki in addition to two different versions of Elizabeth Bathory, Oda Nobunaga, Jalter Santa Lily, and Assassin Scathach."

You can even set it so that they save their Magia (basically a noble phantasma) for the last wave of enemies. Instead of innate skills you have Connects that characters can use after three of their cards have been selected, which allows a different character to attack using one of their cards + they get a buff depending on whose connect it is.

Arknights has a great world but translation errors pop up at odd times and there's few points in the story where character development really happens (hopefully that'll change as more chapters get released).

gachagaming,fj4rku4,t1_fj4q607,1583015205.0,"Arknights can be a good sidegame since its best played in small bursts because of stamina restrictions. Story is decent, really nice art, can auto stages after 3-starring them. Has a light base-building aspect if you're into that, and Tower Defense is pretty unique gameplay. Give it a try -- I didn't think I'd like it but it's now one of my fav recent releases.

If you're into Puella Magi Madoka Magica and/or Magical Girls in general, Magia Record is really nice for AFK farming. Think FGO with more QoL features like auto-ing stages you've already done, less material farming b/c no individual skills to level, an actual pity rate (though still not the best gacha), and ability to switch targets/AoE without ultimates.  

  

EDIT:  I forgot to mention but these aren't auto-repeat, just normal auto stage after beginning it. If you do want Auto-Repeat, Dragalia Lost is really good for that but stamina is pretty limited without stocking up items from log-ins and events. Has auto-repeat up to 99 times, and also skip tickets (6 per day and you can stockpile up to 200). You can also overfill your stamina with items up to 999 Stamina/99 Co-op. Really nice to save up stamina and then just leave it on auto-repeat while you cook dinner or something."
