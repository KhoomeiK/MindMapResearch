This probably not what you were trying to convey, but the way the fully formed head has been placed on the body really tells me the message of being put in a situation you didnt want, isnt you, and didnt ask for.

declutter,fqc39y6,t1_fqc29fr,1589249222.0,"Those are some very effective techniques and its great you found a system that works for you.

By the way i get the picture of what you are describing now, very interesting. 

As i read the last paragraph i immediately imagined my mother who has started displaying more hoarding tendencies as she gets older. She even buys random shit for us that we dont even need and never expressed any desire for. I had noticed the hoarding had to do with older people but had never really made the connection."
declutter,fqc0qwn,t1_fqc0c4i,1589247745.0,"Fair enough. I'm one of those people that sometimes benefit from people just being pushy when im exhibiting problem behaviour. Usually this has to be after the first few times ive proven to be obnoxious, not straight off the bat. Kinda what sounds like is happening here, but yeah it does make sense it would piss someone off... but i get pissed off all the time, it's what I actually do that matters.

Interesting about those particular traits of hoarders especially with touching and moving of stuff. I made the assumption because they had so much a d typically so much it has no way of being organised, that they wouldn't notice.

Yes i had slightly pack rat tendencies from my mother but through my routine spring cleans i manage to find garbage bags of clothes or other items to give away or throw out.. i have no idea how i have so much. Minimalist life feels so much better for my soul."

Its also on the ground next to the planter beds as well. It's everywhere. I obviously cant weed spray my planter beds because i want to keep the squash that is growing... is there anything i could do to prevent and stop this nettle infestation or is it just the old fashioned pull them out?

I'm concerned that the nettle roots will interfere too much with my plants that i actually want to grow in there."

Straight up speech actually being used as passive aggression by people who aren't honest with themselves about their feelings. 

I like to take those sayings and use them as their literal meaning, especially because people tend to take them badly, its a good gauge for me to see how honest they are with themselves, and how honest they think I am being with them, and if I need to adjust my communication style accordingly. People have such a fear of being misunderstood.

As i said i do agree with you, but also good to use that ""so you're saying that im saying xxxx, which would mean xxxx"" right back on them, and remember you're in charge of your feelings and it doesn't matter if not everyone understands you."

Volumeeating,fp3cnch,t1_fp23pik,1588276992.0,"Hah so glad to be with you in the love of Kale there. Stuff is amazing! Look there are a couple ways i do it, both pretty simple, just one has more calories than the other. I'll start with the more calorie dense one first. 

Put some butter in a hot pan, melt it until it just becomes a little brown. Splash some lemon juice in there to stop the butter burning any further (this will spit at you so be careful). This is called nut brown butter/buerre noisette. Pop your kale into that now, it will also spit at you. Sautee it and put a lid on to essentially steam itself in those juices, add salt or pepper. Cook to your liking, just make sure you keep shaking and stirring the pan. Done.

The less calorific way - more ideal for volume eating: Heat a pan, spray pan with a lil oil spray and put Kale in. Squirt lemon juice over kale and add a small splash of water - this will probably spit as well. Cover with a lid, cook to your liking and shake/stir frequently.  Salt and pepper. Done.

I hope you like it as much as I do, I'm a big fan of using Kale to volume eat as it doesn't wilt very much and has a nice thick leaf which requires extra chew time. Enjoy!"
