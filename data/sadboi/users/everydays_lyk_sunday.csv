I'd initially felt bad bc I thought that I wasn't cutting deep enough. I thought that the relief wasn't enough. Then I saw how many I'd done and all the scars and realised that I'd done a lot. I felt better but worse cos there were loads (I know it's wrong but the quantity balanced out the lack of 'quality' in my cuts, if that makes sense). 
I was watching a video on this which calmed me down and put what I do to myself into perspective. It really made me think about this and how self harm can be a paradox and make me want to keep trying harder to hurt myself more even though the initial act is enough.

I wouldn't force you to raise your voice

But I ask you to consider

If only for a moment 

The possibility of asking somebody, anybody
For assistance - Without resistance




You have a way with words

You can share them with a doctor

Or a friend or here on a screen

I wish you one day feel serene

And the tears that fall from your arms and eyes

Can be but a memory




You've inspired me to rhyme

I hope that you will take the time

To lend a hand to your own pain

And fight on so your bandages can be replaced by a smile

I know not of your struggles, but please don't let me ask in vein




Keep writing my friend,

Replace a blade with a pen

The next time the urge arises 

Don't forget its a war you're fighting

With your own mind,

But please, to yourself, be kind.

You can start tonight?

Good night."

If she is trying to stop, take her to her appointments, talk about the process and any progress she's making. If she's resistant/addicted, talk to her about why it's important that she seeks help for the SH (and other mental health issues that may be happening at the same time). Ensure she's onboard and ready to commit before the appointments otherwise they'll feel like a chore and may get frustrated enough to think about self-harming again. Be open and honest with her about your feelings, and encourage her to respond in kind with you and the professionals (even if she relapses). You're probably doing this already, but maybe make it clear/frank/clarified/blunt so she can know that she doesn't have to cope alone may help her.

Learn the reasons she self harms. Some people do it to dissociate from distress, others do so to pull themselves away from the dissociation. Finding out which category she falls into may help her to figure out her triggers and formulate any appropriate distraction techniques/alternative (recreational, perhaps) activities that might be able to help her resist.
 
But overall you've done the best things you can so far by getting her some help and pledging to be there for her. It is natural that you'd be cross at her for harming herself as you are her mother who cares, and your apology shows that. She's lucky to have you.
