sadcringe,fr4c46o,t1_fr4b465,1589883334.0,"There is a niche group of individuals on the internet called furries who dress up and pretend to be animals.

Some of them do it just for fun and put on their costumes (fur suits) for the occasional convention. Others wear their fursuits and act as animals on a much more frequent basis.

Some actually believe themselves to be animals and embrace the animal persona all the time. (There is another non-“Furry” name for this but I forget what it’s called).

Furries get a lot of flack from the rest of the internet because they’re perceived as being very sexualized, which most people find weird. The fursuits are also usually anthropomorphized versions of animals with large cartoon-looking eyes and faces.

There is (of course) furry porn that is like anime porn where there are disproportionately large breasts and throbbing penises, except instead of humans, anthropomorphized animals are depicted.

So this guy appears to be of the group of people who want to embrace their animal persona full-time, and he chose his father’s funeral as the time to introduce himself (assuming this isn’t satire)."

I think that by the time he became a teenager and started becoming obsessed with mass shootings and had developed the strong disdain for society as whole, he was already lost. There isn’t really anything you could’ve told him in the few years before the shooting that would’ve stopped him from eventually doing something like that.

And he shouldn’t have had such easy access to so many weapons. His mom had to be at least somewhat aware of his violent tendencies and should have prohibited guns in their home. People who write books about casually murdering others at age 10 should not have access to deadly weapons.

Landing fees alone at some of the biggest airports in the US are around $1,000, so it can get pretty pricey.

It can cost upwards of a million dollars or more a year to operate a private plane, depending on the size and how frequently you fly. I used to work in private aviation and one of our owners probably spends $2 million a year on his plane. He spends more than $100,000 a year on catering for the plane alone. But he flies it twice a week and uses it for business so it’s worth the investment, I guess.
