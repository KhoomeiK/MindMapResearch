Look at all the OTHER times this has worked, which is zero.

And no, an old dog can't learn new tricks. As much as you want to believe it, this doesn't happen. You are using mysticism to explain away the nuclear bomb.

Stop taking in all of that nonsense and start looking at how people REALLY deal with their mental health. Listen to what they do, even the successful ones. Go find podcasts that talk specifically about these things and listen to what they do.

You'll find that even the most successful people who have overcome the odds know they can't escape their depression, anxiety, or addictions. They can set themselves up for success for the day, but that doesn't mean tomorrow won't derail them."

You are right, an old dog can't learn new tricks. When it tastes blood, it will never get that taste out of its mind. When you have dopamine and all sorts of chemicals involved, the dog won't hunt. Not anymore.

And in your world, if these people beat their addictions, then why can they never return to what got them there in the first place? It is because they are aware of the temptation to go back to their lives.

You're coming at this the wrong way. As I said in my original reply, you are trying apply a success filled thought against the torrent of the storm that is mental health. Sometimes you just have to ride it out and know it is a part of you. 

Once an addict, always an addict. It isn't that you can't break the addiction, it means you cannot put yourself into the tempting situation again. As you get older, it gets harder to change. Your comfort is in the familiar.

You can alter how you see life, but you have a strong possibility you will never fully escape depression. You can avoid being in situations that trigger it, you can avoid the things that remind you of your past, but you will never fully say ""I am healed Lord, take me away.""

depression,fr69dhl,t1_fr68kep,1589922206.0,"Actually, I face the realities of this world. Depression happens to everyone. Some depression is easy to get out, others aren't. The idea isn't to beat it because you are making your ""shadow self"" stronger by doing so. You are making it a competition on who can brain harder and better.

Meanwhile, if you accept that you are depressed, you are addicted, you are anxious, you can deal with that reality. You can deal with the fact it might not go away at all, and in fact rarely goes away because of the way the human brain is constructed and how habits are formed. Even when you change habits, the survival mechanisms kick in. This is why you often see relapses and people dying to drug habits they kicked multiple times.

In all honesty, listening does help. Doing nothing and being still helps. It beats the alternative of beating someone over the head with the ""You're Broken"" stick hoping it will get better.

My friend, you should talk to therapists about their craft. Let them tell you what they do and learn what is most important. You will see there are no magic pills and no ways to get over depression. Not all of it, not completely. It is like being in a haunted house. You can anoint it with holy oils and water all you'd like, but sometimes the ghosts come back.

And this is coming from someone who has talked to therapists about what they value and listened to how they process it. You may not like my style, but I am not here for you. I rebuked you for your open-ended feel-good self-help attempt at being better.

AskReddit,fnjohft,t3_g24zqr,1587003351.0,"Simple. It shows them that I did watch it and I wasn't drawn into what they had to say. Often I will follow up with a comment regarding it, but it is part of the feedback system. Many times people don't expect to get any negative feedback whatsoever. That is not how life works, sadly. 

I've watched a few news videos that took the wrong message away from what the news piece had to offer. I wouldn't let it slide by saying they did a great job. Just the opposite. They are trying to enforce a narrative that doesn't exist.

It is a part of being creative. You don't have to pay attention to the dislikes or the comments, but they exist for a reason and you might be better because of it *(you in the collective you, not you as in the OP).*"

It often ends up going against them because they don't take into account that life doesn't act that way, but it is an interesting journey to get there.
