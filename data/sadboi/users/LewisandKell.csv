Friday was a shock. I don't think I've ever cried so much in my life. Felt like 4 yrs of work went down the drain. I feel like I would have been less surprised to hear that my aging parents had caught coronavirus and passed away.

I hid away from all my friends and went to stay with my parents. I couldn't bear to watch the celebration when I was personally so devastated. I'm not looking forward to the next few years, knowing that this residency program was one of the last places I'd want to end up.

One of the worst part is not knowing what you could have done differently. I wonder if I'm on the spectrum, if I came off as an arrogant prick during the interviews, if I talked too loud, to soft, or what. Was my nervousness seen as unpreparedness? I don't know.

Anyways your SO is lucky to have you by his side. He's going to need all the support he gets."
