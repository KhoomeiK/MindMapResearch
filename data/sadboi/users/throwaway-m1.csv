fuckeatingdisorders,fbfkb7l,t3_ecw83k,1576812679.0,"part of the reason you are eating so much of lower calorie foods is because you are not allowing yourself to have PBJs and other higher-calorie health food. Personally - once I started eating high-calorie food, it was 10x easier to become satiated and full. 

It might take some time to get to a place where average sized portions fill you up. problematicbeing nailed it. you need to eat a lot of food right now!!! probably more than a person who is not in recovery. a starving person needs a lot of food."
fuckeatingdisorders,f97ints,t1_f96tmoe,1575166105.0,"it's good that you can recognize that that thought is coming from your disorder.  I definitely get that even though that feeling is due to a disorder, it definitely doesn't make it any less scary. 

I hope you can recognize that you have so much more to live for than your weight. It sounds like a lot of your feelings are rooted from living in a fatphobic world. But the reality beyond society is that you have so much to live for that being anorexic will take away from you. I know it's hard to believe, but it's not worth it. You deserve health."
fuckeatingdisorders,f96swuz,t1_f95ja9s,1575151246.0,"ah, that makes sense. I'm probably not a great example, because I've had periods of time where I wasn't restricting and this is around where my weight landed, I don't know if I lowered my set point, I think this has probably always been my set point.

I can't imagine your body finding a lower set point via anorexia. It slows down your metabolism and fucks with your body in all sorts of ways. 

Obese or not, I honestly think your brain getting stuck on the possibility that you could weigh less and be a skinnier person is part of your disorder. Many of the people I've met with anorexia, typical or atypical, have this same thought process, including me. I often wonder if I had gotten down to an even lower BMI, would I be able to recover at the ""minimum healthy"" weight. 

I'm guessing the answer is most likely no. If you, or I, did get down to a lower weight, there's the risk that your body would even want to gain *more*. Or you could die in the process."
EatingDisorders,f94yl2u,t3_e3layx,1575110634.0,"I know that some people in the comments are saying that it's a bad idea to date when someone's in her situation, but she's an adult and I think if there are no red flags, you're both having a good time, and you're both communicating well, go for it. While sometimes it can be complicated dating while in recovery, I think building a life outside of your eating disorder, including relationships, is super important and healthy. 

I went on a few dates with the same person very early in recovery, and it didn't go anywhere, but we had a ton of fun.

 I met my current partner shortly after I decided to recover from a relapse. Having something going on in my life that doesn't have anything to do with my eating disorder has been so helpful. It reminds me that I am not my eating disorder, being in recovery = the ability to have a relationship. Focusing 1000% on recovery, and not having a life outside of it, personally, makes me extremely miserable and limits my recovery. 

Anyways, I hope this comment might encourage you to not write her off because she's in early recovery. She's a whole person outside of her disorder + recovery."

Also, therapy and potentially anxiety meds or other anxiety treatment/management. You gotta look at the whole picture of wellness, not just your weight! That means physical health, mental health, and environment (if you’re living in a location you hate, at a job you hate, in a relationship you hate, you don’t have any hobbies you love, etc).  And managing all of those things will make managing your weight 100x easier.  

Are there any exercises you might enjoy? Swimming, walking/hiking, yoga, even running around with kids or a dog. Are there healthier foods you enjoy that you can incorporate?

Then they deprive themselves to compensate for the binge, and the cycle repeats. 

Sometimes guilt behind eating (other people’s food) can oddly make the binge urges much worse. I don’t have BED but I’ve had some experiences with this. 

Obviously not okay that she’s exploding and harming others. I am sorry you’ve dealt with harmful behavior from her for so long. Just keep in mind that she might be really struggling at the hands of mental health problems. Maybe next time you bring up her binging, ask if she’s okay and if there’s something going on.

fuckeatingdisorders,f7jfyot,t3_dwagql,1573776791.0,"It seems like some of your ways of thinking around types of food and when you can eat it is pretty disordered and getting in the way. Exercising is awesome if you love it, protein and vegetables and meat are also great for you, especially if you enjoy them. The key (in my experience): you know what is also awesome and really good for you? Eating dessert. Enjoyment of food is pretty important in life and in healing your relationship with food and your body. It's not as bad for you as your brain, or a lot of the world, tells you it is. 

All of those things you listed have nutritional value. Calories in of themselves are nutritional value. You need calories to live just as much as you need protein. Fat and carbs are essentials to your body and it's survival. You are craving them for a biological reason. Lemon desserts can't be your *only* source of nutrition and sustenance, but you know what? They are *a* source of nutrition and sustenance. 

I recently had an experience that sort of blew my mind. A few months into recovery, I got labs done. I had been eating ice cream, and sometimes other desserts, nearly everyday. I had Starbucks, which is in my mind, the worst form of empty calories I can imagine. I exercised minimally. I got dozens of tests, vitamin levels, cholesterol, thyroid levels, hormones, etc... And they where all the best they had been in my entire life. So where my weight and blood pressure.

On top of that, you deserve a normal and healthy relationship with food emotionally. Wanting dessert is incredibly normal. Enjoying food is a fun thing in life. It makes your life better overall. It's a way to bond with people, have nice experiences, and take care of yourself and others."

Don't focus on losing weight, focus on how you are feeling physically and emotionally, and with a healthy lifestyle you might lose weight without focusing on the number. Avoid all of the diet culture weight loss stuff that can be incredibly triggering.

It might be a good idea to stop calorie counting. Some people find it helpful to have a calorie minimum, but that has to be a minimum and not a maximum, and it should probably be more like 2,000 calories or so. 

I have a meal plan from a dietitian, but I’ve also found it helpful to look at food instagrams (not extreme or disordered or fitness ones) and watch what other people are eating to see what normal people eat. 

You can also set yourself a really basic meal plan, maybe something like what mine is - 3 meals a day, 1 entree and 2-3 sides, including a protein and at least 1 other food group. I know that understanding what you need to eat is confusing, but I’ve found meals are actually pretty simple if you understand you just need to have an entree and sides!

The good news is, if you truly commit to recovery and eat unrestrictedly without compensating, you will not gain unnecessary weight. Your body will stop gaining when it is fully healed.

Sure, your health problems might stick around even if you gain weight, but they will definitely stick around and likely worsen if you don't, and you are not giving yourself a fighting chance if you stay this weight or lose.

I was around the same BMI, a little higher, the same resting vs standing heart rate + low blood pressure symptom, and my ED started around age 11-12, and I'm 18. My health issues haven't fully disappeared with weight gain, but they got better. At a low weight, you are slowly getting sicker and sicker every day.

Food tasting good is what made recovery happen for me. There are sooo many reasons why it is worth it in the long run, but day to day, meal to meal: the good news in recovery is that you can have any and as much as delicious food as you want, and food is your medicine!

I hope she comes around soon - maybe try spending some time with her and completely avoid the topic of food and eating?

Trans/nonbinary people rant online because a lot of people are really cruel about misgendering, and I mean, *really* cruel. Sometimes I get upset at innocent people because I'm so fed up. So if someone gets upset this is normally why. 

Examples: Someone misgenders me, I say ""I'm a guy"", they roll their eyes/or say ""*okayyyy*....."" or look at me with a questioning look. I'm in the men's restroom. Someone (probably drunk) shakes the door of my stall and screams ""IS THERE A W O M A N IN HERE??? IS THERE A WOMAN IN HERE???"". One dude followed me out of the bathroom and spent a good 30 seconds staring at my genitals and chest with a questioning look. So if someone nice misgenders me after something like that happens, I try to be polite, but I might be a little pissed."

EDAnonymous,eyv9w2q,t1_eyps0rk,1567485524.0,Sounds like regular old anorexia to me - it's possible for your anorexia to fluctuate in severity and go through phases where it isn't that bad. I don't think that would exclude you from an anorexia diagnosis.
EDAnonymous,eyv9fcu,t3_cxzsp3,1567485043.0,"Honestly this might be a sign that you need to gain weight and you aren't fully weight restored.

fuckeatingdisorders,eyv1vd1,t3_cyym7l,1567478204.0,"I don't think it would be wrong to wear a binder if it makes you feel more aligned with the way your body looks. But it's a temporary solution, and binding can be somewhat dangerous if you do it on a regular basis. Wearing a binder everyday will eventually damage your back, shoulders, or ribs, and makes it harder to breathe. You can't safely do it longterm. If it is too small on you it is extra extra dangerous (and this could be a problem with weight fluctuations)"
bulimia,eyv1d5z,t3_cywwty,1567477796.0,"Sort of depends on 1. your other behaviors 2. how your body reacts (like some people with eating disorders will lose more weight than others while eating and exercising the same amounts. It seems to be related to genetics and metabolism)

I'm guessing most of the people who lose a bunch of weight lean more to anorexia binge/purge subtype and restrict a lot. You will still retain some of the calories you purge (I don't know how many). I lost quite a bit of weight quickly when I started purging, but I was also restricting like crazy."
