psychoanalysis,fr12sgz,t1_fqxr9pd,1589812141.0,"I'd suggest getting into some light Liang, Foucault maybe. Just keep exploring. Each branch of psychology has something to offer. Even the cruel bits. Eclectic is the word of the century."
psychoanalysis,fqxp9vw,t1_fqxnybz,1589735814.0,"Why shouldn't you make yourself out to be important? Those are important observations to make, especially given that you've explored the field independently so far.
You are important, and your critical presence is too, (as long as it is constructive/awards basic respect to the other side etc). 
I am hoping that no one individual gets power enough to have that kind of effect. As long as you're open to criticism yourself, and don't otherize the ""mentally ill"" then you'll be okay. Keep yourself from forming a saviours complex if you can, go for therapy yourself if you can, keep interaction open with all subfields and crossfields of psychology, consistently work on the shadow, inner fascist self. Psychology is as serious as medicine but with a much wider scope."
psychoanalysis,fqxls3n,t3_gl9dt4,1589734272.0,"I know what you mean. I've faced a huge amount of disillusionment with the field. All I can say though is that we can use every bit of manpower we can get. In psych research, clinical fields or even in social work. We need people who care enough to critique it and then participate in making it more efficient. What I would've done to have a classmate like you during undergrad. Your fears and concerns are valid, and it's an uphill battle with little return, so individual intrigue is what the subject is surviving on now. Which is you and your dedication to the study of the human experience. Come over to the dark side, we have marshmallows if you wait enough XD"
Codependency,fo9cp1j,t3_g67l50,1587615979.0,"I have felt the same way for a very long time. But there are a few observations I have made along the way that have helped me.  

1. When I care about my own self, when i'm compassionate and patient in my day to day life, even when I over share the emotional intensity doesnt always get overwhelming.
2. Intention of sharing matters, always ask yourself why you want to speak about something. Sometimes we share just so that we can feel the feelings but aren't alone with them. That can be super intense for the other person. 
3. Context is everything. Remaining aloof when everyone is bonding isn't healthy and over divulging difficult narrative when the atmosphere is light can difficult. Even the stage of the relationship you're at matters. How close are you right now, and how close do you want to get and how fast do you want to get there. Every decision is a journey. 
4. Know what you're expecting in return. Do I want to be held/heard? Do I want affirmation, validation or advice? 


Hope you find your way!"
GradSchool,fmqkse7,t3_fwu7x4,1586301566.0,Mental health > everything else. Listen to your needs.
jhu,fmqhpyy,t1_fmq1w60,1586299835.0,Wow I know such professors.(I'm from another continent and a different field). They're not worth it. They build you up by caring about you and then break you down so intimately when they should be guiding you from a neutral space.
getdisciplined,fmgsrtm,t1_fmefrp3,1586056859.0,Oooo thankyou for this
getdisciplined,fmgsowb,t1_fmewgte,1586056799.0,"There's healthy and unhealthy ways of engaging in activities. Excessive masturbation, or masturbating with fantasies that ply on shame and self hatred, all of that gets unhealthy. When it isn't about loving yourself and connecting with your body, but about killing time and whiling away and just consuming material."
BPD,fmdlrfm,t1_fmdlhwz,1585971115.0,How do you do that?
BPD,fmc0r4p,t1_fmbqkao,1585936747.0,"So I've found often that people feel much better in their miseries or traumas when they're able to reach a point where they find the absurdity to be funny. Or a friend with whom they can laugh. 

But I think that requires a leap of faith. An utterance. A belief that you're worthy of taking the leap. I think I get too scared to hear myself. Before experiencing anything, I exclude myself from the group. I insist, in my fear, that I must not belong. That's one part of it. 

I don't trust anyone to laugh with them. I can flirt and please people and make them feel brilliant about themselves but I can't make a person laugh if their life depended on it. I can laugh when others are having a good time. I feel like shit for it but yeah"
BPD,fmbvkqj,t1_fmbsk00,1585934016.0,I think I relate more to the second part. Too unsafe to be funny. And then in that space are people who use humour to establish power/dominance. Which just shuts me off completely.
Codependency,fahj7ju,t3_e99f4a,1576086895.0,Healing's begun! Congratulations on taking the first step
BPD,fah1fqm,t1_fah0zv1,1576076923.0,"That is a wonderful answer. I know what I need to do honestly, just wait it out until I am earning myself. I do find it difficult to stay true to that. I need to wait. Be patient. The feelings often sort themselves out. I hope. I believe."
BPD,fa6g6t7,t1_fa699q6,1575824361.0,Hmmm I don't know what to do about it though

mentalhealth,f9501m8,t3_e3ozkk,1575113063.0,"Honestly, whatever is up with him, he doesn't deserve to be your FP. I know a lot of people in the BPD community are able to retain healthy relations with their fp but this dude isn't going to be able to do that. Let him seek help at his own pace but please be committed to your own recovery first. You deserve better.."
mentalhealth,f94zr31,t3_e3u9xf,1575112579.0,Therapy. Honestly I don't know where I would be without it.

BPD,f8jjein,t3_e0xe9s,1574601168.0,"I'm glad you recognised it and spoke about it here, sitting with a feeling is very hard to do. I can't do it much without my therapist."
BPD,f87fkgy,t3_dxn8f3,1574330965.0,"Sooo, I was thinking birthing trauma (c section or other complications) could be a thing but then I realised that then there wouldn't be such a gender disbalance in how the condition manifests no? Or do you think different gender socialisation changes manifestation of the trauma wounds?"
BPD,f81no0a,t1_f81nel1,1574172886.0,Oh. Okay. That sounds difficult but it's a fair realisation.
BPD,f81lsml,t1_f81j3r8,1574171401.0,"Okay, distance and observation got it."
BPD,f81kfi6,t1_f81hwze,1574170250.0,How do I believe they're committed to it?
BPD,f81c68l,t1_f81c3nk,1574161227.0,I really needed to hear that I think. I've been trying for a week and I will keep trying forever. Because this really can't be it. It all feels funny then
lacan,f80cb2n,t1_f7wyr4u,1574125596.0,Where can you find this podcast?
BPD,f7s9p6s,t1_f7s68om,1573992479.0,That actually makes sense.

Huh... BPD part of your brain, that's a look way to look at it."

mentalhealth,f72aag0,t3_du5dr1,1573356931.0,Why do you do that
mentalhealth,f6ybc89,t3_dtmqje,1573273526.0,"Happy birthday friend!!! You're not alone. Please make an animal friend, humans are difficult sometimes."
mentalhealth,f6h9bg2,t3_dr39yu,1572840261.0,"You're doing wonderful, it is a part of our struggles that we're unable to ask for help. I know people who want to reach out but don't their entire lives. The fact that you were able to change a pattern that had been in place for almost a decade, means that you had been somewhat working on yourself for years to have been able to ask now. You'll learn the ways to balance and prioritize your work and your self. I know the current societal structure isn't such that they give mental health leaves the same way as physical illness, and they don't understand it as much,but it is just as essential for you to prioritize yourself when others won't and set an example for those around you. I reached out four years ago, and today six friends around me have signed up for therapy too. 

Don't cloud a good thing in a negative perspective, it won't help you. Be patient with yourself and don't set such unreasonable standards please, you deserve better."
mentalhealth,f5k3g0n,t1_f5k2flf,1572253783.0,"I like the idea of thinking of it as my mind making conspiracy theories. I think that's really going to help me, thank you."
Codependency,f5k0p8r,t1_f5ixf6a,1572250574.0,"Hi, can you share the names of the podcasts please?"
mentalhealth,f3tdkr7,t1_f3tcn0y,1571129188.0,"Hmmm, that seems fair. I should stock up in a space I can access, if not the kitchen. I live with my parents, and they control what is bought. They'll get me anything I need but it usually follows with comments about me looking sickly or pride for me doing better but I don't want that from them. It's just a thing, I don't like comments on it and they know and they don't respect that ever. Their comments about this are one of the most frequent stressors. 

The problem of not being able to eat or swallow when stressed still remains, even when there is food I like, right in front of me."
