People online and friends irl told me that my behavior and way of thinking is not normal. I read a lot and informed myself about some mental illnesses and I only say I might have something when I'm saying anything about it. For example I'm numb all day for years and tried commiting suicide 3 times. I also show many other symptoms of depression, so I think something like this is an obvious illness. I understand your hatred for self diagnosed people since a friend of mine self diagnosed and has never shown any symptoms of that mental illness. What bugs me the most is he counts waiting near a train and not going there as a suicide attempt. I tried to electrocute myself and have heart problems because of it and it's making me angry that people don't take mental illness seriously. Im happy that there are other people thinking the same as me. Wish you the best!"

Not everybody is able to get treatment and get diagnosed, but I know what you mean. I hate people who say they have ocd because they're clean or people who say they have depression because they were sad for 2 days. If someone has actual symptoms of a mental illness, he still should be taken seriously without a diagnosis, but people who fake it should get a punishment"
