EatingDisorders,foh376g,t3_g6yfbl,1587760010.0,"this does not make you selfish at all. i completely understand that it may feel like you're bringing him/others down w you, but it's always so much more helpful to talk about your struggles than to keep them bottled up. Relapse is a normal part of recovery, and you should work hard on not letting it deter you from the end goal. You deserve more than the guilt and the difficulties that come with the eating disorder, but to get better, you're going to have to accept yourself flaws and all. yes, you struggle, and yes, you need to talk. let yourself be vulnerable and truthful about your struggles. the people you love are in your life for a reason, and that is to be there in the good AND bad. it's important to go through the hardships together with full transparency, as your relationship will grow stronger as you help each other through your difficulties. don't blame yourself and be kind to yourself, and remember you are worth being loved and cared for. <3"
EatingDisorders,foh1s6y,t3_g77udt,1587759545.0,"from my stance, i'm not proud to admit that i just don't eat during times like this... i think it has to do w both the physical discomfort of eating when i don't have an appetite as well as the knowledge that i'm, in a way, in control? but i urge you to maybe eat something light and something that won't trigger guilt, (fruit, veggies?) try to minimize the guilt you feel when you find yourself unable to properly take care of yourself, it's a larger and scarier pit when that happens. be kind to yourself and take small steps to overcome both the depression and eating disorder. you're not in this alone. you got this! you only get one body and one chance, cherish yourself and take care of yourself. <3"
