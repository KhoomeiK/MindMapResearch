AmItheAsshole,fqoazne,t3_gjudzy,1589511265.0,I wonder though the things that lead up to this? Info? Did you ever give your half sister a chance or have you always shunned her? In this situation you’re NTA but I would feel sorry for your sister if you never gave her a chance in the first place and I’d understand why she’d feel resentful of you.

NPC development? yes fucking please!!!!! I hope this means we can decide who they marry and how many kids they have. And evolvement inside and out of your household I hope means at the very least they fix the family tree (2nd cousins and so forth) and sort out the incest issue.
