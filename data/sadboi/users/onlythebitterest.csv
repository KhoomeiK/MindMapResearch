And esp regarding reproductive education , some states just don't teach it, not even as part of a science course i.e. this is a uterus, this is a penis, this is how women give birth."

unpopularopinion,fp0otvb,t1_fp0gnhc,1588213668.0,"Feminism is defo not sexism against men. It gets a bad rep because of these super hostile so-called 'feminists' who hate men and bash them, but in reality Feminism is just about equality. Some people would come back and argue that no, that's egalitarianism. No it's not. Think of it in this scenario... 3 people are near a fence and want to look over it. Person A is tall enough to do so without any help, Person B needs a little help to look over the fence, and Person C needs a lot of help. An egalitarian would give each person a box, regardless of whether they need it or not, and call their job done. A feminist, however, would give person C two boxes to stand on, person B one box, and person A none, because he doesn't need them. Of course, this is an over-simplification, but the basic idea fits. Feminism is about helping people who, through no fault of their own, face barriers that society has created for them. While this description doesn't necessarily include men in the workforce, it does include men in other aspects of life, like for example, assault. Because sometimes men do not get taken seriously when they say they've been assaulted (sexually or otherwise) by a woman, and that is a bias that needs to change.

As for the statement on religion, I pretty much agree. And if somebody chooses to believe in something, it should be private and up to them."
AskWomen,fonyn57,t3_g8d3f2,1587929057.0,"I had been bullied a lot in highschool and never got much attention from boys because of that. I had hoped that uni would be different and I would get more attention from the opposite sex, but apart from clubbing, I didn't seem to get much attention from the opposite sex. Then one of my friends had a birthday party, I got super trashed because I had just lost a student election and there was my current boyfriend. The first time we met I apparently made fun of him for not knowing how to spell a name (which I don't remember cuz I was plastered) and then later that night we found each other again and it got very hot and heavy. I was scared to bring him home so I ended up hiding behind my friends door, where he saw me and left me alone. The next day he found me on Facebook and messaged me. We had our first date a week later. It's been over a year now and I've never been happier. He's the most supportive, loving, kind, gentle man I've ever met, and I love him to bits."
EatingDisorders,fo80j65,t1_fo7zzq0,1587587746.0,"Yea that's true, it all gets so confusing in my head because I want to be skinnier but to be skinnier I have to eat less, workout more, but then for normal people that's fine and they can just do that without de one guessing everything you do cuz what if it's my eating disorder telling me to do these things... But then am I never gonna loose weight? And then one thing leads to another and all of a sudden I find myself back in the cycle of binging and restricting that I worked hard to get out of."
EatingDisorders,fo3wn1w,t1_fo2hlm7,1587494194.0,Yea I feel that... He just metabolises stuff really fast I guess so he can eat soooo much but if I so much look at what he's eating I feel like I've already gained a couple of pounds. Then that makes me feel bad and I'm like ugh I wanna eat stupid amounts of food too and then that's baaad.
EatingDisorders,fo3w9t3,t1_fo2st1u,1587494012.0,"I have brought some stuff up with him, but it always makes me feel bad because I don't know what the solution to it is, and then I feel like I'm bringing it up just to be negative.

EatingDisorders,fo25l3v,t3_g59ymb,1587450440.0,"I do understand, it was a similar thing for me... I thought if I just ate less I'd be skinnier. That led to me eating less sure, but then eating huge amounts every so often and then binging more and more and then feeling guilty and eating less and etc etc. But I felt like I knew what was happening, I knew what I was doing, and I still did it.

AmItheAsshole,fnym2ju,t3_g4e6jj,1587367403.0,"NTA at all. I'm so sorry about your experience OP. I know all too well how it feels to have someone who you loved and trusted gaslight you. It was insane to read your post because I felt like I was reading my own life. I realised eventually that moving out was for the best once I got out of that toxic situation, even if it didn't feel good to start with. Hell, I've lost more friends this year than I have in over 5 years! But that's okay, because then you really know who is worth your time. If you ever wanna talk, I'm here. TBH I could use someone to talk to who has a similar experience."

unpopularopinion,fn01f4q,t1_fmzit0q,1586533676.0,"Forget about teenagers, I'm in my 20's and this is still a thing!

Girls get weirdly jealous of things they don't even want. I got a new boyfriend and would tell my (ex) best friend all about it, expecting her to at least be happy for me. The responses I got were usually as follows:

Me: He's soooo cute!

Her: Meh, he's perfectly average, he's just cute to YOU.

Me: He has such a cute hint of an accent!

Her: Ewww *people from that accents place* and that accent are THE WORST.

Me: He's so outgoing and charming.

Her: He's really awkward.

^that last one was apparently the hill she chose to die on as she decided that it was appropriate to conduct a social experiment about it over brunch with us, as I wanted her to get to know my new BF better. I was so confused and once I understood what had happened I was really upset and didn't want to talk to her. She then made out like SHE was the victim because I wouldn't talk to her and yelled at me on public transport about it.

She also has various mental health issues that I think she uses as an excuse for her shitty behaviours, like a lot of people do, and insists that ""she doesn't like people poking fun at her mental health thank you very much"" even if the person means well. 

She then maintained she had no issues with my boyfriend for months, and I found out that behind my back she was asking my roommates to lie that they could hear us having sex despite the fact they couldn't, and bitching about me and him. I thought I'd left that kind of shit behind in high school but apparently not. That was the last straw for me and I have tried very hard to not talk to her since. In any case, she doesn't belong in my life anymore.

I think she was just jealous that I had something new and good in my life, and that she didn't have a love like that. It's not like my boyfriend was her type anyways. Me and my SO just celebrated one year together and are happier than ever... So SUCK IT BITCH."
heartbreak,fmxnfb5,t3_fxle0p,1586468259.0,"The worst is when you're truly worried about them, because you know they have someone toxic in their lives, who is the reason you are no longer in theirs. The hurt that comes with knowing that they could so easily cut you off after everything,  when you've done nothing but your best. But they can keep a piece of shit in their lives just to let them walk all over them whenever they feel like it. The hurt I feel from knowing that is nothing like I've ever felt before, because I can just be cast aside over something truly petty, while someone who is a narcissistic, manipulative bitch who has actively hurt them before can remain in their lives. It makes me so angry, so hurt."

TrueOffMyChest,fm5640u,t1_fm549bc,1585767018.0,"You clearly don't understand the concept of a society. If we were in a state of anarchy then maybe your reasoning would make sense. 

Do you also disagree with laws that criminalize murder/rape/etc. 

Also the US does have really good hospitals, there's no denying that, but their healthcare system is absolutely fucked. What's the point of having good hospitals if nobody can use them without going into stupid amounts of debt for something as universal as childbirth (even middle class families struggle with this so this is not a poor man's problem). Also the US has one of the highest maternal mortality rates in the western world, which is once again, insane.

I fundamentally disagree with your statement that laws are violence, I do not want to kill you just because you don't want to be a contributing member of society. I pity you but not much more.

Also taxation isn't theft, it's basically like a subscription to the service that is society. Since you exist within this society, you have to pay the subscription to use the facilities in this society. Now you may think, hey I don't use any facilities so I shouldn't pay taxes... Uh yes you do, something as simple as using roads means you are a member of this society and take part in societal interactions. 

If your above statement is truly what you think then you really want to live in an anarchic society where you'll be fighting off every other person because laws don't exist to protect you or your property and everything is a free-for-all. If that sounds like your cup of tea, well then, I think you're clinically insane.

Toodle-pip."
TrueOffMyChest,fm5322w,t1_fm51esw,1585765421.0,"Lmao so you think having a large homeless population makes your city/state whatever a better place? Nobody is stealing from you, that's literally what taxes are for. A country takes taxes to invest into various projects: housing, education, healthcare, etc. To make sure that it is looking after its citizens to the best of it's ability, because that is the role of the state, or is supposed to be the role of the state (which the mighty US of A seems to sideline because they're incompetent assholes). 

What do you think then of systemic oppression and people caught in cycles of poverty because of the lack of support they receive? (The idea that the poor get poorer and the rich get richer?) The very idea that someone would have to go into debt to receive a decent university-level education is abhorrent to me. The idea that the US, as supposedly one of the leading countries of the world, has such a poor healthcare and education system, is so odd. There are no other developed countries in the world that are so backwards that the don't EVEN provide a liveable minimum wage....

P.s. nothing I said in my previous comment was remotely violent you inbred fuck"
TrueOffMyChest,fm50vza,t1_fm4nzho,1585764261.0,"The Universal Declaration of Human Rights literally states a right to housing your moron... 
Laws are created to protect the rights of the vulnerable, because the vulnerable cannot protect them on their own. They're supposed to create a baseline for people's lives so that they're not taken advantage of. Now, however, this has changed to laws that protect the rich while fucking over the poor and vulnerable."
TrueOffMyChest,fm4wh4f,t1_fm3y25z,1585762067.0,"The most ridiculous thing is people even having to go INTO debt to receive a decent education in their own country... What are your taxes for if not bettering the lives of the citizens? Ohhh right... Billions of dollars in military funding just so you can stick your nose in other countries business when nobody asked you to... If you guys redirected even a fraction of that spending into healthcare or education y'all would be so much better off than you are... America is quite literally the laughingstock of the world. America is the bully in the playground that nobody likes and grows up to be a full, stupid, adult that doesn't know anything about real life and just wants what it wants, fuck the consequences."
