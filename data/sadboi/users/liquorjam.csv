kpophelp,fql8tlr,t3_gjgsa5,1589450316.0,"2NE1: my first kpop group and also my first exposure to korean media in general, it was around 2010/11 and i cant remember exactly how i found them but im pretty sure i saw one of their music videos on the youtube home page and decided to click it. i was hooked instantly! loved them from the get go and never stopped. having 4 strong girls to look up to as a kid really changed the way i see myself and other women in a positive way i think, so i will always be grateful to them. i miss them dearly every single day, blackjack forever!!

BTS: ive known about them since debut pretty much, two of my friends were kpop obsessed when we were 13, they were more into exo but did like bts too but i didnt really get it since i was a girl group stan lol. i remember thinking ”rap monster is such an embarrassing name” lol and that was kinda it. when they started REALLY blowing up in the west (2017/18) i was in another fandom but i noticed a few of my friends had hopped on the wave and were trying to convert me back into kpop, i caved eventually and watched a few of their mvs. was instantly drawn to j-hope and never looked back after that. i dont have as big of an interest for bts as a whole nowadays but j-hope is my ult of ults forever, i love him dearly and probably wont ever stop.

i stan a lot of other groups too but i tend to fluctuate between biases/group positioning on my list of favorites but these two are always at the top. after i got into bts i got into got7, nct, monsta x, seventeen, super junior, stray kids etc and while i see seventeen as one of my ult groups at the moment i havent been a fan for too long so i cant really say if they’re going to have that status for me forever. all i know is that kpop enriched my life a lot and im happy to be here and to be a fan, even though i immersed myself fully a little later than most."

suggestions: nct daily youtube channel, nct life show, hot&young seoul trip youtube series, once you’ve familiarized yourself a little more with the members i suggest the nct 2018 weekly idol episode (even tho doni and coni are cunts), wayv have a pretty good amount of content as far as i can tell but im not sure where to find everything with eng subs as i am admittedly not as into them as the rest

edit: would like to add that taehyung vaping wasn’t even that big of a deal, it was mostly armys bickering amongst themselves and it blew over in mere hours/a day tops, he isn’t responsible for how other people feel about him holding a vape in a single photo and definitely doesn’t need to put out a statement for something so minor."

kpophelp,fppgqrv,t3_geppyy,1588801970.0,"oof, very hard to pinpoint a specific lyric but generally jhope and suga are very, VERY good lyricists but in different ways. jhope has been recognized and praised a lot by fan translators for his use of words and how they can be interpreted in many different ways which makes it hard to translate, a good example is his mic drop verse (even tho i wouldn’t say it’s his best, my personal favorite is ”all the unnies call me beepbeep” in cypher pt 3 for comedic reasons)

yoongi is generally good at telling stories and painting a vivid picture imo. he would be a good book writer. my favorite song of his is ”the last”, it holds a tremendous amount of meaning for me as it’s so raw and outspoken, interesting and poetic (not romanticizing the theme of the song but more so how it is executed)"

edit: something that’s been on my mind lately is park jimin in paris. there was a bit of a scandal there because of the video that leaked but it was buried VERY fast by fans, and probably by bighit as well. he is still one of the most popular idols in the world which is surprising."

rant,fplu3u9,t1_fplssuk,1588719501.0,"i understand the annoyance, bts has the biggest fanbase in the entire world so there’s always someone lurking somewhere lol, here i am. i would suggest all the cyphers (just search bts cypher on whatever streaming service you prefer) as well as the song agust d and the mixtape. the actual song isn’t on the mixtape but just search it on youtube and the music video is there with subtitles! the agust d mixtape is on every streaming platform and there’s english lyrics easily accessible on google. the song ”the last” is my personal favorite. bts was actually supposed to be a hip hop focused group so a lot of their earlier work (2013-15) is pretty rap heavy but also pretty cringey because they were so young lol.

i will admit their latest album map of the soul 7 wasn’t my favorite of theirs, but the rap songs are golden. i suggest intro: persona, interlude: shadow (+1 on this one), respect and ugh! from this album. RM has released two mixtapes that are both very good, the last one was released in 2018 titled mono but it’s a bit more mellow than his usual style, i still recommend checking it out though. the third rapper j-hope has his own mixtape as well titled hope world, he has a VERY unique style, much different from either of the other two which i think could be an interesting listen for a hiphop fan!

got7: second group i got into, catchy songs and funny members, generally easy to be a fan of and its to your advantage to know jackson in the future lol

nct: third group i got into, takes a while to learn all the members but if you divide by unit its a lot easier! suggest watching weekly idol with nct 2018 since all confirmed 18 members are in it (excluding yangyang hendery xiaojun from wayv but thats another conversation lol), fun upbeat songs and funny members!!

exo: you have probably already heard of them, kings of kpop basically, fairly easy to learn all current members, good music, they dont have as much content as other groups do but starting with their knowing bros episodes and exos ladder is good!

seventeen: another big group, just like nct it takes a while to learn all members but they have a lot of content out there so you learn their personalities as you learn their names, you can find all of their shows and appearances with english subs on like17subs, suggest watching going seventeen on youtube as well! known for their stellar performances and for being self producing

monsta x: just like got7, pretty easy to sink your teeth in! funny members, catchy songs, does a lot of american promo so theres tons of funny interviews to watch as well as variety show appearances

these are good groups to start with i think! once you’ve familiarized yourself to more groups and how kpop operates in general its going to be easier to get into older groups as well"

i don’t know much about winner tbh but i love how you described mino! i’ve only dabbled in their music but i think i’m gonna give them more of a chance, although i am sad i didn’t get to see the group in it’s entirety before enlistment.

i love baekhyun! i posted a few days ago about getting into exo and i genuinely regret not doing it earlier. i remember watching exo showtime back in 2013 with two friends who were absolutely obsessed with them, but me being a girl group stan (2ne1 anyone? lol) i didn’t get the hype so i avoided them for years until now pretty much. i knew baekhyun briefly thanks to my old friends but i really got to know him in superm and thought he was super cool! i didn’t think he was the mood maker/entertainer of exo but i was definitely pleasantly surprised when i got to know him more. he deserves all the praise in the world for his vocals and overall skills, and i really see him as a pro idol!"
kpopthoughts,fpg65pm,t1_fpg29dq,1588595345.0,"i love this! always happy to see someone who ults him appreciate him as much as i do. my slogan is ”jhope appreciation day is everyday” lol. and i 100% agree with the good person part, he really is amazing at keeping his image up and that’s something i admire in idols. don’t get me wrong, i understand idols are humans too and they will make mistakes/cause controversy even if they dont mean it, but i feel like jhope is a good example of an idol who presents himself in the best way possible. i can imagine trainees and hoobaes look at him as a role model in that aspect as well!"
kpopthoughts,fpg0q4l,t3_gd4ytk,1588590536.0,"im not an once or blink so i can’t say how either fandom feels about it but either way it’s gonna be exciting! both groups usually have banger title tracks so i’m excited to see concepts and where they are heading, blackpink more so. when it comes to sales/streaming it’s gonna be a tough call but both groups are going to do great. bp is at an advantage since this comeback has been long anticipated though."
kpopthoughts,fpfw08i,t3_gd8c2z,1588585619.0,see this is a good method but unfortunately i am a hoarder of kpop boys. once i see one i like its locked in my head forever and no matter how much i want to i cant let them out of there. its a blessing and a curse
kpophelp,fpfuwl2,t3_gd69ne,1588584420.0,"i think when they debut they play it up more and as the years go by they absorb some of that identity. ”fake it til you make it” kind of thing, you get used to acting/thinking one way and eventually you’re going to act/think like that without noticing

a good example: jhope is the funny/noisy one in bts, he’s said a few times that he does sound effects without anyone else even being there or without reason to and shocking himself when he does, it’s just a matter of getting used to acting one way and so it just happens lol"
kpopthoughts,fpetaa1,t1_fpet70c,1588554465.0,hahahahah its a simple mistake!!! i would’ve thought that too if i wasn’t aware of the show
kpopthoughts,fpernj4,t3_gcyncs,1588553484.0,"well, they do a good job because they have to. their idols are an investment, if one members image is tarnished it reflects on the entire group which in turn reflects on the company which leads to stock prices dropping basically. some idols get away quite easily with slip ups while others have to live with their stuff for their entire career, if they even have a career after its been exposed"
kpopthoughts,fpeqpwj,t1_fpeq4am,1588552919.0,im pretty sure they’re talking about the tv show and not the idol group haha
kpopthoughts,fpe8c9z,t3_gcwrav,1588542378.0,this was a good quiz! i feel like this particular subject needs to be talked about more amongst this community
kpopthoughts,fpbly1r,t1_fpblqx8,1588473081.0,"absolutely, most of them (from what we’ve been able to see) would be quite easy coverups in the case he regrets them but they would have to be big and dark. the hand is a no go though, the purple heart has already faded to a very ugly saturated color so im gonna guess he’s gonna fill them up soon"
kpopthoughts,fpbagbi,t3_gcgah7,1588465600.0,"i love suju so much and i wish newer kpop fans would look into them more, they arent called the kings of variety for no reason!! also their music slaps"
kpopthoughts,fpba9bc,t3_gcbk7c,1588465478.0,"i definitely see what you mean, its not too far fetched to think cl drew inspiration from nicki and that yg wanted her to have that image especially since nicki started popping off during 2ne1’s early days. her music nowadays and overall how she presents herself is much different though imo"
kpopthoughts,fpb4jcb,t3_gc9qmp,1588461954.0,"i dont like his tattoos either, i wouldnt care as much if armys didnt hype them up everytime we get a single glimpse of his hand or arm though. as someone who grew up in a tattoo studio and who has a ton of tattoos themselves, what irks me the most is people saying they want to see his ”sleeve”. he doesnt have a sleeve. its not even a scattered sleeve. (this is armys fault not jks lol i respect him and love him he can get as many ugly tattoos as he wants)

edit: i also have shitty tattoos, i have too many handmade stick and pokes to count but i also have some very nice and delicate ones, i am aware some of my tattoos are ugly but since i have so many and im not a global celebrity it doesnt really matter to anyone lol"

kpoprants,fpaxlb1,t3_gceto9,1588457813.0,"i mean... if anyone wants to get to know him outside of ships, isnt an individual live kind of the perfect opportunity for that? i didnt watch the live but i have a hard time believing he spent the entire thing just talking about mark. i personally think he has a very likable and enjoyable personality outside of ships and honestly fail to see how him being part of two big ships is justification for people only caring about him when he’s in a pair"

kpopthoughts,fp7mlrs,t3_gbplnp,1588373497.0,i would c r y if we got another knowing bros ep i need yoochul in my life again BUT i can also understand why they dont do variety (doni and coni go fuck yourselves)
kpopthoughts,fp73skv,t3_gbm0ii,1588363528.0,"i feel like it depends, my ult is jhope and i call him that most of the time bc its a cute name and he loves it but i also call him hobi or hoseok or seokie (a lot of nicknames for one guy lol), but i know some idols dont like when fans call them by their real name too so its a bit of a grey area? on the other hand, its VERY rare to see someone call wonho ”hoseok”, i get weirded out when they do tbh, and not just bc he shares a name with my ult but because its so rare? it goes both ways too, its weird seeing someone call minghao ”the8” even tho its his stage name"
kpopthoughts,fp738nl,t3_gbjnqk,1588363238.0,"i think after jopping came he got an overwhelming amount of praise and adoration which he also acknowledged, he is such a cutie unproblematic wholesome guy its impossible to not like him"

unpopularkpopopinions,fp63w1o,t3_gb9e0g,1588345588.0,"see i get what you’re saying, trending hashtags and what not isnt always necessary, but i do think people should be allowed to criticize the way bighit does things. if you think one member is being held in the shadows this comeback or whatever it may be then you are 100% free to express that and wish for them to have more spotlight. bighit is after all a money hungry huge company, they are bound to be criticized by the way they run things and that is completely fine."
kpoprants,fp636g2,t3_gbfl1v,1588345197.0,"ah yes, because gatekeeping the fandom and thinking you are superior because you were there when bts were struggling is absolutely the way to go forward. you are allowed to be proud of what you and others achieved during those tough times but the reality is that bts has the biggest fanbase in the entire world, they are bound to be competitive and annoying. you don’t think directioners were constantly fighting eachother over superiority? who was there during xfactor days and who came after midnight memories? the fandom formula is never going to change, this isn’t an army problem but a ”large group of people gathering” problem. stan culture in itself though has changed a lot in 6 years, largely thanks to kpop twitter, because now we have streaming and the numbers consume us whether we like it or not. twitter is bound to be absolutely atrocious because it’s full of angsty teens letting their anger out and picking fights with eachother. relax, don’t interact with people you find annoying and you’re gonna have a much better time as a fan no matter the size of the fandom"
