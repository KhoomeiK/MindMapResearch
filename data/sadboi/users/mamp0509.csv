AskReddit,fitbcx5,t3_f9kd1v,1582713260.0,"I'm not sure if i thought i was actually going to die, i was a kid at the time around 6 or 7 years old. But i could have easily died. 
I was in my grandparents garden, right down at the bottom of their garden they had a pond with some fish in and plants. 
 I found a stick that had come off the tree and would like swirl the water around, pretend its a wand etc. Walking around the outside of the pond. It had like a little brick wall around it so I'd sit on it/walk around it sometimes. 

My older brother, he's only a few years older but he used to be real mean to me as a kid. Well he grabbed one end of the stick and tried yanking it out my hands. I obviously didn't want him to have it so i kept a hold of the other end. After a few seconds he let go of it and i fell backward. Into the pond. 
I guess he just ran away because the last thing i remember was being upside down, fish swimming past my face and then it was just darkness. Blacked out. 

Next thing i know I'm in the house, in my older sisters arms surrounded by everybody, my parents and paramedics. My brother didn't tell anybody what happened and they went to look for me, all they saw were my welly boots floating in the pond. I very well could have drowned that day, lord knows how long i was in the water for."
