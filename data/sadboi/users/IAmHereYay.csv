Anxiety,fq4sup8,t3_ggnxc7,1589083363.0,"I haven't used this before and I think it could be really helpful.  I personally use the ""I'm afraid, so I'll do it scarred"", but I use the phrase ""I can't"" more than I use ""I'm afraid"".  I think using this could help me get a lot of things done, thanks."
