Your law school has its own agenda, and it'll try its damnedest to cajole you to going where it wants you to go (usually BigLawâ„¢).

I always advise students to do whatever they can to preserve who they were before law school. Self care, friends, family, sustaining old hobbies, whatever it takes. Don't let law school change who you are fundamentally as a person.

As for the date setting, you shouldn't use the quickset date (pull the crown 1 click) between 8pm and 4am because during those hours, the date change mechanism is engaged. If you change the date while it's working, you can really damage the watch by shearing the gears that change the date (they're probably plastic, so not super durable).

I also strongly recommend picking up a decent style guide. I like The Elements of Style by Strunk & White. Some of the advice is a little dated, but most of it holds up. I'd also check out The Redbook or Making Your Case, both by Bryan Garner (anything by him is generally going to help). I think you can also find Bryan Garner's writing column on the ABA Journal online.

pics,ewgq7v2,t1_ewggedm,1565387782.0,"Edit to get to the point: I don't think it rises to the level of infringement, but Crocs has to police its trademarks to maintain its rights.

Trademark lawyer here. Parody may be the basis for a fair use defense from a *copyright* infringement claim, but trademark fair use is a little different. You may claim *trademark* fair use only if you're using the trademark nominally (i.e., just referencing the named product, ""Yeah, my uncle bought me a Rolex."") or using the mark descriptively (as in, Apple can't sue you for trademark infringement for referring to the *fruit*). Trademark infringement happens when someone uses the same or a confusingly similar trademark in commerce such that the consuming public would be confused about the source of the product. Namely, would an ordinary consumer think that he was affiliated with Crocs, or that Crocs sponsored or endorsed him? 

The other thing about trademarks is that you *have* to enforce them or else you risk forfeiting your trademark rights. Hence the C&D. If Crocs let this slide for a number of years and then decided to sue, he could argue ""Well, you let me do this for years without saying anything..."" which could potentially be a solid defense. There's no statute of limitations for trademark infringement, so in lieu of a statute of limitations defense, defendants can argue that a claimant sat on their hands for too long.

TL;DR Trademark fair use is a little quirky--Crocs likely had to send a C&D to keep its trademark rights strong."

I think the Tissot V8 and Dan Henry 1964 are nice looking, but I don't know how well they hold up.

I definitely second everyone saying Seiko Samurai, though."

FellowKids,es58mdx,t1_es3jiyg,1561604358.0,"Copyright and trademark lawyer here. 

Copyright infringement? Not likely. Titles, slogans, and short phrases aren't copyright protectable, but they may be protected by trademark provided the owner has been using the phrases in the marketplace to sell a product or service. 

We're definitely closer to trademark infringement, but the standard for infringement is ""likelihood of confusion,"" meaning, would the ordinary consumer--folks like you or me--sincerely misattribute the source of these *dental services* to Disney? No, of course not. That said, the fame of a trademark also weighs heavily in analysis, as does the similarity of the goods and services sold under the mark. I'm sure Disney has sold some GOTG toothbrushes or dental floss *somewhere.* 

There is also a principle of trademark fair use, and it works very differently than copyright fair use, but it isn't applicable here.

They're *probably* fine, but in the legal community, Disney is one of those companies that you just don't fuck with."
LawSchool,erljcee,t3_c2koq7,1560988728.0,"The first year of law school is like being in high school again: long days, lots of homework, and no control over your schedule. It goes get better in subsequent years, but if it's going to take a nasty toll on your mental health, then there's no shame in rethinking it. There are easier ways to earn a living, even if you still want to serve people."
LawSchool,erczdyu,t3_c1g2it,1560726308.0,"It's a learning experience. While you're there to support the firm, ultimately your reason for being there is to get exposure to the practice of law. They selected you for the job because there was something about you that made them feel you were the right fit. 

Work hard and thoughtfully, ask questions, and don't be afraid to ask for help. They'll understand, especially if this is your first legal internship. Good luck with your summer!"

LawSchool,eoh0zli,t3_brrumx,1558570296.0,"I'm sorry you've been left out, and I'm sorry you're lonely. It's tough being in a demanding environment *and* being away from home with no real support network nearby. Unfortunately, you're all grown ups and you can't make them be friends with you if they just aren't into it. It's a big firm, though--try to find a young associate in your practice group who can be a mentor to you. It isn't the same as having peers, and I appreciate that, but it's better to have *some* type of support network than none.

And you didn't fail your internship. It's day 3. You'll make it. No, you didn't ruin your internship by complaining about the assignment. Should you be careful who you say things like that to? Sure. At the same time, though, if one of my interns tattled to me that another intern complained about an assignment, I'd definitely think less of *them*, too. Are you in elementary school? As a supervising attorney, there are things I want my interns to tell me about: did another intern say or do something that was offensive, uncomfortable, harassing, etc.? Something that really made you feel threatened or unsafe? I need to know about that. ""Mary didn't like the assignment"" is a waste of both of our time and I don't want a brown noser.

As everyone else said, pick yourself up, dust yourself off, do a good job, and be cordial with your fellow summer associates. It's early, not everyone knows you yet. Give it time, be personable."
