It should have been handled in-house at the school.

As others have said, I'm not saying what he's doing now is okay and shouldn't be punished, because it should, but you said he seems to have been doing very well lately with you and his overall behavior. It was not his idea but his friend's, who in my opinion likely roped him into it due to their history together, but I would try to find out more details around the situation and evaluate whether or not this friend is an inherently bad person for him to hang around with.

Are you her first? It may be a result of inexperience. Does she experience discomfort in the vagina? Slow sex doesn't sound enjoyable unless she is hypersensitive. Is she hypersensitive? That could be a big reason she can't handle other positions, oral, and anything but slow missionary. She could be in pain from these other things and not telling you. 
Does she orgasm when you have sex? Does she initiate or is it only you? 

In my opinion, this is either a health issue for her or an issue of not being sexually compatible.

sex,fdz9wfs,t1_fdty2tp,1578788087.0,"Hello there abblabb, I noticed that you incorrectly equated marketing toward men as toxic masculinity. The reason Trojan doesn't just call Magnums ""Trojan Large"" is because Trojan is known for it's variety in condoms. Ribbed, bareskin, thin, extra thin, etc etc. The reason they have Magnums as separate is so that girthier men (and other penis owners) can also have access to all of those varieties. I've been with men that can only use the thin variety and if they were well endowed and didn't have the separate Magnum brand, they wouldn't be able to comfortably wear condoms at all.   
You say that the name ""Magnum"" promotes toxic masculinity. Magnum derives from latin, literally translating to ""great."" Now, I'm assuming you equate this as ""oh, they're saying that bigger penises are greater."" That's not true. Great can literally just mean big depending on context, and in the case of condoms that are 15% bigger than the basic of the brand, that is clearly what the name is referring to.  
You quoted an article about a hip-hop contest ad campaign for Magnums. They talk about the ""living large"" lifestyle and what-not. But there is no part of this article where it outlines any sort of negativity toward those who don't have Magnum sized penises. It is literally just a promotional campaign marketed toward African American males that make up 40% of all Magnum purchases. In hip-hop, a common thing that is rapped about is an extravagant lifestyle.   
In the article you quoted, ""people are proud to show they have a Magnum condom — the large size really connotes a sense of ‘above-average prowess,’ let’s call it."" A sense of above average sexual prowess is something that some men could get from purchasing Magnums, but that's not how they're marketed. Magnum doesn't market itself as ""for men with above average sexual prowess by means of a larger penis"" it markets itself as ""for men with above average girth.""

So, no, the condom name ""Magnum"" is not a result of toxic masculinity. It is a result of marketing toward men with above average girth. Trojans are called Trojans because they're making reference to the warriors of Troy (known for being brave, strong, and determined). But do you have a problem with them being called Trojans? It doesn't seem that way from your post. And if you do have a problem, then talk about how the Trojan company is marketing toward toxic masculinity then instead of making a stupid assumption about the name of a bigger condom."

Use ""I feel"" statements, talk about how sex is important to you in a relationship, talk about how you feel unattractive to her... If she really cares then she will seek help for her issues.

Like maybe put more cities, community centers, whatever your alters want for more stuff to do. It is also possible that they haven't divulged other parts of their inner world to you (the architect of my friend's system does this for some reason). My friend has nine dimensions in their system! Only two are able to be accessed, but they have whole cities, towns, forests, etc. It's like a whole universe in there. They have hundreds of alters and it's just not feasible for more than like 10 of them to front regularly, so all the others make lives for themselves in the inner world. 

There's really nothing to be embarrassed about when it comes to your inner world. Everyone who thinks that you're faking simply don't understand what it is to experience such an intense disorder. DID does things with the brain that many neurotypicals simply can't fathom. I myself couldn't fathom it until I knew my friends system for months. Having a whole other dimension in your head? That's so hard for anyone to imagine (I dare say it is nearly impossible) unless they've experienced it them selves. You don't need to put yourselves through more difficulty out of fear of being perceived as fake or ""odd"".

If your trusted individuals understand what DID is, then they should have no issues with learning that your system uses your inner world as a place to live and be comfortable.

If your inner world isn't like this, do you have any alters that can manipulate the world and create spaces for these alters to work on their hobbies?

Do you have a gatekeeper? Those alters usually help a lot with organizing who's fronting and who remembers what. How many you probably need depends on how many are in the system but I'm guessing with 36 you could get by with one or two. 

One of the alters in their system created another alter that is an AI. She doesn't have feelings or hold trauma, she just keeps track of information and a log of who's fronting when. If any of your alters are able to make another alter that serves this function (it might not be something your interested in but just a possibility) then maybe look into it.

relationship_advice,fc1eci0,t1_fc1e136,1577316228.0,"No you can't delete the bad comments just down vote and ignore, ignore these stupid people they are just internet ghost saying whatever they THINK the issue is but only you and your bf can understand the depths of the issue you should have him go to the doctor to check him for OCD and set him up with a therapist this is not normal behavior and goes far past superstition. Only you and your bf know what you need not random idiots on Reddit"
FragileWhiteRedditor,fc10egl,t1_fc0nqme,1577304679.0,"I read your replies what makes it funnier is the dude is a gaming YouTuber who spams his link on every sub Reddit, yeah he is definitely drowning in puss lmao"
relationship_advice,fc0rc8u,t3_efit4d,1577297774.0,"This would have been funny if both of you didn't care for marriage or weren't together that long but the fact you guys have been together for 6 years and often talk about getting marriage makes this a poor joke, you have every right to be upset it wasn't funny and it was way too late in the relationship for him to make this joke he should have known better. It would of been funny if he faked you out and then proposed after, that would be kinda cute but yeah no he's definitely an ass for that."
relationship_advice,fc0o8yz,t3_efh0qq,1577295741.0,"If this affects him enough that it causes issues in his life or gives him actual anxiety it could be OCD or a subtype of OCD like someone down below said. If it doesn't impact his life in a negative way though could just be stupid superstition, however all these people commenting down below are jacksses could be a serious thing that OP BF is experiencing mental issues are a thing you know."
relationship_advice,fc0kopf,t3_efh1pe,1577293122.0,"You guys aren't compatible plain and simple her faith and ideologies differ greatly from yours, you aren't going to change her and she isn't going to change you if you don't compromise then it simply won't work. Also yes it's reasonable for her not to celebrate Christmas she is Muslim and doesn't believe in celebrating it, should learn about other people's cultures before trying to force someone to do something they aren't comfortable with. Honestly you should have known better and seen this coming"
relationship_advice,fc0jy8p,t1_fc0hpri,1577292521.0,Wow that's sad..
AmItheAsshole,fc0iv5n,t1_fbyol5m,1577291809.0,"Who's to say he is validating? Maybe he is actually confused, if I'm not mistaken this sub was made for people who are unsure if they are in the wrong and some people are more anxious about social situations and could genuinely think they are the asshole when not. YTA for making assumptions based on nothing."
AmItheAsshole,fc0i2ze,t1_fbzp900,1577291320.0,Because it was.
AmItheAsshole,fc0htpb,t3_efcww3,1577291158.0,"NTA if you have been dating for 2 years and ur gift for your SO is a Uno Deck and PJs for a show they never watched it shows you put 0 effort into your gift the fact the price tag is still on means she bought it last minute, only lazy or tacky people leave price tags on gifts. Everyone saying you should be grateful is an idiot and they would be lying to say if they wouldn't get upset. Honestly you don't need to drop a bunch of money for a gift to be thoughtful look at his gifts compared to hers, he knew she would love them he put thought into it and she just went to Walgreens and bought the first 2 things she saw. Sorry your GF is an asshole."
AmItheAsshole,fc0h9jl,t1_fc0ao0j,1577290807.0,Lol they have been dating for 2 years if you are dating ur SO for 2 years and get them an Uno deck for Christmas you're a thoughtless asshole tbh
