depression,f0z2om3,t3_d799lm,1569084896.0,"I feel your pain so much. My case is quite similar. I'm 17, next Friday 18. I wanna get into uni but there's too much pressure. I should focus on my grades but every weekend all I do is watch movies, YouTube, lay in bed or cry because of the fear.

My best friend of 5 years got into a relationship in January too. She's with his so all damn time. Since then we haven't had any encounters just the two of us. It was always her, her boyfriend and me or plus some more friends. One night in the middle of summer when I talked about how depressed I felt, she promised we're gonna watch something in the cinema just the two of us. It has never happened.

When I felt my worst and broke, lost someone, she felt her best and got a relationship. We just cannot relate to each other at this point. We have a completely different mindset. We're still best friends but it's different and more distant. I'm sure if I had a relationship, we'd be better getting along. I'd be less depressed and I wouldn't feel uncomfortable talking about relationships in general. I wouldn't feel lonely.

My parents don't know anything about my mental health. It's kinda sad how little I show and how little they notice.

I know what sleepless nights are like. It's awful when you're putting your arms around yourself because you genuinely feel like you're gonna fall into pieces and you need to keep yourself together. You are not alone. I'm sending you my tightest virtual hug.

Don't give up on your best friend. If you've been buddies for 10 years, he must have a place for you in his heart. Please reach out to him. Explain your feelings. He's gonna appreciate your honesty. You must be caring for him, he'll realize your friendship is important to him and to you too.

Don't ever forget you're not alone. We're all in this together. I'm wishing you the best and sending you all my love."
