Then I flared up.. went down to 163lbs, told it was all in my head.. then was told it was cancer and eventually diagnosed! Since then iv went back to 183lbs and in the gym about 4 times a week.. not near where I was but close!

Went to lots of councillors over the years and this specifically came up.. I hated having to basically start all over again every time I had a flare up.. when you're sick you cant beat urself up for the things you're not able to do!

If ur unsure about meds that your friend is on before she smokes, drugs. Com has a drug interactions checker that can help.. that was my biggest concern.. as I want to be able to function throughout the day .. like alcohol and cannabis is a no go for me unless I'm looking for that kind of buzz!
