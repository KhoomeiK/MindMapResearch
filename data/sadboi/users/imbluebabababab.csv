So, it Bassically consists of the following ‚Äòrules‚Äô

You can have as much ‚Äòfree food‚Äô as you like, so this is your vegetables, fruit, pasta and meat products. 

You can have 2 ‚Äòhealthy A‚Äô choices a day, so this is dairy products, such as 30g of cheese and 350ml of skimmed milk. 

You can healthy 1 ‚Äòhealthy B‚Äô choice a day, which is fibre... so 45g of bran flakes or Cheerios, bread, etc. 

Then you have your ‚Äòsyns‚Äô so this is a point system for treats, as an example a chocolate bar is 6 syns (varies depending on type of chocolate, brand and weight) you can have 15 syns a day. 

Check our their online shop and join the facebook ‚Äòslimming world meal advice and tips‚Äô page, everyone is happy to awnser your questions, but it‚Äôs super effective.
