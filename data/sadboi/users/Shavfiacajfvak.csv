LSD,fqg9q5v,t1_fqg67ig,1589341041.0,"It was difficult. My friend and his kind of girlfriend were over and I felt like they were babysitting me. I felt like such a burden because I tried to talk so much during conversation but I just interrupted shit with nonsense. And if it was piece-able together, that was worse, because those things revealed things I did not want to express or more often such a bad explanation that I had to try to backpedal and go wait no I don‚Äôt mean I drop friends when shit gets hard I mean I don‚Äôt even hang out with Dude except when he‚Äôs with you two, and now that you say he‚Äôs some creep I‚Äôm not gonna start hanging out with him now. But of course what I said sounded like I didn‚Äôt give two fucks about just dropping a friend. And I was embarrassed by my inability to play. This dude 2 years and some change younger than me (I‚Äôm 18) was babysitting me and then I go to play something and it sounds like I‚Äôve regressed two years in musical practice. I could almost seamlessly play the 4 or 5 songs freshest and most recently practiced, but made a lot of pauses to remember shit after those few. I couldn‚Äôt make a bassline to my friend‚Äôs guitar music for shit. The stuff he plays is hard for me though. He doesn‚Äôt rlly know regular chords or songs other people have written a lot. He was dropped on his bead as a baby, got the swine flu and nearly died because he didn‚Äôt go to a doctor. Full on fever hallucinations and all. He‚Äôs autistic but you wouldn‚Äôt know it from talking to him, but then he‚Äôll describe what shit is like for him and it‚Äôs definitely different from ‚Äúnormal‚Äù. 

And yet this motherfucker is running laps around my ass six months after picking up a guitar. His shit is kinda Hendrix-esque, very flowy (as he puts it), more improvisational and less structured, and I like 90s punk (okay really just Green Day and the white stripes) and 60s rock. So I‚Äôm trying to rely on octaves and boy is it not working most of the time. 

Given he knows what I‚Äôm capable of on a good day, we‚Äôve actually had some glimpses of absolute heat in his basement sometimes and it‚Äôs awesome. When we do bass and drums, it‚Äôs always him following me and I know prewritten songs so it doesn‚Äôt feel like an achievement so much but we can regularly get something very good out of it IMO. Of course, easy way is easy, but it‚Äôs fun. I basically watched him learn to play the drums in a week, too, of course without actually learning technique or more than a couple songs. 

And so I‚Äôm just standing there in my dirty ass small ass room with a bass slung on standing there staring at his fingers moving trying to find a root note. Painful. Amp background buzz is the musical equivalent of crickets, it was not great.

Then one of my two ‚Äúbabysitters‚Äù (they knew I was gonna trip but they weren‚Äôt expecting like infancy for two to three hours and an utter jumbled mess for about 8) dropped a joint we were passing around. It got between the headboard and the mattress. I think my male friend went to grab it, but he accidentally moved the mattress away from the headboard a little just by the presence of his fingers in the space there, so it fell through to under my bed. I have shit everywhere. Wrappers and trash spilling from the can in the corner. My dresser and the heater cover the corner but if you look at the corner from sitting on the bed you can see it plain as day. More importantly, I had clothes, cloth instrument cases, a duffel bag and a bunch of just little plastic pieces to whatever I once had and my bad has drawers under it, which come out towards the dresser, and the room is already too narrow to roll the drawers (not attached to the bed, they just roll in and out) without doing geometry to finesse that shit out at a 45 ish degree angle while rotating it so the long side of it is parallel with the long side of the bed. And we can‚Äôt even pull it out enough to start to lift the end up at an angle like that with all the goddamn clothes. I‚Äôm literally face cleaning that area of my room because we can smell shit burning something non weed. I go get someone a glass of water and forget what I‚Äôm doing. We sit down on the bed. We then remember but my male friend says the burning smell stopped. I get the rest of my shit cleared out of the way and take one drawer out. The female friend crawls under the bed and comes back with the unlit joint. My room is now still a mess but also an ashtray in the whole process of this. I have to vacuum so as not to be inconsiderate to my father. I accidentally vacuum a pencil. The brush roller on the vacuum no longer rotates or even tries to. It made a weird sound when it happened but now it doesn‚Äôt even try anything when you press the button. And then my male friend accidentally banged the shit out of my bass‚Äôs neck while it was strapped and in playing position with the neck of my electric guitar. And also then with the acoustic later. He‚Äôs very apologetic. I respond with ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how to repay you‚Äù.

antifeminists,fq5igdh,t1_fgf3t6u,1589106659.0,"That‚Äôs been repeatedly shown to be purely the result of cognitive bias. As a clearly thinking man reading your post written HALF LIKE THIS, I think I‚Äôm gonna have to tell you to stop being so emotional, because reality says you‚Äôre full of shit.

Look, I get that you identify with this issue and that you need to keep your ego from totally collapsing. I‚Äôm not even saying you have a huge ego, but your absolute need for this belief to be true exposes that the ego you have is _fragile._

This is not the way to do it. You don‚Äôt need women to be emotionally clouded to be smart yourself. You don‚Äôt need this (very clearly wrong) worldview to maintain social status. Your value doesn‚Äôt have to be affixed to your sex and these social roles don‚Äôt have to be fixed to be stable. People are dynamic and trying to take ONE way of doing things and making that the permanent norm is really damaging. Society needs structure but you want to stagnate it. Some societies have women in higher social power than men. As a matter of fact, many countries are led by women, like Germany. Many countries are led by men. Success can be found on both sides, so how is your conclusion ‚Äúthere‚Äôs only one right way to do it‚Äù? Society always has needed structure and always will, which means some people have power and some people don‚Äôt, and it‚Äôs impossible to make that fair. But why should it ALWAYS be women? Why can‚Äôt some households operate traditionally and others with the male as the housekeeper and the female as the worker? Spoiler alert: they can and do, with success! 

Nothing needs to take place on your preset frame of things that are acceptable to you. Reality doesn‚Äôt conform to your belief. When you claim women are emotional, it doesn‚Äôt turn Angela Merkel into a hysterical mess. When you claim men are more emotionally clear, that doesn‚Äôt get megachurch pastors to stop yelling and acting dramatic.

Women actually have higher pain tolerance than men, and in my personal experience, as a man, male children tend to be more emotional than female children. This is drawn from memory (of school) and from conversations I‚Äôve had, so my memory may be fallible, but that‚Äôs what I remember. Guys can really be finicky far past childhood though. Especially ‚Äúnice‚Äù ones that can‚Äôt deal with rejection, like at all. They get turned away one too many times and start stockpiling arms and ammo to go shoot somewhere up. Men get REAL emotional, and can be pretty bad at separating those emotions out from what they‚Äôre doing in the moment and to look at things objectively. Like you. Right now. 

Because objectively, the differences between men and women don‚Äôt put either one as biologically superior, and the notion that ‚Äúbeing emotional‚Äù is a female trait is purely made up by other people. It‚Äôs constructed. Fake. Men build muscle faster, women tend to be a little more flexible, and both are _perfectly_ capable of logic and deep, critical thinking."

medizzy,fpp2sbs,t1_fpp0pw5,1588794955.0,"So the big issue here is that nobody attacked you and you‚Äôre acting like they did. We are not discussing what self identified pro-lifers want. We are discussing the actual laws that are actually in place that have actually LITERALLY kept a raped 13 year old from legally aborting. She was forced to carry to term. Now do I think you or pro-lifers on the street at random would agree with this? No, I think most wouldn‚Äôt and you‚Äôve made it clear that you certainly don‚Äôt. Is your, or your base‚Äôs opinion what‚Äôs being discussed in the first place? Of course not. Now to be fair by law that girl was ALLOWED to have an abortion, but strict regulations designed to shut facilities down meant she literally couldn‚Äôt get one unless she traveled out of state, which made the legalities AND the actual REalitiesof it even more complicated. If memory serves me right, travel to the nearest state that she could actually get an abortion in practice had a prohibitively high price, and thus she carried to term.

I understand that you feel misrepresented, but what I want you to understand is that you aren‚Äôt being presented in any way at all here. This is a conversation about the legislature (and the realities that actually happen in practice), not about shaming you. You identify with this topic, but when we discuss that topic, that doesn‚Äôt mean we‚Äôre putting words in your mouth. Nobody is, nobody‚Äôs misconstruing your position if nobody even knew you were here until you opened your mouth to complain. You have nothing to do with it. 

Your position on the topic is definitely more defensible than many other positions people take. You have your logic and more importantly you agree that circumstance matters in these situations, which is a key thing to see eye to eye on. So I‚Äôm not attacking your view, I actually totally understand it even if I really disagree with it. I‚Äôm not attacking it and neither was anyone else. You‚Äôre not the one writing this shit into law, so there‚Äôs no need to feel like we‚Äôre bashing you. The man literally pointed out something that‚Äôs totally true (key being depending on the state/area) and that objective truth is not an attack on you. As a matter of fact, we can probably all agree that the way these things are written and implemented is shitty, I actually think we can agree on a lot more than you might think.

PornhubComments,fn576cc,t3_fz86e5,1586657568.0,"I feel like I love the girl I‚Äôm talking to right now, and right after I got that free premium I stopped using it in favor of thinking of her.

Once you have love, or something you want to call love, sexual needs feel more natural IMO. Like it‚Äôs not just pleasurable, but it‚Äôs right. It‚Äôs a man thinking of his girl, not some video on the internet. The latter works when you need it to but the former just takes the cake... no post-nut pining for a girl to lie with when you know she‚Äôs waiting for you once you can leave your damn township. Or at least it‚Äôs not hopeless pining. Idm why I wrote this but life is better when you find a person you can invest yourself in. There‚Äôs something bizarre and incredible in kind of just picking a person and deciding that they‚Äôre worth everything just because you like them. That their very existence makes them worthy of your affection. You can‚Äôt really decide who you see like that consciously but it‚Äôs just kind of a beautifully arbitrary thing. I just happen to love her. 


At the same time, yes, we can dissect this and decide that there‚Äôs a formula to it, that people want someone similar to them but not identical, that it‚Äôs not ‚Äúarbitrary‚Äù, but all I meant by that is that nobody‚Äôs worth more than anyone else and yet certain people will become your entire world. Just because.

And then you can start to feel fulfilled even after just pleasing yourself, at least for me. It feels right. May this man find who he needs."

Edit: yeah I wasn‚Äôt thinking too hard about it when I wrote it but I think what you‚Äôre seeing is me trying to demonstrate a change in mental state not a passage of time.

I just didn‚Äôt want to appear like I didn‚Äôt see what was wrong there, not that I‚Äôm older and sage or something, but just that I‚Äôm not behaving that way anymore. Kind of distancing myself from something that I‚Äôm not anymore, not to say I never touch a drug now, but that I didn‚Äôt have such shenanigans after that incident and I don‚Äôt intend to start up again. Too many psychs can, quite honestly, make you feel a little retarded after a while. It got old. And very strong embarrassment can really turn you a hundred eighty degrees in the regard that you were embarrassed. Strong incentive."
shrooms,fmuti1c,t1_fmu8rxv,1586398537.0,"This is me to a tee. I tend to look at the news when I‚Äôm tripping and blow things out of proportion, though... one time I emailed my English teacher because I wanted his opinion on something I was essentially making up. I saw a video on an article but managed to convince myself (??) that the video was a public broadcast forced onto everyone‚Äôs phone screen. The video was on the article ‚Äútrump is stalling an intel report that warns the US isn‚Äôt ready for a pandemic‚Äù. I remember the headline of the article very clearly because it was slightly wordy for my tripping ass and I spent five minutes reading it and comprehending it before opening the article. And this video started with coronavirus stuff and I interpreted the ending as an implied denunciation of the administration - but if it was a public forced broadcast (obviously, because we get those all the time and they‚Äôre so real (????)), then that meant the government was doing a ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not saying the words‚Äù denunciation. Sorta the vibes of someone being forced at gunpoint to make a video saying something and they try to sneak in a plea for help. Except it‚Äôs politicians fearing their jobs. And so in my infinite wisdom I emailed my English teacher, and the look I received the next day in school was utter disappointment. I checked my sent emails, and sure enough, there‚Äôs an email from me to him with the subject ‚ÄúTHAT‚Äù, followed by ‚ÄúWe should definitely talk about it. Before class????‚Äù. Luckily he knew I‚Äôm a stoner and that could definitely be written off as a weed thing, and he wasn‚Äôt about to flip his shit over that sort of thing. He definitely didn‚Äôt like me doing that, though, I wouldn‚Äôt either. He never said anything about it, really, but I sure know I‚Äôd worry about where the line is with this idiot kid. I wouldn‚Äôt want that dumbass getting me implicated in his ‚Äústoned‚Äù email escapades, as all of that stuff is always accessible to the administration once it‚Äôs sent. I‚Äôm sure glad that was the worst of my shenanigans, though I had several instances where I said something incredibly awkward to him while high or dexxed out (DXM) at school. I was real fuckin slick, but after my emailing antics I never had another incident like that that I‚Äôll remember in 40 years as I try to sleep. Luckily I have quite enough of those already.

Goddammit."
LSD,fmqirfe,t3_fwlbeq,1586300409.0,"I‚Äôve literally done shit like that. I emptied the medicine cabinet and took the shower curtains off to prevent me from warping through space-time into North Korea. I took all the tissues out of the box trying to take single atoms off the tissues. I would grab a corner, tear it off, and try to twist it so it got really thin. And the goal was atom width. Also, time was mirroring itself (things would happen and then happen again in the opposite order, like time was flipped) because I was approaching the end of my life infinitely closer and closer, like it was right around the corner but every moment dragged on, never arriving like some sort of xeno‚Äôs arrow (or whatever it‚Äôs called) type shit. Getting infinitely closer, millimeters away, but never there. And this was causing my experience of space time to warp, making me experience things and then experience them again in reverse. Or so I thought. I thought it was that inexplicable shit people talk about happening right before death, only it was just completely outlandish. Crazy shit."
