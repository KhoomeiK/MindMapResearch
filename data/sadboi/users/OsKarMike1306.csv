todayilearned,fr1poqp,t1_fr11hol,1589823832.0,"In Quebec, we have a community called the Magoua that are essentially descendants of mixed relationships between the Natives and the French. With time and British indoctrination, they were slowly discriminated against even by French descendants (my dad being born in Trois-Rivières, he has some...unsavory stories about the Magoua neighbourhood and its inhabitants), but they are also discriminated by other Natives that do not consider them Natives at all.

It kind of makes sense as Native ancestry can be lost through generations of Magoua pairings and the only remnant of their Native claims would be in their historically dedicated neighbourhoods where poverty, drug use and lack of education just so happen to be rampant. Essentially, you can't prove they have Native ancestry since they've been mixing with the Canadian population well before the Indian Act (well before it was called Canada actually) and they were isolated by both the Natives and ""pure-bred"" Canadians prior to the act being enforced.

They also have a specific joual slang called Magoua that's essentially the same as joual, which is already heavily influenced by numerous Native languages in addition to English, that actually takes even more from ancien régime French in the verb tenses for example."
writers,fr1hcpa,t1_fr1caau,1589819743.0,"Thank you so much for the feedback, you brought some very interesting ideas, I haven't really thought of a median-desired punishment despite fleshing out a court system.

The court system I concocted so far is based around a ""judge"" that is a branch of the universal AI whose purpose is to, as explained previously, officialize and enforce laws, but also condemn anyone guilty of breaking those laws. As such, the jury is comprised of humans selected randomly that will ""work"" on the case as a regular jury would, but will also propose a punishment (which they will vote on unanimously, any disagreeing party will get to submit an alternative sentence once and will have their vote annulled if rejected by the other jurors, subsequently being replaced by another randomly selected juror who will be filled on with a court transcript or video footage of the case). This is the part I added in light of your note regarding punishment. Once the verdict and sentence (if applicable) are submitted, it will be sent to a number of randomly selected citizens for a vote, with a short summary of the case, which requires a majority of 70% to pass, then compiled by the AI for the official sentencing.

At that point, I need to explain the ""work"" aspect of the society: no one legitimately works, as the entire workforce is completely mechanized and taken care by a hybrid system of check and balance between system report machines (like anti-viruses, they simply detect problems and attempt to fix them through other sets of machines) and human engineers. This should make currency obsolete as anything can be made synthetically and for free, but also, ""work"" is actually hobbies used for distraction and encouraging critical thinking, with the actual human work such as say lawyers (validation), scientist (innovation) or teachers (information) being equally distributed among the appropriate percentage of the population with those occupation as part of their obligatory ""humanity advancement"" projects, a set period of time each day dedicated to philanthropic projects, they rest being essentially free time to explore other interests, projects or simply socialize. As such, this is a society that should theoretically help each other as the primary goal (in practice, and I suppose that could be a plot point, this shouldn't be the case 100% of the time because humanity is flawed).

For the community aspect, I adore the idea, but it's also the main plot of the third novel and, not to get into too much detail, it is the conclusion of that thought experiment as I have a satisfying way to tie this into this ""objective democracy"" without plugging all the holes of the philosophy. In short, it doesn't solve the problem, but it does comment directly on it and the alternative as the end of the story."
writers,fr1d7pb,t1_fr1ac49,1589817660.0,"Thank you so much for the feedback. There is a major plot point in the first novel that the ""system"" was put into place because of overpopulation, which led to its first order of business being a systematic, randomly-selected, mass genocide. It was passed and enforced to lead to the current ""utopian"" situation.

I was thinking of making this event repeat as a turning point in the second novel to sow suspicion on the beliefs in the woman and make the man work towards a ""revolution"" so to speak, but I fear it might be redundant and I would need more nuanced positions that would lead to it, like say a law that would make abortion illegal barely passing (I'm just spitballing, not a huge fan of that idea as it seems rather cliché)."
writers,fr1bkdu,t1_fr19if2,1589816833.0,"I'll second this comment, but also point out that, depending on the language, inflection is crucial to understanding a language without knowing what is being said.

Here's an example in French: ""Ta voix me donne la forte envie de consommer un des tes étrons car je ne peux imaginer que ton cul produise quoique ce soit de pire goût""

I'm not sure how you could possibly understand this is as scathing insult or an incredible compliment without the use of Google or saying it with the intended inflection (I actually challenge you to guess with translating to prove my point).

That said, you can go around that issue by precisely describing the body language of the characters or the tone of their voice if you wish the concerned character to be as much in the dark as the audience (or, part of the audience rather, if you use a real language). If you use a different language that the concerned character understands but still wish to keep the audience in the dark for plot purposes, you can make it seem more natural by completely ignoring any kind of exposition based on what is being said, write as the character acknowledged what is being said without directly acting/reacting on it.

A concrete example of this would be, by using my previous French sentence: ""They must be very close to have this kind of exchange, I wish I had this kind of relationship with someone, even if just to feel something valuable for once. Strong emotions are a luxury lately.""

Then you can carry on with an external dialogue in the foreign language as such, if the character understands and speaks the language: ""J'espère que vous appréciez la sincérité de votre ami, Monsieur, aussi crue soit-elle. J'imagine que la fourberie est beaucoup plus acerbe que la plus dure des vérités, si vous voulez mon avis.""

This is simply an example of how you could make a conversation in a two languages without saying what is actually being told, but you can also translate it in a note or immediately point out that they're talking in the concerned language before going into the dialogue in English."

AskReddit,fquqfjs,t1_fquo8os,1589663000.0,"Oh I 100% agree with everything you said. Beyond the fanservice, it's a remarkably well written anime. I've rarely been finessed that easily by a show when it comes to the plot, the pacing is near perfect. The aesthetic, the themes, the oddly philosophical implications, it's truly an amazing allegory about totalitarianism, every episode blew me away.

Also, the art style is, as you so eloquently pointed out, absurdly well detailed and exaggerated, I haven't been that blown away by animation until the first season One Punch Man.

You're right in pointing out that the show didn't even need the fanservice but I think it adds another layer of empowerment to Kill La Kill, especially considering that it's immediately addressed, becomes a plot point and is applied to every character in the show regardless of gender. I think the fact that it uses nudity in such a way elevates it from purely gratuitous fanservice to an actual artistic statement.

The problem is that you need to watch the show to understand that, it otherwise just looks like any other vaguely sexist and explicit anime."

I dragged them to open mics a few times, sent them some songs and random poems I or others wrote that I found interesting.

My reasoning behind giving them my book was because the subject matter would have an entire different dimension for appreciation by knowing me personally. I tell stories that they participated in and I thought they might find it interesting to see my perspective. I always had a lot of communication issues (stutter and seriously impaired social skills due to mental disorders) and realized pretty early on that writing allowed me to connect with people more efficiently, so I wrote my observations and my thoughts in hopes they'd resonate with people.

For the record, my poems do seem to strike a very specific chord in people who have been exposed to them as I've got extensive feedback from strangers at open mic, teachers and my more literary-oriented friends. My therapist read the entire thing and pointed out how I'm talking about realities/situations that most of her patients know about but aren't talked at all. My writing has often been compared to De Sade, Baudelaire and even Bukowski (I deserve none of that praise honestly) in terms of toeing the line between elegance and rawness (I say ugly things in pretty ways, essentially). They read some of my work and they, by all accounts, enjoyed it thoroughly, so I figured an entire book of the best I can muster would be at least a little interesting to them.

You also take into account how much self doubt and insecurities I have for my work, which amounts to why I willingly sent my work to people I knew wouldn't care. In some way, I wished I would be wrong and they'd take my first official big project as an opportunity to understand me better and influence their perspective on life from someone who forced himself to always see the beauty in it.

My point is I thought I had something important on my hand, something that I felt could touch people and it only took one person to believe in me for me to get essentially my dream job. I've only been good at two things: writing and making music. I honed those skills through sheer passion, but writing is so much harder to get out there since it requires patience, a lot of it.

So I waited, I kept at it until I could get my voice heard and someone, down the line, knew I had something special so she made sure I'd get my words out.

I did it out of passion and desire to connect with people, now I'm just looking for a way to do it enough to not have to do anything else.

I hope you get back into writing, even if it's just for you. It's a special kind of therapy that allows you to get everything out without any other consequence but creating art and I definitely wouldn't be here today if it weren't for that outlet. It doesn't have to be good, it just has to be real to you, maybe it'll be real to someone else too."
sadcringe,fqrk9bq,t1_fqrhmt7,1589586048.0,"Oh yeah, I guess ""everyone of my friends"" was a bit of an exaggeration because I have a few friends that took me aside to talk about a specific poem that I happen to be very proud of.

Hearing them talk about how much my words resonated with them is indescribable, especially considering the subject matter of the collection. It was written over a very tumultuous period of time in my life where I often went the deep end and I attempted to put words on emotional situations I went through during that time, which is why the final title is ""Pays Bipolaire"", or ""Bipolar Country"" in English. 

I wanted to paint a picture of someone struggling with trauma, substance abuse, existential angst and, more importantly, mood swings. It's full of contrasts between beauty and ugliness I observed, with light poems about innocuous situations or hard hitting fantasies. By showing some poems in open mics and creative classes, it slowly became clear to me that I was writing things people from my generation needed to be put into words, things they experienced like looking at a hospital wall while under observation because it's the only distraction you have after an attempt. There's also some political commentary regarding my ambivalent feelings for my home country (Quebec, Canada), drug trip reports and tales/anecdotes I collected through talking with strangers in bars. It's a collection that finds a balance between how hard life is and how fascinating it is, which describes my own experience but also a common experience that I consider eminently contemporary.

Sorry for the wall of text, I don't really get to talk about my work often and it consists of about 80 poems I consider myself proud to get out there...out of the 500+ I produced over time, so it's rare for me to be enthusiastic over something I made."

Hmmm I would if I could meet people and practice. I'm a musician as well but I don't really have the tools to adapt my poetry to music for my liking. I can sing pretty decently and play the harmonica, but I'm not sure that'll be enough for the aesthetic I'm looking for.

My style is already pretty experimental so it's not like I can just slap a poem on a 4/4 song structure and call it a day, there's some composition needed if I want to go down that road and spoken word/experimental music isn't exactly popular anyway so I doubt that anyone will listen to it more than they'll read it."

sadcringe,fqrerhn,t3_gkhnvx,1589582920.0,"I'm a poet and one thing I've learned with poetry is that nobody cares about poetry except other poets/writers. I wrote a poem collection that was going to be published in June (not anymore, obviously) and sent it to all of my friends/family for feedback/support.

Every one of them said they read it, so I asked them which one they liked the most. Unsurprisingly, it was always random poems at the beginning, so I decided to ask them for opinions about putting in a foreword or not. They unanimously replied that I should put in a foreword.

I already put a foreword, first page of the book, to introduce the concept of the collection. They hadn't even open the damn book until I asked them for feedback and they just gave the first poem they saw.

Edit: Some of you are taking this more seriously than I am. I didn't mean anything by doing that, I was just proud of my work and they requested to see it. The rest is just me trying to judge the value of their feedback, so to speak. There was no malicious intent beyond seeking confirmation.

Also, I'm not discounting the distinct possibility that I'm an arrogant idiot who writes shitty poetry if we're being honest."

HistoryMemes,fqmm3yg,t1_fqmf6dm,1589479718.0,"We don't learn much of Canada or the US in Quebec. Once the British take over, we basically focus almost exclusively on Quebec and how many times we got screwed over. I have no idea why we got territories instead of provinces, I'm not really sure where PEI is, I basically know nothing of Canadian expansion after Louis Riel and most Prime Ministers are covered very briefly, except when they specifically did something against Quebec (Daddy Trudeau is talked about extensively and both referendums are given in-depth attention).

For example, we know the US declared independance in 1776 because of the Loyalists forcing the creation of Ontario in 1791. I can tell you that Montreal was founded in 1642, Quebec City in 1608, Champlain was allied with most Natives except the Iroquois (despite Cartier establishing contact with them first, so that was awkward) and the Union Act was an attempt at assimilation after the Patriot Rebellions in 1837-38, but I just now learned that there was rebellions in Upper Canada too, something we were never taught.

I'd be lying if I said it didn't feel a bit manipulative or like propaganda that we omit so much information about our own country, but it's generally agreed upon in Quebec that there's Quebec and the RoC. After failing to secede twice, it feels like most of us are fine being a culturally-different country, even if we're definitely not in any other way.

It encourages the xenophobia though, which I'm not super comfortable with personally."
