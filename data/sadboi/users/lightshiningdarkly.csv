Although, it‚Äôs a little different in my case because I have been transparent with my family in that after trying a few more things to try to help myself out of this deep, dark depression I‚Äôve been stuck in for so many years, I will be leaving. They are aware and even though they don‚Äôt want that, they also don‚Äôt want me suffering. I have about 5 more things to try. Nothing has ever worked before. I‚Äôve been on all the psych meds you can name, done many treatments, now I am on to Ketamine infusion therapy. After that I will try MAOI‚Äôs, ECT, and TMS, and then I am out of here. A person can only take so much. I‚Äôm so sorry for your loss. Here is a poem I found in the death subreddit. I hope it brings you some sense of peace, even for just a moment. I wish you the best. 

Death Is Nothing At All

By Henry Scott-Holland

Death is nothing at all. It does not count. I have only slipped away into the next room. Nothing has happened.

Everything remains exactly as it was. I am I, and you are you, and the old life that we lived so fondly together is untouched, unchanged. Whatever we were to each other, that we are still.

Call me by the old familiar name. Speak of me in the easy way which you always used. Put no difference into your tone. Wear no forced air of solemnity or sorrow.

Laugh as we always laughed at the little jokes that we enjoyed together. Play, smile, think of me, pray for me. Let my name be ever the household word that it always was. Let it be spoken without an effort, without the ghost of a shadow upon it.

Life means all that it ever meant. It is the same as it ever was. There is absolute and unbroken continuity. What is this death but a negligible accident?

Why should I be out of mind because I am out of sight? I am but waiting for you, for an interval, somewhere very near, just round the corner.

All is well. Nothing is hurt; nothing is lost. One brief moment and all will be as it was before. How we shall laugh at the trouble of parting when we meet again!

I honestly don‚Äôt see the point of living. Unless you have kids to raise, I don‚Äôt see the point at all. What‚Äôs it all for? Go to work, come home, eat, go to bed, drink and party on the weekends, repeat for eternity until you‚Äôre dead or retired, when you‚Äôre too old and sore and slow to enjoy the things people generally only get to go do after age 65.

I would drop things because I couldn‚Äôt grasp things correctly and couldn‚Äôt move correctly. It‚Äôs like I was in super slow motions and couldn‚Äôt coordinate myself. It was the most uncomfortable feeling ever. I think that‚Äôs referred to as extrapyramidal symptoms or what not. Crazy shit!

I have the thoughts all the time because I can‚Äôt feel genuine joy or pleasure anymore, thanks in part to meth (past use) and in part to his suicide.

Mantises don‚Äôt survive winter but inside can survive. Just need proper housing which you can google or check out mantis related FB groups too. You can get feeder crickets at any pet store for her and she will love them most likely. Ours did. They also love moths! They love plants. We had a marigold plant for our mantis and she would chill on it a lot. A lot of people use an aquarium with a mesh lining on the inside of the lid. You can always let her out to hang out with you or what not. They‚Äôre very human friendly. Ours brought us so much joy and we miss her.

Thankfully I have a loving partner and family but still I am not ok and never will be again. I just push through the days and sleep as much as a human can. I just want to go back and make things different. I have not accepted it, nor have I forgiven him for leaving us. This is why I need trauma therapy. My not forgiving him keeps him chained to earth. I need to let him go... and yet I hold on so tight. I get scared... scared I‚Äôll forget his face. Scared of the nightmares that haunt me. Scared of never being the same again. Scared I may never see him again. I don‚Äôt know what happens to suicides but I don‚Äôt believe in hell. After all, if there is a hell, it is HERE. Here on earth.

It has become unbearable and I feel I am very close to doing the only thing I can to escape it. I cannot live this way. What I struggle with is courage. I need it so badly.
ExNoContact,f1rjud9,t3_daktnc,1569716528.0,I‚Äôve been through this exact same thing. What a beautiful feeling it is to not give a shit anymore. I went through hell with that grief and I thought it would never end. I nearly took my life over her. Now I finally see her for what she really is. A pathetic manipulative loser who leaves a trail of destruction in her wake. Thank God I am no longer delusional and can see her for the demon she is. Good for you on your progress. They don‚Äôt deserve us. They never did. I‚Äôm proud of you.
