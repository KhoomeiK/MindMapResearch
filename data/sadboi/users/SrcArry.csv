schizophrenia,fq8tsi2,t3_gh82rn,1589175316.0,"I find if I walk up a steep hill, or do some mildly intense excercise while thinking about frustrating things, it seems to physiologically trick my body into feeling like it has been fighting. Afterwards, because I feel like I have TRIED to fight, there is less of a reason to focus on frustrating things because I feel like I have already done the best I can to resolve them. It's all very subconscious I find.

I heard our minds are more in service to our bodies than our bodies to our minds (we use our minds to gather food to sustain our bodies). If you make your body feel like it has been in a fight, it asks the mind to give it rest, and the mind naturally tries to give it that service.

I hope I have addressed your question somewhat."

Aquariums,fpjlpx0,t1_fpjijyn,1588673234.0,"Hmm, really? I'm pretty new to this knowledge area so I could easily be wrong but... The Australian Aqua One filter's page is [here](https://aquaone.com.au/2015-04-16-04-47-04/filtration/internal-filters-2/item/2706-11331-11332-11334-11333-11334). Everything I can find says the 104F filter is suitable for up to a 180 Litre (47.5 Gallon) tank. If the rating on that website is for without filter media then that is quite misleading for people..."
Aquariums,fpjkfea,t1_fpjijyn,1588671852.0,"Ok i'll have to look into that, Thanks for the information!"
Aquariums,fpjic7w,t1_fpjhwg4,1588669593.0,"Yes, thanks, that's what I read online ‚ò∫ I got an Aqua One 104F internal filter incase you're interested. I'm in Australia so we kinda go by litres mostly.. The tanks is 156 litres and the filter is rated at 1480 litres per hour so just a bit below what you recommended I think."

Aquariums,fpjfnwl,t1_fpje16m,1588666751.0,"Sorry, what exactly is the danger?

The fish in the video and the moor I mentioned have actually been in the same 10 gallon tank for ages and I'm just concerned that they're missing each other atm :( They haven't had any problems together except the moor chases around the other one a bit!"
Aquariums,fpjdbq0,t1_fpjc7bb,1588664391.0,Yes it has faded a bit. It has been in not great conditions tbh since I got it... I had this one and a black moor in a 10 gallon tank. This is a new tank and I'm trying to give it a better life. I'll be adding the moor soon hopefully if the tank has cycled somewhat. Hopefully the fish will colour back up in a while...

godot,fkivl5u,t1_fkigulf,1584229680.0,Maybe because they're proud of working so hard and doing such a good job for someone their age. A 15yo would be right to be proud of this and it's smart to advertise they're young talent.
