My body feels like I have to be constantly moving and I get how OP describes it. When you say ""mouth pain"" do you mean more tooth ache-like? I get jaw pain when I'm experiencing akathisia. I don't realize I'm doing it, but I'm clenching my jaw real tight and it's giving me painful TMJ. Or I tend to grind my teeth without realizing it. Did you do this?"

askgaybros,f650wcg,t3_dqg70y,1572697900.0,"The way I judge Chick-Fil-A is how I'm treated when I'm there. I worked at one when I was in high school and at no point did anyone (employee or customer) ever say or do anything homophobic that I was aware of. Additionally, when I go as a customer, I've never felt judged and no employee has ever said or done anything to imply homophobia.

I can understand peoples' thoughts behind a boycott, but for me the company has treated me with respect every single time I have ever been.

Edit: forgot to reply to OP's question. Considering everything I said above, I don't think it's fair to assume every customer is homophobic. Some people simply don't care about the politics of a business and want to go somewhere with a good product and even better customer service."

I currently see a psych that is only self-pay because when I was on the verge of a breakdown and realized I needed help I called 37 psychs; that's not an exaggeration. They were all either not accepting new patients or didn't have an appt for at least 2 months out. It's crazy that in a point in my life where I finally realized I need help it wasn't available -- which adds to the anxiety, depression, and frustration."

But is that starting to become manic or not?

Also, I posted asking people of they can realize they are being (hypo)manic and some do at the moment. I don't get how people know because, again, to me it's normal everyday life -- which may be the issue in and of itself."
askgaybros,f5ro8fx,t3_dowh9z,1572399002.0,"I know you want to be with him because you really like him. I think it would be ok for you to personally decide how large a role sexual satisfaction is for you and the role you want it to it play in the relationship.

I think that as long as you have made true, honest, and open attempts to relay how you feel and what you want in the relationship (not just make him horny) and you don't get what you want out of it, then feel free to leave him. Again, I know you really like him and are in a relationship that has a lot of what you've been waiting years for, but use this opportunity to learn more about yourself and what you want in a relationship. Don't compromise everything you want in a successful and happy relationship for instant gratification (I'm not saying you are).

Plus, of you find that person where you both mutually hit all the wants in a relationship, then it has a higher chance of success, leading to even more happiness. And if y'all want an open relationship and agree to it, then do whatever makes the both of you happy. Remember, you may not know the reasoning behind the way he is behaving. It very well may be ED for some medical reason and he's embarrassed. Or, he doesn't think or want sex to play such a huge role. You won't know unless you open up to him. You will drive yourself crazy, keep guessing, and make bad assumptions if you don't communicate -- which is a great thing to learn being in a relationship at a young age. Let this relationship help you learn and grow to be the person you want to be and know what you are looking for in a long-term commitment."

gaybros,f3a94qn,t3_dg839c,1570764996.0,"If it's Atlanta Pride, there will be tons of people, not NYC tons, but an awful lot. Since it takes place in Piedmont Park the booths will be along the foot path of the park with booths on either side. It will be very, very crowded. My suggestion, don't walk that path, take parts where there is grass. There are parts with large open areas -- you can use these areas to cut across. That's really the most crowded part where at time you would be pushing up against, or rubbing against other people with people yelling and being eccentric. Hold your boyfriend's hand if that'll make you feel better. This will most likely be the most triggering part for someone with anxiety and panic disorder. I have experienced this.

It's a very popular Pride event, but have fun and just mentally prepare yourself for a large crowd. Don't freak yourself out, though. Have fun and enjoy it. Since you're going to the parade, I would stand near the Park entrance where it ends. This way your not bum rushing it in with those walking from the start of the parade, and if the crowds are too overwhelming, you will already be in the park so you can walk away. It's a large park, so if you need a break walk around. You're also in the city, so leave the park and walk around the Piedmont neighborhood if you need to.

Again, have fun. The parade is not boring at all. I won't be there this year, so enjoy for the both of us (assuming you're in A)"
ADHD,f38ah27,t1_f37gph3,1570734857.0,"From my understanding, and I'm not a mental health professional, OCD is when a person has to do a certain routine a certain number of times. This is the compulsion portion of OCD. Or, a person has thoughts that are repeated over and over in one's head -- the obsessive part of OCD. A person with OCD has to do these actions because not doing so would would manifest a mental and/or physical reaction that would drive the person, for lack of a better word, insane (please don't be offended by my word choice).

Having ADHD myself, I can relate to the OP's post as I have done the same things several times. I think what she's saying (I'm assuming ""she"" due to the name) is that when she watched the initial video it was because she wanted to, presumably with the intent to watch only that video. But the ADHD kicks in when she got stuck in the YouTube rabbit hole as many have. However, what makes this different, is that this rabbit hole took her out of her environment without regards to what she was supposed to be doing. Sure, everyone gets distracted, but with my ADHD, I lose track of time, I forget what I was supposed to be doing, and I start doing other stuff completely irrelevant to why I started a task in the first place. The fact that she didn't even realize time had went by and was consumed with multiple things at once shows part of her ADHD. Assuming I'm right, it's because she wasn't obsessed with what she was doing and didn't feel she had to do it or her day would be irriversably ruined that distinguishes it from OCD.

Also, she took her meds and still had the damn song stuck in her head anyway. The struggle is real.

OP, if I'm wrong, feel free to tell me to f*ck off."

My mind goes crazy, I'm mentally and physically anxious, but tired at the same time. It's really weird and I don't know how to feel for a while."

I was taking meds to make me sleep because not being able to pushed me closer to an episode. When I can't sleep and am not tired (like right now) I only have 2 actions. Either obsess over something (internet rabbit hole for hours on one topic, like my subreddit browsing right now), or I question all my life decisions and hang on to what I could have done and what could have been and how it's too late to change. Absolutely sucks.

I prefer the obsessive rabbit hole because it distracts me from everything... unless it's looking at social media and how everyone's life seems better than mine. Hang in there."

It's not until it's done and I have had a 5 minute break from the situation that I realize I f*cked up. Then it's all instant regret, guilt, shame, and anxiety from what's going to come out of it. It's just a sick cycle of feelings and emotions."
ADHD,f325e4f,t3_df6bs3,1570594133.0,"Hang in there, OP. My now husband felt the same way before we got married. But ultimately, I had to do what was best for myself; how was I going to ask another person to marry me if I can't recognize when I need help for myself? The back-and-forth arguing lasted a while because I had no idea how to explain my actions and I thought ADHD as an adult was an excuse for random misbehaviors. 

In the end, I got help from my psych and now we don't argue nearly as much about the stuff we used to for two very distinct reasons: 1) a lot of my actions caused by my ADHD eventually lessened in both frequency and severity, and 2) knowing I was working with my psych on how to deal with ADHD with both medication and self-awareness, it helped give me more responsibility for my actions and empathize with my husband's feelings. 

So when I do something that upsets him and is ADHD-related, I tell him that I'm sorry and more importantly, that I appreciate him telling me what he observed. If he observed my symptoms are worsening, then I can bring that to my psych. This way, my husband plays a role in helping my ADHD because outsiders can be great source of seeing whether or not a change has been made. Because my husband sees the obvious changes since starting medication, he now realizes that a lot of things from the past really weren't because I didn't care or I was disinterested in what he had to say. It truly was for the best."
bipolar,f2gitd4,t3_dd0cm3,1570231160.0,"I'm recently married to another man so adoption or surrogacy is really our only two options. We discussed going the surrogacy route because we wanted a ""part"" of is to be with the child. I decided not to be the one to donate sperm because I didn't want my diabetes or bipolar being passed down by me.

It makes sense but then quickly became a sad reality. After a while I realized that merely having a kid would truly be a gift and have since accepted the reality of the situation. I feel for everyone that has thought about this. For me, I feel like it's the best way to allow my child the best and freshest start at life. I couldn't imagine being the person that ""gave"" someone bipolar."
