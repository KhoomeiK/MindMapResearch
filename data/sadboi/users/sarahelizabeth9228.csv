Lumbar puncture to check for meningitis,
3 cannulas for various antibiotics,
A main line for medicine,
A tube for feeding,
Multiple ambulance trips to various specialist hospitals,
CT scan with contrast on bowels

I remember seeing all these tiny babies and just  being amazed at how strong they all were.

I hope your little one is ok now!"
happy,fgjinxd,t1_fgjgfpp,1580844841.0,"It truly was. The hospital he had his operation in was about 30 miles away from where we lived so I had the guilt of going home at night after being there for 12 hours to sleep. Or I stayed on the reclining chair and didn’t get any sleep and was useless the next day! The nurses had to tell me it was ok to leave.

We have tried to give him the healthiest of diets that we can and luckily he seems to enjoy fruit and vegetables. I’ve avoided all the usual crisps and chocolate and sweets. He has plenty of time in life to enjoy them.

When he was just having milk he definitely was drinking a lot more than other babies. He was having slightly smaller bottles but more often. He still has a bottle throughout the night and he’s 14 months! Food wise.. the kid could eat for England.

We weren’t really told what to avoid. So that has been a fun journey. We have learnt that if he has bread at lunch and pasta for dinner then he is in agony at night and will spend hours screaming in pain. We’re still figuring it all out but honestly he’s not had any complications since. I think we’ve been lucky."

It was fairly messy when we were first weaning and we had quite a few items of clothes that had to be thrown away but the past few months have been better. We did learn the hard way about having pasta too close to bed though. It gives him terrible trapped wind and I was spending 3 or 4 hours a night trying to comfort him.

Basically what happened was, his appendix burst when he was a few days old and unfortunately was never picked up. The hospital thought he had a hole in his bowel and pumped lots of antibiotics through him. 
Eventually all of the infection ate away at his bowels and he needed a big chunk removed. They thought he might need a stoma but fortunately everything worked perfectly after!"
