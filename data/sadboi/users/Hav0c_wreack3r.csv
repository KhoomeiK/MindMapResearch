I know someone with bipolar disorder I, and yes, if not on the right cocktail of meds the mania can feel like a high, however, like i said, it takes the right cocktail for someone with that illness to live a normal life.

The point of this post is, should OP try to be a little bit more understanding and examine if his SO doesn‚Äôt suffer from any of these conditions?

None of those dates will work for us. We told them. And yet they still cannot refund us our deposit.
