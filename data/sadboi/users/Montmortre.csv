Paranormal,fqule6v,t3_gl0p8l,1589660781.0,"I have a shadow person in my home as well. He has scared me badly twice but all of the other times, he is mundane but still noticeable. I was lounging on the rug once and he passed by me very fast. I had the type of response where when someone fake slaps at you and you jump back? That‚Äôs what I did and when I looked around, nothing was there. I was home alone so it was no one else. The other time was when I saw him peek into my doorway when I was attempting to sleep. I know that it is a former resident as my house was built over the foundation of a former plantation home. I also have other experiences with apparitions that lead me to that same time period. I have the gift of being able to feel presences but I cannot see them except for him."

depression,fqufjyd,t1_fqtmvej,1589658061.0,Same. I left medical school because I could not handle the depression and anxiety that was my life. I am still ashamed of myself and embarrassed because all eyes were on me to succeed. Now I feel that I‚Äôve let everyone down. I work at a bank in my hometown while getting my MBA in Healthcare Administration but it just isn‚Äôt the same as having those MD credentials after your name. I hope that you are doing well.
