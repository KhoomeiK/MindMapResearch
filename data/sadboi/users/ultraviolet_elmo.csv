antinatalism,f6u2a6i,t3_dt0i9w,1573157178.0,"This is pretty biased. Many developing countries have a low mortality rate. Babies die at a young age so women have alot babies because its expected that some of the babies will die. 

Also, children are expensive in developed countries. In developing countries, children help parents with farming or selling their products in the market. 

Also many people in developing countries can't read (especially women). They wouldnt know how to read ""birth control"" even if they tried. 

In rural areas, its hard for women to reach health centers. The lack of transportation and the long distance of health clinics makes it really hard.

War can be a major contributing factor aswell.

 Basically, many women in these countries might not want children, but the odds are against them.   We have more choices than them."
