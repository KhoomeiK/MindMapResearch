DecidingToBeBetter,eubyyum,t3_cflnoc,1563660539.0,"At the beginning of summer, I walked to the park near my home. I forced myself to walk the main paths, circle the perimeter, check out the park benches and playground etc (only and hour or so of easy trekking).
After that, I just brought a backpack with a book, notepad, etc, testing out the different seating spots, reading a chapter or two, using no digital entertainment (except music), and giving myself a break from the overwhelming demands of society.
It was slow at first, maybe once or twice a week, sometimes I just walked to the park then came right home. But I kept the goals small and low-risk (agoraphobia/anxiety), and focused on just getting to the park.
Eventually, my trips to the park became better planned (snacks, folding chair), and on days I'm feeling better I even challenge myself to get the day's tasks and chores done before the sweet spot of the day that's best for hanging out at the park (early afternoon), and knowing I had nothing left to go home to do was liberating.

The last couple of weeks have been pretty gloomy, with overcast skies triggering my seasonal affective nature, so I've pretty much been in bed most of this month.
Well, the weather finally cleared up a couple of days ago, and today I managed to make it to the park.

Not only did it allow for language and written communication (and eventually books and internet), but also imagination: the ability to exist in a state of mind that is not the physical present.
And with the safety buffer that is modern society, we don't have to unplug from our thought-reality every two minutes to look around for predators (or food)

Now that we have the ability to pack incredible amounts of information into simply rearranging alphabetic runes almost ensures we would evolve a larger processor center for it (frontal cortext).

The last nail in the coffin of human ""looking up"" behavior patterns is when language communication became instant. Now nobody has a reason to look up from their screens. Not even for survival reasons, save the vague promise of physical health in the distant, and almost irrelevant future when everything is happening at hyperspeed.

Most importantly, we're talking about *your* future friendships. So it always comes down to how being around someone makes *you* feel.
If they consistently make you feel bad, especially if they are aware that they're doing it, then they probably aren't an ideal match.
