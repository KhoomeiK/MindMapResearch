I'm a bootcamp grad and I came out of the program knowing little more than I did when I went in.  This was in spite of putting in ~80 hours a week for twelve weeks, and only taking two days of near the end of the program because I was so emotionally crippled I kept retreating into a stairwell to sob the pressure out.  Left the program with far less confidence than I had going in, and got little real support from the school in how to actually find a job.  I've since held several positions but the bootcamp didn't get me there, and if anything it was a detriment.

Now I can forgive JS because it was a language that was developed over a couple of weeks by one person and no one ever thought it would blow up the way it has.  And it has to support multiple paradigms, including two completely different approaches to object orientation, and people want the tools to support their preferred approaches.  Ruby isn't like that.

First off, what kind of coding do you want to do?  There is a huge range of things you can do as a programmer from building mobile apps and websites to heavy duty data crunching to coding drivers and it goes on like this.  Now as a general rule, stuff which tends towards building computer models or device drivers is going to require more formal education.  I know a guy who models weather patterns at a government lab but he also has a BS in computer science and a PhD in atmospheric studies.  His day to day involves writing programs that process data points by the trillion and churn out predictions of how bad the climate will be in a hundred years, and if he spent a hundred years explaining them to me I probably still wouldn't get it.

But, that's just one small, specific kind of programming.  Odds are you want to build applications for normal people to use and leave the low level/heavy science stuff to others.  That's a lot easier to get into.  For starters you need to learn some basics, and the best place for that is probably still codecademy.com.  Their free courses will teach you some ins and outs of code in general, how the web works and how you can make pretty websites that respond to user input.  Do their courses on HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Ruby for start.  If you find yourself getting into what you're learning there try some basic coding challenges, sites like Leetcode are good for that.  It's a good way to start ""thinking like a coder,"" helps to reinforce your lessons and is good interview practice.  If you want to build websites then check out freecodecamp.com, they do a ton of stuff in JavaScript and you'll learn lots of nifty HTML/CSS stuff also.  (Don't worry if you don't know what all those things are yet, that's why you're learning them.)  At this point I suggest that everyone trying to get a go web programming do www.railstutorial.org/book which will walk you step by step through how to build a blog in Ruby on Rails, and will introduce concepts like testing and source control.  Finally start building things.  Build a video game in JavaScript, build a web application that rates movies, build anything you like and start branching out into new tools.  By this point you should have a solid grasp of the basics and ideas of how to move forward.  One last tip, early on create an account at Stack Overflow.  Spend time reading how people do questions and answers there, when you get stuck ask questions (writing questions on Stack Overflow is a skill into itself) and embrace the community.

This is not a quick process.  Depending on how much time you have to spend it may take you years to get to the point where you can get an actual job in the profession.  And along the way you may find that a different kind of coding is for you, or that you're not a huge fan of it overall.  But with persistence and patience you can learn how to do it, learn to do it well and make the jump into a better place than you are now."

My LinkedIn and resume are up to date, highlight my years of experience in development and with various technologies and important contributions at the companies I've worked for.  My CV also includes the job I had previous to learning programming which was an eight year stint working customer service and tech support for a major wireless company, highlighting the fact that I was promoted to tech support faster than anyone in the companies history.  I keep this in there to showcase my ability to communicate, especially my ability to translate tech jargon to laypersons and back again.  I also have a website up (linked to on my social media and resume) which showcases numerous personal projects I've worked on with links to the deployed apps on Heroku and the source on Github, as well as a Ruby gem I wrote and a WordPress site for which I built the template from scratch for a freelance client a few years back.  Since I've done little freelance and most of the rest of my work has been collaborative work within larger companies I don't really know how I can showcase that on my site but it's detailed in my LinkedIn and resume.

In interviews themselves I have ready answers to common questions, especially those about my previous roles, background, challenges and skills.  As a rule I try to find out as much about the process as I can, asking the person I'm speaking with if it will be more culture or tech focused, and also if there is anything I should come ready to respond to.  I also spend some time researching the company, it's products and history, and also look up any interviewers on LinkedIn to find out as much as I can about their background and skills.  During the interview I remain positive and excited (which is easy, I love writing code and discussing the craft) and try to direct the conversation in the direction of my strengths.  I generally end the conversation by thanking the interviewer, and telling them I'd like to connect with them on LinkedIn to maintain contact even if I'm not selected for the role.

I'm not saying that you're wrong, and I'm aware that my search process could be improved but I'm at a loss for how to do so.

I've made it to a final round with two places I've applied to, one rejected and the other put a COVID-19 hiring freeze in place just after I interviewed.  Maybe it's different in the market you're in but where I'm at the job hunt is nearly as difficult for me now as it was when I was first breaking into this industry."
cscareerquestions,fp6brcc,t3_gbe19z,1588349612.0,"Bootcamp grade here, Dev Bootcamp 2014.

There's what the bootcamps tell you post graduation job hunting will be like, and then there's reality.  When I was going though the program we were told to expect lots of interest from employers, that we'd get a lot of interviews and that we shouldn't actually take a job until we had two or three offers to pick from.  And honestly, some people I went through the program did have that experience but a lot of us (myself included) sure as hell didn't.  I've held several positions since I completed that bootcamp but do you want to know how long it took me to get an actual, honest to goodness full stack development role?  Five years.  And I consider myself lucky.

Now I know that this probably isn't what you want to hear but you deserve to know the truth, and the truth is that bootcamps aren't a very good road to breaking into the software development industry.  They teach surface level skills without a lot of understanding, tend to fly through important subjects like data structures and databases and don't impart a very good understanding of just how vast a field software really is.  On top of that, bootcamps are now insanely common, and are churning out tons of essentially homogeneous ""junior developers"" into a flooded market.  I've seen plenty of job postings that flat out say ""don't bother"" if all you have is a bootcamp, I've heard co-workers complain about the sheer number of resumes they get that only list bootcamps on them.  I'm sorry to have to speak so plainly, but it's best to get the bad news out of the way.

Now the good news.  You can make it into this industry, just as you're finding it will be a hell of a lot harder than the front page of your bootcamp made it seem.  The key is raw persistence on two fronts.  The first is on reaching out to other companies any way you can, targeting places where you think you have the best chance of getting in the door and doing whatever it takes to get a fair shake.  Sadly in person networking is not an option right now, but when it is take advantage of it and keep applying regardless in the meantime.  It's frustrating, believe me, I'm job hunting right now and it's difficult for me even with some good experience on my CV.  The hiring process for software engineers is broken all to hell, many companies are so paranoid of making a bad hiring choice that they do everything they can to not hire anyone at all.  Even senior developers find their resume round filed when a keyword system hits delete because somebody only has five years of Java instead of seven.  So keep at it and remember that it's not you that's broken, it's the system.  The process for bringing in new software developers just plain sucks, and never more so when you're just starting out.

I mentioned persistence on two fronts.  The second is personal, and it's all you.  Keep improving yourself.  A big part of this is your technical skills obviously, and you're doing that.  Personal projects, LC, all that you're doing, keep it up and not get discouraged.  In particular try to study the things that bootcamps tend to ignore like data structures, algorithm design, Big-O and database theory.  I read a book on design patterns a while back, and then created a Github repo with implementations of all those patterns in several different languages.  This kind of practice will make you more likely to stand out and just plain better at the craft.  But don't just focus on technical stuff, work on soft skills too.  Read books on networking, communication and the other aspects that go into working as part of a team.  And don't forget to take care of yourself.  Get good rest, get exercise, mediate, take your meds, whatever you have to do.  This is a marathon.  I don't have numbers but I'd be willing to bet that at least half of the people who graduate bootcamps give up sooner or later because they can't get in the door.  I am where I am because I kept calling people and didn't give up.  You need that kind of persistence and you won't be able to do it if you let yourself burn out and crash.

Again, I'm sorry that I don't have a rosier picture for you.  Post bootcamp job hunting is lousy under the best of circumstances, and we're far from that now.  It may take you a long time to get where you want to be, hopefully not as long as it did me, but you should prepare yourself for a long road.  Ultimately, success depends on having the strength to keep going so that when the right opportunity presents itself you'll be there to take advantage of it.  So don't get down on yourself, keep going and remember that we're all here rooting for you."

I'm an established software developer with several years of experience and I don't contact people unless I think I can help solve their problems and that's what I'm presenting myself as.  If I could do it face to face I'd be out there every night but I can't right now so I'm working with the tools I have.  I don't message recruiters because recruiters come to me but I'm going to be more proactive than just hoping they have something good.

cscareerquestions,foyyx2m,t3_ga8ys8,1588181750.0,"Very few bootcamps fall into the category of the good ones in my opinion.  I attended Dev Bootcamp back in 2014 which was one of the good ones by reputation but it did essentially nothing for me and if anything set me back.  I have made it into the industry but the road has been very rocky and I've gone for over half a year unemployed at times.

As a result, I'm very much against bootcamps at this point.  Understand that when I did it they were sending out a couple of thousand graduates every year.  The numbers are much, much higher now and you'll be competing with a much larger group for basically the same pool of open jobs.  They promise a set path into the industry but they deliver on that promise far too inconsistently.  They also promise quality, individualized education in programming but again they fail to do that with any reliability.  Bootcamps are a five figure gamble that require you to walk away from whatever you're doing at the time and don't provide a good learning environment for everyone.

If you want to do formal education you should consider something like a CS masters degree, or an online bachelors program like Western Governors University.  Or you can go the fully self taught route, there are endless resources online that can teach you pretty much everything, and great communities that can answer questions.  For context, there were times at Dev Bootcamp that I'd get stuck, and I'd get a faster answer to my question by posting to Stack Overflow than I would by asking an instructor and Stack Overflow didn't charge me eleven thousand dollars.  These options are slower, but you'll learn more deeply, you'll have better credentials than a bootcamp can offer and you'll not have to go all in on a new career when we're on the cusp of another depression.

That's my perspective, I'm always available if you would like to hear more."

Personally I think it's pretty shitty when a person tries to force you to speak in meetings.  It's hard to know what to say and no one wants to open their mouth and come off like an idiot.  Better to remain silent and be thought a fool is something I've found a lot of wisdom in.  I'm like you, I have no problem speaking up in smaller groups or situations where I'm directly involved because I know more about what is going on and if I do say something stupid fewer people will hear it.

But, some places are going to push you anyway.  That's unfortunate but adapt or die.  There are things that you can do, pre-meeting prep is a good idea, as is trying to take notes and review what is discussed so you can learn for the next time.

But do you want to know what really helped me?  Drugs.  Specifically Adderall.  Shortly before leaving my last job I got an ADHD diagnosis and a prescription.  I've always had a hard time participating in meetings because I've always had a hard time following along in meetings.  But once I started on the meds I was able to focus and respond better in real time.

I'm not saying you have ADHD.  Only a doctor can say that, and from your description it sounds like you might have something like social anxiety.  Which is treatable.  So the take away is that if it's really that bad for you then you should see a doctor and get an assessment.  There's zero shame in it and getting checked out can give you some insights on how to solve the problem.

Hopefully some day we'll live in a world where more companies are understanding that different people have different communication styles, but we're not there yet.  Meantime you're doing the right thing by looking for guidance, keep at it and you'll find something that works sooner or later."

Toxicity starts at the top, and if it's there, it will infect the rest of the team.  Over time the best players get sick of the BS and leave, and everyone else just suffers."
