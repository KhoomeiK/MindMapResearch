My personal experience as IBS-A with going vegan was that I had the worst digestion of my life (even though I really wanted it to work for me). I tend to prefer plant foods over animal foods in taste. Unfortunately, if I eat vegan I'll have gas and diarrhea endlessly, basically.

The diet that ""works"" for me is a low-FODMAP diet which is lower in carbohydrates just by the nature of most plant foods giving me diarrhea/constipation and gas. I don't have an issue with dairy products, but I do have issues with everything else that is considered high-FODMAP, especially onion, garlic, wheat, and fructose. Insoluble fiber (despite it not being a FODMAP) also gives me diarrhea. I have problems with gelatin, vinegar, and artificial sweeteners (all kinds) as well, which seems to trend with the fact that they are not digested like insoluble fiber, which also gives me issues.

I have been on both antibiotics and probiotics in my life several times, with no real change in my gut, and unfortunately plants seem to be the most likely thing to ruin my digestion.
