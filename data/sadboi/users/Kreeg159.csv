Your dad is going to push the boundary more and more. He will make you think this is all okay, and he will control you. You shouldn't let anyone just put hands on you like that unless you let them. You obviously are bothered by him doing it, and you've expressed it. If he doesn't stop, I would tell your school and local authorities/CPS. A simple talk may not be enough. This is a terrible habit of his.

worldpolitics,fl5tbb9,t3_fmeeu0,1584845162.0,"   I remember being a janitor after high school at a local mall, and I loved it. However, it was minimum wage, and at times I thought I deserved it for picking such a ""bad"" job. I fought with this mentality for the 9 months there, wondering if I should ask for a raise 6 months in since it seemed like I was doing better off than the other janitors at the, time in terms of keeping things clean. But I never did. 

   I left for a better job else where because I wanted better pay, and I have an office job now 2 years later. I get a chill environment, and don't have to do grunt work. It's better but only because the pay is more. i realize now more than ever that yeah, I should have asked for a raise, and any others who are currently doing the job, ask for a raise, y'all deserve much fuckin better. Thank you."

If you need help, i would tune in to Heartsupport via www.twitch.tv/heartsupport
Its a stream/podcast that talks about depression/anxiety and other issues. Its helpful to know that there are people who suffer with you, and sorta unite to make sure others don't feel lost.

AskMen,fg5izxq,t3_ewnuxd,1580528778.0,"I could not speak up immediately, I was too young to understand. I spoke up years later in HS to my mother. She seemed to just not care, I had just told her I was molested by a family member when I was a child. And she immediately asks not to tell my grandmother or anyone else. 

I left a few years when I turned 18 ASAP.

How my mother handled that . It .. Really just broke me in a way that I still haven't healed from. I didn't cry or breakdown, I kinda just went on with the day and haven't thought harder on it since. Its ruined me in a way that is hard to put in few words. I don't speak to my mother anymore.

Part of me wants to see justice. Part of me feels it may destroy my family. Part of me laughs at that thought. Part of me doesn't want to hurt them. 

In hindsight, I should have gotten as much info on the pedo to report them and turn them in. I regret not thinking it, or doing it. 

Its not as simple as calling the cops, I would assume. Call your state's Child Protection Services if you've been molested, apparently each state has their own number/website. I trusted my family and it ruined me. Don't trust your own family members. I should have looked for legal help."

I've thought it more since the mueller report came out, why do we have a president who won by cheating, why did it take so long for the government to DO SOMETHING? Trump is not our president, he shouldn't even be in any sort of position of power at this point. An illegitimate win means an illegitimate president.
