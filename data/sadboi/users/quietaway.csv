ptsd,fqoxul3,t3_gk3ag2,1589528211.0,"I‚Äôm so sorry about what you went through. Never compare yourself to others, especially with mental health. Everyone is different. We all grew up in different households, with different families, and with nuanced brain wirings. Your struggles are valid. If we all played the ‚Äúothers have it worse‚Äù game, we would all be glad to be alive. You‚Äôre a survivor, and I admire your strength in writing this, as it is never easy, even if you‚Äôre trying to be as vague as possible. 

I strongly recommend reaching out to a hotline, depending on where you live. You can talk to someone for free over phone or text or online chat in the US although I‚Äôm not sure where you are. I hope you can find a therapist soon and recover! There are also DBT workbooks for ptsd you find them helpful. I‚Äôm rooting for you ‚ù§Ô∏è"

You‚Äôre finding ways to cope and even process those memories, which is a huge step. I wish you the best in your recovery ‚ù§Ô∏è"

There's no AC, but you really only miss it for the first month or so before it cools down for the fall. I did a special interest thing there (it used to be called ""poverty and affluence"" but now I think it's something with inequality and  justice?) and it definitely helped to make friends even though I wasn't looking into a career in that area. When I applied, I just had to fill out a google form and write a couple quick sentences, super easy. You take a different WTE class that's more focused on that subject and there are opportunities to go out and volunteer and meet more people (the professor (Ger) is super nice, too). I met most of my NYU friends through that group. (I don't know too much about the other halls, but the other comments do a good job at describing them! I hope my experience gives some kind of advice)"
lgbt,fqkookc,t3_gjcj8v,1589432180.0,"As much as I wish I could show people ""right"" from ""wrong,"" no one has ever been able to change my beliefs, so I don't really expect myself to change others'. Sometimes it's honestly not worth your time, especially if it's a quick interaction with someone who you will never see again. 

I think the first thing is to listen to the other person, even if they are outright 100% wrong and terrible. Why? Imagine someone just telling you what to do without giving you the chance to speak your mind. You wouldn't want to listen to them *at all*, right? But if they listen to you, then maybe you wouldn't mind at least listening to what the other person is telling you. You don't have to agree with them at all and immediately do a 180 flip, but at least acknowledge where *they're* coming from. Also, here's something I learned in DBT. Just say what *you* think, not say why the other person is wrong. What's important is sharing your own ideas without putting the other person down. That way, there is less of a chance of going into arguments and just getting mad and not listening to each other. That being said, if you do want to take on the task of changing an intolerant person, listen to them first. That way, once they run out of things to say, you can tell them what you want and they'll at least hear you out and not THEY'RE right and you're not. 

Not a satisfying answer, I know, but from growing up as a liberal queer female in a conservative US county that had been voting red for over 90 years, this is what I've learned and what has been effective to show at least some results. <3"

mentalhealth,fdpy248,t3_emjupf,1578645429.0,"I‚Äôm an alcoholic and tbh I have to admit I was addicted to weed too (it‚Äôs possible!). It wasn‚Äôt until I was approved to go back to school after a leave of absence where I realized that I needed to get my shit together if I wanted to stay there. This was my dream school too so the stakes were even higher. My first month back I was smoking every day because it helped with my stress and my constant nausea (separate issue), but one day I broke down because while studying I realized I couldn‚Äôt read or focus on anything . I love to read and that just broke my heart. 

I‚Äôm bipolar and have traits of borderline and ptsd and anxiety, so of course I was allowed to go back to school on the condition of continuing psychiatric treatment. I was assigned a counselor, who is amazing, and we spoke about different options because the school was out-of-network with my insurance. Then she told me about this substance abuse program that doubled with psychiatric treatment that luckily my insurance covered. Even at first when I started I was skeptical of being an alcoholic and falling victim to addiction. I didn‚Äôt really believe I was until in group therapy I heard people talk about situations that sounded identical to my own experiences. I also heard how things felt better when they stopped smoking weed and from there I stopped using. I gotta admit it was ducking hard for the first few weeks and there were close calls, but I‚Äôm proud to say I‚Äôm 88 days sober and the sleep is so much better, my anxiety has drastically improved, and my mind is clearer. I just finished my first semester back and I passed all of my classes for the first time ever. I‚Äôm also just starting to get better at reading and it‚Äôs just.. great. 

Sorry about the long story.. that was completely unwarranted üòÖ I thought sharing my experience might serve as support and just my way of letting you know you‚Äôre not alone. I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre getting started and that if you‚Äôre doubting yourself, remember there are so many great things lying ahead of you on the road to sobriety."

If in the first couple weeks you find it to be overwhelming, you can still change courses before the deadline. 

Also, you don‚Äôt have to choose between premed and CS. It‚Äôs possible to do both, since there is no specific ‚Äúpremed‚Äù major although a lot of premeds decide to do bio as their major. You can do premed with just about any major as long as you plan accordingly :)"

AskReddit,f5ttu8o,t3_dp56ya,1572464229.0,"My junior year was my first year at this dual enrollment program (taking college courses instead of high school courses, but I still needed to take high school English and U.S. History).  Since the class was so small, the school had this policy that to get honor's credit for the course, you had to get 97%+ in the class. I stressed and pushed myself hard in all of my classes to ensure that. Outside of school, however, there was more that I was stressed about. I was in charge of cleaning the house and cooking since my mom was out of state for medical school. I wanted to get into a good school. My relationship with my dad became strained after he called me a whore after finding a pregnancy test in my bag and a fucking bitch when he caught me holding hands with someone. I was in 5 different orchestras because I wanted to be out of the house whenever I could and because I couldn't get private lessons on my own. I turned to drinking and it got to the point where I would get to class drunk. Yeah, I'm pretty sure she noticed, because the following semester she changed the policy so that you would need to do a book report or project or something to get the honors credit. I met up with her after class one day and proposed to do a report on the Gulag Archipelago (Solzhenitsyn), but she turned it down because she had an other idea in mind.

&#x200B;

Apparently she could see how many times I checked my grades on the online system that first semester. I looked up my grades 450 times just in those three months. She said I shouldn't be so hard on myself, so instead of the book report, she set up a goal so that I only check my grades 5 times a week. If I kept that up, I would get my honors credit. She knew I loved music. She said instead of stressing over perfection I should embrace my passion and let myself relax. She was confident I will do well in class without all of that stress anyways. By the end of that school year, I got to perform at Carnegie Hall, got my first semi-professional gig as a violinist, and got this national hispanic scholar thing. (Oh, and I also got my honors credit). I moved to another state, but I took that lesson with me. I continued playing music and I made it to my top choice school with a full tuition scholarship as a music major.

&#x200B;

I will never forget her and how she taught me to not be so hard on myself and to embrace what I love. Never had a teacher like her since."
