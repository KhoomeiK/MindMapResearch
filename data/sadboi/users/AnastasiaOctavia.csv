Yeah it's not that bad, but it was a noticeable drop. I've been losing 3 to 10 pounds a week average of probably 4 or 5. Sip dropping to one a week was a little shocking.

Going slower definitely helps with lose skin. With as fast as I'm losing tho I've had to switch to something else to help.  Which fit me has been wights. My arms were starting to get wings and my boobs were getting really saggy. So I really kicked up my weight lifting. I've always been taught that women shouldn't lift more than like 10 to 15 pounds 20 if necessary because it's unattractive and unladylike. I've always had a fear of being too masculine because of this.  But as I was losing I had to make a choice.  Be saggy with a soft ""feminine"" body or get over my fear and try to keep it ""toight"" I chose tight and got my hubby helping me lift well like a dude. 🤣

EatingDisorders,fqasrrr,t1_fqa6vkz,1589224648.0,"I would suggest doing this over the phone because it will be easier for you to control the pace of things.  I would suggest calling her and starting off by saying that you have something you need to talk about and that you need to her listen without interrupting. If she can't handle that, tell her you'll hang up on her.  Then go on to tell her that you're in recovery and that you need to think about your health. Because of this you can't talk about your weight or diet with her anymore.  I'm assuming she'll be crying or screaming or both at this point.  Hang up, text her you'll call later once she's had time to calm down and then turn off your phone. Wait a day then try calling her again.  

Or you could do everything through text. That is probably what I would do but I hate talking on the phone and being yelled at. Sadly though you might have to cut her out for a while for her to get that your serious and decide if she wants to change or not."

If you can't handle that it's entirely 100% your problem and is on you 100% to fix yourself. Get yourself into therapy and learn how to handle emotions better. Learn how to think about others and most importantly learn to respect your daughter as a person and see that she's handling herself very maturely.

I'm not a body builder but I would think cutting down on carbs and fat a little (maybe idk what you're eating) and adding fat burning workouts (running, jump rope, box jumps, boxing etc) into your daily routine would be helpful.  Personally I'm a big fan of warning up then doing a cardio then a set of weights then cardio then the weights mixed in with some things like set ups and pushups mixed in.  Keeps your heart rate up and helps the fat go away while still toning and strengthening your muscle. 

Also please don't forget stretching."

WeightLossAdvice,fm8jo36,t1_fm8f5xt,1585850595.0,"That's good to know, thank you!"
raisedbynarcissists,fm84ijw,t3_ftninj,1585842658.0,"Not sure what you mean about maybe not the horse. We are getting two of them. For our homestead. 

That aside the just accepting that I'm happy is actually pretty good advice. Thank you"
raisedbynarcissists,fm81k0q,t1_fm80zf2,1585841042.0,"I don't know why I can't be happy. I feel like I don't deserve it. Like I asked my so yesterday what I did to ever deserve so much happiness. XD

I'm sorry you lost your sister. 


I'm trying but is not always easy"
raisedbynarcissists,fm80bie,t1_fm7zohj,1585840358.0,They really do and then when something good did happen as a kid they came in and would ruin it. I think gale actually enjoyed making me cry or feel bad. Gave her some sort of control high or something.  I just want it to go away. I don't want to feel bad for having a good life.
WeightLossAdvice,fm7qvl5,t1_fm7puo1,1585834784.0,"Well... definitely count calories and exercise. I always eat my 1200 a day and if I'm exercising a lot I'll eat more to make up the difference. 

I do medium to light resistance training mixed on with cardio 5× a week

Cut down on carbs but didn't cut them out entirely. Trying to focus on high protein foods and staying away from anything that's low fat or no fat because they usually have higher sodium levels. 

Mostly I've just been working out 2 to 3 hours a day. I'll put on the biggest loser (I'm fully aware they aren't the authority on losing weight and that something like 80% of there contestants gained their weight back. I just use it as motivation. I hate the gym better I always feel judged and the show helps me feel like I've got workout buddies) and workout in my living room. I've got free weights and other equipment that is house friendly and just try to have fun with it. 

I also realize that most people can't workout that much 5 times a week and I'm actually doing it on purpose because in the next few months I'll be running a farm so I'm trying to condition myself for that as best I can living in the burbs. Hopefully this helps, but unfortunately I don't really have tips."
Horses,fm7o31o,t1_fm7nwd8,1585832824.0,"That's a good idea! Thank you. 

I planned on it. I want to jump recreationally and I'm gonna need someone to teach me and my horse."
Horses,fm7np6u,t1_fm7le08,1585832538.0,"Thanks for taking the time for your response. 

My big question after all that tho is: what do I do if I don't have anyone to come with me? My grandparents who had horses and taught me what I do know are both dead and I was the only one in the family that wanted to do anything with them."
WeightLossAdvice,fm7mu8u,t1_fm7mg08,1585831882.0,Thank you!
Horses,fm7g7n8,t1_fm7fsui,1585825836.0,"My grandmother owned horses and she taught me the basics of horse care, feeding brushing, how to trim hooves etc. She also taught me how to ride at a trot. Unfortunately I didn't get to learn how to gallop. Which is why I'm talking to a couple places to get lessons set up. 

As for what style, I'm thinking western for trail and work and then an English jumping for in the ring since I want to jump.  

Did you have a professional fit the saddles for your horses since that was what you first recommended?

Thanks for the tips"
funny,fm3yo2e,t3_fswzyz,1585741591.0,Gross creepy old man.
AmItheAsshole,fltz1gk,t1_fltv86j,1585491325.0,"Yeah, pretty much.  Even if they do pray they gossip before hand, to ""know who to pray for"" then again after they pray because they are ""worried""."
AmItheAsshole,fltyraq,t1_fltthhs,1585491116.0,That was the type I was and they are the worst! They felt the exact same way and every other religion was a cult except Catholicism which was witchcraft. 🤣
AmItheAsshole,flto8zv,t3_fr1ykr,1585481314.0,"NTA, but coming from what sounds to be a similar faith (I was raised Pentecostal and couldn't wear makeup, pants, shorts, jewelry of any kind including wedding bands, couldn't have short hair etc) be prepared for the ""witnessing"" to really ramp up. Evangelicals seem to thrive on painting atheists in a really negative depressed way. This guy is possibly gonna see you telling him your an atheist as some sort of confirmation that he keeps seeing you guys because jeebus wants him to bring you and yougrt husband to the truth and into the ""fold"" to be saved and protected by the ""blood of jesus""."
AmItheAsshole,flnt2xa,t1_flnr14y,1585325345.0,It's basically talking to them about the love of jesus and how great the church is and telling them about miracles in your own life. It's pretty much anything and everything one could think of to get their friend or family member to start going to church with them so they can find the truth and be saved.
witchcraft,flnhc8d,t3_fpwy5s,1585318616.0,"I use a candle usually colored to match the color of the face of the Morrigan I'm looking for, pour a glass of red wine or my favorite drink, whatever I have on hand, and light some incense. I usually try to match that to her persona as well.  Then I'll invite her into my space using her name, not title. I tend to reach out to Anu the most so I'll call to the great queen the Morrigan and invite Anu to join me.  After that I'll pour out some of the liquor on the ground, and right outside a door as an offering then proceed on with why I summoned her in the first place."
AmItheAsshole,flnd7pz,t1_flnd08p,1585315936.0,If she was still alive I would totally have to do this. 🤣🤣
AmItheAsshole,fln96kc,t3_fprc2y,1585312946.0,"NTA, but I'm gonna give you a warning.  My mother was super religious and very controlling. My eldest middle brother (I'm the youngest by far.) and his wife weren't very religious yet every time we'd hop visit them mom would bring religious stuff up and try to ""witness"" to them. One time she even managed to convince me (I was like maybe 8 or 9 and didn't know any better) to try witnessing to them. After that they got super angry at her for not respecting their boundaries. They had told her not to bring it up again or she wouldn't be welcomed in their home again. Which I didn't know. After a few months and I'm sure lots of nagging and emotional abuse, my brother's anger died down and we went back to visit. Before we did mom went to our church and got all the ""elders"" (not mormon just what the old people called themselves) together pastor included and (forgive me I don't know how to word this differently) made a prayer rage. Think an old handkerchief or scrap of white cloth. They then take this rage and anoint it with holy oil and pray over it. Basically is supposed to be a beacon of protection and idk god somehow. Anyway, we drive the 2.5 hours to my brother's house and the moment she had a chance she hid the damn thing in their house. This went on for YEARS.  Every time we went to visit she had her stupid prayer rage and would hide it. One time even made me hide one in my niece's room to ""protect her from demons"". 

Cut to a few years later and I've moved in with the boyfriend I had at the time and had completely left her church. Every time she visited me I'd have to search the apartment for those rages and I found one everytime. Point of such a long rant,  she'll probably never respect your choice to be free from religion so keep on eye out for hidden ""prayers"" and ""gifts to keep you safe"""
