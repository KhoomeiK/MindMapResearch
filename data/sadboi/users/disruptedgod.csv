I had little to no background on FPS games and I got the key 4-5 days ago. The first day I would just die because I kept trying to use my abilities to kill the enemies instead of my guns. Also, figuring out the recoil patterns and what crosshair is best AND what weapons you prefer to use is hard. I think we should just give them a little break because it's okay. A lot of players are from CS:GO and other FPS and you can notice it by how many of their kills are HS... Which is WAY harder for us who don't have that experience with FPS."

Minecraft,f3ne8tt,t1_f3ltfkf,1570997376.0,as a bedrock player... thank you! it's way easier to convert a bedrock texture pack to java then from java to bedrock so i think it's easy for all those who still want to enjoy your pack!

HongKong,f2r320r,t1_f2r03w1,1570369289.0,"Nobody said I'm the holder of wisdom. I am naive. I admit that I am naive, anyone and everyone can be naive to many things. Maybe one day I will look back this and think that I am naive but right now, at this moment I feel PRETTY strongly about this!"

SuicideWatch,f1c7exw,t3_d8jmpf,1569351572.0,"life is unfair and cruel... that's a reality for ANYONE and EVERYONE. if you're not here anymore, i wish you a safe journey and that you may lead a happy life somewhere else. if you're still here, fight, keep fighting, it's gonna hurt like hell and life will keep knocking you down but keep fighting for small moment. small moments like petting a cat, those things that make all the pain go away, even if it's for a fraction of a second"
amiugly,f15fq8q,t3_d7t0rj,1569189662.0,"Depression is hell and can often give us a false perception of ourselves and the world. With that said. You're not ugly at all, if you're ugly I wouldn't even dare to call myself ugly as it would be an offense I would have to reduce myself to a small single atom made of the ugliest piece of skin of my body."
apolloapp,f10gry9,t3_d7iop7,1569112314.0,\*fingers crossed\* I really hope that I can win it so that with Uni coming I'll have an easy non-buggy way to communicate with family!!
amiugly,f0x6wgr,t3_d6jy41,1569023499.0,You're very good looking but I think that you're single because I'M JUST ASSUMING that you have some type of androgenous qualities
amiugly,f0x6rtl,t3_d6z1rl,1569023390.0,"Brutally honest. You're not ugly, you don't look creepy at all you just look like you're sad and REALLY unconfident. The photos are definitely no appealing because you don't seem to know how to take nice picture and not a lot of people do actually! Your nose is not big at all... I don't know who has ever told you but that's a lie because if your nose is big I have the Eiffel Tower on my face"
