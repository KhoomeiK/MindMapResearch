Also, going to check out that sub. I have always been aware that Native Americans are still around, but their perspectives can be harder to find than more dominant/mainstream ones. I really would like to find more spaces to listen to indigenous voices. Do you have any other recommendations?

Ok last thing. Recently, the podcasts I listen to have started interviewing some native women doing really cool work. Just putting these here so people can check them out.

Would you consider full names like Raymond and Louis to go with them? Other names that seem to go with those themes: Forrest, Jonah, Judah, or Graham. Hope this helps!"
namenerds,fqpkyc5,t3_gk5s68,1589548814.0,"I think Grace and Hailey are both nice names! They come off to me as pretty and familiar. Here are a few other names that might also be your style: Leah, Cora, Ruth, Ellie, Elsie, Elaine, Claire, Mercy, Hannah, Mary, Michelle, and Joy. I feel like these are all nice, simple, familiar girl‚Äôs names that you can make your own.

I don‚Äôt have experience changing my name, so the rest here is just my opinion. If you dislike your name so much that it just brings up bad memories/thoughts, people who respect you should call you by your new name. If you are ok with being called your old name, then maybe it is a good idea to keep it as a middle name. Hope this helps!"
namenerds,fqpge2w,t3_gj6988,1589545720.0,"Prim sounds super cute, makes me think of ‚Äúprim and proper.‚Äù I think Primrose sounds beautiful and has kind of a romantic vibe to it. It is a bit unique perhaps and does have the association with Hunger Games; I don‚Äôt think either of these things is necessarily bad, but maybe it‚Äôs just not your style. 

My favorite Prim name is Prima. Makes me think of a prima ballerina, someone pretty and graceful.  It‚Äôs short and sweet, easy to pronounce and spell. Yes, prima does mean cousin in Spanish, but it‚Äôs not something negative. As someone who speaks Spanish, prima just gives me vibes of family and closeness. Not at all like if you were to name your kid Rana (frog) or Mala (bad). Traditionally, Prima is a name you would give your firstborn. 

Hope this helps!"

Baron reminds me of Baron Trump :/

What about Abram?‚Äîif you wanted Abe to be a nickname it would work! 

I also noticed the common -n ending. Some more of those names: Dawson, Carson, Rowan, Weston, Landon, Solomon, and Simon.
