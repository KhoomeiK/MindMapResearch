This one particular night though, we fell asleep with the blindfold and bondage on. I woke up a couple of hours later, restricted and unable to see. Full blown panic attack. He soothed and talked to me until I was calm enough for him to touch me to take the bondage stuff off. 

For me, I think it brought back flashbacks of trauma from a previously abusive relationship. We make sure to always take the blindfold of good off now before falling asleep."

unpopularopinion,fn8izt6,t3_g00r9m,1586742741.0,"I agree to an extent. That being said, I try not to look at my kids’ messages until they give me a reason to. Like, when my oldest son was 12, he got his first cellphone. 

Both kids, him and his younger brother, were getting ready to go spend a month at their dad’s house, who lives 8 hours away. We did the stranger danger talk, talked about safety, not giving personal information to strangers, the works. A couple weeks later, Igor an email from an adult fetish site, saying “so and so has responded to your message”. I clicked out of curiosity. Apparently my son had joined an adult baby diaper lover site, couldn’t remember his email address I had set up for him, so he used mine. He had posted a message to a strange man, basically saying “would you like to come live with me? My name is FULL NAME and my address is FULL ADDRESS”. It turned into a fiasco, as he couldn’t remember the password he had set for the site, so I spent a week arguing with the administrator of the fetish site, explaining that the account was fraudulent, post belonged to a minor, and contained identifying information. It took an entire week for them to remove the post and close his account. He lost the privilege of having a cell phone for another two years. 

When I decided to try again, we had the same talk, he understood where he had messed up before, and was given another phone with service. I checked his phone history a month later and he had created another account. Lost the phone for 3 months, and we tried again. That’s been 2 years now. Either he has learned not to lie about his age and give personal information to strangers, or he has gotten better about hiding it. 

I still checked his phone sporadically the first year or so, every few months, but haven’t in a long time. He’s grown up and shown he can be more responsible."

It’d be fine until I bent over to do something, then stood up, and the heavy chain and lock would smack down hard on my chest and set off a panic attack. We discussed it at length and he chose a different one. This one was  more of a play collar, very obvious, not discreet at all. Plus you had to have a special tool to take off and on. Working with elderly patients all day, I can’t have something locked around my neck that screams sex slave. He was upset that I “didn’t like it” but after hearing my reasoning, we worked together and found something affordable that was also discreet.

AskWomen,fi8zidx,t3_f6ugtu,1582251996.0,"I worked for a company with 7 different offices. However, there were a couple mother daughter chains in the management part, and the daughter would tattle and the mother would cut your hours. My bf and I bought a house an hour and a half away from the office I was working in, set up the transfer to that office in 2 months, everything was good. 

A month before the move, the daughter called and asked if I could work Thanksgiving. The policy was each prn position had to work one holiday a year, and I had already covered Memorial Day. We had plans to spend the day with bf’s family, it was less than a week away. I apologized and said I had plans already. She first tried telling me I had to, I countered that pointing out I had already covered my holiday for the year. She responded, “Alright, I’ll let mom know and we will figure something out”. The very next week my hours went down from 40 a week to 8. For 3 weeks. They just kept saying “sorry, our census is low right now”. I went ahead and interviewed with a different company, got a job paying close to $6 an hour more, and set up to start the week after our move. The same daughter/scheduler called me and asked if I could cover Christmas Eve, Christmas Day and the weekend after, on my own. I said sure, and my hours started picking up. Three days before Christmas Eve, the company had their annual Christmas party. I went, ate my free steak, drank my alcohol, claimed my yearly bonus of a Walmart gift card for $250. Smiled and interacted with everyone. At 8 am the next morning, I walked into corporate, talked the mother of the pair, one of the big bosses, turned in my stuff and quit. Since my contract had already expired during the 3 weeks they were punishing me for standing up for myself, there was nothing they could do. We moved 3 months ago, and I’m living my new job. Much less cattiness and pettiness. And the schedules for on call and holidays are made up 3 months in advance.

RelationshipAdviceNow,fgfdkf6,t3_ey1679,1580735464.0,"I’ve been where you’re at, and let me tell you the flip side. My boyfriend and I dated nearly a year. We were talking about moving in together, looking at houses, checking out different school districts for my kids, etc. We lived 70 miles apart, and he would come over after work Friday nights and stay until Monday morning. I’d drive to him Wednesday’s. 

One Friday night, he texted me that he was on the way, that he loved me. When he got here, he told me it was just too much, that he wasn’t ready, that it just wasn’t working. I was shocked, it came out of the blue. In a 3 hour span, he went from, “I love you and can’t wait until we find a place of our own” to “This just isn’t working.”  He even said, “I’m sorry, I tend to over promise stuff”. That one statement really messed me up for a while, not trusting anything anyone said, in case they “were over promising”. 

I did everything you’ve done. Begged for another chance, drunk called him, asked if we could still be friends, every cliche in the book. He just kept saying, “I just don’t think we are a great fit”. I read all the self help articles online, tried to take up a new hobby, spent more time with family and friends, all of that. Then I decided to rebound. You’ve heard the saying, “The best way to get over someone is to get under someone else”. 

Let me tell you, it was great at first. I met a guy, explained from the jump that I was coming out of a breakup, not looking for anything serious, and he agreed. It was such a confidence booster at first. I went from the heart broken woman pining after her ex to a woman that someone found attractive and sexy. Then the rebound turned abusive, yet I stayed. Every time he would hit me or hurt me, or leave me bruised and bleeding, ignore safewords. He’d apologize, swear it would never happen again, but it always would. Yet I stayed. It took one particularly bad time for me to eventually be strong enough to leave. I felt like I didn’t even know myself anymore. 

The entire time, my ex and I were still texting, once or twice a week. I would tell him the good parts, leave out the bad, and he’d tell me about the dates he has been on. It would still cut me like a knife, but I’d hide it, then go back to my rebound and let him hurt me again. 

After I left the abusive guy, a few weeks later, I drunk called my ex, asked if we could meet up for no strings attached fun, and he agreed. Of course he did, what guy is going to turn down free sex without commitment? That one time led to several, to eventually deciding we would try again. A few months of dating until I finally told my kids we were dating again, to our one year mark again. We closed on a house together in October, and have been living together since. 

So far things are good, but I still worry constantly. I worry something in him will suddenly change over night again and he’ll find it all “too much”. I have a hard time separating my emotions from what happened, a hard time forgiving. Some part of me even kind of blames him for the rebound guy hurting me, which I know is totally irrational. 

We’ve got a good dynamic going again, we communicate better. I find myself nervous to bring up stuff that bothers me though, and still don’t feel like myself, just a shadow. I have nightly nightmares and flashbacks to some of the times the rebound guy beat me. I struggle with guilt for staying so long, even guilt for trying to move on instead of waiting for my boyfriend to come around, which is ridiculous. The panic attacks every time we have sex are improving though. 

Sorry to be so long winded. I guess take my story as a cautionary tale. Even if she came back, your relationship would never be the same. You’d constantly live in fear that something you did or said would set her off, and she’d destroy your world again. You’d eventually start to resent her for making you doubt yourself so much. Every day, as she loved you more you would be falling out of love with her more and more, then you’d be the one staying out of guilt."

Assistance,fdzekyz,t3_en99g5,1578789482.0,"I’m so sorry for your loss. I lost my dad when I was 30, and he was 57, and completely fell apart. He only had a $1000 policy from when he was a child, so it didn’t cover everything. We called the local funeral home, who transported him to their branch in a close town for cremation. Overall, it came to $2700. They accepted the $1000 and let me sign a payment plan for the rest, which I took in a few weeks later once his retirement was cashed out. A lot of places will cremate for $800 or so, you might google online near you or make some calls. One thing the funeral home talked me into was “a corrugated box for his remains”, which turned out to just be a $75 cardboard box.  It’s shameless the charges they will try to tack on because they know you are in shock. 

Once you have your mom’s ashes, y’all can plan a memorial service at a later date. We did my dad’s 3 months later, when the ground was soft. One tip I found was, if you order an urn from the funeral home or online, they can get rather expensive. We ordered 3 pet urns, one for each of us, for much much cheaper, had them engraved with his information, and we each got a few scoops, a piece of him to take with us. 

The day before he passed away, my dad had told me, “I saw this thing on Facebook where they cremate you, compress your ashes around a seed, and plant you in a special park, so you grow into a tree. Don’t waste that kind of money on me, just throw my ashes in a hole and plant a fruit tree over me. Don’t tell anyone until they’re eating the fruit, then tell them that they are biting my butt”. We all laughed, then he fell over dead from a heart attack the next day. 

3 months after his death, we held a memorial service with our friends and family in his back yard. Dug a hole, read a few bible verses, scooped some of his ashes into the urns, and buried the rest. Planted a pear tree on top of him. A month or so later, when I could afford it, I bought a couple benches to put out there by his tree. A few months later, I ordered an engraved granite tombstone marker for his burial site. It’s been nearly 5 years now, and we get 6-7 pears a year from his tree. 

The immediate response when someone dies is to start planning a big elaborate send off, but funerals are more for the living than the dead. Your mom wouldn’t have wanted you stressing and dirtying about throwing something together when your entire world just got turned upside down. 

I wish I knew something to say to help, but there’s really nothing that can ease that shocked, numbing, stabbing pain. All I can say is that time really does help. Right now, every reminder hurts, there will probably be several times you’ll reach for your phone to call her, then remember. A familiar vehicle will bring it all back. The first year is tough, because you’ll be comparing every holiday with previous ones. Try to stay busy, maybe make new traditions, and take it one day at a time. Eventually you’ll get to the point where you will be able to remember all the good times without that sharp ache in your chest, but it takes time. A read an analogy that said grief isn’t really a timeline, but more like waves. You’ll be sailing along and a wave or pain will hit you, then maybe anger about the whole situation, then sadness, and so on. 

I’m so sorry you are your siblings are going through this, especially at such a young age. If you need to vent or talk, don’t hesitate to message me. It will suck for a long time, but it WILL get easier."

I can say, “what did you do at school today?”, and get a one word response. I can ask him, “which one should I use on my raid team?” And he’ll talk so animatedly. “Use this one, because his charge attack is this, and the raid boss is weak to this, and he is number 582 in the Pokédex, and did you know his fire is 2700 degrees Fahrenheit, and I’ve been trying to shiny chain him in the let’s go game, and had caught 27 of them before I got one, and he evolved into this, and..”. It’s been so fun watching him come out of his shell. We ordered team shirts for the family last year, that he wears religiously every single community day. Lol. When I took the boys to summer visitation with their dad this year, we stopped by a Pokémon convention going on in San Antonio. He kept walking up to vendors, actually talking to strangers, asking, “do you have the card for Pokédex entry 731?”  I’d have to remind him that most of us have no clue what number he is, to give a name instead. His excitement tickled me."

survivorsofabuse,fb34gfh,t3_eb4fgg,1576464021.0,"It honestly sounds like you are doing everything you can for her, almost to the point of enabling her. 

That being said, I have a teenage son who has high functioning autism (aspergers). Over the years I’ve learned I have to be very specific in my communication with him. He doesn’t pick up on social cues or when you suggest something. If I say, “it would be nice if you’d help me unload the groceries”, it doesn’t register. If I say, “please help me carry these bags in”, he gets one bag, brings it inside, and sits down. I have to say, “Can you please carry this in, set it on the table, and come back?”  

I agree with the other posters, it sounds like time for the boundaries talk. Have her detail her version of the boundaries of her relationship with Jane, explain specifically what you meant about “ needing her emotional support” after your bad day, etc. To me, I would interpret that as meaning, “I’ve had a rough day and may need to vent later, so could you please answer my texts?”, and maybe not see the problem with visiting with Jane and talking to you at the same time. 

It sounds to me like she was interpreting the best she could, keeping you somewhat informed of her evening, and still giving you attention too. 

As far as all of the help you’re giving her, it sounds to me almost like you’re doing way too much. I’m not saying to stop but discuss that with her too. Does she actually realize all the time, effort and money you are spending to come help her? Sometimes people don’t actually stop and think about what a hardship it is on the other person. 

Only you know the specifics, but my goal with my son is to provide him the tools to work towards self sufficiency. He has trouble with handwriting, so he sees an occupational therapist to work on itand we got him a laptop to type his assignments. Trouble with spelling, we let him use spell check. Trouble with organization, we make checklists to go through. As long as you’re willing to travel and do everything for her, what’s her motivation towards self sufficiency?

I think you guys really need to have a long talk. Explain how you feel, find out how she feels. I know for me personally, after being in an abusive relationship, I’m constantly on the lookout for red flags in my current one. I’d have probably interpreted your “I need you to cancel your plans so I can vent later” as a red flag for being controlling, whether justified or not. And when I constantly say I’m tired, it’s usually because it’s easier to say that then to explain that I’m feeling depressed, stressed, a little anxious, scared to open up in case my emotions are too much and scare you off, and angry for a reason that’s perfectly ridiculous and feel silly mentioning. 

Does she have a therapist helping her?"

I know with his very first one, in second grade, his teacher was walking around the classroom handing out papers. She saw him laying on the ground, told him to get up, and noticed on her second lap around the room that he was seizing. At this point, he had no history of seizing, besides a few febrile ones as an infant. She payed the office overhead, who sent the nurse. Her office was right around the corner then, and as soon as she got there the teacher gathered up all the other kids and took them in the hall to give him privacy. I got a call from the nurse, after he was coming out if it, saying ambulance was en route, she would ride with him, where did I want them to take him. I’m a nurse also, and worked for his primary doctor at the time, so they brought him to the hospital we were connected to, dr came over with me and checked him out. He had another one during the CT, and they direct admitted him. In a scary time, while I was panicking and freaking out, the school handled it with the urgency and promptness he needed. The school nurse stayed with us at the ER for a little bit, explained what had happened, and his teacher was wonderful. Total contrast to this time."
breakingmom,f8bcgha,t1_f8b6u2u,1574433452.0,"He does have a friend in most of his classes, that’s the only way we kind of pieced together what happened. That’s a good idea, talking to them and helping them know what to do too."
breakingmom,f8b4ib2,t1_f8ava78,1574426627.0,"Yes, teacher was involved in his ARD to start middle school that was held in May, where I went over all of this. Texas passed [Sam’s Law](https://www.samslaw.org/)  recently that also mandates all school personnel have seizure training. 

I think I’m just shocked and irritated that this happened. From his very first seizure, all the way through elementary school, the school was on top of it, and I felt safe, knowing that if something came up, they would keep him safe and get him emergency treatment. 

It’s a small district, the middle school, high school and elementary on one campus, and they share a nurse. I have no complaints about her, she has taken excellent care of him, despite having to run campus to campus. It just never even crossed my mind that any of the teachers, especially after training, would see this and choose not to respond."

I can recognize when situations have a potential to set off a panic attack, and try to avoid them though. That’s not always possible, and I don’t think it’s unreasonable to ask the loved ones in your life to please try to avoid doing x around you, because it’s a trigger. 

At the same time though, you are ultimately responsible for learning coping methods and strategies to work through them. 

For instance, one of mine is being around loud screaming crowds. I can’t always avoid them, but I can try to stay away from parades, parties, big sporting events, etc"
