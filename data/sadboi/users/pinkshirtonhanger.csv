She was refusing to go to school, and acted like she absolutely hated my guts every second of the day, even though she would occasionally tell me that she didn't understand why she hated me so much. She started refusing to go to therapy, and made frequent suicidal threats. She ticked all of the boxes for someone that could benefit from wilderness and/or therapeutic boarding school, and that was the recommendation of her therapist and psychiatrist. It felt completely hopeless. 

We did end up getting her to agree to go to a short-term, voluntary residential program in our home state. She was only there for 3 weeks (insurance wouldn't cover more). She ended up really loving it, and it gave us all a little bit of a break from the patterns that had developed. Most importantly, it gave her just a tiny bit of desire to participate in treatment at home. It did not ""cure"" her or solve all of our problems by any stretch. But it was a safe place for her to be, and when she came back, she started doing therapy, and she has gradually gotten better. A year later, she still struggles (I sometimes wonder how things would be if we had sent her to a boarding school--she'd be home by now. Would she be better than she is now? I don't know).

What you can learn to control is how you act based on your emotion. Some actions are more effective than others. Some actions can help you feel better (or at least not worse)--others can lead to a situation that triggers another emotional response (""feeling like a monster"").

In this case, it's completely natural that you felt angry about your mom's comments. My advice (if you want it!) would be to let yourself feel that anger for a few moments without reacting. Try to take some deep breaths during those moments (or any other type of mindfulness practice). If the anger doesn't subside a little bit after those moments, think about taking yourself out of the situation. Just say, ""excuse me"" and walk out of the room. When you feel in control of yourself, go back and try to have a conversation with her.

Seems like a really big difference between the DBT program there (which seems to be more of a legit, hospital-like situation) and their other program which sounds like hell."
BPD,fdorupm,t3_emehjr,1578611485.0,"That is really great. I am taking a DBT class now, and I find myself drawing on it all the time."
BPD,fdorsxo,t1_fdorg1y,1578611455.0,"In my experience with teen group therapy, they all exchange their social media info within the first, like, 30 seconds, even though the therapists tell them not to!"
BPD,fdo0342,t3_em9woc,1578596350.0,It's not too late. You can feel better. What's the harm in trying?
BPD,fdnzuqc,t3_em7uk3,1578596215.0,"This is all great to hear. Congratulations and thanks for sharing. I think a DBT ""tune up"" from time to time is a good idea."
BPD,fbhwe6c,t3_edf788,1576884088.0,"You don't sounds like you're craving attention. You definitely could have suffered some trauma during that time, and BPD can also arise without any trauma.

I would talk to your mom about starting therapy again, and then I would be really open with your therapist about these symptoms. Some therapists are hesitant to diagnose BPD in minors, but they can still recommend treatment that would be effective.

You sound really smart and insightful, and I hope you get the support that you need."
BPD,fbh69rb,t3_edcsi9,1576866276.0,"Is she recommending DBT for the black and white thinking? If so, I wouldn't worry about the diagnosis, since DBT will help multiple mental health issues. Some insurance won't cover any treatment if its for BPD, so maybe you're better off."
BPD,fbe5xt5,t3_ecupqd,1576778925.0,I am extremely impressed!
BPD,fbe5ndr,t3_ecv7jr,1576778735.0,"I don't want to encourage you to smoke, but I listened to a really in-depth radio program about nicotine recently that said that people's fear of nicotine is really irrational and that it actually can be used to treat anxiety and/or depression. 

The show also reported that the recent vaping illnesses have been closely tied to THC vaping products that are manufactured oversees, and NOT nicotine products like juul."
BPD,fbe55h0,t1_fbdpl28,1576778414.0,"One skill I've learned in DBT is ""pendulating"" thoughts. It's not a skill that you use during an ""episode,"" but you basically sit for like 3 minutes and set a timer to go off every 15 seconds. Close your eyes and get comfortable. For the first 15 seconds, think of something pleasant (e.g., snuggling with a dog), and when the timer goes off, think of something unpleasant (not too horrible, but unpleasant). Each time the timer goes off, switch to the other thought. This helps lay down the neural pathways for your brain to be able to switch out of rumination/obsessive thoughts."
troubledteens,fbc3q49,t3_ecjrc9,1576714919.0,"I would focus on getting the help you need for yourself, rather than punishing her (she certainly sounds like she deserves it). Incidentally, getting yourself help will strengthen your legal case if you end up bringing one. The fact that you needed therapy in order to recover is evidence of the harm she did."
BPD,fbc1116,t1_fbbwqyt,1576713043.0,"When I learned more about BPD traits (which are really common among teenagers), and the importance of validation, it made things much easier for me--not just for my family member who has those traits. So it would be in your mom's own self-interest to understand more. I used to be completely mystified by some of the BPD behaviors, but understanding how the BPD brain works has made things much easier. 

One small example: I used to think my family member was wallowing in self-pity for no reason, and I'd try to point out all of the ways in which she is lucky or privileged. This just made her feel worse--like I wasn't hearing her explain how miserable she felt, and she would just escalate her behavior in order show me how she was feeling inside. Saying something as simple as ""I can see that you feel awful,"" without trying to problem solve or rationalize her out of it is SO much better, for her and for me."
BPD,fbb38x7,t1_fbaapcs,1576692374.0,"I wonder if your therapist could hold a session with you and your parents where she helps you communicate with them, and helps them understand how their reactions are not helpful."
BPD,fb93squ,t1_fb8yeiu,1576628639.0,"That's a lot of pressure! But you seem like an incredibly strong person, with a good plan to get through it. Even if it doesn't go perfectly, you'll get through it. 

Also, I know that employers can be assholes, but if I'm reading your post right, you only missed one day of work, you texted your supervisors that you were sick, and you have a doctor's note? I don't think they'll reprimand you."
