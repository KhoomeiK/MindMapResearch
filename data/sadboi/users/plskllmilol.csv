I recently moved in with him and for a while I felt off- like I couldn‚Äôt hear my thoughts or feel my true emotions for weeks. I was in a low place and had no idea why. I finally realized that it‚Äôs because I never felt alone and I need to be alone to feel those things. Still a struggle but it‚Äôs getting better

To the point where I signed up for online college to get a degree in cyber security because that‚Äôs what the main character does. I named my new kitten after him (Elliot). When I‚Äôm working at my computer at home I wear a hoodie like he does and I listen to the soundtrack to make it feel like I‚Äôm really a part of it. It sounds crazy when I put all of these examples together but I really attached to the show to the point where I‚Äôm making it my personality...

I don‚Äôt feel interested in starting new friendships or relationships even though I need/want to because I feel like I get most of my needed attention from him and opening up to someone new is hard. He has other friends he talks to and brings over but I feel like if I talk to anyone else I‚Äôm ‚Äúcheating‚Äù on him even tho like I said we aren‚Äôt romantic... it‚Äôs frustrating.

I'll even remake the faces I made during the conversation to determine whether I looked stupid or not.

I constantly tell myself that the other person probably hasn't thought about the interaction since it happened, but it fails to make me feel better most of the time.

mentalillness,fgqkj8l,t3_ezu5u5,1581025957.0,One of the requirements to have DID is repeated severe childhood trauma from your primary caretaker(s). If you didn‚Äôt experience that  and don‚Äôt have PTSD you don‚Äôt have DID. It develops at ages 7-9 and it‚Äôs impossible to get it later on in life.
MrRobot,fgi745l,t1_fghhgeq,1580809029.0,"A part of DID is the brain puts up amnesic walls between personalities, so the host or other personalities don‚Äôt have to deal with the trauma.

It ended up being one of the reasons we broke up. Now i realize i deserve more than to be with someone who doesn‚Äôt reciprocate my feelings. It‚Äôs not your fault.
