quittingsmoking,fnrynkq,t3_g3kxmf,1587206656.0,"Every single time you think smoke, or cig, or anytime you are triggered by something to want a smoke say Fuck a damn smoke. Every single time. Words have power. When you say it to yourself say it with meaning. If that simple phrase isn't enough, think for a while on how fucking mad it makes you that there is a multi-billion doallar industry that has been built on a legacy of slowly and painfully killing folks by using psychological tactics learned by Freud himself. And now you are so completely addicted that you have to ask for help to quit pulling the smoke, killer smoke, into your lungs. If a forest or house was on fire would you walk up to it a breath it in for a while? No. That seems silly, but that is exactly how we got tricked psychologically into smoking. They made it seem doable and normal."
mentalhealth,fnibdnw,t3_g1q7tk,1586977135.0,That is not what cbt is. CBT is thinking the logical positive alternative. You must understand that there are both positives and negatives in this world. Which you choose to look at is your responsibility.
quittingsmoking,fn98tmr,t3_g0d7xs,1586763543.0,Attempting to change her will drive her further into smoking. In Israel these psychology students attempted an experiment on some people. They agreed with them. This for some reason caused the participants to question their deeply held beliefs. Let her smoke and be glad she's smoking and basically agree with her about her smoking. It might not cause her to quit immediately but I bet it'll have a better effect than attempting to change her in some direct way. That never works. Everyone is a rebel.

After many years of asking many questions and paying attention i came to some very valuable conclusions. They have almost driven me mad. They have driven me mad. I am crazy now. I know that my understanding is so incredibly disturbing it could one day lead to my suicide. I certainly hope I can shoulder the burden of this weight.

That's generally why it takes significant suffering to seperate us from a bad habit. Habit are strong. Habits to drugs or alcohol including cigs is much much more difficult to break. Good luck on your journey.
self,fhjudre,t1_fhjtfks,1581655880.0,When I quit weed and alcohol and everything else all at once I completely lost my mind. I mean to say that losing my mind was the reason I quit. For nearly three months or so I was damn near an invalid due to being heavily medicated to ease the psychosis. So quitting all that was a breeze. Quitting cigs is tougher for me due to that but I've heard cigs are harder to quit in general. I associated cigs with everything and every place. I only drank and did drugs in particular places. Don't get me wrong though. It is tough to quit weed or anything really that is a habit. If all else fails and you really want to quit you should consider AA or NA or something like that. I stay quit with AA. Good luck buddy. It is possible.
