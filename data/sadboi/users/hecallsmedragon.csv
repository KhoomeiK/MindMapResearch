femalefashionadvice,fkm1p8u,t1_fklt3m9,1584319261.0,"So I think you have to think about value in a few different ways. Investment means that you could sell it for more than you got it for. I am picky about metal for my earrings, because if I don't do surgical steel or high karat gold, I develop rashes. 

So what is ""value"" to you? Do you want the piece to hold up for a long time? Do you want it to survive being worn frequently? Do you want to be able to give the piece to the next generation? Then yes, you want precious metal, and a better kind of clear, colorless stone - not cubic zirconia, which apparently doesn't stay clear and colorless for long periods. 

There are a lot of kinds of clear colorless stones, besides diamonds, some of which are lab made, including but not limited to, white sapphire and moissanite. Generally where people care about stones is hardness and resistance to scratching. Diamonds are the hardest, though not the most scratch resistant (if I'm remembering correctly). I'm not an expert on that, but you could look into some of the guides people have created for engagement rings."
femalefashionadvice,fklkc5b,t3_fj7akb,1584308325.0,"Alright, gold comes in karats. 24 karat is ""pure"" gold, but pure elemental gold is liquid at room temperature. 24 karat is very yellow colored and very soft - like bite it with your teeth and leave a mark kind of soft. Jewelry made out of 24 karat is also very thick because it physically cannot be made thinner. Cultures which demand 24 karat generally do so because you can Melt it for more money if you have to. It was considered an investment in your future, especially for a woman. 

So lower the karat, less gold is in it. The Florentines, who are very good traditional gold makers, prefer 18k as sort of the ideal point between high gold content, and being workable in smaller, daintier pieces. By law, all gold has to be 18k in Florence. 

If buying gold, I'd go for 18k if I could afford it. My engagement ring is 18k, and so is my wedding band (though that's a whole other thing). If you want something to wear every day, you may consider what Color you prefer (white, yellow, rose gold) and that whatever is added to white gold in modern pieces often needs to be redipped or replated to maintain the white gold look. 

Diamonds are generally a terrible ""investment."" That is to say - if you are buying something expensive with the hopes of selling it at a higher number in the future, you are not going to do it off of gemstones or jewelry generally. That said, I'm not sure that diamond replacements like moissanite have been around long enough to see whether they hold any value on the resale market.

Depending on where you are, there may be independent antique jewelers who are worth talking to. I got my engagement ring from [Lang](https://www.langantiques.com/). If you're not near SF, they're around on Instagram, and seem like they like questions and educating people about jewelry, especially old jewelry.

bipolar,fk6dirv,t3_ffpmtm,1583899277.0,"Dr: Would you like to try a different drug? We want to raise your dose.

Me: No, just keep me on the same shit. I don't want to deal with med testing.

Dr: But you might gain weight if we raise your Seroquel.

Me: I'll deal with it then! I don't want to be more fucked up than I already am.

And that's how I'm up to 100 mg of Seroquel. At least my Regular doctor (above doctor, was not the regular guy) listens to me."
BipolarReddit,fk6cqc6,t3_fgl0v9,1583898729.0,"Lithium is liver processed, so any alcohol will fuck you up faster. At least that's what my doc told me. He said I Could drink, but it needs to be very little and very irregularly unless I want to fuck up my poor liver."

namenerds,fk332co,t3_fg3ehe,1583816107.0,I wonder if it was a family surname. The couple who overturned the ban on interracial marriage had the surname Loving.
Teachers,fk2qj2z,t1_fk2oxhc,1583806842.0,"I poked around the CalSTRS Web site and it seems like there's a way to get your contributions refunded if you're leaving the system. Something to investigate. 

And CA does CalSTRS only, no social security. I guess the teachers voted to not take part many decades ago."
Teachers,fk2nvf5,t1_fk2lxlo,1583805142.0,"Yeah, we don't pay social security Because we have Cal STRS instead. As far as I know requires five years to be vested. Otherwise the money you pay in just goes to the system. I don't know if you can get it back.

The other thing is when you get a job and they ask for verification of years worked, I guess your current place is threatening to not count this year, which I have no idea if they're allowed to do."
Teachers,fk2gy2a,t3_ffuu6q,1583800823.0,"In my district? If I've used up all my sick days and my personal days (different batch), then I think we're supposed to pay for our subs. Their pay is deducted from our check.

I have no idea about not teaching enough to get credit for retirement. The bigger question is have you done at least five years, so you're vested in the system and can get paid by it? Also I don't know that partial years can't be done in Cal STRS because I paid in as a sub and have a weird number."

Nothing goes OMG this is for me!! Though I did recently have the experience of, Everything that this is, I hate. 

In terms of couple pictures, less posed is probably better unless I can weave a whole other character and storyline #actorproblems

I think our venue has preferred vendors, so I'll check their photographers. Our closest friends getting married have polar opposite budgets, so we'll see if their recommendations are helpful at all. 

Thanks for the ideas!"
weddingplanning,fjy2ver,t1_fjy0eth,1583688725.0,"I think it would be helpful for me. 

I've also gotten ""documentary"" and ""photojournalism"" a few times, which sounds less like an editing style and more like a shooting approach. Do you have any expertise you'd like to share on that?"
weddingplanning,fjxw90c,t1_fjxsahe,1583684800.0,Thank you so much for the examples! I still don't know what I want but at least I have words and an idea of what they look like
weddingplanning,fjxw63q,t1_fjxqh3p,1583684749.0,"We're in the Bay Area, CA. Which means we will be spending a good amount. 

We haven't priced anyone out though our friends getting married soon are spending under 1k and our friends who got married last year don't want to tell us because it's a crazy high amount - they got three lay flat albums included. It was a crazy amount. In short - we don't have a budget yet, but are prepared to be shocked by prices.

I haven't looked at Instagram yet because honestly, most photos look the same to me? I know there are differences but if they're not side by side different styles everything just looks ""nice"""

One of the local high schools has been shut down for a few days. We shall see how it goes."
