depression,fk9d2dm,t3_fgnp3a,1583973588.0,"I feel that 100% I’ve always been able to fake being happy at work. I had some days in high school where I couldn’t but at work? Always smiling and cracking jokes. Except for today and I don’t know why I couldn’t fake it today. I took a half day becuase I didn’t want them to know I’m depressed or ask me “hey man you okay?” So I just told my foreman I had a doc appointment I forgot about. 

I’ve been doing everything right. Eating better. Getting more Sleep. Doing productive things like laundry and cleaning and working out and nothing has helped. It’s had the opposite effect and I couldn’t hide myself at work. I never ever showed any negative emotions at work other than piss and vinegar."

sexpertslounge,finq08h,t1_fin8ra9,1582568032.0,"I never even thought about “death grip syndrome” that actually makes a lot of sense I’ve been thinking about getting a flesh light but I’ve been kinda turned off by the stigma associated with it. Im also starting therapy soon for other reasons and I’m going to bring this issue up. You’re right we did try pegging and neither of us knew what we were doing. I’m gonna look into the aneros and talk to my girlfriend about giving it a shot. will absolutely give your podcast a good listen. 

You seem very educated on this subject which surprised me, I thought this was just a me thing. You read every part of my post and not only have possible problems but also solutions to each. I can’t tell you how much I appreciate this information and I appreciate the solutions and I appreciate you. I can’t thank you enough for this. 

I’m really thankful for your help and advice. This really surprised me that there’s a lot more information than I thought about this subject. Thank you again."
AskReddit,fimf6xs,t3_f8jxyc,1582527854.0,"I had gone over a friends house for his birthday. His older sister (my ex, year younger than me) is there and I thought she was still on a vacation with friends. 

We broke up a year before and I was still trying to get over it. We end up all drinking. I go to leave and their mother stops me asking for my keys. I end up staying a little longer hoping the mother would pass out and I could go home. She stayed up till I really had to sleep.

 My ex wanted me to sleep I. Her bed for old time sakes. I said “I don’t knkw about that. I don’t think it’d be right” she ends up pulling my upstairs, I agree to share a bed.  She starts to kiss me and I tell her:
“It’s only gonna lead to something both of us are going to regret in the morning, I don’t think we should do this” 

She says “alright fine you pussy” and then rolls over and I try to sleep. I wake up about an hour later with her on top of me  my pants down and my dick inside her. She said I was already hard so she knew I wanted it. I froze up for a min or two but it felt like forever. I pushed her off and drove home haven’t seen or heard from her since. 

I didn’t tell anyone. I feel embarrassed that it happened to me. I feel guilty that I put myself in that situation."
relationship_advice,fhk948m,t1_fhk8pcz,1581672869.0,"Yeah you’re right. I should be able to do it without medication until I talk to a professional. I’m just worried I’m going to loose it emotionally. But yeah. I shouldn’t take anything. I might work out before I shower in the morning to relive something. 

Thank you for the help you’ve given me tonight/this morning I really appreciate it. I’ll post an update/edit tomorrow night on how it all goes."
relationship_advice,fhk8bj4,t1_fhk81sm,1581671689.0,"Oh fuck. You’re right, I have a bottle of cologne she said she licked sitting in my bathroom cabinet. I do plan on dressing appropriate incase it does work out well and we have a decent ending to Valentine’s Day. 

I planned on cooking for us at my place, because its something I used to do until I relapsed hard. I want her to see that I’m taking steps to be better. 

I have problems with stress and controlling anger and lately when I cook if it doesn’t turn out just perfect it bothers me really bad. I’m nervous to cook again while our relationship is on thin ice. But I want to show her I’m trying to fix it. 

I’m debating on taking my roommates adderal to keep me happy and more controlling of my emotions but I don’t want her to think I’m abusing medications again. (Prior problem) even though it helps. 

I might ask her if she’s okay with me taking it without my own prescription if our initial conversation goes well."
relationship_advice,fhk7t7j,t1_fhk7k6g,1581670947.0,"I don’t plan on letting that happen and yes, words mean little to her right now and I need to show her that I’m getting better. She’s comming over tomorrow to talk about what we’re going to do, so today my room is the cleanest it’s been in months, my clothes are washed and closet is full of clean clothes for the first time ever. My oath room doesn’t reek of college kids and filth. I hope she sees these small things as big changes for me."
relationship_advice,fhk7oy4,t1_fhk7h4t,1581670775.0,"She’s been to a few doctors appointments with me for support and seen me shoot down therapy every time just looking for a one stop shop to get drugs to fix me when she knows I need the therapy. I’ve told her before I’d go and I didn’t. I’ve told her I went to the doctors and she saw me pass by her on the road to the liquor store. 

When I do good I’m usually alone. She sees me when I’m not and that’s what she sees and that’s what she believes because she doesn’t trust me. With good reason. But I want her to see the good I can do and have been trying to do. I want her around just a bit longer to see that I’m trying. 

Thank you for your kindness, support and reassurance tonight/this morning. I really needed it from all of you. Thank you."
relationship_advice,fhk7ckq,t1_fhk71r2,1581670294.0,"First, thank YOU and your husband for your service. My father was in for 31 years till my mother couldn’t take him being deployed anymore and he got out. It takes a toll having a spouse or close family member in the service. 

Second, I really appreciate your point of view. I understand that she’s worried, in a sense I’m glad she is because that means she cares. But it gets to a point where she stops worrying because she stops caring. I haven’t got there yet and don’t ever want to. 

Alcoholism runs in my family on Both sides, and it’s not pretty and hasn’t been pretty for years. It sucks and I never thought I’d be in that situation. But I some how related to it. 

I have learned from my relapses. I’ve learned what makes me want to drink the most to the point where I can’t stop myself. I can learn more with help from a professional, you’re right 100%. 

Thank you very much for both you and your husbands service and your sincere advice."
relationship_advice,fhk71w2,t1_fhk6trd,1581669883.0,"Thank you. I do need help. I want I get help. The only thing holding me back is myself. I want to show her that I’m ready to change. I’m ready to fix myself. I just don’t want to do it alone. I’ve done it alone once and it almost ended with a high jump. You’re right. I do need to SHOW her instead of tell her. 

I have a doctors appointment the 2nd of March. (Earliest one I could get) and I’m gonna talk to him about therapy options and medication. I already feel like I’m getting better just based of the past two days. 

I was really hyped to text her again and happy to hear from her until I asked “is this gonna be one of those talks where I end up alone?” And she replied with a “I don’t fucking know” 
I understand she’s still pissed at me. I get that and don’t blame her. I just want her to see that I’m trying."

relationship_advice,fhk66qz,t1_fhk5vo0,1581668671.0,"I know and can see that I’ve been nothing but a burden to her mental health. I feel really guilty for doing that, and I feel like it’s only just for me to fix it. You’re right. I have to fix myself first. It’s been a long and hard road so far and it’s only going to get harder. But you’re right. I need to work on myself first to be the best I can. It’s been 12 years since I’ve cried when my father left for Iraq in 07. Youve put me on the verge of tears with your sincerity and advice. I appreciate that very much. Thank you. 

Be the best you can be too internet stranger."
relationship_advice,fhk5xwm,t1_fhk5rpf,1581668330.0,Thank you for the “caring kick in the ass” I don’t get that often. You’re 100% right. I need help. I’m too scared to have my parents find out that I’m still not okay and that I’ve been lying to them about my mental health the past 6 years. But again you’re right. I do need to sit down with them and have a serious discussion about getting help I need.
relationship_advice,fhk5tl2,t1_fhk5kp2,1581668167.0,I broke it into separate paragraphs if that makes it any easier. I tried my best to have each paragraph be talking about a certain topic without it being too long. Thank you
relationship_advice,fhk5ldw,t1_fhk5ivi,1581667869.0,My parents would know becuase it would show up in the insurance statement that gets billed to their house. But yes you’re right. I’ve been looking at therapists online and have been trying to work up the courage to talk to my parents about it.

AskReddit,feimfes,t3_eddylu,1579141945.0,Pegging. I told my girlfriend about maybe trying it and she seemed really into it. So we tried it multiple times and she eventually started asking to do it to me. I didn’t really like it at all but she was loving it so much that I hated saying no. I eventually told her that I was really only pretending to be into it after the first time becuase she seemed into it. She said she was playing the part because she thought I liked it. Both of us were trying to make the other person not feel weird even though both of us didn’t enjoy it.

SuicideWatch,f9w5t2x,t1_f9w04ta,1575687474.0,I was raised to be independent. To be strong and deal with shit on my own. I don’t want my parents looking st me like a failure seeing I can’t even handle being me. Whenever I get a single hour of being happy it’s like opening a present and getting exactly what you wanted. I’m never happy. So when I am happy it’s short term and I’m like “Wow. Normal people feel like this all the time?”  I drink to numb the pain. The pain aka the lack of happiness. Not being normal

I’m trying to make a doc appointment for Tuesday but they’re not open today and I have work Monday -Friday and sometimes weekends. I’m shitfsced and want to die. I just called my girlfriend and I’m pretty sure it’s over.  I’ve got nothing left. I know it sounds selfish but I need her. I love her.

depression,f9vpgba,t3_e714ei,1575676262.0,"I’m sorry for your loss man. One of my buddies I served overseas with killed himself last month. He was my brother over there.  I loved him. We lived for each other day in day out every fucking day. I never saw any signs of depression or sorrow or anything remotely sad. We talked about everything. And I mean EVERYTHING. And he never showed anything that would make me even think he would frown let alone take his own life. I feel your pain and I share your message. It’s fucked me up lately, and I understand how it could affect you. Some people it doesn’t some it does. I don’t know HOW much it impacts you but from your post I can imagine a lot. I’m sorry about your friend and I’m sorry for his friends family and yourself that have to deal with the heartache. Im almost in tears reading how close you guys were because it reminded me of my friend. I feel your pain. I feel almost every word of it. Stay safe, take your time healing and always keep him in your heart and mind."
SuicideWatch,f9tju3r,t1_f9tiy2q,1575628222.0,Thank you for sympathy and advice. I can’t tell my parents. I don’t want them to worry about me again. I attempted in 2014 and was sent to the hospital and I saw my mother cry because of me. Because I caused it. I can’t put those thoughts in her head again.
