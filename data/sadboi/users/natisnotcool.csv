I once spent over 1 hour in the GP surgery (for something unrelated) because they kept dismissing what I was saying when I was being very clear and telling them what a specialist had told me. 

I might try and start asking for a specific doctor before switching. Hopefully if I get to speak to one of the senior partners things might be different."

Normally I can tuck myself away in my room and try to get on with it, but with having my parents around all the time now it‚Äôs unbearable as they think it‚Äôs unhealthy for me to be in my room and want me to spend more time with them. 

Because my mum is bored, she is singing a lot around the house and that just makes my head throb but whenever I say something to her she gets offended. 
 
Just small little things with my parents make it worse and that is affecting my mental health too."
