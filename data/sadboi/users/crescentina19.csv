WayOfTheBern,fji2um2,t1_fji1rcs,1583359695.0,Oh okay no hard feelings!! I thought you were coming from the moderate side. Yeah I am definitely disappointed too. We have all been working so hard to get the word out and get young people out to vote but many aren‚Äôt showing up! It‚Äôs frustrating for all of us.
WayOfTheBern,fjhxhcg,t1_fjh609m,1583356861.0,Excuse me? I am doing everything I CAN to get what few friends and coworkers and family I have to go vote for Bernie in Indiana. I have been volunteering for his campaign. Don‚Äôt tell me to fuck off when I‚Äôm trying. I just don‚Äôt want to be part of a party that hasn‚Äôt done shit to help the average American. People are suffering because the system doesn‚Äôt work for us!
WayOfTheBern,fjfsdpq,t1_fjfrrzn,1583298978.0,Me too. Is there a chance we can make a true progressive party? I‚Äôm sick of Democrats and Republicans controlling everything

StudentNurse,fczllt4,t1_fcyu3n1,1578103899.0,Thank you so much for the suggestions! I will definitely be visiting the tutors then and I‚Äôve been thinking about getting that headspace app for a while now so I guess it‚Äôs time to sign up.
StudentNurse,fcz5yde,t1_fcyqm4q,1578094339.0,I will definitely try to stick to exercise! I also like the idea of using my fear to motivate me. That opens up my perspective. Thank you for this.
