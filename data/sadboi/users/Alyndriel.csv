mentalhealth,fr12sbu,t3_gm18m3,1589812139.0,"I can’t imagine how hard this has been for you and your family. That’s a lot of stress for a long period of time, and it kinda sounds like you spend a substantial amount of time trying to figure out how to support and take care of everyone else and don’t have much energy at the end of the day to take care of yourself. I’d sure be exhausted if that were my situation. It sounds like you have set up some boundaries for yourself when it comes to what you are doing to cope, which is smart.

I’m not sure what mental health services are available near you, but I’d suggest looking for a counselor/therapist who specializes in addiction and trauma counseling. The addiction component will help them understand the family dynamic and challenges better, and their experience with trauma will help as you deal with the negative experiences you and your parents have lived through while trying to love on your sister. Living on high alert all the time because you’re worried about her takes a toll. It would be weird if it didn’t. Then there’s the family stress, the hospital visits, having to watch someone you really love struggle so much - that’s all trauma. Finding someone who can help with that specifically will go a long way towards helping.


Now, as for how to find a counselor, there’s several options. You can ask around your friend group to find good therapists or read online reviews. If that is too overwhelming because there are so many choices, I’ve found that it’s helpful to have a friend go through the options for me - sometimes it’s just too overwhelming to dig through that much stuff.  Be aware that you might not click with the first therapist - think of it as a sort of really weird first date. You’ll talk with each other for about an hour or so, then you can decide if you want to continue there or try someone else.  Remember that there’s nothing you can say that the therapist hasn’t heard, so don’t worry about being honest.

I hope at least some of this rambling has been helpful for you, and I’m sending you wishes for healing for you and your family."

mentalhealth,fpqlobt,t3_gey6fg,1588825752.0,"It sucks. It really really does. That cold but tingly almost heart stopping terror is absolutely something I would never wish on anyone ever in the history of things.  The physical sensations that can come with the panic can be scary.  I’m so sorry you are going through that. It can be fucking awful. 

I’m not sure if experience/advice will help or if you just needed to vent. If it’s the latter please skip right over the rest of this bit, but know that this random internet person hears you and sees you. 

I’ve been on Seroquel for a few years now. My shrink started it because I had racing thoughts and they were horrific. It’s kinda as though I had a tape player on endless loop telling me I’m worthless, no one cares about me, I’m a failure, I should just die already and get it over with.  My physical pain is usually in my chest or headaches and they are not a fun time. The meds helped some. It definitely took several visits worth of adjusting the dose, seeing how that went, adjusting again. For me it took a couple of months and part of it was inpatient to get that initial dose. The dose has been changed over the years, but Seroquel is the best thing for me so far. 

Sending hugs and support to you. Your experience doesn’t sound like something out of normal for this kind of diagnosis. Not saying that it is impossible for the “cure” to suck sometimes, because it can. It can also be OK once all the meds are sorted. 

It sounds cliche to say that knowing a diagnosis is the first step toward managing it but it can can help settle a  person and help get through things. 

Sending peace and hugs."

Meanwhile in Oklahoma, a mayor rescinded his order requiring people who enter stores or other businesses to wear a mask less than 24 hours after he issued it because so many people were threatening physical violence against workers. One of those involved a threat that the person would use their gun. On top of the potential physical violence, employees were being showered with a ton of verbal abuse.

Add into that the fact that our testing rates are horrifically low and that the governor has already lifted the stay at home suggestion while our cases are trending up, and we’re going to be a mess."
insaneparents,fpk17sr,t1_fpjzdjl,1588685902.0,It absolutely has something to do with the NRA. They’re the ones that keep blocking  common sense gun control legislation. After Sandy Hook they said that the only way to keep schools safe was to train adults to shoot the bad guy before he shot them.
insaneparents,fpk0zu8,t1_fpjxegl,1588685767.0,Yes. Yes it was. But the fact that a man got shot for doing his job and that even though these people weren’t allowed to have them does not negate the fact that there are fatality shootings every bloody day and many of THOSE are committed by legally obtained guns. The shooter at Sandy Hook used legally obtained guns. The Las Vegas shooter didn’t commit any crimes until he started shooting. The Parkland shooter bought his gun legally. Maybe the fact that this particular death was so senseless and so publicized will spark real debates on gun control. Given that we didn’t do squat after 20 little kids were killed at Sandy Hook and we did jack squat I’m not optimistic.
insaneparents,fpjt50w,t3_gdv6sr,1588680256.0,"Even for the U.S. this is beyond batshit crazy. I guarantee you that today there will be GOP politicians saying they give their condolences to the family but pushing for gun control is disrespectful while they’re in mourning, that making his death a political issue is manipulative. That now isn’t the time, he’s not even buried.

The problem is that there is never EVER a day here where people didn’t die because other people decided to shoot them.

For me, I had brain surgery my sophomore year of college to remove a benign tumor. Why? Because the insurance moved the medicine I had to take to keep the tumor from growing from preferred to non-preferred. That meant that instead of the $80 a month I had been paying (still a lot for a college kid) it would have been almost $400. I couldn’t afford that, and you can make a payment arrangement with a hospital but not a pharmacy. So yep, brain surgery. The insurance had to pay tens of thousands of dollars for surgery because they didn’t want to pay for pills. I owed around $1200.

The craziest part was the fact that if I hadn’t had insurance I couldn’t have afforded brain surgery OR the meds."

Parenting,fknhv67,t3_fjcijy,1584366131.0,"Please PLEASE recognize that while things are stupidly and ridiculously hard you are NOT failing. Failing would be staying home and not working if you were able to do so, or ignoring the needs of your kids, or mooching off of people with no intention of ever squaring things up with them.  “Wishing time away” isn’t a bad thing either. Honestly, it would be a little weird if you weren’t wishing it away. Things are super hard right now, you’re in a tough financial place, you’re scrambling almost every moment of every day - why wouldn’t you wish things were easier for you guys? 

You are working your ass off WHILE doing schooling to improve your situation WHILE taking care of what your kids need.

You aren’t a failure, you’re a rock star. Your kids are going to grow up learning that if something is really important to you, you fight for it. They’re going to see that hard HARD work pays off, even if it takes longer than you wish it did. They’re going to see that a good parent does whatever they need to do to take care of their family.  You are teaching them so many important things. 

On a practical note, please don’t feel bad about going to the food bank. I’ve had to do that before, and I remember feeling really embarrassed and ashamed. Which is ridiculous, because you’re just doing what you need to do to take care of your littles. Fuck the stupid bullshit idea of “if you’re working class or poor it must be because you are irresponsible or lazy or gaming the system”.  Bullshit. You are just getting food that is at the food bank for the exact purpose of helping people who can’t afford it.  Since you’re a student, I really encourage you to talk to someone at whatever student resource center you have - they will often know of programs or other things that can help that you might not know about. I know that even finding the time to do that will be a challenge, but it’s an idea.

AskReddit,fkl9n03,t3_fj5d81,1584301520.0,"First, thanks for asking this! It means that you’re paying attention to the person and trying to help. Here are a few things that have been helpful for me in the past. Please take whatever helps and leave the rest.. 

Make sure that they know that you are there for them. Depression is very isolating for me. Just knowing that I’m not alone can be a big help. Listen without judgment and reiterate that they are worth something. 

1) Ask them what would help - if they can identify something then that’s awesome!  They may ask you to help with things that seem ridiculously basic like taking a shower or getting clean clothes to put on. Depression sucks all the energy out and doing things that seem really simple can feel impossible. They may ask you to play video games or make dinner with them or sit and watch a movie.  If they can’t give an answer, you can make suggestions based on the things you know they like when they’re not in an episode. 

2) Are they in therapy? If they are, you could offer to take them to their appointment.  Driving can be intimidating, and forcing yourself to go when you’re really ill can be awful. Knowing that you’ll be there and take them can be a great catalyst for getting out of bed. If they aren’t, you can offer  help them find one because again, critical thinking may have gone the way of the dodo. If you need therapy and you open up the list of like 30 doctors in the area, that is super-overwhelming. Who do I pick? Do they take my insurance? How close are they?  When can I get in?  It’s a lot for anyone and it’s even more overwhelming if you’re being suffocated by depression. 

3) Just be present. When things are really bad, just sitting in the same room as my husband, kids, and animals. We don’t really talk, we just read, browse Reddit, work on craft stuff.  Sometimes we play board games.  It helps me to feel like there are safe people around. 

4) If the depressed person is up to it,  you can help them make a coping box. Get some index cards and help them write down some things that help them feel better.  Pet the dog, get outside, take a bath, meditate, color or draw, stuff like that. Put them all in a box (which the depressed person might want to decorate. Then when they are struggling they can pull one out of the box and then do that thing. I know it sounds cheesy, and it probably is, but when you’re super depressed it can be hard to think of ANYTHING that can make it better.  Just having that card show you something to do helps.

5) Tell them as much as you can in whatever way is best for the depressed person : You are enough. You have value and worth just on the basis of being you. You don’t have to earn my attention or care, it’s something I want you to have because I care about you.

I hope some of this helps! Good luck!"

ABoringDystopia,fkggrdz,t3_fibleu,1584159250.0,"For the same amount of money, 42 million Americans could each have up to $50,000 in student loans forgiven. We could have changed the lives of all those people by taking off that financial burden, allowing them to put that money toward buying a house or getting a newer car or traveling or just buying regular consumer products.

But fuck all those people, the top 10% apparently have holes in their money house so let’s stall the crash long enough for them to move their investments to safer places. Ugh."

I would have said that even without her use of the n-word toward your child, but THAT just reinforced my belief that you noping the heck out of there is absolutely the right thing to do for your family. You do not have to put up with racist and hateful things from someone just because they’re a relative - please get as much distance as you can from them."
