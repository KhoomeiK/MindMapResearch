I have been through many painful things in life, including surviving cancer and other shitty things, but nothing has even come close to hurting me as much as being locked up in the unregulated sanitarium of my childhood home.  By my early 30's, I had a breakdown and checked myself into a psych ward after a failed suicide attempt... and even that was a pretty positive experience.  I was treated better there than I was at home.

Nowadays, nearing 40, I only interact with my brother, grandma, and distant relatives who (rightly) see my branch of the family as diseased.

I'm happily married, have 3 college degrees, play in a few orchestras (after picking up the viola at 34) volunteer as a chaplain, and write as a freelance journalist for the Medical Cannabis community.

Just being able to have *friends* is better than the imposed isolation and endless treadmill of punishments for imagined crimes of childhood.   I can now accomplish things without them being demeaned or destroyed.

BeautyAddiction,fo6r00w,t3_g5pv54,1587565034.0,"I was a nail biter for 37 years and just stopped of New Year's this year... here is what helped me:

I purchased a manicure set for under $10 that included files, cuticle nippers, buffers, and cuticle pushers.  I watched youtube videos on how to use it all. (I also paid for a manicure by a pro in February to teach me what to do, but sadly that isn't an option right now... youtube works well though!)

I also purchased really good nail polish that mesmirizes me... ( I like holographic, rainbow, iridescent nails so I purchase mine from Tonic Polish or ILNP

I spend about 2 hours per week on my nails here is what I do:

1. Use nail polish remover to take off my old polish (use a cotton ball, hold it on the nail for a few seconds, then wipe the polish off)

2. Wash hands, Moisturize with a hand lotion.

3. Add cuticle oil on each cuticle, then use the cuticle pusher and the nippers to safely remove extra cuticle skin.

4. Shape nails with small clippers and a file if you can.  Don't worry, it takes practice getting it even... I am still learning too!

5. Wipe each nail with nail polish remover again to create a dry bed for your polish.

6. Use a base coat, 2-3 coats of color, then a top coat!!! Let the polish dry between each coat.  This us the hardrst part for me because I am clumsy, but  This is literally what stops me from biting.  It creates a thick, strong armor over the nails... without the base and top coat, I rip the polish right off!

7. If your polish chips during the week, redo that nail.  Unpolished nails get bit in my sleep, I learned... polished ones might end up with a bite mark in the polish now and again... but it tastes terrible and in a few months I seem to have broken my biting habit!

The key for me is keeping those 4-5 layers on my nails at all times.  

I hope this helps, you got this💚"

I don't have Lupus, but I do get occasional cysts/breakouts- I break out mostly when my skin dries out.  Many types of lotions/creams/masks are helpful to me...  what doesn't ever help me is full foundation.  I wear a full face sparingly as and only for a few hours.  Mostly I stick to moisturizer, spot conceal, eye makeup, light blush, and a lippie for ""put together, but not spending hours crying at my makeup table""


Right now there is a HUGE love of a thousand different types of skincare!  Many people can't wear foundation much at all because of the pore clogging properties- but I found that skipping foundation all together and trying all the neat masks and creams did far, far more for me than I expected.

I tried a few beauty boxes, after 3 months I cancelled them all since out of those three months I still have stuff I haven't tried.  When I find a face cream I like from those beauty box samples, I purchase it.

Others have triggered my allergies so badly I threw them out in disgust...but I also found obscure products that work great I never would have known about otherwise."

CPTSD,fnqd409,t3_g2vkjb,1587162263.0,"I mourn it all the time, however... here are some things I went through that could help you:

1. My parents were huge obstacles to me attending college.... I got around this by waiting until age 27.  I still got my degrees in Philosophy and Theology: cum laude.  Since I have disability from the trauma, I have ZERO student loans

2. My parents used to pull me out of activities I loved at your age.  There is nothing stopping me now, at age 38, from pursuing them.  I completed my first book at 30, I started the viola at age 34, and before quarantine, played with 3 orchestras. I volunteer as a chaplain. I am happily married, I live in a clean house I own with a bunch of happy rescue animals.  I work, when I feel up to it, as an artist and freelance writer

 My flashbacks are still hell, but my life is very low stress.

3. I self harm with trichto when I get overwhelmed.  I now have therapy, medication, and support I never had at your age.  

What I am trying to say, is just hang in there.  Life only improves when you are no longer forced to live around people who caused your trauma.  There are countless authors, artists, and other successful people.  Oprah was abused, Kurt Vonnegut lived through the worst parts of WWII and wrote his most successful works because of it.

As for Philosophers: Dostoyevsky, Nietzsche both suffered extraordinary hardships, both internal and external.  Galileo was constantly being attacked by the Church, and every single woman in the last 1000 plus years have had to fight extraordinary sexism and hardship to correctly be honored in history as our male counterparts. 

Further: Robin Williams and Jim Carey did not have depression that came from ""nowhere""... both also are survivors.

For musicians: there are too many examples to count of those who turned to music as solace to escape the abuses they suffered at home.  Any song by Korn or Everclear comes to mind, Marilyn Manson, Tori Amos, and Plumb, for starters. (I'm old😂 These guys are who came to mind first for me, I'm sure there are even better examples of modern artists)

Another more modern example: Look at how well Shiloh survived Onision... her new album is amazing and that girl was literally tortured by the dude.

We are in good company in CPTSD.  We may start later in life, but there are countless examples of brilliant people who were abused terribly and still made beautiful, lasting contributions to this world."

 I can't have children (infertile via cancer) but I am a tradwife with a homestead with our animals and somehow ended up with many beautiful godchildren💚

Folkish Norse religions really honor the home and family.  I may not have children of my own, but I have my religion degree so I serve my community as a chaplain.  

I have learned so much from the ladies on this forum, mainly, that all us religious folks end up pretty much loving the same sort of things: industriousness, healthy families, beauty, patience, and faith are all values we all seem to hold in common: Even though most of us come from radically different backgrounds.

Seriously, though. The best men are religious."

All the same advice for visual flashbacks applies, thankfully."
