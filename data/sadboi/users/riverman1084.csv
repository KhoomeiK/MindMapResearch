AskReddit,fpxqpbi,t3_gfsi0q,1588987654.0,"I've had a few experiences over my life that are unexplained. But, this one happened when I was a kid and on my 11th birthday. My brother died earlier that year from an accidental shooting. Him and his friend were playing with a gun and it went off and killed my brother. After his death I was really big into the after life and ghost and I still am. I also had a yak bak as a kid. For those who don't know what that is. It's like a voice recorder. I always asked if any ghost are around please speak into it. So, back to my birthday. After I had all my friends over and the party calmed down, I went to my room and noticed my yak bak was sitting out on my dresser. Which was odd because I had put it away in my night stand and no one went into my room. So, I hit play on it and see if anything was on it. So voice that came on it sounded like my brother and wished me happy birthday. I was a little confused and creeped out by it and I ended up putting the yak bak away and didn't touch it for a while. Sad thing when I took it out a few months later and wanted to hear the message, the batteries died in it. I think my brother wanted to cheer me up one last time and that was his way of doing it. I have a few other stories of hearing his voice I can share and also a few other unexplained events as well."
