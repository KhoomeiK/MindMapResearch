anxiety? check. depression? check. ED? check. PTSD? check.

StudentNurse,fi4cqgx,t3_f6ad8z,1582138540.0,"working full time and trying to get As in my program feels impossible. I'm generally a good student. I got a 90% on my TEAS exam (99th percentile for my program!) and I do almost all of the reading and make flash cards and do prepU questions only to get to the test and have questions like ""which symptom of meniere's disease is does the patient find most troubling?"" and when i chose vertigo the answer was tinnitus???????? it's a matter of opinion, i guess????

personally i'd rather be hearing a ringing in my ears than constantly feeling like i'm about to fall over but who knows!"
