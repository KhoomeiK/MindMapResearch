Psychosis,f8aaav7,t1_f878q3t,1574391837.0,"I stopped using anxiety medication after i discovered weed. But after a couple of months discovered the new, improved psychosis style of anxiety. Way, way worse."

Psychosis,f86t36t,t1_f86sp0m,1574306239.0,"Probably some people do, but it sounds like you're making a slow and steady recovery so I wouldn't worry. Thought I know that isn't useful to hear when you're worrying about it. I thought I was going to be dumb for the rest of my life, I'm excited for next summer when I feel like I'll be totally back to normal - fingers crossed."
Psychosis,f86qvol,t1_f86qm8h,1574304718.0,"I never asked that specific question, they just said it takes time. But I'm confident now - and believe me I wasn't before - that I will make it back to 100%. What did your doctors say?"
Psychosis,f86qjn3,t1_f86q4v1,1574304490.0,That's about where I was. I'm a year in and now at 90%. It's hard but you have to be patient with yourself as you heal. It was a traumatic event you went through. But you will get through it.
Psychosis,f86q0nq,t1_f86pdt5,1574304135.0,"It gets better. You just need lots of rest and it takes time, I felt like shit for months after it happened."
Psychosis,f86pblg,t1_f86o7yu,1574303682.0,"I think the psychosis did. But it heals in time, the abilify helps. I think the olanzapine made the psychosis go away. How are you feeling now?"
Psychosis,f86nsd4,t1_f86l4z0,1574302684.0,It's like olanzapine but doesn't zombify you
Psychosis,f86i0or,t1_f86hh1h,1574298703.0,Yeah first olanzapine and now abilify. That sucks. The hospital is the best thing for it though it's necessary to get rid of the psychosis I'm glad I went. Missed my dog though. Totally turned me into a zombie as well. Hope things get better for you.
Psychosis,f86dyis,t3_dzahgb,1574295824.0,"Took me about a year to fully recover. I still have episodes of paranoia sometimes. At about 90 percent I guess, still have confidence issues and can't think of stuff to say a lot of the time. It is a gradual process, get lots of sleep and eat healthy, take care of yourself. Hope you feel better. How long did your episode last? Did you end up in the hospital?"
Psychosis,f6g9d5q,t1_f6fjv03,1572823302.0,You might have just had a really bad panic attack. I've had those before. Hope you're ok it doesn't sound like maybe it was psychosis if that helps.
Psychosis,f4ovjmo,t3_dlak4b,1571709385.0,I dont have any good advice other than to maybe go up in dosage on your docs advice while continuing to excercise... sorry bud i know how hard it is ive gained a ton of weight on abilify and am struggling to lose it. but at least the stuff helps keep the demons away
BipolarReddit,f1qzyiq,t1_f1qckse,1569709277.0,Yeah the eye weight is the worst. Like there's lead just hanging over your eyelids.
BipolarReddit,f1qzv9t,t1_f1qcpyp,1569709229.0,Lol yeah moody and weird is a good descriptor of me and my state. I just slogged through a birthday party to keep up appearances and maintain my social network but all I want to do is hide. Sometimes I build a sort of fort in my bathroom where it's the darkest and just crank up waterfall sounds and try to sleep there during the day on weekends.
BipolarReddit,f1qzlhe,t1_f1qwd5w,1569709088.0,That's good you have one. I should probably look into this a little. I was thinking of volunteering at a shelter to get to know my way around.
Psychosis,f1q9lmp,t1_f1c18jh,1569696295.0,Not completely. I hope I do soon. I feel a lot better that's for sure.
Psychosis,f1bz2o0,t1_f18tsps,1569346207.0,I like the analogy of safe mode. That's about how long it took me to recover.
bipolar,f1ag0pl,t3_d8gsyp,1569293004.0,"I don't have a trick but I find that spending time with friends and telling them about it helps. It took me a long time to be able to blurt about this stuff. 

In the absence of friends pretty much I just try to distract myself. Movies. Tv shows. Even just white noise. Until the thoughts go away."
Psychosis,f0mp4rv,t1_f0moriv,1568750025.0,Hope that recovery comes
Psychosis,f0mp3t8,t3_d5lllt,1568750008.0,Fried my brain as well. Slowly recovering. Confidence is shot. Personality isn't the same I'm not as outgoing. My anxiety is worse. Generally just bad stuff.
Psychosis,f03078x,t3_d3i6vp,1568341734.0,I thought I got dumber after psychosis but nos I think it's just brain fog that is in the way. It's slowly been getting better. And when I have a few drinks it clears up which isn't a solution hah but I'm not going to believe I'm dumber anymore.
BipolarReddit,f02ye1d,t3_d3hhsm,1568340699.0,"Let's feel alone together. I'm feeling pretty lost and alone right now too.

Psychosis,eyoukoo,t3_cxc176,1567283578.0,It's been a long road for me but I'm leaps and bounds better than I was a year ago. I keep getting better slowly but surely. I hope in your case it gets better friend.
Psychosis,eyou65z,t3_cxvvg1,1567283383.0,I had a few weeks where I was convinced that there was going to be nuclear war. It didn't help that there was a major power outage. That was a fun couple of weeks.
Psychosis,eylt4yk,t1_eyl3e0b,1567191373.0,Yeah I was not taking care of myself while traveling not enough sleep food or water. Too much stress. Feeling better now.

Psychosis,eyjh2tc,t3_cx8a0s,1567119038.0,I'm positive I threw it out. It was something that used to mean a lot to me but I decided I didn't need it anymore. I have a specific memory of throwing it away.

depression,et72nuj,t3_ca9mwu,1562523495.0,Make a point to remember everyone's name and say it to them when you meet them. Doing that at the beginning will make it easier to remember later. And people like hearing their names.
