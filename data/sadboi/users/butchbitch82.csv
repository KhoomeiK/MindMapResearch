There's no way someone will understand what unmedicated mania is like unless they have experienced it. It turns into them jumping to conclusions or blaming it on personality flaws of mine. 

I've been told that I refuse to take responsibility for my actions when it came to mania. I've been criticized for ""blaming my mental health"". That's not what it is. I take full responsibility for everything I did and it absolutely sucks that I did those things, but I can't take it back. I'm trying to express the difficulty in managing such a disorder and ultimately ask for their support in certain aspects. Sometimes I just need to cry to someone. It's how it is.

I don't plan on talking about it anymore with people in my life. It just leads to problems and it's no ones business but my own.

mypartneristrans,ewx4aqk,t3_cqfc2r,1565843874.0,"Hi, I'm a cis female and my boyfriend is also ftm. I think there are two ways of looking at it. One way is really nice and the other is just a little nice.

1. She could just be really attracted to your body. I can't express how attractive I think my boyfriend's body is. He's very handsome and my attraction to him (sexually) has never been a problem. Then the emotional connection and romantic attraction just adds to that, making the sexual attraction even stronger. When he gets top surgery, I know he'll still be attractive. No matter what we do during sex, he's STILL SO ATTRACTIVE! 
2. This is coming from my first relationship I was in. I was dating a mtf girl. Also, I identify as a gay woman. I've honestly never been attracted to a penis (if that makes sense). Sex with her was a little scary and uncomfortable at first (but that's probably from past trauma), but since I thought I loved her, I found her sexually attractive. One feeds into the other very easily. That didn't make my attraction to her any less valid.

I hope the second thing doesn't sound too harsh. I don't know your relationship, but I would guess that you both fall into the first situation. This is just something you'll have to understand. I'm going to speak in absolutes because this is my opinion, but I again, don't know your relationship. There's no point in her lying to you. It wouldn't make her happy and it wouldn't make you happy (because anyone can sense a fake compliment). 

Take every compliment she gives, every form of affection, sign of attraction and remember it when you're feeling insecure. As a partner, it's hard to reassure someone that you really do love them -- all of them -- and find them attractive or whatever else they say to you. 

This might sound really insensitive, but I hope it doesn't come across that way. As a partner of a trans person, I feel it is partially our job to show our support. Any relationship should have support on both ends -- but I think we have to show a little extra support when it comes to topics that relate to transitioning and attraction etc. It just becomes difficult to always show that support.

I hope this doesn't seem insensitive or anything like that."

With situations I've been through, I always have to make jokes about them so that I don't take them seriously because if I do, I get really sad. I've realized this, but I can't help but do that. It's just a comfort thing I guess. And my boyfriend has noticed this -- I think it makes him uncomfortable and upset that I can't take things seriously."

The average GPA is at least 0.5 lower than the university average (4 point scale). Engineering is so damn intense. If you don't agree, that should maybe tell you that you're doing well. 

A GPA isn't the best way to mark success. Unfortunately, that's how colleges do that, though. If you are learning and you can still continue with your education, I would find comfort in the fact that a lot of other people are in the same boat. 

Can you get an internship anywhere? Usually engineering internships are paid. And even if it's in a mechanical engineering gig or something, it's still engineering.

SuicideWatch,evrr2nn,t3_cky70u,1564715955.0,"Hi, I'm also a gay woman (it's complicated by that's the simplest way of putting it). It's a huge stereotype for women to get so close and feel like they've lost everything after a breakup. Honestly, (I hope to god my partner isn't going through my reddit), I thought I was going to be with my last partner forever. I'm naive when it comes to newer relationships, so I find it really easy to attach and commit. 

Breakups are the worst. Like absolute worst. I'm going to talk about myself some more because I'm selfish, but that wasn't the worst breakup I've had. My worst breakup was from an abusive relationship and I was suicidal when things ended. I'm sorry that you're going through this and I can only imagine what that feels like. My heart goes out to you. I'm always here to talk if you want to chat with another lesbian about what's going on -- maybe that's comforting, maybe it's not.

Finances are also the fucking worst. It's such a slippery slope and it seems that one mistake leads to ten more, but one step in the right direction is only helping half of a problem. I don't know if that makes sense, but it's understandable how your situation is. You aren't doing things wrong. You're doing the best you can and that's really impressive.

When I wasn't doing too well, I thought I was out of options too. I was afraid no one would love me again and I lost any chance of a relationship in the future. Fortunately, there are so many more opportunities, but unfortunately, you have to stick things out for them to come. You seem like a smart person. I hope there are times when you can see that you are doing the best you can and that sometimes you can't control things that are going on. I think you should really ""stick things out"". 

I really hope you don't do anything any time soon. Also, I would guess that therapy isn't really an option (because I know it's expensive) , and maybe medications aren't either. That's concerning to know that a person in a place like this can't quite get access to the resources they need. I'm always here to talk. Utilize reddit like a form of therapy.

I think it hurts so much physically, that you forget or can't really see how bad it is mentally. You definitely are suffering mentally, there's no doubt about it, but your hunger is definitely masking some parts of your mentality. 

I would urge you to get a meal somehow. I know it's not the smartest to tell someone developing an ED to just eat, but it's super important to get some nutrition in your system. I hope that you do because it might help you think more clearly. 

If you've made it this far, I really think you can make it a little further, at least. If you could take this one day and one obstacle at a time, I think that could help. Sleeping and eating are the first steps to getting better. Then, if possible, go for a walk or something. Getting around and moving really helps too. 

So many people say eating, sleeping, and exercising help mental health, but they're not wrong. Walking around can help you think differently. It just changes things. I don't know.

From experience, I was in a really bad relationship where I was regularly beaten down verbally and physically. I had to learn that her inability to accept that I just get sad sometimes was not a flaw of mine. It was just a bad relationship. Mental illness doesn't just go away, so I hope you can find a partner that accepts you and wants to take care of you.

I've been there and I was hospitalized because I wasn't talking to my friends about things and he knew I was going to do something serious. Opening up has helped me get closer and eventually manage my mental health better. 

I hope you can at least have one very close friend to open up to. I think it's very common for young people to experience mental health related issues these days -- it's unfortunate. 

Lastly, please make sure you take care of yourself and the people you talk to take care of themselves too. It's easy for people, in my experience -- mostly women, to internalize someone else's troubles. Make sure you are handling things instead of just dumping your problems on to someone else. It is very hard and I made that mistake. I don't know how to keep from doing it though. 

You just have to be able to respect them if someone says they can't talk about your mental health for a little bit. I personally had to explain to a girl that I couldn't listen to her make suicide jokes and talk about intrusive thoughts. It was just too much for me. I also made anxiety and depression worse for one friend specifically. 

A ton of people are dealing with many different things so don't feel alone. You can open up if you're comfortable. Just make sure you're comfortable. If you don't want to open up to people in your daily life, utilize reddit. That helps a bit too."

I can’t handle knowing that she was dealing with that shit and didn’t even talk to me about how bad things were getting. I had to be so oblivious and focused on my own shit. I have to tell myself she’s selfish because I can’t really live with the idea that I helped kill her. 

When someone says they’re suicidal, I had friend tell me about how heavy it is on them — how hard it is to say anything meaningful. And the depressed person will always dismiss it because nothing matters. 

I don’t know. I’ve been on both sides but get yourself some fucking help if you’re suicidal. I can’t do anything anymore. She fucking ruined me for the time being. One person wasn’t feeling okay she spread her unhappiness to everyone around her. It’s so fucking contagious and I can’t stand this shit. 

People fucking try to help. I don’t know how to say this nicely, but listen to people. If you want to die, you don’t seem to have much interest in anything, so listening can help. And they want to listen too."

bipolar,euhyo4r,t3_cgi9xt,1563836802.0,Sometimes I feel like the people that have it don’t even understand it. Like know what knows what I’m dealing with except for me. I don’t know how to explain that thought.
bipolar,euavl0o,t3_cfg9pj,1563633260.0,"I love people posting pics of their pills because 1. It’s a fun game of “what have I been on, too” and “what do I recognize” and 2. It helps me see that it’s okay that I take “antipsychotics” and meds made for disorders I’d consider extreme. — it just helps me feel more normal."

I’m sorry your friend passed. I’m sure you were a really positive aspect of their time."

Criticism; who wears shoes on carpet? What if it gets dirtyyyyy? Then you’ll have to shampoo your carpets. Then you’ll have to get rid of the dirty water ;)

medizzy,et6ivzp,t1_et5ki6c,1562513621.0,"Out of the few trans people I know, if the MTF people don’t want bottom surgery, it’s because they’re afraid of the pain — USUALLY (with the people I’ve encountered. Not trying to generalize). 

The FTM people don’t want bottom surgery because it is extremely complicated right now and not advanced enough. There’s also a high chance of it being botched. It’s not the pain they worry about, but the scars on your legs and arms along with a broken penis. :("
