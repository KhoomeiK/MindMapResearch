Anxiety,fpnqxy2,t3_gee1ds,1588770635.0,"It took me ages to get my license; I passed the written test when I was 15 but only got my license when I was like 21. I developed really bad driving anxiety in between because I went from an actual driving instructor to my dad who basically just screamed at me the whole time. So I guess my first advice is to make sure you and your instructor are compatible haha

Just keep practicing! I know that sounds so basic but just keep practicing until you’re comfortable, then slowly add in new ‘challenges’. For example, I drove the same route to school every single day until I felt really comfortable and familiar with that route, then I would change up the route here and there. So maybe you can keep driving around the parking lot then one day maybe try exiting the parking lot, circle the block, then come back. Or you could drive a route you know really well. It’s easier if it’s a familiar road because you know what to expect and can just focus on the actual driving. 

Remember, it’s not a race! Everyone goes through life at their own pace. Just breathe and reassure yourself that you are in control. I hope this was helpful in some way. Good luck!!"
Anxiety,fpnpcgu,t3_gef0z5,1588769550.0,I feel you. I’m 24 and I constantly think about the fact that I’m unemployed at this age. I’ve had one job (retail) and it lasted for a few months but I was extremely anxious every single day I worked there. That was 3 years ago. I feel like everything is just too much for me to handle and that makes me feel pathetic.

AskReddit,fpjqglp,t1_fpijeft,1588677915.0,"THIS. My parents always took everything to a 9, no matter how small it was and it would give me so much anxiety as a kid. I always felt like (and still do) every mishap was the end of the world.

I sometimes think this is why I have such intense perfectionist tendencies."

Anxiety,fa9s0em,t3_e87o2w,1575888893.0,"I failed my driving test multiple times so I know how you feel OP. Don’t beat yourself up too much about failing, each failed test is preparing you for the one you’re going to pass! Just keep practicing and if you get overwhelmed while you’re driving, I’ve found that taking deep breaths (look up belly breathing) and reminding myself that “I am a good driver” and “I am in control” really helps. Good luck!!"
Anxiety,f8s4eg1,t3_e1jgd5,1574768666.0,"I relate so much to this. I worked at a small video rental store that was also a post office, a gift shop and a lotto store (lol I know). There was so much to remember and it was so overwhelming. I often had to work so I had to juggle renting out videos, mailing parcels, selling stuff, & lotto all by myself. I have really bad perfectionist tendencies so every mistake I made would just destroy me. I eventually quit and I remember being so relieved that I didn’t have to work there anymore."

Anxiety,ewli69k,t3_covnp6,1565525284.0,"You're definitely not alone! I used to be such an anxious driver, but the more you do it the easier it gets. I definitely recommend going on google maps to figure out the 'easiest' route to your work. It doesn't matter if it takes longer, as long as you're more comfortable. You can even go onto street view and follow the route so you can be more familiar with the surroundings. Try practicing this route before you actually start work, so then when the day comes you won't have to worry about it as much because you've already done it.Just keep following that same route and eventually you'll be more comfortable driving, and then you can start slowly stepping out of your comfort zone. 

You've got this!! Just remember that you are capable and in control. Good luck with your new job! 😊"

 I just pushed through it because it was so satisfying and it made me so happy that I was actually doing it and I wanted to complete the trip and not let my anxiety win.

Anxiety,eu2v3bp,t1_eu1y6q1,1563398801.0,I had a friend with me! I was kind of worried because I had never driven her before but she was the best. She was calm and gave me clear answers when I asked. She’s also a confident driver so it helped me to know that she could take over at any time if it got too much for me (which thankfully it didn’t!).

Anxiety,eu2uhzh,t1_eu1yw0v,1563398415.0,"I had been extremely anxious about it for months and had all these elaborate plans of how to get out of driving lol. My friends basically convinced me that the only way out is through. Also when I told my parents about my plans, I fully expected them to doubt my abilities but they didn’t even care (as in they didn’t think it was a big deal) which made me feel very...trusted? So that helped me a lot. 

I also told myself positive affirmations like “I am confident” “I am in control” “This is temporary”. On the day, I had a friend with me in the car who was a confident driver who I asked questions and it helped knowing they could take over in a worst-case scenario. 

But just breathe and try to stay calm. Stick to the ‘slow’ lane and people will just overtake you. Give yourself a lot of time to get to your destination so you don’t feel rushed. Study the route you’re going to take. You can do this! I believe in you. 💖"
Anxiety,eu2swqk,t1_eu1yfr4,1563397388.0,You’ve got this!! Gradual exposure helped me a lot too. I think it’s because I get to set the limit of how far I step out of my comfort zone so it’s not too overwhelming for me each time. 💖

I did text her and unfortunately the above was her response. I’m honestly kind of shocked that she wasn’t more understanding because she’s one of my best friends and she knows about my driving anxiety. When I apologised and said I would drive us, she THEN started being more supportive. 

I’m going to follow through and drive us to the event just because, as she so kindly informed me in her text, she has “put in a lot of money and effort to come”. 

After this I’m definitely going to put some distance between us while I (hopefully) sort myself out, because I don’t really want to be around people who are only supportive and compassionate when it suits them.
