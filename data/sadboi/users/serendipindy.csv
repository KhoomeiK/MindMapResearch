There is absolutely nothing about companionship that makes it worth living with someone who leaves you resentful and overburdened. 
I read that humans grow up observing the gender roles in their household and fairly naturally mirroring them. Men grow up not being taught to see the things that require cleaning and tidying. There is a real cultural blindness to these things. The closest thing I could compare it to would be not having words for objects so you can’t talk about them or even identify them. 
Women are also conned in to thinking that the light household repair men do are beyond them and complex tasks men learn from childhood. They aren’t. Most household repairs, broken down in to simple steps, are things anyone can do with the proper tools. It’s ingrained in women that the household “honey do” list is something beyond her scope of ability. It’s generally simple stuff that can be done quickly, easily and with a sense of satisfaction at taking care of your property. 

If I were a paranoid person, I would think modern life was the biggest con men ever perpetuated against women. Don’t misunderstand, I love men. I just can’t live with someone who wasn’t taught to be an equally contributing adult."

In other words, processing this information subconsciously before it is passed on to the rest of the brain for detailed processing accelerates judgment and decision making when a fast reaction is needed.This ability, though highly specialized for the processing and recognition of human emotions, also functions to determine the relative threat of wildlife we encountered."
