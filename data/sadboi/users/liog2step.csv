Thank you for writing to us about your booking and the change you want to make to it. I'm so sorry to disappoint you, however we‚Äôre unable to make any alterations to bookings, or cancel them, via email.
The information below only applies to bookings made directly with us. If you booked with a travel agency, online travel website (except Skyscanner or Kayak) or another airline please contact them directly for assistance.

Booking changes don't work well in an email conversation, as vital flight seat availability can be lost while we wait for each other to reply, plus we sometimes need to give you quite detailed information which isn‚Äôt suited to time-lapsed email replies. Additionally, there are payment protection regulations that mean we can't ask for your card details in an email, if we need to take any extra money from you.
If you‚Äôre wanting to cancel anything from within your booking, again there‚Äôs detailed information you‚Äôll need from us which isn‚Äôt suited to an email conversation.
