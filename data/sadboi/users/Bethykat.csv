I know you don’t want to hear that and I’m sorry. You are brave for leaving and I’m proud of you. Things will be get better. My advice if you can’t afford therapy is to find a sliding scale fee therapist and work out something you can afford. There are state or government run places all around.  You will need this guidance and support. 

You have made the hardest step in the healing process which is leaving. Now you get to heal and be free. The addiction fades. You need to remain strong. I believe in you! 💜"

This led to a ton of trauma and past trauma and extra therapy. However, they were supportive in my mental health struggle. There is no guarantee but it can’t hurt to try. Also disability services, I was more embarrassed to do that and rather hide behind my email. Don’t be afraid. You deserve compassion. Best of luck!

It reset the brain in a positive way for me in that moment but it didn’t fix my problems. And the results aren’t guaranteed to be positive or helpful and as my therapist said could be dangerous and harmful.
adultsurvivors,fopdtrj,t1_fopbdhr,1587958983.0,"33/f 
I absolutely understand what you are saying. I too have been in all those situations with people I considered friends. 

Therapy has helped me first off begin to identify red flags. Not just identify them but also how to accept and walk away from them. Therapy has taught me I can trust another human being and create a safe place in life. I too was sexually abused from age 5 to 11. Safety is a big issue for me. Creating a safe place. Creating safety with others. And learning how to trust. 

I’m just in the beginning to be honest. I haven’t done a lot of trauma work but my therapist wants to do emdr therapy once we can see each other in person again. I suffer from flashbacks, nightmares and panic attacks. I also grew up with a narcissist father and an enabler mother. Love and compassion weren’t high priority in my home. Home was never a safe place. Therapy is teaching me skills and tools to handle and deal with those traumas. To love and respect myself and create healthy boundaries. 

Therapy is truly what you put into it. I don’t want to hurt anymore. I want be be healthy. I want to have successful relationships. You can to if you are willing to put the effort in."
ChronicPain,fop7x6z,t3_g8mlji,1587955081.0,"I wish. But they won’t get it. I deal with two different types of pain and I try to be as active as possible.

therapy,fooo3nu,t3_g8jcoc,1587942891.0,"Life is a series of choices. Sometimes those choices aren’t what we want but what we need. In the current pandemic, we are now faced with a different set of choices. Keep making the choices best for you. 

Everyone is struggling. That does not mean your feelings and struggle is more or less than anyone else and that those feelings aren’t valid. School is important. Yeah we think oh I’ll never need this information and yeah half the time you are right. However, you have gained knowledge and knowledge is power. 

Social media is a huge problem with a unrealistic picture of people’s lives. For the most part people don’t share the day to day or hard times. We are what they want us to see, and I’m guilty too. We post our exciting happy times and show off those really amazing moments. However, that is just a small piece of their lives. Not every moment is that amazing! Sometimes you have to make the choice to work on something that is mundane or just straight up boring to get to the next part of life. It can be incredibly depressing. You are not alone in that feeling. Just remember you can make the choices to have those experiences too. You just can’t have them ALL THE TIME. 

Chin up. Things are very hard right now. If you are having these feelings, my best advice is seek out therapy. It truly is life changing if you put in the work. Don’t be discouraged, and I know that is hard, life is ever changing and you are the one who gets to break the cycle. Because Remember life is a series of choices. Choose to break your cycle. Choose to change your perspective. Choose to make healthy mental decisions. You are worth it, but the choice is up to you."
adultsurvivors,fookrw4,t1_foogz0y,1587940934.0,"Thank you. I have a lot of repressed memories. Some of those have started to resurface, during the pandemic, which where triggered right before from an abusive relationship I escaped from. This is a horrible time to be working on trauma through teletherapy. However, at the moment it’s all we have and I’d rather have that then dealing alone. I see my therapist twice a week and see a psychiatrist regularly. 

Trust is the first step in therapy for me. If you don’t trust your therapist you are not honest and if you are not honest how can they help you? They can’t build the puzzle if you don’t give them the pieces. It’s incredibly hard to talk about the horrors of your past. There is shame, anger, guilt, fear, anxiety, and so much more that creates a barrier we have to cross. However, the therapist doesn’t find us, we find us with the tools and guidance they provide. It’s okay to feel lost or confused. What is not okay is not seeking help to not feel that way anymore. I hope the OP seeks the help they need. No one should live in that pain. I don’t want to live in that pain anymore."
adultsurvivors,fonvbk5,t3_g8ix2c,1587927174.0,"I feel you in this. My childhood was ripped away and all the innocence. The personality was was squashed. It seems like as an adult I missed so much of the integral milestones of growing up. I have zero compassion for myself yet have an amazing ability to have compassion for others. I don’t feel loved by anyone and even when they say it I can’t believe and question their motives. 

Therapy has been the best thing to happen in my life. I’m a few months shy of three years and on Friday I realized I actually trust my therapist. I have trust in another human being. It still causes anxiety but the trust has been built. 

I’m currently practicing compassion for myself. My self esteem is in the negatives and I don’t even consider myself human. I have come to at least acknowledge I have a life time of trauma to work through. Seeing myself as worthy is my first big hurdle. Recognizing I deserve love and compassion. I could never do that on my own. It’s beyond hard work and I have only just begun. It took three years to feel safe in a therapeutic environment. It took me that long to trust and accept that trust. You are not alone. The first step is recognizing you don’t want to feel the way you do. Search for a therapist you click with. Put the work in. Dig into that trauma. It will always be there but it is not who you are. You are an amazing person. Now it’s time for you to believe it! Best of luck! You are loved. You are beautiful. You have worth. You are more than your past."

ptsd,fomafc2,t1_fom9m7k,1587883200.0,Thanks. With things so weird so covid19 and everything moving to online I never thought to reach out to the disability center. This assignment was due in March. I was working on it and I was triggered really bad and shut my computer down and never looked at it again. My professor emailed me that the assignment was missing and I waited about 5 days before sending a pathetic email trying to explain myself. The professor was awesome and said trauma and therapy were a reason for late submission and to turn it in when I could. I’ve been sitting in it a week and can’t get anywhere. Today I worked for an hour until I just gave up. It’s about 75% done. I think I’m just going to turn it in. I’m tired of thinking about it and I’m tired of having it hang over my head.
therapy,foi8i8m,t3_g7hohb,1587780935.0,"So I’m a few months shy of three years. Today my brain clicked. Today I have accepted that I’m safe in therapy. Today I know I trust my therapist. Today we stopped circling at the starting line and will make the journey forward. Yes, it has taken me this long to actually trust another human being. However, as my therapist said to me there is no time limit or speed for this process. I have been seeing my T twice a week for almost a year. We have worked on many things that are minor but now the trauma work begins, well after quarantine. 

My life is changing. I’m learning how to trust. I’m learning I’m a worthy person, although I still struggle. I’m accepting that although others have different trauma, mine is valid. I have CPTSD, but that is not who I am. I’m learning I don’t have to control everything but I can control my actions. I’m learning not to be controlled by fear. 

Therapy is a process. You get out of it what you put in. Time is irrelevant. Yes it’s expensive, but if you value yourself and your mental health it’s money well spent."

therapy,fn8yriz,t3_g03elp,1586753984.0,"Boy do I know the struggle!! Been seeing my T almost three years and let me tell you opening up is worst than the trauma itself. For the first two years I really just talked about my week and basic bullshit. Then one day out of the blue I said I had at least 5 things I had a lot of shame about and couldn’t talk about. He looked at me and said tell me one. Just one. I sat back and picked the least of the 5. I spilled it all and laughed when I was done because compared to the other 4 it was ridiculous. I think I shocked him but he took it and we talked about it that day and have never revisited the topic because really there is no need. However, that moment that “spill” I found a little bit of trust in my T. I didn’t even realize it then but slowly we have created a great relationship. I have been able to be more open. 

Now, of the 5 things I couldn’t speak about I have gotten through 3 I believe, the biggest just last week. In an email. I have learned I’m still uncomfortable and afraid but have created trust and I can email those things he needs to know and not have to speak them. I have also found I had more than 5 things I didn’t want to talk about. I have ALOT I don’t want to talk about. He gentle with me. He’s not pushy. He lets me lead and in those days I’m shutdown he will call me out and oddly enough make me feel comfortable and I’ll talk. 

Key is creating that trust in the relationship and that takes time. It took me two years and really a new traumatic event. He’s still earning my trust. I have to let him earn that trust. I have to be honest about how I feel. I have only recently done the emailing important information thing. I sent an incredibly open honest email and he never responded. I sat in anxiety for two days before our next session. I didn’t say anything but it bothered me and it hurt my trust. I eventually sent in a new email it bothered me. He apologized the next day and now emails me back. If I hadn’t expressed my feelings that trust would have been completely broken. 

Take notes, send emails, write letters do whatever it takes but build that trust. Create a good relationship and if you don’t it won’t work and if you can’t find someone else. Best of luck!!!"
therapy,fn1wbgj,t3_fypd2t,1586571666.0,"I too have sexual abuse trauma and have just started opening up about it. Speaking those words to anyone was the hardest thing. I now struggle talking about certain things especially my flashbacks. I have started sending my therapist emails the night before therapy to open up dialogue. He knows me so well and knows how to approach my issues to speak certain things. It’s a slow process and he doesn’t make me say anything out loud I don’t want too. However, he is slowly through my emails getting the information he needs to help me. 

Since I have started this practice of emailing, my sessions have been so much more productive. So maybe send in an email, first the fear then what the issues are. Explain you want to be able to speak those words. A good therapist will be able to get you where you want to be. They can’t if you don’t tell them and sometimes we can’t speak but we can write. Best of luck!"

As an adult you should know that you are NOT rewarded for doing basic life skills. The only reward is that it is completed. 

Now on to the major issue. How the f*ck are you going to say that because kid A is more extroverted should earn more money? That is an even bigger problem than giving the kids money in the first damn place. Stop creating entitled little shits!

I sent an email entitled “ untold story”. I have never trusted anyone in my life with this information. 

Now I can’t ever imagine life without seeing him. I see him twice a week and have been for a year.

I remember locking myself in the closet and crying all the time. I too had no one to talk too. I’m grateful to not be stuck in that situation in this crazy time. My pm’s are open if you just need a listening ear. I’m not a therapist but I definitely understand where you are. 

Music was my savior. I listened to music all the time to drown out the noise. I would bring my younger brother into my room and we would play games with music playing. Sometimes if it was not late at night we would just go outside and sit on the porch to get away. I’m not sure what you’re situation is but if you can at least get outside it will not be so loud. It sucks being the oldest trying to save your siblings. Depending on ages you can take them outside too. Be brave young man. I wish I could give better advice, but in these strange times I don’t know what else to tell you. 

Remember this too shall pass. I know you are scared. I was too. But you are not alone. Although it is not your responsibility to take of your siblings you may be their savior. That’s a huge responsibility and not fair, but one day they will thank you. I’m glad I could shield my brother from some insanity and I’m glad my older brother could shield me from some insanity. I’m not super close with either as adults but if I need anything they will always be there. We protected each other as children and we protect each other as adults. 

Also remember it’s okay to be scared. It’s okay to cry. It’s okay to reach out here or anywhere to get advice or just have someone to get all the ugly out to. Once this is all over search for therapy. 

Best of luck! 💜"
AMA,fltcz8k,t3_fqxrwg,1585467644.0,I’m sorry for your loss and I’m sending all the love your way. Stay strong dear internet stranger! I’m proud you have reached out in some way even if it’s to the random people on Reddit! When it hits remember to keep reaching out! You have a long road ahead but keep remembering the wonderful moments those car rides will live forever. 💜
TalkTherapy,fltadxp,t3_fqxgxo,1585464752.0,I would definitely try teletherapy. I know it seems terrible but to flat out stop therapy can be worse than actually doing a teletherapy session. I had my first one on Friday and before that we spoke on the phone. It’s not the same and it’s not as productive but it’s reassuring that I still get to see and talk to my therapist. I have a pretty good relationship with him and right now I’m going through a hard time. Personally if I took a break and at this point it could be a long break you might lose some momentum in your progress. Just food for thought. Hope everything works out.
abusiverelationships,flt61i4,t3_fqvutc,1585460399.0,I have been experience with cop escort. Make sure they are aware of everything you plan to take. They generally only give you 15 minutes. And call in advance so they are prepared with a cop ahead of time. You should probably file for a protection order as well. It’s a hard traumatic experience but I’m so proud of you for leaving! Good luck and stay strong!
raisedbynarcissists,flpv2i9,t3_fpxpak,1585369663.0,Yup. Teacher reported after I went to school a mess after my dad attacked me. Cos came talked to me I front of my parents. My dad the manipulator looked innocent and even sat in a wheelchair! Made the next six months hell until I left for college. Worthless. Completely worthless! I’m so sorry you are in this boat too. Stay strong!
abusiverelationships,flnr5ds,t3_fpt0y7,1585324294.0,Congratulations! It’s so hard to make the decision you’re making! I have been there! Stay strong! You can’t be evicted! Pack his shit and put it outside! You deserve better!
therapy,flmqnih,t3_fpr9gz,1585292668.0,I’m a non judgmental listening ear if you need it. I have/had a terrible relationship with my dad. I have a no contact relationship now. I have spent many therapy sessions on that very subject and I’m sure many more in the future. Stay strong 💜
datingoverthirty,flmpl4w,t3_fpjl1e,1585291492.0,"I’m feeling you! I’m only a month outside of my relationship and being in total isolation sucks! Oddly enough I’m at my ex, before this last ones, beach house and he’s here too!! Life is weird. We have been in isolation together now almost two weeks. We have become great friends which is helpful but the whole mourning process is hard. I’m not at home and in a really rough mental place. The ex I just left was a narcissist and very mentally and emotionally abusive. I have tried to keep myself busy but I find myself spending too much time online. I get stuck in nasty rabbit holes and don’t sleep. 

My advice don’t check their social media EVER!  Don’t get absorbed in looking at pictures or memories of fun or bad times. Focus on you. If you are stuck on what you did wrong that’s normal, but take that and learn. Accept your mistakes and figure out how to not make them again. Keep things positive. If you’re feeling overwhelmed in negative energy or thoughts, write them all down, it doesn’t have to be sentences or make sense just get the negative out and burn the paper. It’s very therapeutic. If you are just downing yourself because that’s what we do, start making a list of all the awesome things about yourself. Remind yourself that things fall apart and that’s okay, you have blame, it’s always a two way street, but you are still awesome. Snuggle your pup tight. Missing them in bed? Build a pillow person to help you feel like you aren’t alone. Pick up those art supplies get your emotions out through art! Missing the gym, find some old 80s workout stuff on YouTube and laugh your way through a workout! 
Reach out when it gets hard, but don’t ignore your art! I’m here if you need someone to chat with, I don’t sleep much anymore! Stay strong!"

DysfunctionalFamily,flb8p6v,t3_fnk221,1584999647.0,"No not respond. HOWEVER, definitely take a look at what she said. And really evaluate if you husband is a narcissist. She might just be angry but she could have a point. Narcissists are dangerous. Good luck."

NarcissisticAbuse,fla5iav,t3_fnic0h,1584977061.0," I’m three weeks out and the current  intense anxiety is crazy!! I feel free and loved by my support system but I still ache and wish I knew what he was doing. The breakup was nasty and we both moved out of our apartment rendering him homeless with no friends or family close. I feel bad and guilty but I know he made that situation. I hope he is okay because well I’m not a shit person. My anxiety and panic attacks have gotten insane and I have terrible nightmares all the time. 

I promise it gets better though. Just leave and stay gone. Get into therapy and work it out. Trauma bonding is a real thing and that’s why you feel the need to be close but you don’t need it! You are strong and remember you deserve better! Keep going!"
LifeAfterNarcissism,fl9twjs,t1_fl9r08i,1584969151.0,"Thank you! I do have that list for sure but it was a strong moment of weakness. Believe me I never wanna read that again. However, it was easier to let it go. I know he needed validation and has no friends to get it from. It just proves how sad of a person he really is."
LifeAfterNarcissism,fl8s6z7,t3_fnacn9,1584930996.0,"Oh I’m struggling. I literally had to go find this horrific post he made about me after we broke up and read all the terrible stuff he said to remind myself why I don’t want to talk to him. Of course that sent me into a nasty rabbit hole of terrible thoughts and I wish I hadn’t done that. 

Stay strong guys! We deserve better and breaking NC is damage we don’t deserve!"
abusiverelationships,fl8rr5o,t3_fna2yd,1584930688.0,Ouch that hurts. Truth. Absolute truth.
bipolar2,fl8655u,t3_fn4lt9,1584916680.0,"I’m right here with you! I’m in isolation at the beach in my happy place and I’m literally walking around thinking how horrible I am and how I feel bad for the friend I’m with because they have to deal with me and can’t really leave! 

I have been doing a lot of cleaning. To distract. I have given up on friends cause they reality is a don’t have many and up until today I was with both. 

Music!!! Music helps. 

I know you’re looking for human connection. Me too feel free to pm me I’m just busy hating myself here at the Outer Banks. 

Stay strong! Think about how awesome you are, I know the struggle but I’m absolutely positive you are awesome!"
therapy,fl85c3y,t1_fl8580s,1584916197.0,Thanks! I need to hear that! 💜
therapy,fl854z4,t1_fl2slmn,1584916078.0,"Thank you! We chatted on the phone Friday and I said something about being really dependent recently and he didn’t even acknowledge it and moved on to more important things. I’m taking that in a positive because he’s sassy like that. 

Trauma work is exhausting and the hardest thing I have ever done in my life. I’m trying hard to be kind with myself but I struggle with that. Thank you for reminding me that it’s okay and to be kind!"
NarcissisticAbuse,fl84kwe,t1_fl6av59,1584915745.0,"Thanks! It was heartbreaking when I found it and read all the terrible things people were saying about me. I guess what hurt the most was what my nex said. I have since accepted he needed that validation to make himself feel better. He left me a broken person who felt dead inside. Today, I’m still struggling with a lot of anxiety but I’m free and I’m not constantly belittled and judged. 

You are right there are always two sides of the story and the truth lies somewhere in the middle. I certainly am not a perfect person but I never intentionally hurt him and I always accepted my behavior and apologized when I was a bitch. I of course don’t need to be validated and have had a hard time actually opening up about my experience and struggle in therapy to heal. One day though I’ll be stronger than ever and more aware of myself and what I want and deserve in life. 

Have a wonderful life and stay strong!"
LifeAfterNarcissism,fl7j7a1,t3_fn3qrt,1584902845.0,I had horrible nightmares about my nex last night! It hasn’t been long since our breakup and nc but my nightmares have gotten worse lately. My nex was really horrid about my medical issues and wouldn’t come with me to the doctors for any reason even if I couldn’t drive myself. My dreams were about him going with me but the constant stream of berating and belittling made me wake up sobbing. I wish they would stop. I don’t know why they keep occurring. I’m sorry they are still happening after a long time. Best of luck!!
bipolar,fl610bd,t3_fmoxtv,1584851105.0,This is everything!
NarcissisticAbuse,fl60u12,t3_fmsi8c,1584850966.0,My ex called me the narcissist!!! Said I was the psycho. Literally went on reddit and wrote this huge crazy post about how I was insane and he was the victim and got all kinds of sympathy and everyone called me horrible things and it made him feel validated. They do that because truly they don’t see themselves as wrong so it has to be you. Brush it off and keep going. If you’re still with them get away now! You’ll feel better in the end. I do!!
RBNSpouses,fl5odsx,t3_fmqzao,1584841626.0,Open communication is key. I just got out of a very toxic relationship and I have a lot of past trauma from before them. I wasn’t honest with my ex because I wasn’t comfortable. I now know that although the relationship was toxic I could have saved myself a lot of trauma and tears and creating more trauma by being honest. If you don’t trust your partner to be honest about what’s happening with you then you have a bigger problems.
therapy,fl1qg20,t3_fm1d5r,1584734180.0,"What kind of worksheet? It might be away for them to get an idea of what’s going on? I’ve never been given a worksheet. I just spent 40 minutes on the phone with my therapist talking about anxiety and working through what’s going on in my head. Also, online therapy is way different than actual talk therapy. Maybe try seeing someone instead of spending ridiculous money online."
DysfunctionalFamily,fkympyj,t3_flhaxe,1584651821.0,"Stay strong. Don’t give up! Times are hard now but they won’t always be that way. One day you will leave and have a beautiful life. I’ve been there and I understand. Please know you have the power to make it better. I’m unsure how old you are but make an exit strategy, do one thing a day. You can do this."
LifeAfterNarcissism,fkjl0zi,t3_filq18,1584249279.0,"True story. My nex and I broke up two weeks ago. Mutual agreement. However, he wanted me to leave in 7 days. I panicked, cause who wouldn’t. I also have several chronic illnesses that prevent me from working and I’m in the middle of applying for disability and in that process you can’t be employed at all. On top of that I’m a full time student. So once I calmed down and realized I was on the lease too, I could take the time I needed. He got all pissy cause it wasn’t what he wanted and moved out taking just a few items, two days before the first. Of course I had to move because I couldn’t afford the rent. Moral of the story tread carefully. I have zero advice except, nothing is too low for them to pull. They will lie, cheap, and scheme their way around. Best of luck!"
TwoXSex,fk6i08l,t3_fgph5j,1583902730.0,I had to have a hysterectomy at a very young age (32) and after that my hormones were all messed up. I couldn’t get wet either. Finally talked with my gynecologist and he gave me a cream to use. I haven’t tried it yet 😔 but I also started hormone therapy which has helped a lot! So talk to your doc there are options. You aren’t a freak! Best of luck!
LifeAfterNarcissism,fk6fvys,t3_ff1gsq,1583901024.0,"Thank you! I’m trying hard to stop the guilt, but blaming my actions on them seems wrong. I still acted in away I feel shame. That was me still... tons more therapy in my future."
NarcissisticAbuse,fk2c1j2,t3_ffxp9c,1583797673.0,Yes! Sometimes I wondered why I was even present for the “conversation “ I never really got to speak and when I did heaven forbid they not like what I had to say.

therapy,fjwsvh0,t1_fjwq7dd,1583644979.0,I think you might need to find the right therapist. Mine is beyond wonderful! He always calls back even after working hours and talks me through moments until he feels it’s okay to let me go. I see him twice a week and I never feel like he’s there for the paycheck. I don’t see someone in a private practice but through a medical facility. That could be the difference. It took me years to find the right fit and took me two years with him to get to a place where I’m really comfortable. If you want the help it’s there and genuine. Keep trying but do it in person and stay positive!

You aren’t crazy. Don’t listen to his insanity. I know why you sent the message but honestly to a narc it means nothing. It’s only an invitation to continue the abuse. 

Stay strong. Continue nc. It hurts. It sucks. Stay strong you’ll feel better. It may always hurt a little bit but you’re free!"
LifeAfterNarcissism,fjugefk,t3_few5yr,1583616538.0,"I have now dated two narcs. I’m desperately attracted to them. It’s on the quick list on therapy topics. 

Learning to recognize the signs don’t turn red flags a different color and move on. Listen to yourself. Don’t move to fast. Listen to friends and family. Stay centered. Therapy. But most importantly listen to yourself. You will know quick you just have to listen. 

Stay strong. Best of luck."
therapy,fjue0e9,t3_fezluw,1583615963.0,"It took my two years to get comfortable. I’m still struggling with full honesty but I figure it’s a slow process. 

Make sure you are trying every session and if you aren’t getting a little better maybe try a different therapist you click with better. My therapist has been wonderful for me and recently I have gone through some nasty stuff. I have called multiple times in the past two months and he has always called me back and talked me through those moments. I have had emergency appointments and sessions where I just cry and talk in circles. 

Honesty is crucial. I’m afraid and full of shame with my inner most thoughts and past actions. But slowly I talk about them and not once has he ever judged me. Complete full support. I think I’ve shocked him but still no judgement. 

Open up. Free yourself. Don’t be afraid to find someone you click with. Having a healthy relationship is the key to success! Best of luck!"
Fibromyalgia,fjtv0bt,t3_few5mu,1583611170.0,"Every frickin day! I’m always second guessing if I’m just a whiner! But the reality is the pain is real and it isn’t normal. My good days are less and less now and I haven’t had a pain free day in a long time. I’m tired all the time and I just wish I could wake up feeling rested and ready to go. I wish I could work and be a productive human being in society. I can’t and that hurts more than anything.

We are willing to overlook things in the moment and don’t even see the abuse until you completely exit a situation. 

I personally just left a very mentally and emotionally abusive relationship last week. Now as I’m free and coming out of the survival mode, I’m seeing all the signs, red flags, and “deal breakers” I let slide. 

Stay strong, learn your lesson and keep on keeping on. Best of luck!"

Although I prefer not to call it treatment it sounds like you can “fix” it. Bipolar can’t be fixed. It’s a chemical imbalance in the brain. Just because someone is diagnosed bipolar doesn’t mean they can be a fully functioning human being. We hold jobs, have families, hobbies, do everything anyone not bipolar can do. The chemicals in the brain just don’t function properly. 
I’m a highly functioning person and I happen to be bipolar."
