You're not too old. I roomed with an 18 year old last year and the age gap was nothing except I was the one buying alcohol. 


Get that degree. Experience college. Immerse yourself with campus life (if your campus is open and it's safe in the fall). Don't be embarrassed. 


It took my brother four years to get his associates. He's still in his apprenticeship at 25.

Hell, my boyfriend is 26, he's planning on going back for his master's, but not until he's 30. He's going to be 30, back on a college campus, and no one will even notice. And you know what he's going to do? I will bet money he joins a Dungeons and Dragons club. At 30 for his masters. 


My grandma always tells me that she wishes she stopped caring about what other people thought when she was my age. My aunt went back to school and changed her entire CAREER path at 40 from fashion design to counselor and went back to school.

BipolarReddit,foxtkuf,t3_ga49ve,1588155822.0,"Alrighty, take a deep breath haha. I can't diagnose you, none of us can. 

As for what causes bipolar, no. Its a mixture of biological genes and social effects. Like for me, I'm the only one in my family who has bipolar disorder. Now, the genes can be passed down and activated without anything happening, or can lay dormant until something happens. The jury is really out on that.

Multiple illnesses is incredibly common. I'm bipolar, have an anxiety disorder, PTSD, and ADD. ADD seems to be the most common disorder that goes along with bipolar, but its not always. It depends on the person. 

As for manic episodes, they can just last a day, and then the next day you can be depressed as hell. Its called rapid cycling. I can't remember if thats Bipolar 1 or Bipolar 2, but one is more likely to have longer phases while the other has shorter phases. 

Mania is scary, but don't you ever EVER lie to anyone struggling with a mental illness and pretend that you're struggling with the same thing. Thats just wrong and disrespectful. 

Mania kinda allows your brain to go all hay wire, and you act out. You do crazy shit. It's normal, and it can be very dangerous. Self medicating with alcohol and drugs is incredibly common, I know you said that you don't do either, but that doesn't mean in the future at college you're not going to try anything. 

Do you have a therapist? Do you see a psychiatrist? You need a psychiatrist for bipolar meds, they know psychiatric medications more than general doctors do, and they have access to a wider range of medications. The most important thing is to stay treatment compliant: go to your therapy appointments, go to your psych appointments, and take your meds regularly.

You're being gas lighted, dude. None of this is your fault. I relate to you and understand. It's hard to leave someone that you love deeply, however you need to look out for yourself first. 

I worked with One Love for a while (a domestic abuse awareness charity) and she's laying out every single sign of domestic abuse (if the slap wasn't enough).

- she's physically hurt you before

- you stated that she sometimes blames her hitting you on your behavior

- she needs to be placed first in the sense of being cared for so that she has control over your time and devotion to her

- a friend/family member has denounced your relationship and does not agree or support you two

- she is isolating you from the outside world 

This are just some points. 

Do not tell her that your mom doesn't like her, she will take this and use it to force you to comfort her and be affectionate more with her and isolate you from your mom. This is what I did before I got involved with One Love, and it made everything worse for me. Learn from my mistake. 

She won't change without her being actively aware of her problem (which she seems that she isn't), and she seems to be incredibly manipulative to the point where not just you needed to calm her down, but so did your parents. 

The saying is: if they will slap you, they will punch you; if they punch you, they will shove you; if they shove you, they will beat you; if they beat you, they will kill you.

Domestic abuse escalates until the victim breaks the cycle. Break the cycle for your safety, break the cycle for your happiness and life. 

Document all physical injuries with pictures, take your parents with you to court and get a restraining order. Typically filing a restraining order is free, and you don't NEED a lawyer. Your parents testifying and any pictures should be enough for a restraining order. Then she has to leave your apartment without you breaking lease or penalty to you (if she's on the lease). The police serve the restraining order, so she can't attack you when she gets it. 

It's time to break up. You know this in your heart or else you wouldn't have posted this. I wish you all the luck in the world, if you have any questions please feel free to reach out!"

What you wrote, I saw. I nearly did the exact same things if not all of those, and maintained a great gpa so no one at school really batted an eye to my behavior and my parents had given up (not on me, they NEVER gave up on me, they just gave up on punishing me because at least I had college in mind and had school sorted out). 

Impulse control, rebellious behavior (outside the normal realm of angsty teen), self medication; these are all things that are going to need a therapist. 

Im not saying she's bipolar, I can't diagnose anyone, but something else is at play here. 

What I needed, and what my parents figured out I needed, was them to be gentle. They were gentle through everything, and trust me I put them through hell. What ended up happening was I was (and I don't want to freak you out here) cutting myself and I think my mom knew, but she never said anything directly to me. She waited for me to come to her. But in the meantime, she did come with me to the doctor for some BS appointment for a ""check up"" she scheduled and in that appointment she asked about therapy and what kind of resources my network had for people my age (15 at the time). I definitely felt attacked, but what are you going to do at the doctor's office? So I sat and listened, and I let it mull in my head when I went to my room and locked my parents out so I could go and do whatever. 

Eventually I came to my parents via text and said, ""I need help. I'm hurting myself, I want to die daily, I need help"" and the appointment was made. 

I've been with my therapist for nearly eight years now and he diagnosed me with anxiety, bipolar disorder, ADD, and PTSD. 

Do not give up on your daughter. Blatantly tell her this. ""I will not give up on you"". Bring up therapy once or twice, let her pick a therapist and let her make the decisions on therapy. She needs to be in control of therapy and recovery. Assure her that you will never call the therapist, you are not legally allowed to have any access to her therapy records. You aren't, that's not bullshit. 

From the deepest part of my heart, try your hardest to bond with her. Don't look at it as a reward, even if she's grounded (I'm not sure how grounding works we never used that in my household). Ask her to watch a movie, send her Karen memes, cook together, take her out to dinner, take her shopping. Don't put pressure on her, but offer these outings to her, she needs to be safe with you.

I saw that she doesn't like you complimenting her, is she eating okay? Do you find her spending a lot of time in the bathroom after meals? Does she eat alone a lot? 

Be gentle, you already have shown to us that you care, your daughter is scared and confused. Don't yell at her, talk to her like an adult. It's going to be okay. PM me if you have any questions or need any support"
