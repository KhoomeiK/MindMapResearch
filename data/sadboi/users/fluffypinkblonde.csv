Some dude who was working at the stall I was hiding behind came to see if I was okay but he spoke no English, and like the heathen Brit I am, I basically only speak English. Dude managed to ask if I was ok and told me to wait a sec and came back with an enormous slice of chocolate cake. I sat and cried and ate my cake and was all fixed. Dude knew just what to do."
