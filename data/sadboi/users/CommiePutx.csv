tarot,fjaz6pd,t3_fbt91g,1583183393.0,"I asked the cards what I should focus on in the coming month.

I have a lot of things to overcome this coming month. Including a delicate and precarious housing situation along with hopping around the greater metropolitan area with my dog.

I use the Midnight Edition of The Wanderer’s Tarot.
The Courts have been reorganized with the intention to disrupt gender and other structural hierarchies in place in the traditional naming of the courts.

The Wanderer's court titles are Philosopher (Page), Goddess (Queen), Prophet (King), and Wanderer (Knight) for whom the deck is named for. In this deck, it is the Wanderer who experiences the fullness of life.

The suits have been revisioned to ground the reader in the natural world. The Moons, Stones, Feathers, and Knives correspond to the traditionally Cups, Pentacles, Wands, and Swords, respectively.

Here’s my spread, I’d love to see what you folks think.
