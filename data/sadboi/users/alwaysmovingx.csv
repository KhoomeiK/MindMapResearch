Codependency,fk6egp0,t3_ferk56,1583899957.0,"Hey,

Thanks for posting, I‚Äôm 25F and have had a few long term relationships since college and I have always been like this.

It is a horrible feeling, to literally have your whole day go from decently okay to all of a sudden the end of the world because the person you‚Äôre dating isn‚Äôt responding, or has made other plans, or whatever. It‚Äôs like this huge rejection that makes you feel SO unworthy and you don‚Äôt even want to do anything with anyone else, so then it exacerbated the feeling of being unworthy and sad.

Fuck I hate this cycle too. I am sorry you‚Äôre going through this but this subreddit has made me more aware of ‚Äî just like you said ‚Äî that this is NOT my *supposed* insufficiency but my codependency patterns at play. It‚Äôs a way of relating to other people and it‚Äôs almost like we take any no so personally that our self esteem takes a hit every time it happens.

I‚Äôve broken up with people out of panic in the past. One boyfriend I had in college was honestly one of the best I‚Äôve had and I literally broke up with him driving home from his family‚Äôs thanksgiving dinner. It was ONLY because I ‚Äúfelt like he was acting different and didn‚Äôt give me enough attention in the past month‚Äù. I mean the timing was just horrendous and selfish and just... ugh. It‚Äôs heartbreaking.

Recently, I‚Äôve been seeing a guy from work and we have fun together and it‚Äôs been casual but I CAN‚ÄôT DO CASUAL. I get SO attached and when he (like this weekend) hasn‚Äôt texted me AT ALL or asked about my moving situation I feel like he is completely rejecting me and will never talk to me again... and we aren‚Äôt even in an official relationship.

The anxiety takes a toll. I am going to try to sleep tonight with a meditation podcast or something."
dating_advice,fk5fuq4,t1_fk5euov,1583879647.0,"So the context was ‚Äî I was having a horrible pest problem in my apartment and asked him last Thursday to stay over, he replied and said I could but he was in a different town and would be back later. So then I replied (but it went through as a text message instead of Imessage) asking if he was home. No response. And I‚Äôve texted him the day after and on Saturday and all went through as green texts.

So basically I think he‚Äôs not receiving my texts. I don‚Äôt think texting again is the solution since clearly they aren‚Äôt going through.

Wouldn‚Äôt he have said something at work if he was wondering?"

I also relate so much to knowing I used to be so motivated and goal-driven and now it‚Äôs like, where are my goals? What do I want to do? Why aren‚Äôt I excited about life and the opportunities that lie ahead?

I loved therapy. Right after my breakup I was literally going 2x per week I was such a mess. Living at home w/ my parents working in retail. I felt like a loser. Long story short, I ended up going back on antidepressants (I was on one in college for half of the four years). And they helped a lot. Then after I felt good I went off them. 

Then, i moved across country for a job that again did market layoffs (they were a bad startup. So poor decision on my part) and then I was left in Texas trying to figure out what to do. I once again got depressed and started meds again. They helped, then I went off. 

Now, it‚Äôs been about 9 months in my current job and I love my coworkers but don‚Äôt like my job. I am not challenged at all and I‚Äôm almost embarrassed at what I do, especially after attending a top 10 university. I‚Äôve joe started antidepressants again.

What I‚Äôm saying is, I realized that I am just depressed and I need to stay on meds. It‚Äôs such a hard realization but when I look back at the times I was on them compared to not, I am a different person. I at least have some hope, I can make goals for myself and have more confidence to go out and meet people.

This may not be exactly for you - take what you want and leave the rest, but it was what helped me.  Coming to the realization that my brain is just a little different and needs some help.

Rooting for you, you got this."

Education: bachelors degree awarded in 2017 from a top 10 public university in nutrition. GPA: 3.56 (organic chem killed me...)

GRE: I believe 155 Verbal and 150 Quant and a 4.5 writing. (Have to double check this) 

Work experience: worked for a large hospital system in an HR type role doing worksite wellness / wellness programming for employees. I loved it but wanted more depth and influence. Then, I moved to a tech heavy city and have worked at one hyper growth startup in marketing and one in customer care.

Research: not much besides a small research project at my university regarding behavior change in university students. wasn‚Äôt super involved though and I regret it

I graduated from a top 10 public university in 2017 with a degree in nutrition. Realized I did not want to do nutrition counseling so I went into worksite wellness. Loved that, applied for MPH school and then decided against it knowing that wasn‚Äôt really the route I wanted.

Fast forward to now, I kind of had my quarter life crisis and moved to Austin Texas (I do not like it here and am planning on moving) to get my foot in the door in health tech. I am working in customer care for a health tech company now but am really wanting to move more into IO psychology to work in consulting. For reference, my company now doesn‚Äôt even have an HR Department, and I am seeing all of the detrimental effects on employees.

I‚Äôve always had a strong interest in psychology and realized IO would be my best option due to my career goals and not wanting to go into counseling.

TLDR: should I try to find an entry level job in HR, then apply for a masters program? Or, since I have about ~2 years of work experience can I apply now if I have my GRE scores? 

Also, what is the job outlook?

Since I was 16 I‚Äôve had a boyfriend. My energies and thoughts and actions were all directed toward whoever I was with and I pretty much neglected myself for years. All of my relationships were very long term (2ish years) and so I was very invested emotionally in each one.

I have now been single for a year after my last breakup and this is the longest I‚Äôve ever been single. I‚Äôve also moved to a new city and I have felt the same fears and discomfort as you. I don‚Äôt have someone to unload all my emotions into or pour my love over so essentially it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm ‚Äústuck‚Äù learning how to love myself and build up WHO I AM without any man in my life.

I hear you. It‚Äôs scary af. When you‚Äôve built who you are around someone else and then they‚Äôre gone you‚Äôre left feeling almost like an empty shell of yourself.

To notice this codependent behavior at our young age of 24 is honestly a blessing. Some people never address it and get stuck in this cycle their whole life. I actually see it in my mom, which is sad.

Anyway, yes I keep a journal and I go to therapy. I am more aware of how I am relating to people in relationships. I am learning about toxic shame and why I maybe don‚Äôt want to create a firm sense of self ‚Äî and for me it‚Äôs because growing up I was bullied for being overweight and I always felt like an outcast.

Then something awful happened in my life and I got mad, I moved from that town and back to my hometown and realized I felt that I was, too, in a cult. It‚Äôs that ‚Äúgroup think‚Äù mentality. And also, most people from my college town church have never left, so it‚Äôs like they‚Äôve never experienced ‚Äúthe world‚Äù.

Months later I moved far away across the US to be near my sister. I started partying a lot, which was fun for a little while, but realized my life wasn‚Äôt as joyful as it was before. In my new city, I haven‚Äôt ‚Äúplugged in‚Äù to a church because I was SO against it and wanted to live life on MY terms and not listen to some God who I feel like ‚Äúallowed‚Äù that bad thing to happen.

Well, let me just say that I recently started going back to church. I felt lost tbh and I get why you‚Äôre frustrated with people saying ‚Äúpray about it‚Äù but I think what I‚Äôve learned is when you pray about something you want/need, your attention is THERE. And there‚Äôs that saying ‚Äúwhat you focus on expands‚Äù...

I guess I identify as a Christian but I also am more progressive and believe that all spirituality is connected in some way. If you need a new opportunity for work, for example, when you ‚Äúpray‚Äù about it, you‚Äôre focusing your energy there, or, other people would say ‚Äúmanifest‚Äù it. Same thing, kinda.

I often get scared thinking about when my parents pass, honestly. I call them TOO frequently when I am going through some sort of a crisis (even if it is just something so minuscule that I just can‚Äôt handle) and to think one day they won‚Äôt be there is terrifying, 

Which is why I am in therapy. Lol."

It‚Äôs been 1 year since the discard and it‚Äôs just honestly sad, like I look back and miss how I felt when I was w him. NOT HIM, but just how carefree I felt..."

careerguidance,etn0zbw,t1_etn0fbf,1562973728.0,"Lol, yeah, but this generation has so much pressure to get it all right the first try, which makes it kind of hard to be content with wherever you are in life at the time :/"
careerguidance,etn0x74,t1_etn00mk,1562973682.0,"Of course, i also likes knowing there‚Äôs people out there with my same issue and struggle knowing I‚Äôm not alone lol.

I think that‚Äôs what is so hard, when you‚Äôre super passionate and looking at the ‚Äúlast rung of the ladder‚Äù and ultimately where you wanna be, but not knowing what step to take first.

I have worked with a coach in the past, which, I know is not feasible for some. I‚Äôd be willing to help you discover your skills/strengths if you wanna DM me!!!"
dietetics,etmztfq,t3_cci1e8,1562972838.0,"So I‚Äôm not an RD but did the undergrad DPD program to prepare me for this.

I‚Äôll say if you want to be in integrative med, try just going for PA school.  I‚Äôm considering this now. I didn‚Äôt get my RD bc working for a year for free and taking out more loans did not make sense for me...

I have heard RDs do not get much respect and also have a limited scope of practice, so always keep that in mind too"
careerguidance,etmzktd,t3_cchwgk,1562972657.0,"Can‚Äôt wait to chime in on this!!!

So I am in your position, haven‚Äôt figured it out. I‚Äôm 24 and I‚Äôve been asking the same question.

So I agree with the first poster. I think trying things out and not being afraid of making a ‚Äúwrong‚Äù decision is good. I almost went to grad school as a cop out - for real - because I didn‚Äôt know what I wanted to do, and I just figured going into Public Health would make sense after getting a degree in nutrition.

BUT my curiosity and strategic mind came into play and told me not to ‚Äî just yet. I tried out working for a startup! It was a lot of work, and I learned a good amount about entrepreneurship, but ultimately they did layoffs.

Now I am in the process of figuring out my next step.

Do I want to go to grad school? Yeah, most likely eventually. Do I have a clear idea of what yet? Not quite.

Take your time. Don‚Äôt put so much pressure on yourself (I have to tell myself on the daily!) and enjoy your younger years ya know?"
NarcissisticAbuse,etmq7x1,t3_ccg14v,1562965865.0,"My nex messaged all my ex boyfriends and guy friends and told them to get their ‚Äúdirty hands off me‚Äù because I was a ‚Äúbeautiful woman who doesn‚Äôt deserve this‚Äù but then smeared ME to all my mentors and MY friends telling them that I was ‚Äúbeing promiscuous and finding out that I slept with all these guys‚Äù and that they need to help me go through this ‚Äútough time in my life‚Äù


So fucking stupid."
careerguidance,etmq265,t3_ccg20o,1562965751.0,Good question and id like to know as well lol
careerguidance,etmpzvc,t1_etmn7fc,1562965706.0,"Very sound advice. Despite struggling right now figuring out my what job I can get to pay my bills, I don‚Äôt regret withdrawing from grad school to figure it out more clearly, otherwise I would have racked up close to 120K in debt,"
depression,etmjcub,t1_etmiyk1,1562961248.0,"Wow thank you for being so open about this. Yeah it for real is a struggle, I envy my peers who are content with doing any career bc they know they need to work at it. Here I am with this huge ego for no reason and can‚Äôt learn to work hard for things, expecting life will be easy bc my parents made it that way. üôÑüôÑ"
depression,etmiyli,t1_etmihiv,1562960989.0,"Yes I totally resonate with this.
It‚Äôs like I have drive to be successful, but I don‚Äôt have drive to take the necessary steps to get there ‚Äî if that makes sense???

Like they did. You‚Äôre right they had to work hard af for things, and it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm just not willing to do it, even though I know that‚Äôs the only way to success"

I made a post yesterday about making my bed but (of course) that only lasted one day. I really want to make these habits last longer so at least my physical environment is cleared up when my head isn‚Äôt"
careerguidance,etlwat3,t3_cccij5,1562946750.0,"I‚Äôm in the same boat. Got a degree in nutrition and wanted to pursue some other degree to help others but no money and it would have  put me in so much debt.

From what I have heard, people say don‚Äôt rush to grad school. Work and see if you like anything else and if not, go back eventually. But I‚Äôm also struggling and feel like school is the only option"

depression,etlrbr1,t3_ccaxvm,1562943565.0,"I feel you on this. I was always the most ambitious girl in school, straight A‚Äôs involved in every club, in college I had a hard time with classes like Organic chem but I still made it through and was relatively happy.

Now at 24 I feel the same way as you. I‚Äôm thankful I have a dog, but the days just get so monontonius. I never thought this would happen.

One of my biggest things is that I feel overwhelmed by life, not knowing what career to take, how to organize my life in terms of paying bills, etc, it sucks,

I partially ‚Äúblame‚Äù my parents because they did everything for me up until I moved out for college and even during that time still did a LOT for me. I know people have this view of their generation how they ‚Äúscrewed‚Äù our generation and I kind of believe it but I also do love them very much and know that they did the best with what they had/known"
