She's an animal, it's not her fault she exists, and it's not like she'll be a part of my life forever.

Hard as it can be, find other outlets for your emotions. Treat your brother's cat well. He loves it and must be really upset by the fact that he can't take care of it and is leaving it up to you, who already has a lot of their plate.

I'm really sorry to hear you had such bad experiences with the health system and stuff. :/ It can be horrible sometimes. But the truth is, men and boys can still have eating disorders. I've met a lot of them. You just have to know where to look, really.

And just like with anyone, health matters a lot more than looks for men. Heavily restricting can be just as unhealthy as being very overweight, sometimes. No matter what size or shape you are, you look just right, and you deserve to be able to love yourself.

I really hope you find a way to recover, OP. Good luck with everything, and know that you're not alone out there. Stay safe."
