Same thing as you -“Tracking received. Shipment not yet picked up by DHL”. Superbuy agent says stuck in customs  and it can take up to 2 months. 

Finally, FINALLY, on 12/26 tracking page says something different - “Please contact DHL”. They tell me that it’s in Hong Kong customs since 12/17 and will be released up to 45 days. This is also now reflected in the tracking page. 

So I don’t think that Superbuy is bullshitting us. We just got unlucky man. Hopefully there’s still a chance. I hear it’s better for it to be held in HK than in the receiving country’s customs.
