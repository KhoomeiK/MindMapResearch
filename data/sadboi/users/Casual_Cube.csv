Because I always heard that chocolate melts at human body temp (\~37C).  
If so, then handling it while crafting would be a real pain in the ass no? Or do they just work in a really cold room the entire time? But that doesn't seem feasible or realistic for post production of such an item like delivering it to a client or using it for display for some time.

I was a brunt force gamer and my solution was always ""get stronger"", ""better equipment"" etc. That was my mentality until DS3, my first soulsborne game. and By GOD it was amazing and opened my eyes. 

Mainly it was getting tactical and improving myself as a player rather than my save file. Something CSGO taught me but for Combat Games and not mouse flicking. The second was the term Cheese and being tactical/critical of challenges. DS series is a prime example of this as many of you can agree. The last is my general approach to analyzing my enemies and situations (a little more than just being critical). Where I could ""see"" my enemies movements clearly now. I noticed this when I went back to Witcher 3 and saw how ridiculously easy the game felt after the Souls treatment. This effect continued onto many other games and it was amazing that one game series had such a huge impact as opposed to any other game. CS taught me a lot in shooters but what DS taught me heavily outweighs any of that. and I love it all the more for it."

Also are you on official or unofficial? Do you have access to S+ Nanny engram?"
ARK,ff8ncqg,t1_ff8j6pz,1579687205.0,"Its definitely doable. Heres how. - You convert a normal dino into a tek to breed with the other tek.  
Start by leaving some scrap metal to cook and crafting polymer and electronics.  
Feed Biotoxin to a normal dino (that has a tek version) that you need to convert to Tek. Depending on the level you need to feed a bunch. I think theres a calculator out there for this, ""try tek dino convert calculator"" or something along those lines.   
Once you know for sure you fed the right amount (you can go over just dont be under), then it should have passed out. (need to do this fast and near a transmitter/Obi). Then upload polymer (not organic) and electronics to a tek transmitter (not sure if this works with the obi) and upload the dino as well at least 30sec-1min after.   
The Dino can be done from transmitters or obis, doesn't matter. Then you need to smelt a stack of scrap metal before the items you uploaded expire. Keep it in your ""zero slot"".  
 I don't know how much you'll need exactly for the conversion but a stack will make sure anything upto like 400 level will be doable. 

Then be ready the next day for the timer. It will need to be timed right so be careful. The materials uploaded have a ""window"" after it expires in the transmitter. The window takes place because within the next 30 seconds and you need to download the dino from the obi who will be passed out still, and feed it the scrap metal from the 0 slot quickly (idk but it works) and upload it back fast. It only asks for a few and there is no cooldown so it'll keep eating rapidly from your hand.   
When you fed enough, it will say ""Somethings happening"" instead of ""press E to feed"".

Quickly upload it back and wait until the next worldsave which can be around 20 minutes usually. Now when you check the uploaded creatures, you can see a tek version of the exact dino with the same stats and levels instead. Don't know why WC made it so complicated but atleast we know how it works. 

Hope this helped! Good Luck!"
