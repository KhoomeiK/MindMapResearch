BipolarReddit,f6xkr6x,t1_f6vu3q7,1573251581.0,"Exactly! I once sorta yelled at (scolded?) a guy on the hotline because he literally sounded like he was flipping through a book and was just reading statements. I was like hi, I can hear you scrambling with your manual, can you just talk to me like a real person or are you just going to say some generic robotic bullshit?"

I understand the feeling of everything going to shit after one thing happens and derails the positive flow, but I promise that it'll be better in the long run for you to just withdraw.  Take it from someone who fell into a depressive episode, didn't withdraw from the failing class, and subsequently tanked her GPA and needed to take a summer class in order to graduate because she was short 3 credits from failing said course!"

Invisalign,f2ghe9j,t1_f2dreod,1570230629.0,"I wasn't established with a dentist prior to the orthodontics unfortunately. I wish I had gone to an office that did both, honestly.

I'm not sure what the deal was with the initial treatment plan. When I was given the rundown and the clincheck, all seemed well and good. However, now that I'm at the end, my results are NOT what the clincheck showed. It's not awful, but it's not spectacular lol.

I'm on the full plan. I didn't even know lite was an option, but I know I'd need the full regardless...my teeth were pretty crooked and crowded. My ortho didn't seem disinterested, but I just feel like I was written off a bit.

I've talked with a bunch of people at work who have had braces about retainers and the majority of them got the permanent ones, but my ortho and dentist were both kinda against that. I get that because of the possible plaque issues and whatnot, but I'm also concerned with needing additional retainers throughout my life and what that could cost... Especially if insurance doesn't cover orthodontia? I don't know, lol. I need to call my dental insurance to figure that out."

She lives in the Chicagoland area and in a heavily Korean-populated community, but I know that's not the same.  I just want her to be comfortable and happy as she gets older!"
