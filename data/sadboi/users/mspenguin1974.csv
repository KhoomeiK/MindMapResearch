You are absolutely right that he is being controlling. I'm so sorry your mom is afraid to stand up for herself, but am very glad you are able to recognize abusive behavior.  

I recommend reading up on narcissistic abuse and keep telling your mom you love her and support her. Could she be afraid to leave him because she thinks it will hurt you? Maybe if she knows that you would choose to go with her and that seeing her leave an abusive marriage would make you happy it might give her the strength she needs."
