He interrupted another party and unwrapped the presents, but he didn't break them.  Maybe pull him out of the party to rewrap the presents and apologize to the little girl.  There really is no best outcome here - assuming he is a good kid, he is going to have a hard time enjoying the rest of the party knowing he messed up in such a big way, but cancelling it allows him to transfer that anger onto you for ruining his party.  Definitely need to have a big discussion about how everyone messes up, how to make good choices under peer pressure, how to avoid temptation, etc.  Maybe send an apology card to the venue to forward to the family.
