ent,fr3f9wf,t1_fr35eb3,1589856159.0,Sorry just saw your second comment after I replied. Definitely would consider seeing GI.
ent,fr3f1k3,t3_gkpnh0,1589856019.0,"Sore throats can be caused by allergies at times and allergies can be present without obvious symptoms. Could try allergy management with nasal steroid such as flonase or nasonex (both OTC). Use daily for at least 6 weeks to evaluate for benefit. 

Have you seen GI by chance?"
ent,fqvjz01,t3_gkpnh0,1589678899.0,"Have you tried allergy management? Did they do a flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy? Sometimes sore throats can be from LPR (which you’ve ruled out) or allergies from post nasal drip. Seems likely given you had chronic tonsillitis, which is often made worse by allergies and PND."

datingoverthirty,fmipl7t,t1_fmiled2,1586114325.0,Good luck! :)
datingoverthirty,fmidgax,t1_fmi9ywz,1586107390.0,Agreed. It has to be your decision only for it to work!
datingoverthirty,fmid107,t1_fmh7rkf,1586107147.0,"That’s the plan! I had been getting back to the gym before the rona hit, but now all the gyms are closed! :("
datingoverthirty,fmicybn,t1_fmhc48f,1586107104.0,"I agree, most aren’t looking for a project in a relationship without a guaranteed outcome of success. I do think it’s easier though if you are already in a good relationship and then gain a few pounds versus going into a relationship that way. I wouldn’t think someone would leave over 15lbs, but I guess you never know!"
datingoverthirty,fmicmhb,t1_fmhk7xz,1586106912.0,So would you not even date someone if they were slightly bigger than your ideal? Do you online date? Sometimes it can be hard to tell exactly the size of someone on profiles.
datingoverthirty,fmicgv8,t1_fmhstrc,1586106821.0,"Great point! It’s obviously a subjective thing but if it’s a deal breaker for someone, then he isn’t a guy I’d want to date anyway!"
datingoverthirty,fmh6luj,t1_fmgzncd,1586068457.0,I agree. Fair question. I’ve always wondered this.
datingoverthirty,fmh66rf,t1_fmh58k2,1586068057.0,Value health and having a nice body and/or physical appearance. Sometimes people just need support to get there. Or maybe don’t know how to make those changes. I think it’s different if someone straight up says they don’t want to make changes to diet or lifestyle. Sorry if my response was confusing.
datingoverthirty,fmgi8od,t1_fmgfi08,1586049661.0,Love this! Gave me so much confidence! Thank you!
datingoverthirty,fmgi4lp,t1_fmgax3m,1586049585.0,And you are entitled to feel this way! But many others do value and can have this.. but sometimes just need a little help and support from others!
datingoverthirty,fmghqd3,t1_fmghne1,1586049323.0,Yikes that’s a lot of weight! But did you try to express that you werent as attracted along the way? To maybe encourage her to lose weight?
datingoverthirty,fmgbivl,t1_fmgbf71,1586045373.0,"That’s fair. I do agree to an extent but I think that the older I get, I tend to value personal appearance a little less. Wasn’t sure if others find the same to be true?"
sex,fmeoxez,t3_fundyv,1586010114.0,Most guys I’ve been with are on the quiet side but all moan and talk dirty when things get spicy. I have had a few that were more vocal. At first it startled me because I was used to quieter men but grew to love it because it makes me feel like they are really enjoying making whoopie!

ptsd,fbt940a,t3_edwor2,1577071695.0,"It’s just a word. I think getting upset is a negative use of energy. Not meaning to offend anyone, but honestly there are so many other things to spend time and energy on."
louisck,faubiu6,t1_farikym,1576346531.0,Yep you are right - I googled him to confirm! Thank you!
louisck,faqo1u1,t1_faqnaos,1576305720.0,Kevin Brennan is correct but it wasn’t Mike Vecchione. Thank you for your help.

ptsd,f9ej0uz,t3_e4h5p6,1575244886.0,"I am guilty of this. Sometimes I do it as a way to downplay my own problem or issue when I’m in a situation where I wouldn’t truly want to discuss it on a deeper level. For example, at work. Then coworkers will chuckle and laugh it off and move on with their days and my cover isn’t blown."
