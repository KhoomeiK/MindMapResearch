BipolarReddit,fpdqtfs,t3_gcrsy7,1588532370.0,"I’ve never heard anyone echo my experience. It’s to do with the separation of mind and body, and this may sound like selfmutilation for some. I’ve found that since early on, decades before my diagnosis, I’ve been struggling and coping in my own way. 

The ups and downs with this disease is familiar to everyone here. My take on breaking a cycle of hypomania or depression has been to “remind the mind of the body” so to speak. I’ve done downhill cycling, American football, parkour, and more martial arts than I remember. Every bruise, ache, and hurt has helped me keep myself together. I’ve utilised painful yoga (man, those veteran ladies are tough), cold showers, or just stand on my head to snap out of whatever kept me trapped inside it. I think I may understand those who cut themselves. I’ve never had the urge, but in a way the physical pain takes over and is far easier to handle than its counterpart. 

So this is a pattern I have later become aware of, straining the body as a distraction, particularly when life becomes unmanageable. It worked until I was 40 anyway. I’m middle aged now, still do karate and yoga, but these days also medications that actually give more than they take. My way is probably not for everyone, although yoga and meditation might help you too. Won’t hurt to try (much)."
