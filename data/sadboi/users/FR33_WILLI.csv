Asked her for help with hw on Snapchat and after that we kinda just kept talking. Then I invited her to a party and we had our first kiss and made it official. After around a month I realised how much happier I am when I'm with her. How bored I feel when I'm not talking to her. But the big thing was just how comfortable I was around her. That's when I realised I love her.

It made it easy yes but I think that's what assassin's creed should be. A casual hack and slash parkour game. Being able to kill over 2 dozen guards without batting an eyelid was just so satisfying to me. I'll agree that Connor was quite a boring main character and he was way too serious. But it makes sense with what happened when he was a kid.  Assassin's creed 3 was the game I was brought up on as a kid tho so I may have just a weeee bit of bias.

It might be worth asking them but take what they say with a pinch of salt. I really want you two to work things out cause it sounds like you really really do love each other.
