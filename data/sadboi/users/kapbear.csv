I feel like I need a necklace! It’s better when I tan. Bathing are hard to pick a good one because it’s so much color and cut. High necks and halter tops are fabulous i think! Try some high necked shirts. Go braless with them. It’s sexy and freeing. Try to own it!

Have you emailed career services? They can put you on a list that emails you new posting and places that need co ops. I actually did find one for summer/fall. I don’t even have a 3.0 gpa so it’s possible for you. My co op will probably be pushed back. These are really hard and weird times for everybody. Don’t blame yourself like I did. A lot of people have had co ops and internships cancelled. Just keep applying. Fall could be very different. Keep your head up

I just took linear with Hoople, he was great! He was fun and caring and laid everything out. I took circuits 2 out of RIT but we covered a lot of Linear. I’m not sure how RITs circuits 2 is. I took diff eq with an adjunct from RIT. We covered LaPlace transforms. Since you already failed I think you will have an easier time taking both of them. Try it"

You’re not going to become a new person. Your life is not going to start going downhill. You will have the same flaws, quirks, interests, and personality. With just one more experience. I was 19 with my boyfriend of a few months. I knew him for a year before and I’m still with him (I’m 21 now). I don’t regret it. I also built up sex in my head but it didn’t change anything! I’m the same person. I’m not better than anyone, I’m not in a special club. My life is the same, not better or worse. If you want to sex that’s okay! Make sure you’re safe, protected, and actually want to. There’s no rush! :)"
femalefashionadvice,fq4savw,t3_ggpm9u,1589082988.0,I agree however there is the subreddit “fashion advice” where people do ask for advice. I don’t think we need two subreddits where people post a pair of sneakers and ask what goes with them. It’s annoying. I wish there was more action there. It’s actually really fun to talk about people clothes and give advice on colors and shoes and such. What kind of advice are you looking for? I personally love having a fashion discussion subreddit for anecdotal stories about good heels and organization methods and what companies are treating employees badly. I’ve read a lot of interesting things on this subreddit. It feels very “high society” to me. Go to fashion advice and ask what color shirt to wear or where to buy something. Actually everyone go there and post pictures asking for advice.

fashionadvice,fpmkrz6,t3_ge3bxo,1588735265.0,Last year I bought shorts from American eagle. Super cute until...I washed them and the folded bottoms came unfolded. They weren’t stitched in place at all. Obviously this is a huge design flaw and I loathe AE for not putting the extra stitches to make their shorts even worth wearing BUT if you bought these shorts and unfolded them they might just give you extra length. It wasn’t my favorite style and it might not be yours either but maybe it’ll be something to try on. I also personally like Aeropostale’s shorts

I got a vibrator more recently and it actually feels better. I’m not sure what your game plan is with it, but I always wear panties when I use it. In a way it kinda distributes the feeling. I suggest trying that. It’s super powerful and almost hurts without some layer. Does yours have any settings? The pulsing is good to start with, maybe start with something lower power. You can try using your other hand to pull up and expose your head more. Spread your legs as wide as you can. Watch something stimulating. Try tensing your ab muscles that makes it quicker and better sometimes! It can give you more control and feeling. I’m going to assume you’ve tried everything and I’m sorry if this doesn’t help!

This gives you a chance to explain without jumping to conclusions about you being the one who was cheating. You’re also not just coming out and saying “I’m not cheating!” Because why should you have a guilty conscious? You found it in the textbook. You know you weren’t cheating.
