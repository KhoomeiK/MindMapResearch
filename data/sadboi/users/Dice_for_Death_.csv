I've been reading old previews of FFVII from old gaming magazines (EGM, GamePro, GamePlayers, GameFan...), catching sight of old pre-release images and screenshots.

I especially loved Hom - one of his moves was an off-button suicide (IIRC). Honestly, I go back to the soundtrack sometimes, it's just a delight to experience once and again.

The implications, man! And how it all ties back to the original, and goes beyond that, is just... wow.  My curiosity is insatiable."

There's no surprise, no opportunity to be unique; the creators would only be making shiny new presentations for familiar story beats. That's much less exciting. But, you have your opinion and I have mine. Even if I didn't like the prospect of a reimagined story, I would give it a fair shake and see what the new guard does in the stead of the old guard.

His role as Emperor came with chains, in the form of the Drahk/his ""keeper,"" more or less ruling under their whims. I like, too, that he had an inkling of what he was in for, forewarning the rest that he might seem changed after assuming his new leadership role. I want to think his learning did indeed come, but at significant cost. Just like G'kar and the epiphany that freed him of his thirst for narrowsighted vengeance.

The sooner you embrace this truth, the more flexible you'll be to yourself, and the world around you, and how you interrelate with the aforementioned. I'm not saying to discount people and the possibilities, but accept that life is imperfect, and you may want to figure out how to redefine the parameters that make life best work for you. Don't stop looking, but be aware that the ideal - perfection or the idea of a soul mate - is an formless idea that is overvalued, and more often than not may not manifest that's best for you.
