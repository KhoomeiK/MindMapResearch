I don't really know anything about you, so no advice there, but I suggest double sided tape to mount anything. I use it, and it works really well, you just have to be careful if you decide to remove anything. Your only options are to either ruin the poster or the paint, but it won't leave holes at least.

Thanks for the chance, have a nice day!"

GiftofGames,fpcxm6a,t1_fpckqlm,1588515285.0,"Pálinka is a traditional fruit brandy in Central Europe with origins in Hungary, known under several names, and invented in the Middle Ages. Protected as a geographical indication of the European Union, only fruit spirits mashed, distilled, matured and bottled in Hungary, and similar apricot spirits from four provinces of Austria can be called ""pálinka"", while ""Tótpálinka"" refers to wheat derived beverages. Törkölypál8nka, a different product in the legal sense, is a similarly protected pomace brandy that is commonly included with pálinka. While pálinka may be made of any locally grown fruit, the most common ones are plums, apricots, apples, pears, and cherries.

I recommend that you try some if you ever go to Hungary, or any neighbouring country, but look for something that's not in a big store and is at least 50% alcohol. Also, you should be able to smell the fruit if it's good quality."
