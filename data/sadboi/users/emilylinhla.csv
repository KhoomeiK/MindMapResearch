MarinaAndTheDiamonds,fr3436x,t1_fr33dh7,1589849537.0,"I‚Äôm talking production in general; Dr Luke is merely an example of exceptional producer. Electra Heart has her best commercial/chart performance by far and her YouTube videos of the songs for instance have a LOT of views. 
            
The only album IMO that has successful ‚Äúbanger‚Äù type heavy beat clubby music is Electra heart, mainly the singles Dr Luke produced. 
               
Take it this way: L+F had more similarities with the EH production than the other albums. The problem was that where EH went right with producing songs that fit with her vocals L+F stumbled so the music came across as generic and could have been sung by just anyone instead of having a mainstream sound yet covering to a consistent, unique style."

Marina doesn‚Äôt have anything on the level of ‚ÄúPrimadonna‚Äù in terms of hit power (peaked at #11 on UK charts, her highest ever - I even heard it play once on American airplay).

I'm speaking more from a commercial point of view here too. Besides the $$$ views of ""Baby"", which I actually think is a nice song with great production, the reception was a lot more lukewarm compared to other albums and on all of the Youtube comments there is always a significant amount of fans complaining about the album or saying they don't like the music anymore. This happened with Froot but definitely not to the same degree and not for the same amount of time.
              
You could also say Froot (which is a great album) didn't have the same musical variation as EH, and suffered from more ""same-ness"" underneath more cosmetic differences whereas EH had both commercial success and different musical structures that were cohered together as a concept album with a distinct style.
           
But I am biased as a musician, I really just can't get over the production on L+F. It's too sparse most of the time but the instrumental and beat come in loud and cover up the vocal with an inorganic computer sound. The acoustic versions are much better IMO."

 Back to classical: early atonal composers such as Schoenberg were working to express a high Romantic style-esque momentum and structure in their style. Atonal/polytonal music can have a wide range of emotions besides ‚Äúangry/weird‚Äù as well. 
              
Ironically, while pop music has probably cemented the major/minor split in our culture the most, it also shows some of the best musical examples in subverting the trope.

It's not the same, but Stockhausen's not purely academic and cerebral, because the way that this academic, experimental sound is expressed is not necessarily a creation of pure academia in itself and only meant to be understood within that context. In the end, it's meant to be performed by excellent musicians listened to, not merely written in a book."
classicalmusic,fppng5f,t1_fppl2nf,1588805545.0,"> He meant for his music to be challenging, and it wouldn‚Äôt be giving him his full due to say otherwise.

In what vein, as in theory? Times change, and his music became more accessible as his influence spread and it because less cutting-edge. I don't think it's possible to 100% understand his works without his sheet music and a few dozen hours, but in order to get an appreciation and love I don't think you need have more than imagination (reshaping of perception). 

That leap of faith is difficult for the vast majority of people and most musicians. I think that's probably the challenge itself. You could argue understanding the details of history and theory provoke a bigger one, but even accomplished musicians who know a lot of theory dislike his music or can't get into him because the challenge of understanding his music isn't just dissecting his sheet music. After all, Stockhausen didn't just write books on his music and leave it to the sheets, he was first and foremost making music to be listened to in conjunction to knowing the complexity.

Perhaps neither alone are successful, but I feel like amateurs and new listeners could get into this music more easily without the mindset of having to had years of music theory. I know a decent amount, but certainly not enough to know all of his work anywhere close to the way he and his students he did. 

I don't stan him and his remarks, I heard he wasn't a great person, but I don't see why the 9/11 remarks detracts from his music - I think the phrasing is edgy, but if you interpret ""beautiful"" as having completely its goal perfectly, as in ""successful,"" it makes much more sense and I think is a new way of looking at it."
classicalmusic,fppm3d6,t1_fppif7e,1588804813.0,"I agree with everything you're saying, like if you don't know what a minor versus major key is, what triple time or syncopation is, what counterpoint is and the modes used in Western music, or how themes are introduced, you're missing out on a lot if you try to listen to anything from the the classical musical canon.

The thing that bothers me is it seems taken for granted that you can listen to Bach, or even adore Bach as your favorite composer, without knowing all of the medieval Gregorian chants, Renaissance masses, counterpoint, theory proceeding him, but for experimental composers of the 20th century, there's this push for the amateur listener to learn all of the influences and environment surrounding these composers before they can understand them.

I suppose it's because I think the visceral element of his music is superior to the academic analysis of it, because why else would he keep making works exploring the same area or make Stimmung as long as it is? It has a listening quality.

I heard he said some bizarre things, but his remarks on 9/11 actually make some degree of sense to me if I understand them correctly - the religion-motivated suicide mission didn't attempt to cripple the U.S. physically, but to send a horrific emotional message. His remarks were especially controversial because he brought it up when the incident was more recent, and the phrasing was pretty edgy. I appreciate that mode of analysis, in terms of the abstract emotional high that terrorist get in their demonstrations. It is arguable they were seeing themselves as artists, performers ready for the demonstration, in some abstract way, especially because religious devotion was  the emotional engine aside from politics. 

In that sense, ""beautiful"" could mean successful, in the way that it reshaped the world at the time. Perhaps if he had said that word instead it wouldn't be controversial."

It‚Äôs funny how people who know relatively little about classical music are uptight about visuals when actual musicians don‚Äôt care about anything the acoustics unless it‚Äôs an opera, and the visual disappointment is *always* over not being able to the keyboard when it‚Äôs a pianist - or strings, etc.  
            
For instance, Yuja Wang got detained for *hours* at a Canadian airport for a (likely race-discriminatory because she‚Äôs Chinese) interrogation over something trivial. She said she looked really bad because she was crying and wore her sunglasses when she played. Some pissy elitists got worked up about it (before she said what happened). I literally would not have been able to care less, in fact that sounds like a throwback style.
            
Like, when I listen to music it‚Äôs always on my iPhone and I‚Äôm not watching any visuals. Rarely do I ever. There‚Äôs a viral video of three old Russian women looking sleepy/bored listening to a young guy playing his heart out. They‚Äôre accomplished judges and trying to sit up stiff and give full visual attention for hours and hours of rounds isn‚Äôt sustainable. But they got some hate, probably by people who‚Äôve never attended a Wagner opera before. Okay, I‚Äôve never, but I‚Äôve seen La Traviata in person, and after two hours of reading subtitles and trying to pay attention it gets old real fast, and a certain point you go ‚Äúfuck understanding what‚Äôs going on I‚Äôll just go on Wikipedia during the intermission and sit back and relax to give listening the priority (as it should always be).‚Äù"

I can‚Äôt think of any mainstream A-list classical performers who are openly members of the LGBT community. Feel free to correct me, though.

>Tchaikovsky wanted to dedicate the concerto to Iosif Kotek, but felt constrained by the gossip this would undoubtedly cause about the true nature of his relationship with the younger man.

From Wikipedia, citing some biography. Looks like there was some relationship drama... Tchaikovsky wanted to dedicate it to his boyfriend but didn‚Äôt. And Kotek helped him write the violin parts, but then didn‚Äôt even want to play it. :/
