Anxiety,fr2h91l,t1_fr2g7t9,1589837248.0,Just sent it to you!
Anxiety,fqmopkw,t3_fj2y1a,1589480959.0,"Ohio update!

Gyms and fitness centers: May 26th!

Childcare and Day Camps: May 31st!

This is pretty much putting us on track with Kentucky and Indiana right now. This should also give people hope for schools opening in the fall! Not that DeWine ever directly stated that they wouldn‚Äôt, but still.

Edit: ALSO POOLS ON THE 26TH! IN CASE YOU CAN‚ÄôT TELL I‚ÄôM REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THIS ONE"
Anxiety,fqistp6,t1_fqipd0a,1589400409.0,"This thing is starting to act more and more like SARS did (aside from lethality, of course) on a very similar timeline. Gives me a lot of hope!"
Anxiety,fqiskgi,t1_fqircnv,1589400306.0,I really hope that we‚Äôll see all of these this month! That would put us in such an awesome place come June. And hopefully the doomers will shut up by then.
Anxiety,fqhtppe,t1_fqhs2t8,1589384400.0,I sent the link to you!
Anxiety,fqhl108,t1_fqhizn6,1589379126.0,Information like this gives me a lot of hope. Especially knowing now that the first case in Ohio was traced back to January
Anxiety,fqhj4z9,t1_fqhhjsp,1589378041.0,Yes! It was really windy over the weekend. Made it feel colder than it actually was!
Anxiety,fqhcj4w,t1_fqhc69i,1589373993.0,"Thank you! My area of Ohio is FINALLY supposed to have weather in the high 70‚Äôs and 80‚Äôs starting tomorrow, and it looks like it‚Äôll stick around for awhile. I‚Äôm super excited about it!"
Anxiety,fqhbe82,t3_fj2y1a,1589373207.0,"Does anyone have any articles/pieces of information about the likelihood of this disappearing/dwindling away like SARS did in the summer? I think I‚Äôve seen some on r/LockdownSkepticism, but I feel like that sub is slowly being taken over by economic doomers so I‚Äôm trying to avoid it now."
Anxiety,fqfn1zf,t1_fqfhwax,1589327873.0,"I‚Äôve seen those too! I think it makes a lot of sense. I also saw a graph comparing day by day COVID cases to day by day SARS cases and the graph is almost following the exact same pattern. It‚Äôs extremely close. The SARS graph pretty much completely dwindles away by the end of June, so here‚Äôs hoping the pattern stays the same. I‚Äôd link the graph, but it‚Äôs from twitter so I don‚Äôt think I can."
Anxiety,fqa3dlh,t3_fj2y1a,1589212098.0,"Some local news for me, but definitely good news!

The amusement park closest to me (Kings Island) has stated that they plan to hopefully open at the end of July (no specific date yet), and plan to have hand sanitizing stations in front of each ride. Hearing this made me so excited!"
Anxiety,fptadya,t1_fpt9mj2,1588887675.0,Absolutely! It has to come to a point where everyone does what is right for themselves in order to feel better. But being closed until there‚Äôs a vaccine or until it‚Äôs ‚Äúgone‚Äù just isn‚Äôt realistic.
Anxiety,fpsnfm3,t3_fj2y1a,1588876426.0,"Good news for Ohioans!

May 15th: Nail salons, hair salons, day spas, similar businesses opening up. Also outdoor dining. 

May 21st: Indoor dining (not full capacity yet, obviously)

And of course this is all with masks, social distancing, etc. but I think we all know that at this point!"
Anxiety,fpp1hz8,t1_fpov6yi,1588794321.0,I would like to know too. A group of friends and I have been planning a trip there for the last weekend of June (planning started in December). It‚Äôs the one thing I‚Äôve been really looking forward to.
Anxiety,fpnpxtm,t1_fpnow5c,1588769960.0,"I really think warmer weather will have a huge effect on it! Some states aren‚Äôt super warm yet (lately it‚Äôs only been in the 50‚Äôs in my part of Ohio), but by the end of the month most states should be seeing weather in the 70‚Äôs and 80‚Äôs."
Anxiety,fpm5559,t1_fplzjp9,1588725767.0,"Really clear and well thought out! Really hoping they hit phase 5 by September, I have tickets for Riot Fest!"
Anxiety,fpl373k,t1_fpl25yq,1588705562.0,"Make sure you‚Äôre focusing more on hospitalization numbers than case numbers! Also, the actual percentage of positive tests is more important than the number of cases itself."
Anxiety,fpkdn6h,t1_fpk3w1o,1588692770.0,That‚Äôs how it was at a prison here in Ohio too!
Anxiety,fphgtxa,t1_fphdw9p,1588621036.0,Oh yes! That would be awesome if true. I‚Äôve always had a gut feeling that this would really start dying down by summertime. That would definitely line up.
Anxiety,fpgu2g4,t1_fpgtdaz,1588609521.0,Thank you for always posting these updates! It‚Äôs only the fourth day into the month and we‚Äôre already seeing so many decreases in active cases and in new cases. It‚Äôs so encouraging!
Anxiety,fpf5sd0,t1_fpf4dja,1588562466.0,"Such great news! And honestly, I think the media will hopefully start shifting their views soon. With so many places reopening and not having big surges, they‚Äôll kind of have to. Just look at how Texas is doing! More recoveries than new cases even after all of those businesses opening up. People can only take doom and gloom headlines for so long."
Anxiety,fpeur7q,t1_fpeuft8,1588555368.0,"Thank you! I am now. Just needed to take a step back and be more present, not focus on the future too much. It‚Äôll all be okay üòä"
Anxiety,fpeqetw,t3_fj2y1a,1588552733.0,"Just something to maybe cheer everyone up a little bit:

Wasn‚Äôt having a particularly great day (or week, really). Looked up at the sky earlier today and asked if everything would be okay soon. Now there‚Äôs a huge rainbow going over my house. üåà

Even if you aren‚Äôt someone that necessarily believes in ‚Äúsigns‚Äù, it made me smile."
LockdownSkepticism,fpdir04,t1_fpd17ss,1588527791.0,People are also going to want to start seeing their families and have cookouts. I think we might see a lot of ‚Äúrebelling‚Äù with Mother‚Äôs Day too (as long as their mom is not considered high risk). I know I‚Äôm definitely spending the day with my mom and still trying to find a way to have a nice lunch with her.
Anxiety,fpdche8,t1_fpcu264,1588524275.0,"I needed it too. Didn‚Äôt have such a great birthday, and had a really bad anxiety attack over the possibility of losing out on summer completely. It‚Äôs definitely getting harder to stay positive but this thread and everyone here always help a lot."
LockdownSkepticism,fpd0dt3,t1_fpcpn80,1588517104.0,"My boyfriend and I went to a friend‚Äôs ice cream shop yesterday to get a couple of pints to go. Got there and saw a family hanging out outside, and then saw the line out the door. Not a single mask! Finally get in and there‚Äôs people standing around chatting while eating their ice cream. There was also a table set up with a bucket to drop your name into to win a few prizes. And get this: we were all using the SAME PEN (there was hand sanitizer next to it) to write our names. It was great!"
LockdownSkepticism,fpb6by7,t3_ga4lfc,1588463035.0,"This may be a bit of a selfish rant, but I know that the people on this sub will at least understand me.

Today is my birthday. It does not really feel like my birthday at all. I was trying to have a good day, I got takeout from my favorite restaurant and visited my parents for a bit with my boyfriend. So not too bad so far.

Then, on our way home, we drove by an outdoor mall that should‚Äôve been packed with people on a day like today (sunny and 80), but the massive parking lot was completely empty. All it did was remind me of how things currently are. At the beginning of the year when I saw that my birthday was on a Saturday, I made up my mind that I would spend it with a large group of friends at Kings Island. Little did I know then, that it wouldn‚Äôt be happening that way. 

I can‚Äôt even watch my favorite movies right now. As soon as there‚Äôs scenes of people meeting at a cafe, going to a concert, etc. it makes me too sad, and I turn it off. On Monday I am allowed to start working again, but from home. It is starting to feel never ending, my anxiety is skyrocketing, and I don‚Äôt think I can be truly happy again until things are back to normal. I just want my life back."
Anxiety,fpau4hz,t1_fparevi,1588455750.0,"I‚Äôve been lurking on that sub lately and there‚Äôs actually a lot of good points being made in several posts. I‚Äôm hoping that if people start paying more attention to the data, that we can have a normal summer."
LockdownSkepticism,fp85kau,t1_fp7vwxp,1588384085.0,"Even DeWine is starting to change his tune. Originally this morning we were told our Stay at Home was extended to the 29th. Then in his briefing at 2 he said it‚Äôs no longer a Stay at Home order, and to not look into that date too much. Probably feeling the pressure/backlash."
Anxiety,fp7d1k5,t1_fp7cdhy,1588368341.0,Looks like July for most of the world but with a few countries probably still lingering.
Anxiety,fp7c0z4,t1_fp73b55,1588367791.0,"I really cannot thank you enough for posting this. I know it‚Äôs just a prediction but those are some great dates on there. I was starting to spiral after going down a rabbit hole on Twitter (I know, shame on me), and this really helped me. Thank you."
Anxiety,fp79y9m,t1_fp72obg,1588366710.0,"Eastern neighbor as well. I thought we had a plan going, but not so much anymore. Hope they all can start working together!"
LockdownSkepticism,fp6l2y1,t1_fp6jzy5,1588354185.0,"One thing that concerns me the most is that it was put in place by Acton, not DeWine. Is that even legal?"

Edit: he slightly changed his tune in today‚Äôs briefing. Said that it is no longer a ‚Äústay at home order‚Äù and more of a ‚Äústay safe‚Äù order. He also said not to look too much into that date. We might even get a date next week for when restaurants, salons, gyms, etc. can start opening."
Anxiety,foz5x56,t1_foz5hcu,1588185223.0,"It‚Äôs fear-mongering and it‚Äôs disgusting. I have no doubt that we‚Äôll have some sort of vaccine by the end of the year, and then we‚Äôll see what they have to say to that."
Anxiety,foyxj7n,t1_foyx9bu,1588181029.0,"I agree, great news to hear but not a great link or article unfortunately."
Anxiety,foyp6dq,t1_foynoyc,1588176601.0,Right? I‚Äôve been seriously rooting for all of the states that started opening up already. Can‚Äôt wait to hopefully prove them wrong.
Anxiety,fowejka,t1_fow2gyh,1588118235.0,"And that‚Äôs just confirmed recoveries! We‚Äôve gotta be over 1 million if you add all of the unconfirmed ones out there. I have a strong feeling there‚Äôs more than just 110,000ish recoveries in the US."

Anxiety,foof3ga,t1_foo4ggr,1587937820.0,"This is so great to hear! I‚Äôm glad she kind of addressed the media as well:

‚ÄúAnd I think we have to be responsible about our headlines. I think often the reporting may be accurate in paragraph three, four and five. But I‚Äôm not sure how many people actually get to paragraph three, four and five,‚Äù she added. ‚ÄúAnd I think the responsibility that the press has is to really ensure that the headlines reflect the science and data that is in their piece itself,‚Äù she said‚Äù"
Anxiety,food3o8,t1_foo94e4,1587936845.0,"I really do feel like not just regular media, but social media plays a huge part in how people are reacting to COVID. Back then it was really just MySpace. Facebook was just starting to get popular and was still people posting stuff like ‚Äújust woke up and had some cereal!‚Äù. Now on social media people want everyone else to be just as scared as they are. Even if that means sharing fake articles."
Anxiety,foocjci,t1_foo80gr,1587936565.0,"The people comparing it to Spanish Flu annoy me the most. There was a bad second wave because they still didn‚Äôt know how to treat it back then, and couldn‚Äôt track it the way that we can track this. They didn‚Äôt really have anything to base ending their lockdowns on back then, they just kind of did it. We‚Äôre ending our lockdowns with actual proof that the rate of positive cases is going down, hospitalizations going down, etc. Plus I really think we‚Äôll at least have an approved treatment plan for patients by this fall, if not a vaccine as well. As far as how the virus acts (with the exception of how contagious it is), it should be compared to SARS before anything else."

We may not have a vaccine by this fall, but I think there will at least be an approved treatment and we won‚Äôt be caught off guard like the first wave."
Anxiety,foo3ya7,t3_fj2y1a,1587932028.0,"Was reading an article before bed last night (of course now I can‚Äôt find it), stating that if this really has been circulating as early as November, then what we‚Äôre dealing with now is/could be the second wave. This would be good news, as there likely wouldn‚Äôt be another. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs too crazy of a concept, honestly.  Was wondering if anyone else remembers seeing an article like this anywhere?

We did see a small spike in cases this week, but a lot of that is from ramping up testing in prisons and in nursing homes. Hospitalizations are still going down. We are still in relatively good shape. Edit: also, avoid the news still. They are making the spike sound a lot worse than it actually was. Ignore the numbers and look at graphs for Ohio instead."

Anxiety,fo49llm,t1_fo496df,1587500550.0,Exactly this! Ohio had a spike last week and everyone freaked out. Luckily Amy Acton told everyone to calm down because it was just from a backlog of tests done in a few prisons.
Anxiety,fo47vf5,t1_fo466xg,1587499702.0,"Wow, I‚Äôm genuinely shocked! Some of those comments make good points too.
