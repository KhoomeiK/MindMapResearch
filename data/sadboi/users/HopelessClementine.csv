They‚Äôre both Asian-American pretty sure OP was just summing it up. Also the show is about Devi not Paxton, and they don‚Äôt have much time to explore every little thing about him. Pretty sure they only made the episode about Ben so they could make him more likable for the audience so he can be seen as a possible love interest; because we were already rooting for Paxton, there was no point in making an entire episode for him in season one. If they tried to include his background even more into the show it would make him seem token. But instead they just played it naturally because this show is about normal teenagers living life. Sure it‚Äôs pretty diverse in cast but overall they don‚Äôt out do themselves by overthinking things. They mentioned Ben being Jewish as much as they mention Paxton being Japanese because it‚Äôs not the whole of their character, they‚Äôre  three dimensional characters with flaws here and there. I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll explore more of his character as a way to combat the Devi-Ben situation in Season 2."

There is nothing wrong with defining yourself at a young age. Lots of people know if they‚Äôre different from the norm at a young age so it‚Äôs good that you know yourself enough to use this label.

mixedrace,fnu6oql,t3_g3xg85,1587255645.0,"I usually just hang out with people that find interest in me, and who tend to have the same interest in general. Most of the time I find my friends through other friends, work, or various classes.

For sure I have friends from all sorts of places. Some of them are immigrants and some of them were born in my city. My university is technically a PWI, but my city is predominantly black. And we have whole sections of my city where it's various different immigrants and refugees. So, for the most part, I have friends with different backgrounds.

But if you want me to break it down by race I have friends who are from/or descendent of various parts of Asia (including the Middle East) and Africa. Some of them are black and some white. A few are mixed like me, just different races sometimes. And some are Hispanic or Latino (I know that these aren't races, but I'm just counting this as a representation of different ethnicities/cultures).

I think it takes time to feel included. No one will ever have the same experience as you, because your identity is different than the majority. Even other mixed people will sometimes make you feel out of place because it is rare to find someone who has the same exact mixed-race identity and experience as you. In general, I think you'll feel a lot better focusing less on whether or not you fit somewhere and more on where you find your interest. 

For instance, I'm a creative writing English major and my first friends came from my gen ed English and Anthropology class. Then the following semester I met friends who I took Spanish and film with.  I don't know how far along you are in university, but I suggest sticking to classes you find interest in (especially gen eds). For example, I wanted to learn more about cultural backgrounds for my writing and took Cultural Anthropology for my gen ed in Social Sciences and that's where I met one of my current best friends (and reunited with one of my friends from high school). The silver lining isn't hard to find when you put a little effort into it."

Similar things like this has happened to me with past guy ‚Äúfriends‚Äù, and being demisexual, it‚Äôs made me really skeptical about guys. But luckily, lately I‚Äôve found a few guys who are now close friends and I can hangout with them without feeling like they have other motives."

I wouldn't suggest trying to force yourself into any type of ""casual situationship"" if that's not what seems natural to you, trust me I've tried and it only made my anxiety peak; and it's not good for your mental or emotional health. But after all, sexuality is still flexible so you shouldn't put pressure on yourself to completely identify with a certain identity. I suggest you just take some time and reflect on what you find attractive in people, and you'll have a better understanding of what you're attracted to without forcing yourself to ""experience"" certain things because ""that's what's normal""."

I wasn't sure how or if I should write the post, but I might just go ahead and do it. I've only ever told the story to a few people, but I've still never used the term ""demisexual"" when explaining either. It's been bugging me for ages to not explain it, but really you kind of summed it up lol"
