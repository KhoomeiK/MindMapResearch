BipolarReddit,foyn55d,t3_ga9sws,1588175519.0,"Omg I have such a similar story it's actually scary!!!
I had undiagnosed bipolar since I was 17 as well (only got diagnosed when I was 23).struggled a lot at university till I got excluded for failing the same course twice( my advice - speak to the school before things get out of hand, see if you can maybe spilt up your coursework over two semesters or some arrangement like that, had I known how drastically bipolar was screwing with my ability to learn I would have done that before it was too late).
I had huge manic episode shortly after that ( which landed me in a psychiatric hospital - where I was finally diagnosed) I did some really embarrassing stuff that will probably haunt me for a very long time, but knowing that you have a condition which is out of your control kinda takes away some of the guilt and shame. I don't know about you but I've basically lost all my friends over the course of the last 5 years - I grew up in a very small religious community and i lost the few friends I had when I decided to homeschool myself and go to university) and the friends that I made at university disappeared after a major suicidal depression , which landed me in a psychiatric hospital again.

My take on this - life is a roller coaster it has ups and downs, crazy highs and drastic lows: ENJOY THE RIDE 
But most importantly get a good psychiatrist - mine saved my life!!"
