I suspect it’s a mix of rebellious libidinal impulse, attention seeking, mock social engagement and means to stoke pliability in others, self medication .... probably a bunch of other stuff... it starts by pointing to comradery but often ends in very destructive behaviour that comprises any bonds and then some.
