fitpregnancy,fp634su,t3_gb3x0f,1588345172.0,"pregnancy makes your body more insulin resistant. Especially in the first trimester. Don’t beat yourself up for gaining. 

As someone who lost a pound in the first trimester, I gained 13 pounds in one month for my 19 week past checkup... pregnancy weight gain isn’t the same for everyone and isn’t linear. You may not go on to gain that much more, the last trimester is mainly fluid retention and the first trimester is mainly carb loading with the added caveat of your body naturally trying to pack on weight. 

My weight gain has stalled and I really attribute this to home workouts, trying to do weight resistance rather than running. I was running 3 miles a day and gave up on weights when my gym closed. For me, running barely makes a budge on my weight but lifting weights has me drop weight like crazy. I recently started running 2 miles a day and trying to walk a couple, while doing a home workout with resistance bands. 

One thing that makes eating healthier easier for me is having a mindset of filling up on protein rich, fat rich meals rather than having a mindset of restricting. I go into the day of thinking how can I hit my protein and fat goals rather than what do I need to avoid. It helps me fill up on nutrient dense foods rather than empty calories and bread. When I gained 13 pounds we were moving and not buying groceries/eating out a lot. I was so hungry and overeating because I was filling up on fast burning carbs and sugar, which don’t keep you as satiated. Carbs also help you maintain water weight, for every carb you eat you retain water. It’s about 3g of water per carb you retain. This is crazy and idk why OBS don’t tell us swollen miserable preggo moms this. It would motivate us a lot more than saying hey watch the junk food and restrict calories! 

So far I haven’t gained any more weight and feel so much better. It’s been about a month from when I gained 13pounds."
homebirth,fp0dfae,t3_gahvc7,1588207125.0,"I would like to say just don’t share it. People will judge and people will say don’t do it. You will be surprised by the strangers who suddenly get angry over the safety of your baby. You will be shocked at who has TERRIBLE birth stories they can’t wait to share. 

People don’t “come out” about having hospital births, you have no duty to “come out” about having a home birth. 

It is more dangerous, shit happens. It’s not your duty to convince everyone it’s safer. That immediately invalidates you to the other person. If something terrible happens, yes it would be better to be at a hospital. Don’t deny it, don’t try and prove how safe it is. It’s your choice, your baby, your body, your life. 

I’m doing a home birth, I have a deep pull toward home birth this time. I can’t explain it and I’m a completely sane person, had my first son at the hospital and vaccinated my son. My intuition is telling me to have a home birth. I have many other reasons but I am very well aware of complications that could arise and don’t waste my time saying it’s perfectly safe. I am low risk, in shape and doing things (no matter how voodoo they may seem) to prep my body and my mentality for a home birth. 

The experience of prepping for a home birth really is showing me over and over again the lesson I learned and am still learning. People are going to judge your parenting choices, strangers at the store are going to judge how you discipline, you are going to have opinions or beliefs that the mainstream disagrees on. This is parenthood and it took awhile for me but I am getting to the point where I don’t care to explain or defend my decisions anymore. You don’t need permission to ask for a home birth. 

I said before it’s more dangerous. Many people will say oh no it’s not it’s perfectly safe. No... it is more dangerous. Research for yourself and don’t let anyone claim to know that it is or isn’t. 

BUT THAT BEING SAID

Pick a good midwife. Don’t pick the cheapest because she’s the cheapest. Pick one who is experienced with emergencies, who is honest and upfront about the risks, one who you connect with and feel safe with. Make sure you have a connection with her and trust her to deliver your baby or tell you if you need to go to the hospital. 

Also:
A good midwife will be experienced. She will come prepared to resuscitate the baby, come prepared with medication to give you in emergencies, she will know if it gets to a point where you need to go to the hospital. 

That’s another point, make sure to vet them on if they would know when to transport to the hospital. The midwives I interviewed expressed that they know when to transport pretty early into the labor. 

Not all midwives are created equal."

My brother was gaining weight pretty badly. At 15 he was having heart issues and his doctor told him to cut back on junk food and get in shape. He did it all by himself.

Then I started doing one when I woke up and one before bed, basically just because I wanted to run more and enjoyed it but couldn’t cut more than 15 minutes here and there due to having a newborn. 

Then we got a treadmill and I knew I wanted to run a half marathon before I got pregnant. So one week I was like f it I’m going to run a 5k three times this week. I ended up doing it. Then I said I would do 4, 5 and 6 mile runs that week. So I did it. Then I aimed for 9 miles once the next week and two 4 milers. And I did it and found it wasn’t that bad, I went for distance not time and my husband was supportive in watching my son while I did it. Then I got pregnant (we were trying but I didn’t expect to get pregnant on the first try) and had some complications so I stopped running for a couple months. So I let go of the half marathon goal and now decided to just stick to a 5k or whatever I can fit during my sons nap so it doesn’t cut into family time. 
I never got to a high mile time but plan to after I have my baby. 

I found it came down to a just do it mindset.

So rather than the benefit being from the pill, it’s more so the benefit from the brain having to create a new state of homeostasis, or overcome the pill. 

Kind of like working out, the muscle gain isn’t in the working out aspect but more so the bodies ability to overcome the damage created to the muscles from working out. (This isn’t implying antidepressants create brain damage lol.)

It’s tough and I regress sometimes but I can’t even begin to explain the sense of peace I have with keto. It’s like the world changes. I think it has something to do with glutamate, being keto has been suggested to be beneficial because high sugar/gluten diets mess up the Glutamate/gaba balance. I had tics and compulsions, I would twitch if I drank caffeine or alcohol. This is another reason why I suspect glutamate excess to play a part. 

I’m not saying it’s the healthiest diet, I’m just saying that for my specific situation the benefits out weigh any downfalls of the keto/paleo/carnivore based diet. I’d rather have high cholesterol than live with extreme anxiety like I was. 

I the peace is something a lot of keto people will talk about. My grandmother has bipolar/schizophrenia and after years of medication came off after doing keto/wheat belly diet.

The first half, where I was living in danger and abuse, and the second half where I am now (where I am safe but constantly looking to the past to make sure it isn’t creeping up in me, or constantly battling parts of me that carry on the past.) I am safe now but constantly looking inside myself to make sure I don’t become manipulative, abusive, negative ect.. 

I also agree with your last paragraph that the two versions of a father, one who is my biological father and one who I now consider to be my father (my Father in law). I am constantly shedding what I grew up thinking a man was supposed to be. It’s such a stark constraint. I got the feeling that my father saying we were going to die was my father saying you are doomed to repeat my mistakes and fall into our family patterns. I also got the feeling my father in law saying he had the snakes in the trunk was him saying, no I got this and we have control. 

In response to the part about me not being a good enough mother, I constantly have dreams about putting my son in danger and not trying to safe him. Example: knowing he is playing in the road, not slowing down and hitting him and saying to myself “no he’s fine” with my own mother in the car saying “he is dying”."

I forgave them long ago. I have no ill wishes or anger towards them anymore. It was a long and hard process.

When I talk of my trauma I talk about it because it’s a crucial piece of my life, not because I still am angry or upset with them. It’s more to give context I guess. 

I do kundalini yoga, meditate for up to an hour a day and have a really fulfilling spiritual practice down."

I find my self esteem issues went back to how my mother talked to me. 

It’s deeper than just holding your head up high and faking it until you make it.

I’m in school to be a therapist and my classes teach that self esteem is not meaningful to focus on. What you can focus on is positive self talk. Try and notice when you are being negative on yourself and acknowledge it, then allow it to fade away like a smoke cloud. 
Also work on things that make you feel accomplished. Is it getting good grades? Is it dressing better and taking care of yourself? Is it beating your mile record? Focus on giving yourself reasons to feel accomplished. 

You can also try meditation."
KetoBabies,flxh4mj,t3_frnx3g,1585582787.0,"Hey! I don’t really have much advice for what you are asking but staying away from folic acid (NOT the natural form, FOLATE) may be better than getting foods fortified with folic acid. 

Folate is very important. There are just as many studies showing the importance of folate as there are showing a correlation of folic acid and neural tube defects and autism. I know I sound like a nut but you can look it up for yourself. 
The issue is cereals and breads fortify with the synthetic, unnatural version of folate that isn’t absorbed by many with a common mutation (MTHFR, or something like that.) it’s hard to even find a prenatal with the natural folate version, it’s so upsetting because the back of it says folate but the ingredient list denotes the unnatural version. They are used interchangeably and shouldn’t be. My ob wasn’t even aware of this and it sounds like that nurse isn’t either. 

Please look it up for yourself. It’s really scary how OBs push those sample prenatals loaded with 800+ mg of folic acid when the research clearly shows high levels of folic acid leads to negative outcomes."
KetoBabies,fll79uf,t3_fp32u9,1585254932.0,"What works for others may be completely different for you. I breastfed for 2 years doing keto . I was strict, under 20 carbs and for a few months did carnivore or 0 carb. I never had issues with supply as long as I ate enough calories. I also ran daily and lifted weights 3x a week , for me it was just making sure to eat enough calories. If you need sugar your body makes it, through gluconeogenesis. For example, muscles can’t use certain sugars like fruit sugars and can’t use fat for energy . If muscles needs energy your body knows what to do, it converts other things to the sugar your muscles need to workout. Some people notice huge spikes in blood sugar after working out, even on carnivore. Our bodies are amazing. People have been breastfeeding on a keto diet for generations out of necessity. I would say just make sure to keep electrolyte and calories up and it will work itself out. 
Make sure to focus on salt, magnesium and potassium. You need more than you think and I did notice my son trying to nurse more frequently when I didn’t keep my electrolytes and calories up."

At the beginning I was strict keto/ loose carnivore. I ate so much meat and eggs and overall nutrient dense foods. Around week 10 is where I went off track and week 13 is when I got back on track. 

I do a no salt electrolyte drink and take magnesium (and load on iodized salt).

SkincareAddiction,fl7gjid,t3_fn46fm,1584901269.0,"22F, a lot of sun exposure and minimal routine. I’ve never used anything but a random cleanser here and there until recently. 

AM
Neutrogena deep cleansing cream 
Tokyo labs skin plumping gel

PM
Neutrogena deep cleansing cream 
Mary k emollient night cream

That’s about it. 

I would love to try some of the ordinary recommended products. They seem reasonably priced and are easy to get.

I have severe bags due to lack of sleep and that won’t be changing for 2 years due to babies and school. 

I have sun damage and plan to start using a good moisturizer with spf if anyone has a recommendation.

I believe to have closed comedones on my forehead due to daily sweating from LDrunning. 

I would love for pore minimization tips.

My skin type is basically normal.. tight if I over cleanse and not oily unless I oil it up with moisturizers i listed. 

I get (I believe) hormonal breakouts under and around my chin. Looks like closed comedones also. Blackheads or clogged pores around my nose. 


I don’t know where to start. Toners? Serums? New cleanser? I need a good moisturizer and spf."

Wash with neutrogena deep clean cleanser 
Moisturize with Tokyo labs skin plumping gel cream

(Looking for a drugstore sunscreen recommendation along with someone pointing me to some products I may need.)

PM routine 
Wash with neutrogena deep clean cleanser 
Sometimes I put Mary K Emollient cream on.

My skin is pretty normal. I wouldn’t say it’s oily unless I oil it up and it can get dry if I use a face mask. I have terrible bags under my eyes but that’s due to not sleeping through the night, my son is a terrible sleeper and I’m pregnant and pee 4 times a night on top of him waking up twice a night. 

I think I have a problem with closed comedones on my forehead due to shampoo and sweating from running and sauna. 
I also see I have sun spots and premature wrinkles. I spend as much time outside as I can and haven’t ever used a sunscreen for daily outings. 

I’m looking to heal my huge pores and whatever is going on in the picture I posted. I would love recommendations for a good drugstore routine. I don’t even know where to start. Toner? Vitamin c ?"
SkincareAddiction,fl73hx2,t3_fn1y9d,1584893378.0,"So I currently use neutrogena deep cream cleanser and hada labo Tokyo skin pluming gel cream. This is the extent of my regiment. I don’t wear makeup and I workout a lot so I sweat a lot. I also spend a lot of time outside and just bought a nice, clean daily sunscreen to wear on my face. 

So I also believe I have closed comedones (?) on my forehead. 

Can anyone tell me the type of flair ups in the picture and the cause of them? 

Also is the Tokyo gel cream even a moisturizer? How good is that for hydrating skin? 

I am looking for someone to recommend some products to look for at a drugstore. A good cleanser and maybe something for the closed comedones and also for those spots and large pores on my nose. 

Thank you!"

If I see people kiss or even some people having a steamy moment on tv I am absolutely adverse and triggered. I have no tips but my husband is completely on board with my healing and it sounds like yours is too. I desire to desire my husband and connect with him sexually.
