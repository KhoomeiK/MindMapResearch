National Suicide Prevention Lifeline: 1-800-273-8255

I have been the undiagnosed bipolar partner for many years. I want to tell you this- you do yourself no good thinking your God complex will save her. And she will never live a fulfilling life if she doesn‚Äôt acknowledge her own choices and grow from them. Therapy and meds keep me grounded, but it‚Äôs the open communication between myself and my SO that keep us in our balanced relationship. I would let go and move onward. You can find someone who wants to be with you because you‚Äôre you. Someone‚Äôs dis-ease should never be the reason to stay together if it caused the break up to begin with. And as I have learned, TRUST is more valuable than gold. Trust is willing to be vulnerable to each other, no matter what. Perhaps it‚Äôs time to seek the true value in a person that will also help you grow too. Sending you good vibes, OP."

bipolar,ewh9wsl,t1_ewgbdqy,1565401912.0,"I looked up what google said:
‚ÄúA disorder associated with episodes of mood swings ranging from depressive lows to manic highs.
The exact cause of bipolar disorder isn‚Äôt known, but a combination of genetics, environment, and altered brain structure and chemistry may play a role.‚Äù

For myself, I‚Äôve always had mixed states, mostly depression. But this was not fully diagnosed until I met a mental health professional and answered the assessment as painfully honest as possible (bipolar 2). Sometimes there‚Äôs a root cause or trigger, but again, a mental health professional is best to consult. 

As someone who swings a bit on moods (meds only do so much) I recommend a journal or log of some kind. Just tracking your mood twice a day, same times, with same factors, can help you see if it‚Äôs more environmental stress or if it‚Äôs really something deeper worth investigating. Awareness tools have helped me a lot in the past. 

Best wishes~"

I have two cousins younger than me who died via suicide and depression, and all I have left are the good memories. They left deep impressions on me. So remember, You‚Äôre adding value to your daughter‚Äôs life and that says something about you too. 

I‚Äôve never had pets but the dogs and owners I‚Äôve met, their fur babies are irreplaceable. Pure love, no judgments.
