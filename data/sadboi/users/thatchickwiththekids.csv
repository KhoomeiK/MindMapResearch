unpopularopinion,fm9uf86,t3_ftt01s,1585876810.0,"I have two 3 year olds. Normally bloody legends when out for dinner. If not just sitting at the table colouring in/eating/talking, they may pop out of their chairs and sit on the floor with one another or run to the other side of the table. You sense them getting inpatient and well.....obnoxious, you give them the phone so they be quiet. It may be a little loud, but obviously not loud enough that other tables hear it over their conversation but you may still hear it (better than a child screaming though, right?) Or you move outside....or only go places where there’s a play area etc. Kids can fuck you up and randomly be obnoxious little fuckers, every kid on the odd occasion may get in the way or annoy another table, trust me it’s just as stressful for the Parent. Well.....most Parents."

insaneparents,fcw3efr,t3_ej52pr,1578016226.0,"My Mum actually had the EXACT same view on this specific vaccine when they were administering the vaccines like 7-8 years ago in high school...but the vaccine was actually new then and she really could find little info on it. But now in 2020, there’s been more research done and not like everyone who’s had the vaccine is dead so my Mum was the one to recommend me getting it. Literally calling every day until I’d go and get it.
In saying that, she was being cautious and looking out for my best interest. It is now 2020, your Mum’s best interest should be you having the vaccine."

I left their Dad when they were 1 (for good reason) and their Dad has nothing to do with them or his family either for that matter.

I spent 8 years struggling wit anorexia and then bulimia, went through loads of recovery etc fell pregnant to twins, have two very healthy 3 three year old girls. I was recovered but like......not. Binge/purge free for 1 1/2 years. I was exercising but not overdoing it. The trainer then said I should aim to lose 3kg in 8 weeks (mind you, I did NOT need to) eat 1200 calories, track it in MyFitnessPal. I did that.....I shouldn’t have. I relapsed for 2 months. I’m just regaining control back now. I could never advise morreeeeeeeee, tracking calories leads to eating disorders and leads to relapses. It’s the control. It’s bloody shit."
AmItheAsshole,f7y1n7e,t3_dxy8m5,1574083781.0,"I’m a single Mum of twin 3 year olds myself, studying and running a business. 
Life is hectic. 
That is literally the only way you can explain it sometimes besides going into the detail. There’s no “crying the single mum card” you’re simply explaining the situation.
You’re out trying to make a better life for yourself and your family and set a good example for your children all whilst still going about a “normal” life. 
I’m sure this woman has had numerous mental breakdowns trying to get her work done on time and then there’s the added pressure when it’s a group assignment. Chuck a sick kid on top of that, added shifts at work and it is purely draining. 
She may not be as “smart” as this guy to begin with and then her lack of time, maybe he lends her a hand, give her some pointers. I’m sure she’ll appreciate it and your assignment will reflect that. YTA."

EatingDisorders,f2v2xid,t3_dbr5fb,1570443182.0,"For 8 years, I struggled harrdddddd with anorexia which also led onto bulimia. For 3 of those 8 years I was seeing a gp/counsellor/dietician/psychologist and also a hypnotherapist (which I must say, probably helped the most in the long run). Recovery was by far the hardest and most stressful thing I have ever experienced in my life. And it doesn’t happen overnight. It took years! Much longer than the 3 I was seeking treatment in. But long story short, I had twins! From being so sick I was told there was minimal chance of ever falling pregnant to then giving birth to healthy twin girls. I also own a custom cake business! My two dreams I thought were crushed when my eating disorders controlled me. Don’t get me wrong, I do have my shit days where I feel out of control and the thoughts creep back in. But life is amazing. Truly amazing!!!!"
