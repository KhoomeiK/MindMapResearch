But that’s just my experience. 
 
I’ve been told tarte’s shape tape is also a great concealer for covering pores and lines but it’s very heavy. I don’t like it because I can noticeably feel it on my face.

Languachat,fh6pnvi,t3_f0y7zj,1581303034.0,"Yes. I can honestly say I think entirely different! I grew up bilingual, speaking Spanish and English. Mom is Mexican dad is American. So I’ve always had multiple language influences. 

In college I took French and Korean, and I can honestly say it changes your thinking pattern. 

Many languages cross over in casual phrases, “Que Sera Sera” means “what will be will be” in Spanish. “Get your Derrière over here” means “get your butt over here” derrière being a French word that means behind (location, not butt). 

So it’s a unique ability to be able to trace different types of cultural lingo to their roots. 

I also understand accents better, and I’m kinder to foreigners than monolinguals are because I know the struggles that come with speaking a language that isn’t native. It’s hard, and it takes time. 

I also see patterns really well. Not sure if this is one that developed because I spoke multiple languages from the get-go or if I learned more languages because I find patterns easily. 

My personality also changes based off the language I speak too, that might be due to the cultural differences though, for example the French don’t smile and aren’t very open. So when I speak French I tend to avoid eye contact and I don’t smile very often, (subconscious, I don’t actively plan this. This was just pointed out to me). 

My head voice has no permanent language either. It just kind of mingles into thoughts. Might sound a little weird but just hang on. When I only spoke English and Spanish my thought would have two separate settings. Thinking in English and thinking in Spanish. Now that I know French and some Korean it just kind of evolved into pure thoughts with no language behind them. 

Maybe the last one is unique only to me, but idk. 

TLDR; learning more languages is a total gain in your life. I highly recommend."

bipolar,ey82opn,t3_cw3f97,1566909586.0,"Here’s my advice. 
Get cleaned up or as best as you can. Go to a library. Make a resume. Plenty of templetes on the internet to look at. 
Make a go fund me account. Tell people your situation. Many will understand the plights of being homeless and will try to help as best as possible. 

Then go to city hall. As for the mayor or anyone of high status make an appointment if you have to. Tell them your situation. Explain to them that you are ready to change and make amends and protect your family. 
Odds are you’ll land a steady job and ask that if they can’t give you a job that they recommend you to someone. 

Be as honest and earnest as possible. 

Save up money if you can. 

Go to a doctor and get meds, stay on meds for a solid year. Then make a plea to get your kids back. With the job, medication, and a reputable built reputation you’ll most likely be able to get your kids back. 

Hardest part will be landing a landlord. If you can make it, try to open a savings account and save 4x down payment for a place to live/rent. Most landlords will be understating and give you residence if you have a job and have proof of being able to pay for rent.

He knew his plane better than he knew himself. He spent half his youth admiring and watching his father work on that plane. To him the plane was like his brother, and as the years went on time wore his brother down. As a final good bye to his beloved brother he decided to take him to the resting place of their father: Alaska. The trip in total was 16 hours. A trip he and his brother had made many times before. 
He prepared the plane and before the break of dawn Randy was in the sky.

As he flew over the beauty of Alaska in search of his fathers final resting place Randy admired the fresh blanket of snow that laid on the land. He couldn’t help but admire and fear the beauty of nature. Although the ground looked like freshly dried cotton blankets, Randy knew that those blankets were thicker than 20 inch steel.  This reminded him of his time in Nam. 
He saw the worst side of humanity as a pilot in Vietnam. 

While in his flash back he failed to notice the warning signs his brother was screaming at him, and by the time he came to his bi-plane began to shake;20 more notches until he was out of fuel. Surrounded by nothing except blanket of frigid death.
Without notice all the flights in his cockpit turned on. The winds tore something off and Randy didn’t have enough time to fix it. Down he went, plummeting to the earth, flashes of fighting in Nam rushed to his mind, clouding his vision. 

Before he knew it he was deep into the fresh, white, hard snow. 

By the time Randy was able to excavate himself from the crash the snow had begun to fall. It was as if Mother Nature herself was furious that Randy had ruined her freshly laundered blanket. Within 30 minutes she had covered him completely. 

And as Randy clung close to his brother, his trusted bi-plane. He looked upon a photo given to him by his late father. The photo was of Randy in the cockpit of his plane, and written delicately on the side was “The mighty bipolar pilot”"
