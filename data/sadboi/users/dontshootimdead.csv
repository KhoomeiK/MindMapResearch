I really hope the game is actually good because I’m tired of all these “gamers” blaming badly written games on the LGBT community (instead of the people who acc developed the game) simply because a character happens to be LGBT."

MensLib,foaqad8,t3_f1d9tx,1587650817.0,"I’ve dealt microaggressions my whole life being female, Arab, and LGBT. I get teachers and classmates making comments about how I “must’ve been raised” or how “strict” my parents must be. I know it’s not done from a place of malice but having a preconceived idea of someone is hardly a good thing. You shouldn’t judge a person based on anything other than what they give you. I know this is hard to live by in a society as fast as ours, where you sometimes don’t have time to build a rapport with someone, but that’s not much of an excuse in my opinion. I’ve learnt to outgrow any preemptive judgement I might have of someone until I actually know them enough to make a judgment. However, while I don’t believe a single microaggression causes much harm, things like these tend to accumulate over time."
