Come on, sterilized or not, there's a reason you don't mix pots for cooking other things that aren't food, with the ones you use for food. 

A tiny pot won't cost much. I'm a chick and I'd be disgusted if I found out one of my cooking pots were being used for a yucky cup - and I used tampons without the insertion thingiemaging."

I have Pandora, I don't reckon a HS kid can afford it, unless they went for the cheaper lines. Pandora is a great way to give someone you care about a piece of jewelry without going bankrupt, or gifting someone charms when *they are collecting the goddamn charms*, not like this dude."

If this is how much she means to you, I shudder what the relationship is like.

Had you not hyped it, you wouldn't be an ass. But you did, and as much as it's your money, your consesus here was basically ""fuck her gift, imma get myself an expensive watch"". 

You didn't even get her a nice secondary gift, either, as in you put barely any effort. That's a yikes from me, chief."

You call yourself what you want. Sure, you're technically more mixed, just like I'm *technically* African, yet I'd probably get shit on too because I don't *fit* their view. It's not like you're calling yourself black based on nothing, like some ""*famous*"" people. 

I'm assuming you're in america? People there really take their race shit too seriously, without realising how racist or condescending they're being."

I mean, I want ginger kids really badly, but I'm a fucking dark hair/brown eyed tw it who will never have them, so I'll have to settle for ugly kids instead.

The fact it's *such* a big deal to her though, oof. But you said she comes from a very racist backround so this might just be what she was forced into believing since young, otherwise, why would she be with you and planning a future with you?"

>The guy repeatedly asked to NOT be called by his first name by his son. It is 100% disrespectful to disregard his requests.

It's his NAME, not an insult. He's a goddamn kid, forcing it down that he HAS to call him dad isn't going to work - that's not how things work. 

>And ""going through a phase"" is a piss poor excuse to be an ass. Oh no, A WEEK of grounding for not listening to your parents?! Call child protective services asap! Lmao.

No, it isn't. It's a fucking reality. Over-punishing doesn't fucking work, especially if he uses the *same* punishment for more severe shit. Not calling your father, ""dad"" can be easily fixed by other methods.
When will you lot understand punishing even the slightest thing doesn't work?"

Plenty of people call their parents by their name, doesn't make it disrespectful. It will depend on their culture and family dynamic. 

This guy is being a major ass to a 13 year old kid who's going through a phase, *which we all do*. He could've easily ignored him, which will annoy the kid and get him (OP) what he wants. But grounding him a *week* over this? That's absurd."
