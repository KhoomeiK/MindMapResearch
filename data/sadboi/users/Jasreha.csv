insaneparents,fm6yc1c,t1_fm67oor,1585806949.0,"Okay, so: growing up, I lived with my maternal grandparents (Nana and Pa). They were generally Not Great at parenting. I would see my Dad (technically ex-stepdad) and his mom, who I call Neenie. Dad was told he had no rights to visitation, etc., which he accepted as fact until they tried cutting him out of my life (for context on why I wasn‚Äôt with him to begin with). 

At Nana‚Äôs, we had one dog, Kerry Anne.

At my Dad‚Äôs, we had four cats - Lisa, Smokey, Bailey, and Nibbles. Nibbles was my angel cat, my sweet girl, my absolute baby. 

Going into my Freshman year of high school, Nana and Pa decided they were going to move to Montana. We‚Äôd lived there before. This is when all the stuff with Tabby went down - no one wanted me to take Nibbles, I‚Äôm promised a kitten when we move, etc. Neenie found out they made me give Tabby back to the shelter, and went and got Tabby, all was well. Dad got custody of me about three months later.

My freshman year of college rolls around and I can‚Äôt handle it. I was a straight A student that was like, checking-my-grades-in-my-sleep level anxiety, and living in a dorm and thinking I could handle a full course load my first semester did not go well. I was too ashamed to tell my Dad, so I went to the person I didn‚Äôt feel like I had to prove anything to: my Mom (who I had very sparse contact with for 18 years prior, but spent a month with my Sophomore year summer break and most of my summer after Senior year with). Got a job. Things were fine. Got two dogs. Six months in, we call in the fire department when a plug started a small fire. They basically look at the house we‚Äôre renting and tell us it shouldn‚Äôt even be being rented out (after a while of random health problems we found out were related to mold). 

So where do Mom and I wind up moving...? Back in with Nana and Pa. 

Took me two years to finally get out of that mess. I wound up losing one of the dogs (irresponsible former roommate let her out while I was working, and she has been missing 15 months now)... I now live very happily alone with three dogs, a cat, several rats, and a fish. And no one to tell me I have to get rid of any of them.

Nibbles is living with Neenie and another cat, Phantom, after her oldest cat, Samantha passed away, and Tabby is very happy being the ruler of my Dad‚Äôs house (Lisa and Smokey are too lazy to care). They also have another cat, Khadgar."

My maternal grandparents (who had custody of me from 18 months old) moved across the country with me in tow my freshman year of high school. I couldn‚Äôt bring my cat from my dad‚Äôs, so they promised me when we got there I could go to the shelter and get a cat.

I got a gorgeous little tabby kitten. She had just turned 8 weeks.

Two months in, my dad started custody proceedings (I knew about this about three months prior because, surprise, I was the one who suggested it) and my grandparents had to move back to Indiana because they couldn‚Äôt afford two lawyers (one to handle the case locally and one to handle the case out of state). They told me a four day drive was too much for a kitten and made me take her back to the shelter.

My dad‚Äôs mother was LIVID. After we moved, this woman, this amazing woman, flew from Chicago to Seattle, drove down to Libby, Montana, adopted the cat, and made the whole trip back.

The shelter kept in contact with my grandparents to let them know how kitty was doing and spilled the beans that Tabby was now living in Chicago.

They told me - even at the time - it was to teach me a hard lesson (on what? To this day I don‚Äôt know). The only thing I got out of it was that my grandma loved her dog, thought the new kitten was stressing her out, and didn‚Äôt want to make the move with another animal, so mine had to go.

Tabby is a happy, healthy big girl who plays sous chef for my stepmom now.

I can‚Äôt imagine doing this to anyone. My family tried getting me to give up my first dog (I was 19 and got a sweet pit puppy) and I literally moved out of state with nothing to my name to keep her. People fucking suck. Pets aren‚Äôt a toy or an accessory. They‚Äôre family."

As of right now, the brain zaps are bearable; they‚Äôre more annoying than anything else. 

I‚Äôve been sleeping a LOT to combat the nausea/bloating; no actual vomiting, but even drinking water makes my stomach upset. 

I‚Äôm super sleepy all the time and have been in a nice cuddle pile with the dogs since about this time last night (12ish hours seems to be my body‚Äôs new limit, which I‚Äôm super happy for - I was sleeping upwards of 18 before!). 

I‚Äôm a bit on edge and irritable, but mostly just when the bloating kicks in since it‚Äôs physically painful at times. On the flip side, I noticed I‚Äôm actually laughing at things. I was scrolling through Reddit yesterday and actually laughing out loud, not just exhaling and snorting at funny things.

And through all of this, I‚Äôve had no desire to actually take any. There‚Äôs a little disguised-as-logic voice telling me if I took some and took a nap, I could probably wake up and actually make some food and eat, which sounds awesome because everything sounds so good, but the rest of me immediately goes, ‚ÄúWhy would we do that?

If it's more than a day off, (say, two days off and then back on the third), I alternate between being hyper as hell and being a total zombie. It feels like I'm in a dream and nothing is real.

On my next break from work I'm hoping to get off of it with the help of nyquil, a dog sitter, and a lot of water. I can't stand this shit anymore."

If you're serious about moving in with her and can handle at least one month of walking her through the consequences of her spending habits? Great. Cool. If not, I would seriously rethink the arrangement - because, especially if this is her first time living independently, on her own dime, I can almost guarentee it won't go flawlessly."

relationship_advice,fi6d0vr,t3_f6lj0o,1582188819.0,"Man, I'm going to be honest with you, as a woman who lived with her best friend and boyfriend at the same time. It does not work. You are in close proximity 24/7, and even if you don't think of your friend that way, it is going to eat your girlfriend alive. You are not only at an intimate proximity ALL THE TIME, you're closer to your friend than your girlfriend ALL the time.

My situation went south very, very fast.

But in general, no, a lot of women aren't going to be okay with this. The majority, probably. She is giving you the chance to not do it. I'd think long and hard on which decision is the right one.

Edit: no one asked, but for clarity:

I, 21F lived with my 20F best friend. Things were great. I met a 22M who started hanging around a lot. Cool. He's friends with my best friend, things are great. About 4 months in, my uncle passes away and I go out of town for the funeral. Since best friend's dad just passed, I ask boyfriend to watch my dog. He agrees. He's around 24/7 to keep tabs on best friend which is also a plus. Things are fine.

A few months later I walk in on boyfriend naked in best friend's room. A few months after that best friend moves out and - surprise - starts dating (now ex) boyfriend.

With that level of closeness, even if you guys have never even had a stray thought of being together, things change."
depression,fguxuqb,t1_fgu34x3,1581131898.0,"Hi hon! I just want to pop in and add to what was already said here. Pills for depression or anxiety a lot of times work the same way as pills for any other problem, like cholesterol! It's just a matter of what part of your body they're working on. Therapists will also take into account if you WANT to be on medications. If you're really against it, you can tell her that. But please don't feel like being put on a medication for depression is weird or scary. It's like taking medicine for anything else. You've got this!"
Effexor,fguwt1c,t3_f0ajrs,1581131199.0,"That is, unfortunately, the withdrawals. On the bright side, they typically ease up around day 5 - but they get worse before they get better. I recommend drinking a lot of water, taking benadryl for the brain zaps, and Zofran if you have it on hand for the nausea. If you're in a position where you can sleep through some of it, do. You've got this!

Edit: Medication names are hard."
Effexor,fguwkvl,t3_f0cwo3,1581131044.0,"This would typically be the point where a doctor would likely suggest upping your dosage. From what I understand, Venlafaxine does plateau off fairly quickly in terms of the body's tolerance to it - if I'm not mistaken, that's why the treatment plan typically just includes increasing doses. I'm at 150 and struggle with this because I don't want to increase it - I'm not sure I even want to be on it anymore to begin with."
Effexor,fguwdan,t3_f0ifvs,1581130904.0,"Personally, I've found taking it and then going and taking a nap is the best way to do it, but my body seems to have issues with accepting anything without sleep involved (meds, blood sugar, etc). Typically a few hours though."
Effexor,fguw8sl,t3_f0js66,1581130823.0,"It depends on how long you've been on it, how high your dose is, what your body's response to it is, and a lot of other factors. I get withdrawals anywhere from 2 to 12 hours late - if I forget, the withdrawals eventually remind me. It really depends. From what I've read though, your tolerance does level out eventually, which is why the long term treatment plan is typically to continue increasing dosages."
AskReddit,fg9taz3,t3_etbrdf,1580642888.0,"My dogs drink from the bathtub faucet. It started as my problem - German Shepherds drink a lot more water than my tiny pittie and my Boxer-Dane do. I had a refilling dish, but when the bottle was empty they would pick both up separately and fling the bottle and bowl around to let me know. It broke very quickly.

It was summer, and I realized the tap water would be colder anyway, so I let my bathtub drip and they drank from it and all was well.

Well, I don't think I'm breaking that habit anytime soon, and my bathroom floor is covered in muddy pawprints from them playing in the basement and then coming upstairs, getting their paws wet, and running away again."

I don't know who I am if I'm not depressed, isolating, and alone. I don't know who I am, what I'm like, what my real personality is. Even on antidepressants, I'm not sure this is who I really am. I'm scared of getting better because I don't know who I'll be then."
