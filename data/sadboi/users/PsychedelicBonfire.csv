BPD,fr6ds8b,t1_fr65zf2,1589924434.0,"You are right, there is the SPCA! I‚Äôm an idiot. I wouldn‚Äôt want to support a kill shelter, anyways.

Everyone in my industry I work with does some form of drug, as sad as it is. Sort of keeps me from getting closer to them. I am always looking ahead to meet new friends! I love meeting new people‚Äîit‚Äôs one of the things that keeps me going, honestly.

You are too kind, thank you! And I wish all the best for you. Truly. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
BPD,fr5drrh,t1_fr5a70v,1589906894.0,"Wow, thank you so much for this! It really means a lot!

Oddly enough, I DID interview for a job at an animal shelter a few years ago. I made it through and did a full day of (unpaid) training, but it became too much for me when they brought in a dead dog that needed to be handled... and then have it‚Äôs paw-print molded for the family. I love animals (leaps and bounds more than people), and I simply couldn‚Äôt handle it. I told the girl I was shadowing that I would be too upset to have to be surrounded by dead dogs. Even when my own pets pass, I can‚Äôt be around (I don‚Äôt even go to human funerals!). When they offered me the job, I declined. I could volunteer, but I also need the money. It was not strange advice, either! It was very thoughtful.

As far as friends go, I‚Äôve only told a handful about my struggles, but I don‚Äôt talk to them anymore (long story short: we were junkies, and now that I‚Äôm sober, I don‚Äôt associate with them). Over the years, my true friends all just stopped talking to me one by one. I was always the one to initiate contact/conversation, and I‚Äôm too stubborn to attempt now. I am of the belief that if someone stops talking to me and doesn‚Äôt reply a few times, that they‚Äôre done with me (for whatever reason) and I just let them go. I remain bitter and depressed, but whatever. No one helped me when I got out of the hospital the first time. No one talked to me, and I never bothered opening up further. That was when I was 18. I just stopped trying to get help. The Psychiatrists became too expensive, and my crummy health insurance only covered specialists that were too far for me to get to with no car (at the time). I was planning on going back to therapy this year, but... well, you know what happened there.

You‚Äôre right, though: I should really be relying on professionals for this type of stuff. I‚Äôm eager to get back into talking with someone about it. Sometimes, my emotions and episodes are too much of an onslaught for me to parse alone; it gets overwhelming. And my problems are much too much to burden the casual acquaintances I have now. Not that I see anyone outside of my immediately family ever. I‚Äôve only been out with someone other than a family member three times in the last year. I need to change. But not today. Today, I‚Äôm just not right.

Thank you again!"

This might sound a bit strange, but when I feel numb or sad (which is often), I go into the bathroom and smile at myself in the mirror. Just seeing myself smiling (or, just a smile in general) actually helps. It might not be the same for everyone, but it sometimes works for me."
