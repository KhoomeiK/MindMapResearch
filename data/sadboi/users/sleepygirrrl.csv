benzorecovery,fjrfsj3,t3_fetok4,1583584932.0,Just wanted to drop in and say I AM PROUD OF YOU. Quitting CT is not only risky but ridiculously hard. I started withdrawing from 10 years of Xanax use and I was honestly contemplating suicide. I could barely keep my job and school let alone live the rest of my life so I commend you for that. It’s going to be a tough ride but you have the right outlook and attitude for this. There is a life after benzo addiction ! I am looking forward to that right now. Good luck with everything :)
benzorecovery,fjqww2k,t3_fef6wn,1583578850.0,"In my own experience my GP did not feel comfortable tapering or even prescribing me any type of benzo. Unfortunately I went to 4 different psychs who said the same thing. I feel like they think I was just drug seeking. My advice is to look for a psych that specializes in addiction or benzos. The psychs that I went to all said they didn’t feel they were “the right fit for me” as they didn’t specialize in benzo addiction or tapering. If you can find a psych that does, that is probably your best bet unless you get lucky! Sending positive vibes your way, we can kick this awful shit !"
benzorecovery,fjquehg,t3_fermbc,1583577974.0,"I completely understand the desire to “check out” from life. I have been abusing my Xanax during taper for that reason, but like the comment above, the problems will still be there after the klonopin wears off. I highly suggest going to therapy. I know it sounds cheesy but it helps. All of the underlying problems that I used Xanax to mask never went away by using and therapy can help you with those. Benzos can’t. It’s like putting a band aid on a wound that needs months/years of healing. Relapsing will only send you down into a hole that is impossible to climb out of. I wish you the best and pm me if you ever need to talk."
benzorecovery,fjalrhs,t1_fjai3ba,1583175980.0,"Yeah, that’s why pressed bars have messed up my tapering so much, some I feel are semi-accurate in dosage and other are not. But as for the psychiatrist, like I said in my original post, I totally understand why he refused me as a client. From an outside perspective I would 100% a liability on his end and this is not the first doctor that has given me this response. I just wish they would emphasize and understand that buying bars off the street is the only other option besides CT which is just as dangerous. This doctor didn’t seem to give a fuck about this and encouraged me to keep buying off the street which I think is pretty fucked up. I’m ranting now but anyways thank you for your reply and advice !"
benzorecovery,fjah2ss,t1_fjaggvz,1583173357.0,"Well I feel you on the whole presses bars and uneven taper situation, I’ve been dealing with that for the past year.

benzorecovery,fjafura,t1_fjadk1k,1583172640.0,"Yeah I am planning on tapering on my own, but I have been trying to do so for the last 3 years. I’m gonna actually try this time because like you I would taper down and then say fuck it and take more for any little anxiety/depression. I’m hoping this time I will be able to do it on my own and if not I will be looking into ways to do detox/rehab. Just terrified of the withdrawals after jumping off. What dose were you at if you don’t mind me asking?"
benzorecovery,fj4xp6f,t3_fbbyk4,1583019401.0,"Thank you for doing this, I was put on Xanax at 18 years old 0.25mg a day, was not warned about the impact and dangers it could have on my life and now 10 years later I am having to take 4/5mg just to get through the day."
benzorecovery,fj4s30y,t1_fj4ko9r,1583015549.0,"Yes! I am actually planning on giving my pills to my boyfriend and having him give me my daily dose, because unfortunately I cannot trust myself when things gets hard. Sometimes taking just a little extra can be so easy when I feel my anxiety worsen and I hate that I can be so weak at times when it comes to Xanax. It’s just that my anxiety is so incredibly debilitating and when I am at work or school I feel helpless. Thank you so much for your reply and advice and I will keep you guys updated !"
benzorecovery,fj33qm5,t1_fj1s20f,1582965737.0,That is fucking ridiculous that they didn’t believe you were going through withdrawals. I don’t understand how some of the people even get to work in the medical field when they seem totally oblivious to information they should know about. I’m so sorry you had to go through that. The longest I have been off Xanax in 10 years was 2 months and everyday was absolute hell. I’m sorry to hear you still have symptoms. I’m absolutely terrified of how this is going to affect me long term once I get off :(
benzorecovery,fj333ja,t1_fj2ysy5,1582964831.0,I’m glad your GP helped you taper! Mine only suggested I go to hospital detox as well. I’ve had horrible luck with doctors.

Im also constantly yawning hence the username.
AskReddit,ffmzuxy,t1_ffk34gj,1580060584.0,"It was a miracle for my anxiety but I quickly grew physically and mentally dependent on them. 10 years later I am taking 4mg just to get rid of my anxiety. I started at 0.25mg....I have been trying to get off for over 2 years. Withdrawal can literally kill you and I had a seizure last year when trying to get off. Obviously every case is different so I am not saying this will happen to her. But the tolerance for Xanax develops extremely quickly and it is absolute hell to get off. If I wouldve known I would be addicted to it 10 years later, I never would’ve started taking it. It actually made my anxiety worse, my short term memory is shit and its caused me to become depressed. It’s just the worst drug to get dependent on. If she takes it short-term and responsibly, then she should be fine, but it’s extremely easy to take a little more when it stops working like it normally does and next thing you know you’re still taking it 10 years later. It a deep hole to climb out out of. I wish her the best."

benzorecovery,ffeicxd,t1_ffcvabh,1579849209.0,"Well he was only prescribing me a small dose of klonopin and Effexor for my depression. When I came clean to him about my Xanax usage, I was asking for his help with tapering off the Xanax and instead he told me I needed to go to hospital detox, lowered my klonopin dosage, told me to CT the Xanax and put me on Gabapentin to prevent withdrawal seizures. He was extremely rude and unempathetic as well."
benzorecovery,ffccxpr,t3_esuofc,1579796756.0,"You’re right when you say CT is not the way to go ! It’s awful and it’s dangerous. Make yourself a tapering schedule and try to stick to it as close as possible. It’s up to you how much you want to cut down by and how long to stay there but the slower and smaller is better and easier on your body. For example, each month cut cut down by .25mg. You can also follow the Ashton tapering manual. From my own experience, buying off friends/the street etc. is not always reliable and I always run out or dont have enough to taper properly so I decided to tell my psychiatrist. With him personally it did not go well, but I think you should tell your psychiatrist because it is easier with help. I know you feel hopeless right now. I have been on Xanax for almost 10 years and have been trying to get off for 2 and I have relapsed/upped my dosage many times. Anxiety is a bitch and it’s easy to give in. Try not to beat yourself up too much. You are human! I hope this helps :)"

I am taking the gabapentin because that is an extreme drop in dosage. I find it  pretty fucked up that basically all he is doing is preventing me from going into withdrawal and seizures. It seems like he doesn’t care that a drop in dosage like this will leave me with horrible anxiety every day but just wants to make sure I don’t die from a seizure due to the fact that he wouldn’t slow taper me .
benzorecovery,fdtct6r,t1_fdt1fje,1578714932.0,"I’ve had to buy it off the street as well as no one will prescribe it to me. It’s really unfortunate. As long as you taper very slowly you don’t have to worry about seizures. As far as I know they can only occur during withdrawl when you completely stop taking the Xanax.

My biggest piece of advice: STAY AWAY FROM BENZODIAZEPINES if you ever get prescribed any medication."
Anxiety,fddpioh,t3_eku8vd,1578320464.0,"I feel you! My anxiety gives me chest tightness, headaches, muscle tightness dizziness, nausea etc. In high school I dealt with the same reaction from my parents. I’m not sure how old you are but I would suggest sitting them down and talking to them and letting them know the seriousness of the issue. Or if you are able to go to a doctor on your own I would advise to do that. You could also talk to the nurse at your school, but I would definitely advise to talk to someone about this. Sometimes even doing just that and having support and understanding can be helpful in this situation. In my experience, these symptoms will not go away on their own. Look into breathing techniques, meditation and exercise to help with your anxiety. Although these may not work for everyone, they are worth trying. I wish you the best !"

I was running across the yard to my friends car and tripped because of a sprinkler hole.  I fell and skidded so hard it pulled my pants down. My dad and 4 friends were doing some construction work in my driveway. I just laid face down ass up in the grass crying while they laughed their asses off.

Number two:

I was eating a Thai restaurant and it was very packed. Me and my boyfriend were eating next to a family with a little daughter. I was trying to pull off a shrimp tail while the rest was in my mouth and the tail flew and landed on her shoulder. She immediately started crying. Her parents just glared at me.

After soaking, throw it in a rice cooker with some fresh water and a small square (3x3) of kombu. I did 3 cups of rice and 3 cups of water. 

After cooking, put rice into a wood or metal bowl and this is when you add the rice vinegar, sugar and salt. I don’t like my sushi rice too seasoned so I use about a 1/4 cup of rice vinegar, 1 1/2 tbsp of sugar and a 1/2 tsp of kosher salt.
