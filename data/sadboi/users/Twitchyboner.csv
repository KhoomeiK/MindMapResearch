mentalillness,fq5gzm9,t3_gggi9p,1589105049.0,"Yes, I've felt this pain for years. It's true, when you love yourself.. you express confidence and positive vibes when you do. People are attracted to that, not the negative depressed monster we have kept inside locked up in a cage. Before I had a mental illness, I had lots of different girls.. as soon as I grew older, life happened, I lost my mojo.

All you can do is put on the best mask you can, and wear it like you stole it. Fake it till you make it, hate the saying.. but it's so true. That's really how you will attract someone, by being the best positive self you can."
mentalillness,fq5gf1h,t3_ggxza0,1589104416.0,"They throw it at your face and use it as an insult? Sounds like you're attracting the wrong kinda of people. I would like to think, that these days mental illness is starting to get the stigma lifting a little, but nothing will get rid of it.

It always broke my heart, and something I don't have too much experience with myself personally, I have felt the urge one time.. but never followed through. Yet for me, it was a self hate feeling and being restless that caused it. All I can say is try to find therapy to deal with your self hate, you need to talk about someone in person or over the phone. It's important, do it."
mentalillness,fpj175i,t3_gdq6t3,1588653789.0,"Seems like the most stress I am getting from this is your husband's violent behaviour. This really needs to be resolved, resorting to violence and destroying things is a no go. That's abuse, and would be taken a massive toll on you. I would try to address these problems, and talk one on one with each other to work out your issues. 

Having anxiety and being insecure is something I deal with on a daily basis. Dressing up and how we look, has a huge impact on how people perceive and judge us. This is just life, what we feel inside can help overcome this feeling. The not giving a fuck vibe is a great way to develop, developing thoughts where you train yourself not to care what people think about you is very important, but a very hard thing to do in practise. 

I highly recommend finding ways to deal with your anxiety with medication, that can really help."
mentalillness,fpj0h4f,t3_gdq9uv,1588653251.0,"I get this feeling in my stomach, yet I don't want to stab it.. I want to try to nurture it.. and find out why I am feeling this way. Wanting to stab yourself really doesn't sound healthy.

Anyway can you take anti-anxiety medication? Valium helps me chill out, but that's a short term go to. What makes you want to stab yourself? Is there a self hate feeling going on?"
mentalillness,fpizpos,t3_gdq658,1588652679.0,"They are usually harmless, and are only there to absorb your negative energy. I used to get visits from them years ago, and they didn't bother me that much. Try using protection or praying to worshipping positive energies or deities that may help your anxiety and helping you sleep. (Depending on your beliefs of course)

Just remember, they are harmless.. they really are. They may be evil, nor not.. but they are purely there to fead on your fear and negative energy. I haven't been visited by one in years.. it will pass."
depression,fpiyvuk,t3_gdozao,1588652067.0,"In Australia, we have a public system where seeing case workers and psychiatrists are free. And with a medical referral, you can get 10 sessions to see a psychologist. 

However, my mental illness is quite severe to the point of me getting private insurance and yeah, each session is $220 with getting some money back from that.

So in some cases, we are lucky here that our Health services are generally very good and can help patients once they have left hospital or vice versa. 

But since you're in America, it's always been an on going debate for years as to why the American government feeds more money into the military services rather than the general wellbeing of their citizens with health care. It's such a disgrace against human life."

mentalillness,fp5kqe6,t3_gbfzwx,1588332799.0,"Well, sounds like what it's like to have bi-polar. In my case, mood swings and not being able to move forward from the past is all apart of the illness. The ghost hidden in the closet, so to speak. I also did the same thing in my early teenage years, became something I wasn't.. smoking drugs, lying and hiding it all. I don't quite understand, what you were trying to say with being different people from movies? Playing different scenarios in your head?  Look, I'm still in the fight myself. I recommend listening to good music, that helps like therapy. Looking into yourself spiritually can help, and I don't mean religion, I mean look into yourself and rediscover your purpose and meaning. Buddism, and the gurus that have come from that philosophy can help a lot aswell, tons of wise wisdom. 

Medication is 'supposedly' meant to help with those mood swings so give that a shot, along with therapy."
mentalillness,fp5jthg,t3_gbf246,1588331926.0,"Ah dude, my mother has Bipolar and I grew up being neglected.. so I can relate to a degree but not quite like your situation. I would recommend taking medication to be honest, Seroquel should do the trick and give you guys both a good nights rest as it can be very sedative. Then I would seek professional help about getting off the weed, as this can make mental illness worse. I know if I spark a joint, or smoke a bong.. I'll start seeing spirits with my third eye again. Sorry this has happened to you man, I have been through similar experiences, you're not alone."

Fight the beast inside, and seek the light."
mentalillness,fp5j7ki,t3_gbe2we,1588331319.0,"I know exactly how you are feeling. I am tormented by my past too, people, memories and trauma from those times.. and even how people perceive me today. I also don't feel myself because of medication changes and so forth, but all I can say is try to find the strength inside to continue. At the moment, listening to music and writing poetry is keeping me going. Try to be creative as possible with how you feel, try to stimulate the mind just a little. I have trouble sleeping too, I rely on Seroquel to help me out. 

I feel like a failure and a idiot too, but you have to find your way back home. Find your purpose, connect with yourself spiritually, connect with others.. Don't isolate yourself, don't give in to the darkness, don't let it eat it up at you."
mentalillness,fp5imcy,t3_gb44nr,1588330723.0,"It helps to meet people who are also going through the same thing. I recommend reaching out to services where you can speak to someone over the phone, or meet up in person to discuss and socialise with someone with lived in experience. I am lucky to have 3 friends I can count on and understand and accept my illness. It takes meeting the right people, and adjusting/bettering your mental health."

depression,fommlwm,t3_g8bfkl,1587895803.0,"I highly recommend going into hospital and sorting out the self harming. Speak with doctors and try to work towards getting good therapy to deal with your thoughts and emotions. Next is medication, hopefully you can find something that can work with changing the chemicals in your brain. Lithium worked for me when I was in a real dark place of being catatonic and suicidal. It's a shame your not close with your family, you need alot of support from people being in such a place.. I really hope you can see the light. xx"
mentalillness,foi3tt6,t1_fog7uqr,1587778152.0,"Well coming to a mental illness forum is a great start, being able to communicate with people that understand.. Like Matthew said, it can help to have someone that has a mental illness that you can vent too. I'm lucky some of my friends have it, so I can always lean on their shoulder. Try a phone call service that maybe be of some use, trying a different medication. These feelings are so hard to overcome, I have Bipolar.. so my moods change alot.. but I've mostly been depressed my whole life now, so sometimes the clouds disappear.. then sometimes they come back.. Good luck! xx"

Honestly if this is turning into a Manic episode it does need to be treated. You mite be okay if you do the right things to stop yourself from going to hospital, but don't be too quick not to use that option. I know it's a hard decision, but things could get worse. Personal experience, every time I feel what you're describing.. it gets worse and may need to be treated.  Tweaking the medication may be another option... you're not alone x"
mentalillness,fof5web,t3_g755p2,1587727130.0,"I can definitely emphasize with you feeling lonely, hollow and empty at the moment. I have this incredible sense of being so calm, yet so sad inside. My dad's side of the family doesn't really understand mental illness, they are very happy go go. So yes, I sometimes also struggle to express how I really feel with them regarding my depression. It really sounds like you need to talk to a counsellor, or better yet a psychologist. It would be handy if you actually had a friend you could express how you're really feeling, or having that someone to vent to. Honestly though, you should be upfront with your family. You shouldn't feel guilty for how you are feeling. I believe it's actually quite normal, and ideally your family should be more supportive to you. Open up to your parents, and have a serious discussion about it.

\- Get on top of your mental health

\- See a professional, seek different therapy

\- Try medication, sounds like its depression.

\- Keep being open with your family on how you're feeling."

The things that got me out of it, was hospital.. and the right medication to balance the chemicals. (Lithium) Listening to good music, and having good company around helps. Make sure you go for walks at least once or twice day to get out of your apartment. Find meaning and purpose with your life.. Finding your own Spirituality can help give you some meaning.. What we go through isn't worth it, but what we receive is empathy of our suffering. Make something of it, if you can... I'm trying too."

If you're feeling suicidal, I really recommend you go into hospital and see if being there may help. I know I was suicidal when I was 22, and once I was admitted.. over time, with the help of the right medication.. the chemicals in your brain will change and things will get better. You just have to fight it through these low points, and find the right medication will hopefully help... x"
mentalillness,fny01ui,t3_g4gwar,1587350178.0,"Well feeling empty is just another gateway to Depression, so establishing a good doctor with therapy and the right medication may make a world of difference. It's great you've got 3 birds to look after, giving you a sense of purpose besides work. You may not need to go into hospital only if you get worse, but try to see if you can fix this before you resort to hospital."
mentalillness,fnxl7b7,t3_g4h1e5,1587340951.0,"Yes I am in the same vote. Even before when I socialised with friends just before this happened, I only went out of the house because I was so damn restless. And I did not enjoy myself at all. This isolation is nothing new to me, I've done 3 months in a psychward, so being isolated is helping me regather myself and my mental health at home.

Everyone experiences some form of depression in their lives and trust me some are worse then others. My personal depression has lead me to be 'Catatonic' and suicidal. Most people believe depression is about just about being sad, or feeling sorry for one's self. It's really not, it starts by entering a realm of not caring or loving yourself or life. You lose all pleasure in everyday activities, there's an overwhelming sense of defeat, shame and pain that can lead to suicide in many experiences. Getting out of bed is probably the hardest because you don't want to live life anymore but exist for various reasons. Everything is a chore to do, even feeding yourself.. dressing yourself, showering yourself.. Anything to do with aiding yourself for each day is compromised. You simply lose all vest for life and all it's joy that comes with it. Can you get over depression? Well it depends how bad it is, in most cases medication and lifestyle changes if you can do that, yes can combat the depression and may turn it away. But if it's really bad, yeah.. medication and just hope that the chemicals in the brain balance out so you can get joy, so you can actually live life. Being productive of course makes you feel better, yet again depending on how depressed the person is.. your not going to see much productive work being done.

Depression is mainly caused by passed Trauma and the genetic makeup of your genes plays a role. I honestly hate talking about genes, but they do play a part in Mental illness. If your parent suffers from a condition, depending on your life choices you could also get it. I obtained mine by smoking drugs and hanging out with idiots that triggered my first major depressive episode. Depression is the black dog, it's like a pet.. it will always be around in most peoples lives who suffer the most, and they must look after it before it consumes them entirely."
