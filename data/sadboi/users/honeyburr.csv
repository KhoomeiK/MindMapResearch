The accent alone did 70% of the work, most people thought I was ‘exotic’ not knowing I grew up in Gateshead haha (chav central). 2/3 of customers told me about their trip to London, so a smile and nod through that rounded it up to that 20% tip. Honestly though, people aren’t predictable, sometimes it really does not mater how nice you are. The tipping system is fucked but the best way to increase it is simple, lots of smiles, lots of respect."

Different types of therapy to research, if you feel the need, are EDMR therapy, DBT therapy, CBT therapy.
