HumansAreMetal,f8c5he8,t3_dxo521,1574452902.0,"So, I'm going to say that it is not possible for Hong Kong to win, but it is entirely possible for China to lose.

Look at Vietnam and, more recently, the Taliban. They've said, on record, that they're just waiting for the US to give up.

Hide, cause a few casualties on holidays, hide again. Do this until the public is tired of hearing about it.

You can't fight China like an army; you have to act as an insurgency."
marketing,eyd3yoe,t3_cwmhpn,1567010807.0,"I would change your ""sampling"" strategy to an event-based one. If you're an independent coffee shop, I'm assuming you're trying to reach a higher-income clientele.

If you're giving away samples, you're cheapening your brand. You're not Baskin Robin's. Maybe host tasting events (as was mentioned above) but include your own coffee.

Either that, or offer coffee flights, so that people can sample your blends in a fun way. Pair it with some food to cleanse the pallette and you have yourself one hell of a premium product."

gonewild,ey9k14x,t3_clkdoz,1566945188.0," I do graphic design and want to make some NSFW pictures. If anyone wants to take a well-lit photo against a white background, I can turn it into something stylized and cool, then send it back to you.

Either that, or if I could have permission to use a photo already posted, that would be fine, too. I don't want to just yank photos off of Reddit without permission. That's pretty creepy.

If you can't find a full white background, that's fine. It'll just take longer.

Also, high res photos will come out better. Sharp lines will vector much better."

Witcher3,ewg3y4o,t3_cn56w8,1565373366.0,"I tried to play it for a few years, but always got overwhelmed when I got to Velen.

Finally tried it again, and didn't go question mark chasing and wow! I can't think of a better game. So much time and attention went into it! The side quests have better writing than other games' main quests, and the characters are all very well-developed.

I'm mad at myself for not giving this game a fair shake earlier."
depression,ew510ys,t1_ew4zcgu,1565124136.0,"Thank you, too. At the end of the day, we all stare the at same monster in the eyes. I don't think what brought us to it makes a difference. 

I hope that you find your way, man. I hate the situation I'm in, and I really think we weren't meant for society."
depression,ew4ysz7,t3_cmv477,1565122031.0,"If you think you're in danger, it doesn't matter what anyone thinks. We have a dangerous desease.

Granted, the passing thought is common, even for those that aren't depressed (staring into the void and all that) but actually wanting to do it, or thinking about how you would, is a big warning sign.

Your life is the most precious thing on this earth. Please don't take it away.

Also, not a Doctor. This isn't medical advice."
depression,ew4yabn,t1_ew4os1m,1565121557.0,"Surely.

My first major depressive episode was when I was in high school. It got so bad that I dropped out, but I still didn't know I had depression at that point. 

Gathered enough will to sit for a few hours and get my GED. I didn't know what to do after, and I was running away from an abusive family, so I joined the military. 

Surprisingly enough, I thrived in Afghanistan. I never felt depressed and actually felt whole. I was surrounded by people that treated me like family. 

Yes, some bad things happened, and yes, survivors guilt is not a good mix with depression. I think the prospect of dying is what really drew me to keep going. 

I got hurt, couldn't deploy anymore, kept myself afloat mentally for long enough to get a degree and now I work in Marketing, but I definitely cannot do it without antidepressants."
depression,ew4q7s7,t3_cmsvv4,1565116003.0,"I'm not a doctor, but it sounds like you are. The worst part of treatment is that it takes forever to find what works.

This puts a lot of people off, since depression leaves you with the ""what's the point"" mentality a lot. So, my advice is to get back into therapy and to stick with it. There will be something that helps you. It just takes patience."
depression,ew4n8vx,t3_cmskv4,1565114214.0,"How does a nicotine withdrawal feel? Depression is different for everyone, but there are some general symptoms.

If you feel fatigued, and lose interest and motivation to do things, it's a good sign.

There are other signs for other types of depression, but those are the most common. Also, I'm not a doctor and only a doctor can tell you if you do or not."

depression,ew3vwne,t3_cmmstv,1565096408.0,"I get the same thing! When I was in the military, officers would put me in leadership positions because of how I brought morale up. I think it's a combination of needing outside validation (since we can't be nice to ourselves) and, in my case, our ability to cope with things.

Nothing can get you down if you're always down. This is why a lot of people with depression are funny, too. It's a coping mechanism."
