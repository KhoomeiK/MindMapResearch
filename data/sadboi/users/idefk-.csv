Anxiety,fpohx5z,t1_fpobvhm,1588784790.0,"Aw that sucks, I seen a fly in my room and had to sleep on the couch multiple times before for a few days. And I got a feeling that I need to clean my room but I couldnâ€™t cause I was scared. And at my old house I had like a chocolate flower thing I got after a dance performance and I was just looking at it. I randomly felt like bugs were in it and I started singing things so I threw it and started freaking out. It sounds dramatic but itâ€™s so scary. Idek why, I think Iâ€™m just scared of being disgusting. If I see a bug I get the urge to clean my body. Like I was giving my cat treats the other night and they were seafood. They were there for a while and anyway worms were in his treats so I ran out of the kitchen started hyperventilating and texted my mom. For a second I thought I could of been seeing things but my mom said itâ€™s just worms so I knew it was real. Then I needed to wash myself but it was late so I didnâ€™t feel ok taking a bath or anything. So I washed my arms up to my elbow with soap then washed everything else just with water, got changed and I didnâ€™t eat or go in the kitchen for the rest of the night. I also normally have my door open in the night cause pitch black scares me but I didnâ€™t want my cat in. So I closed my door and left my light on till the sun started rising."
Anxiety,fpoa02p,t1_fpms5ox,1588780943.0,Aw same I donâ€™t mind animals eating them itâ€™s only really if theyâ€™re in my house unless thereâ€™s a pet that eats bugs. But thatâ€™s probably because I was always big with animals so i didnâ€™t mind what they need if that makes sense. If I see one in my house I start hyperventilating and yea theyâ€™re just scary.

Pets,fmt6w66,t3_fx6bo5,1586367823.0,Yep I hate when people say that. Especially if they act like they know everything and make stuff up. When I was younger I used to hold my cat in my arms which she didnâ€™t mind. My other cat Ik didnâ€™t like it so I wouldnâ€™t do it. This one would literally purr and just stay she was obviously perfectly content. And my Nanâ€™s sister was babysitting me and my brothers and she seen me do it and told me to stop Iâ€™m hurting her and that sheâ€™s mad. I said she isnâ€™t and she always did that then she said no sheâ€™s waggy her tail sheâ€™s mad. Like wtf k if she was mad sheâ€™d be scratching me not calmly staying. And I had her for like 6 years and treated her the same since she was ok with me. So I think Ik what my cat wants.
Pets,fmsv4fj,t1_fmsmwpr,1586362480.0,Yea I will I also follow someone on Instagram who has a lot so i could ask him questions. But Ofc Iâ€™ll still do a lot more than just that. Is there any sites or anything you recommend?

Pets,fmq08vz,t1_fmq047j,1586290527.0,Ok thank you
RATS,fmpxmq3,t1_fmpcrne,1586289190.0,Yea that was a grammatical error one of the first things I checked is if they should be alone or not. Also I think that Iâ€™d be ok to get a few next year since I stay with my mom now and sheâ€™ll listen to me if they need anything. Iâ€™ll also be starting career in school so Iâ€™ll be able to make money that way. But idrk if Iâ€™m going to get anything or not or if itâ€™ll be a rat. It was just a thought. I was just gonna get a hamster but when I had one when I was little my dad had the room too cold and I live in Canada so it froze and died. So Iâ€™ve been scared to get one cause I just associate them with dying fast. And by dying fast I mean in like a month and I wouldnâ€™t wanna pay $10 for a pet thatâ€™ll last 3 weeks when I can get one that lasts 2 years for the same price. But Ik that they normally live longer Iâ€™m just worried. I think since Iâ€™m away from him and everything that happened even besides the pets Iâ€™d be more smart with them. Cause tbh I think I did a bad job at taking care of them but I did everything I could and did all the research I could I just couldnâ€™t really control their food. Since Iâ€™m away from my dad now I could easily feed them whatever I want. Instead of going off of what he says and thinks. And if I mentioned he did anything wrong heâ€™d probably get mad at me so. I had no control.
RATS,fmpc86u,t1_fmls19w,1586278253.0,I had three all the same age and all female. And ok thanks. My dad always bought that kind and itâ€™s also the cheapest so just wondering.
RATS,fmpbzgr,t1_fmmdsel,1586278128.0,"I did before getting them. I had three at a time, I tried to keep them as healthy as possible but my dad didnâ€™t really listen to me. And he would buy that food for the rats which I didnâ€™t really like just because seemed bad so I was just wondering. I donâ€™t think I did that bad at taking care of them not to sound selfish but I feel like my dad was the only problem. He always acted like he knows everything about animals. So he sometimes takes over especially since back then I switched houses. Like I wanted to go to my friends house but my rat was sick so I was gonna stay home and my dad convinced me to go and I told him to hand feed her because she was having trouble eating on her own and she was slow. And the other two would try to steal her food but my dad didnâ€™t even though he said he would multiple times. Might sound dramatic Ik and Iâ€™ll admit maybe I did do things wrong. Iâ€™ve only had those 3. Sorry if I said anything wrong."
RATS,fmpb9yh,t1_fmnzhjp,1586277777.0,"Thatâ€™s what I thought, thanks"
RATS,fmlpezm,t3_fw1tu2,1586190790.0,If not Iâ€™ll buy Oxbow Essentials because my other rats had that unless my dad bought the food. And I heard good things about it. The one I was talking about Iâ€™m not sure tho cause I canâ€™t find much on it. So Iâ€™m probably not gonna get it but if itâ€™s good why not.
