4 cups mushroom stock 
3/4 cup Arborio rice
2 cloves garlic, minced 
1 shallot, minced 
1 lemon, zested and quartered for easy squeezing
8 oz diced and roasted butternut squash 
Scallops, patted dry and seasoned generously with salt and pepper 
1/4 cup Parmesan
Olive oil

Sauté garlic and shallot in a bit of olive oil until soft
Add rice and sauté until translucent 
Start adding in hot stock, 1/2 cup at a time and stirring constantly until almost absorbed. Repeat with the rest of the stock. Took about 25 minutes. I recommend drinking wine and listening to Spotify during this time
Add in lemon zest, Parmesan and however much lemon juice you’d like to the risotto and season with salt and pepper to taste
Heat some oil until it’s getting so hot you’re getting nervous. Add the scallops and sear each side about 90 seconds 
Eat too much, enjoying every moment and go to bed full and happy"
