hsp,fq9s807,t3_ghivr8,1589205967.0,"Hey, I was in the US Navy at one point and made it through Basic. I thought I'd cry all the time and get my feelings hurt. In reality, I got in trouble for laughing and joking around too much So it wasn't at all the way I thought it'd be. I can't explain why it didn't bother me or how I dealt with it. It's like the environment is just like that and you know what to expect, so it doesn't feel out of place or unpredictable. It's what they're supposed to do, so I didn't let it affect me.

However, I did experience anxiety when having to do some stuff in the pool. Floating prone for however long. I freaked out there, but I made it through. Same with a situation where we had to wear like firefighter gear? We had big heavy masks on and I freaked out, screaming I couldn't breathe. The instructor was pretty mean about it but it actually helped snap me out of it. He yelled, ""\[Jordan\]! You're not dying. You're fucking fine. If you couldn't breathe, you couldn't scream. Just shut up, stop. Because you're FINE. Just try it. See? You can breathe."" He hated my group lol but as harsh as that response sounds, it did help.   


I don't know. I guess HSPs are also highly adaptive and at first, it's super scary to have random people yelling at you. But you quickly adapt and know that's what it'll be like and in a way that makes it easier.  


I, for one, was the favorite person to stand watch when higher military officials came through because I was pretty booksmart and was the only one who could nail all the questions. I am not saying that to brag but to show you that there's something I excelled at. I also became the mail person? Don't remember what it was called, but I felt helpful and showed my interest in leading, helping, etc. I was 19 or 20 at the time and very naive, so I don't know how it would be if I were older and more weathered because of more negative experiences.

Edit: a word"
productivity,foy4u0m,t1_fox5f10,1588165335.0,"Yeah that's an important distinction. I think you definitely need downtime. I don't think any human can be 100%  productive, but I don't know if successful people have entire days or weeks that they ""take off"". I wouldn't know! From all the millions of articles and books on the topic, you'd think they don't ever take a day off.

I know what you mean about social media. Hell, I'm checking Reddit on my work computer because I don't want to do the next thing I'm supposed to do on my task list. I don't know what I thought this would accomplish. I'm learning that there's an interesting relationship between dopamine and attention span, and I've trained myself to go for quick dopamine hits, as opposed to delayed gratification. I'm trying to-retrain that.

Also, I find myself wanting to get on social media to share my opinions and takes on things because I crave interaction/connection. I don't know how else to meaningfully get that right now. Perhaps controlled social media time, sort of how you do it after you get your work done, is a better approach. I certainly don't want to quit SM altogether, just use it more mindfully."
productivity,fovvy5q,t3_g9f0ob,1588108469.0,"Yep totally agree about the waves. Although, most people are saying this is normal and to just ride it out. But extremely successful people don't just ride it out, do they? They find a way to overcome it or use the waves to their advantage, right? I'd imagine they do. Can you imagine some successful person you look up to just not being super productive and outputting their product/service/whatever it is? They wouldn't be where they are, I imagine.

So I think a lot of us feel incompetent because of this since there's this culture around productivity that we have to keep ""getting gains"" and to keep ""hustling"" and to ""never give up"" in order to get what we want. If we falter, we feel like failures. I certainly do. I struggle to not feel that way. I'm practicing self-compassion about it.

But I'm also investigating why I struggle to motivate myself. Is it a lack of motivation or is something else stealing my drive and energy? What specifically is making me just want to play video games the rest of the day? I like what another user said about self-determination theory and having all your base needs met first. Of course, if I play video games or watch TV first, I'll inevitably struggle to work out or do any mental work after that. So there's got to be a balance. I'm personally doing a smartphone and social media detox to see if I can sort of get back some of my attention span that's been lost to the instant gratification that constant Reddit, Twitter, and Facebook access has given me.

Edit: Oops, self-determination theory, not self-discipline theory."

I skipped them too, have for awhile, and took it continuously for the same reason. But after having more trouble with spotting, I asked about it and they said it’s possibly the pill itself and taking it continuously.

I need to watch part 2 of the last season again though because a lot of it is hazy for me. I wish we did have two extra seasons to flesh things out more. Like I wanted to see more of what happened to everyone! Especially Diane. The jump forward in time felt so jarring and I felt like I was scrambling to feel closure. That was my initial takeaway was that I felt far too attached and not ready to let go. If they initially planned 2 more seasons though that makes sense.

I’m glad Bojack faced consequences. He deserved it even if he was making strides to be better. He also chose to relapse. However, to end with this implication that he probably won’t see Diane again, once his best friend, and that he’s going back to prison felt so final to me. I wanted a gleam or hope. I wanted to know there’s hope for someone like him (because maybe there’s hope for us all). Not saying I agree with any of his actions or even like him half the time, but I think I was rooting for him to get better, be better, and deal with the consequences and then move on with his life. Instead of spiraling and ending up no better than where he started.

Like I said, I may need to rewatch it. With that new perspective it might hit me differently. But I overall just adore the show. It’s clever and fun, but it handles dark topics so well.

selfimprovement,fmjhz6y,t3_fvl11z,1586130686.0,"I don’t have ADHD, but I have struggled with depression, attention/focus, low mood and energy, joint pain, always tired, often “sick” but with no real symptoms, and foggy brain. We may not have super similar backgrounds or situations but I can try to share what’s worked for me.

Again keep in mind that this worked for me for those symptoms I mentioned. Everyone is different.

-L-theanine: helps with focus and anxiety. It is not habit forming or addictive in any way. It’s an amino acid from green tea. I take one or two capsules after my coffee most days.

-Ashwaghanda: this is another natural supplement, an Indian root, that also helps with focus and anxiety. I find it to be more potent than l-theanine. It also has a very safe drug profile. It causes headaches sometimes though. I have to stay extra hydrated too. I think it makes me more thirsty? But it really helps me focus. Maybe too much. I find I sometimes focus too much on the wrong thing. But I’ve heard anecdotal stories that it helps ADHD. Again, I don’t have it but I do sometimes struggle to dive in and stay focused so this stuff is awesome.

-magnesium: if you research this yourself, you will find that 350mg is the recommended dose if you take a supplement. Otherwise, it’s best to get from food. I took a 500mg supplement without knowing this and ended up getting a mild overdose after a week that made me more depressed and more tired. It does help depression symptoms though when taken in proper dose. I get it from diet alone now but not everyone likes this approach.

-turmeric: for inflammation. Works great for tired, achey joints. Also some studies link depression to inflammation in the brain. So, bonus!

-diet for better mood, more energy, and no more brain fog: I personally had a terrible diet. I tried to incorporate more vegetables and swapped out for whole grains, but my carb intake was far too high. I found out I was insulin-resistant because of PCOS, and so I had to go on a low carb diet. Not advocating or preaching that everyone should go low carb, but no one needs refined carbs like pizza and pasta every day like I was doing lol. Whole grains and adding a lot more veggies and good proteins, while limiting or removing foods with added sugar or refined carbs will be enough for most people. I had more energy, physical and mental, my mood was more even, and it eliminated my brain fog! There are legit studies out there about how sugar affects the mind and body. It was eye opening to me.

-exercise: I love me some yoga. And the gym when that reopens. I do it to get stronger, more flexible, and better than I was yesterday. Not just to lose weight. It helps with my mood and gives me energy. I know that’s the typical advice but for me I had to ease into it and find things I really enjoyed and give myself short term goals. I get lost in long term goals and discouraged. 

I wish I could give you organizational tips/life advice. I mean I could. But I don’t have ADHD so I don’t want to give you useless advice there. Good luck, friend!"

BPD,flz1thf,t1_flyqoy3,1585613696.0,"My original post is obsessing about his comment on the photo and feeling like it was critical. But after talking to another Redditor in here, I’m worried about my response to him. I said, “it’s one slice of bacon! I’ll be alright.” Or something like that. I wonder if that sounded too callous or something, if he was indeed well-meaning. Lol it seems silly now but I sometimes have trouble gauging appropriate responses"
BPD,fly2bmz,t1_flxu1i0,1585594242.0,"Also that was bullshit that your manager said that to you about potato chips. Well meaning or not, that was weird"

BPD,flxre6m,t1_flxnjwe,1585588393.0,"Thank you for this perspective. That is how I took it. ESPECIALLY since he has gained weight over the years and doesn’t seem to watch what he eats at all. He may have recently had a change of tune or been to the doctor and warned about saturated fats/heart disease. Maybe he has high cholesterol. But his opinion on my food wasn’t warranted, asked for, and it felt like criticism.

But like I said in the other comments here I’m trying to not take it personally and let it roll. Easier said than done!

Edit I should mention ive collaborated with him on projects but don’t work directly with him anymore so I don’t know his daily life, hence all the speculation and why a comment like that out of nowhere feels even more unnecessarily personal"
BPD,flxa814,t1_flx9iv4,1585578763.0,That’s a really good point. Looking at it through the lens of gratitude. I’ve recently learned the benefits of gratitude by way of journaling so I love that you framed it that way!
selfhelp,flx8l4h,t3_frpw5k,1585577728.0,"Hey I’m with you. I have a history of childhood abuse and I have grown up all my life with shitty self esteem, inability to let stuff go, internalizing other people’s opinions, and being a total perfectionist. None of it makes me happy of course, but I can’t let go nonetheless. Learning to ride the human waves of emotions is not easy, but it’s simple.

As someone with BPD, I’ve practiced a lot of emotion regulation. Specifically with DBT skills. Skills like mindfulness and learning when to distract myself VS when to self-soothe, etc. you can google DBT skills and read up on them online for free and even find worksheets.

Also working on self-esteem has been huge for me. Having healthy self esteem means you don’t need outside approval or accomplishments to fill the void. You’re secure in who you are and no one else can sway that. You have healthy boundaries and accept yourself as is, flaws and all. I’m not at that level but doing self esteem exercises have been extremely helpful. One I’m doing now is “positives diary”. Each day, writing one thing I enjoyed, one thing I achieved that I’m proud of (big or small), and one positive trait I showed. Sounds simple and kind of dumb at first but I didn’t realize how much I brushed off and dismissed about myself. It’s a way to objectively list things you’ve done and like, while also appreciating them about yourself with no judgments. There are other tips I encourage you to look up! I bought my workbook/guide for $8 through Barnes and Noble and it’s been fantastic but I’ve used free resources too."
BPD,flx7eez,t1_flx5f2n,1585576940.0,"I appreciate your outside perspective! It’s hard not to be offended by every little thing but it is something I’m working hard on. I just wish my brain would take yes for an answer, so to speak. Like I’ve logically thought this through and it’s no big deal! Calm down. Haha but it’s not that easy. However, your comment has helped and I hope my response wasn’t too callous or rude. I tried to have a moderate answer that wasn’t defensive or overly explanatory. That’s another issue I have. Appropriate Responses.

Anyway I hope you have a lovely day!"
lonely,flx2jb8,t1_flw7zjt,1585573395.0,"I wish I could tell you it gets better. I’m 31 and I still feel like I’ve wasted my time. I felt old at 17, similar to you. I had no direction, felt shitty and useless. I’ve done things I’m happy about and proud of and others I’m not so happy about. I want to believe my life isn’t over and that it gets better. I’m not dead yet! I’m working on self esteem and self compassion, hoping that deals with some of that issue.

I’m sorry this isn’t a more positive or inspiring comment. I’d like to go back to therapy and work on some of the core, underlying issues that might make me think that. Maybe that would help you too if you’re able? Therapy is hard though. That’s why I do a lot of self help while I’m in between excuses for not going back"

selfhelp,flusm58,t3_fr2hbk,1585509184.0,"Lymph nodes can swell at any sign of infection, and it may be because of this that you don’t feel sick (because they’re fighting any intruders). Mine often feel tender without me feeling ill. I recently learned that lymph nodes release bacteria-fighting cells, so it’s not necessarily a bad thing if they feel painful or swollen. They’re just doing their job. Just keep an eye out for any other symptoms just in case. Flu is still going around where I am.

Edit for clarity"
getdisciplined,fltz66t,t1_fltte9t,1585491421.0,I hope that’s not what they meant. No way I have 6 hours of free time when I get home from work. I guess you just have to adjust it based on your available time.

needadvice,flohhzc,t3_fq2dps,1585338406.0,"If classes were still in session, you’d stay and pay that amount right? I’d say just stay and pay it because mental sanity is worth more. As someone with mental health problems who couldn’t wait to escape their family, I would do anything to avoid returning. Money really isn’t everything. If you were in dire straits, I might reconsider my opinion but it seems the idea is saving money vs spending what you would have normally spent during the school year. If you’re concerned about money you could always get a part time/temporary job. Don’t go back! At least that’s what I would do"
DecidingToBeBetter,flnxxoa,t1_flnv1ts,1585327979.0,Yeah exactly. That’s disturbing that they would want to be total dicks for shits and giggles. I guess that is the power fantasy. Everyone’s big and bad on the internet

PCOS,flns5mx,t1_flnimpd,1585324836.0,"You’re right, he has to want to change. It’s good you were able to accept your ex the way she was. I am accepting my bf but do want to keep encouraging him to make better choices, for all those reasons you mentioned!

It’s great so many people see such good results with ovasitol. I think price has been a bit of a prohibitive factor but I’d love to see some improvements. Sounds like there’s still those symptoms that won’t go away for you though and I’m worried it won’t impact me much. It’s worth a shot though! How long have you been on it?

It’s been cold and rainy here so even if I did like running outdoors, I wouldn’t do it in this weather (I’m such a pansy lol). So I just have to motivate myself to do my yoga! 

Good luck with everything!"
PCOS,flnex3n,t1_flnd3re,1585317073.0,"Girl I totally agree. Life without treats is pointless. I still indulge every now and then because we would go mad if we had to stay so strict.

I’m a little chubby too, and have always suffered from acne I feel like. So I feel you there. I’m still trying to lose weight despite my improved diet. I take berberine for managing my insulin resistance but I’m wondering if I should also take ovasitol. Also with the shutdowns here in the states my gym is closed and I’ve been struggling to exercise. I know exercise helps me a lot but it’s so much harder for me to self-motivate! Lol

It really is good you eat the vegetables despite not liking them. I’ve tried to find ways to eat them/sneak them into my diet and make them tasty but still not my favorites! Do you have any particular way you like to cook them/prepare them? 

I’m trying to get my boyfriend to see how much sugar he consumes and how much it could be affecting him. Pure sugar in cokes and candies and cookies, like he is fond of, is so bad for the brain and body. He just doesn’t want to change and it makes me sad. Cutting out added sugar (besides occasional indulgence) helped me mentally so much. I was such a sugar/carb fiend before. But it is hard to make the change so I don’t blame him for being hesitant. I would have married some
Mac and cheese in a heart beat back in the day! Lol"
PCOS,flnbalh,t1_flnatrt,1585314569.0,"It sounds like you’re very conscious of what you eat and avoiding sugar is the best thing you can do! So it’s good you’re so aware of it. Not many people are. Plus eating veggies and stuff. Can’t say I grew up liking veg so that’s great!

I understand your anger and frustration. I would feel the same if I had been on your diet. It sounds like your diet is fine then without keto! But you said you’re still having symptoms? That’s frustrating. Have you seen a big difference with Ovasitol at least? I think I saw a comment where you are taking that."
PCOS,fln9to5,t1_fllfihx,1585313452.0,Dang you really won the lottery on thyroid issues! Geez lol. Mind if I ask what your typical meals/snacks consist of? Just curious. I stay away from grains because of the carbs but always looking for more grain-free food and snack ideas
PCOS,fln9l0m,t3_fprs6y,1585313266.0,"I could never do keto myself so I understand that aspect. Every woman is going to be different to some degree. I know some have success just eating clean or doing a Mediterranean diet, but regardless of what works, doing nothing for your health and eating whatever you want will not help your PCOS symptoms. Although you did say you don’t eat much sugar, I also thought that about myself until I looked at labels. Then again you’re in Australia so perhaps they’re better at not adding sugar to everything!

I’m not advocating you do a diet that makes you miserable but to educate yourself on insulin resistance (if you haven’t already) and find the balanced meal plan that works for you. I’m guessing you tried keto because of certain symptoms you’re having.

Also it’s possible you were being too strict and not prepared enough to take on such a big lifestyle change. You shouldn’t have to feel so hungry and hate all the food you’re eating. I would give up too if I ate vegan cheese!  Lol it’s just not the same.

I tried whole 30 awhile ago without properly researching recipes and meal planning and ended up nearly fainting at work. I gave up a week in! Now that I’m doing low carb and have fully researched recipes and snacks, I don’t struggle with hunger or hating my meals. Well hunger a little bit at first because I was craving carbs but I upped my snacking on things like cheese sticks or almonds and just dealt with the extra calories until my body adjusted.

My point is not to tell you that you did it wrong or that you HAVE to go on a diet but that diet really is an effective way to treat your symptoms. It doesn’t mean you have to throw everything you loveaway, but it’s possible there is a way to more balance your current eating habits, without going full keto or anything. For me it started with just being mindful of what all had added sugar and what had refined carbs (trail mix, yogurt, my beloved cauliflower pizza). Things I didn’t expect to have excess sugar or to be high carb did. 

It’s good you ditched keto since it wasn’t working for you. No point in being miserable."
