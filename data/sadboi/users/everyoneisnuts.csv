So I kept drinking. It never got better. I may have had a fun time the first day after a relapse or something...maybe; but after that it was sure to be nothing but misery.

JoeRogan,fm55xbr,t1_fm514fk,1585766921.0,Absolutely. Sounds like what he is talking about is far from what he typically does and may offer some more insight into his own beliefs. He kind of tries to keep those somewhat close to the vest usually because he is more of a story teller and doesn’t want others to miss the actual story due to political beliefs and bias. I’m interested to see what he has to say. Sounds like he couldn’t silence himself anymore and had to speak about shit going on. Looking forward to checking it out.

But I don’t want people like you endangering my family and loved ones. It’s common sense; there are a ton of cases in NY. If people from an area that is infected to such a degree start coming and going from R.I. without any restrictions at all, it will spread here even more than it is. The only way to slow the spread is with restrictions like that. I mean, how do you have a problem with that? Read up on the constitution; there are clauses for absolute emergency states. I would say this qualifies. You should just let everyone quarantine at you house. Maybe start an Underground Railroad to R.I. with all of the oppressed people from NY who want to come to R.I. for some reason. This is the right move. I’m guessing you don’t have any family or children here. If you do, you are not a good protector of them.
