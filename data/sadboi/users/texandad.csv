bipolar,f8nvc9a,t3_e0s3le,1574653904.0,"Get him a hotel room or Airbnb w calm environment.  Encourage anti-inflammatory diet and excersize and sunlight.  Get him a loving therapist, not a pill pushing psych doc.  Do not involuntarily commit him to an oppressive mental health hospital.  He must recover and calm down from mania willfully or there will be consequences for you.  Maybe order some lithium Orotate from Amazon for him to take small doses of.  Also CBD oil (no thc) can help him chill out."
bipolar,f8nu7zs,t3_e0zvjd,1574653066.0,"I’m bp 1 and been off Lithium for ~ 14 of past 15 yrs.  Now 43 yrs old.  Was previously on lithium carbonate from age 18-28, then had the same concerns about my kidneys.  So I got off lithium around age 30.

Now, CBD oil (no thc) and a high fat smoothie in morning are my lithium substitutes.  And yoga.  Very thankful to be off Lithium."

I’m celebrating 19 yrs of marriage, close friendship, and lots of continued great sex with my wife who I reminded of our Holy Union during our unhappy crisis.  We both have a higher purpose for our marriage that involves God and our children.  Emotional abuse?  I find this comment a very weak exaggeration of the legit metoo movement.  Comments like this dilute and invalidate legitimate abuse."
Marriage,f55iuhv,t1_f54ugf6,1572008269.0,"Appreciate your response.  Yes it’s a sin.  Sins are forgiven.  I believe a repentant man deserves a 2nd chance to stay married.  I would offer that scripture offers much more about forgiveness than annulment.  I looked into it and do not see any scripture support that a Holy Union is annulled upon infidelity.  Severely damaged, yes.  But not annulled."

Marriage,f4k3og3,t1_f4k28so,1571634224.0,Never said it was not.  The real “fight” for marriage comes in couple therapy and softening of hearts.  Therapy can help to heal a marriage.

Marriage,f4jg0d4,t3_dkq6fr,1571618877.0,"Encouraging you both to get into counseling together soon.  If you are Christian, you did not just make a deal w her, but one w God also.  Let her know this.  Have your Christian friend let her know this.  This understanding of a Holy union can help to save your marriage.   Best wishes to you friend.  I endured a very difficult time w my wife, went to 2 solid months of 15 sessions counseling.  And it worked.  Our marriage and finances have been ridiculously blessed for honoring our Holy Union.  We have 3 kids also.  It is not easy work, but will be very sweet in the end for you.  Believe."
Marriage,f4iywda,t1_f4ir1i6,1571610956.0,What a loser commentary!  Fight for her.  Come 90% of the way if you want to save your marriage.  Soften your heart.  Marriage is worth it.  Nothing’s over if you soften your heart and swallow all pride.

Thanks in large part to Vital Mind Reset and dr Kelly Brogan.  Her anti inflammatory diet allowed me to get of meds completely.  I’m 43 yrs old bp 1 w 3 episodes and 2 hospitalizations in 28 yrs of diagnosis.  With discipline, diet, lifestyle...you can get off meds and heal.

Sweet potatoes and kB smoothie are my new lithium.

Dairy is inflammatory.  Avoid it and your moods will improve."

news,epueqzo,t3_bvdgqn,1559508546.0,"Appreciate the response friend.  I did not know about that group of people trying to quit weed.  Glad that that resource is out there for people who recognize their addiction or simply just want to stop a nasty habit.  

I could be wrong, but I imagine the disapproval comes from people hooked on weed.  Weed can often become their passion and bff.  I’d argue weed has an insidiously strong power to cloud one’s spirit and receptiveness to wise counsel.  Prove me wrong!  Change my mind!  :)"
news,epqzp3l,t3_bvdgqn,1559415502.0,"I’ll watch it.  Sure.  Im open to low or no THC CBD oil for medical reasons or sleep aid or similar, but think it should not be legal recreationally.   I’ve seen it mess up family members lives in a similar way alcohol does.

I also think it’s a lot better than prescription medication.  Prescription meds (Antidepressants, Benzos in particular) to me are more detrimental, insidious, dependency forming."
news,epqwfzo,t1_epq7qin,1559413671.0,"What’s it like?  I feel very healthy.  My kids are healthy.  My wife healthy.   None of us smoke weed.  We believe that keeping substances like weed out of our lives is a positive thing.  We have less problems as a result.  

Weed is particularly problematic for addictive personalities or mental illness sufferers.  Weed often increases anxiety thereby increasing depression.  Indeed, it messes up our nervous system.  

I look at my other family member who smokes daily.  He’s very unhealthy looking compared to before he started smoking.  Overweight, divorced.  And he smells bad."
news,epq2f6w,t3_bvdgqn,1559397857.0,"Appreciate you mentioning those other addictive things.  I’d argue, behind porn, marijuana is the most habit forming and destructive to your central nervous system of all you mention.  It has a place in medicine, but not recreation.  And it smells terrible.  Yuck."

news,eppx7n3,t3_bvdgqn,1559394211.0,"I’ve never smoked marijuana and personally believe it’s a dangerous, habit forming drug that can mess up your life.  But I recognize the value of legalization.  Lots of violent crime associated w illegal marijuana trade— Killing of legal pot growers in California to bring to marijuana to Chicago.  This recent legalization should reduce crime."
