NorthCarolina,fqgu9cw,t1_fqgl7z1,1589357335.0,"MeetMe is possibly worse than Whisper. Look, I know it can be really draining to join apps that advertise friendships or chat but they're also pretty much only for hookups. MeetMe in particular is pretty heavily used for sex work.

MeetUp might be a better solution when the restrictions ease up. You can find people into the same hobbies or interests, etc. I've never had any bad experiences with people on there.

Finding local groups on FB for things that interest you isn't a bad idea either. The reality of being a woman online is that you're going to get creeps. That's anywhere, not just NC.

I have a feeling a lot of the reasons you're not making friends is some personal shit (seriously 3 people killed your animals? ok) so until you work out that mess, good luck."

Obesity can greatly increase the risk you *die* from it though. Diabetes, high blood pressure, respiratory problems, etc. are all common with obesity. And I'm saying this as a freaking diabetic. I'm not going to get COVID19 just because I'm diabetic and chunky. But could it be a lot worse for me if I do? Yes.

You're getting offended cause someone said fat."

Was pulled in Hickory about a week ago over it. Officer was nice about it and just asked if I knew that was something I could still get done with the stay-at-home order.

That said, every shop I've called & been to has been pretty awesome about social distancing, sanitizing, and limiting any customer contact."

I would definitely give it a try (maybe not that specifically, but something other than Sprintec.) When mine was at its worst, I also had a colposcopy and had doctors all up in my bits and there wasn't anything going on.

Sprintec really just ruined my damn life for a while. I was literally crying every time I went to the bathroom because there was ALWAYS blood and it was so depressing and infuriating until my doctor pointed out that extended periods were a common side effect. I was also skipping placebos with Sprintec hoping it would stop and it didn't.

For real. Try something else if you can. I put up with it for far too long and it's one of the most common complaints against Sprintec."
