TalkTherapy,fr5ffyz,t1_fr5dtwq,1589907684.0,"That makes a lot of sense, and honestly that’s a really helpful perspective. I hadn’t thought of it that way, like “taking a loan out” on trust. I also trend disorganized in my attachment so it feels like trying to time when it’s the right time to take a bit of a leap of faith. I’ve realized I also tend to get caught up in my own inner perfectionist thinking that everything has to be “in order” and that my therapist needs to know “all the things” before we dig into something like EMDR. I’m trying to learn to start letting that idea go a bit. Just trusting the process would be a good place to start, I suppose. Thank you for replying, and I wish you all the best in your healing journey :)"
TalkTherapy,fr5c8hf,t1_fr4l8qt,1589906159.0,"How important do you think strong trust is with your therapist is before delving into EMDR? I want to go that route, but at the same time, it scares me to get started."

TalkTherapy,fr0z0l7,t3_glv1bq,1589809944.0,"I feel the same, and it’s tough because I was beginning trauma therapy and had only seen my therapist twice in person before everything shut down. So we have been trying to build a brand new relationship remotely, on top of trying to begin addressing some deep topics. We switched from video to phone sessions recently, which has personally helped me, but it does feel a bit more isolated not being able to co-regulate together in the same room. There is so much in the nonverbal and presence of another human being that gets lost in teletherapy. Be gentle with yourself. This is hard work in a hard time. Best of luck to you."
raisedbynarcissists,fr0m1f7,t3_glvpgr,1589800300.0,"I remember telling my therapist the list of all the things I wanted for my kids, if I decide to have them. And she looked up and smiled and just said, “all the things you never had.” And I remember pausing on that moment and how it almost made me cry. We are going to break the cycle. I wish that we didn’t have to think in this way, but I’m also so proud of everyone for being able to see that we can be better than what we knew and that our past does not have to dictate who we are. Much love 💙"

CPTSD,fohh03j,t3_g7772r,1587765847.0,"The first therapist I saw was an ACT therapist. Personally, I did like the overall direction ACT aims to go, and the focus is not on changing thoughts, but instead, learning to accept them, while identifying and moving towards your own personal values. 
However, I would say that if you need to do trauma-processing, I would recommend finding a trauma therapist or looking into doing EMDR in conjunction with ACT. Hope this helps a bit."
