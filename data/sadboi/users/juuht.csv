insaneparents,f2y9t52,t3_d3r4g7,1570487934.0,"some people think i'm just being dramatic when i say that my father was abusive to me and my mother just because he didn't beat us. well, i'd sure rather that he did. the emotional and psychological trauma is way worse.

i don't even know how to begin, maybe my depression is a good start point. i always had depressive tendencies but it got way worse 2 years ago and only got treatment last year. he found out that i was sick and had suicidal thoughts when we went to a psychiatrist, that said i needed medications to stop me from harming myself. his first reaction was ""i don't agree with giving antidepressants to a teen"" and the doctor had to convince him to do it. you may think it's okay not to like the idea of giving such medicines to a 14-year-old but keep in mind that my life was at risk. the psychiatrist suggested that we went to a family therapy after he found out that my father is the main reason i'm depressed and suffer from generalized and social anxiety and almost developed ocd. he denied it and said he would never do it. luckily me and my mom asked him to leave us shortly after.

when he was home, my grades were never enough, even when i got 100% on tests, specially if it was an essay (he thought i would be a good writer). we had to be extra careful not to piss him off, otherwise he'd start screaming and sometimes threw glasses and jars on the wall and once my mom had to clean the floor after he broke a jar with coffee powder inside. he wanted me to be a perfect daughter and that made me almost develop ocd, i started to want everything to be perfect too. he told me my favorite songs were trash, the games and movies i liked were stupid and etc. basically told me my opinions didn't matter ever since i was a little child and that's why i got social anxiety. even my fear of heights is because of him: when i was playing in a wooden bridge at the park, he would shake it up and ignore me as i cried and begged him to stop.

on top of that, my brother's girlfriend (lawyer) found out that he owns an apartment and invested a lot of money on some company. we've always paid rent and lived on a budget, what makes us think that basically he's rich and never told us about it. he even lied about still being married to my stepbrother's mother just so he didn't have to marry my mother. now he acts all sweet when texting me but i don't fall for that. i wanted to love my father but i can't forgive him if he doesn't even admit he's wrong (i asked him to do it so i could heal but he said that ""regret doesn't fix anything""). my stepbrother (i actually consider him a brother) loves him and says our father was harsher on him but that's just because he had a bad childhood. i dare to say he only thinks so because he only had to deal with him until he was 7 (i turned 15 last week).

sorry for the long post and/or if i wrote something wrong, english's not my mother tongue."
AmItheAsshole,f1rspzg,t1_f1rp3uc,1569719691.0,"i think i'm actually a pretty good kid. don't drink, don't do drugs, get good grades, don't go out late at night, have good friends... it's just that only ""good"" was never enough for him, he wanted perfect.

edit: and the things he used to throw were glasses and jars. one time my mom had to spend quite a time cleaning the floor after he broke a jar with some seeds inside, don't remember exactly what it was."
AmItheAsshole,f1rlti6,t1_f1rgscc,1569717200.0,"sorry, i didn't want to make it a long post but you have a point.

for example, he thought i could be a good writer so he used to read all of my essays and anything less than 100% was trash. sometimes, he would even say that if he was my teacher, he wouldn't have given me more than 90%. he was never happy unless he saw me studying. (that's why i almost got ocd and am still extremely perfectionist.)

when i was listening to my favourite songs, he would tell me they're all terrible. when i was playing a game or watching a movie/show, he would say it was stupid and those kinds of things. i started keeping all my opinions, thoughts, and everything i had to say, to myself, which lead me to social and general anxiety and then depression.
 
although he used to scream and throw things on the walls and floor, he never laid a finger in me or my mother, but his words were as sharp as knives.

what makes me feel guilty is that my brother went through the same (for less time - our father and his mother divorced when he was 7. i'll be 15 next week.) and still loves him. my brother says that our father made mistakes as a parent but he just wanted us to be successful and he acts this way because that's all he knew as a kid. i saw a picture they posted together on father's day and it almost made me cry. i wanted to be able to see his face and don't remember how he made me feel."
