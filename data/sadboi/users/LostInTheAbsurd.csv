abortion,fnho3mt,t3_g1kaph,1586965893.0,"I feel your struggle. I am going through the same thing right now. I am 8 weeks and I am running out of time if I want to get a medication abortion. I'm really struggling with the decision, because I do want this baby. I think about how cute itll be, and me and my boyfriend already picked out names. He keeps telling me not to worry about money, and we already have a lot of baby stuff because he has an 9 month old. I've been taking care of his son since he was 4 months old, so I kind of know what I would be getting myself into, though I have never experienced a new born. My biggest concerns are that I'm not working right now, and I have some medical issues that make working very hard for me. And it would be the same situation struggling with my medical issues and taking care of a baby. Well 2 babies. This has definitely been the hardest decision I've ever had to make in my life, and I really can't decide what I should do. I know that in a perfect world, where my health was better I wouldn't think twice about having this baby. But my conditions are not ones that will ever go away, and I will still have them whether I have this baby now, or years down the line. And worse yet, it is genetic and has a good chance of being passed on to my baby as well. My boyfriend is super supportive with whatever decision I make, but he thinks that if I want it I should have it and it's that simple. God I wish it were that simple.."
ehlersdanlos,f57u702,t3_dn2r7u,1572043388.0,"I cant say anything other than my own experience, but I've never had horrible periods. They have always been light and not very painful.  In  july I got an IUD put in just for the convenience. I wanted the implant but my insurance wouldn't cover it. So I got the IUD. After I got it I was in constant pain, especially with sex, it would feel like I was being stabbed inside and hurt for days afterwards. Also my cramping was way worse. I didn't really have a period after I got it put in, but I was spotting and cramping pretty much the entire time I had it in. Also I have never had bad acne, but it gave me horrendous acne. 

I've had it out for about a month now and i feel sooo much better. And my acne has cleared up, though I still have some scarring but its starting to fade. All I can say is for me it was horribly painful and I never stopped spotting. I'm so glad I got that thing out of my body. That's just my experience, but you can always try it. As far as I know, it didn't do any damage,  it just hurt like hell. And the whole time I kept going to my doctor trying to figure out why I was in so much pain, and they kept telling me it wasn't the IUD and not to take it out. I finally told them to just take it out and I feel so much better its insane."
ehlersdanlos,eyouvc8,t1_eyi3dwq,1567283728.0,I live in the USA too. And I just dont know about grants and financial aid and stuff. It seems like a huge commitment for something that I'm not even sure I'm physically or mentally capable of doing. And I have yet to find a doctor that cares or is supportive enough to help me with anything. I havent even gotten an official diagnosis. Just JHS. I'm not sure why but they wont diagnose me with HEDS even though I fit all the criteria.
ehlersdanlos,eyjc2ot,t1_ey9ycjk,1567116347.0,"Also I would love to have disabled friends who understand. I guess technically I have one, we used to work together but I transferred to a store closer to where I work so we dont see each other much anymore. We talk on Facebook but she's not much of a talker except in person lol. 

I can't even find normal friends much less anyone disabled that would understand."
ehlersdanlos,eyi3a2f,t1_ey9ycjk,1567096963.0,"I get what you were saying and I had gotten to a point where I was accepting that I'll always have limits, and bad days, and there are just things I can't do. But then my boyfriend made me want to do more and get better. And for a while I was doing really well. I had been doing physical therapy, I was working, i was walking more. I felt almost as though there wasn't anything wrong with me at all. We were doing things together that I never thought I'd be able to do. But I should have known it wouldn't work out because everytime I was in pain and not feeling good he didn't want to deal with it. He didn't believe any of it was real, and as soon as he realized it was real and I'll always have problems, he dipped. It just sucks you know. Not everyone is perfect. He's a lot of issues too. He had never been in a long term relationship because he got hurt too many times and it fucked him up to the point where no one would stay with him because of his issues. But I understand all his issues and I accepted them and loved him even more for it. Because we were the same in that sense. I always accepted his flaws because I understood and saw them as a reflection of mine. But he could never truly accept mine. I'm pretty sure he just struggles with empathy. And there were times where he was really understanding and empathetic. But it never lasted. He wont allow himself to care about anyone else because he doesn't want to get hurt. And I was getting him to open up his heart, and showing him that I wasn't going to hurt him and I wasn't going to leave him. But literally over night he decided that he didn't want what we had anymore. He didn't want to deal with me, and doesn't want to worry about anyone but himself. He's completely shut me out. He says he still loves me but he needs time to focus on himself. Which I understand. It just hurts because I gave him my heart, even though I knew he would break it. He made so many promises, and I knew better than to believe him, but I did because I wanted so badly for it to be true."
ehlersdanlos,eyi0hyt,t1_eyfpvfs,1567095655.0,"I have a lot of hobbies. Drawing, painting, knitting, playing guitar. Sometimes it helps as a distraction but that's all it is. There isn't a single thing that makes me happy. And I've tried therapy. I've had countless therapists and none of them ever helped, most just made me feel worse. I've been on so many antidepressants I've lost count. None of them helped. There is nothing that has helped me except my boyfriend. And now he doesn't want me anymore. 

I've been thinking about going back to school and getting an apartment so I can get away from my mom who also just makes me feel worse. But I'm afraid that going to school will be too much for me mentally and physically.  It was the first time, why would this time be any different? And not to mention the financial stress. I already am struggling to barely work. I make almost nothing, definitely not enough to pay rent anywhere.

 I'm thinking maybe doing something with my life will make me feel better, but I doubt it seeing as I've been depressed and suicidal my entire life and nothing has changed that. Then add all the medical issues on top of the mental illness and shitty life. I'm tired of trying to hold on. I'm tired of trying to fight this depression, and fight my body with all of these diseases. Why should I fight when I dont want to anymore, and it doesn't even make a difference?"
ehlersdanlos,ey96sjw,t1_ey7xi8e,1566936516.0,"Exactly. I completely understand it. That's why before I met him I swore to myself that I was never going to try to have friends or a partner ever again. I didn't want to be hurt anymore. But I couldn't resist him. And I made sure he knew from the very start how bad things can get for me. He just never believed me, and for most of our relationship I did do a lot better. I had been feeling the best I'd felt in years. He didn't see it. Even when I hurt myself and my knees get all fucked up, or when I was up all night crying because of how much my back hurt, he didn't want to acknowledge my limitations. He was in denial,  and he even admitted it. He finally realized that I'm not going to get better, and I can't just keep pushing. It's hard not to be angry and sad. I knew better. But I believed all the things he said. I know I need to let go, and I know there are billions of other people out there, but I don't want to go through this ever again. And I don't want anyone else. I just want him to accept me, and stay with me.

Before I met him I was literally planning my suicide. I had given up on life for a long time, and I didn't think I could ever feel good again or want to live. He made me want to live. He is the only thing that has made me feel happiness in years. He helped me in so many ways, and him pushing me has helped me do so much instead of laying around and making excuses. And now that I've felt happy and so much love, the thought of living without him is just so much worse. I wish I had just killed myself like i planned on in the first place. The only thing keeping me here is the last little bit of hope that i can get better enough to function, so that he will stay with me."
BPD,ey94pgl,t3_cw4xqw,1566935188.0,Omg yes. All the time.
ehlersdanlos,ey7wkcb,t1_ey7w49n,1566903715.0,"He is only thinking of himself. And yeah he really doesn't get it. Idk what to do. I love him so much and I don't want him to leave me, but I also understand that I am a burden. I just wish I was better. 

How do you get by not being able to work?"
ehlersdanlos,exl7qv6,t3_cth67i,1566407662.0,"I feel this so much. The only difference is that I have a boyfriend, and my mom. I'm stuck between feeling completely alone, and wanting to be alone because everyone around me just makes me feel worse. I feel so trapped. I constantly feel like I can't breathe and I'm suffocating. I've tried everything. I've tried therapy, I've tried just about every antidepressant out there, nothing helps. Yesterday my anxiety was so bad and I was so overwhelmed I almost decided to go to the hospital so if nothing else they could sedate me. But I've been hospitalized so many times and they never helped me either. I would just be even more trapped.

I hate this fucking body, and I can't escape it. I try so hard to keep going. I'm working 2 jobs just trying to get a little bit of money, but everytime I work, my knees get fucked up, and then I have to call off for a few days. It's too much for me. I know I need to quit, because i can't handle the stress and the pain that working is causing me, but I'm so tired of being useless and a disappointment to everyone around me. I'm trying to get on disability, but I just started the process and it will take a while. That is if I ever get it at all which I probably wont. I can't even get a doctor to actually diagnose me with EDS. I got diagnosed with JHS, and the doctor literally told me that there would be no point in trying to diagnose me with EDS because it wouldn't change anything. 

I'm sorry. I didn't mean to come on here and rant about myself. I always do that on here. It's just the only place I know where people understand. I wish I could help, instead of just complaining. But all I can do is let you know that I understand and you aren't alone in your pain. If you can, try to find a friend. I don't really have friends, but I have my boyfriend, and idk what I would do without him. He is the only thing that pulls me out of my own pain and wallowing. Sometimes it's hard because he doesn't understand what I'm going through, but he keeps me from losing my mind completely, even if it's just laughing about stupid shit. A good companion does more than any drug or therapy. And if you need someone to talk to you can talk to me."
BPD,ew4m955,t3_cml7m2,1565113616.0,"All the time. I don't understand why other people are so cold and unkind. How most people can just hurt and use other people like it's nothing, and not even feel guilt. And everytime I'm around other people I just feel so misplaced, like I don't belong. I think that's why I've always liked being around animals so much. It doesn't feel that way with them."

But before that, I always got stuff like ""well you aren't going out and having reckless sex or going on spending sprees, ect., so I don't think you have it"".

My psychiatrist was the only one that didn't need much convincing. He was already about to diagnose me with it when I brought it up."

BPD,eszfo5s,t1_esz45b0,1562361098.0,"thank you. ive talked to him about it a little bit, and he keeps reassuring me that he will be ok. i worry about it because his best friend is a terrible influence, and everytime he is around his friend he gets really fucked up and starts doing stupid shit. his friend will take handfuls of pills at a time. i dont know how he hasnt died yet. and he thinks just because he has taken tons of pills and been ""fine"", that nothing will happen and my bf will be fine too. ive realized that there is a huge unspoken conflict between me and this friend.

the friend already dislikes me because he doesnt trust me. he thinks im going to say something i shouldnt, or snitch on him. idk why, i couldn’t care less about his drugs. also i think he is jealous. hes like a jealous girlfriend who wants my boyfriend all to himself. he doesnt like that my boyfriend spends time with me and not with him. and i dont like how reckless he is, and how fucked up they both get. everything goes to shit when they are together. and hes been trying to turn my boyfriend against me the entire time we have been together.

i dont know what to do about this friend. im not going to make him choose between me and his friend, but something has to change before our lives get torn apart."
BPD,esyvz22,t3_c9andn,1562350655.0,"I'm sorry. I wonder if he even realized his problem was as bad as it was. This is what I worry about with my boyfriend. He tries to hide all his feelings, and struggles, and drinking and drug use from me. Well he doesn't exactly hide it from me, but he won't tell me the extent of it, and up until weds I thought he had everything under control because he is very experienced with drugs, and I know close to nothing about them.

I think he thinks he is protecting me by not telling me what is going on when I'm not around, but that just makes me worry more because I'm not there to look out for him and make sure he is alright."
BPD,esyp0b2,t3_c9andn,1562346842.0,"This hit me really hard because just Thursday something similar happened. I called my boyfriend and he said he was just about to get off work and would call me after a shower. I kept waiting but he didn't call me back. I finally called him again and he was slurring really bad and not making sense. He told me he took Xanax, and wanted me to come over to his friends place where he was at. I was really pissed, but I rushed over to make sure he was ok. When I got there both him and his friend had nodded off, and I kept trying to get him up but he was unresponsive. He was barely breathing, and his pulse was very weak. It really freaked me out because he has always had the strongest heart beat I've ever heard/felt. I was terrified. I laid with him for almost 3 hrs making sure that he didn't stop breathing. And eventually I was able to force him awake. 

I kept trying to tell him how bad it was, and how lucky he was, and he just wouldn't get it. He kept saying that he didn't take that much, and he was fine. The rest of the day, he was zonning out, and confused, and I kept having to remind him over and over everything that happened. 

He was better yesterday, and basically spent the whole day sleeping it off. I showed him the videos I took of him nodded off, and he said ""wow, it doesn't look like I'm even breathing"", and I was like FINALLY, now you fucking believe me that it was bad. 

But after that I'm still worried. I still don't think he realizes how close to death he was. He's kind of just shrugging it off, and I don't know how to get through to him that he needs to be more careful, and he legitimately almost OD'd and died."
BPD,essaxpf,t3_c8zf9y,1562248505.0,"I feel like this all the time. I don't enjoy talking to or being around people I don't connect with, and like you said it just feels shallow and empty. Every time I'm with people I feel so alone. And I feel you about your FP. He was the only one that I really had a connection with, and made me not feel alone. And idk, because it's not like he doesn't feel the same about me, he does, it's just lately he is always super high or faded and it's just been worse and worse. Either he is coming down from the drugs and is mean to me, or completely zoned out and has no idea what is going on or what he has done to me.

At first he made me the happiest I'd ever been in my life. He was helping me so much with everything in my life. But it feels like now he is just tearing my life apart again. And it's so much worse than it was before, because it's like I got a glimpse of heaven, and now I'm just thrown back into hell. 

I know I should leave him, because he won't stop. He's been too fucked up to even care that he is hurting me. Every time I try to confront him about how badly he's been treating me, he doesn't understand why I'm upset because he doesn't actually remember anything. But I love him so much, and after having such a strong connection and making life worth living for me, I can't go back to being alone. I'd rather just die. Life is pointless without him."
BPD,esi8aja,t3_c7ruk4,1562008720.0,"I do that sometimes. Usually when I'm depressed but feeling numb. But lately I've been feeling a lot more, and when I cry I flat out sob and wail until I can't anymore and fall asleep from exhaustion. It feels like my soul is on fire.

BPD,esh0c1y,t1_esgyff3,1561976574.0,"Idk. I'm starting to think he has BPD too. One min we are deeply in love and imagining our future together, and the next min he is thinking about screwing other girls and breaking up with me. I know he loves me, but he's really unstable too. I'll say something, and he will take it the wrong way and get mad at me and say stuff that he knows will hurt me. I know it's just his defense, because he is scared that I'm going to hurt him, and I get that, and I'm sympathetic because I'm the same. Except just a different response to the fear. I get scared and try to run away before I get hurt, and he gets scared and gets angry and then does hurtful things. But it's getting worse the more we love eachother because the more love, the worse the pain will be. I just can't handle it anymore. 

They say us BPD people are like emotional burn victims. And I feel like he keeps wrapping up my wounds with bandages, and then when I start to feel like I'll be ok, he sets all the bandages on fire."

ehlersdanlos,epivaqz,t1_epit0lj,1559243627.0,"See one of the good things that I really miss about my ex was that he was there with me before I got really sick, and stayed with me even though I was sick. We were only together for about a year and a half before I got sick, and he stayed with me 9 and a half years. He was always really understanding of my pain and limitations. But I broke up with him for other reasons. I think that was one of the main reasons I stayed with him so long. I never thought anyone else would put up with it and tolerate me and my life. It's so hard to be around people that dont understand. So far it has been alright with my new boyfriend but everytime he says something that makes me feel invalidated I get this panic in my mind like ""I knew this was a mistake"" and I want to run away before he gets the chance to break my heart. Or I just completely shut down. I've been disappointed and invalidated and crushed by so many doctors and people in my life who treat me like I'm exaggerating or I should just get over it. Instead of trying to make them understand I just instinctively  shut down and give up all hope of ever being understood. Even though he makes me happier than I've ever been in my life, I'm so scared of what will happen when he realizes no amount of hoping or positive attitude is going to magically make me better. Sometimes I feel like hes trying to fix me, and when he realizes it's not working he will give up on me, and find someone happier and more positive and energetic."

I've avoided people for so long, since I'm pain got so bad that it was all I could think about, and talk about but no one could understand or wanted to hear about it. And i dont blame them. So i just went away from the world. And now i have a new boyfriend (even though I swore I'd never date again), and hes super awesome and amazing and makes me feel great about life and not want to die. But he is always trying to push me to do things, go out and be social, work more, excercise more. I know he just wants me to be happy and all that stuff is good, but he just doesn't understand how stressful it is for me, or how much pain I'm in, or what a delicate balance it is to keep me somewhat not in pain, or how easily I get hurt.

He will jokingly make comments like ""oh, you are just a hypochondriac"", or ""stop acting like a 60 year old"" when I complain about how bad my back hurts from sitting in an uncomfortable chair for 2 hrs. He was says he believes me when I talk about pain, but he acts like he doesn't believe me. Maybe it's just because normal, healthy (very healthy, strong, excercises all the time, does lots of hard manual labor all day, etc) person just can't comprehend how much pain sitting uncomfortably can cause me. Hes always super positive and encouraging and tells me I'm strong, and that I can do more than I think I can.

Maybe it's like his testosterone or something, but I've never experienced it with anyone else. But I've also never met someone as caring and nurturing as him. And I think maybe that has something to do with it. Like with my ex, anytime I thought about the possibility of us having kids, it was like ""oh, dear god I could not have kids with him. That would be awful"". But with him, it's like my brain just goes ""I WANT TO HAVE YOUR BABIES!"". Lol either way, it's too soon for that. Like I said, it's a new relationship. But I feel like we need to at least be on the same page. Cuz it would be better to end it now, than 5 years down the line. 

Its kinda like where I'm at right now is I dont want kids, but if I did want kids I would want them with him."
childfree,ep5qo6w,t1_ep5p1nt,1559059700.0,"I know. It just worries me cuz when I'm with him I start to think that I do want kids with him. It freaks me out because I know it's not a remotely good idea. Like I'm sure he'd be a great dad if he got his shit together. But with all my medical issues, and mental issues, it would take a miraculous act of God for me to actually be able to handle having kids.

The problem is that now I'm not so sure anymore. Like if it weren't for my medical issues, I probably would do it when we are more stable. But the medical issues aren't anything that will ever go away. And its genetic, so once again, there's the possibility that my kids could end up suffering like me."

Right now I think he's thinking about it because he loves his niece and she is super cute. And he's really good with her, and has fun playing with her, but he's also never experienced it full time. It's kind of like how some people love kids that aren't theirs. At the end of the day, you still get to go home and relax and not have to deal with it anymore lol. He thinks cuz he changed he diaper a few times when she was little, and sometimes watches her for a few hours he can handle it. But he is NOT ready for that. He is still very immature (which I don't have a problem with, actually I love it), and he likes to party all night, and not have responsibilites, so I have no idea how he got it in his head that having a kid anytime soon would be a good idea. 

Plus if we did end up having kids in the future, I'd be the one taking care of them while he's at work since I'm disabled."

My desire to never have kids never wavered up until this point. But now I'm starting to get these urges and its freaking me out, because I know I dont want kids. I dont know if it's the whole biological clock thing, or because I started dating this new guy and he is so amazing it just makes my ovaries go crazy. Like I'm hoping it's just all the love chemicals in my brain, since it is a new love and we are still in that ""crazy In love"" phase. But it never happened to me with any other guy.

All i know is it terrifies me. Because he wants kids, and with all the love and hormones, my lizard brain keeps trying to make me think that it's a good Idea. And i know it's not. It will never be a good idea. Even if I wanted a kid, I could not handle one. I have a boat load of medical issues, I'm in constant pain, and most of the time feel like a 70 year old woman. And then to top it off, my family has severe depression. I know its genetic, because it affects every single member of my family. Those genes are strong. Plus, both me and my boyfriend are bipolar, and have it in our families. I've always been a firm believer that if there is even a chance that my offspring would end up having to suffer even 1/10th of what I have, then I would not bring them into this world. Even if I wanted kids. And I KNOW beyond all doubt I dont want kids. It's just stupid hormones, and instincts but its driving me crazy! I want to get sterilized before I make a horrible mistake and get knocked up, but I know my boyfriend really wants kids. I'm not sure what to do about that situation either. I guess I should have ended things when he said he wanted kids, but I'm too deep in love now lol. And at first he said he was fine with not having kids, but now he says he knows for sure he wants kids. Honestly I just keep hoping that I'm just naturally barren, that way he can't blame me for being sterile."
