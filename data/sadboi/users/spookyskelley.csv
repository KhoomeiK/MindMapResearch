How long have you been playing: I was a player 4 years ago. I’ve been DMing for 2.5

What are you DMing now or what was the last thing you DMed: I’m DMing two campaigns and run one shots here and there, right now a role play heavy campaign based in Azeroth (World of Warcraft) and have a homebrew world I built around my players and what they wanted to play and have.

When was the last time you got to be a player: since my old DM canceled the campaign. It’s been about 2 years. 

What do you want to play as: anything. Literally whatever the party needs I will play

What modules are you interested in playing: I’m only familiar with 5e, any modules. I really love in depth backstories and role play.

If the answer to either of these was the wrong answer, it was time to intervene. If you’re not having periods, your caloric intake is too low. Back in the nomadic times of mankind, if the tribe couldn’t find enough food, your body wouldn’t allow you to have a baby because it would kill you both.
