SuicideWatch,fnuglw3,t3_g3qoac,1587261618.0,"I feel you, I'm 25 and feel the same exact way. The worst is the guilt I get of being so hateful and spiteful of others. I'm so god damn insecure about everything. I wish I could give you advice. I still have hope. It's not much and it seems to be fading everyday. Hopefully after this quarantine is over things will turn around. But I've been saying that for a while."
SuicideWatch,fnufy4h,t3_g3tuc3,1587261187.0,Have you talked to a therapist? Your family members may care deeply about you but they may not know how to handle what you're going through as many people don't. You should talked to a trained professional so you can work through what happened to you. I'm very sorry about what happened to you. Don't feel you are a burden and don't give up.
SuicideWatch,fnuf217,t3_g3t614,1587260601.0,"I'm in the same boat more or less, 25 m that wasted his coming of age years being terrified of social situations and constantly hiding away because of it. Now I feel like I missed a huge part of development that normal people go through. If you're relationship is good with your mother you should tell her, tell her you are having these issues and want to seek therapy to get better but don't have the money. She may help you. Therapy can help a lot, its not a fix all but it can help a lot."
SuicideWatch,fm2pip0,t3_fsmc3h,1585702452.0,You're doing a great job and we're all incredibly thankful for you to be brave enough to go through what you are going through. That being said look after yourself first. Don't feel bad or weak to be feeling like you are. You have an incredibly tough job that many could not imagine doing right now. Do what is best for you.
trapproduction,fl6y0w0,t1_fl6q1cs,1584887443.0,I really like the piano melodies and the synth you added in sounds good with it. All around solid beat but I would say maybe mix up the drum pattern more especially the high hats.
trapproduction,fl6xtte,t1_fl6h9xq,1584887218.0,"This is dope, I love the percussion pattern. My only critique would be the mixing sounds a little off. Like the main snare is too loud in relation to everything else and the bass could hit harder. My headphones are pretty flat though so it could be that."
