NoStupidQuestions,fqse39y,t3_gknsbx,1589604816.0,"I think it depends on how obese, I’ve heard that for some people who are pretty big but active, once they lose weight they have comparatively big calf muscles from hauling around all that extra weight. For someone so big that they can barely carry out activities of daily living, their muscles would atrophy from not moving around."

AmItheAsshole,fqcdvvp,t3_gi07h2,1589255830.0,"YTA. If you’re not established in an exclusive relationship, that’s fine to be seeing other people. However, it’s definitely rude the way that you state it. I don’t think most women would have a positive reaction to that. Also, if you’re sleeping with multiple women then hopefully you’re being upfront so that they are able to protect their sexual and emotional health."

AskWomen,fqblhfm,t1_fqa1p4o,1589239216.0,"Ugh ☠️ I was a hostess at this restaurant from the age of 16/17 i’ve been till I left for college at 18, and I had a boss that was like this too. He was also in his 30s. It started with small things, like making sexual jokes and “accidentally” brushing against my butt or chest. It escalated, and traumatized me. I didn’t realize until I got to college how fucked up what he did was I had a breakthrough after being raped in college at 19, and I completely fell apart when I realize how long I was taken advantage of for.  Still dealing with PTSD and guilt :/

Edit: Ew, just remembered something horrible about him that stuck in my mind. When I was 17, I was working with two other hostesses that were 15. I remember him coming up to us and asking “Are you girls virgins?” 🤮🤢"
AskWomen,fq6t5lv,t3_ggc6zm,1589137524.0,"I said that I understood, thanked him for our time together and wished him well. He wanted to be friends, but I knew I couldn’t handle that so I let him know that and then deleted him from social media."
AskWomen,fq6rfur,t3_ggfrt7,1589136859.0,"I ghosted my partners. Albeit, they were old creepy men taking advantage of a traumatized young teen, but I still feel horrible about ghosting. I hurt my parents. I lied, and cheated. I stole a Red Bull from the gas station once when I was 19 and I’m still harboring guilt over that lol. I treated a lot of people like crap, because of how I felt inside."
AskWomen,fq6qxv2,t3_gh2b7j,1589136655.0,"It’s so hard. I have been in quite a few toxic relationships, because I was toxic at that time in my life as well. I realized though time and therapy that I was choosing abusive people over and over because it felt comfortable, although at the end of the day it was just another form of self harm. My last relationship brought me so much pain I was reduced to “change or this is my life forever”. I had no choice but to leave him and I was at rock bottom. Funny thing is, as shitty as he was I still love him. I still think of him every day. I know it’ll get better over time, and every day I fight the urge to contact him with everything I have in me. I know I deserve better than being cheated on, sexually abused, lied to and objectified. I was never going to be happy with him. He was never going to change. At the end of the day, you have to prioritize your beautiful life and your interests. People do not change unless they want to, and it certainly won’t happen because you want them to. I also had to realize and accept things about myself. It’s okay for me not to like certain things in bed. It’s okay for me to change my mind. It’s okay to not want to participate in activities and spend time around people that make me uncomfortable. It’s okay to want to better myself and want better. Above all, it’s okay to walk away from situations and people that are not going to enrich your life. Even if you still love them. You have to choose YOU."

AskWomen,fpzzyph,t1_fpxznbi,1589026117.0,"Man, I didn’t even realize my last partner was doing this to me for a while. He would love bomb me, say all these nice things and how much he loved me and then like clockwork, every weekend he would ghost me for like two or three days. And then come back as if nothing happened. When I called him on it, he acted like I hadn’t even said anything. I wonder if that’s an abusive tactic too. Literally acting like I didn’t say anything at all when I brought up concerns, leaving me wondering if I was crazy or if I even had said anything at all. That left me doubting my sanity for a while."

Honestly, it is better to know before marriage and kids and all that. It’s such a hard conversation to have. I was miserable for four months, and I never once brought it up. Leaving was the best thing I did for both of us."

For a long time I just kept making the same bad decisions and I wasn’t able to see that I was contributing to my own unhappiness. I sought help for my mental health, I’ve been in therapy and on medications for quite awhile now and I’m not gonna lie it took a long time to find the right combination of meds and the right therapist. Most of all I started being honest with myself. I started treating myself and talking to myself like how I would a best friend. I’ve always been a really good friend to others, so I thought why not do that for myself? You are your own biggest investment. You can never walk away from yourself, so learning to love yourself is a daunting but very worthwhile investment! And remember, not every day is gonna be happy or easy and that’s ok :) it’s okay to feel whatever it is that you feel, it’s just important to not let those emotions control you."
