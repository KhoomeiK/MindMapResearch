That being said, if your doctor/therapist is dismissing you, have you thought about switching to a new doctor/therapist? The things you are experiencing are real, and if you want to seek help, it‚Äôs important to go to someone who will listen and takes you seriously. Don‚Äôt put that blame on yourself. ‚ù§Ô∏è"

AskReddit,fhjt0m6,t3_f3i60f,1581654744.0,"Where I work, there is a food truck that sells popcorn that will park around the corner. Occasionally I‚Äôll go down and get some for a mid-day snack. 

One day after I had purchased a bag, I was standing in the lobby of my office waiting for the elevator. A man who I have never met before, walks up to me, grabs the popcorn out of my hands, keeps walking, and then looks back at me laughing, like it‚Äôs a joke. I just looked confused because, again, I do not know this man, and he just proceeds to hand it back to me and say ‚ÄúJeez, I thought you would laugh‚Äù. He then proceeded to try to talk to me the entire time in the elevator, full of other people. 

I was so creeped out when I got back to my desk, I just threw the popcorn away."

Anxiety,f8sx4my,t3_e1yra7,1574791042.0,"Great job on confronting your fear! I know it can be super difficult. 

The odd sensations you are feeling is a manifestation of anxiety/panic that you are experiencing. It is completely normal and as someone who suffers from anxiety attacks, I‚Äôve found the best approach is to do something that might distract yourself for a while. 

For example, I‚Äôm a gamer and I play the game stardew valley when I need to take my mind off of things. Instead of focusing on my panic, I channel all my focus into something else (in this case, a game). 

Hope this helps ‚ò∫Ô∏è"

Anxiety,f16hkxt,t3_d81bhz,1569212820.0,"Hey! So I was a design student as well (I have since graduated and gotten a job as a UX designer), and I used to get this same type of fear. I would always worry my work wasn‚Äôt good enough, and compared myself to the rest of the class. I would put off starting projects because I was overwhelmed and didn‚Äôt even know how or where to start. 

The main thing I‚Äôve learned is: even if it feels impossible, just start. Start letting out any ideas you have, regardless if you think they are good or not. You can keep working and improving, but you have to start with something. I find working easier once I have some general ideas/concepts as a base. 

Another thing that really helped me is after I got those initial ideas out, share your designs with a friend/classmate (or even your teacher!). Getting and working with feedback is a huge part of the field, so this pays off in the long run anyway. I always found that talking about my design with someone helped me understand it better, and I was able to identify where I could improve. If you are very concerned about your grades, talk to the teacher and explain your concern and ask them for guidance/feedback on things you could do to improve. Asking a teacher this really shows you are dedicated and are willing to work to get better.

Hope this helps a little!"
