You should have a serious conversation with your wife.

Obviously he is upset that he missed his daughter‚Äôs birth and that sucks but you did not ask him to leave and it was beyond your control. It was all beyond your control. It must have been really difficult for you to experience that at that time. Your husband has to understand this. 

A small concession to your husband for missing the birth but ultimately it was his actions that leas to that and not yours. 

I hope you can both move past it and enjoy your daughter. It might take a while to rebuild trust with your MIL who put her feelings over yours when you were at your most vulnerable.

Don‚Äôt spend anything and don‚Äôt do things that will stress you out. Taking a time to try to be grateful for what you do have and slow down in the way you can. 

I don‚Äôt know where you are but most companies have a moral obligation to help you in times of hardship. Make your budget and send it to them with a letter askIng them to a) freeze your debt until you can make minimum payments b) freeze the taxes and interest until you can afford them or c) consider writing off some of your debt because of extreme hardship (medical bills, not being able to work or severe mental health problems). You can find draft letters online that will apply to where you are. Remember you only have to make minimum repayments so as not to affect your credit rating. You can prioritise which bills to pay first -rent/mortgage and utility bills. 

I hope you are able to have some hope for a happier time to come. Talk to your wife and decide together what you can and can‚Äôt handle. You probably can‚Äôt hide from Christmas but you can not spend money this Christmas. 

Also, check facebook groups and other sites like craigslist. There are good people out there having a clear out because they have way too much who would be happy for you to take something to wrap and put under the tree for your little one. That‚Äôs not charity. That‚Äôs society."

AmItheAsshole,f8ifzwr,t3_e0muyw,1574588325.0,"NTA. Protect your wife and baby. Maybe reframe it, as others have suggested and ask people to give advice only when you ask them. 

You seem like a good husband father as you have made efforts to understand your wife and your baby and their needs. 

Everyone else just has to fall in line or suffer the consequences."
mentalhealth,f83b9mf,t1_f82wyy6,1574208375.0,Our minds are fragile and strange and wonderous things. You are absolutely not a failure because you have depression. Everyone has their own things they have to deal with. That‚Äôs not to dismiss your suffering or say you‚Äôre not in need of help. It‚Äôs just to say that asking for help might be one of your successes.
