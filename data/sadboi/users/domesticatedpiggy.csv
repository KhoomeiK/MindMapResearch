TuxedoCats,fm76a7e,t1_fm5x7hi,1585814806.0,"Her ears go up and she listens intently, so I like to think she does too 😻 And I agree that she definitely has the makings of a therapist. Just being around her each day is so very soothing and therapeutic... 😻"

depression,fhxnq37,t1_fhwkwmz,1581958425.0,Same
antinatalism,fh5s2rx,t1_fh3rgbh,1581291782.0,"Well I mean, maybe it's not something to be ""proud of"", per say... 

But it's still the best course of action you can possibly take once you're already pregnant and the likelihood of another human being brought into this world to suffer is an ever-increasing probability. 

And I don't see why it's something that she should have to bear ""the shame of alone"" either. Whoever she fugged wouldn't have used protection either, she should be able to eject the fetus without complaints from others lol... That's the best case scenario anyway.

And even if you think she's being spoiled by her parents or something (which may be the case, who really knows), it's honestly only a good thing when parents openly support their children with such endeavors and don't go and force their own beliefs on them when a teen might not have a stable income of their own, and ruining their futures in the process.

Anyway, I'd say they do have plenty of reason to be overjoyed about it:

- getting a somewhat unpleasant procedure over and done with.

- evading the birth of more pointless offspring just in time and being able to live a regular teenage life free of any needless responsibilities forced on them at a young age

-ridding themself of any negative social stigma, especially if only the supportive family members really knew of the situation

-With how tight the restrictions can be (especially on minors, for whatever reason) on abortion, it could be considered quite the accomplishment to be able to get it done and like... 

-if she truly is underage, she's probably grateful to her parents for paying for it, if they did. And that they didn't try to prevent it which is also quite the common issue.

Anyway it's pretty obvious that this video's a joke and thus entirely staged. Just wanted to give my two cents."

TuxedoCats,fglpaxq,t1_fglmn4m,1580907141.0,Thank you! ☺️ She really is... 😻
TuxedoCats,fgldy25,t1_fgklwrb,1580892801.0,"Agreed 😻 She's already got her natural lovely suit, but now she's now also found an extra layer of purrito pizazz haha 😂"
TuxedoCats,fgldik8,t1_fgkynca,1580892190.0,"Yep! She went in between that blanket by herself, believe it or not. 😊 I literally turned around and she was there. 
She always finds new spots and especially seems to love blankets. 🤔

She also comes under the covers with me at night, has full conversations (or well, meows/chirps back at me pretty much everytime I say something to her), goes on all my guest's laps as well as mine... 🤔
She loves fetching things that I throw (I have a video posted of her fetching a marker jsyk). She can jump super high... Like, she's a pretty small cat, (adopted from the shelter as an adult, so I assume she was maybe malnourished before) but she's got really long and powerful legs and a playful attitude... And a long fluffy tail.

Gale is truly extraordinary, ngl. 😻"
TuxedoCats,ffs1q8w,t1_ffrvijr,1580170999.0,She certainly does! 😻 And is 😻

TuxedoCats,fbvp57j,t1_fbuqkrp,1577134038.0,True that. 😻😂 Much less vicious than that Lucifer cat in Cinderella though. 😊

TuxedoCats,fbvouns,t1_fbv2pek,1577133919.0,"She sure is.. 😻 Such a sweet, playful girl. 😻😂"
TuxedoCats,fbvof2i,t1_fbvk58e,1577133743.0,"She's about a year and a half. They told me a rough estimate at the shelter. 😻

Two years old is definitely young enough though, so it might be a while yet until your kitty calms down too. 😻😂 

My mom's cat/the family cat only mellowed out after he was like... 8-10 years old? He's lazy and only moves around for treats now. 
Doesn't give a fluff about toys. 😂
I mean he is pretty old now, at 12..."

TuxedoCats,faymj0u,t1_faxfu1z,1576403228.0,Very true. 😻 She's actually quite small for an adult cat body-length wise and weighs a little under average... But she's got very long legs.
TuxedoCats,f50rhfk,t1_f50oz17,1571931789.0,"Awwwww that's so sweet. ❤️😻 Your fluffy tuxedo boy seems absolutely adorable. ❤️ He must really be a bundle of energy too if he fetches for that long. :D 
Gale only likes to retrieve pens/pencils/markers. Not sure why. xD I found out when she pushed them onto the floor and went wild. But balls/other toys are just things she bats around, haha."
TuxedoCats,f50cre6,t1_f508351,1571925411.0,Gale and I thank you for the support. ❤️😻🙏 I'll post more pictures soon. 😊

TuxedoCats,f50ccjr,t3_dm7kj7,1571925223.0,"I did NOT expect this to blow up. :D I'm so glad you guys all love her too. 😊 Here's a bit of backstory cause' why not:

I moved to my own apartment as soon as I turned 18. I adopted this sweet kitty, Gale, about a month after that, and she's been my best friend ever since. ❤️ I love her so much! ❤️😻"
