Two things that helped a lot: daycare and a routine. She's calmed down a lot and while I still worry from time to time that she could be living a better life with someone else, I know without a doubt no one could love her more than I do. 

I hope it works out with your dog. Be patient with yourself and your boy. In my experience (I am no expert) dog training is 99% training yourself.
