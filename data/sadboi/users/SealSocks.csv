holdmyfeedingtube,fqo4u5l,t3_g4z2kz,1589507587.0,Can confirm that strapping your hands to a metal bar is how gymnasts are taught how to do giants. We used to wear these nasty felt mitts or wristbands with a slider on the bar. It was always scary when you’re in the middle of doing giants and you feel your hands starting to slip out of the straps haha

I’m going to miss out on my whole young life when I’m supposed to be having fun and doing shit to create memories because I’m depressed. I feel so much anger and sadness over the things I’ve missed out doing as a teenager, I won’t be able to survive it if the same happens as a young adult."

punk,foz8fbe,t1_foz7bc2,1588186411.0,">All of them, by voluntarily taking this career path, are supporting an institution which protects the cops who explicitly do bad shit. There is no reform movement within the law enforcement field. There are only ""Blue Lives Matter"" movements that assert their own importance and authority over people. Unless there is a strong will to correct this behavior and actually hold the murderers among them accountable, they are all complicit. Also doesn't help that almost half of them are domestic abusers.

This really helps me understand and it totally makes sense. Like I said, I already agreed that most cops are shit but now that I understand the underlying issue more, I can get behind the ACAB thing a lot more. Thanks for not bashing me and for being helpful"
punk,foz61hb,t1_foz4ylh,1588185281.0,"Fair point. But I have a question then, do all punks have to hate all cops? Do you not believe that any of them can have good intentions?
