We are generally equipped to deal with feelings, but many people don‚Äôt realize it. Things like anxiety, fear, anger, and sadness aren‚Äôt pleasant so we focus on the unpleasantness, and wish it would go away, and try to distract ourselves, and use things like alcohol to numb them. But if you sit down and do nothing.... nothing will happen. Your feelings won‚Äôt make you implode. If you feel a knot in your stomach or your hands sweat... just notice it and let it be for a while.

You spent barely any time with this person and you got super invested in working her into your serious relationship because she fit the mold you wanted, not because you both met her and all fell for each other and then decided from there a triad was right.

nonmonogamy,fj7coor,t3_fbtm3y,1583089713.0,"There‚Äôs a philosophical discussion on whether trying to keep feelings out of these arrangements is realistic or not but focusing on that will not give you the space to process and heal from this, which means it‚Äôs pointless right now. 

When a partner decides to do something with another person that is implicitly or explicitly not part of a relationship arrangement, and hides this from other partners because they KNOW it is likely to be voted down if asked about, that is a selfish action that does major damage to one‚Äôs sense of trust and safety in a relationship. Without this trust and safety, we cannot feel close to our partners, and our relationship will start to wither unless the breach is addressed and healed. I would suggest first having a conversation with your wife about this and how it is impacting you and your relationship. Tell her how you feel, what you need from her to feel heard and loved (maybe check out apology languages here to help you find the way.) Review relationship agreements and make ch ages for the future. Then you can discuss with the other couple. They will likely need their own time to work out whatever they are working out. Also, it‚Äôs very likely that due to this breach of trust, your wife‚Äôs relationship with Calvin is tainted, and even if you decide to allow solo play and emotional attachments in the future, it may be wise to agree on it pertaining to future partners rather than to this couple."

Also if you‚Äôve only been with your bf for a while, the first person you start being intimate with after will have a certain excitement around them that is more likely to make you attached. This will become less common the more you date/hook up, as only certain special people are likely to really hook you. 

As to what to do.... up to you. If it‚Äôs distracting, you can certainly be honest and break it off. You can try to navigate casual while managing your feelings. Or you could look into a more polyamory type relationship, or something in between, and discuss it with your bf and new guy. Lots of options."

Be picky. Focus on people in similar setups as you, who really seem neat. I‚Äôm in a large city with a huge ENM crowd.
