BPD,fcof75u,t3_ei3rkd,1577830773.0,Yes! I’m an ICU nurse and I come in with a smile on my face. My mind is constantly fighting itself when I’m by myself. My thoughts seep in and find a way disrupt my night. Its an silent uphill battle I deal with. I find a way to put suppress those thoughts when my patients are crumbling and about to die. It’s an out of body experience. I don’t feel like myself at work because it’s not the real me.
