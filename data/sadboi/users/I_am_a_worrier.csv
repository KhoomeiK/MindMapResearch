It could happen to anyone.

Most, when exposed to THC have a soothing and enjoyable experience.

Others are just substance sensitive and cannot enjoy THC anymore since when the same receptors are stimulated it makes them paranoid and anxious.

Especially modern weed that can reach THC levels as high as 30% which hasn't been studied long term and so far has negative results.

You can try 10-15% levels and cut down to once per use.

You can try switching to high CBD 10%+ to low THC < 1% which has been proven to have calming and relaxing effect. Hard to find though, since most prefer THC to kill off their brain cells.

Also, if you are generally in an anxious and bad headspace, high THC weed will only amplify this.

Anxiety,fo1vqo1,t3_g56rmr,1587442594.0,"It happens.

It's your body's reaction to THC.

For a good chunk of people THC in weed acts as relaxant by stimulating certain receptors, which also connected to anxiety and depression. Because these receptors stimulated, they feel at ease and enjoy their high.

For others like yourself and myself (I'm 30 and mostlikely double your weight) when the same receptors are stimulated by THC our anxiety levels spike causing us panic, elevate our heart rate, and create an 'out of body' or 'behind the glass' type of experience. Which is NOT enjoyable at all.

Is weed harmful? Short answer, no. You have nothing to worry about. There is still a lot of research to be done when it comes to psychological state and THC.

Most weed strands come with 12%-25% THC levels, the higher the worse it is on us.

However, high CBD levels of 12-25% create a positive experience without the psychological effects of THC.

Sadly, most people look for that 'couch-lock' experience which THC provides, while CBD mostly provides the body high without the 'brain-dead' experience. 

It is NOT recommended to smoke weed before 25, which is usually when your brain fully develops (that doesn't mean it stops changing).

For weed to have any long lasting negative effects, you'll have to be smoking it for years. Nay. Abuse it for years daily. 

Many never experience negative effects of THC or they could develop them 10 years later, like I have. 

Will you ever enjoy it again? CBD sure, THC most likely not.

Anxiety,fnpmg40,t3_g36unn,1587148079.0,"Ok, I'll explain how it works (14 years of relationship experience).

In many cases, when a partner breaks up with you, they had time to think over it. Maybe months.

Break ups are common.

Right now you feel broken, lost, she may have even told you ""Let's stay friends"". Never fall into that trap. It'll only make your healing process longer.

It's hard for both because you've created a routine that involves both of you. However, it's even harder for you. 

You feel lost because this routine doesn't exist anymore. You are trying to think of all the things you may have done wrong. I don't know your story, but I assume since you have some communication with her, it was a reasonable break up. You didn't do anything wrong. 

Think about it. Were you two really happy or just lived in a void of regular comfort? 

The butterflies that new relationships feel always fade after the first year. That's when the relationship start to change into something stronger due to hardships. 

Relationships are tough. It's hard work, commitment, communication, and compromise. 

Many assume that they will be madly in love, almost obsessively, at all stages of relationship. 

Yeah, that's not the case at all. 

Sometimes relationships argue, cry, shout, give space to cool down. It's all about how you communicate your concerns after. 

Many break ups are a blessing in diquise. You are a free person to love again, to experience wonders of intimacy again, and to make new choices.

The energy you have right now, channel into a hobby. 

Thanks to my first long-term break up, I've lost 60lb, tried jobs that I wanted, had fun during my single stage, and found an incredible woman who I hope to continue my life with. 

If anything, I'm greatful to my first ex for making that hard step. She had the strength that I didn't. 

We weren't happy. Our relationship was dead years prior. We just didn't know how to end it. 

Life's good. This is your blessing in diquise."
Anxiety,fnpgi01,t1_fnpg4dw,1587145098.0,"It's a process.

Condition yourself to think positive.

It'll take time."
Anxiety,fnpffux,t3_g2yzxi,1587144565.0,"I've worked in sales and huge part of it was calling 60-90 strangers a day. People who I have never met nor spoke to prior to calling. 

Initially it was tough.

I would sit there, staring at the phone, thinking of all mean and rude scenarios (that never, I mean, NEVER happened).


Reality of the fact, most feel some sort of phone anxiety. They'll feel exactly like yourself, paranoid to pick up the phone, thinking of the most ridiculous and idiotic scenarios. 


What ive leaned in my years of cold calling (I kept my data) :

* around 2-3% were rude - the rudest they'd say: ""Never call this number again"". Wow, so hurtful. MA HEART! 
*  15% would hand up - these people are too insecure to say they are not interested. No hard feelings. 
* 30% would honestly say yes/no - ""are you interested?"" and they'll give me their response. Made my job so much easier. If no, no hard feelings, move on onto next one. If yes, I'll book an appointment and usually sell them. 
* rest never picked up - who knew, right? 

You have to remember you are talking to regular people with feelings over the phone. 

You will NEVER forgive yourself if this is your grandparent's last day and you were too much of a coward to pick the phone. 

Imagine how fantastic you'd feel if YOUR niece, or sybling, or parent called you to congratulate you? 

Don't allow this irrational self-enduced anxiety to control you. Because this is what you are doing, allowing it to dictate your life. 

No. YOU are in control. 

Pick up the damn phone and say happy birthday to your grandma. 

""I was too scared to pick up the phone"" - is not an excuse. You are an adult. Act like one."

Anxiety thrives in isolation and fear of unknown.

Once this is all over and we are back to our lives, worries will subside.

There is no point torturing your mind.

Think about it this way - have your worries did anything productive for you in the past week, two, month? No. You just wasted your precious mental power. Instead you could've enjoyed your time.

But to move out during quarantine to live alone? Away from her boyfriend?
