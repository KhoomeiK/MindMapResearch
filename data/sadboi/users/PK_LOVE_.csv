The first season was interesting and off-beat, but compared to *Stranger Things* of all shows, it’s a complete mess. ST is lucky they got such a great group of kids... TUA is sort of stuck with its current cast. Hopefully the budget is better next season; me and my siblings couldn’t take the finale seriously because they clearly bit off more than they could chew in regard to CGI. Plus, the only characters anyone’s really interested in are Five and Klaus. Each of the main 7 has their fans but those two really carry the show.

At this point I don’t think Mother 3 will ever be released. It would likely come off as some kind of attack on western culture. If the magypsies alone aren’t enough to kill localization chances (not to mention the disturbing extortion of a particular monkey) then the villains’ Trump-like qualities are probably considered too political for release in the west despite the fact that the game came out in 2006. Congrats to the game for being creepily ahead of its time though. Without Mother 3’s localization or even a chance of a new game in the series, nothing really warrants any new representation in smash. There’s other dead series worth representing, and *plenty* of new stuff that should be added to the game as well.

If it’s all just a series of notes that already specify their pitch and duration, it seems kind of arbitrary to divide them into a pattern. The answer is basically yeah you don’t need a time signature to compose or read music, but the affect is has on reading and composition is still there. It creates a unique cadence and rhythm that can be combined with other sounds that effect the experience, and help to provide structure so the sound doesn’t feel imperfect, or deviate from the vision. We think of music and sounds in terms of structures of patterns so the time signature appeals to our cognitive processes for interpreting sound. 3/8 specifically carries an affect of frenzied panic since each new bar feels rushed in abruptly compared to what we expect since our “default” cadence is 4/4."

terracehouse,fqn5439,t1_fqn0cnx,1589488828.0,"I would agree with you personally that in general, it’s better to preserve life than to destroy it. But.. that’s still an opinion and not a fact. Who’s the authority that determines that killing is wrong? Is their authority so absolute that they determine what’s objectively right and wrong? I don’t know where you live, but both Japan and the United States have retained the death penalty, where it’s perfectly legal for people to be killed when a jury decides that person is guilty of crimes of a specific degree. In the majority of states in the USA have “stand your ground” laws which defend citizens’ right to kill people in self-defense.

For the sake of the argument, let’s say exceptions can be made in self defense or when a person’s behavior otherwise qualifies them as ethically kill-able. Where is the line drawn? What actions specifically disqualify a living being’s right to life? We kill bugs simply because we find them annoying, or gross. We kill fetuses when their birth is inconvenient, harmful, potentially traumatizing, and sometimes simply when the mother decides she she does not want to give birth. If killing is objectively wrong, then does the fetus’s right to be born outweigh the mother’s right to bodily freedom? Why is it a disgusting idea to buy a dog, kill it, and eat it, when it’s not a disgusting idea for a farmer to buy a pig, breed it, kill it, and sell its meat for consumption?

You may think “it’s different because those are animals and therefore not people”, but what’s the definition of personhood? If someone is born so mentally handicapped that their maximum thinking capacity and cognitive abilities are less than that of a chimpanzee, then what makes them a person that doesn’t make a chimp a person? Assuming you accept the theory of evolution, then have humans really always been people? We were once quite similar in appearance to apes, and before that we were quite like rodents, and reptiles before that, and fish before that, and single-celled micro-bacteria long before any of those. At what single point did a non-human give birth to a human that qualifies for personhood and therefore a right to live? Wouldn’t that distinction be arbitrary and not objective?

There’s no objective rules or laws to determine the morality of any of these situations— it’s 100% about what a group of people decides is normal and okay.

Yes, criticism and disapproval of the fashion in which LGBT pride is expressed is valid, and my comment wouldn’t exist if that’s what the original post was about.

What I said is completely valid. OP is welcome to hold whatever judgements they want based on stereotypes they dislike; my comment points out that the LGBT community is much more than rainbows, parades, and fat guys in gimp attire roaming the streets. The LGBT community overcame incredible obstacles to cultivate the environment where OP can be both gay and safe. The pride parades are a celebration of what’s possible for people that was impossible before, including OP’s comfort in his sexuality. If OP had said “I dislike the smug flamboyance of the LGBT community” that would be a different conversation entirely, but he was *denouncing the community and removing himself from it*.

Not to mention gaslighting yourself to believe your homosexuality is mental illness, turning yourself in to the police, putting yourself in situations that make you feel guilty of a crime worse than murder for simply experiencing gay thoughts, and getting all your friends to refer to you exclusively by slurs. Be sure to hide all your relationships and never marry as well.

If these things sound horrible it’s because they are, and thanks to the LGBT community, the stigma driving those actions is disappearing from the world. It’s ridiculous to reject the community for its flamboyance and for taking on an aesthetic embedded with sex. Sexual freedom is kind of what it’s all about. The overwhelming majority of LGBT people do not put their sexuality in the forefront of their identity or outward presentation, and you have a problem with the people who do that, not the entire LGBT community."

The future of graphics is in calculations and approximations consistent with real life physics and chemistry down to the smallest details, and that requires far too much processing power to replace the current methods of doing things which are much more about providing an illusion of visual depth and world-interactivity. We will move on from 3D modeling, hitboxes, polygons, textures, and built-in animations the exact same way we moved on from pixelated sprites, grids, ray-casting, and scrolling."

Not sure about the emotional aspects but lots of studies calling out game-based intelligence-improvement programs such as Luminosity for being complete BS did find that they help stroke patients and elderly folk in retaining whats not already lost. They don’t increase intelligence or build skills that transfer meaningfully to tasks outside of the program though. I remember reading about preservation of myelin sheath but then we’re getting into territory I don’t have the knowledge to talk competently about. Basically, they’re about as effective as sudoku, lateral-thinking riddles, and crossword puzzles which are all pretty easy to find abundantly for free or for significantly less money than those programs. As far as I’ve researched that’s pretty much all the information the field has on gaming and the elderly, so all of the factors you listed are excellent directions for future research!

Sufjan,fpsfab2,t1_fpotmgu,1588872495.0,"It’s not known for sure but it’s a very reasonable assumption. I described everything the best I could in the other comment thread that branched from that comment if you didn’t see it and you’re still curious.

I wasn’t considering that people may not have gone as far down the rabbit hole as I lol, I didn’t mean to come off as patronizing or elitist or anything"
Sufjan,fpsefn3,t1_fprw5yz,1588872083.0,"With Your Whole Heart and the positive nature of his latest social media musings seem to express that he’s in a happy relationship. I’m not “sure” in that I can’t really be 100% confident because I’m not personally acquainted with him, but it seems to me to be the most reasonable conclusion. 

I guess none of the lyrics really exclude the possibility of it being a woman because you could always argue that he’s artistically utilizing masculine imagery to describe a woman for some kind of abstract expression of his complex emotions... but it’s blatant enough that I think that interpretation qualifies as erasure. The first lyrics that comes to mind are:

> The strength of his arm / My lover caught me off guard

The subject matter and situation being described here doesn’t seem to change between lines, so ‘my lover’ is probably describing the same male who’s arm was strong. Probably a description of a violent outburst from his lover.

> In this light you look like Poseidon

Poseidon is generally portrayed as a muscular shirtless man, and Sufjan has made a habit of associating Ancient Greek imagery and mythology with sexual concepts, highlighting a separation from biblical imagery that separates his sexuality from his religion without losing the historical/mythological metaphors.

In John My Beloved, he uses a metaphor of John’s betrayal of Jesus to describe feelings of betrayal from his lover, referring directly to his lover as John. 

In Futile Devices, a sweet love song about the inability of words to capture his feelings for someone, he says “I think of you as my brother although that sounds dumb” referencing the person he loves.

In All For Myself, he establishes a pattern of describing the things he wants to completely absorb himself in which painfully do not describe his entire experience, and describes both himself and his lover as having “hairy chests”, and later says “out on the earth, I smell of you / a bathing boy, amazing you” and nobody else seems to be present in the song besides for himself and his lover

I don’t remember the lyrics to Venus exactly, but I remember it being probably the most blatant about what’s going on

There’s probably more, but those are the best examples I can call from memory. There’s so much depth to the songs it’s insane, it’s nice to find someone who enjoys exploring that! :) I hope I described everything sufficiently"

Sufjan,fppdnpa,t1_fpp97yn,1588800383.0,"Carrie and Lowell is pretty forthright and autobiographical in nature. He’s also been seen with male +1’s in public, there was a post on the subreddit some time ago that identified someone he took to a wedding he attended, it was speculated for a while that he was dating Andrew Ondrejcak (a NYC artist around his age) but it’s possible they were just hanging out as friends... but this was also around the same time he posted some cryptic blog post about a marriage proposal and a later blog post that featured a wedding band on what is presumably Sufjan’s hand. I’d be shocked to find out “with your whole heart”, the single Sufjan release specifically for Pride Month was about a heterosexual relationship, not to mention the Pride shirt designed by Sufjan which features his own name in rainbow. All this in combination with a plethora of blatant homoerotic sentiments in his music kinda puts the opposing assumption into r/SapphoAndHerFriend territory. It is very, very safe to conclude that he’s gay or at the very least that his most recent relationship is/was gay. But, it’s also clear that he intends to keep his private life private so he probably would appreciate the matter not being dug into any further. Let’s say he patched things up with the man he describes physically abusing him in C&L, it might be difficult for fans who care about him to let go if they weren’t present for the emotional reconciliation, and the situation could become toxic quickly. That’s just one idea though. Generally speaking it makes sense for someone who sings to a loving audience about love to keep their own love-life from the public eye."
Conservative,fpotl5r,t1_fpojauj,1588790433.0,"I used to be more liberal but I’ve arrived to a more politically neutral aporia as of late— so I don’t mean this as a political dig or to imply anything about electability/ethics, I’m just trying to figure out what’s real and what’s not. Didn’t Trump gloat about directly sexually assaulting people? The whole “when you’re a star they let you do it”, “I moved on her like a bitch”, “I’ll admit it. I did try to fuck her, she was married, and I moved on her very heavily” sort of stuff seems pretty damning.

Separate idea altogether: Liberals and progressives are in a tough spot since there’s three choices and none of them line up with their ethical values: vote within party lines for someone who’s probably guilty of sexual assault, vote outside of party lines for someone who’s probably guilty of sexual assault, or discard their democratic voice by voting for someone with no chance of winning or abstaining from voting altogether, inevitably resulting in one of the first two outcomes anyways. The conclusion I draw from this is that conservatives calling out the hypocrisy of liberal and progressive voters should feel less schadenfreude and more pity; the DNC has proven to be more powerful and dangerous than the massive group of voters who essentially lost their government representation because they were unfairly screwed out of it. The unreasonable people who excuse and joyfully endorse Biden are a loud minority, and the majority of liberals and progressive simply see him as a problematic means to a less problematic future. The way I see conservatives taking the 2020 election is by finding common ground with the left in the identification of liberal establishment as having denied them the ability to democratically choose their representative. Granted... the uphill battle would be convincing them that the right will represent them any better. Legalizing marijuana and/or replacing faulty welfare systems with UBI (which was a republican idea before ~4 years ago!) would be a bold but honestly safe set of issues to call a “compromise” that would take enough voters to kill Biden if you ask me, but I’m by no means an expert. I’d love to hear you thoughts on all this!"
sleep,fpofxzj,t3_gelpzr,1588783835.0,"I originally read the title as ""unusual wankings"" hahaha

I think it could be anything. I wouldn't discount sleep apnea, many people suffer from it without even knowing. That said, it could be anything-- even things as simple as stress in waking life, needing to use the restroom, getting dehydrated in the middle of the night, etc. The fact that you wake up with a racing heart is interesting... maybe you're waking up from nightmares and not remembering them? If I were you, I'd focus on having the best sleep hygiene possible (not eating too soon before bed, winding down away from screens, going to bed at the same time every day, maybe trying some sleepy tea) to control for those factors. If you're already doing that or you make some adjustments and nothing changes, then perhaps you could experiment with sleep-aids like melatonin. If you run out of ideas and the problem persists then I would strongly recommend talking to your doctor."
