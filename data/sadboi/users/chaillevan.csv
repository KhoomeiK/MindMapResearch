Late night rambles are good to show where your mind is at because thoughts come out more confused and in bits and pieces lol. Listen, I’m not saying you Have to go or that it’ll be Easy or inexpensive to go to therapy bc I dunno but I’ll tell you that therapy isn’t Always expensive ? Also usually students have access to university counselors through the health center so I encourage you to look into that ! I’m no longer in school bc I had to drop out, but I Recently had my first therapy appointment. And each hour session is a $25 copay which makes me feel So grateful. I genuinely believe everyone could benefit from talk therapy bc your mind is a beautiful thing, even when it’s full of dark thoughts, the mechanism ? Of the human brain is so complex and to me , therapists are the people that Studied the way human brains work and their job is to help ... Untangle our thoughts and give us the information and sometimes just the comfort.. of being Heard with no judgement. It’s so hard to ask for help, but you do Deserve Help, you aren’t less worthy of help because you Think your problems aren’t as important or Not As Bad as other people who are dealing with Very Difficult problems. You Deserve to be heard, you deserve to have Peace of mind , you deserve help bud, if you want to go get that help ? I’m so proud of you but even if you don’t ? Retraining thoughts is Very hard but I’ll say , every day is another day to start anew , when you notice yourself, being invalidating to your own problems ?

I really did call myself pan for a while, wore pan flag colors w pride etc bc of the mindset of loving someone’s Mind over any kind of Possible genitals they may have . I use bi as my label A Lot more now but I do just prefer Queer bc it’s just a Nice Umbrella term when I love People at the end of the day . Also bisexual has an easier sound to it ? I won’t have to.. explainnnnn Bisexual bc everyone knows what it is? Unlike pan where it just raises more question marks and as a pan person yourself ? I’m sure you’ve had to deal with that. I think Generally ? Pan holds the idea of loving all genders regardless of genitals . And sometimes bisexual has too much focus on The Binary genders. too many ppl act like pan Just means You Can be attracted to trans people ? But that‘a invalidating to trans people as if they are So different that they need to be set apart and made an exception ? Haha for labels that Can be so similar I think it has a Lot to do with the way an individual views Themselves And how they define the words Personally ... were all a part of this Large Spectrum of rainbow at the end of the day !

And obvs no one wants to deal with blemishes. Be gentle with Yourself. Not just bc you don’t want scars but also because if you pick it’s almost like repeated trauma to those wounds. It’s okay if you do pick but just Be Kind to yourself.
SkincareAddiction,f0z7bs1,t1_f0x50im,1569088184.0,It Can be good to squeeze it. It Can cause so much inflammation and lead to a lot of scarring. But if your acne Has a white head to it if you gently get some of the pus out it really can help them go away and release some of the pressure. It’ll stay trapped until something else acts on it to make it go away. If you don’t like to squeeze them I Totally get it though. I’ve had issues with picking since I was young. Idk what products you use but I like sort of holistic roller ball spot treatments too. Anything with tea tree pretty much. That tends to be a good go to option

SkincareAddiction,f0z6x33,t1_f0xxs6f,1569087890.0,"I did take a medicine for acne and it Did give me a Bad side effect. I was taking minocycline and I had noticed I couldn’t see as well and my mom At first thought I only wanted new frames. It can cause Optic nerve swelling. Also known as pseudotumor cerebri. Which sounds scary bc it was. If your optic nerves swell you can’t see properly even with your glasses bc the nerve is Inside. Very shitty situation and I obviously stopped taking them once we realized but I couldn’t take the antidote for it bc I’m allergic to it. I had to just.. wait for the med to get the hell out of my system. I was in hs at the time. I also had a lumbar puncture(spinal tap) during that so they can Check the pressure in your brain. (Also had a cat scan) the high pressure can cause the swelling: this isn’t to scare anyone but if you ever Do notice anything, trust yourself. Pay attention bc side effects are No fun and you must keep yourself safe. You know your body more than anyone because it is Yours."
SkincareAddiction,f0z6atk,t1_f0z4o5v,1569087445.0,Gosh me too.
SkincareAddiction,f0z68o1,t1_f0xjm2c,1569087404.0,True ! If anyone does get cysts a good way to help and hopefully soften them and make them less painful. A clean warm rag and you can hold it against it until you feel relief. The steam and everything from the hot wet rag does really help. Me and my brother actually did have to deal with some staph growing up.
SkincareAddiction,f0z61ns,t1_f0z506p,1569087271.0,Haha ! No that’s at the dentist !! Esthetician’s are trained to be gentle bc skin is so... sensitive and so easy to cause bruising or trauma
SkincareAddiction,f0z5vvg,t1_f0xjxu2,1569087161.0,Yeah I don’t see why you’re downvoted either. Probably ppl getting scared at the idea and thinking you’re pullin their leg ? I’ve had issues with skin and always scratching and picking. And I’m one of those that does watch pimple popping vids. They are really satisfying and when the person doing it is a professional ? It’s good to see the techniques they use. Dr Pimple Popper has mentioned that. It’s almost like that triangle in the center of your face. It Is like a danger zone bc it has so many connections to So many blood vessels !! It doesn’t have to be a scary thing you just have to be careful to never try to Force acne to pop. Be gentle with your skin ya know ?

bisexual,f0ww3sj,t1_evsudpb,1569015208.0,I used to call myself pan for a While but I use bi more now bc it really feels so similar to me. I love just using the word Queer as a very good umbrella term in general but i get why some don’t use it with the past and bad connotations it can hold. I make friendship bracelets so I love that perspective and haven’t made one in a whileee. I need to look up the poly flag now bc I can’t remember.

whatcarshouldIbuy,f0w6xpz,t1_extv7c7,1569000401.0,"They are really cute haha. My ex actually drove a Kia Soul. I drive a Kia Sorento. I think kias are hella cute. My sorento is a bigger style than the soul. More of a high off the ground kinda car so when I jump curbs,, or go down at a steep angle it won’t scratch up the underneath. I’ve had a Camry too which was a good one. Have you found a car yet ?"
