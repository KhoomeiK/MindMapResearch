FundieSnark,fr64yan,t1_fr5t9ck,1589919996.0,"Right! Like I sure they have lives and jobs and responsibilities too. With my parents or in-laws, they'd help even if it cost them time or money or if it was too hard physically on them and then I'd feel like shit. I'd only ask other people if my husband was literally physically incapacitated."
FundieSnark,fr64anf,t3_gmnnag,1589919673.0,"Holy shit. I read this to my husband and he was incensed by this. The very idea of going to parents instead of having the other PARENT of all these kids help with the work is mind-blowing. Is he disabled in some profound way that I'm not aware of? Or here's another thought- if you are that overwhelmed,  maybe try not having a baseball team's worth of children stacked on top of each other? I cant even imagine what a shitty quality of life she has.

We are a military family with two kids. We live almost 3,000 miles from either set of parents so we haven't had ""help"" or even babysitting. Ever in 14 years. And my husband has an incredibly stressful job, the kind of job that drives people towards alcoholism and suicide....and he still does at least 50% of the housework and child care. Happily. Because he helped create these human beings and he's aware of setting a good example. I cant even imagine having parents come help clean our house unless both of us were incapacitated."

Anxiety,fqa08db,t1_fq99dhx,1589210450.0,"Yeah, unfortunately I still do.  My kids are 13 and 5 now and I often find myself worrying about things like serious illness and even their longterm education. But it does seem less acute than that infant stage. It's not so much a fear of instant death or injury, it's more like a fear of something more prolonged like cancer or something. Man, even the chillest people become anxious wrecks during parenthood. Us anxious people dont stand a chance!"
Anxiety,fq8m5fa,t3_ghdulv,1589169475.0,"I dont have much advice. All I can say is that you are not alone. I had those exact intrusive thoughts about both of my kids hundreds and hundreds of times. I used to talk myself down by walking myself through different scenarios where those things happened but everything turned out ok. Like yeah, maybe I trip and fall with my infant but I manage to keep her from getting hurt and she cries but shes fine. Or shes just mildly hurt. Or maybe she's really hurt and we end up in the hospital but she recovers. Or whatever. I know it sucks and it's a type of anxiety that you're probably not used to but it'll pass. Just try to get enough sleep. Sleep is so precious when you're dealing with young kids. My youngest is now five and none of it ever even came close to happening. I have anxiety attacks about different things now!"

homeschool,fki3254,t3_fij73t,1584210981.0,"So I have somewhat of a similar situation with three ""tiers"" of grade/age levels to get through.  One preschool/kinder, one middle elementary,  two upper middle school. We don't use all-in-one boxed curricula. We use literally a different publisher/program for each subject and it was getting really overwhelming to me to schedule that much for such different ability levels and make sure everyone gets attention. If my kids were closer in age, I'd try to do some subjects together or work around a theme but that didnt work for us. 

Anyway, here's what I settled on and it's been working out well so far. I set school hours for each day (9:00 to 3:30). And I broke the day up to have three chunks. 

Chunk 1: (9:00 to 10:30)
I work with the youngest one-on-one and let the middle/older  kids do any easy/ independent work that they can get done including any reading that needs to be done.

Chunk 2: (10:45 to 12:30)
I send the youngest off to do puzzles, beads, art, craft kits, legos, building stuff, usually accompanied by the TV. I work one-on-one with the middle age. The older ones are still working independently.

12:30 to 1:30 is lunch

Chunk 3: (1:30 to 3:30)
Kinder does ""quiet time"" in her room.
Middle works on projects, reading, or independent work. I meet with the older ages and check in with what they're doing and do any in-depth work that needs guidance. 

Usually I do my school planning from 3:30 to about 5 and then we're done. Its exhausting but it works. One thing I've noticed is that if I give the youngest a really solid block of focused quality time first thing she will be happy to do her own thing later (for the most part). Anyway, good luck! You'll find your groove."
