::: Color Club Nail Polish in Catwalk - I have been doing press on nails lately because my nails are short AND because what I do for work, polish always chips. Not too excited about this, it’ll probably just be a toe polish.

:::Dome Beauty Cheek Envy Powder Blush in English Rose - I do love blush, so I’m looking forward to trying the this! It looks peachy on their website, but it is supposed to be a rosy pink. We will see!
