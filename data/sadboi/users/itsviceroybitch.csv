BPD,fpkum5t,t3_gdvigh,1588701311.0,"Yes I can definitely relate! I feel a lot of shame or guilt looking back at my sexual history as well, knowing that almost all the men I’ve slept with and one of the women I’ve slept with have just been solely because they find me attractive and I LIKE that they find me attractive. have you ever found that when actually having sex with those people, you don’t even care if you finish? It’s like as long as they do then that’s my validation satisfied so I’ll pretend, and then and get outta there as soon as possible cause I discover I don’t actually like their personality or they’re not my type?
It’s pretty fucked up now that I read what I wrote lmao but hey hey hey what’s new"
offmychest,fp97rpf,t1_fp97nzh,1588417579.0,"Also adding to this, you are a good role model to your sister solely by representing what mental health looks like. Almost everyone deals with depression at some point and I’m sure if your sister ever feels low, you would be a a comforting face, knowing that you understand her."
offmychest,fp97lg6,t3_gc0fp3,1588417397.0,"My parents have the same “work till you drop, or else you’re not working hard enough” attitude. I found when I was living with them, and living with depression, they weren’t purposely trying to make me feel worse, I’m sure they just wanted me to feel better, but it all comes down to being totally uneducated about mental health. If your parents really want to see you succeed, they should be strong enough to do the research on how to help you cope. in my opinion, the weakness here isn’t you not being able to manage your depression, it’s your parents who are acting weak. It’s easy to shun or invalidate a child who you don’t understand. It’s a lot braver and harder to do the work and make sure your child feels understood and loved no matter what."
BPD,foz5twq,t1_foytym6,1588185180.0,"Honestly I might be biased cause I think masculine girls look cute af, but like girl, even if you think you have more masculine features, it definitely doesn’t make you less beautiful- if anything I just think you can say you’re beautiful AND handsome :) which is wonderful! there’s a lot of very beautiful and handsome, masculine looking girls out there, particularly nowadays, as many people present as androgynous or NB etc! don’t put yourself down, I say you’re gorgeous at the weight you’re at, but if you did decide to lose any weight, it wouldn’t make you look any less of the woman you are"
BPD,foy23a3,t3_ga6yth,1588163389.0,"I think I get you- like sometimes as soon as I feel happy, it’s like there’s always some sort of existential dread or something behind it, away to burst through..
I don’t get it all the time, it’s mostly if I’m by myself and something simple makes me feel really happy, like birds singing or the sky on a nice day. Those are the times where I’ll get a burst of unbelievable euphoria for a split second and then it’s immediately followed by this bad, heavy feeling that I can’t explain, almost like I’ve forgotten something, and I can’t remember what it is, but I know it’s terrible and then I feel like I’m fighting to not let the happy feeling leave- while also feeling like I have no reason to be happy at all. I also sometimes get it if my SO makes me feel really happy and then I feel like I’m ruining the moment because the happiness is overwhelming- and painful, like you said! It’s really confusing"
BPD,fotxtqi,t3_g9juib,1588069961.0,"Gender’s v fluid and I do this with a lot of Male friends, celebrities or crushes too. Im 22, female- although I guess gender fluid is more accurate to how I feel about myself? I’m attracted to all genders so naturally I am very open minded with fashion. I guess think I just get fascinated if I think they’ve got a groovy style and I’m like damn I wanna look that sick and so I’ll go through little periods where I’ll dress with that style. I get you when you said do I wanna be them or be WITH them hahah, it’s very confusing- but I just take the approach of... does it really matter if sometimes my style and appearance is influenced by the opposite sex? like I think it just makes you all the more interesting and relatable, having an open minded approach to the way you present yourself to the world :)"
BPD,fotvhiz,t3_g9b3bz,1588067587.0,"Hi! my fiancé and I have experienced/are experiencing a similar situation- although most of my emotions are internalised, so rather than expressing anger or upset towards my partner, I mostly just make myself feel guilty for no reason and just shut down in quiet/spooked mode for a bit. So thankfully I haven’t had to have that chat with my partner, as I imagine that wasn’t an easy convo to have- well done for persevering!
What you were saying about your sex drives being out of sync, and the problems you’re feeling, I can really relate to. Do you ever feel like your partner not wanting to be intimate with you, affects your overall self worth? Cause I guess that’s how I feel a lot of the time, but I’m trying my best to recognise that, although I do have a really high sex drive- I feel like I just want to feel close to my partner, and for them to want me the way they did when our bodies were still new to each other! no matter how I rationalise it, I’m still just using physical intimacy as my main form of validation. Which is definitely a me problem and not really anything to do with my partner- I should find other ways of boosting my self esteem, self care things that don’t have to involve my partner, in order to be self sustaining I guess? I’ve talked to my partner about this a fair bit and how the lack of interest, or sporadic interest in me- sexually- really affects my mood, but I’ve made sure to emphasise that I’m aware this isn’t something they should be made to feel guilty for. I know that sex drives come and go and it’s perfectly healthy for her to go as long as she wants without sex, it doesn’t mean she isn’t sexually attracted to me, and i would never want to pressure her or have sex with her if it wasn’t something she was super into at the time. I’ve asked that my partner show me physical intimacy in other ways when she isn’t feeling sexual; more kisses, or even just a little squeeze of my thigh to show she loves me. She’s also really good for complimenting my body and making me feel lovely and sexual without even touching me- which I think really helps. She has told me that a lot of her low sex drive probably just comes from her own fluctuating self esteem and so I do what I can to make her feel beautiful and sexy without putting any pressure on her to want to have sex. I know none of this info really solves your problem but hopefully you can relate and my experience might help you understand aspects of your own situation that you hadn’t considered :)"
BPD,fonzltu,t3_g8ftns,1587929597.0,"I’m so sorry for your loss and I can’t imagine what you’re going through, but you sound like an incredible sister, and I would feel lucky to have you if I was your sister. Bpd is difficult and so even if it didn’t always seem obvious, I’m sure your sister cared a great deal about you, and would feel very proud that you want to understand her illness.
To answer your questions, I was diagnosed at 19, I am now 22, but I’ve always been deemed extra “sensitive” by my family mostly- and was experiencing mental health issues and the effects of bpd from around 12 years old, kind of around the time puberty hit so I think at that age it’s really difficult for your family to understand that what you’re experiencing isn’t your average teenage mood swings and emotional issues- and even more difficult for me to vocalise what I was goi nag through. Until a few years ago I considered my childhood to be very beige and didn’t see how I could possibly have bpd with such a pleasant upbringing. It wasn’t until I was diagnosed and forced to think deeper about my childhood, and realised I had been missing out large chunks of my life where I had been made to feel worthless or insignificant or stupid, and although I now know my upbringing played a vital role in me now being the way I am, I can’t say I hold it against my family. They did their best, I was born a sensitive kid and my mother and father both allowed their own individual issues to deeply affect me without even really realising. I have one older sister. We were pretty close as kids and we still laugh and joke about now, whenever we see each other. it does make me sad now and then as I don’t think I reach out to her enough, because although I know she doesn’t understand me 100% and probably doesn’t agree with me on many things, I don’t know what I would have done without her, growing up. And as an adult, I could not be more in awe of her. She’s wonderful and strong and everything I wish I could be. Maybe that’s why I don’t speak as much as I want to.. not exactly jealousy, more like shame or guilt that I don’t feel good enough to be a big part of her life, I wouldn’t want to ruin it or let her down cause she deserves the world. But yeah that’s some of my bpd experience, if you have any other questions or just need to talk about how you’re feeling, I’m all ears xx"

BPD,fmogg1y,t3_fwfl4o,1586258096.0,"I can really relate to what sounds like a bit of a complicated relationship with food and the impact of a parent who conditions your thought process surrounding food. my mum used to shame me for eating as a kid and I developed anorexia during puberty which truly has fucked with my body a lil bit. I’m “better” now as I’m not anorexic but I still have very complicated feelings with food- if you want someone to talk to more about your situation, I’d understand so feel free to pm me! You are not a pig by any means, what a silly thing for him to say, and how in the world does three cookies class as gluttony?? Sounds like your dad has an unhealthy relationship with food also, either that or he just likes to put you down in order to keep you unhappy and easier to control. Either way he should be ashamed for hurting you and not being more mindful of the power of his words. Much love to you- you’re beautiful and perfect, please when you feel ready, have another cookie or a little snack at least, do it for my hungry post-anorexic ass hahahah x"

BPD,fm5cwf5,t3_ft0ioj,1585770579.0,"wooooh yay other bisexual bpd peeps! Honestly I go through stages, I feel like overall being bisexual does make me feel more free, and allows me to appreciate everyone for their individuality rather than what their gender dictates they should or shouldn’t do. but I do go through phases (mostly if I’m depressed or wayyy too manic) where it does feel very confusing, sometimes I worry that I’m not bisexual at all and that it’s just because I’ve got a very progressive mindset and the fact that I love sex- however I do often try to remind myself in these moments that thats probably just my fucked up, confusing bpd way of feeling insecure about myself and relationships, not my actual sexuality! I know that when I’m not having an episode or a bad brain time, that I feel confident in my bisexuality so I do think that any confusion I feel surrounding my sexuality is a direct result of my insecurities; I don’t want men to sexualise my love for women just for their own benefit, but I want it to be known and accepted that I love women. Then when I am with women I feel like I can relax more because they understand what it feels like to be gay, but then I feel guilty because I like men too and I think I end up just bi-shaming myself into thinking I can only like one or the other, with my bpd “all or nothing” mindset I feel like I can’t possibly like both genders. but that’s just bullshit and simply isn’t true! we love who we love, I think being bisexual with bpd is a huge blessing, but on the other hand, it’s just another thing for my brain to turn into a puzzle."
offmychest,fm3wf4w,t3_fsgq5a,1585739480.0,"Oh god I can relate to this, I was literally the ideal weight or maybe just under as a kid and yet, a couple of kids had called me fat and it stuck with me, probably didn’t help that my mum was obsessively weight conscious and would always make comments or hint that my sister and I should go on her crash diets with her (I was still a kid when she did that which is a bit fucked up)- but it led to me developing anorexia age 11.
I eventually “beat” it but I still suffer from extremely fluctuating body image, between thinking I’m fat and ugly and disgusting and I don’t want anyone to watch me eating- to knowing that it’s dysmorphia and that I’m actually quite a thin girl, and that I shouldn’t let silly comments from the past affect how I feel about my lovely adult body! It just goes to show how sensitive and impressionable we are as kids, and how it can stay with you for years. But yeah fuck all the kids who called you fat, kids don’t know what their talking about and adults should know better than to teach their children to judge themselves/others on their weight! Love yourselves, cause you ALL are incredible and gorgeous!!"
BPD,fltkzhw,t1_fls55p1,1585477413.0,"Yeah I agree! I know for a lot of people weed just makes anxiety etc worse, but for me I feel like it slows my brain down just enough for me to be able to figure out what’s a good thought and what’s a bad bpd thought, does that make sense?"
BPD,fltkwsh,t3_fqln9g,1585477321.0,"Yeah I get this! I’ve never previously had a problem with falling asleep but recently, some nights I’ve found myself desperately trying not to let myself fall asleep, because my dreams are so vivid and often pretty traumatic. I also suffer from hallucinations, particularly when I’m feeling like my emotions or my life or something is out of my control. when I wake up from these dreams I have, it takes me like a good hour or two to calm down and trust that my partner isn’t trying to hurt me, and try and remind myself of reality etc. and those first couple of hours of the day for me are genuine hell, it’s when I feel my most uncertain, least trusting and most vulnerable, and I can’t stand that I feel that way when all I want is for the feeling to pass so I can get a hug from my partner and feel a fraction of reassurance that I’m okay. my partner doesn’t understand the extent of the psychological torture i get with these dreams cause I don’t know how to explain it properly to her, but it almost feels like when I’m confused with reality (whether it be because of nightmares or hallucinations) I feel like I have no control over my actions, like I’m scared of what I’m going to do or say because, if it isn’t real then it’s fine I’ll just kill my self or something to get out of the situation- I just don’t feel safe around anyone when I’m confusing reality, least of all myself. Also I don’t have a conclusion for this lil story I just thought I’d post cause I 100% relate to what you said hahah"

BPD,fk8q0k4,t3_fh2drc,1583960708.0,"Yeah I can relate- although I would consider myself an extrovert, I often feel like a lot of that is just the fake confidence I show people in order for them to like me. Cause I was quite a scared, shy kid too, always far too worried about being a burden and a disappointment than a child should ever feel. 
I guess in my later teenage years and now early adulthood I’ve grown and come out of my shell a lot, particularly since I moved out of my family home and started living independently when I was 18. 
but whenever I’m around my family, as soon as they say something subtly hurtful ,or even the people I care about who aren’t my family- if they make any jokes or digs that feel like a remark I’d hear from my mum and dad etc, I totally just switch back to being a terrified, quiet kid, so worried that I’m causing other people bother that I’d prefer just not to exist at all. 
Sounds a bit dark now that I read it back but I mean it’s nice to know other people get this too and I’m not alone!"

no matter what physical condition you are in, and no matter how many ignorant people tell you otherwise, you MATTER and you are worth far more than taking your own life, life comes and goes in waves, and with bpd it does sometimes feel like you’re drowning, but having someone you can trust, even if it’s a stranger on reddit, to help you float is something I think we all deserve. You deserve a bit of respect and appreciation for the fight you’ve been fighting your whole life with this illness, because it’s a lot harder than most people realise- you’ve done amazing to have come this far and seek help and it was very brave of you to post this.
