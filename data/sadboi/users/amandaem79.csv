unpopularopinion,fptu11u,t3_gfb6rj,1588898253.0,"I was a teen in the 90s, brought up by two functional alcoholics, one of whom was mentally and physically abusive to me. 

I was never taught about sex. I lived in a small town.  When I was a child, I was sexually assaulted by my mom's boyfriend (she later dumped him) and at 17 I was violently raped by a schoolmate, with no legal recourse taken as my folks preferred to sweep it under the rug. These traumas led me to be very sheltered sexually, and as such, I never really cared about learning about safe sex, and my neglectful parents sure didn't take the initiative. 

When I was 18, I got pregnant by my first serious boyfriend after dating for 4 months. When my parents learned I was dating him, they disowned me. I went to live with his family who took me in. 

My parents told me I was trash when they learned of the pregnancy. It wasn't until I was about 5 months pregnant that they started to warm up to the idea of being grandparents. 

Anyway, long story short, I didn't receive any prenatal care with that baby as my folks didn't think it necessary and they were ashamed of me. I ended up losing the baby in utero at 8 months pregnant due to their neglect and my naivety."
