Accutane,fp73jpe,t3_gbize7,1588363398.0,when studying pharmacology I witnessed this myself every single drug have it's own side effects. And tbh most of the dermatologists don't bother to inform their patients about these potential side effects because they consider general public incompetent & not educated enough. that being said yes it's a miracle drug for acne but there ARE side effects & we can't ignore them.

Advice,fgslw8l,t1_fgrjiaf,1581087548.0,"I scored 4 on self esteem test & 22 on ADHD test. yeah I think you are absolutely correct I think my fcked up self esteem is destroying me, I always feel I'm not enough even when things weren't as bad as they are now. I never thought my self esteem was playing such a big role for motivation & studies. Even though ppl do compliment me on my looks I never feel confident about myself. I think I attached my self worth to achieving good grades when my grades started messing up, my life started falling apart & i started using avoidance as a coping mechanism.
 thankyou so much for your time & energy I truly appreciate your kindness & effort. Helped."
Advice,fgp05ol,t1_fgo84td,1580993295.0,"thankyou so much for responding. yes I do indeed have depression, I think the first time I experienced was maybe 4 years ago. luckily I somewhat pushed through college & now I'm in university studying medicine. I was always an overachiever, position holder throughout my school years. unfortunately my mental health started messing up around 9th grade I'm very emotionally sensitive person,at that time a lot was going in my life which messed up my emotional health & i started seeing studying as a burden & ultimately I ended up messing up my first year of college. Now I adopted very bad studying habits which are absolutely not working, university is pretty hard I don't know how to stop procrastinating & I have faith in myself that i can do this. Last month being so desperate for help I went to psychiatrist & he indeed diagnosed me with depression & ocd. And straight up prescribed me zoloft (I asked him to give me option for therapy before medication) he told me it's not a big deal, offered me some religious advice & told me to eat bananas. 
Now I don't know how to manage my depression & studies which keep piling up, my relationships are falling apart & I'm missing out on normal things in my life. 
I'm missing classes stuck in home crying, my family  thinks I'm being dramatic & lazy how do I explain them I'm suffering from mental health issues (they don't believe in such things) 
My main priority rn is I want to be a good student again I love studying it's jst I can't manage stuff & get overwhelmed easily & shut down. having good grades  was always my identity & now I feel worthless & a failure . Sorry for ranting so long but I'm really desperate to feel normal again. Thankyou so much for your time."
