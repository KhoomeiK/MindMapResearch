BPD,fq99020,t3_ghdwdt,1589189951.0,"Hey! I hope I can help a bit with this, even if it's just a possible explanation. 

I am reading right now a book about transgenerational traumas, and it has a section about unwanted/unplanned children and it describes EXACTLY this feeling that you are doing here. Sadly I cannot quote, or recommend it directly as this is in hungarian and from a hungarian author (and I think there are no translations), however you can find a few things about it. 
There is a ""Prague study"" about following paths of such children, (and my book cites it), but its not as much about mental health. Also a lot if articles only focus on relationships,but maybe you can find a few good ones.

If you have the chance to explore this with a therapist it might help! Also, I hope this doesn't offend anyone, I really hope it gives a handle to this feeling and maybe even a path to healing."

While getting myself down to the negativity spiral, I felt chest and stomach pain, curling up, and a choking feeling. (And this is how i started getting panic attacks, based on the ""something is not okay with my body"") 

I have no healthy way to cope with it, not even many years after. I started cutting myself back then because this physical pain would act as a ""steam"" release, converting the emotional pain to 'real' pain, so my brain could deal with it."

Now most of the conflicts comes from chores around the house with my current S.O. 
But I had a wild period when I suspected that my ex was cheating on me (he chatted *too* much with a coworker) so I got an affair, and even when I actually cheated on him I was mad about him potentially cheating on me. (Which, in retrospect, most likely didnt happen)

I was initally diagnosed by my ex-boyfriend when we were 17-18 years old, as he was really into psychology (i think he is graduating now as a therapist), as I was unbearably clingy. 
I checked it, then started following some tags on tumblr, I really REALLY felt that I am 100% relating to those things.

6 years later I finally  went to an actual therapist (clinical psychologist), and told her that I do believe that I might have bpd upon reading about it. It was a bit ago, so I don't remember her exact words, but she said something between the lines of this:
""We are planning to work together, of course that your opinion matters, you know yourself the best"" 
Then she assured me that we will make tests to determine it, and voil√† I do have bpd.

I have a very similar problem. I grew up with my mom, who has serious anger/emotion management issues, meaining that she used to scream at us a lot, hit us. Between approx. 13-17 she came home usually very fussy and yell at us for every single tiny thing. (Most probably for issues at her workplace)
I have since then cannot stand my close ones being angry around me. I had this issue with each of my more serious relationships, that whenever we were at a home-like setting (mostly at their home, or when we already lived together) and they became angry/irritated I felt anxiety, fear, and if it was towards me then add ""fight defense mode"", too.

The worst was my ex boyfriend, (who most likely had an antisocial personality issue) who always had these rage episodes when he was playing LoL, slamming his fist to the table, he even once slammed his hand into a glass that broke (i think just by describing i am giving myself a ptsd flashback, great) and that made me have a full on panic attack, switching on the flee mode. I knew that he wasnt angry at me, so I tried to hold myself back and hide the panic. I cannot really remember how everything went down, but I ended up curled up and crying in the other room, while he smashed a glass to the wall, muttered constantly under his nose then started getting on his coat. At this point the inevitable fear of abadonment also joined the party so I started begging him not to go. 
Yeah, fun times. I've stayed with him for 1 more year in a pretty fucking toxic relationship which most probably worsened/helped my bpd to develop. (I was 17-19 then)

BPD,fcyfvuz,t3_ejhlal,1578079539.0,"Hey! 

I've been having a similar issue, and I've posted already here (tho not much answer received). My issue is that *I dont feel okay.* I can't tell what's wrong and it only appears to act up at nights, or when I am alone or I am tired. So it's not a constant issue, it's similar to an anxiety/panic attack just not full blown... Whatever, I've told about this to my therapist and she asked me to get a full check esp. on the lungs-breathing area. (Ventolin has worked when feeling short on breath - but it may just be placebo) 

Well as I am located in Hungary, our health sector is **utter shit.** Meaning, that I got an appointment 3 months forward - which then I missed and since then I hadn't had the money for a private health check. (I got it now, Monday is the day when I finally get to know if I have asthma or my mind is doing the fuckery) 

So the advice part: if are going to a therapist check this with her. If you don't, then maybe get a notebook and make notes whenever you are feeling the pain. Here are a few identifying questions that might be useful:   
\- When did you feel it, were you doing any particular thing?  
\- Where did you feel it?   
\- How did it feel? (Sharp, dull, long, short etc.)  
And bring this to the doctors office next time, so you don't have to think about articulating them as you already have them written down, and probably your GP will thank you that you already have it noted and they don't have to go through with these questions.   


What are your thoughts on this?"

In my opinion anything can be a trauma for a person, it does not have to be something that most people count as one. 
I had a very toxic relationship, and I still have maladaptive coping techniques, and some ptsd-like flashback - my therapist has confirmed that it is indeed similar.

In my opinion you should go ask for it from your therapist, even if it's not what you might need, it may open other options.

You might have heard about Ammesty International's write for rights campaign, where they flood the authorities with handwritten letters as a public pressure. (Its harder to ignore thousands of letters than thousands of comments)

We (as the sub/international supporters) could make it happen. Its pretty low effort, as you need a piece of paper/postcard, a pen and a en envelope with a stamp. 
I suggest writing for the UN or the USA gov. to intervene.
