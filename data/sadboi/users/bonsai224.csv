BPD,fqkask6,t1_fqjv9il,1589423489.0,So relatable. I’ve moved so many times and I don’t feel completely safe and sound. Dissociation from trauma makes me feel like everything’s foreign and even I feel foreign sometimes. It all sucks.
BPD,fpz2rvp,t3_ggbi2i,1589012747.0,"I used to do that with my best friend and her boyfriend. I basically ended up being the bad guy, because well, I was being clingy. So now instead of clinging onto her for dear life, I find other people to talk to and build friendships with. I find other hobbies and tasks to get done. It’s very typical when someone gets into a relationship that their time with you is less than it was before. It’s just the way it is. I would like to ask you to find other friends, and find hobbies so you’re not obsessing over your friendship with her. It’ll just hurt. She’s not spending time with him to make you jealous or ignore you. She’s probably in love and wants to spend time with him. Just remember she doesn’t want to hurt you and loves you too."

BPD,fplxo1m,t3_ge4zhb,1588721466.0,It’s called dissociation. There’s derealization and depersonalization. It’s a common BPD symptom. I have it constantly. I’m sorry you have to deal with it too. :(
BPD,fpllgox,t3_g4m9fx,1588714850.0,"Yeah, I dissociate about 99% of the time. I never feel connected, I’m on autopilot and pretty numb most of the time. There are seldom moments when everything’s crystal clear and they pass very quickly. It’s very annoying and it really sucks. I had 5 back to back traumatic events in 2014 and I’ve been dissociating ever since then. I realized that I’ve always been that way, it just wasn’t as intense or noticeable. Always zoning out and day dreaming before those traumatic events. I’ve always been a total space cadet."
BPD,fp2jtg9,t1_fp1un03,1588262981.0,"Yeah, I hear ya. My old psychiatrist, since I was in high school, didn’t “believe” in BPD and so I went a very long time being misdiagnosed. I wasn’t being treated for BPD when I should have been. But I don’t think it hurts to see if your therapist will talk to you about it. Just take a deep breath and tell them.

I texted him and called him. He blocked my number. So I’ve decided I don’t want to be with someone who can’t handle a little confrontation. Especially since the confrontation was over text. I’ve started to realize that relationship was toxic and I think I’m just going to focus on me right now.

You’re welcome for the link! :)"
BPD,fozfg95,t1_foz711m,1588189762.0,"I’m so sorry to hear that you struggle with paranoia so much. Are you able to talk to a therapist or someone about it? 

I’ve definitely been paranoid before that someone hacked my cellphone and was listening to my therapy visits, I would turn my phone off so no one could hear the conversations. Then I thought one of my best friend’s several years ago had another person listening in on our phone conversations for awhile. Then I felt like my best friend hacked my phone and knew everything I did from minute to minute because he tapped my phone and hacked into it, because I felt like he knew so much about me. But I think I probably just told him a lot about me. When I’m driving I feel like everyone’s watching me. I feel the same way whenever I go somewhere in public.

I’ve tried to just think, instead of being so paranoid, “So what if people find out certain things or secrets about me? What are they going to do? Kill me? Harass me? Laugh at me? I highly like 100% doubt I’ll get killed or harassed. If they laugh, oh well, I’m glad I could be of service and humor them.” Lol

I try really hard to remember these suspicious and paranoid thoughts are all in my head. But for whatever reason I accused my new boyfriend of cheating on me and demanded he fess up or tell me the truth and not to talk to me about anything until he did. Now he’s blocked my number and I can’t get ahold of him. I feel awful and I just keep hoping and praying he’ll give me a chance.

BPD,foxbzt0,t1_fowx24c,1588139484.0,"Thank you for responding. I totally relate with you about the boyfriend thing. I’ve been seeing my boyfriend since the end of January and I started thinking he’s cheating on me or I’m the side chick. Just because he works a lot and I can’t see him very often. He can also be a little distant because he’s going through some major stuff. This is a brand new relationship and I got all possessive yesterday morning. All he said was “good morning babe” and I started questioning him about the night before and asked him to answer a specific question and not talk to me until he answered my question. Now he won’t talk to me and I’m literally praying he texts or calls soon. I don’t know why I did it like that. He’s been having a rough time and I can’t believe I did that and I just have to wait and see if he’ll come back to me. I feel terrible. :,("

So I got photos with an address from a person. I was wondering if they came directly from that address, or if there’s a way for someone to send the photos to the person and that person to send them to me with the original address from the “someone”.

So ok, friend 1 sends a picture to friend 2 with friend 1’s address on it. Then friend 2 sends friend 1’s picture to me, it comes with an address. Is that address friend 1 or friend 2’s?"

Maybe it’s just because I’ve only experienced dating being in this generation and not in the boomer generation or gen x. But I feel for you. I’m giving up on dating right now because it’s just the sos every time. These people have no honesty, just want to string me along, just want a hook up and have no real connection, want threesomes, or want a sugar baby. I’ve always been a monogamous person, so it’s irritating. I’m not knocking others’ opinions on dating and marriage; I just feel like it’s damn near impossible to find someone who feels the same way I do about dating. Oh, and finding someone where we’re both attracted to one another lol. Good luck OP."

2. My dad was abusive and controlling, and narcissists keep you under their thumb by cutting you off from the world and making you dependent on them. My mother wasn’t allowed to work, spend time with her friends or have a life. That was his way of cutting her down. Just your sentence about this leads me to believe that you are in a toxic and abusive relationship. Please correct me if I’m wrong. Abuse isn’t just physical or sexual. It can also be mental, emotional and spiritual. There’s a lot to be read about toxic relationships and videos on YouTube and books. Good luck, and remember you are worthy of a loving relationship and an amazing life."

My gyno told me it was from HS. I just washed it well every time I showered and it eventually went away. Maybe use dial gold or white bar on that part for a while and see if it goes away. I also agree on getting a second opinion. Try a new gyno and also a dermatologist. Good luck. I’m sorry you have to deal with this too.☹️
