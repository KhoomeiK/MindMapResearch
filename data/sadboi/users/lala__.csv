PutAnEggOnIt,fbyzmwb,t1_fbyy51j,1577230731.0,"Oh, sure. Let’s see...

- 1/2 corn cob
- 1/2 lb “pork chunk” (that’s what they call it at the Mexican place down the street) 
- 1 bunch green onion
- 1 ramen packet 
- 1/2 tbsp chili flakes 
- 1/2 tbsp soy sauce 
- 3 cloves garlic 
- 1 egg
- 2 cups of cold or ice water 
- 1/2 tbsp olive oil
- salt to taste 

1. Throw the pork chunks in the old cast iron pan with some olive oil for like ten minutes on each side, until cooked through and slightly charred. Throw the minced garlic in about halfway through and stir regularly. Salt lightly. 
2. Boil the corn for like ten minutes. 
3. Put an egg in with the corn and boil it for like 5 1/2-6 minutes (no more) then immediately cool the egg in a bowl of ice-water for like a minute (to stop it cooking). 
4. Boil the ramen noodles as per the instructions in a separate pot (I use a little less water than suggested). Add the packet to the ramen plus the chili flakes and soy sauce, stir, and let sit for a sec. 
5. Peel the egg gently and slice in half lengthwise (I did that part wrong). 
6. Cut the corn away from the cob and salt it lightly. 
7. Combine the ramen, pork, corn, and onion into your favorite bowl and eat hot! (Serves one.)"

BPD,eogrqho,t1_eogh5g9,1558564240.0,"So the professor is not allowing you to hand in late assignments and the SSD office is saying they can’t force her? Seems like you have to chalk this one up to a lesson learned, and try to be more clear in the future about what your accommodations are and aren’t. I’m not saying it’s fair, but it seems like your only solution. Maybe it’s possible to clear things up with your professor by having a heart-to-heart about your conditions and why you feel the accommodations are necessary. Again not saying this is fair, but it may feel better in the end to know that at least you tried to clear the air. Don’t let the criticism get to you.

It turns out you were right of course and my friend didn’t bail on the friendship. She texted me this morning offering to hang out. I’ve been ghosted so many times it pretty much always seems reasonable to think that it will happen. My ex just ghosted me in February and it was heartbreaking. But you’re right, it’s not always reasonable to expect that, and even if it does happen we will survive. Thank you for this message. I’m sorry about what happened with you and your friend. I’ve lost best friends like that too and I know how devastating it can be. But I hope you will find someone who will be a little more understanding. I hope that with my relationships in the future I can be more open about my flaws and insecurities before they come out, so people can be prepared to not take it too personally when I go too far. It’s a struggle. It’s so comforting that we have this sub, where people who really get it can come and offer their experiences and support. Thanks again. Xo"

I just took some (professionally prescribed) anxiety medication and am trying to remind myself that I don’t want to be the kind of person who made me the way I am by making everything about me. People have lives. I need to live mine. BPD is a thing that makes being alone terrifying and painful but I think it’s something we can learn to cope with.
