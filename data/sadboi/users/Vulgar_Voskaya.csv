It‚Äôs best to watch not knowing much about both films, so probably you‚Äôll enjoy it! Do tell us if you‚Äôre done watching!

Edit2: Hereditary and Midsommar has some really creepy easter eggs or little details in the background. Watch out for it! It‚Äôs really good on second or multiple viewings too."
