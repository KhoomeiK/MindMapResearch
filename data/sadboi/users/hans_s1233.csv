Some people just have to pay a little more attention to it and that is ok, don’t fret

Easier said than done but I push myself to be an optimistic thinker, I’d rather tell myself today is going to be great than I’m going to be miserable. Sometimes it helps sometimes not but I’m going to keep trying, and I hope you do too. Keep fighting my friend :-)"

Be prepared, the stuff tastes awful and people prepare it in different ways but I’ve found it works best with milk or anything fatty will do. It’s a plug your nose and chug type, I would not recommend sipping the stuff it tastes and smells like actual dirt. I would typically prepare 1 tbs per cup, any more and it becomes unbearable (some can tolerate it better, but alas I cannot) and keep drinking until you reach desired effects I wouldn’t drink more than 3 tbs on your first time. Drink on an empty stomach for stronger effects, and do something relaxing and enjoy. Not sure how accurate it is but people often talk about reverse tolerance, and how the more you do it the better it works. Not debunking it, but I’m not sure it it’s a proven thing or something people make up? I’d recommend looking into it"

SuicideWatch,fgmz97n,t3_ezf3cu,1580934752.0,"If you have any a little bit of hope for a future that’s what I need you to hang onto, it is vital that you do everything in your power to stay alive because you would miss out on so many opportunities in life. Even a small reason to stay alive can mean everything, a pet, a parent, getting to see that movie you’ve been wanting to see, being able to taste your favorite foods again. I know it doesn’t seem like it right now, but life truly does get better. Teenage years and young adulthood can be some of the toughest times in our lives, especially with mental illness. As for now, I recommend trying to find some peace of mind like taking a long bath or doing something that you enjoy and can allow you to calm the mind. You are stronger than you know, and even if you don’t believe it yourself know that a random redditor someone in the world believes in you and wants you to keep fighting. Please take care of yourself.

Been to two different people, both times I felt I was being forced into it. First time I was in middle school and I cried upon entering because I didn’t want to see him so bad and quit after 3 sessions because I refused to participate. Second time was similar, but I was much more mature but still very stubborn about therapy. It was after exiting inpatient therapy at a mental hospital for a week and was made to go there. I tried to give him a shot, but he didn’t seem very happy when I told him everything was a-okay and told him I didn’t want to be there. He constantly commented on my tics and my shaking leg which made me nervous which I feel like a therapist shouldn’t do but I decided then and there I was done with him. 

I have a fear related to therapists that doesn’t fully show itself until I’m in the chair and forced to confront things, I don’t know how I’m supposed to overcome this."

I don’t know if he’s tried stopping, I suppose that’s something I could ask him. 

As of now I’m doing homeschool since a suicide attempt last year from mostly school related stress, and doing crazy high amounts of over the counter cough medicine to get high on a two day binge, so coming off of that among other factors set me off. The homeschooling has taken a huge weight off my chest, and while I’m working 30-40 hours a week at a fast food place which can induce stress I don’t feel nearly as shitty as I used to. I‘ve been sober about 4 months now, I have supportive family, and while the mental illness is still there I feel like I deserve to feel again. I don’t have a sex drive, it’s practically gone. It’s not like that naturally, it’s definitely been induced from the meds. I want to cry when it would be normal to be sad, but I often can’t at all and just sit around feeling awful."
