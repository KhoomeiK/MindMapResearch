I was taking the piss out on myself but I can see that how I wrote it wasn’t the best and can be an insult. I’ll make sure to do my research before posting again. & I’ll delete this one. Thanks again, it was an honest mistake."

Know you aren’t alone, I know I feel it but knowing there’s other people out there that actually understand even if they aren’t in my life.. we all just have to stick together and keep lifting each other up. We feel so weak, but the fact we are still here means you’re so strong even if you don’t feel it & I know that isn’t always helpful to hear. Just breathe & try to be gentle to yourself."
