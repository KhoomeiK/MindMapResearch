depression,fi99dlq,t1_fi91y4e,1582258893.0,"I've had my whole life planned out a few times. It changed. For example, I wanted a specific job, a wife,  and kids. Now I have an entirely different job, a wife (yay!) and no kids. I've worked hard to get where I'm at (most of that work being working on myself) and consider myself pretty dang successful. And to be honest, 15 years out of highschool I'm in an entirely different life than I thought I would be back then. And I'm very very happy about it (if you subtract out my anxiety and depression that is). Seeing my highschool peers move through life on social media, i'm suprised to see where they're at now too. They all thought they had their lives planned out as well. Funny thing is, the ones that have lived out those plans are the ones that seem the least happy with their lives. Roll with the changes, be flexible, and don't make long term plans. Instead, make long term goals. A goal is good, because if you fail to meet it, you gained something along the way and you just then chose another goal. Make plans, and you'll lose whether you make them happen or not. That's my advice there. 

Im not sure if that helps or not... What makes you think your life is going down the drain?"

I could suggest to her that if she's concerned about time, to schedule a longer block.

It had to happen then. I could have asked my wife if we could reschedule, but technically we're only supposed to take an hour for lunch so the same situation would occur any day we tried to run the errand.

depression,fbnwuts,t3_ee1lh7,1577004256.0,"My two cents: it sounds like this is a situation where your actions can speak volumes more than your words. What I mean is show her how you feel about her by just being there for her. Do what you can for her, maybe talk about her feelings/struggles with her and show her that you care. Be someone she can lean on. Ask her where you might be able to help. It doesn't need to be money. I agree that flat out telling her that you have feelings for her may not go well. Even if she has the same feelings for you, she might not feel comfortable acting on them right now with all she's dealing with, so it could be too much pressure for her. Just be a steady rock for her to ground herself on, and she'll get it. Take the time to see her and spend time with her, it doesn't need to be a date. It's okay to tell her that you care about her, just don't push it. I'm not sure you're in a position to help her more than that, but trust me, that's probably more help than anyone else is giving her right now. Do that and not only will you help her but you'll get a great relationship out of it. Voice your true feelings when things are looking better for her if you can."

I rejected two anxiety/depression medications before I found one that I feel works well enough for me. Maybe talk to your doctor about other options?

depression,fbnq4wu,t3_edzuug,1577001573.0,"Getting help doesn't mean that there's something wrong with you. Humans are social creatures by nature. We're not all designed to live life by ourselves, and everyone needs help sometimes to get through it and feel happy about it. Think of it this way: if you don't actually have clinical depression, then what you have is something that is making you feel crappy, and that deserves getting help. Or else it may never get better. You might as well have depression. If you do have depression and you don't go get help, then you're not doing yourself any favors. You don't need to commit to being broken to go get help."

Not getting out of bed until late on my days off. Showering is often too much for me to handle, so I don't if it's too hard. That's how I cope and recuperate, and that's okay. She often can't stand joining me when I do these things, so we have a mutual unspoken agreement to support each other when we can, and allow each other to take care of ourselves when we need to. For example, on a Saturday, she'll go hiking with the dogs in the morning while I sleep in, no hard feelings. Maybe you and your husband just need to talk about it out loud?

Our symptoms of depression and coping mechanisms are the same way; similar, but equally different. When I feel upset, or angry, or sad, etc. due to my depression, I tell her about it and let her know that I realize my emotions are not rational. I ask that she lets me deal with them the way that I need to, even if it's different fron what she would do. Even if it means changing plans to stay in bed instead of visiting friends.

Look for ones who are board certified, their diagnoses are held to a higher standard and are more widely accepted by governmental agencies (ex. FAA) than non-board certified. The USMC will be more likely to listen if you go this route. A psychologist will be able to help you if your problems can be treated without medication. A psychiatrist will be able to help you if medication may be the answer. You probably don't know the answer, and neither of them will know it either, until you all find what works for you. Be open to both medication and therapy, even at the same time if needed. Most importantly, be truthful to your doctors or you may never find the solution."
USMC,fbmvwrr,t1_fabpwam,1576989504.0,"Just for clarity, you may be attempting to initiate a conversion to try to help, but your comment is easily perceived as derogatory. To the general population, depression has a broad spectrum that includes situational or seasonal emotional disturbances. It's natural to try to ""talk it out"" in these situations, even for the one who is struggling. To those who are educated in the subject (and most of the time those who suffer from the disorder aren't educated), depression is not externally manifested. Humans don't become depressed over something outside of their body. Instead, they become sad, or frustrated, or discouraged, or a million other things, but not depressed. I'm not saying this isn't dangerous, as I personally know a few who have intentionally made the ultimate sacrifice due to situational and temporary circumstances. It should be treated just as fairly. My point here is that your comment implies that OP's struggle is the outcome of his/her inability to cope with a situation and strongly suggests that they just need to change something to get better, which could be the case; your comment appears to discount the disorder of depression entirely, and that can easily be considered derogatory. Btw, no down votes from me, as I'm sure your comment was in good taste. I just wanted to try to share some clarity for you and other readers. Next time try something along the lines of ""I'm here to talk if you need. Otherwise, I hope you find the info you're looking for""."

I think you have great potential. The mustache is too long, and hangs over your lip a bit, which makes it look like ""pubes"". I think the beard only needs some style work. I mean, technically facial hair IS pubic hair. As people with facial hair, we strive to make our face pubes look appealing. This is never an easy task.
