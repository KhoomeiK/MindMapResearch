BPD,fhihsk7,t3_ev5upy,1581625022.0,"everything in this post rings true for me so, so true. i like to define my BPD like this:

there’s no grey area. ever. it’s either love or hate, angry or overjoyed, panic attacks to reckless behavior. no middle ground in my life. 
my boyfriend (FP) is the only sense of stability in my life and sometimes i hate him. i take his words too personally. 
ex. he’s 21, i’m 19. i can’t go out to the bars to drink w him on his birthday (he turns 22). he isn’t dropping all his plans to hang out with me or ensure that i can be included in his birthday celebrations, so that means he doesn’t want to be around me, doesn’t love me, and is planning to break up with me. hell, he’s probably telling his friends how much he can’t stand me right now. 

i cope by banging my head on the concrete walls of my dorm room and chain smoking cigarettes and weed. i spend every penny in my bank account. i drive 25+ over the speed limit. i impulsively bleached my silky red hair with the intention of coloring it blue. 

there’s no fucking peace in my mind, ever. i can’t focus on assignments and there’s no safer place for me than my bed, but yet, i want to go “home.” i want to feel safe, validated, and secure, but nothing anyone does to  help me feel safe is good enough, ever. 

i am helpless. i hate myself. and i will probably end up dead."
