dating_advice,fokoxfe,t3_g7vtpl,1587846164.0,My current boyfriend used to be a co-worker of mine. Keyword being used to. Dating someone from the same job isnâ€™t necessarily bad but you do have to be careful. I always say that if you like some from your job and they like you back (which it seems she does!) then go for it. Just be aware that things could get awkward if you break up especially while in the same job.
