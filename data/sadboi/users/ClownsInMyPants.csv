On a different occasion the same facility lost a patient who wandered into our yard (I live near the place) my house has woods thats almost a straight slope down into a river, had we not found this patient trying to dig under a fence (poor woman had dementia) she could've died, she had dirt on her like she fell once already.

CasualConversation,fr2il4p,t3_gm2qhq,1589837920.0,"I been suicidal and depressed since the age of 5 or 6 and have thought of suicide every single day since then, I live with 2 alcoholics one who is emotionally abusive and borderline insane whos driving me insane. I am chronically ill and can't sit nor stand for extended periods of time and some days am bedridden and I need my health insurance so I'm discouraged to get off the barely livable SSI I'm given. Once the remainder of my abusive family is gone I will be unable to take care of myself, and I plan to end it all anyways as there's nothing going for me especially with how the US is headed.

 I'm on my 10th therapist, been in therapy for 10+ years, no form of therapy has helped me and have been on enough medications to set up a small pharmacy, I have no will to live, half my support system died in 2018 when my best friend and mother passed from cancer. I'm left to take care of an alcoholic insane father and a incontinent miserable grandmother and occasionally 2 drug addicted brothers.

I have PTSD since childhood from my father beating and screaming at my mother and terrifying me, so I do as he says and never talk back, He's insane and talks to himself nonstop to the point where I have misophonia because I cannot stand the sound of his voice now, I've bawled in my room because he wont stop talking. ever. If he's not spending all his money on alcohol its on scratch tickets. We're in poverty and cannot afford this but I get screamed at if I bring it up and go into a PTSD spell.



 All I wish for and all I've prayed for for 20 years is to die because I'm sick of the pain. I nearly got dependent on benzos because of my father setting me off, as well as cutting but stopped because It's too much of a pain in the ass to hide the scars and explain them away. I can't explain to my therapist how I feel because that'll be a oneway ticket to the mental hospital, besides what will words solve? nothing.

There is nothing for me here, it will not get better if it hasnt for 20 years, and I wish I had the balls to end my life now. Those are my troubles."
