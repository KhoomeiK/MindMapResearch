Other musicians I know relied solely on performance for their income so they lost everything.  They would be on jobkeeper or jobseeker now.  If gigs haven't resumed by the time those payments end/get cut back they'll definitely be struggling.

My husband's band usually does several international tours a year but that's all off for at least a year, if not more.

It's not something I ever would have pieced together without reddit as I'm not externally hyperactive at all.  I somehow stumbled across a /r/ADHD post with a person describing their life with inattentive ADHD and it was such a ""holy shit"" moment because they were 100% describing me, including some really obscure 'quirks' and habits I've had since I was a kid.  I spent weeks scouring through people's stories on there and it was incredible.  It explained so much about things I'd never liked about myself, and it also explained why I wasn't making any long term progress with my eating disorder, anxiety and depression.
