BPD,fhvrd8d,t1_fhvob50,1581900477.0,"Hello, 

Thank you very much for taking the time and courage of sharing your own experience. 

I really hope you can find some ways to cope with these trauma and be able to function in a way that you can find some joy among all of the pain you've gone through. 

Your story sounds like a very very challenging one and I'm grateful that people who have been through so much can manage to find the strength to share and help those who also don't know how to deal with such feelings and emotions. 

I can relate to many of the things you said, not desregarding your journey, and just know that all our feelings are valid. We re here for each other and we can understand. I also found myself misdiagnosed for almost 15 years because of severe depression, anxiety disorder and PTSD on top of PBD, so I'm also trying to find a way to manage it all and digest my whole life through this new perspective. Even though it feels like I don't know how to behave and it's all so very confusing, I can now understand what I was doing wrong. 

My biggest problem to be honest is that I also blame my parents heavily for this because I know they were the ones who caused me to grow up into these abnormal defense mechanisms, and that I know will be something that will hunt me for a long time, if not forever. 

It all gets so messy when you have to deal with all these things and still be aware of how you act along with people. It's such a big burden to carry... I really can't imagine what you ve been through. 

Just gotta let you know that me and sure a lot of this community is here for you and we understand you a validate how you feel. 
You are not alone. 

Once again, thank you very much for sharing and I really hope you find some peace out of all this. 

❤"
BPD,fhvnwn5,t1_fhvmo6z,1581899400.0,"Thank you for sharing your experience. 

Yes, I'm starting to become aware of the stigma about all this, even among mental health clinicians because it takes some hard work and time to re educate our perspective on how to deal with life. 

I feel like it's a huge burden we carry coming to realize how bad we re dealing with people and everything in general with a brain that sabotages ourselves. 

I really want to believe that it's possible to try to retrain ourselves to react with some normality and be able to function. 


Like you said, I too was only aware of how many people suffer with this when I joined this sub Reddit, so I've been trying to use my own experience with BPD to try to help others dealing with this for as long as I'm able to.

Thank you for commenting."
BPD,fhvlpt7,t1_fhvl57a,1581898729.0,"Do you do therapy, and if yes, has it helped with dealing with it? 

Can you feel any improvements in controlling your impulses on these triggering sittuations now that you're aware of having the disorder?

BPD,fhvkqt0,t1_fhvk3s2,1581898355.0,"I can complete understand that feeling, even though I really am trying to change my behavior now that I notice that it hurts people. I feel like now that I know, I'm always afraid of hurting someone again."

BPD,fhu1t15,t3_f4v4du,1581880860.0,"Hello, 

As a person diagnosed with bpd, I can relate to what you feel and want to reassure you that your feelings are valid, always. 

These kind of problems will happen all the time, throughout our lives, like for anyone else, but we have to keep some things in mind about not mixing ouselfs within our personality disorder. 

We know our triggers better than anyone else. We know how they make us feel and we know it's the wrong perception we have of dealing with our problems, which is not reality. We have to keep that in mind, always. I know how hard it can be, but we are the only ones inside our heads acknowledging things in our own way - the way our brain learned how to protect ourselves. 

We have to find coping mechanisms to deal with it as well as we can and also be able to explain our perception to whoever we re dealing with when we split. 

I believe your boyfriend wants to help you with your problems, since you are in a relationship with him. 
I understand you perceived the following of the argument like you did because that's what our heads do: turn on alert mode and overthink situations instead of trying to find a way to solve the problems. 

From my own experience and how I deal with situations like this, I always apologise for the things I said or did that I was not really aware of during a bad episode and also explain what happened and what caused my attitudes (the triggers and the following symptoms). 
Also, keep in my that you should not blame yourself for everything bad that happens, just deal with the situation by explaining your feelings and emotions. 

Once you start understanding more about how this all works, you find the best coping skills for you to deal with it and so your loved ones who want to help you. 

Be honest with him, when you are ready to do it, and communicate. 

You will feel better."

I think it made us girls much more self aware (in a bad perspective) of own bodies during sex. I can say I kinda overthink it while doing it sometimes, things like ""do I look good from his PoV?""."
BPD,fhtu392,t1_fhts0df,1581878189.0,"I understand completely. My diagnose of bdp also took almost 15 years to be assured because it was happening at the same time as depression, and all psychiatrists just kept medicating me with all sorts of drugs and it never changed for the better. 

I just came to realise my actual symptoms of bpd recently and all my life started to make sense all the way. 

Also I think the misdiagnose still happens this much because of the stigma on this disorder around mental health professionals and whatnot. I felt that my whole journey around this was clinicians not wanting to get deep into what was really going on because it was easier to numb the patient with meds than take the time to solve the real problem.

The worst about finding this out so late is the huge amount of guilt you have to bear when you realize your head sabotaged it's way through your whole life so far and all the mess that has happened because of it becomes the greatest of burdens and can be very damaging among all the self hatred we feel."

AskReddit,fhlm43p,t1_fhlgsgs,1581702066.0,"I think this can be as tough of a situation for the person who suffers from mental illness as for someone who wants to help them and has to deal with it. 

It my relationships, I always tried to be as honest as I can about how I feel and how situations make me feel overwhelmed and through communication we are able to manage things in the best way possible. 

I feel much better when my partner tells me what he feels and tries to understand my emotions. 

When in a crisis, it helps me a lot when people just talk to me and validate my emotions through showing interest in helping me and be available on that moment. The worse someone can do to me is not taking me seriously and too lightly when I try to explain how I feel because it is very hard to even have the courage to come out with our emotions without feeling like a mental person, it's a shameful act for us and being taken seriously is really the turning point to be helpful. 

It's a journey. It can become a very big weight and interfere too much with our daily life and relationships and sometimes its a bit hard to function, but with time and the right help we will be able to come up with some tools to cope with our feelings and these situations (it's valid for those who deal with mentally ill people too). 

I can advise you to learn a bit more about Ptsd and depression and how does it feel like in the point of view of someone who suffers from it. You can find very educational information about in on youtube, I do it myself to understand my mind better. 

I really hope you find the best ways to cope with your loved one who's having a thought time and help them in your best way. also don't forget yourself in the middle of it, it can be really exhausting."

Usually we want that attention, it is really comforting to be reminded people care about you and how you feel. 
Be honest with them, always, you should say what you feel about trying to help and asking how is it the best way you can do it. Just do it kindly instead of abrubtly - I can understand how exhausting it can be dealing with a person with ptsd, I feel that way about myself and I really struggle to deal with partners in relationships because I can snap on the smallest of things and it's not their fault. 


No, never ignore the self sabotage. It can end up badly and might be dangerous. Self sabotage is automatic in our brains. When I split at my bf, I have a really bad attitude that I try to control as well as I can but you loose a bit of rationality in those situations. Be there for the person. Ask especific questions about what they feel, it helps us calm on these situations, just don't ignore it otherwise it gets worse always. When someone snaps at you or is having a crises, just never ignore them and take their emotions seriously showing interest in helping as best as you can. 

I hope I'm explaining myself in a perceivable way. It can be a bit confusing to put all these informations together. 

Be welcome to ask me whatever you need, I'll try to help you as best as I can."

All I can help you with is my own experience. 

I have borderline personality disorder and my relationship with the people who are closest to me can be very hard. I always feel better when people care to ask about how I feel, it really conforts me. I hate when others try to question why I feel this instead of that or keep coming up with ways of solving my feelings, because it's hard to explain how a mentally ill brain works to people who don't go through it. 
You gotta be comprehensive, patient and try to comfort the person as much as you can without suffocating them. Ask questions kindly about the feeling they express to you. Don't assume what they are feeling whitout asking them first, it can go very wrong. 

We tend to self sabotage our relationships when we don't feel good with ourselves. You just gotta keep that in mind and be gentle with that.

Also, try to be aware of what triggers a negative action while in a conversation with a person with a mental disorder, so you can avoid that. It helps very much."

Once, when I was coming home from high school like 7 years ago, I was having a very bad moment on the bus. I can't really hide my emotions when I'm into that kind of place mentally. 
The bus was full of people, totally packed and I hate these kinds of places. I managed to find an empty seat and just waited till getting back home safe with this fight against my own mind. 
There was an older woman sitting in front of me that kept staring at me and smiling everytime we crossed our eyes. I smiled back because I don't really know what to do on those situations but tried to avoid looking at her since I was almost crying. 
After like 15minuts of the trip, she turned to me, asked me to take of my headphones and told me ""you are such a beautiful young girl, never question that about yourself. You are strong and so so beautiful. Better days will come"" - I was so chocked, I started crying and just smiled at her and thanked her kind words so much. She has no idea how much she helped me through my life with such a simple gesture. Everytime I felt lost and hopeless, I thought about her words and it all got a bit more bearable.

I find this happening more often when my system turns into alert mode and I split. I tend to not get into verbal arguments because I know how my head works, so usually I shut up and start using sarcasm as a coping mechanism to not hurt anyone's feelings too much until I get back on track.
