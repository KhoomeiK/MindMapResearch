If someone is lucky enough to grow up poor but able to get to an elite college, then able to quit their soul-sucking work fairly young, meet interesting (retired) people who have worked undercover intelligence, travel as an American and learn from other country's perspective how the USA operates its ""international policy"", and get smacked in the face by their own childhood traumas and  broken by a tragic relationship- and dig themselves out from that with a deep dive into the psyche- people would have a life like mine.

CoronavirusMemes,fpf4nab,t1_fpexrd1,1588561684.0,"I don't discount these articles, for these were the reasons I seriously quarantined myself. When I had to leave the house and saw people in groups, not wearing face masks, and that our infection rate has been steady for a month with zero deaths despite having a high-risk population full of retirees- something is simply not adding up. We're down from Seattle- there's no reason not to be struck here big time with the way people are lax about social distancing (due to careless lack of fear, not an overt defiance). But nothing. I'm still kinda shocked. 

If those studies were accurate we would have increasing infections and death in this area. The Seattle and Houston overflow hospitals would be in use, rather than closed up already without seeing a single patient.   
New York I can't figure out fully. It seems like he lockdown is justified while many other locations are simply not at this point, as the predictions did not match the reality after several months.

Sweden kept their economy open and people employed and their covid-19 mortality rate is only .02%.... isn't that far less than what people die of the flu or other natural causes in each year? This is a reasonable approach that doesn't hurt more people than it helps. 

Absolutely the high-risk people or those who are too scared and don't want to work should be protected - however in the USA this is \*not\* what our money is being spent on. Instead people get a meager stipend while their debt increases and most of their bills continue. 

People of higher economic status can wait it out; most of America can't afford to. $400 is the average emergency savings that a person has. Surely that is spent by now. I think the only reason people aren't protesting here is everyone still has money. (Retirees and well-heeled ex-Californians) 

The government mandating that people stay at home during a crisis, without freezing their bills as well, tells me enough that they don't want to actually help people because it knowingly puts them in a worse situation afterwards.  And we could, as a nation, protect people from accumulating debt and from dropping into a lower economic status while we sort out the data on coronavirus. Instead, large corporations or institutions are bailed out instead. Why?  

More on this point in an entertaining way (disclaimer: strong language) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLcNStHTDjM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLcNStHTDjM)

I know time will tell much more in the future. These are avenues to ponder. If I didn't live here and see that all everything I read (mostly from Dr. Eric Ding) simply did not match up to what's steadily happening, I probably wouldn't have ever posted a meme like that.

CoronavirusMemes,fpetajp,t1_fpdp6b1,1588554470.0,"Tell us then, how many times less is Sweden's Covid-19 mortality rate compared to the average USA flu mortality rate? 

Why is this BS or just a mere talking point? 

Sadly, I was. And you're right I sucked at finance. I excelled in strategy and mgmt. I dropped out of that world after 7 years and have never been happier.

I know how it works in the inner circles by being around it enough from the outside. The 1-2% are not your friend."
CoronavirusMemes,fpcid30,t1_fpcenpa,1588501630.0,"I don't think so because we don't have a robust social welfare system, that's part of the problem, and why so many people need to go back to work. The area I'm in is full of high-risk retirees, with lax social distancing. We should have been hit hard but we have low infection numbers, zero deaths, and holding for nearly a month now and local hospitals are empty, never at capacity. May 1st we were predicted to have many deaths and a steep curve. And nothing. There's tons of people meeting up in parks and walking together or getting take out from restaurants. Only about 1/2 the population wears masks. We're also on the main interstate artery between two large cities. It doesn't make sense from everything I heard on the news. Hence this post.   
The majority of USA people don't have a backup dole system to rely on. So when our government mandates the greater economy to stop, without also stopping our bills, it puts people in debt, and crashes local economies (smalls shops, not corporate giants that get bailed out). The CARES act didn't have enough money to cover everyone's small business and big businesses were even able to use/abuse? that money though it was not meant for them. The people are getting screwed.

If it continues at this rate, and it is in some states, it's a tacit form of class warfare. Poor, desperate, scared and hungry people will become dependant on the government who has our remaining money to pay for food and shelter. Following a Sweden model and using our tax dollars to give stipends to high-risk or very scared people so they can choose to stay at home if they wish is the humane and sensible direction. To withhold our livelihoods without providing a real solution is breaking people and showing where the current politicians' alliances actually are: big businesses, and the elite global stakeholders, the 1-2% class. The news and media is not covering this aspect of reality as it's a very unifying topic and it's easy to understand why when one finds out who owns TV and top newspapers. It's the same league of people and their related businesses.  


The government's COVID-19 management is distressing the population needlessly at this point and suicide rates, domestic violence, and mental illness over intense distress is on the rise. If the government actually cared for its own people it would freeze our bills until the virus passes through. They aren't. If the news cared to help the people by informing them they would create a cohesive message and present a circumspect hopeful view, rather than a fear-bound divisive one. Yes, there are a few people behaving crazy, some truly are, but others are well-informed and simply mad at what's happening. They need to work. They do not believe that a .02% death rate justifies the death of the entire economy and all the lives that collapse with that. Not many people know about the doctors and nurses being censored and silenced or fired for speaking out, or having a differing professional opinion. Why the censorship? Strange days. Let's have a real discussion in America.   


Right now the situation is economically crippling the working lower class and will soon hit the middle class which will eventually make the rich wealthier relatively and because they have the stored wealth available to buy all the assets at a discount. The existing competition will also be eliminated or consolidated.

CoronavirusMemes,fpc3k80,t1_fpc3abs,1588486468.0,"Which makes it a bit more than half the rate of other Nordic countries.

However, Sweden also has approx double the population of the other Nordic countries...which was conveniently left out. Their Covid-19 death rate is .02% without a lockdown, or putting its citizens in fear and debt.

Americans who are high risk, just like the Swedes, should have the choice to stay safe inside their homes while the economy still broadly functions so everyone has a good life circumstance to return to."
BPDlovedones,fp9u4ql,t3_gbsrh8,1588434602.0,"I also already had CPSTD before I met my expwBPD. I'm concerned that based on what your therapist told you ""set a time to think so it won't preoccupy your days"" that this professional is not trauma informed, or not very well. It took me 7 months to start feeling better. I'm a year out now and am finally looking forward to my life again. If at month or two out, someone told me to not think about it, that would been the equivalent of telling me to stop a burning building with a water gun.

*Please note if you find your current therapist supportive and helpful then that's great and important, I just want you to be aware there is a whole body of trauma work that many therapists are not privy to depending on their interests and training, and that this information and guidance can really help ppl esp those with pwbpd or ptsd...

It can definitely layer in a new trauma. However once I moved through it mostly, I'm now able to work on the deeper layers (childhood) which unconsciously drove me into a very abusive relationship with a borderline. 

I had 2 therapists (tested 5) and recommend looking into somatic therapists/experiencing to help move the trauma out of the body so the brain won't have trauma food to keep looping over. And Irene Lyons work on YouTube. The CPTSD Reddit group is also worth checking out. Best wishes."

There's freedom in not caring. And honest to gawd there's some people out there who have that 6th sense where they can just pick up something is off with another person and easily understand what's playing out behind the scenes. I need friends like those; wise and not easily poisoned.

As if it's your fault or subtly shaming you by comparison. OMG how awful. And the fact that you know soo many of her personal issues is a huge red flag methinks. Based on this behavior if she did refer you to anyone, I wouldn't trust her judgment at all. Test the waters with someone else, or a few who are unaffiliated when you feel it. Don't give up, trauma-informed ones are out there who would never pull that BS on you. So gawd awful. I would consider reporting her   if you had the energy. I wouldn't. But please freaking move on and don't let this foul experience stop you from good therapy. I had 2 lousy therapists 15 years ago (didn't know there were different types with different trainings) and I stopped therapy. I really wish I hadn't. Would be SO much farther along in my life. Trying to catch up fast, and its possible with good support. 

Possible lesson learned here - ditch the ones that don't feel good with your gut. You're the boss, not them. You hire THEM. And exactly, you nailed it, many therapists need serious therapy themselves. The best ones are the ones who did do extensive therapy and can help support your own healing through their first-hand experience and relatability as well. As in they have more experience beyond the textbook or lab-like observations.

CPTSD,fm6xk77,t3_ftcy92,1585806252.0,"My opinion, hope this helps. Throw away if not: The virus is real, but mercifully the mortality rate is not high. The news is sensationalizing it and giving checkered fear-based information.

If you go to NYC Health you'll find the April 1st update and see a graph which shows the total breakdown, in sum:

NYC CV-19 Deaths: No underlying conditions = 14Underlying condition = 789

\*Meaning: If somebody has the disease when they die, but do not die from the disease, the gov still lists them as a CV-19 casualty, giving an inaccurate impression of the severity of the situation\* Weird that they do that.

Best to get information directly from doctors (twitter), medical institutes and be aware that in any crisis opportunistic types try to make a profit off of the scared population. Even if its just about selling a few more newspapers by hyping it all up. A lot of money is exchanging hands during these times and power are structures moving.

TrueQiGong,fj7n1sr,t1_f1q1r5m,1583093981.0,"Interesting, I was hoping qigong was deep and subtle enough to clear out trauma (I have CPSTD) as well as supernatural trauma exposure that is really hard to convey to most people (it might involve past-lives, I can't be sure tho!). I am currently in therapy and do have professionals I work with.

I've never heard of shengong, can you tell me a bit more about that? As in, how to discern a real teacher? And whether one would need to develop their qi gong practice more first?"
TrueQiGong,fj7gux4,t1_fei01ei,1583091451.0,"Why is Falun Gong considered a cult in qi gong? (serious question) Is it because they believe that their way is the only true way, and the others are not as good? Or is it is something in the style or use of deities, etc? 

I would not like to be in a cult, but understand the power of qi gong could easily become that unknowingly, as one progresses to higher levels."

BPDlovedones,fj506kx,t3_fbid51,1583021096.0,"She could have both. 

BPD in my understanding is often caused by trauma (very real, or percieved that way by the child at the time).

Someone told me qi gong was intentionally developed to help with things like that. It's too early for me to tell but have hope"
BPDlovedones,fj31rqv,t1_fj2onre,1582963009.0,That's what I concluded too.
BPDlovedones,fj31oqh,t3_fb4lwg,1582962894.0,"I think they are real, at that moment. There's just another half to them that subverts everything. But I don't think its all of them. They are first a being, second, a being affected by BPD. The good times were their beingness.  (Unless they were also narc or a sociopath then, I dunno, I doubt it was real.)

At least that's how I've processed my situation. And it's helped. The BPD is real too, that's why I have to stay NC."
CPTSD,fj31b8w,t1_fj2vmcf,1582962387.0,"I'm still looking for a good answer. Focusing full attention on breathing. Grabbing a pen and writing it out quickly which is what the Crappy Childhood Fairy does. Or sitting with the feeling and going to the bathroom to be alone and try to process the feeling using inner child retrieval and integration (taking that feeling to an imaginary safe land and letting it just be and rest..). 

Also, drinking coffee (not advised, I very much use it like smoking).. or hot water/tea, healthy snacks. Physical movement (flapping arms, tapping both sides of body (both hands) to help get both sides of the brain talking again)

Sorry I'm no expert. Hope this gives ideas to test out"
BPDlovedones,fj30yql,t1_fj2jzbt,1582961925.0,"It took me 7 months to start getting to a really good place where I wasn't always thinking about them and being so sad and broken.

Time. NC. Gym. Journaling. Writing. Trauma-based therapy. Nature. Artistic pursuits (for fun and healing), educational YouTube, comedies, stellar books....so many more options. I hope you find what works for you. I wrote a fiction book (draft) to take my mind off her. Whatever you enjoy doing, do it x100 to help pass the time while you pursue therapy and healing."
CPTSD,fj1szdi,t3_faxu8z,1582927087.0,"My therapist invited me to make up an imaginary home and land, just the way I want it, inside myself and whenever the really hard feelings come up, to sit with them and ask them questions, as if it was a piece of me, from the past stuck. It can get really physically painful. At some point, I ask the intense part of me if it wants to go to the safe magical land that only I control and is 100% fully protected at all times. Usually, it agrees and in this imaginary mind-place, the part goes and rests in special healing nature where it can let go and finally feel better. 

Its imaginary, but its real because its in my mind and actually creates an integrative experience for my lost parts and their feelings. 

I guess its a form of inner child self-led shamanic work. Childhood soul retrieval. I've even had mild panic attacks come on while im driving and then just walk myself through this and can feel the shift happening. Sometimes it takes 25 mins, other times 3 minutes. Tends to go quicker the more I do it. It's my go-to when I'm overwhelmed and really seems to work with lasting effects for severe onsets."
BPDlovedones,fj1mfon,t3_fawtvw,1582923124.0,"Don't do this alone if you don't have to. Line up a trauma-informed therapist who knows about BPD. If your insurance doesn't cover it, maybe there are some free counseling sessions in your area. 

You can still love them at a distance. In that way, you won't entirely ""lose"" them. But you'll be at a healthy distance, loving yourself as well. 

Best luck. And congratulations for doing what's best for your wellbeing"

Ramana Maharshi, the quiet sage on the ancient hill, is the only one that lived up to his actions, completely, that I found. And that simple comparison brought me out of the brainwashing. 

I know about Kumare! I've seen some clips and its been on my list to watch. Incredible really."
BPDlovedones,fipgdjm,t1_fip133a,1582606159.0,The stabilizing part you mentioned here I think is so key.

BPDlovedones,fioa45o,t1_fio5qk0,1582579255.0,"Spiritual bypassing. The most utilized tool by ""spiritually oriented"" to displace their own responsibility, or protect an abuser. ""You wouldn't be seeing it (this bad thing) if you didn't have it in you first!"" ""Match your vibration!"" ""La, la, la, there's no bad happening in the world if I don't believe it!"" 

I've thought a lot about this. My pwbpd was a monk, and so was I when we met. Although both very serious the teachings only helped so far until the psychology played itself out in real life, ultimately showing my co-dependency and CPTSD and her deep childhood wounds that formed BPD early in life.  Our teacher did not help this in fact. Worsened it by far due to his own delusions and proclamations of his elevated enlightened state. 

Going towards enlightenment both with our baggage, undealt with, did not work out. I'm dealing with it now in therapy. She returned to a different spiritual system, which I think she began in the first place, like me, as a type of therapy to deal with early traumas.

The enlightened awareness that transcends the mind may have no absolutes, separation or duality. It indeed may all be ""one"" and ""no-thing."" But the mind does not operate on that high level. It does have absolute evils and goods within it. These spiritual bypassing perspectives thrown out by know-it-alls is a mind claiming itself to be enlightened when it is still fully stuck in mind mud. 

Today I am easily repulsed by the hypocrisy of these new age bullshi\*t enlightenment types. I have a deep respect and love for wisdom. I look for it everywhere, though wasn't the best at discerning. Now, with some brutal experience behind me, I find more wisdom in an honest business person or farmer type than any spiritual head-spinner. 

Thank you for letting me rant on this perspective. I'm so appreciative when anyone calls out bulls\*t and abuse for what it is. Like the child pointing at a naked emperor."
BPDlovedones,fil2s1u,t1_fij0jvz,1582492426.0,"Specifically, I looked at the nervous system through the Chinese medicine approach and it started making more sense. I had complete ""qi"" or ""prana"" depletion post discard and all that trauma. No energy, a whirling mind caught up in what was left of my fried and frizzled out nervous system.. And no idea how to normalize it. I felt like I had stuck my finger in a light-socket and was completely spent. 

I tried to do Qi Gong, to clear and replenish my body. But 8 months ago that was too hard to sustain. I leaned on intensive trauma therapy instead and did inner child work soul retrieval until my energy came back into my body more. 

Also, I went to an acupuncturist, got nervous system supportive supplements and also began getting Network Care, which is a type of chiropractic that focuses specifically on the spinal cord. These are typically costly treatments that are not covered by insurance so I don't like to recommend them as much simply due to the prohibitive cost for some. My Network Spinal Analysis practitioner offered a sliding scale and some scholarships, so depending on your area you might be able to find the same resources. Network Care is a long term treatment to help remove trauma from the nervous system. It also incorporates breathing exercises. 

Other cheaper options, of course is qi gong, tai chi (which is free DIY, or low cost, best to find a serious practitioner who has cultivated ample energy). Breathing exercises specifically can help reset the nervous system and brain. Since I don't have much guidance on that I just do 3-minute concentration on my breathing, especially during the natural pause between each breath. Apparently this is a key integrative moment for the brain and body. 

There's a lot of different avenues out there to support your body/mind. It's taken a lot of time to explore what actually is the most effective, and so much more I don't yet know about. I also used subconscious reprogramming to help get my deep mind on board with the belief that I can actually heal my nervous system and recover fully from the BPD experience as well as earlier traumas.  

Hope something within this will inspire you to find something that works for you."

Yes, anything you can do that will make her want to break up with you...she'll think it's her idea. 

Rereading your post, if your life is in danger you need to prioritize that and go to the police. To protect yourself. Or start a relationship with them and figure out your options. Maybe they do have a mandatory hospitalization program for people who try to kill other people for instance?!"
BPDlovedones,ficscky,t3_f7eqxl,1582355888.0,"So sorry. These are some of the worst times. Line up a good trauma informed therapist who has gone through therapy themselves. Don't settle just for anyone, find a really good fit for you. 

You can still love her, always, but at a healthy distance. A new distance that allows you to have a more fulfilling loving life. You're losing your life with her, and that sounds like a good thing. You're not losing your love for her. You're gaining love for yourself."
BPDlovedones,ficrkgh,t1_fib6s3l,1582354996.0,"Therapy failed me too. Several times. I hated on it for 15 years. It was that bad. I tried again and went through 5 therapists, kept 2 because that both specialize in trauma but in different areas.

Life-changing for me. Please please don't let talk therapy idiots ruin your recovery options. There are talented  trauma-informed therapists out there, who have dealt with their own serious relationship issues and abuse themselves. Not just text-book learned but did it themselves. That makes a difference I find.

Maybe you could go on an interview spree and call up a slew of trauma educated therapists and question them first, test out some in a session until you find the right fit. They won't wave the wand and make your life perfect, but they can paddle down the river rapids with you and help navigate.

Anytime I found one that just nodded at me when I talked and then took my money without helping me with results or had the ability to relate during critical processing, I bailed out and never looked back. Best decision.

Please consider to keep searching until you find a gem who will support you in a transformational way."
BPDlovedones,ficpt0f,t3_f7oq19,1582353982.0,"Wow. I'm so sorry you're going through this. I hope you get some trauma therapy to help you through this, whenever you can. I don't have a real solution, just some thoughts that might help along the way

My ex also claimed suicide too, because ""I didn't love her enough."" I believed her that she might do it. It's so hard. What happened eventually is  that I went on a long trip and she felt abandoned by it, she cheated on me and devalued me and dumped me. It hurt so much but at least I didn't need to deal with her suicide threats anymore. 

Perhaps while you try to figure out how to best handle this (bring her to a DBT therapist or a trauma therapist?)  you can also ""greyrock"" her, by getting very boring, non-reactive, and let her lose interest in you, and she might line up another person to be with and dump you. That way you're free, by her own doing...."

Good on you for recognizing it. Trauma therapy might support this change. Also doing things to support the nervous system which endured all the conflict"
BPDlovedones,fic65v8,t1_fibl2hn,1582338587.0,"Woot! Glad to hear! lots of tools to pick up and play with that I would have never before if wasn't so busted. Subconscious reprogramming! I started qi gong to help with the mind body damage. Finally recovered enough to be able to go to classes regularly. That's kinda Jedi-ish too

My therapist identified how my early childhood interactions with my damaged parents was recreated (and worsened) with my ex. She focuses on that a lot now that some of the worst bits were addressed with EMDR. 

Also finding out that I had CPTSD before I ever met my ex helped loads. 

I wish you the best in your Jedi path that you're embarking on!"
BPDlovedones,fiarx8l,t3_f75hx1,1582307214.0,"The anger is normal. I was feeling TERRIBLE at around 5 months. and for more time after that... I still yell in my car sometimes and hit the seat to get the anger out. Many people say here healing is not linear and I think they're right. I do it less frequently now. Each time I see as an opportunity to release more. And behind that anger, for me, is a ton of grief and sadness. That I'm still dealing with even now. But the rest of my life is still greatly improving. 

More table punching! Actually ouch that seems like it would hurt. What about hitting pillows or throwing a ball into a wall, punching bag etc? These things are actually recommended by my trauma therapist. Getting mad 

So sorry to hear about this warrant you're facing, but so glad you had the mind to prepare your defense.  Does your routine include trauma therapy? That is completely key for me. Including things to help rebuild the nervous system after serious burnout."

I had no idea how to help my pwBPD, it's not something most therapists know or that the internet can provide one with. It's up to the pwBPD to take responsibility for themselves foremostly, that IS the way for improvement. No hand-holding can take them to the end of the line. We all have to take ourselves there, and yes it's sad and unfair that some have more trauma baggage to carry and deal with than others. But its no excuse. We all have our shot that's ours to take.

I love my ex pwPBD, I would give anything for them to get better fully, but until they come to the table, and take responsibility for themselves, I don't feel safe with them at all, or even interacting with them at this point. Our situations are very different of course.

I hope you strongly encourage this girl to pursue DBT and other serious trauma recovery programs. If she finds the right professionals, who really get it, it can greatly improve her life."

And d\*mn if they sense you're vulnerable and act like an assh\*le then, well you've just identified an assh\*le and who goes on your LC to NC list.

It hurts not to respond but I don't trust she's possibly any better. Also believe it's just a tragic romantic narrative in her head she wants to massage by more contact. Or wants to dismantle by villianizing me again so she can ""move on.""

No contact seems fool-proof. But it hurts bc I still care about her a great deal."

Why should I give her closure when she didn't give me the same. I shouldn't. I feel like maybe bc I handled it well and her life isn't working out the way she wanted that she's idealized me again and is looking for an opportunity to make me a villian again by pursuing communication."

But right now you need to deal with you first. I suggest you line up some trauma-informed therapist to help you through this time. Make sure they are trauma-informed! Not just talk therapy. Therapists can hurt, in my experience, if they are not well versed in some of the issues you are dealing with. Interview them first! Find a fit for you. Or/and listen to relationship therapists online to help soothe yourself, if that helps. Best wishes."
