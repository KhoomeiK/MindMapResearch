DecidingToBeBetter,fnep2im,t1_fnd1o3a,1586893319.0,I felt this way with many people and they all turned out to be pretty okay people. It's not much of an misunderstanding more of a I do not vibe with their actions and existence which is pretty harmless. I understand why they do the things they do and why the why they are. Thank you.
DecidingToBeBetter,fneo3w9,t1_fnd5g8f,1586892820.0,Thank you. I understand I just do not like their actions which are pretty harmless but dumb. I admit I do get jealous from the attention they get from doing stupid and I'm afraid that my other friends might join in and do stupid stuff.
DecidingToBeBetter,fnenkfb,t1_fne44uz,1586892546.0,Yeah I don't really like them because I don't like people who aren't willing to make a change for the better or just do stupid stuff and talk about it for attention. I can't really avoid them because they frequent my group chat and everytime I see them I just do not vibe with it. Also that book seems very interesting. Thank you

AskReddit,eumll93,t3_cgwyak,1563917307.0,I was super close to this one kid in the 3rd grade but I had to move at the end of the school year. We both didn't have phones or email so we couldn't contact another and lost touch. Fast forward to 6th grade and I was in afterschool and found out one of my classmates was friends with my old friend. I wasn't super socially aware and decided to write a heartfelt letter to him and tried to get the classmate to give it to him. My brother and the classmate had a convo before this on how apeshit I get when you piss me off so the classmate wanted to see me how I was like when I was going apeshit and tore the letter in half infront of me. I almost started crying and just hid my face for the rest of the day. Years later I'm still pissed
