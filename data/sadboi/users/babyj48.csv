I work in an ER here in Florida. It‚Äôs common for these memory care places to dump patients they no longer want to take care of in the Er. Might be a good idea to pick her up before they call 911 and have her dumped in the Er, and then say she isn‚Äôt allowed back. If you need suggestions for places in the central Florida area, as a paramedic I‚Äôve seen a lot of them. 

Also, in the meantime, google a place for mom. They can help with finding placement quickly. And if you explain your situation, they might take that specific care facility off their lists for other people. 


BBB might be a good contact too.
