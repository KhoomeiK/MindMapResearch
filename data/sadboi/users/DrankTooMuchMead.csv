The only plot exposition that has been fixed is at the very end when Jasper the Guru of Time used to say, ""someone you know needs your help. Find this person fast!""

Rap was something that was forced on all of us by peer pressure throughout the 90's and by high school I was outright rebelling against it. 

Rap wannabes were fucking clowns to us. They tended to take their appearance too far by wearing their hat wrong and their pants like they were falling off. Some black kids literally wore their pants down to cater to that culture.

You know the flat brimmed baseball caps? The flat brim style was made to cater to the wannabe crowd during my senior year. To this day, my friends and I refer to them as ""wannabe hats"".

You probably know that people can be addicted to pretty much anything. A narcissist is addicted to control, and nothing makes them feel more powerful than manipulating a person's emotions. 

For example, they will try to upset you in the workplace by lying to you and telling you strange things. But I don't respond in a predictable manner. I have been around a narc my entire life and have developed defense mechanisms for them. If I sense I am being manipulated emotionally, I might smile at them (without thinking) to let them know they can't control me. I had a guy, whom I had never met before, get in my face and yell that I should hate certain people. I just kind of shrugged and looked at him like he was stupid (unconciously). But narcs can't stand to have a person around they can't manipulate, so they will try to get me fired and spread lies before I even know there is a problem.

Everyone has the human mind, what some call the ego, and it is basically a second brain that we have to deal with. Humans kind of have two brains that are always fighting each other. Science has confirmed that the upper part of the brain, which is newer in evolution and is responsible for reasoning, is at odds with our lower, older, primitive part of the brain. The metaphor for the Angel on one shoulder and the devil on the other is perfect for this."

Have you read the flying spaghetti monster analogy? It's basically what you are saying."
pastlives,fqcv9la,t1_fqct3x5,1589270109.0,"God honest truth, I've developed a complex I'm struggling to get over that God hates me. I almost killed myself for real one time. I don't mean cut myself for attention, but standing there with a gun for a half hour and nearly doing it.

I had a really shitty childhood and the only reason I got through it was looking forward to adulthood and having a better life experience. But nothing ever went right, and at 27 I suddenly developed epilepsy for apparently no reason. That was 10 years ago.

Everywhere throughout my life I have been bullied. I'm a big guy, but that makes no difference. I'm a peaceful guy, and I guess bullying a big guy that wants peace makes people feel big. And I mean everywhere: a handicapped uncle, a narcissistic grandfather who I was handed over to at the age of 1, people at school as a kid, and complete strangers I don't know at work will target me. I'm a shit magnet.

I've talked to so many people who have just applied for work and became successful, without even going to school. Just show up at the right moment. Meanwhile, I will finish college, go back for more college for extra training, get a pile of certifications and volunteer hours, and apply to *that same position* that was so easy for others, and they won't even call me back after an interview. If I volunteer somewhere or become a temp in that field, the first thing I am told is that it is unlikely I would get the job because they have to offer the position to someone else first. In spite of that, any boomer is quick to roll their eyes at me and tell me, ""it's because you need to learn to start at the bottom. You need more gumption.""

I am on career attempt number 7. I finally decided to try a different career that I can market my degree to. I was in the process of that when the virus hit. Now its like I'm back in 2008 again. How long will I have to wait now? Another 10 years or more?

Sorry, I just had to vent. I was intending to give you an abstract. Maybe you can share with me, too.

Also, I've just recently been trying to get into something called manifestation, which is the idea that if you spend a lot of time imagining a good future, and imagining that it is true right now, that your subconscious will plug into the natural forces of the universe and make it come true. I guess I'm just really desperate. This spiritual idea also states that it can work in a bad way if you think negative all the time. As I said, there is no way my consistent bad luck could be coincidence."

It depends on the location and availability. There isn't just one thing that is the answer to all. Some people think nuclear is, but not every country has the budget for that. 

Also, why didn't OP mention solar?? Why is every nuclear energy fan so dismissive of solar energy?"
