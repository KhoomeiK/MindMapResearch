Divorce,fcs8qhq,t3_eim8zv,1577913035.0,"I feel your pain. It's been a tough journey so far but slowly I'm starting to feel stronger. Pain still cuts deep. I made a commitment for life, till death do us part. 
You threw me away like last week's garbage. Family shattered, you naively think kids will be just fine with a broken family. 
Maybe you did cheat and maybe you didn't. Fact is you walk away from us.

*** Recovery will be long for me. Hopefully, yours won't be. Stay strong. All the best to you and your kids."

Divorce,f8sbsus,t3_e1xj7t,1574776376.0,This will be my first Christmas to be alone as well. The anxiety is messing with my head.
Divorce,f8r5kzo,t1_f8nl2zr,1574732491.0,"Thanks.  She says that she's going to see a shrink to fix or help her heal herself.  She insist that I've inflicted a lot of pain on her. WTF, I've gone to work and home.  I've given her free reign to make decisions.  I dont drink, do drugs, beat on her or cheat on her.

Ladies....is there something wrong to be a guy that likes to be home?  I'm just a private guy that likes my alone time."
depression,f8pmen7,t3_e1dmmd,1574703843.0,Yes I feel it. Heavy feeling in your chest. Loss of appetite. Overall crappy feeling.
Divorce,f8n5lje,t1_f8mpafz,1574639354.0,We've got 2 young kids. I was torn because I tried to hang on. I could turn a blind eye anymore.
Divorce,f8lowpu,t3_e10y5k,1574624160.0,"  I'm in the same boat. Still going through it. My wife refuses to admit that she was having a physical or sexual affair with a mutual friend (was a friend). At the very least it's definitely an emotional affair. 

  She claims that he is just a friend and she looks up to him. This is the same guy I told her that wants to sleep with her and openly admitted this to me. She refused to believe me and continued this friendship. People at her work would tell me that they are inseparable. 

  I felt betrayed, he was a friend. In my eyes she chose him over me. She chose to maintain a friendship despite the fact that I told her of his interest. 

  She's asking for a divorce. I'm agreeing to it. There's just a lot if pain and hurt that surrounds the whole thing. In my heart I deserve better than the treatment I've received.

 Yah I feel your pain. Sorry for the rant."
