AskReddit,est2my8,t3_c8zwj2,1562261309.0,"This was many years ago. I was trying to get my then husband out of the house. He had been abusive and I was scared of him. He was to leave to Australia in 10 days and he was becoming more and more agitated. It was about 10 am - I had been working a late shift in the ER. I was lying on the couch watching tv before having to go back to work and he came in angry, telling me he was convinced I was breaking up with him. I told him I wasn‚Äôt. I offered to buy him some new stuff for his trip. He knew in his heart I was done and I couldn‚Äôt chill him out. He went after me and chased me into the bathroom. He pinned me against the wall and was choking me. I fought like hell and ran for the bedroom. He came after me pinned me on the bed. I felt the life leaving me and I knew I was gone. I saw my mom finding my body. I somehow managed to turn over and push him off. He just got more pissed. He ripped my ring off, broke some of my stuff and then he raped me. I just wanted out of there so bad because I knew I was going to die so I just got really calm and told him I was late for work. He took the keys to my car and told me he was taking my car. I just asked him if he would drive me. I got in the car with him, he was driving like a maniac. I remember looking out the window at the other people in cars. I felt so trapped. I was afraid at any moment he would just start beating me to death. He was screaming at me the entire drive.  I didn‚Äôt care about anything other than getting out of that car and away from him. Then he pulled over and I got out and he sped off. I went to my desk shaking and called my mom and told her what had happened. My step-dad and step-bother showed up at my house and put him on a plane to Australia that night. I just worked my shift and went home never to see him again."

I taught myself to speed read as a kid and I have two types of reading I do - narrator, where I‚Äôm listening to the poetry of the writing then mass absorption, where I am scanning the writing and gathering the information in a technical way.

When I think of a scene or a shot it plays exactly like the movie would, sound and all the images everything exactly like a movie playing in my head. If I had to define the physical location it plays, like where my focus is placed - it feels like it plays behind my eyes. It does not interfere with my vision, it is imaginary vision. I can see both at the same time."
