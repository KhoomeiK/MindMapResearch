Challenge yourself, this may be tough, scary, and overwhelming.  Do a little a day.  At night reflect on the good and the bad, and push yourself the next day and then the next.

They were scared and I made the decision to seek treatment when I couldn't function any longer and I was starving myself on purpose.  You are worth living, very few people will fully understand this and want to help in anyway.  You need to keep active in some way to distract yourself from your past actions, and find someone you trust that you can share all the bad with.

If you regret what you did that is a good step.  Im hear to listen.  You just have to find your trigger warning that makes you feel like hurting yourself.  If your up for the challenge.

Not once did you say that you were thinking about hurting yourself, I am happy for this.  You care enough that you see yourself growing older and old.   Fantastic!!

People are very strange and yes hard to talk to, especially introverts like myself.  I dive into the darkness to find the good, and yes this is scary for a person to do, but it's just how I formed my life.  To me you sound that you want to just talk and for us to just listen.  I am fine with this.  Message me if you have suicidal thoughts where you are planning to hurt yourself.  This is one area of your thought process that I don't want you to be in.

After months of trials with medication, I am on zyprexa which is making me stable, but I am not a fan of, I wish I was taking Risperidone again.  The talking needs to happen organically, maybe a therapist is not the person, but he has to find a person to hear him out. 

The problem right now is that he has not hit rock bottom, meaning that he has you as a main support person.  My concern is that this is a lot for you to handle.  Do you feel that you may benefit from getting an emotional support buddy?  If he is starting to not eat balanced meals, he has begun to see, hear, Have disorganized thought, and his higiene is poor, then I would say it would be best if you would make the decision for him.  I understand this is a fine line, but it would be best for the both of you.

Lived in the same neighborhood and went to the community College.  Failed, semester after semester.  I moved back to my parents house where I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety, taking medication, have been hospitalized once, finished a program at the local community College.

You will have days of isolation, but if you need message me to just complain about everything and anything.  Heck if you want to hear about my struggles than I'm happy to share.

Been having some insomnia lately, you are not alone."
mentalhealth,ezsjrfu,t3_d239b7,1568094305.0,I know the feeling.  I was hit with a huge bill when I was put in the hospital.  The only best thing is seeking financial help before leaving the hospital.  It wasn't easy for me since I was not in the best frame of mind at the time.
SBSK,ezsdogs,t3_d228ic,1568088149.0,Thank you for sharing.  I am sad that we have to separate the community with different social platforms.  I do not check all the media platforms to read everyones comments.
SBSK,ezrp75b,t3_d1z961,1568076905.0,"Daniel, I know your pain.  I suffer from Depression, anxiety, and voluntarily, involuntarily submitted myself into the hospital about 5 years ago.  I am socially ackward, I can go throughout the day stationed in a silent room (not healthy at all) and my thoughts run a million times a second while my speech is like an old man, slow.  You are very lucky to have been married because I'm in my 30's and have never been on a date that we both agreed on.  My thoughts look towards the negative and I have a bad habit of trying to read body language.  I know the feeling of not being a talkative person, my past shows that when I have too much anxiety, I want to stay silent and not reach out to anyone.  You are doing well with a support group right behind you.  Stay focused and push your self to explore a little more out of your comfort zone and I as well.

Too bad comments are blocked on YouTube as their should be a main social board where all comments from the community are posted.  I'm thinking of a program one can make.

Thank you Daniel for sharing your world."
