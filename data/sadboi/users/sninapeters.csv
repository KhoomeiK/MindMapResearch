My work is remaining open and we have over 150 employees. I don’t understand if we cannot congregate in groups larger than 10, how is it ok that my work (a collection agency) is allowing us all to sit 2 feet away from each other? Half of us are coughing and obviously sick. Also Boeing is staying open even though it’s had CONFIRMED 20+ cases of COVID. We are scared of contracting this Illness but also that we will lose our homes without employment. 

After the governor addressed us this afternoon it seems very clear that they care mostly about the economy and are not taking the necessary strides to contain this virus. 

My work told us we won’t get sick, because we’re around each other every day and exposed to the same germs, therefore we are fine. Somehow they’re giving us medical advice. I work with MANY high risk people including the elderly. Who can I contact about this? Im tired of the government only addressing how this effects our economy and people are dying."
