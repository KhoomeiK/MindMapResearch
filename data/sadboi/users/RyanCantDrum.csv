bahai,fp8ttmu,t1_fp8pxvd,1588402769.0,"To go more over - as I am a ""lazy"" or ""inactive"" bahai, ex. I smoke, drink, and dont follow the rules - I've had lots of friends I've talked to who were ""Christian"" or essentially not religious year round till Christmas comment that **""The Baha'i' faith sounds so great, it's just what the world needs. Sign me up. Wow is this an actual religion?"" etc etc.**

I want to preface my cautionary advice to you with this as well: I am not trashing the bahai faith, and I hope this comment isn't interpreted as such. Also the assumptions I make of ""Baha'i's"" are made that **when I refer to Baha'i's I am speaking idealistically**. There are plenty of Baha'i's like me - although we believe we shouldn't criticize or police others behavior as Baha'i's. Again, ideally. 

But to go back to your question: to Baha'is (and most Abrahamic religions as a whole) marriage, chastity and intimacy are complex and profound topics. Even subjects such as personal higeine and who you choose to be friends with, and associate with are regarded are not simple choices in the eyes of Baha'is.

>So, what happens if I break a rule? Also if I want to get married, wouldn't it be unjust to make marriage a condition based upon gender, a trait which isn't chosen? Especially if someone only finds love with someone of the same gender? If so, which side is correct?

To give context to our religion, my example above with marriage, and your questions regarding marriage and gender I'm going to paraphrase my knowledge of some of our writings.

Baha'i's believe men and women are different, and serve different but **equally important roles** in the development of children - which I also think is encouraged to have by Baha'i's. An example that really took me back when I was a junior youth was something a bahai told me in passing - regardless if it is true or not my point of Baha'i's accepting the differences between the two genders, is believed.

If a family with a son and daughter only have enough money to send one of their children to school, it is encouraged to send their daughter. That way when she is a mother, the first teacher, and ultimate nurturer, she can teach her own children easier than say, her mother who has been put in this difficult dilemma.

*For Any Baha'i's who have read this far: is the above paragraph accurate?*

Lastly as I have failed to make it clear within my comment: While the bahai faith is an amazing religion, has predicted even scientifically proven practices, **it is very much a traditional religion.** We are different in many regards, as we have little authorities (no priests, popes, clergy/power struggles) - at the same time there are lots of beliefs and ideas that are incredibly old that are reinforced. It is also worth noting that around 80% - 70% of what our prophet and other significant figures have written **has not even been published.** Baha'i's believe religion are meant for their place and time - approx 1000 years each, and our story has just begun. Our understanding of our world and faith unravels by each of our steps, and long after our death. 

If anything at all, I think what most people should do is read the writings. There resides the uncorrupted word of God, and what I found to be the most enlightening. If they are daunting at first, you can attend Baha'i events such as deepenings or study circles which are basically you with a group of people reflecting and contemplating the meaning of some of the writings.

As I was raised Baha'i, the faith has had an instrumental change on my character - so much so I've even receive comments on it to this day. Even if you can't commit to practice the faith, it's much larger than other religions which have a set of laws saying  ""do x - go to heaven."" The applications of the writings are from everything to motherhood, to finding purpose, finding meaning, doing better work in your life, how to behave with others in tribulations, etc."

My point is, is that even with more than a modicum of skepticism, as I am very skeptical and analytical - if the indirect proofs/ truths that influence the probability of the truth you are looking for are not in your favor, then why hold such an opinion?

One thing I think that could be tried to negate campers who grind evo shields by poking cross map is implementing a slow slow decrease over time to shield strength for evo shields. Not saying this will work, but it would mean that the campers would ultimately have to keep repositioning to gain sights on their target, and ultimately come closer.

Its worth a try. Sadly I think that a lot of the BR genre is plain experimentation, with the users being the victims ultimately. For example, fortnite is still in beta. Game production has changed from shipping a finished game - tossing a turd out the door and hope a flower blooms. Games are now focused around updates and patches - which is jarring considering how much of the game I appreciated that was balanced at launch.
