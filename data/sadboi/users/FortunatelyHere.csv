relationship_advice,fqxi8ss,t3_gkxhym,1589732698.0,"I recommend that you read about New Relationship Energy. Every relationship has patterns like this, where you get comfortable. To insert new energy in the relationship, you have to be deliberate about it. In a long term relationship, you have to commit to choosing the other person, and staying together through some peaks and valleys. Most people in a long term relationship will tell you that they've ""fallen out of love"" with their partner for some of that time. Also, recognize that distance relationships are difficult. 

On the other hand, you should be very deliberate about WHO you choose to commit to long term. Nobody can tell you if you'll be happy with him long term. You have to decide, is it worth it to wade through the not-so-fun times in the relationship for a potential of something better later? 

I recommend you do have a serious talk with him about the relationship, hopes for the future, idea of a satisfying relationship, etc.. One thing to try is to use the Love Languages model to guide this conversation. Do the quiz and talk about your results together. Talk about how you can make each other feel loved while you're apart and how to use your time together to best benefit the relationship.

Good luck!"

Certain children have big personalities and needs and can be very destructive. It does take over all the space and focus of a family in a very invasive way. In that case, there is every expectation that the child will learn and grow. You teach the child new skills, you limit the child's access to certain things, you insist they pick up or take away toys, etc. And parents have to work out a division of responsibilities for caring for the child and cleaning up after their destruction. 

In your case, your wife is behaving like a toddler but she has all the access of an adult in the household and feels the right to refuse interventions or responsibility for her actions. I feel compassion for her, the same that I would feel compassion for a child. But it can't be allowed to continue without improvement and responsibility."

She probably doesn't realize how aggressive and invasive her behaviors are. She's asserting the right to control every room in the house to the point that the space is not usable to you--that goes way beyond being messy. You want to be able to sit at a table and eat, to go to a bed and sleep, to look in your drawers and find the clothes you put there. She is taking away your right to basic functionality in your own household.

If she refuses to change or get help (this does sound obsessive/compulsive or something) it is reasonable to declare that it is time for a separation. It may be that if you issue an ultimatum, she may finally decide to get help.

One lesson to learn from this, for future reference: Set terms FIRST. If someone lives with you, visits you, goes on vacation with you, etc (especially your ridiculous sister or parents) discuss terms first and come to an agreement. If they don't agree to terms, the arrangement does not happen. In some cases (like a joint vacation) you might be on equal terms in the negotiation. However, when it is your own house, you get to set ALL the terms and can turn your sister (or anyone else) away from living with you unless they agree to your terms and behave in a way that is acceptable.  

It sounds like your parents and sister have a long ways to go in making up for a lot of bullshit you've taken over the years. If they want to be on good terms with you, it is up to them to change their behavior.

relationship_advice,fo0cexm,t3_g4ws1j,1587410255.0,"If you're going to get anywhere with your husband, the first thing you have to do is validate his concerns.

I would agree with your husband that the goal in raising a kid is for them to become a strong, independent, well-rounded, capable adult. 

The absolute cut off at age 18 is the problem. It is arbitrary and has no basis in reality--especially in a down economy. And a gradual transition to independence makes a lot more sense. People who have no parental support after high school DO sometimes become motivated. However, they also have a lot of barriers to their long term success, especially barriers to going to college. And they are less likely to have good relationships with their parents.

I have to say, I think your approach is too extreme as well. The idea of ""when he's ready"" is too loose. That approach could very well lead to the things your husband fears. You need something in the middle. Something that will require your son to be gaining independence and skills with support and love. One example--if your son doesn't know what he wants to do, how is he going to figure that out? He needs some concrete steps for how he's going to explore options and try things out.

In my opinion, the idea of what counts as ""high maintenance"" is irrelevant. What is relevant is that you're living within your means. Your husband seems to think that anything above a lower middle class life is ""snobby."" He's placing a value judgment on having and spending money, even to make your life happier and more fulfilling. If he can't change this value judgment about this, the marriage probably isn't going to work out. 

Bottom line: don't let this guy control your life anymore. Live your best life! Congrats on building such a great career and life for yourself."

You're uncomfortable in a dirty environment and he's uncomfortable in a clean environment. He'd have to agree to some major changes in the way he lives his daily life and you'd have to be more tolerant. Also, you would end up cleaning up after him all the time, which is a bad dynamic for partners who are supposed to be equals. Are you happy to stay in a relationship when you may never live together? 

As for spending the summer with his family--I would say that's a definite no. I'm not as clean as you but I couldn't handle even a week in that beach house. Maybe you could agree to go for just a few days or something?"

OP, maybe the best approach is to tell your friends that you're going to be okay and ""moving on"" is not some magical thing that will make everything better. And your lack of ""moving on"" is not an indication that your grief is worse or your mental state is worse. Tell your friends that you appreciate their concern and support but bring this up is not helpful.

This is how you need to approach it. Tell your fiance that this is not what you signed up for and this is not at all the way you want to live. When two people live together as equals, both have to give approval for anyone else to stay overnight at ALL, even more so for someone else to move in. 

Tell fiance that his mother has to leave by the time your sister comes in March. The guest room is not MIL's room. Ask him if he wants to tell her of if you should, but it is on the calendar, it has been the plan for a while, and MIL can't just supplant your guest. Or your baby, of course.

I have learned that I need to be more flexible and more child-centric in my approach. And no, that does not mean my child rules the house or has no discipline. So, I want to validate your analysis of the parenting situation--your wife needs to learn to be less rigid and give up some of her prior expectations in order to be a parent to this particular kid. If she's not willing to do so, she isn't really ready to be a parent. :(  I consider it my job to become the parent that my kid needs.

If you haven't already, look into attachment disorders. And, I am horrified at the thought of a child with attachment issues being abandoned by his mother.

And, I agree with others. Please tell your daughter so it isn't a secret. There are some fabulous children's books about adoption.

Of course you'll have some emotional loss and a change in your daily patterns of behavior. But at the same time, you'll have the freedom from her ridiculous rules. Embrace that! 

School: Get yourself some study groups for school. It will give you accountability for keeping up with school and maybe will even lead to some friends who do non-school stuff together. And make it a priority to at least go to class, even if you aren't keeping up with all the work. It will keep you from getting too far out of the loop.

That feeling of disconnection you'll get when you break up with your girlfriend is a normal human reaction. But it does not, at all, mean that you should still be with her.

You said you feel stuck--it can be hard to make such a big change. And it is really hard to feel lonely and friendless. But you can get through it and in the end, you'll be happier.

However, I will say, if you are on a good career path, some of it could get better. You might be able to move into a more rewarding and interesting job. You might qualify for more vacation time (I get 25 days of leave per year, plus sick days). Or, some people move into consulting (or some other business) later in their career, once they have built up more skills and experience, and can charge enough money for their services that they can work less than 40 hours per week, or work in spurts and then have enough money to have time off in between jobs.

Ummm...she doesn't have to coparent with him. You and your wife are his parents. This dude is not a parent. Look up other stories of open adoptions. It generally isn't like co-parenting. And this is even more treacherous because of the history.

\> I’m supposed to invite this man back into my sons life

Nope, not required. It is much more important to consider the kid. Why would it be better for the kid to have to deal with this? Your wife is being so selfish here. Please work with the counselor and advocate for a better way to handle all this, with your son as #1 priority.

\> My wife is leaving tomorrow to spend the weekend with him at his house to what she says is to figure out her feelings.

She's communicating SO clearly that she has no intention of being loyal to you. She's having an affair and acting like you're mean because you object to the affair. If she acts like something else is going on, you talk straight about it and put everything out in the open. Let her know that this weekend is an act of infidelity and any other interpretation is bullshit.

\> I’m the only one having a hard time with this, and he’s so much easier to deal with,

Of course bio dad loves all this. He gets what he wants and none of the hard work or responsibility. You're the one having a hard time because 1)they are both treating you like shit and 2)you're the one who is actually thinking about the best interests of the child.

\>  now says she regrets it because she made the decision based on our kids and not on her feelings and now she wants to make decisions for herself.

I mean, I can sympathize with this. I am a mother and I probably sacrificed too much of myself for the sake of my children. But once you're a parent, you have to take responsibility for being a parent. You can't excuse every selfish thing you want to do and pretend like the negative consequences of your selfish actions are not your fault. If you want to live an independent life and put your feelings and desires above everything else, don't have children. And don't plan to have long-term relationships.

I don't see how you could ever have a trusting relationship with this person, ever again, even if she decides to end this affair and come back to you. It must be heartbreaking but you can make it through this. She won't be looking out for the best interest of the kids so someone has to. Be the responsible one. Note: being responsible doesn't mean staying in a terrible relationship and allowing yourself to be mistreated.

1) If people want to come, insist on specific dates, both start and end. If it is getting close and they haven't committed, tell them the invitation will soon expire--I need to be able to make my own plans

2) If someone wants to stay longer than I intended, immediately correct the misconception. When they say they plan to stay 8 days, say, I'm sorry, you may have misunderstood our invitation and that plan doesn't work for us. How about these 3 days?

3) If someone does something rude in my house, immediately interject. It is okay to ask someone to be more respectful in my own home, to clean up their own messes, etc.

In general, have better communication--more specific and sooner, rather than waiting for things to get bad. Don't be afraid to have the difficult conversation.

Never live with someone without making a solid plan, in writing, about who pays for what, how house work is split, rules for how you share space, etc.

You'll likely learn some more important information about how he views your relationship. And then you have a choice to make. 

Does this guy even think he is your boyfriend? My guess is that maybe he doesn't. Do some serious thinking about what you'd like in a relationship and look for that in a next relationship.

This is the key here. This is what brings you together in the discussion. You both want her to be happy. From that shared idea, you have acknowledgment that something has to change. You're probably not going to get very far on the chore front until you address this. She's not happy and she's not doing very much...she needs help and support to become a fully-functioning, happy adult again. It is probably best if you aren't her only source of support. She probably needs to be less isolated. And you could use some extra support as well.

So that's an issue you need to work out with your husband as well--if he doesn't eat veggies, that's going to teach your kids they can also refuse the whole food group. 

I would probably let him pick once per week a meal that he wants and make it for him, in addition to some extra vegetables you can add to the meal. I also like to have some meals where people make their own plate--taco salad, baked potato bar, hawaiian haystacks, etc. You can put plenty of veggies on the table and serve your kids veggies but it stays separate. Beyond that, make what you want. Let him cook on days when he has time--plan with him ahead of time so you can coordinate which days and for grocery shopping.

Note, I don't think you have any kind of obligation to make these accommodations...I would hope he's doing things to take care of you, and take into account your preferences, and make you feel special, too. If he's not, that's a whole different conversation."

I don't think you should share a dog if you don't share a household. I think it is likely because of the shared dog and your girlfriend is acting more like it is a shared household.

relationship_advice,f3grg6a,t3_dgy45q,1570914442.0,"I want to share my perspective as a mother. I was a SAHM for several years and I've also had a more typical full time job for several years as a mother.

First, time at home with a toddler is way more exhausting than any job I have ever had. It is physically and emotionally draining. At the same time, it is not mentally very stimulating. So it has moments of satisfaction but many hours that are not very satisfying. And of course, so much depends on the child. Some kids are higher need than others.

You're coming from a perspective of ""what is fair?"" In general, when I am a SAHM, I think that taking care of a CHILD (not the house) is my job while my DH is at work. When he is home evenings and weekends, we are then equal. As in, we both should do some work and childcare, we both should have a chance to get a break if possible, we should share night child caring duties (if there are any) so that there isn't one of us who is constantly missing sleep. For dividing up work, I recommend the technique in ""His Needs, Her Needs"" to list all the jobs and divide them up, generally assigning jobs to whoever thinks the job most needs to be done. You may find it doesn't all actually need to be done, or not as frequently.

However, I think you need to think more than ""what is fair?"" I think you also need to be thinking about mental health and satisfaction in life. If your wife is acting like this, she could have a mental health problem. Or possibly, she's just bored and unmotivated by her life and needs something more stimulating. Or, it could be that writing brings her stimulation and satisfaction and is the only thing keeping her happy and that's why she's not doing housework. Or she could have ADD that interferes with getting things done. Instead of bugging her to do more, ask her if she's happy. Talk about what you both want for your life now, where you want to be in 5 years, etc. How's she feeling about this plan from several years ago to quit and start a business? How are things going with caring for the toddler and blogging? Does she need more social contact with adults, through a parent group or something? Would she be happier with a part-time job? Is she bothered by the messy house? Is she actually expecting you to do all the stuff that gets piled up when she doesn't do it? Or maybe there's something else going on in her head.

I hear resentment in your writing. I have been there, and for the exact same thing--feeling like I was doing all the work. Resentment is poison and it doesn't get you anywhere. It is healthier to try to support your partner and ask for support in return. Your needs are valid and what you describe is not sustainable long term. Please do something to advocate for yourself, of course. But it could take a very different shape than you demanding your wife do more chores."

For a couple who has been together for such a short time, I think you are giving too much of your time and your life to help him out. And it sounds like he isn't giving that much in return.

Tell him that you both moved into the relationship (and especially living together) too quickly and it turns out that you aren't really compatible and now you want out. You can consider yourself broken up right away. I think that 8 weeks to stay living there is very generous, considering the short time he's been living there--if he's not on the lease, you could give him less and still not be a jerk in my eyes.

[https://www.wgu.edu/online-teaching-degrees/elementary-education-teacher-certification-program.html](https://www.wgu.edu/online-teaching-degrees/elementary-education-teacher-certification-program.html) I also think that you could go to another state and they would help you make arrangements for certification in MD but that has obvious downsides. 

Community colleges do frequently hire adjunct instructors who have masters degrees. However, it is less common for a full time job. Also, it will depend on how much competition there is in your field. Is there a glut of people wanting full time history teaching jobs? If so, you will have a hard time competing with those who have PhDs. Full time teaching positions in universities and colleges are pretty scarce and high competition in general. Part time is a much different story.

I find that it is surprisingly difficult to straddle the teaching profession across K-12 and higher ed because they have different requirements. Plenty of people do both but I think they often have to get another degree to switch from one to the other."

relationship_advice,f0ac81z,t3_d4cdjz,1568513032.0,"First of all, I'm so sorry that you're in this situation. I've had PPD and it was awful. Lack of sleep was a huge factor for me. Human brains cannot function without sleep. I agree with others who say you should see a doctor right away. You could also talk to your pediatrician about maybe stretching out time between feedings to be every 2-3 hours instead of every 1-2 hours. And I'm not a fan of cry-it-out but you can do other things to sleep train your baby to sleep a little longer, even if it isn't all night long. I'm a big fan of breast feeding but I used nursing as a solution too quickly with my first baby--sometimes the problem is something else, not hunger. 

It sounds like your husband is overwhelmed by the situation and is dealing with it by retreating and ignoring the problem. You may be in a cycle where the harder you push the issue, the further he retreats. You may need a couples therapist to help you get out of this. Give him space to talk about it in a setting with no accusations. Ask him what he thinks about becoming a parent and what kinds of things he wants to do as a parent. You may find he feels helpless with a baby so little. I'm not excusing this attitude but you can't address it unless he'll admit it.

I think you both need more support. I think it is okay for him to spend time with friends every day. It just needs to be equal. If he can leave the house for hours with no baby, so can you. Anything he does that isn't work counts. Start with an hour every day, just leave the house and go somewhere.On a weekend (or some time when he's not working--I don't know if he has a traditional work week), I would even suggest that you spend a night (or a day) away at a hotel. Let the baby learn to take a bottle if she doesn't already. Get some sleep and he can learn what it is like to be a parent. He'll soon understand that taking care of a baby doesn't mean you have ""all day to sleep."" 

Also, I hope that he has friends who are also fathers. If he isn't hanging out with fathers, I suggest that he find someone to talk with who has been through this. 

And even more, you need support. You need more than what your husband can give you. Do you have a best friend or female relative or anything, someone who could come take care of you for a few days? Do you have friends to hang out with? Do you know other moms who could provide social and physical support for you?

Please remember, this first year is really hard and it will get better. Everything will get better--your mental state, your relationship, your perspective about the future. I don't think that anyone should make major life changes during that first year."
UMD,f07v649,t3_d40jln,1568469553.0,"A few places:

Prince George's Plaza mall. There's a shuttle that goes there from campus--the one that goes to the PG metro stop. I tend to go to Old Navy and JC Penney first but there are plenty of stores there that would have hoodies. There's also a Target there.

Speaking of Target, you can order stuff from Target's website and have it shipped to the Target Express on Baltimore Ave for pick up--that way you don't have to pay for shipping and you hardly have to leave campus.

Beltway Plaza mall. You could take the C2 there--not sure about UMD shuttle options. There's a Burlington, a Marshall's, another Target, and a few more clothing stores.

Value Village--the thrift store. Everything will here will cost 1/4 to 1/2 as much as the other stores because it is used. There are several in the area but I find the best selection at the one on New Hampshire Avenue in Silver Spring. Looks like you could take the C8 to get there (again, not sure about UMD shuttle options). Or, there's one on University Blvd that is much closer.

An added note: it sounds like you might be new to living in a cold climate? If so, please realize that you are going to need a lot more than just a hoodie in a few months. You will need several sweatshirts, a coat, and a hat at the very least. And gloves. I like to have wool socks and thermal underwear (just the bottoms) if I'm going to be walking around outside a bunch in January.  If you need a whole winter wardrobe, I recommend Value Village, for sure, unless you're rich. In any case, a hoodie is a good start! You won't need all of that for a while and the stores will have more winter gear in stock later."
instructionaldesign,ez0plhn,t3_czdsfq,1567640166.0,"Final thoughts: 

I know you feel trapped but it sounds like you are largely painting yourself into a corner, mentally. We've given you a lot of ideas to try. Try some of them! 

I don't think you should try for another program--I think you should finish this one. You don't need to apply for a position to do your project. 

Stop worrying so much about the apparent value of your degree program and just try to finish it. A degree + some skills will get you a job. Your demonstrable skills are going to be more important than the name of the school on your resume. 

Group projects are fabulous to put on a portfolio--I've got lots. You could always explain what parts of the project you contributed. You can add description of the instructional design principles involved in the project--that way you are demonstrating your understanding and application of those principles. The part you write to go along with it (even if it is just a paragraph or two) is all yours and helps demonstrate your skills. Also, if you don't have anything you built yourself, build something. Come up with your own idea, sign up for a trial version of some software, act as your own SME or use existing materials to adapt to another format. A portfolio is going to be the most important thing to getting a job. If all you see are obstacles and you discount all the solutions...I can't see you operating very well as an ID. You need to learn to problem solve and remove barriers. You need to think creatively. Making your portfolio will help you show yourself you can do these things.  I recommend the podcast dear instructional designer--there are several (5?) episodes about portfolio building. 

Good luck! Don't let your discouragement stop you from becoming an ID if that is what you want."
instructionaldesign,eyy603e,t1_eyy1mq5,1567572597.0,"You don't need a volunteer position. You just need to find a contact within the organization who will support the project. They will be your contact person and perhaps your SME as well. The incentive is that they have a business need that you can address, for free. However, if they are a place that takes interns, you could consider trying to get set up as an intern. If not, you would draft a contract of sorts and talk about how long the project will last, how often/how many times you meet with them, what resources and access they can share with you, etc.

I conducted a number of in-depth interviews for various assignments in my graduate program. In most of them, I mentioned that I would be in need of a project for xyz course soon (I had to find projects for a bunch of my courses). They weren't interviews with IDs, in my case. They were people (in higher ed, in government) who were involved in various ways in projects that interested me. I chose them for interviews because I wanted to know more about what kind of work they were doing because it would shape my own ID perspective. In a couple of cases I had a connection (someone I knew from previous jobs) who referred me. For one, I just called some numbers at the local community college  (I found the first numbers online and was sent on a chain of referrals), trying to find out more about the decision making for their online offerings. 

You could also start from informational interviews. Pick someone who has the job you want. Say that you're graduating soon and are learning more about the job market. Ask the normal questions for an informational interview and also ask them for advice for job searching and for finding a project you could do for free. If you have an idea of what direction you want to go when you graduate or what kind of ID work appeals to you, that helps. During the course of an interview, I would sometimes identify a pain point myself--something in their work that could possibly be addressed with instruction.

For a local non profit just call them up and ask who is in charge of volunteers. Then, tell them you are interested in hearing more about how they handle training and can you ask a few questions? After you learn a little bit, you might be able to see an area of need or ask if you don't see it--what isn't going very well?

1) Anywhere you work, you should be able to find some need for instruction. I find it surprising that you've gotten so far in your program and you don't see opportunities all over the place. If you're leaving a position, is there a need for documentation with your job? Make a recording to show someone how to do your job after you've left?

2) See if you can make arrangements to continue your current project remotely, maybe? Lots of ID work is done by contract and remotely. Revise things so that you work with a main point person in the organization after you leave, gather a lot of your needed resources before you leave, etc.

3) You may need a new advisor."
instructionaldesign,eyxu5ae,t3_czdsfq,1567562606.0,"You don't need an ID job to do an ID project. You just need to have a relationship with some business or organization that has a problem that can be solved with instruction.  If you're moving to a new place, you could consider offering your services to a local government agency, a community college, or non profit. For example, I know that both animal shelters and local libraries rely on help from volunteers. Find the person who manages the volunteers and ask if you could revamp their volunteer training. 

Have you been well trained in evaluation and assessment in your program? I find that many organizations are in need of people who have those skills. During my grad program, I conducted an evaluation of faculty development needs for a university--a specific program that had only been running for 5 years and didn't have enough standard protocols. We did some interviews, wrote and administered a survey to all faculty,  analyzed the data, and reported our findings and recommendations. It was a great project and I bet a lot of organizations could use a similar evaluation. It may involve some cold calls or heavy use of linkedin connections...but most people are thrilled to have free work done for them."
