Drugs,fjwov8n,t1_fjv7nke,1583642204.0,"Whenever i want a prescription for adderall or a comparable stim i tell the doc i had a hard time focusing in elementary school, lots of parent teacher conferences saying i needed to be tested for adhd, mom didnt want to medicate, etc, and that at work, my boss often remarks that I'm not ""on"" 

Well that's actually all true, i was diagnosed with adhd at 23 and getting a prescription for it helps sooo much dude. Also I'm female, adhd presents itself differently in girls vs boys. So that could be a diagnosis you could explore if motivation and focus is something you struggle with. Adhd is mostly internalized with girls. I reeeally really have a tough time motivating without my meds. Like I'll put off shit i have to do until i get my prescription refilled. Def a lil dependent :)

Also urge surfing (it's a skill i use for drug cravings) notice the urge to self harm within your body. See it, envision it, feel it - it is real and it is a part of you, but you don't have to let it control you. Give it space within your body so it doesnt over take you. imagine your urge as a painful black cloud within your body, give it 1 centimeter of physical space in your body, like a protective barrier, so it doesnt touch anything else. When the urge gets stronger and bigger, dont try to stifle it and control it and regulate it, just allow your centimeter of space to grow with it. The worst urges usually don't even last for more than 5 minutes at a time, and rarely even that long without some subsiding. Watch, and allow your urge to wax and wane, to wash over you, literally let it happen, and it will suck, but you know what is right for you, and indulging is not. It was really hard the first time I tried it, and kind of weird, but it helps dude

jackrussellterrier,f2ewjtr,t3_dd1b0f,1570205313.0,"It's all a out finding what reward they respond best to- toys, pets, or treats

When I rescued my jrt mix, the shelter provided discounted training which I took advantage of.

Here is a simplified version of what I learned:
1. Establish a ""bridge"". A bridge let's your dog know that they have successfully completed a task and will receive a reward asap. It ""bridges"" the gap between command and reward. You can use a clicker or a vocal command. I use ""YES!"" With mine bc I didnt want to deal with another item I would have to hold. Start by using the bridge without a command. With mine, I began by saying YES and tossing her a single piece of kibble about 20 times a day. Every time I said YES, she would know she was getting a treat. 

2. Start training with small things like sit. I would hold the kibble above her head and move it backwards so she would look up, and ideally her hindquarters will go down. Use the bridge the ABSOLUTE SECOND her butt hits the ground. Then she knows she is getting a treat. Eventually you will be able to get her to sit without manipulating the treat over the head, because she knows that when she moves into that position  after the command, she will receive the treat.

3. Down is an easy one too. Say down, and move your hand with the treat to the ground. Head will follow and ideally the rest of the body. The second the dog hits the position you want, use the bridge and reward with a treat

4. I have a problem with the more advanced tricks though, and its partially my fault. My dog is very very reward oriented and she wants her treat by doing the least possible work. For example, I've taught her bang. I point my finger guns and yell bang and she rolls over on her back. And she immediately jumps back up. But I want her to stay on her back a bit longer for a better effect, so I withhold using my bridge until I am satisfied with her performance. But now she will respond to my inhale before saying yes and breaks her pose before I say yes. So when she successfully does something more challenging and I get excited she's finally got it, I have to really watch breath. I imagine with a clicker it would be the same as moving your hand to click it.

Message me if you have any other questions. I love training my dog!"

AskMen,exw9pn8,t1_extwniu,1566616057.0,"I admit I can get a bit derailed and often tell these drawn out stories, 90% of which is unnecessary detail. Now my boyfriend just asks ""is this going to be a woman's story?"" And it reminds me to keep it   weed out my random passing thoughts lol"
ArtCrit,exw8m36,t1_exw8ks1,1566615465.0,By background I mean blue :)
ArtCrit,exw8ks1,t3_culaxv,1566615443.0,"Honestly I like it just how it is. Personally wouldn't change anything but if you're just itching to add something..  notice how all those lines overlap and create their own little shapes within the piece? Idk maybe you could pick a few amd outline them, maybe with the background color"
ArtCrit,exuxto9,t3_cucfpu,1566589710.0,"Define the fingers and toes. Your shading looks like it's just a darker color of the object, which is not necessarily a bad thing. It can look more realistic and developed if you take just a smidge of the objects contrast color and mix it with the original color for shadows. Ex- if you're drawing a red apple, dont just make the shadow a darker red, or red mixed with black, use a bit of green in the shadow."
ArtCrit,exuwwhu,t3_cuimxu,1566589360.0,Love it. The perspective is on point and I like the color scheme. I might recommend boosting the contrast. Maybe taking a bright white pen/pencil and adding just a *hint* of super white details to the lighter areas. Same with the shadows. Great work.
BPD,expa0xm,t3_ctuxk2,1566487849.0,"When I was a suicide risk I saw my psychiatrist and therapist and they agreed I needed to be hospitalized- they said to call someone I trust and have them take me to the hospital. I called my mom and she said she couldn't because she was busy  and ""sometimes I need to think about other people"". I had my roommate take me.

Never gonna forget that one."
BPD,ewsf39g,t1_ews9ljz,1565726244.0,"Dang brother/sister, sorry to hear about your family member. And you're right, as sad as it is not everyone will win their battles. Thank you"
