Now we need to take out massive college debt just to get a job that pays half that if we’re lucky. Over half of millennials will be apartment dwellers for life because they’ll never be able to buy a home. Older people who spent a life time building a retirement are being fired before they collect their benefits in lieu of a younger employee who can be paid less. In the 1970’s the American middle class held the vast majority of the wealth in this country and over time its slowly been squandered by the wealthy elites. This is why it’s so important to know our history. It’s my personal opinion that rich people won’t stop until the 99% has almost nothing. Slavery is alive and well. No wonder so many people on this forum are suicidally depressed. This world is becoming pure shit!"
SuicideWatch,fpnvx0w,t3_ge4tw1,1588773666.0,Amen to everything you said! The whole “you can be anything you want to be” thing is mostly bull crap. It’s staggering how much of our life is completely out of our control. I too have lived most of my life in poverty and struggling for money and I get so tired of it. A lot of it is greed. The middle class is shrinking rapidly. There was a time when normal people didn’t struggle so hard. Now the only people who are not struggling are the executives who make a salary 500 times greater than their employees! I’d have an easier time if I felt like I was actually working toward something instead of trying to survive. I’m just so worn down and exhausted by trying to stay afloat in this world. I feel like all I’m doing is making some rich guy richer just so I can barely afford to buy enough to food to survive on.
unpopularopinion,fpnua1u,t1_fpjqjre,1588772729.0,"I like clingy guys! The best partner I ever had was also the clingiest. Sadly he passed away years ago but I’m still obsessed with him to this day because I’ve never been loved like that before or after. I’d never felt that important to anyone. I never had to worry or wonder if he still loved me. He was always trying to see me or keeping in touch when we were apart. I don’t get why people want a cold, distant partner that doesn’t care. The second I feel like I have to beg for attention is the second I lose interest entirely. I’ll take clingy any day!"
SuicideWatch,fp5qsbg,t1_fp2xvuj,1588337697.0,"I’m so sorry to hear that. It’s hard when basically your entire world crumbles before your eyes. Like you, I don’t want to end my life and leave behind a legacy of pain but it’s so hard to find the will to go on sometimes."
abuse,foy9e7p,t1_fowyyuh,1588168218.0,Thanks. That helps a little. Never thought of it that way before.
SuicideWatch,folkc41,t1_foljvs1,1587864096.0,The guy that pulled the trigger is already on death row and his accomplice got life in prison. I’m truly ready for the dude to be executed though. I wish both of them would be executed frankly.
SuicideWatch,fol5f97,t3_g80e6c,1587855236.0,I cut contact with a few family members and I honestly don’t regret it. The behavior was so toxic I’d feel sick after dealing with them. You did the right thing.
SuicideWatch,fokid1t,t3_g7szm1,1587842617.0,"Thanks so much for your response. That was very sincere. I wish that I could help you too but obviously I don’t even know how to help myself. I am 33 now and I lost my fiancé at age 25, met him at 24. You are still so young. As painful as it was to lose my fiancé, he was still the best thing that ever happened to me. Maybe in a few years something wonderful may happen to you too. Hang in there and always feel free to DM me if you’re having a hard time."
SuicideWatch,fokgmhx,t1_fok45u9,1587841700.0,I will.
SuicideWatch,fokffbe,t1_fojsnas,1587841070.0,"I work with special needs children. It does give me some sense of purpose but not enough. I do not think I will ever have a relationship that significant again unfortunately. I don’t have an easy time getting attached because my fear of losing someone is too strong now . Also I’m not emotionally present because I’m stuck in the past. Not to sound corny but I know he was my soulmate if those exist. All my relationships except that one were horrible.
I think it would be easier to move on if he hadn’t been murdered. It took almost 2 weeks for his body to be found and there couldn’t even be a proper funeral because his body had started to decompose. He had been shot in the head 5 times and the sad thing is he didn’t even have any money on him to rob because he had just lost his job. He was cremated and I never saw his face again. Then the story ended up all over the news and I couldn’t escape the reminders. I’m just so scarred from the whole experience that I never want to get attached again."
SuicideWatch,fokdz89,t1_fok2zfr,1587840300.0,I’ve really tried to be open minded but my heart isn’t in it. I find that I don’t make a very good partner anymore because I’m not emotionally present. Would you want to date someone who is still stuck on someone from the past? I’m what you call “emotionally unavailable”. I’m doing someone a favor by not getting involved. I’d only end up hurting them.
