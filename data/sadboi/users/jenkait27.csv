AmItheAsshole,fpqtts7,t1_fpqn2jg,1588832042.0,"Ok. “I deserve it” sounds like a selfish statement (the word deserve sounds selfish) but it IS the insanity!  It could be “I deserve it because it’s Tuesday”, that’s totally stupid and makes no sense, but an alcoholic person would totally say it. What if this person had just got a DUI, AND got drunk and harmed their family, AND was told they have cirrhosis? They’d still find a way to rationalize it!

The addicted brain is on a suicide mission and I could never call it “selfish”. Whoever came up with explaining the brain’s rationalizing as “I Deserve It Because...” *really* didn’t do addicts any favours!  Rationalizing isn’t even right. The brain tricks the alcoholic.  

I hope your husband continues to recover!  I would 100% would believe you’ve been through hell, don’t get me wrong. It’s just that the stigma of addiction keeps people sick and keeps everyone suffering. It sounds like nitpicking, but even the term Substance Use Disorder has been a game changer."

You don’t get it. The brain is literally malfunctioning, that’s what addiction is. Doesn’t mean you should accept being stole/lied from, not at all. Kick anyone doing that out of your life!  But do a little research before you say stuff like the above. 

Destroying your body, destroying your family, losing your job, your home, and everything you had, risking jail and a criminal record...that’s not selfish, that’s absolutely INSANE."

No....  the blood thinners only stop new clots from forming. The clots you have will take time to dissolve on their own. Then you will be able to breathe and feel relatively normal again. For me this took 11 weeks. It was amazing to feel better, but of course I was very deconditioned. That can be dealt with though.  Congratulations!  You survived!!  

I will add that you’ll probably panic at every twinge. I did. It’s like there’s a type of PTSD that comes alongside PE. Unpleasant but normal."

Last Dec I had blood clots in my lungs. Those cause 25% of people who have them to drop dead, no warning. I’m recovering but it is a LONG process, and let me you, the pandemic (respiratory!) isn’t exactly comforting. I’m terrified.

I guess when we’re young we all assume we’ll live to be 100 or whatever. We learn as we get older it’s more like 75, and things like cancer take people sooner...I totally knew that. But holy shit, I had no idea I would have bilateral PE and dodge death at 41.  

But...I’m cured of worrying about aging!  I was ecstatic to turn 42, never thought I’d feel that way. 

Also-I learned that being number-old and feeling old are two entirely different things. That was a wake-up slap too.

This sept I got sick and asthma flared, and basically I was short of breath, painfully, desperately so, all the time. I took prednisone for months,inhalers did nothing, omg. My GP and asthma dr both said it was anxiety.  I was so tired, exhausted and defeated I could barely get through the day and take care of my child. Wheezing sometimes, silent tight chest. Friends pushed me to go back to the dr, and I said “I think I’m in heart failure”. Close...! It actually ended up being a bilateral PE-my lungs were full of blood clots 😳.

I am still short of breath and so fatigued a month after (apparently normal!) and the asthma symptoms persist. I just have regular asthma now and I don’t think it’s going to go away.

How to get good sleep is of course an issue. Personally Id go to the dr, tell them everything, and ask for temporary sleeping meds, just to gain a little bit of reprieve here. Not sleeping will make you lose you sanity, seriously.

legaladvice,eyc0fln,t3_cwizrh,1566994672.0,"It bothers me a bit that your male nurse partner talked to management first.  Wouldn’t it have have been better if you told management your own story first? I’m just concerned he has the same story as you. And definitely note that you asked for more help, that’s significant. I’m an RN too fwiw. I’ll be thinking of you."
legaladvice,eyazvsn,t3_cwdi0u,1566973066.0,"Take all the advice above: don’t sign a thing. Hospitals will lie to family! They just want anyone on the hook for the bill. You’re young and it would be terrible to be saddled with his debt. Because once you sign, they have you on the hook for his bills. It’s not just some BS “help him with some money when he gets out”.  You can do it: JUST SAY NO. And your dad can get up and walk out of there. Hope he recovers soon."

kratom,ewo1xhh,t3_covevn,1565601738.0,"I wish I could say something to reassure you/change what you’re thinking!

I have two branches of family, one that resists medication at all costs and the other took pills almost compulsively. It’s true that your family of origin influences you, but I hope you can remember you randomly ended up in a family with that opinion. It could’ve gone the other way.

If you feel you take it often, ever consider dosing less with more kratom? I maybe take a similar amount total but twice a day. I can see feeling “dependent” if you are taking it frequently, because you’re always going to be reaching for it and would have to bring it with you, etc.  FWIW, know I’m dependent but it doesn’t bother me, I know what a godsend it is to me."

If a person in your situation makes any payment, it’s like waving your hand and saying “I’m responsible for this debt”. Don’t pay one cent!! Tell your brothers too.

UpliftingNews,ethwcs8,t3_cbobo7,1562829429.0,I love what he says at the end: “There’s no need to be afraid of fostering older children”.  I think he hit the nail on the head-people who might want to foster are intimidated at the idea. I think this beautiful article will change some minds.

My parents hit us too (in the 80s it was acceptable) and now that I have a 3 year old I’m tempted to hit him too sometimes!  I don’t but WOW is it hard being the first generation that doesn’t hit!!  I just want to tell you that. When you’ve been hit, it’s like an instinct I think. You slipped up and hurt him but you made it better. You have totally made progress in your own family convincing them of alternate punishments and I bet you will not hit your own kids.  Forgive yourself, sounds like your little bro has."
confession,erx0wla,t3_c3dpvw,1561365986.0,"I imagine what your mom said on the day that went down was pretty legit about how she was feeling!

I have a son, he’s only 3 and if he did that to me as a teen I’d probably react the same way, feel really ashamed and horrified and really low. However, if he came to me years later giving me money and apologizing, I’d accept the apology but not the money. I imagine she would do the same, or accept both (but that’s fair too).

Good luck, I think you can make this one right."
