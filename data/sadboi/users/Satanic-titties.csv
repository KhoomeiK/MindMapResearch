My friends thought it would be funny to challenge one of our other friends who played a lot of video games and was confident he could beat me. However, I had a controller that wasn’t linked to the PlayStation. Instead my friend was playing with the actually controller under a blanket behind us. The whole time I was just pressing random buttons. 

The entire game he played as the goalkeeper and won 5-1. Our friend was so frustrated and still goes on about what a terrible loss it was for him to this day. It wasn’t a big prank, but it still plays on his mind. Making it a success."

And while I’m not particularly a fan of being around children (purely through lack of experience with them, I’m sure it will be different when/if I have my own), I think it’s ridiculous that anyone can have that opinion towards them. 

I really don’t think that these people should be allowed to have an opinion on how people choose to parent their children, or how children behave if they are not a parent themselves. Are they not aware they were once children themselves? Children that more than likely misbehaved and had parents that were stressed and made mistakes? I really don’t understand"

I guess the puppy was lucky because she was then sent to a nice home and even visited her parents sometimes. And people that buy pugs and stuff that have no idea of the damage to their health through breeding. Don’t get a dog if you can’t fully take care of it is something I absolutely agree with"

Arthur is only 9 months old, but we took him to a farm once and he started rounding up sheep and cows. 

The difference is the control the owner has on the dog, the different commands and how often the dog is around sheep. Border collies are super intelligent. If you watch the sheep hearding competitions, like One Man and His Dog, you can really see it there."
