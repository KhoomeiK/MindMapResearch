socialskills,fr49yay,t3_gm4c5n,1589881113.0,"Same here, and it ruined my relationship. The advice I can give you is talk about it - even lowkey - if things get more serious, I didn't and it got worse during quarantine my partner thought that was me. It was not, it was me depression-drained.
And try hard to not make the relationship your only source of  happiness - it puts too much pression on the other person.
Also therapy could really help, even though it's all blocked now in lockdown."

motorcycles,fpngzbi,t3_gdagmx,1588762549.0,"Newbie here, I've bought my first bike (yamaha mt03 2020) earlier this year and I think it's time to get a jacket and proper gloves.  
As there's many brands out there it's a bit confusing, of course I had dainese or alpinestars in mind but i also came across rev'it gear so I'd be great to hear some opinion on those brands, given that I'm no expert.
What kind of protections are best on a jacket for instance? 
Also I saw that for ladies product's choice is a bit limited, are there any significant differences in man/women protective gear or is it just the shape?"
mentalhealth,fplus5u,t3_ge1dz0,1588719876.0,"I hated it, I watched it while i was not in the best place and i truly hated the way it romanticises suicide and drops everything on the fault side. Also heard about the second season: put every 'hot' or highly debated topic and mix it together to get views, that's not how you make series, and I'm sure that's not how you spread awareness."
relationship_advice,foo3671,t1_foo1soe,1587931594.0,"Could you be a bit more specific on the red flags please?
Well we met at work without knowing each other's age, we fell for each other and we discussed about it: we both don't feel any significant age difference.
It's not a comparison between people, we felt great together (before this quarantine).
I've never met a person that feels so compatible with my character before. I'm not sure he's the man of my life but I think age is not the point.
Really though, I'm curious about the red flags as I'm not sure I can recognise all of them."
