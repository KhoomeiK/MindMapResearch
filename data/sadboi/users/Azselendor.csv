STO's puzzles aren't that complex and rather simplistic --  but they aren't user or player friendly either.

That said, Cryptic gave us Echoes of Light (and a lot of new frontiers arc itself) which featured a puzzle and more exploration focused missions for a little bit (before sliding into space war).  And say what you will about dust to dust, the maze was my favorite part and the mission did challenge the player on skill over pew-pew powers.

Personally I would like to see puzzles like those from games like Myst or Riven where the players are rewarded for exploring and solving things and interacting with the game world.   Those puzzles aren't complex either (most of the time)  but I always felt great when I did solve them  (even if I had to use a guide every now and then).    Cryptic can also randomize the puzzle components a bit to create new experiences, I would think and reward the player with pieces of lore and other random bits for going off the beaten path. 

So I guess it boils down to what cryptic has time for and ability to implement.  I suppose thats why a lot of missions boil down to warp in, character talks.  shoot space weapons, character talks, space war more, talking heads, space war, collect reward.

weapons are basically dictated by ease and scale they can be deployed and ability to make.   So basically the cheapest and most reliable weapon will dominate.  

also you might want to look into the movie gravity.  They have an event there where earth's local space is rendered inaccessible because of the increasing amount of shrapnel and debris rendering spaceflight impossible.  I forget what it's called but it's a horrific thing if deployed as a weapon to blockade or lay siege to a planet.  The expanse also touches upon a similar event during a battle with orbital mirrors in the crossfire."

That said, just before all the pandemic lock down stuff game down, Section 31 halted production (they were building sets) and moved everything into storage.  I don't think it was cancelled at all (even your link which redirects to the front page of that site now) said ""on hold""  but that most likely has more to do with Michelle Yeoh having hot-property status with a number of films tied to her, included several Avatar films (no not the cool Avatar series, the smurf ones).  If you look at her IMDB, the last few years she normally does 3-4 projects a year (except this year for obvious reasons) and the next few years are mostly booked up.

That said, I think the powers that be haven't sold the idea of a section 31 show since audiences has only a handful of experiences with section 31 across various series and it feels like they are trying to make section 31 into star trek's version of torchwood.  Personally I don't think that's a good idea or model to follow.   Especially if they use time travel to send Michelle Yeoh back in time or something.   If anything, leave her in the 33rd century with Discovery but show us a Section 31 that is completely different from prior incarnations.  Maybe a millennia into the future Section 31 is something like  issac asimov's  Foundation (or even second foundation).

**Bounties**
Unlike many, I didn't have too much issues with the bounties as others in terms of them existing.  What I did have a problem with was how they implemented or how bounties are implemented and handled in the game as well but more on that later.   I found very few bounties synergized with activities I was playing when I was playing them

**Game Stability**
I frequently experienced game freezes requiring a reboot of my xbox upon visiting the tower.  It was enough to put down the controller.  

**Pursuits & Bounties Screen**
Seriously, this needed be fixed before the event.  I have a backlog of 53 quests or so because some missions are simply too hard for me to solo or need me to get X hundred of Y before I can move to step Z.  I'd drop them but I'm sure half I can't ever get back if I do thanks to Destiny brand FOMO^TM.  So that means I have to juggle my regular bounties with seasonal bounties with event bounties with special event bounties.   guess which ones I skip because I can't play efficient because of this terrible goddamn UI that exists!   So while some can fly around, pickup all the bounties and bock a few thousand of every currency in the game, I have to make 10 trips or so to manage 10 bounty slots.  Do you know what your load times are!?! 

**Load Times this Event**
speaking of load times and game issues...  Do you know what your load times are!?!   Nothing like loading into something completely missing it or getting kicked out of a game because the screen was black while loading took its time.

**Triumphs and the Heir Apparent**
I get making different aspects of the game have a focus but I haven't been to the forges in ages because they are needless complicated.  A lot of other game things too.   I haven't completed a black armory weapon since its rewarding experience was depreciated in favor of pushing expiring content.  I kept forgetting it was a part of the event too.  Either way, the grind for the triumphs was too much for my limited about of time to play to earn the weapon.   Like most events, instead of rewarding me for playing the event with progress of the grand goal, after all the hours spent playing I only managed to progress the triumph book to 2 out of 7 in progress.   This game needs to reward gameplay itself over making me jump through hundreds of hoops and punishing me for not fully understanding things when its not explained in game how the damned event even works! Then I wouldn't waste what time I do have to play for smallest morsels of progress.  *It's just not fun if the game isn't rewarding.*

Why couldn't I devote myself to 30-60 minutes a day to earn progress towards the reward and play other stuff in the game or let me earn X amount of laurels to buy a rewarding thingy?  Why do I have to shovel crap for nothing in this game?

It was a neat looking gun, but thats all it'll be now.

**A cool looking event where the real reward was in my wallet**
Because I'm not gonna buy event rewards out of the goddamn eververse.  Stop trying, its not working, its just making me more and more angry with you and the game.   If you want me to just buy out the event and get all the goodies, i'm fine with that.  But don't take all the cool looking stuff, stuff it into the store and then give me this event where I have to do a bunch of stuff for a thing to collect a bunch of check marks to not get the thing after a month.

It all flies apart in the Battle over Pahvo and Section 31 battle.

* Pahvo:  Why did the klingon ship pull up and park, cloak then continue to sit there while being pounded on? No mention that engines were disabled and the Klingons seemed to exude confidence the day was there, not a battle becoming more and more desperate as the tide turns against them as their ship fails them. Also, one seen shows the discovery apparently above looking down on the Sarcophagus Ship before firing but the companion vfx shows Discovery sitting off its bow.  

* Section 31 battle:   Just a complete mess.  audio and visuals don't line up 90% of the time (listen for torpedoes and then you realize the phasers aren't sync'ed up either).  Battlechatter on the bridges were also a mess and the dialogue relating to the battle as well.   It's a battle, not a 'lets catch up the audience' scene.  BattleChatter platitudes!? Also.  Why are the ships in park!?  but moving---  but in park!  then suddenly the discovery is flying off in the distance!?  And the klingons arrive.  And the kelpians in stolen spaceships. and then more klingons.  And let's not bring up the shuttles and flyers.  I think about 75% of that battle could've been deleted with no negative impact to the battle itself, maybe even improvement.   


Personally I would've, for the section 31 battle, is completely delete the shuttles, flyers and red angel suit.  All of that gets combined into discovery.  Discovery can't recreate the red angel suit, but it can use the sphere data, a time crystal, the spore drive and the surviving parts from the other red angel suit to turn discovery into its own red angel and while Discovery is running the calculations/etc/etc the ship has to be immobilized.

The Enterprise now becomes the ship's bodyguard in the battle, but Number One pulled some strings and got three other constitution class ships sneak off and join them (These Connies should have different configurations matching the Cage, TOS and even a Disco version with a straight pylon instead of swept.  Also, the USS Farragut is specific excluded from the three connies)  So now we have four constitutions protecting the Discovery vs the 31 ships of section 31 and their drone swarm.  Now in the first half the battle control launches both conventional attacks and starts hacking the constitution class ships.  One gets overwhelmed and turns its guns on the enterprise & a connie before being disabled.  A 2nd is hacked through its holographic comms and the crew is seen fighting holograms.  Section 31 then deploys its anti-starship missile against Discovery but Enterprise takes the blow to the saucer.  Unexploded torp in the saucer scene then plays out mostly normal.  Final scene gets change.  Que the Cleave ship scene!  that stays the same, the Ba'ul/kelpian fighters turn up but reveal they have elected to join the Klingon Empire over the Federation as Saru and Sirana have a much shorter talk. The battle the Klingons D7's then swoop in to steal the day from starfleet's ""reckless galaxy destroying antics and l'rell promises to check & contain the federation's hubris from wiping out all life going forward."" (to lay the foundation for the federation-klingon cold war in TOS and echoing to T'Kuvma's speech in the first episode). 

The combined battle then continues with the starfleet and klingon ships destroying section 31 ships, but Leeland manages to get on to discovery quietly and starts to infiltrate the ship and tries to corrupt the sphere data/program with control's and remotely take over the red angel time travel controls.   Most of the rest plays out the same except Yum Yum line is completely deleted, cut removed and burned before being buried hundreds of feet underground in an undisclosed remove location under a never used highway ramp.  What does happen is Lt. Nahn gets invited to go after Leeland and pulls out a [Tellarite Cudgel](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/memoryalpha/images/f/f7/Harry_mudd_with_cudgel.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20190106062157&path-prefix=en) with an evil smirk. But Leeland succeeds in locking out some of the controls forcing the discovery to jump the future without certainty of arrival.  It could arrive a day into the future, 500 years, 930 years and anywhere anywhen now (putting the finale into a question mark if they succeed).  Leeland is stopped and the crew discovers he is trying to send the ship back in time to just before Season 1. ""We must stop the future!""

As the battle winds down the Discovery makes the jump into the future, seemingly exploding into a ""lightening storm in space"" (prompting Pike to mutter something like 'another ship lost to the storm' referencing the loss of the USS Kelvin -- and yes, I'm adding the opening of ST09 into the prime universe, but played differently...that another day)  Anyhoo, the Discovery disappears into the future.  Then we get a similar sequence to the time travel scenes of both Burnham and the Discovery another Red Angel appears, but doesn't speak and isn't burnham's mom but guides the Discovery through the time-wormhole to the future and sets the signals for Discovery.

The rest of the episode plays out the same except the addition of a final scene.

Burnham, separated and alone from Discovery on a desolate alien world is joined by the 3rd Angel.  before it departs, it appears to Burnham and speaks a single line. ""[It's coming to an end because of what you did. You have no idea how many lives you've saved.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZMEvkuE-6w)"" and disappears.  Burnham finds a ruined, torn and rotted Federation flag where the Angel once stood in the soil.

Then roll credits and end my rant so I can get back to work."

StarTrekDiscovery,fq2k4jn,t1_fq04j9r,1589056909.0,"The advantage of TOS when it came to canon is that it came first and doesn't have to worry about canon.  In fact you can find many episodes don't even remain consistent from one to another while the show was in production.  

The TNG era further compounded this issue when they made the choice to treat TOS as a historical document to later canon (and thus binding themselves to the look and style) which some fans took as immutable laws of trek universe.  Including some of the stuff that hasn't aged well.

All that said, I wouldn't be opposed to a rebooting of star trek, keeping the episodic format, but retelling the TOS era with story rules kept consistent across the entire run -- but should also be aware of and move away from the tropes common in a lot of film and cinema today so Trek stands out from the rest.

As for lifting stories, star trek retelling stories is nothing new.  TOS would frequently tell the same story three different POV's.  One episode would impact the main three directly, then the ship as a whole and then a guest star of the week."
