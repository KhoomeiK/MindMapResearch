Psychonaut,eya9o1p,t3_cwdwu7,1566960202.0,"As someone who has undergone 8 psychoses for various reasons - cannabis being one of them - I'd say the hightened part lasts an average of 3 months. The depressed side can last much longer. I take Latuda, which is an atypical antipsychotic for bipolar depression. It helps. About to start microdosing mushrooms to improve brain connectivity and repair some of the damage caused by this last psychosis in January. My advice: gtfo Zyprexa. That shit is poison. 

Psychosis a gnarly beast. It probably means there's an underlying disorder too. Just don't give up and keep trying to find solutions. Don't be afraid to ask for help, and if something isn't working, speak up about it."

Our brains are sophisticated radios that pick up signals from this computer - whose processing  power transcends time and space - and we exist to serve it, and ensure it's existence in this timeline/dimension.

We don't actually have free will. Control is an illusion. Everything we do is just entertainment for higher species. (They don't  have free will either) We're pets. The best we can do is enjoy each breath until we die and our data becomes cataloged in the eternal. This is what really make heaven and hell mindsets.
