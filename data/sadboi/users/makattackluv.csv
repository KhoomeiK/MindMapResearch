BPD,fqdwnxx,t1_fqdkdw7,1589297890.0,I'm curious how many people have been successful in a longterm relationship. And if anyone has any opinions on it I'd love to hear their point of view on relationships with bpd.
BorderlinePDisorder,fqcpplt,t1_fqcn4pp,1589264954.0,"""Splitting is a term used in psychiatry to describe the inability to hold opposing thoughts, feelings, or beliefs. Some might say that a person who splits sees the world in terms of¬†black or white‚Äîall or nothing. It's a distorted way of thinking in which the positive or negative attributes of a person or event are neither weighed nor cohesive."" This is a website grab. I'd look it up online to best understand it. It affects everyone a little different and there tends to be more ties that connect to it."
BPD,fq8qrt3,t3_gh79s5,1589172922.0,I ALWAYS over explain myself out of fear someone will miss read my intentions or my thoughts. I'd rather be clear and say to much then leave people wondering what it is that I mean. I'm actually trying to work on this. I over explain until I know you dont care anymore then I write it out and delete it and shorten it. I have this need. I have to say whats on my mind or I'm uncomfortable and feel like I'm gonna explode.

BPD,fq792ey,t1_fq62pcl,1589143356.0,I'm so sorry to hear that. It's taken me a really long time to realize I dont need to morph into someone else. Definitely be yourself and the right people will show up. Were very easy to manipulate and I'm so sorry that people have done that.
BPD,fq78ho1,t1_fq5tw20,1589143141.0,Black and white thinking gets the best of us I swear. It's so hard to differ when you're being rational or emotional too.
BPD,fq780df,t1_fq5cl35,1589142968.0,I'm proud of you! Splitting is so hard to lessen and even stop.
BPD,fq5331u,t1_fq4zgzr,1589090993.0,"I'm so sorry that you had to grow up and deal with that. 
I've been diagnosed for over a year now and everything started clicking into place so I get exactly what you mean. I'm so happy that you've found your person that has to feel amazing. Cutting people is so hard yet so easy it's so hard to explain for myself personally. I'm proud of you! Keep doing what's best for you and who you are love.‚ù§"

BPD,fq4tmzd,t1_fq4s9u6,1589083909.0,I can never get passed feeling alone. That feeling of just being there is all to real. My abandonment runs all of my relationships and usually ruins them. It usually forces me to lash out without thinking about it.
BPD,fq4tet7,t1_fq4spv8,1589083759.0,I definitely need to get my abandonment issues under control so I get what you mean completely!

BPD,fps5sve,t3_gf28wk,1588867948.0,I've always had difficulties getting anything virtual or character like to come out to actually look like me. I always see everyone's like sims or bitmoji things of that nature and it always confuses me that they actually look like them. I never thought about how I see myself until this last year and then I noticed that I struggle with it also.
BPD,fplvwby,t1_foulr4n,1588720486.0,Literally something I always do. I just had an amazing thing going for me and I impulsively pushed as hard as I could with one single sentence and ended the relationship all because I wasnt getting the attention that I needed at that moment. Its something I haven't figured out to ignore yet. It's like word vomit that has to come out or it eats at me. I hate myself for it and I wish I could stop it.
BPD,fplus8o,t3_gdvigh,1588719878.0,I'm the same way! I have this obsession with needing to be wanted or appealing to everyone. I always thought I was alone in it and it wasnt something I ever shared with friends to try to talk about. I'm glad I stumbled on this to see that its more common then my brain convinced itself.
PunkGirls,fpj6whw,t3_gdpmps,1588658374.0,This is adorable get ittt!
