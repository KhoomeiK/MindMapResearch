mysticmessenger,fqogra0,t3_gdx2n6,1589514880.0,"are you able to keep repeating the chat room (19:18) despite the time being different? (so if you saved it, reload it, and keep playing the chat room again and again) to farm quickly, or do you have to wait for that time to come around every day?"

depression,fngxny6,t3_g1jxci,1586948734.0,"it’s incomprehensible how much your post resonates with me. im the same age and uni wise, having struggled with myself and happiness. i recently went through a depressive episode and got through it.. things were finally starting to get better and i was getting myself to be happier and busier (although this wasn’t necessarily truthful) then this pandemic happened and i’ve fallen into what you would say is a neutral state. i’m not truly happy but not sad either. it’s weird trying to make sense of it.. but it doesn’t feel all that great either way. there’s a feeling of uselessness without the guise of productiveness and a sense of guilt for being able to stay home (while knowing others aren’t able to have the same privilege of that)... i kinda
feel numb and don’t care about trying anymore? 

what makes it even worse is when people tell you to chill out bc other people have it harder than you. this may be true but that shouldn’t negate how a person feels. i don’t have much advice since i’m also struggling but just know ur not alone in being in a strange neutral not neutral state"
