Your children will adapt her behaviour and for the love of god, dont let that happen.. even further they'll get a whole bunch of wrong images on how a relationship should be. Loving and kind. Even tho your wife is cold and umwilling to love you, there must be something wrong with her.. no offense .
 But has she seen a therapist lately?"

depression,ey2v32l,t3_cva1lf,1566749004.0,"Hey you are not alone:) Neither with your feelings nor with the ignorance of that girl. I know it fucking hurts, that she probably doesnt care as much as you do. At this point the only thing in your mind is her.. but I'm 100% sure you aren't missing her, but rather those imaginary situations, which aren't happening. Like a hug from her, a kiss, cuddling or even just a chat .. I've been there many times and with that knowledge I can confidently say, that it is your choice, your will. Free your mind of her and forget what never happend. It will take time, but in the end it's worth it to be happy again. Be proud that you had the balls to talk to her and use it as your basis. Everyone gets rejected at some point. And Yes, even the Chads out there!"

I do have 2 140mm front fans, 1 top and 1 rear fan. Is it worth buying it or should I get a Strix / Gaming X Trio for about 1,2k?"

I sent the old one to BeQuiet and it will take 4 weeks to repair it. Guess I'll sell it after the refresh. Thanks for the help:)"
