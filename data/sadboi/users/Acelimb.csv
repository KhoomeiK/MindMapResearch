depression,euyd1hp,t3_chql98,1564099907.0,"I am a bit same. I go to work, and do more than I should. Socialize even though I’m very anxious. I’ve hadn’t had a problem with working out or getting work done, I just became apathetic to entertainment. I can’t read a book, can’t play games, watch a movie, or anything. I’m 21 and I hope not to live for the future."
