I don't know myself or my purpose I don't like what I do anymore and I just sleep constantly and escape to the dream world because that's the only place that I can be happy. I also get people trying to give me advise when they don't even listen in the first place to my issues and people who think they have me all figured out. It's sickening just how much no one will even bother to listen. Most of all however I just want peace and quiet and to be left alone yet even the latter just isn't happening it would seem.
