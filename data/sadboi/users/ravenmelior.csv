You explained to him you didn't feel like joking around and it seems like he didn't respond to YOU but more so about how what you said made HIM feel. A better approach on his part would've been to acknowledge what you were feeling. You might be experiencing emotions related to stress, worry, frustration etc and might need to talk it through instead of chastised because you're not taking his jokes well. His ""joking"" might certainly be something he does often but that doesn't mean you have to like it or take it. You shouldn't be judged because you feel things nor should your emotions be minimized because you're somehow supposed to only exist for his needs regardless of what you're feeling."

I don't think you should go against what your standards of marriage are because you may not be able to live with it.

The desire to be unburdened is important because it can fuel your motivation to grow and heal. For now, I would suggest focusing on yourself and leaving the notion of forgiveness for another time. I personally have never really forgiven my abusers, but I have been able to connect the dots on their behaviors, and understand why certain people abandoned me when the abuse came out. In doing this, I realized how weak, selfish and pathetic they were and how strong and resilient I was. That helped me way more than forgiving them could."

Unfortunately, there's literally no guarantee one way or another. But there is the consideration of the many good people you could miss out on knowing and potentially caring about. These individuals could miss out on knowing and caring about you. To trust another requires an inherent courage, to understand the dangers of the unknown and try regardless. Sometimes it's not worth it, sometimes it shreds your insides and you swear you could never do it again. Other times, people surprise you. Maybe others who have been shredded, too?

I think it was my abuser's attempt to fully negate what I said AND make me feel inferior/stupid for being upset. Ultimately, I leaned that finding peace and making amends is more an individual process, especially if the other person (abuser) is not willing to hear you out and more importantly be accountable for what they've done.

I found out he never saw me as a daughter when his sexual intentions came out in my early twenties. My mother chose to ""stick by her man"" and this was more devastating than any of the disgusting things he did. I have been able to successfully extricate myself from the family. I do experience feelings of loneliness but at least I feel safe. I don't have much in the way of extended family but I've been able to create a better circle for myself.

Growth is so crucial as life goes along and it is possible to grow into a person who values a long-term relationship more than you thought in the past. The fact that you're even entertaining the possibility of entering into therapy (I'm assuming to deal with past things in an effort to further your relationship) is a small step towards something.

I'd done some minimal therapy that I didn't complete before that because I really wasn't ready. I believe, for me, I needed that much insight into myself and my past before I was ready to try EMDR.

There is nothing that can validate your feelings more than your experience. You know what you experienced and what your mother put you through.

Abuse from a parent is so insidious because it tends to permeate all aspects of one's life, even after the active abuse stops. What you described is something I can relate to. I used to hide my pain through humor and was able to manage forward motion (but not necessarily progress) because of my survival instincts. Once my life truly stabilized and I had a supportive, loving partner all of the walls I had built up began to crumble. I could no longer laugh to manage and even my previous instincts to keep moving we're depleted. A therapist told me it seemed like this happened because I finally felt safe and loved. My subconscious mind was probably waiting for the right moment in time to unburden itself. Although it was hard work to make it out from under the umbrella of abuse, the hardest work has been truly coming to terms with it all.

There were two pieces of clothing that I cherished above all else: a colorful button up shirt and a vest that had the softest material I'd ever felt. Great pieces of clothing, but more importantly to me, gifts from my grandfather. I decided to keep playing outside and when I came in, BPD said she'd taken care of it. She gave away so much of my clothes, including those cherished pieces. I confronted her but she similarly blamed me for not doing it myself.

You shouldn't have to ""stuff this one back in"". This is your life, those horrible memories are your experiences. Unfortunately, things that are ready to come to light are going to come. Maybe taking a step back to identify where you are may be best instead of having to decide how to go about confronting them. You mentioned that they've tried but there seem to be things about their recent behavior that may be concerning such as the reaction to your engagement (which should've been a lot of hugging, excitement and congratulations).

I have people who love me, people I've chosen but the place from where I came is convoluted and empty. The best way I can describe it is like when one is looking at a family tree. Those connections that grow over generations are part of my issue because for me there's so many missing. I had my daughter at a very young age and while there's many contributing factors, the main reason is because I needed a tether. I've realized over time that I cannot replicate what should've been, I can only build from where I am. I love being a parent, I love being able to have a family but because I became a parent so young, my path to healing has been wedged between caring for my children, at times tightly and painfully. My advice is to heal yourself first. Focus on what you're experiencing and be open to what it can teach you. It'll be difficult and painful but it is worth it.

I didn't have it but have been able to offer it to my own kids, something I didn't think was possible. It may sound horribly cliche, but forgiving yourself (because you had no control over any of this) is a good place to start. We sometimes cannot get what we need the most but we can be what we needed from others for ourselves. It's a process, like with anything else. I hope you can find support and guidance. There are resources who can help you."

Yes. If only it were easier to connect through this pain instead of being delegated to groups of those who have to look like us or come from where we come from."
raisedbyborderlines,eu5jz2t,t1_eu55gdy,1563479175.0,Wow. Thanks for sharing this. I've never realized why being alone after an episode is so important to me. Too much stress overwhelms me but also makes me feel like I'm being chipped away and somewhat invisible. I've been no contact from my BPD mother for five years and I'm at a point where the true scope of trauma that I've experienced is coming to the surface. It's terrifying and exhausting but I know it's the only way to deal with what I can only describe as poison inside of me.
science,etx7hnp,t1_etwthsy,1563293247.0,I agree. I've talked to older family members/colleagues who now realize either they or someone they knew suffered from an undiagnosed mental disorder. It just wasn't on the radar.
