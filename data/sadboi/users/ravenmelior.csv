A better approach on his part would've been to acknowledge what you were feeling. You might be experiencing emotions related to stress, worry, frustration etc and might need to talk it through instead of chastised because you're not taking his jokes well. His ""joking"" might certainly be something he does often but that doesn't mean you have to like it or take it.

I personally have never really forgiven my abusers, but I have been able to connect the dots on their behaviors, and understand why certain people abandoned me when the abuse came out.

Once my life truly stabilized and I had a supportive, loving partner all of the walls I had built up began to crumble. I could no longer laugh to manage and even my previous instincts to keep moving we're depleted. A therapist told me it seemed like this happened because I finally felt safe and loved.

I've realized over time that I cannot replicate what should've been, I can only build from where I am.

We get molded to serve a purpose, but our true purpose can still be found."
ptsd,eu6dxph,t1_eu694yg,1563498086.0,"I'm sorry for all you've experienced and even more so that you have come to feel this way about yourself. I agree about the power of a parent's love. I didn't have it but have been able to offer it to my own kids, something I didn't think was possible. It may sound horribly cliche, but forgiving yourself (because you had no control over any of this) is a good place to start. We sometimes cannot get what we need the most but we can be what we needed from others for ourselves. It's a process, like with anything else. I hope you can find support and guidance. There are resources who can help you."
ptsd,eu6ddb5,t1_eu620oa,1563497718.0,">But at the end of the day trauma is trauma. And no matter how u grew up. The pain is the same.

Yes. If only it were easier to connect through this pain instead of being delegated to groups of those who have to look like us or come from where we come from."
raisedbyborderlines,eu5jz2t,t1_eu55gdy,1563479175.0,Wow. Thanks for sharing this. I've never realized why being alone after an episode is so important to me. Too much stress overwhelms me but also makes me feel like I'm being chipped away and somewhat invisible. I've been no contact from my BPD mother for five years and I'm at a point where the true scope of trauma that I've experienced is coming to the surface. It's terrifying and exhausting but I know it's the only way to deal with what I can only describe as poison inside of me.
science,etx7hnp,t1_etwthsy,1563293247.0,I agree. I've talked to older family members/colleagues who now realize either they or someone they knew suffered from an undiagnosed mental disorder. It just wasn't on the radar.
