  3  4  5

1: what ""realm"" is the challenge in (what element - if non-elemental trump, consider it in a non-elemental-dependent place (sorry if I do not explain right)) XVI THE TOWER

2: ""the realm of the realm"" (ie earth part of water...). 
XV THE DEVIL

3: how will I strengthen if I complete the challenge?
XX AEON

4: how should I go about doing it?
IX THE HERMIT

5: what is the challenge?
ACE OF SWORDS

6: who are you/where is this challenge coming from?
KNIGHT (king in RW) OF DISKS (pentacles).

---
I can give my own interpretation, but I would love to hear what others think? 

For me, the Devil represents the addictions I am struggeling with (has come up as that before), and with the tower I interpret this challenge to be about defeating this. However, the Ace of Swords tells me this challenge takes place in my mind. (Also the hermit tells me to look inside myself). The aeon might represent the realisation of a utopia or transfprmation for the better. Not sure what I think about the knight.

I take my challenge to be creating a mental (positive) image of my future (?) sober self (which makes some sense since I tend to focus too much on what negatives the abuse gives me, and not the positives I might gain if (when) I quit), so that is what I will do today:) 

Would love to hear your thoughts, maybe especially in regards to the knight?

(Also a ""fun fact"": I had my dog choose my daily cards today (yes, she is an excellent picker). The cards she chose was the Ace of Swords by itself and the Tower and Queen of Cups as a pair.)
