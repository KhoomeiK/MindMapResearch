my mom will give me and my siblings a few chances before screaming at us and we always scramble to do what we need and my heart starts pounding.  last year, is when my anxiety got bad and my heart would beat so hard and so fast. it was so uncomfortable. i hate it when my parents yell at each other, too.

i remember a few months back, the administration in my school banned basketballs (they would let us go outside halfway through lunch if we wanted and there were a few basketball nets but the boys started throwing them at girls so the school banned them), and us being the dumb 8th graders we are, started a giant game of duck duck goose. when lunch was over,  i quickly rushed to tell my friends and we left. when o got up to the room, kids started piling in like usual, but then my teacher comes in. he slams the door and starts SCREAMING at us, because on the way back, some kids started chanting “WE WANT BALLS BACK!” and people were recording so my Social Studies teacher stopped them, and when he got upstairs started yelling at us. and me being the good child i am, was TERRIFIED. i then had to ask my teacher if i could get my stuff because i left it down stairs. he said yes, but i had to be quick. on the way down my heart started beating so loud and i started panicking a bit. i had to take a few breaths to calm down. it was rough. but the WEIRDEST THING was that when i got back, he was back to his normal, social self (he’s very social and likes talking to the students and he’s pretty chill). i was very confused. and when we left to go to the next class, i said “bye” and he said it back but in a sort of annoyed voice. then, when i went next door to my last class, I COULD HEAR HIM SCREAMING AGAIN! it was on a friday too so it was kinda rough. thank god nothing like that has happened since.
