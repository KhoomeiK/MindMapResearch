dryalcoholics,fqbcpin,t3_ghx5rf,1589234579.0,"I suspect the issue is that you have a much stronger appetite than when you were drinking. You might be eating healthier, but you're probably also eating more.

Weight loss is the same for alcoholics, non-alcoholics, smokers, gymnasts, Pokemon card collectors, and data scientists. You have to burn more calories than you consume, period. A pound of fat is worth 3,500 calories, so you have to have -3,500 calories in your diet for every pound you want to lose.

What you eat doesn't matter so much, in terms of weight loss. You can lose or gain weight eating pizza for every meal or salads. It all comes down to your calorie deficit. 

I'd recommend calorie counting. Maybe start using an app like My Fitness Pal. Track absolutely everything that you eat, and you'll get a better feel for how much you need to cut. A Fitbit can also do wonders in passively accounting for the number of calories you burn in a given day.

changemyview,fo6uzpq,t3_g5vyjk,1587567229.0,"Atheism isn't a worldview. It's a dismissal of a single proposition.

Because of that, the blanket term ""atheist"" describes so many different worldviews that it's almost unusable. You might as well say ""People who think Olive Garden is overrated can be just as toxic and annoying as Religious People."" That's an incredibly wide net to cast, so yeah, you're going to find some assholes in it.

Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, etc... are all moral systems with prescribed beliefs, so toxic behavior is either A) an incrimination of the underlying moral framework (if they're acting in alignment with it) or B) an incrimination of hypocrisy on the part of the individual (if they are not).

Atheism is not a moral framework, so atheists behaving badly isn't really incriminating of any broad mode of thought or hypocrisy on the part of the individual. 

This doesn't give asshole atheists a pass; it just means they're not incriminating a worldview through their behavior. So yeah, Atheists *can* be just as toxic and annoying as religious people, that's just not a very useful observation. Any person 100% assured of their correctness (whether backed by God or science) is well-positioned to be condescending, dismissive, or unsympathetic."

1. During the first month or so I did notice a few 2-3 day stints of low motivation. However, I'm a recovered alcoholic, so I experience that from time to time as Post Acute Withdrawal Symptoms. Impossible to run a control to weed out that variable.
2. Quite the opposite, in fact. I feel more organized and have an easier time setting goals for each 'quarter' of my day. They don't have to be extravagant, because unlike planning a whole day--which can be daunting and feel like a marathon--I'm really only ever figuring out what to do with the next 5 hours. I started this in November, which is National Write A Novel Month, and I was able to pound out 52,000 words while still going above and beyond in my work life... all while somehow finding I have *more* free time.
3. I'm not sure. For me, control over natural light is crux. Right now my mood is pretty in alignment with the time of day, which is morning here. I've got the windows open and I'm listening to the rain. By noon, I'm going to want it to feel more like evening though.   
Travel... this might actually be useful for travel. I've gotten to where I can get to sleep almost anywhere if I need to, including an airport during a layover. Flying out to see my family over Christmas didn't hurt at all. They were bewildered at how I was typing away and cooking all night while still being around all day to hang out, barring a couple of brief naps. I couldn't imagine traveling during the first three weeks, though. Absolute control over my environment was a must for getting acclimated. 

Hope this helps! Thanks for asking!"

Theoretical physics isn't strictly relevant beyond the strictures it places on communication and hypothetical weaponized applications, so maybe study that on the side and apply what you've learned from studying cultures.

It's admittedly a poor sample size. Aliens will almost certainly be radically, radically different than us, but so far humans are the only advanced society that we know. Evolutionary biology is also something worth getting a good handle on.

&#x200B;

The reason isn't as terribly mysterious as some other folks here might claim. Imagine a soup of chemicals all mixing together and interacting according to the principles you learned in high school chemistry. There's going to be a lot of variety, a lot of different kinds of molecules and macromolecules forming and unforming in the soup. 

&#x200B;

However, if one of those macromolecules ever happens to randomly take on a particular molecular structure that happens to interact with with the chemicals around it in such a way to create a rough copy of itself... well, nobody else is making copies in this soup, so whatever can replicate will quickly become more common than any other configuration. 

&#x200B;

Copies with random variations that make them better at copying or protecting their form from other chemical interactions will soon come to dominance. You can scale all of life upward from this fairly simple starting scenario."
