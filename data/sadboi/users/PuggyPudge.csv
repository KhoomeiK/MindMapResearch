rivalstars,fqmk3lq,t1_fqmjijn,1589478750.0,I was glad to finally find a decent horse games. My knowledge of horses is much better irl. Sometimes I was so confused by the colors/patterns i was getting! I enjoy the breeding aspect of this game.
rivalstars,fqmiu9c,t1_fqmidv9,1589478160.0,Thank you! I’m pretty new to this game so I don’t understand how to colors work yet.

rivalstars,fqmh70k,t1_fqmgieu,1589477389.0,The sire was a bay with the white stripe looking color around his barrel (not sure what to call that) his stats were slightly better than the dam’s. I was expecting something different but from the Dam’s side that color pattern always gets thrown but not the actual color.
AskReddit,fqmfw0x,t1_fqmfjan,1589476772.0,I think the best thing to do after reading these comments is to lower the windows and cut the seatbelt off of her as quickly as possible. My car seat is really easy to detach but I think getting her out would be best. If there’s a better way someone can definitely educate me on it. Hopefully it never happens though.
Parenting,fqme4l9,t3_gjlpf9,1589475942.0,"I feel like the worst mom when I put the tv on. My husband is military so it’s usually just me and my daughter. She’s still very young so I try not to do over 1 hour a day. Sometimes I just need a break to clean,cook, or eat."
AskReddit,fqm9hs0,t1_fqm62k3,1589473764.0,When you go in it you can’t really tell you’re underwater but just knowing I am makes me extremely anxious. Sometimes people crash IN the tunnel. It’s awful.
AskReddit,fqm57lm,t1_fqm1s9z,1589471709.0,I feel the same way. I’m in VA and we have a few of the underwater tunnels but a long bridge with tons of traffic leads up to them. A lot of accidents happen on them too.
AskReddit,fqm5235,t1_fqm0de3,1589471633.0,"I wouldn’t have even thought of that. Great advice, thank you."
AskReddit,fqlxzam,t1_fqlxia4,1589468107.0,I didn’t know they made those. I’ll probably get one to ease my mind. There have been a few cars that get rear ended off the bridge in the past few years. None of them died but it still makes me have anxiety. Can’t imagine unbuckling a rear facing car seat with the car in deep water.

AskReddit,fqlvtzq,t1_fqlh7vz,1589467008.0,One of my strange fears is my car going into the water. I have a daughter in a car seat so the thought freaks me out. We have a lot of bridges with tunnels in my state.

thisisus,fq9epri,t3_ghizvl,1589195836.0,Between Jack and Rebecca I’d say Rebecca. There has been a decent amount about how she went on after he died but all we have for Jack are the memories and aftermath of that. Of course that’s a huge part of the show but I think Rebecca’s story is shown more.

unpopularopinion,fmk26y5,t3_fvo2f7,1586142768.0,I agree with this. But I believe it is definitely an unpopular opinion. My husband works a lot long hours so when he plays video games I enjoy watching him play. It makes him happy and sometimes I just do my own thing while he is playing. He loves it when I watch him play and I’m not sure why but I try to do it if the game is interesting enough.

I feel like they built up so much for Kate’s story only to give us maybe an episode and a half about the old boyfriend. I’d also enjoy seeing more on Toby.
thisisus,fl5yqii,t3_fmnuik,1584849282.0,I find myself thinking “Randall please just stop” all the time when I’m watching because he’s just acting so anxious and controlling of those around him. I get what they are trying to do with it and I’m not judging his character having anxiety but why does every episode focus so much on it?

GenderCritical,fl2vjq3,t1_fl2tkyh,1584761030.0,I never watched porn and I’m 28. I just don’t see the interest in watching strangers have sex or do sexual things. I guess I’m the odd one out.

oldpeoplefacebook,fkgc57l,t1_fkg59fe,1584155445.0,That group is so toxic!! I’m also in it and find it interesting to read the arguments. They like to post obese dogs which is sad.
thebachelor,fjgz5pe,t1_fjg97sy,1583338371.0,The issue in this situation is that if they have children and want child support then ruining their husband’s career will not benefit anyone. They could also lose health insurance and other benefits the military gives their children. Everyone handles these things differently so it’s up the to wife what they want to do. I think cheating is unforgivable but if I have a child I’d want to be able to give them what they need.

thebachelor,fjfn1am,t1_fjf9hy2,1583295251.0,That makes sense. It would probably ruin their husband’s career in the military. I’m near the area and a huge percentage are navy or Air Force.
Advice,fioq5le,t3_f8ynvq,1582588404.0,If these cats have not been spayed/neutered please get that done. You don’t need them breeding and needing to find even more homes for these animals. You should post them online with a rehoming fee. If the roommate has 2 cats you and your GF should probably only have 1 or 2 yourselves. It’s unhealthy for that many cats to live together in a home. They are territorial and are probably marking all over the place since they are trying to claim the house. You should have a serious talk with her. Having that many animals is stressful. It’s hard to find them homes because of the emotional attachment but everyone will be happier in the end if you do this.
SuicideWatch,fi7hi70,t3_f6pd79,1582221488.0,Please encourage her to see a therapist. It sounds like you are doing everything in your power to help her but she really needs some professional help as well. I’ve been in the situation where I had to be admitted to a hospital for being suicidal and it was a real wake up call for me to try to get better. A lot of the time when people are suicidal they don’t think it can ever get better so they need some help seeing that it can be a reality.
agt,fi5j714,t1_fhztiii,1582164303.0,I read that they were inspired by The Kingz somewhere. They are pretty similar and both great dance groups.
SuicideWatch,fh6z2ke,t3_f1k2e1,1581309852.0,This may be a good opportunity for you to get away from the abuse and try to start having a life away from your mom. It may be healthier for you to have distance. Having an apartment paid for is something many people would love to have done for them. Take advantage of the situation for your own gain.
Equestrian,fh6yizq,t3_f1bsci,1581309415.0,"When I was in high school there was a “horse girl”   stereotype but luckily they didn’t say awful things like you’re describing. I did find out a lot of guys had hopes of having sex with any of the girls that ride horses at our school. Some of my male friends admitted they heard sex with a horseback rider was better (I mean I don’t think they are wrong!) so it was cooler among the guys to get laid with one of those girls. I don’t even want to watch that Netflix show, the description just turned me off."
thisisus,fh6wsvh,t1_fh6o6rv,1581308118.0,I think both look unhealthy when you see the extreme of each side. The thing you don’t see anorexic people as often as you may see a morbidly obese person in public. In my personal experience I’ve only seen 2 people that may have been obviously anorexic but I see obese people every time I go out in public.

relationship_advice,fegf9vb,t3_ep0jv3,1579090780.0,I think that he will need to decide what is best for him. You expressed your concerns with him and hopefully his other friends will too. She seems controlling and might have a lot of insecurities but it isn’t an excuse to isolate him. There is nothing wrong with having friends of the opposite sex. I’d just let him know you’re there for him if he ever needs to talk. Hopefully if she is manipulating him he realizes this and leaves the relationship.
