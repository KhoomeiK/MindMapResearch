AskReddit,fk0ad09,t3_ffjnii,1583749543.0,"It was a very weird thing and I still don't know what happened or why. I had this friend group, we were 3 couples. But when I broke up with my boyfriend they supported me, and we were still close friends. My ex and I weren't on bad terms, we ended it in a mature way and without any fighting. I just didn't actively tried to stay friends with my ex, and they didn't really stay in touch with him much.

So about 10 months after my ex I got a new boyfriend. They got along pretty quickly and we hung out a few times. Then the weird stuff started. They didn't invite us for the annual New Years party (we hung out each year). So they hung out with the four of them without us. We were both sick so we didn't really mind, but it did strike me as odd. They didn't know we were sick. 

Two months later they went to an amusement park. Didn't invite us. 

I was looking for a job for months. When I finally got a job (customer service) on of my ""friends"" from the group laughed and told me it wasn't a real job. After months sitting at home that really hurt.

I knew it was really over when my grandma died and none of them cared, not even a text with condolences.

A month later we got invited for a barbecue as if nothing happened in the past months. I blocked all of them on social media, deleted their phone numbers. I never heard a thing, so I guess they didn't care about me after all.

After all these years I still wonder sometimes why, if they maybe didn't like my new boyfriend after all, but he never did anything wrong. He's a social guy who easily talks to anyone, is passionate about video games and loves animals. He wouldn't hurt a fly. 

Boyfriend is now upgraded to husband. I now choose my friends wisely."

She didn't tell us she wasn't allowed, and none of us knew.

When she came home her mother FLIPPED. It was the middle of the night but she went to the birthday girl's house and demanded an explanation. Apparently F told her mom we FORCED her to pluck her eyebrows, and the birthday girl's parents held her down or something. She was so afraid of her own mom that she made up this ridiculous story.

Next monday the birthday girl told us what happened. F insisted we forced her. We were all done with her after that.
