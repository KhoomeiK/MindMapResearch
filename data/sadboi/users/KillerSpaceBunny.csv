[https://www.facebook.com/TheSpareTheRodRevolution/notes](https://www.facebook.com/TheSpareTheRodRevolution/notes)

&#x200B;

They are collected and presented by the school they are from. I add more and more all the time. I'm also working on a book called Spare the Rod which will hopefully feature some of these and some interviews with former staff, students, etc. The goal is to get media pressure and political pressure to force politicians to change the laws or enforce them to protect other kids and teens from the kids of things we faced. There's also some other people who want these testimonies like the people at 

\#BreakingCodeSilence [https://www.breakingcodesilence.net/](https://www.breakingcodesilence.net/)"
troubledteens,fnhgllk,t1_fn0xp9r,1586962018.0,Thank you for being brave and sharing this with me. I'd like to add your testimony to the testimonies I have. Would you like me to keep your name anonymous or can you provide it for me and the years you attended?
troubledteens,fnhg8zh,t1_fnaepij,1586961829.0,Awesome! Thank you! It's not easy getting people to take a look at this and act against Agape and Circle of Hope but hopefully we can get some action on these two places.
troubledteens,fnhg5ve,t1_fn984rb,1586961782.0,Awesome! Thank you! I appreciate it! Hopefully with enough testimonies and witnesses collected we can get something done. Its tough. Not gonna lie. But  its worth a shot!
troubledteens,fnhg0tm,t1_fn0nl3m,1586961704.0,"This subreddit is about corrupt troubled teen programs, boarding schools, wilderness programs etc. If you aren't here to talk about that you are in the wrong spot."
troubledteens,fnhfxc3,t1_fn19fhr,1586961651.0,Lets not compare trauma. That is never a good conversation. We are all here together as a group of survivors who have all been through horrible shit we shouldn't have gone through. Lets join forces to end these places or demand they are held to higher standards. I am the raindrop but together we are the ocean!

troubledteens,fn0e76b,t1_fmzk0ec,1586540307.0,"Hey, believe me, I've been trying to get this place shut down for decades. It's tough but we have a shot here. Some things are happening. People are coming forward more and more. Momentum is building. Gotta take advantage of it. Email me your testimony we can work together on getting some light shed on this place! Much love! Stay strong! I know what it's like. I still have the night terrors and memories sometimes."

The main things I'm concerned with are staff you remember and how they treated the students. Did they physically, verbally, mentally abuse them? How? Were you abused? How? Did you have access to a trained and licensed on campus medical staff? What kind of work crews and work did you do there? And of course your personal story and testimony. I'm sorry you had to go through that. I was there 1999-2003. I have a messed up back, PTSD, MDD, anxiety, and night terrors I work through. Thank you for being brave and speaking up!"

troubledteens,flanqen,t1_fkvp9v0,1584987505.0,Email sent with links to testimonies I've gathered from over 45 people who went to Agape and some links to stuff about Agape.
troubledteens,fkvohi7,t3_fkw086,1584573410.0,I am a survivor of Agape Boys Boarding School and know others. I could ask them.
troubledteens,fk8gx4h,t3_fgwqru,1583955817.0,This place doesn't allow bullying or shills to shill. If you want share you story. Many have. If someone is abusive towards you report them and the mods will take care of it.
Sciatica,fk4jlgw,t1_fk4im2z,1583861736.0,"Exactly. That's where I'm at. The disc itself has fallen out and is pinching the nerve roots. The disc above it is bulging slightly. The hip is also showing signs of arthritis and weakness. He wants to do the fusion to support that area so it doesn't have more issues with disc down the line. The only other option is to have them open me up, do another lamenectomy, remove more disc, but then they may have to do that again."
Sciatica,fk4j6yc,t1_fk3av2f,1583861506.0,"All the above for years. Nothing works for longer than a week maybe two max and not all the pain is gone. I just got signed up with a pain management group through my doc. I've tried acupuncture, chiropractic, massage, physical therapy, etc. Right now I'm pretty limited how much I can move without being in a lot of pain."
troubledteens,fk14dor,t3_ff7xcc,1583772162.0,Home wasnt grear for me either. My dad and I fought constantly. I was adopted. Never felt like I fit in. Was sent away at 14. So I spent 14-18 in programs. I have completely lost touch with my brothers and sisters and my parents and I are still struggling to even talk to each other. Im sorry you are going through all of this. I really do recommend a therapist even just to vent to and see where it goes. Cant hurt.
troubledteens,fk143sg,t3_ff7xcc,1583772000.0,"I'm 34 and still dealinga with it. I dealt with my memories and problems wrong. I have chronic pain and choose to drink or party it away way too much in my 20s. I know I sound like an old man but therapy and not drinking my problems away has really been helping me. I have PTSD, MDD, and anxiety. My sciatic nerve roots are pinched from a fissured disc; my L5/S1. Pretty painful stuff. Still trying to forgive my parents and get last the night terrors. I know I should have gotten over it but havent been able to."
troubledteens,fjw3mjc,t3_ff5vse,1583634209.0,Oops. Meant to post that elsewhere. My bad.
troubledteens,fjv9u89,t1_fjnil7b,1583624660.0,Exactly. No regulations. People who aren't licensed in various areas of health and safety. Shit could get ugly fast. We have the highest mortality rate of any nation atm. 4.7% and more and more people keep dieing Washington state. Not super worried but if people have breathing problems already they should be careful. I have sleep apnea.

troubledteens,fjbx0oy,t1_fjbwwtk,1583203300.0,Very painfully aware of this from my own experience.
troubledteens,fj5l5fx,t3_fbjvsg,1583035473.0,Interesting.
troubledteens,fj4gzhn,t3_fatqfr,1583008047.0,"I was in Agape Boarding School. It wasn't a wilderness program but I was there for 3 1/2 years. I have had a fissured disc pinching my L5/S1 nerve roots. I have sciatica and have for 16 years. It sucks. I think its from all the hard labor we did there. We rebuilt the school ourselves after a tornado wiped it out in 2002. 

I'm sorry to hear about your knees. This is a common occurrence for these types of programs. I talk to and see testimonies from people all the time with chronic pain. We need stronger laws protecting kids and teens in these programs."
troubledteens,fj4c4wx,t3_fb80ix,1583004889.0,"So what's the investment based off of, bleeding parents dry and abusing their ""assets"" the kids?"
Sciatica,fipluht,t1_fikzmgp,1582611147.0,Unfortunately not really. A little bit months later but its worse than before. Some of my disc that was left fell out and is pinching the L5/S1 nerve roots. I unfortunately cant do much these days. Waiting on a possinle disc replacement and spinal fusion. Weighing my options and trying to lose weight. Cant even excercise atm.
troubledteens,fhwdnsb,t1_fhh0cym,1581912971.0,Exactly what it feels like. A punch to the gut. It feels terrible that they can't acknowledge what they did or how it effected me and don't understand my pain. The sequence above is spot on. It's exactly the steps they take in conversations to get out of taking responsibility for anything.
troubledteens,fhwdk7f,t1_fhrxmby,1581912892.0,They are trying to avoid responsibility any way they can. They know they messed me up but they want to either blame it on me or make up something like RAD since they can't face the fact that the boys home and boarding school gave me PTSD that is most likely there for the rest of my life. They want to change my perception on things and it isn't going to work.
troubledteens,fhra2mp,t1_fhr275m,1581821081.0,Thank you!

troubledteens,fhg6nal,t3_f31i8b,1581559806.0,She's even trying to say she thinks I have R.A.D. and not PTSD. She says the symptoms are similar and that because I was adopted out of a chaotic situation where my dad killed my mom and put in foster care for a short time and then into their care that I might actually have R.A.D.. Sounds like she hasn't learned anything. I'm going to most likely pull back and not talk to them as much. It's sad. I've done everything I can to show them information on the topic and they just give me excuses. They wanted me to think they are being more understanding but they just aren't.
troubledteens,fhfydj5,t1_fhbm7s6,1581554253.0,"True. Fakers are easy to spot. People who haven't survived what we have don't see it the same. Hell, some people have survived it and are still brainwashed. Either way you can tell"
troubledteens,fhbrwsa,t1_fg5x8dt,1581448586.0,"I have to agree here. Keep your head low. Get signed up into whatever you can to avoid her so you two don't fight. I had a similar experience with counselors that always took my parents side and twisted things against me. It turned me away from counseling for a very long time and that didn't help me in the end, it only caused my mental health issues to get worse. Just try to realize this will pass. This is temporary. You can get a better counselor. They aren't all like this. Things will get better. It will take time but they will.

There are also subreddit mental health links in the WIKI if you are interested! There are some great threads and groups where people discuss depression, anxiety, PTSD, and other mental health issues. I've found them to be very helpful. I have MDD, PTSD, anxiety, and chronic pain."
troubledteens,fhbqsh8,t1_fgvqy4j,1581447897.0,I can't find anything specifically but I know he has suggested many abusive places including a Turnabout Ranch.
troubledteens,fhbpz2x,t3_exdi3u,1581447404.0,So basically dope them with date rape like drugs so they can't act out. That's fucked!
troubledteens,fhboeqi,t1_fhboa39,1581446462.0,Our legal system is a bad joke. It really has many flaws and needs a lot of work.
troubledteens,fhbnrew,t1_fh01jes,1581446076.0,Those people are almost ALWAYS in the pocket of someone. Someone pays them for their reviews. I've tried to go on these educational consultant sites and they won't even listen to me or take my review of Agape.
troubledteens,fhbnnpj,t3_f0k12f,1581446014.0,"I know at Agape Boarding School none of my teachers were licensed or had educational degrees including my principle and you could tell. They advertise they have counseling and that their program is great for kids with ADHD and ADD but then when you get there they tell you those things are all in your head, made-up, not real and what your really need to do is a bunch of manual labor for them."
troubledteens,fhbmy6v,t3_exnnzn,1581445595.0,"I'm from Bend. I'd be very interesting in sharing your story on my Spare The Rod Facebook page [www.facebook.com/T](https://www.facebook.com/SpareTheRod)heSpareTheRodRevolution and including it in my eventual book of stories like this. I've been collecting a ton of testimonies from people from different programs and plan to put them all in a book then use the books money to fund private investigators and lobbyists to take down the corrupt Troubled Teen Industry once and for all.

Keep fighting! Never give up! We are with you in that fight! Stay strong!"
troubledteens,fhbmgql,t3_exsoao,1581445308.0,"You have to understand, many of us are survivors. We still are pretty upset about the things w'eve experienced in similar programs. Asking us in this way provokes anger. If you were to ask us ""Is Discovery Ranch a good program?"" We would refer you to the WIKI's list of programs that we've flagged as abusive or tell you straight up it isn't. If you looked through this thread you would find stories and posts about Discovery Ranch. There's a lot of info on the web. A lot of us are pretty upset with our parents about not doing more research before they sent us to the places they sent us that traumatized us. Just be careful with your words. I'm not going to go as far as some people on here to assume your intent. Maybe you really are concerned for your son. If you are you should definitely pull him immediately. He is in danger!"
troubledteens,fhblq5r,t1_fhbljw4,1581444870.0,True. Hmmm. Well I'm all for brainstorming on this one. I think maybe a spreadsheet would be a good start. Break it down by city and state. I don't know how you'd vet survivors though. We'd have to think of some sort of system without being too invasive.
troubledteens,fhblaw1,t1_fh6uy3p,1581444616.0,I like this idea! Maybe we could do some voluntary city by city shout out of survivors and advocates? Then those could group together in person if they want? I'll pitch that idea to the mods.
troubledteens,fhbl3qm,t3_f0o07f,1581444497.0,I wish there was one in my hometown of Portland too. Maybe there is and I haven't found it. I appreciate this thread and the people in it though! That really helps me. I look for people going through what I've gone through and just try to be compassionate and understanding. By listening to them and helping them in any way I can and just understanding I'm not alone in this fight I've been able to encourage myself to keep going with therapy and fight back! I hope you can find some of the same in here. We are here to talk if you need a friend. Many people in here have gone through horrible things but we survived and we are like family in here! If I could be there for you in person I would be. I'm sorry you are hurting. Hang in there! Stay strong!
troubledteens,fhbklvs,t3_f0rm5i,1581444199.0,There's also a lot of really good info in the WIKI. Thanks for asking! We welcome anyone who will help us get the word out and advocate against this sort of thing!
troubledteens,fhbkb0c,t3_f0rxei,1581444018.0,"I'm not in Brazil but my experience with U.S. law and law enforcement is there are 38 states with strong religious exemption clauses and laws that allow anyone claiming to run a private, religious based organization to get away with almost anything. In states where these protections don't exist there are transport companies to take kids to state with laxer child abuse laws and religious exemption clauses and laws. These places aren't required to register or be regulated by the state or federal government in many cases making them practically invisible."
troubledteens,fhbixnr,t3_f0nrtt,1581443223.0,"I remember when I found this thread. The feeling was comforting yet saddening. We've been through things we wish no kid or teen would ever have to go through. It's heartbreaking. I hope you find healing and comfort in talking to others here. We are in this together. Together we need to fight against the corrupt #TroubledTeenIndustry or #TTI.

I have PTSD. I went from being non violent to violent too. I understand your pain there. Don't beat yourself up too much. Hopefully you've found a therapist outside of there. Took me a long time to trust therapists. You were assaulted by one. I really feel for you. Finding good help may be difficult but it's worth it. The nightmares are hard to escape. I've had them for years. They are getting a little better with therapy, meds, and I listen to meditation music at night I found on YouTube. Search for Theta Realms or Sleep Music. You should find some that are like 8 hours long. Sometimes that helps for some reason. Maybe it just helps my brain go to a better place. Idk. Hope it helps."
troubledteens,fhb9o02,t3_f117d1,1581437750.0,Go Allen Knoll! He added me on Facebook! Rad! Very excited to see this getting the word out and appreciate his work on this!
troubledteens,fhb7iwx,t1_fha9mlm,1581436460.0,I really like this idea. Maybe we could use the information in the Wiki here about basic standards of care we can enact that will help protect these kids. Maybe we could include the red flag warnings.
troubledteens,fh9y94g,t1_fh98xj1,1581392427.0,Ya. Some programs do that. There are sites too where for example my school Agape Boarding School is praised with all 5 star glowing reviews. In actuality I tried to submit a bad one and they never put it up. So reviews can't always be trusted.
troubledteens,fh91bak,t3_f13abg,1581371644.0,"It's ok. I was almost brainwashed into working for Agape Boarding School. Then when I returned home I even thought about working for my dad's transport business. Eventually I snapped out of it. Probably because I started having nightmares, flash-backs, and my spine broke. Trauma does weird things to our brains. We get Stockholm Syndrome or leap into survival mode. You were just reacting to trauma and a lot of that is practically involuntary."
troubledteens,fh90x60,t3_f1wpf3,1581371406.0,"I've had similar issues with reviews of the program I survived. I'd try again. Maybe someone flagged it and someone didn't like your review so they removed it against their own policies. You can also look to see if they have a Google business location page. I've noticed people don't remove those as often, or a YouTube.."
troubledteens,fh902vs,t3_f15j5s,1581370909.0,I want to thank you for your bravery and coming forward with your story! Together we are strong! I hope you find healing. I hope you find healing and joy in life. Reach out if any of us can help or you just need someone to talk to whose survived similar. Much love!
troubledteens,ffy87jg,t3_evm1ac,1580340464.0,Glad to have been a help! I appreciate this group. It has really helped me feel like I'm not alone and that some of the trauma I've experienced isn't normal or OK. Thanks for this space!

troubledteens,fewea82,t3_eoyrgl,1579409150.0,If anyone can find out if this place has locations open still and where we could write reps in the area and put some pressure on them to act. Might be the straw that breaks that camels back.
Sciatica,feorj77,t3_epr8zk,1579304455.0,"Thanks for the responses. I just want to clarify that I've already had a laminectomy discectomy August 26th. The part of the disc they left in has slipped out and is now pinching the L5/S1 nerve roots. Surgery is considered ""necessary"" to fix it and this is what I've been told by 3 neurosurgeons. The question is how far do I want to take this and I am fishing for people who have had surgeries like this and can comment on how much they have or haven't helped. Thanks!"
Sciatica,feokb0k,t3_eq3oba,1579301390.0,Increased stress has always caused my sciatica to flare more.
Sciatica,feo1892,t1_felhapo,1579293688.0,It got incredibly worse. It's unbearable now. Before I could walk and do some stuff before it would start to hurt. Now I'm pretty much in bed all the time and on pain killers and muscle relaxers.
Sciatica,feo15lr,t1_felixwb,1579293643.0,"I'm definately not basing my decision solely based on Reddit. Lol. I'm smarter than that. I guess i'm just looking for people who have been where I'm at and can speak from experience to help me weight my decision. I'm more or less trying to see what people's experiences with artificial discs, fusions, and spine surgeries have been. Thanks for the reminder though. I appreciate it."

Sciatica,fdpq5ld,t1_fdppg7t,1578636317.0,Ya. I'm already on muscle relaxers and oxy for my pain. Ive regained leg function but if it happens again I'm going to the ER. Calling tomorrow first thing in the morning to see what they think. Thanks.
troubledteens,fdljw7s,t3_elvd13,1578525677.0,Also idk if anyone wants to help them with this http://www.fornits.com/phpbb/index.php?topic=16439.0
troubledteens,fdli73z,t3_elvd13,1578524563.0,Sadly I do not. Have you searched heal-online.org yet? They have program staffer lists available for a lot of programs. Fuzzy memory like that is all part of the effects of trauma. Stay strong! Ive researched that place! OMG is it ever fucked up! Horrible horrific stories. I have them in the notes section on my Spare the Rod Facebook page. www.facebook.com/TheSpareTheRodRevolution. I haven't been on FB much because I'm banned for a stupid meme AGAIN. Sigh. Think I'm done. Just Reddit and Twitter for now. I'll return to manage the page more but with an account FB isn't targeting and censoring the shit out of. But there are testimonies of others there like you in notes. Feel free to send me yours and I'll add it.
troubledteens,fdehq6n,t3_ekeyqx,1578339272.0,"This is absolutely horrific! I'm so sorry you had to go through this! I once watched a kid go insane from Agape Boarding School, the school I was in. He eventually tried to bash his own brains out on the wall and then was sent to a mental institution. I also saw staff badly beat a few students and we weren't allowed to go to a doc when things were wrong either. I can totally feel for you! These places must be shut down! They have no right nor the ability to handle children coming down off drugs or with medical conditions!"
SpareTheRod,fdedl63,t1_fcggxpj,1578336701.0,Yes. This is more focused on at home abuse. If they actually cracked down on TTI or investigated it these numbers would explode! Good point!
disability,fcwkdvh,t3_ej6wp6,1578028029.0,Pad that chair and put a cover for it along with some sound and I'd ride that all over the place annoying people. Lol. I say a cover because I live in Oregon. Lol. That's cool though. Thanks for the share!
Sciatica,fcwjyej,t3_ej4fk8,1578027675.0,"I take 800mg three times a day so 2400 mg a day. Does not help with my sciatic pain too much but I notice if I don't take it and very quickly get side effects. Everything grinds to hault. My brain doesn't want to think, its like I'm hung over but in my head. Sucks. Has done wonders to help me quit alcohol and stay clean though. I wouldn't recommend it especially if you are puking like that. There's always Lyrica but idk if it's any better. I'm actually sort of back to the drawing board myself. Let me know what you and your doc decide on. Feel better!"
pics,fcvtmfb,t3_ej4kv0,1578009826.0,Id much rather look at them than Trump all the time. Lol. That's it! I'm moving! 😂💩☠️👻
troubledteens,fcuwhwc,t3_ehwyyn,1577989946.0," It's a process. Definitely takes time and effort. Everyone is different so it's pretty hard to say anything is a ""fix-all"". I go to therapy weekly and vent. Took me awhile, but once you find the right therapist and can vent to someone who will listen just talking about those memories and how they haunt you over and over again seems to help flush them out, or at least, it helped me. I have night terrors. It took awhile, but with merds and counseling the night terrors are getting better if not going away all together. I use sound therapy at night. I cue up a YouTube video with some low to mid frequency tones and play it in my headphones. Seems to help the night terror. I also try to meditate, not on things that have happened, but rather, on nothing. Just sitting and deep breathing thinking about nothing really helps me sometimes. Hope this helps and you find your peace! It's hard man I know! Much love!"
troubledteens,fcunvty,t3_ehvbsd,1577984989.0,"Thanks for the insight. I'm working on a book project called Spare the Rod. There's a lot of stuff even in the school I went to Agape Boarding School, that at times feels as though it was well intentioned but that they didn't consider the social or physical abuse aspects from an informed perspective. In other words they had no idea the impact it could have later or simply didn't care and were trying to cover it up."
troubledteens,fcunhks,t3_eilv3a,1577984761.0,"Yes. Unfortunately I have my entire adult life because of my sciatica (low back nerve pain in back and leg), PTSD, Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), and sleep problems (sleep apnea, night terrors, loss of sleep due to pain, etc.). It's really sucked. I've applied for disability three times now. I'm in-between my 2nd spinal surgery since August 26th of this year, when I got my first. It's a mess. For years I didn't have any real family support either. Now, luckily, I found the other side of my family I was estranged from and a cousin is helping me. He is disabled and working and it makes me feel like even more shit that I'm not puling my weight. I know exactly the fear, feeling, and have struggled hard over the years to hold down jobs. The longest I've ever been employed was like a year and a half."
troubledteens,fcun07q,t1_fcuftnr,1577984482.0,"Oof. That is a rough position you are in. I'm very sorry to hear that. I was in that position as a child. I was out of control. I wasn't drinking or doing drugs but I was doing other things that I shouldn't have been and my father and I would yell and scream at each other constantly. My mom was the one that I think didn't want me sent away but my father, if you can call him that, was the one that really wanted me gone and out of the way. He never liked me. 

How is his relationship with his mom other than her wanting to send him away for just about anything? Does he still enjoy time with her or is he almost completely shut off when it comes to her and hanging out with her? How bad is the drinking may I ask? Is it blackout drinking, just a few here and there? I also struggled with drinking and drinking and smoking were the hardest things for me to quit. 

I actually take Gabapentin daily. It's for my back as I have sciatica and nerve pain and damage in my low back and leg. Funny enough it was originally prescribed to help me quit drinking. It wasn't an overnight cure but I noticed the cravings starting going away and then after awhile I was able to stop drinking with almost no cravings ever. Only every once in awhile would I get the cravings. I also replaced booze with sugary drinkings because it replaces the sugar in the beer or mixed drink and part of your cravings are actually sugar induced. These are things that can help him but he would have to be willing of course. 

I think the best thing you can do is try any way you can to connect with your son. Let him know you understand and do your best to do that without judging him or coming down on him for every mistake he opens up to you about. He's got some pain in there most likely he is trying to numb or bad friends. Either way, the source is what you are looking for. Once identified you can work on it with him if he will let you."
SpareTheRod,fcteuk1,t3_eithog,1577941010.0,"Hi! Thanks for sharing. Just had a few questions if you don't mind? Is it a lock-down facility or are you allowed to come and go as you please? Do they screen your mail and/or phone calls or conversations in or out? Do you have on-site medical staff in case there is an emergency; someone like a nurse or doctor? Do you have access to one quickly should a student be injured and require medical attention? Are they attentive to your needs or neglectful? Thanks. Just working on getting more info on places like this. I help out here on troubled teens and I run my own page [www.reddit.com/r/SpareTheRod](https://www.reddit.com/r/SpareTheRod). Hope you can get through this rough time in your life soon and once it's past you live a fuller, happier, more fulfilling life! I am a survivor myself. not of this place but a different one."
troubledteens,fct2yvo,t3_eil33z,1577931522.0,"The Wiki here has some links for mental health and addiction subreddits that may or may not help. I don't have any experience in this matter, but I have heard this story a few times. It is in your best interest and the kids to keep him out of a TTI. He will most likely only get worse if thrown in one especially this late in his teenage life. He may even decide not to talk to you two for a long time or never again. It will only drive him to drink more not less. Change like this must happen because someone wants it. Whats his underlying psychological issues ATM?! Is he struggling with depression, anxiety, or suicidal thoughts? Have you and him seen a counselor either together or perhaps separate? Maybe if something is bothering him and you are able to level with him and he believes he can trust you (NO LIES!) then you'd get somewhere; a lot farther than if he gets sent away. I wish you the best luck."
troubledteens,fckobbd,t3_eho6qp,1577729660.0,"So I keep trying to submit a review here for Agape Boarding School and it never lets me lol. [https://www.privateschoolreview.com/agape-boarding-school-profile](https://www.privateschoolreview.com/agape-boarding-school-profile)

I've found that Agape is doing this kind of manipulation with Google and other services."
troubledteens,fcknx6l,t3_ehotcb,1577729417.0,Because some people feel the need to demonize others for their choices so they can secretly feel better about their own. They should both be reasonably priced or free and if life saving it should be like the ER where you can't be turned away and can be billed.
troubledteens,fcgxx4z,t1_fcd58vw,1577645147.0,That's awesome! Thanks for being awesome.

depression,fc4d5pt,t3_efl9rl,1577413231.0,After over 2 years of counseling and meds (something I didn't think I'd ever do tbh) I am actually doing a lot better and I'm not having those waves of depression. Are you on any meds? I take Viibryd. It seems to work really well. I start to get the depressed thoughts very seldom but there isn't feeling attached to it. I recommend asking your psychiatrist or prescribing doctor to do a DNA test to see what meds you absorb and metabolize the best. I tried a whole bunch of meds before finding the combo I am on right now. Really wish they had had that test sooner. Hope this helps. One other thing. Lookup mindful meditation. It's basically just meditation where you don't meditate on anything. You just focus on your breathing and maybe count your breaths. You allow your mind to blank out while you do some deep breaths for a bit. I have found if I can get myself out of my depression spiral just enough to close my eyes and do some deep breathing it really really helps.
depression,fc4cshv,t3_efp407,1577412933.0,Hey buddy. I have Major Depressive Disorder or MDD with PTSD and anxiety. I also deal with chronic spinal pain on a daily basis. I know how you feel. Depression is a hard fought battle and people say they understand but unless they have clinical depression or a disorder they really don't. I hope you are ok. My suggestion is take a long walk in a park somewhere or forest with trees. Just get away from people and cars and the city for a sec. If you can't that's fine. Throw some headphones on and listen to something peaceful. Close your eyes and focus just on your breathing counting your breath in and out in and out in and out. That usually helps me calm the whirlwind of depressing thoughts long enough to find something to distract myself with. Get your mind off of whatever is bothering you. If you can't solve the problem don't dwell on it. I'm around if you need a person to talk to that gets it. Feel better soon. Hope this helps.
depression,fc4bz72,t3_efyemj,1577412271.0,"I'm not really sure. I have Major Depressive Disorder, PTSD, and anxiety. People constantly treat them all like they are ""just in my head""; and they are but that doesn't mean they aren't real. I think people assume too much about others often. So they assume since they have felt depressed before that they understand it and confuse the mood with an actual disorder. I grew up with really abusive parents and in an abusive boys home then boarding school and was told to ""get over it"", ""stop crying or I'll give you something to cry about"", called a girl for having emotions or made fun of and told to just ""get over it"". People like that either don't know what to say and feel awkward so they say that thinking the tough love will help or are just abusive assholes. Either way pay no attention to them as hard as that can be. Just focus on breathing, maybe meditate, sleep, get out of whatever toxic environment you are in for a bit and just clear your head. Going for a walk sometimes helps me. Gotta get away from all the horrible humans and get out in nature for a few minutes."
SuicideWatch,fc3kkmz,t1_fc3kfmd,1577391870.0,>Yep agreed.
SuicideWatch,fc3kb6m,t3_efrofy,1577391687.0,"Just recently down the street from me a man committed ""suicide by cop"". He was homeless, had PTSD, and someone called the cops on him a couple week back. The first time they were able to get him to a hospital. The 2nd time he was wielding a knife in the middle of the street. Cops shot and killed him."
pics,fc3k5l1,t3_efvd4o,1577391576.0,Love it! I stopped drinking 6 months ago and stopped smoking a year ago! Haven't looked back! This is a great idea to pass the time and learn.
ChronicPain,fc3d56m,t1_fc2r8hf,1577387163.0,I have a herniated disc L5/S1 nerve roots are pinched. Had a laminectomy discectomy August 26th. Surgery failed and part of the disc needs to be removed so another surgery  is coming although idk when  I've been like this for months on and off steroids and now pain meds. Currently on oxycodone. Had to fight like Hell to get them and they short me all the time by not giving me enough for the frequency I'm taking them. Everyone looks at me and treats me like a junkie  Idk how I'm even managing this level of pain let alone all the shade people throw me. It's ridiculous!
Sciatica,fc3ckie,t3_efyqot,1577386804.0,That's what I've been told. I was in physical therapy before surgery. Had a laminectomy discectomy August 26th. It failed and the disc is reherniated but a couple of times I was able to get the pain centralized around the disc itself. Never stayed that way though sadly. I'd talk to your doc or physical therapist. Let them know. They should be able to help more.
troubledteens,fc3c5bf,t1_fc359gh,1577386537.0, My therapist is all for it if it will help. He admittedly doesn't know much about it. He is more into mindfulness and meditation stuff like that. I'll mention it again next session and see what he says.
troubledteens,fc32ub9,t1_fc32jge,1577380151.0,"No that's exactly what my counselor said. He said some relationships just aren't salvageable and although I want to have a good relationship with my dad I should be aware of the negative impact it has on my mental health constantly dealing with him and mom. I decided to stop talking to them all together. I wasn't really talking with Bill just Chris, my mom. I stopped that too because she is just as guilty and in denial. It's really sad. My mom will do anything that man says. She's your 1950's style house wife. She would always turn a blind eye when I was being choked out or when dad hit me or abused me. I'd ask if she saw it and she'd lie and say she didn't then go cry about it."
troubledteens,fc32gat,t1_fc328cw,1577379906.0,"Right?! Set aside the fact it looks like 1999 called and wants their website back, the amount of narcissism and denial really shines though. But yep...that's my adopted ""dad"". We don't speak and haven't in many years."
troubledteens,fc319k2,t1_fc30pn6,1577379162.0,Agreed! Thanks for this! I've been seeing the same therapist for about a year and a half and it is something we have talked about but not yet tried. I think I might given your review. I mean...why not right?! Thanks again!
troubledteens,fc310a5,t1_fc30a2f,1577378988.0,"Oh believe  me you will not offend me at all for calling them what they are! Bill is a terrible person and as very abusive verbally, mentally, even physically. He used to choke me out and say horrible things like my mom being murdered by my dad was my fault for being born and how he didn't want to adopt me but my mom made him because my bio mom was her sister. Just terrible shit. He is a PO. Here's a link to their business page. Some people on here no doubt may have even met him or one of his employees. [www.touchdowninc.com](https://www.touchdowninc.com) I'm trying to get his business shutdown. I've tried reporting it all kinds of public officials and the media without any luck."
