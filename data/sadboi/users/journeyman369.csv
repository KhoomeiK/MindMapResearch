I've been to Nicaragua many times before, and what is happening there is heartbreaking and highly disturbing. The country is under the thumb of an insane sadist with an equally crazy and ""esoteric"" wife who also calls the shots. 

I bet that Sandino himself is rolling in his grave right now with what this unhinged lunatic is doing to the country. I'm also sure that if Sandino were alive today he'd have that dictator hanged, drawn, and quartered for all to see. He's killing the people out of sheer sadism, and his brainwashed followers are in some sick form of denial and compliance. It's what horror stories are made of - worthy of a Stephen King novel.

CR has the infection contained and things would be catastrophic if visitors are allowed in. The pandemic must be contained all over the world, not just in a handful of countries. It's not even a risk - it's a death sentence for CR if it opens its doors to visitors.

If people from countries like the US (especially there) want to come here for whatever reason, they must first understand that their travel plans mean absolutely nothing when it comes to protecting lives, and if they're not allowed in, then they should wait as long as it takes.

The best thing to do is to stay home and look after your own before trying to come here. People are getting infected and dying by the thousands every day, all over the world."

It's highly disturbing and worrisome to see how many of you are making big plans to come here disregarding the fact that there are hundreds if not thousands of infections in your own countries on a daily basis.

Perhaps many of you tourists think that since Costa Rica depends on tourism, it will allow you back in as soon as possible for your personal pleasure. Well your personal pleasure means nothing.

Don't bet on it. Costa Rica will open its borders to international tourism once the infections are contained, and this could very well take much longer than June 15. The government would be silly to reopen the borders so soon when countries like the US (especially the US) are getting tons of infections on a daily basis. I'd give it a few more months at the very least.

If you want to come over and visit, I strongly suggest that you don't try to rush it. And it doesn't matter what type of tourist you are. This virus is insidious and does not discriminate.
