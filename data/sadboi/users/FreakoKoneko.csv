As for piercings, we aren't allowed to have any facial piercings, which really fucking sucks. I loved my cheek piercings SO much! And a little after I got them(when k was still in hs) I had to get the redone because of a stupid chorus concert.(the holes closed up). So, I had these wonderful piercings done TWICE, which lead to a bit of scaring and keloids, and then I had to take them out? For a dollar store? But being the edgy and educated teen I was, I tried to use retainers which were too big apparently and I ended up making my cheeks bleed but it was okay because ""they looked better""?
