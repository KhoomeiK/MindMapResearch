getdisciplined,eyx7bvv,t1_eyx6muk,1567546440.0,"> Say what you want, but doing NoFap really helped. I don't think any guy should be sitting inside and jerking off to porn daily or even a few times a week. Lifting and eating well also helped give me the energy to hike, get up early, and get done what I had planned for the day.

> To sum it all up, everything I did was focused on getting out of my comfort zone. Lifting is not comfortable. Approaching people you don't know isn't comfortable. Going places yourself like restaurants and state parks alone isn't comfortable. All of these things do pay off in the end however.

That's what I want to change in my life right now as well.
