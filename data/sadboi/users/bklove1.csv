I get ready to go in and fight to the teeth about my pain. Surgeon walks in, glances at my MRI, and is like ""oh, you have a compression"". My neurosurgeon said that radiologists looks for things like tumors on the trigeminal nerve, and neurosurgeons are better at detecting blood vessels causing the problem. I was extremely lucky that my compression was visible on an MRI because that's not usually the case. He even recommended me MVD in the same sitting as him diagnosing me, lol. He's great.
