Next morning we got ready (YouTube tutorial for the hair and DIY Makeup) and met up with our photographer (who was doing it for free since she's new to this and I promised to help her cause I'm a photographer). Took pictures for two hours, then we took a break at home to put ourselves back together and had a cup of tea before meeting with our close family at the courthouse, where we had our short ceremony and champagne reception. Then we all drove to the restaurant together to eat lunch and had coffee and dessert. And that was it, super short and easy but still cozy and nice and cute.

I can get hurt by him same chances as by anybody else. Even I could hurt him. I don't want to and I try to believe he does not want to hurt me either. And if we wanna continue our path and that's the way we chose to do it, let's go I guess. I think there's a GIANT stigma associated with not leaving a cheater. But tbh that's a mistake people make, just like so many others. And if the BS thinks they're strong enough and both are willing to carry on and learn from that: That's possibly a stronger point than in many other relationships. You go!

Anxiety,fh3wqhp,t1_fh3tt9y,1581273043.0,"Yes I really could not leave the house for a minute. I got myself a dog then. I was at home anyways and the dog made me force myself to go out. Into the garden. For a tiny walk through the neighborhood. To the first car drives for a lake nearby. People approached me and made comments on my puppy. Which made me learn to talk to strangers again. And so on. Tiny steps, but for me it was huge. I have suffered from anxiety and chronic recedive depression for 10 years now, I'm 26 today. I work (but as a self-employed photographer, so I only have a few days of work each month), I have two dogs, I have a great partner, I can go grocery shopping and manage life like a nearly normal person. But you know what? I still often feel lonely, depressed, different from everyone else (the job thing is huge for me, I'd LOVE to work a regular, well-paid job, but that's potentially never going to happen because of my anxiety). I try to adapt, I remind myself how far I've come, what I achieved in life. It may be different from a normal, healthy person, but still it's not small! For someone with difficulties even a small achievement can be huge! And think about it: living inside, in constant fear, somewhat isolated weighs so hard on you but still you move on! You long for help, you fight to get better! You go! That's strong and a big step and even that you have never given up on you is a great thing. You open up to me, you talk about your fear, that's a thing most adult 'normal achievers' struggle with."
Anxiety,fh3qah0,t1_fh2v1gl,1581271245.0,"I have GAD, too, hypochondria, social anxiety and a very specific anxiety/panic reaction when it comes to work situations. I have the german equivalent of A-Levels, started studies and also educations in various fields and never got to finish any of it because I never could stand any criticism. ""You didn't do perfect"" brought me (and still brings me) to tears, because I feel judged and never good enough. I feel like I have to have control over everything in my life (my body, chores, doing enough, caring enough, doing things right or as I pictured them, perfectly) and I know that I will probably never fulfill my own standards. I can't let go of ANYTHING. I feel in charge, I need to be in charge. Had the same problem with meds (fear of losing control over my body, my weight, my emotions or thoughts, fear of not being real) but I simply had to see that I couldn't go on the way it was. I felt bad from waking up until I went to bed, I stressed out over everything, my body really hurt from all the tension I put upon myself. So I saw different therapists until one felt right, I tried to open up as best as I could and tried to learn and tried my hardest to let them help me (I didn't like the thought of needing help but I knew I really did). I found a psychiatrist I felt like I could put trust in, told him about all my fears about medication, let him educate me about the risks, what it would feel like, what SHOULD happen and also what could happen. Tried one medication I really didn't feel comfortable with, told him, tried another one that finally made me feel better. Let people help you. Reach out, try to trust, talk about what you need and what does not feel right for you. And try, even try things that initially don't feel good for a few weeks. Give things time and chances, it will be worth it."

CheatedOn,fgi7gnj,t3_eyba4b,1580809571.0,The only thing that matters for this question to be answered should be your feeling towards him. If you still love him and think there are ways to fix this and both WANT to work it out you can. If the hurt makes you resentful and questioning everything etc. If it's not just that it's time to let go. But in my opinion it's not just black and white or 'nobody deserves second chances'. Relationships are tough on both. It's your own decision what you are willing to take and do.

But when I look back I see the progress I made. Which seems like NOTHING and baby steps compared to other people. But why compare? See, Depression is an illness. It hinders you from doing so many things. Would I compare 2 persons ability to run up the stairs and take one perfectly healthy person and one with COPD? Why on earth would I do that, it would be an unfair, sick comparison. Yet I do compare myself to people that don't suffer from Depression, saying 'I'll never achieve this and that like them.'

Well, maybe I won't. But maybe that's ok because I didn't choose it to be that way. So I try to stop comparing myself."
dogs,fajh1ht,t3_e9h1ow,1576137356.0,"Hey there :) I totally get the way you're feeling. We have a wonderful two and a half year old Mini Doxie and she's the cutest little sunshine. So we decided she should get a mate last year and got a second Mini Doxie girl and my gosh, this dog is draining me most days. She likes to excessively bark at strangers (some. But there is simply no pattern in who she will choose.) and snap at peoples hands. She will be the nicest dog to our visitors but outside she can be living hell. She doesn't behave on her leash, tries to go at random other dogs (while with others she just plain nicely plays), one time she nearly bit our waitress at a restaurant. There are times when I just wanna leave her at home and go or think about 'just taking the good dog out'. There are days where I feel drained and stress is taking a toll on me and my fianc√©. But I try to remember that nothing in this is her fault. I try to breathe and find a way to just be here with her and find small things that make us both feel good like watching her play in the garden, giving her a chew toy and just chilling next to her, take her into the bathroom with me with her freshly stuffed kong and just taking a nice bath myself. There are always ways to get your own stress levels down and you'll see the dog mirror it, even if it's, just a tiny difference. Keep going, don't give up, don't forget about yourself and your partner. Maybe a nice date night with some movies and ordered food would make you both feel a little less stressed and there would be no separation anxiety for you are home :) Feel free to dm me if there's anything I can help with.

MakeupAddiction,f7rofku,t3_dxjrgh,1573984760.0,"Bangs. I litterally have the same high forehead and getting some long Bangs cut in changed my face completely! Plus: I'm also as pale as a wall, so we can pretty much stick together in that. The Makeup is beautiful, I like it."
Weddingsunder10k,f7rlziq,t3_dxhn7k,1573983591.0,"The common saying is you need to think of about 100‚Ç¨ per person here in Germany, cause you need food and drinks for everybody and a bigger venue the more guests you have. That's why first thing we did was minimizing our guest list so we could get a nice and cozy venue."

Dachshund,f71lc31,t3_dtv4k4,1573343326.0,"Normally as I've heard and experienced Dachshunds get along very well since the dogs from the same breed mostly play very similar. I have two little girls, one ist nearly three years, the younger one just turned one in November. We visited her as a puppy with our big girl and they played and got along really well, that's why we chose her. We make sure to assure the older one as higher in rank (since that's what they show us, but you'll have to look which signs they give you.) But they always get the same and are treated pretty equal. If you have any specific questions feel free to message me. But I'm sure it'll go great ‚ô• best wishes to you and your doxies."
