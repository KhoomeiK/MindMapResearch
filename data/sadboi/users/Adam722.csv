A strong, addictive anxiety medication might be prescribed for severe anxiety, but that will only be for the short term because it’s so addictive. You might not want to take the risk of getting so addicted, so there’s the option of certain antidepressants which are also used to treat anxiety. If you’re anxiety’s bad enough, you might want to combine therapy with your medication if you go that route for maximum results."
