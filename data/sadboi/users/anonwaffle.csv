I always expected that he would OD and I'd find him. So when I got the call that it was a car crash it absolutely destroyed me. That was June. I loved him and still do, but looking back, I should have walked away a long time ago.

GriefSupport,evjknv3,t3_cjcqxj,1564564379.0,"My boyfriend also passed away suddenly in a tragic car accident. June 11th. Every day since then has been...interesting. It doesnt get easier. Just when I think I might be ok, the waves of grief wash over and knock the wind out of me. I feel like I'm hanging on by a thread at times. Seeing others go about their business or moving on seems ridiculous to me until I remember that they're also just trying to get through their day. When people ask me how I'm doing, I usually say I'm ok or I'm fine just to avoid the awkward conversation involving me telling them I'm not ok, all I want to do is scream but the screams are drowned out by the overwhelming sadness I feel. People dont really respond well to that. They probably are having similar feelings and also hiding it. Or maybe they are feeling better and moving on and if that's the case well they're lucky and I hate them.
