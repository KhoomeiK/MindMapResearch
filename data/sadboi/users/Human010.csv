After weeks of quarantine, I've finally caught up to all the video games I hadn't had a chance to play, felt great for a minute, but now as I stare at the void again I feel that old familiar depression rearing its head and I remember all my regrets in this world and why I want out. Thing is though tomorrow gonna be another day, life doesn't stop because you think it does, it just feels like it when you stagnate, so my advice to you is to march forward my dude. You'll get trough this, we'll get trough this, and trough what ever comes after, just keep going forward."
