HonkaiImpact3rd,fb9chhi,t3_eaozfl,1576635020.0,"Well, you can try any other Valkyrie with elemental damage like Flame Sakitama who has high burst fire dmg or Night squire, if you want to go the full damage route and trust on your ability to evade. I would use a creature type for those early waves. Maybe try divine prayer as a support for her global time fracture and for her team heal. I think maybe Sixth Serenade can also freeze it in place. So like, DP, NS, and any of your highest dmg dealing valkyrie, or SS, NS, and a high elemental g Valkyrie."

atheism,f1euufd,t3_d92udz,1569430752.0,"The way I see it, in some churchs they tend cultivate this type of behavior where they believe some parts of the big let are more important than others. Like they go hard on gays but not the fact that they can't eat meat or sushi, I think those are the foods. It's something that is actively done but it is not noticed because it's the pastor's job to preach the word of God and in some cases they believe whatever they talk about is what's going wrong with the church, very subjective. Seeing as they are the sheep, they put their focus on whatever subject matter the pastor says is the problem. Tunnel visioning. 
It can also be that, some people hold stronger emotions towards certain beliefs. Like being anti-gay. So it can be that they don't believe some parts of the Bible because of individual bias or greed or whatnot. It's not in line with them. I've seen people who are gay or bi go to churchs and look over the anti-gay stuff and praise God. So..."

atheism,f0ka7gh,t1_f0k709x,1568674298.0,Pretty much the rest of my family has either stopped being religious or have been pardoned by mom cause in her eyes they are a fuck up. My oldest brother has moved out so many I can go with him. He knows and understands everything that's been going on. He is on my side because he too shares the same demeanor that our church is fucked up and my mom isn't being fair. I will talk to my counselors and heed there advice.
atheism,f0j6nca,t1_f0hxyn0,1568651904.0,"The reason why I am still having to contact CPS as a strat is because my mom does put church over family. Just a little history, my mom did neglect me from the ages of 8 to 14 . She only kinda started paying attention to me when i told her hey I'ma kill myself. She's reverting back to her old ways again of just focus on church. I don't want to though that drama again so I love but... I would play the part but it's mentally draining having to pretend something your not as well as having a self-righteous cunt insult you every time you go to a sermon. The whole church doesn't do anything either cause he is the pastor. He studies the bible very well and is in great contact with God. God put him so if you attack him you attack us, that's another story for another post."

atheism,f0h2cv0,t1_f0h0eu9,1568611390.0,"That's was a great watch. Kinda sums up what I've been living and what I think. My mom is necessarily scared of difference or change but rather but scared of the evil that the world has to offer because she's been through a lot of dark moments with how deceiving people can be and how fucked up my own family is. I try to reassure her that I am not some fuck up and that I know there is evil in the world but I am not afraid of it because I have an amazing support system. Also, a talking point I have with my mom: if God is  all good and all powerful then why the fuck are children getting molested in churches and violence near everywhere. 
I will try that route but if my mom wants to stick to her guns then all I can really do is just worry about getting myself ahead and if it gets too out of hand then fuck it, bye."
atheism,f0h0c89,t1_f0gzwhu,1568610117.0,True but it's like the only my pastor will listen too. I've had previous talks with him and he's said literally that the reasons why arguments are flawed is because it's based on logic and not spirituality. So maybe having something to fire back might help.
