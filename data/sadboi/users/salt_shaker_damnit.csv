Whether you are truly upset with how you respond, or if it's actually societal pressure making you feel like you should be different than you are, is ultimately something you'll have to discover for yourself.

*This is the final product of nearly 7 months' labor. Perhaps it's anticlimactic; still the process was enjoyable, maybe even therapeutic. Call it my anger in a nutshell, call it poorly-assembled symbolism, call it liberal bullshit. Go ahead and use whatever narrow labeling you feel compelled to. So much truth is lost to reactionary fervor.*

*Am I angry? Rightfully so. Am I flawed in my symbolism? Yes I think so, since one image with 8 words can't convey all the nuance there is to be had. Am I another insufferable liberal? Fuck no, insomuch as a liberal does not a leftist make, despite all conflation of the two terms.*

Later when people found out that I was ""considering hormones,"" (already on testosterone by that point, but hiding it for safety) it seemed like every toxic force from my childhood descended on me, because now their idea of me and how I could be used in their lives was threatened.

Nmom had so much cognitive dissonance that she ""never realized I had issues"" despite homeschooling me all the way from age 5 to 18, and Nsister/flying monkey couldn't ""in good conscience"" use male pronouns. With that -- and literally everything else as it related to the religious/cishet/capitalist/white default that they accepted as the one true reality -- I started going NC 8 months ago. I'm still sorting through all of the people from my past (I don't think I'll stop seeing a therapist anytime soon) and seeing just how harmful they were and are, even removed from me.
