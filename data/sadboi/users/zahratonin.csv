mentalhealth,esgou83,t3_c7nwsi,1561960267.0,You can always seek out your schools mental health resources to get a better idea of what the process is. It can vary based on your department at some schools but typically a campus will accommodate around that kind of thing.

mentalhealth,eqcd480,t3_bxs3g8,1559966740.0,"Anger is fear, and when parents can‚Äôt see that, things get hurtful. When I was in high school, I had skipped 2 weeks of a class because it gave me anxiety. I would try to sneak into school, id give the secretary a forged note that I was sick to get the absence excused so my mom wouldn‚Äôt find out. Well, one day I saw the secretary before I could do so. I still skipped the class, so they called home. When my mom grilled me on why I hadn‚Äôt been going, I took it as an opportunity to tell her what was going on. I was depressed, I had been cutting. She didn‚Äôt talk to me for a week. Then she made me sit down in front of my dad and brother and show them my scars. They all were really mad. I was ungrateful. I was a freak. Etc. My grades were always bad. I believed I wasn‚Äôt very smart until I was 22! But, I‚Äôve learned I‚Äôm actually really intelligent. They just aren‚Äôt. And that can feel so isolating and so sad. But you aren‚Äôt alone. Unfortunately a lot of parents just react, usually out of fear, because they don‚Äôt understand their own emotions. They project their expectations of themselves onto others, they fail to see their kids as individuals, rather, they see  them as extensions of themselves.
It‚Äôs brave if you to even recognize you are depressed, and that you probably wouldn‚Äôt be successful in school at the moment. It shows you are more in tune with what you need. And if that‚Äôs a break, that‚Äôs completely warranted. You‚Äôre a person! You deserve the world. You do not deserve that reaction. I love my parents despite years of abuse. It‚Äôs complicated, but I get it. It helps me to know they have simply chosen ignorance. It helps me expect less, but it always hurts. You are so courageous. Do what is best for you unapologetically. You are smart. Keep listening to what you need! That will get you farther than any degree (or whatever you‚Äôre working toward). That will bring you peace."
mentalhealth,epu0tcu,t3_bvyjo0,1559501495.0,"Absolutely. And it's tough to deal with, I want to have a life with my boyfriend and get married and the whole thing but I feel like I want him to just accept that I'll do that eventually. But of course that's totally fucked up of me and then I dread the idea of being alive until I'm old just because I felt too much empathy for the people I love to do what I (think) I want. Ughhhskjsfhsj"
