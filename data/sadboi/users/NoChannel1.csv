Liberalism takes little to no intelligence to argue for because of how much it's forced into our society. Notice how every other country that stood up to the West is demonized by the same rhetoric. (Authoritarian, starving, mass murder,) yet, you look at old videos of people living in the Soviet Union stemming from the 50s all the way toward the 90s and it's normal life like we have here except people have a moral compass. I wish I could find the video, but I stumbled across a video from the 80s depicting Soviet and American college students in an auditorium debating cultural values. To no surprise, the Americans had none. Notice how the West or the U.S. in particular is the only country with a mental health crisis. The mass shootings, mental health issues, racism, and poverty are all a result of the sociopathic desire to be liberated by stepping on every ethic and moral in sight.
