Accounting,fr1xioe,t3_gm5858,1589827605.0,"If you want to get into software focus in your certifications, not the formal university path. Want to be a data engineer? Complete Microsoft's azure data engineer certification. 

It's a way to prove you capabilities in those specific skills. People get a data analytics degree and that accomplishment differs based on the university, the courses, the teachers. It doesnt really prove you know the material well but if you get certified through a nationally recognized body in your field then employers will know you actually know those skills and can apply them in practical settings. 

Do some research into these certifications. If your looking at software based certs, Microsoft is a good launching point. Pretty sure amazon has some AWS ones too.

I'm assuming other fields of work are similar. I just used this topic as an example as my wife changed her career this way at 35. You can use certifications in place of a very costly MBA, that like you said has lost its value."

My sister went through IVF, it didnt work, they tried for 6 years then gave up. Right after giving up she got pregnant, then while recovering from her first baby got pregnant again. Her husband got a vasectomy after that lol. 

They seem really happy because both mom and dad really love being parents. They also have the means to hire a tutor who has helped with the kids development. Even during the quarantine they're all getting by pretty well, although a little stir crazy like the rest of us.

Accounting,fqxcnjf,t1_fqx90z8,1589730007.0,"This! I recently spoke with a mentor figure and he said he wouldnt recommend an MBA now but back when he was starting his career it helped him branch into his feild, which is slightly different from pure accounting work. This was in the mid 80s though, when it was cheaper and less common. He also said now that certifications are becoming more recognized, this knowledge can be proven through certification rather than just education. 

I personally think this shift, viewing certifications positively, is largely due to the tech industry and how they operate. Most tech skills (like software proficiency) are certified, thus HR is use to accepting these certifications as proof of ability. Before this people really only saw the degree as proof of ability but I really think that's changing now."

She realized she needed more certifications to advance any further and has had to put alot of effort into software certifications, like azure. 

This too can be true for accountants, with out certifications, you're less marketable. But the bug difference here is that every company needs accountants, not every company need data scientists. So theres higher competition in her field which leads her to needing more certifications to stand above the rest. It's also difficult for her because some of her competitors have PhDs. Even I've an accountant had a PhD, it doesnt really sqew the playing field because after your CPA. That's just extra that some company's might not care about, but that's not the case in data science. 

I've you looking for a stimulating, challenging field I'd recommend you bite the bullet and pursue data science. If your looking for something straightforward and easier, go with accounting."

Every state has different requirements for certification so look at you state board of accountancy. Youd be better off getting a masters in accounting to accomplish this as you already have the bachelors. It's not as rare as you may think for non accounting undergrads to go after an accounting masters. You'll just need to take the prereqs. 


The CMA, only requires a bachelors degree. You can find more about that through the governing body, IMA.

Your chapter may be really helpful building some local connection who can mentor you while your getting back to work. 

The CMA requirements for education would be fulfilled with you bachelors, so youd need to take both parts of the exams and gain work experience. None of that has to happen in any particular order, so for now it might be best to focus on your reviews. After signing up for IMA, you'll have access to their discount code used to get 25% off wiley products.

IMA also has some webinar resources but I haven't looked into those too much, so I'm not sure how helpful it would be.

Take charge on cooking some new healthy meals, start doing yoga or other training where he can see you, question whether a snack is a health option. If he thinks oh, let's go out for beers maybe just grab one or two singles at the convenient store, rather than 12 or 6, and have a night in. Try cooking more fish and veggies. Keep fruit or popcorn or other low calorie snacks around. Gently give honest feedback and compliments. Also don't over do it, your trying to make this new changes his new normal so take them slowly and ease up if you feel him burning out in something. Also encourage drinking water, like all the time. The better hydrated someone is, the less likely they are to want to snack. 

Also what really helped me (but he may have to do this on his own or it wont stick) throw away all the processed sugars. Sugar can really be addictive and without moderating intake it can really pack on the pounds. 

If you find your self frustrated have an honest and blunt conversation with him. These types of conversations, when presented rarely should have a big impact.

Anxiety,fps83pf,t3_gf6gv9,1588869054.0,"This can be VERY serious. I'd highly recommend doing a sleep study! This could be sleep apnea. Which can be damaging to your health if not addressed. My dad got it pretty bad once he put on extra weight and I use to have it as a child. It's very important to get a full cycle of sleep regularly and not stop breathing randomly, which is what could cause the alarmed waking state."
DeadBedrooms,fps7l0i,t3_gf6afq,1588868804.0,"He may be feeling insecure about himself. When I was most most insecure about me body (I had put on too much weight) I withdrew. But he took a low pressure opening. One in which his performance wouldnt be judged. If hes like me he also is too insecure to talk about insecurities. 

This is just a wild idea based on my own past. If I'm right, you could try and be supportive of a positive change, like exercise or eating better. Once my wife got on board for building our home gym, things changed for us. Her asking to feel my muscles and me losing weight all made me feel better and we've started to leave our DB behind.

I didnt really know why I had withdrawn until it started getting better."

Accounting,fpr8pp5,t3_gey4os,1588846454.0,"My wifes a data scientist, with a masters in engineering that she specialized with advanced AI courses. I'm an accountant getting ready for the CPAs. She'll have a much more prosperous career than me but theres no way I can do what she does. 

Look at a multivariate text book and see if you like that type of math. If not, stick with accounting. If you thrive with that type of work and programming, really do your research because like others have said it's a tough industry. The only reason my wife is doing well is because shes worked in nuclear energy and areospace as an engineer and company's seem to like diverse engineering background in addition to her software skills and analytics degree. She also spends a lot of her free time learning new software skills, constantly. She really is a lifetime student (like most engineers) but I couldnt do that type of work as much or as good as she can. 

You really need to evaluate your own skills and capabilities."
Accounting,fpr838g,t1_fpqvi5a,1588845817.0,"Agreed to some extent. I drink coffee about a quarter of my days but it's more for enjoyment than energy. I also scoot into my home gym with little energy but as soon as I start my workout, I feel empowered. I feel like if your eating okay, working out, and getting sleep you dont NEED drugs. 

And I took adderall in high school and damn that was wierd. I got super focus and would pump out work but I feel like I barely retained any of it. I would get way off track if something distracted me because I would just hyper focus on that distraction. 

I don't get why so many people here praise uppers"

This wonderful woman is there putting herself in that kind of risk just so I can know if my wife needs to continue to work from home. I know I'm not the only one who coughed during the test and who knows if she has access to clean masks every time she comes in. 

Y'all in the healthcare field are really doing so much, I wish there was a way we all could help you guys more. 

Please know so many of us are so thankful for all you and your colleagues are doing and risking for then general public."

TrueOffMyChest,fppxki3,t3_gekaxl,1588811106.0,"Buy a rowing machine. If you're willing to pay for a gym, you can afford one. We just bought ours for 600 but they have cheaper models, my wife just wanted the one with water so it was more. Magnetic ones can cost as low as 200. 

It's an exercise that is full body cardio. I've been obese for the last 10 years and did 5 minutes and got winded. It's amazing and working out at home is so much less stressful. I suffer from anxiety and building my home gym has been a game changer. Rowers also can be stored in a standing position so you can reclaim that space when not in use. 

Please consider it. Your heart should be taken care of, your life is worth the effort.

Oh and it's also low impact so it's easy on the joints even when you're at a heavy weight."

She also prefers to drink out of glasses, instead of a cat bowl. We noticed she kept drink from our cups even though her bowl had water. I switched her bowl for a glass of her own and now she drinks only from her glass. 

She just wants to be a civilized kitty. Maybe your cat wants the same, maybe get her a plate of her own."
