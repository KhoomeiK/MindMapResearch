I was asleep and woke up with stabbing pain I started to feel nauseous and shaky, i also had bad vowel movements. I didn‚Äôt want to make a big deal so I kept walking around the isles until I couldn‚Äôt anymore. Before the flight, I had pain the before where I felt the pop the pain was bad but went away. On the flight, the pain immediately went from 0-10. And I was crying silently not to disturb people on the plane. I went to the flight attendant to ask for Tylenol (which did not work) I was moved to an area (near first class) where the was a lounge with no one but one woman in there. I told the attendants that it was a cyst and luckily one of them had experience cysts burst so they knew my pain. They considered turning the plane and having an emergency landing but I insisted that I‚Äôll be okay as it‚Äôs happened before but about 10 years prior. They called a doctor on the plane but the doctor on the flight didn‚Äôt want to be bothered and so they called an emergency doctor on land who told them to give me Tylenol and ibuprofen together. It didn‚Äôt take the pain away completely but the combination of the polls, a hot water bottle and hot tea it helped me the last few hours of my flight. I had one of the flight attendants talk to me until I passed out. After landing into my layover destination, I was taken to a hospital which they found that the cyst erupted was in the opposite side of where the pain was."

melbourne,ffks4cu,t3_eu3zkq,1580027908.0,"Recently moved back at the end of November. I learned that in good neighborhoods the amount of rent advertised isn‚Äôt the final price...why? Because everyone offers more! So then you get agents asking if you can pay more. 

You get 15 min increments to view an apartment and it‚Äôs nearly always packed with people and most the time the showing is during work hours. 

I had to show pay stubs of my SO and I and rental history. On top of that they ask for 3 references per person. 

I remember a few agents asking to make more than double and some said 3xs the monthly amount. 

For area, look at places that have easily accessible transport. The area depends on the lifestyle you want and what you can afford. 

When a place says $500 per week note that most likely they‚Äôll charge per month which ends up being $2142. That‚Äôs because they divide the week into day and times in for the days in the month. I hope that makes sense. That amount is just a number for the example."

millionairemakers,fbirf2d,t3_edhj2m,1576910938.0,"I‚Äôm just going to put it out there. 2019 has been extremely difficult for me. I left a job of almost four years after they tried to refuse to allow me to leave to take care of my sister whose bipolar and MS restricts her daily life activities. As time approached, I found another job in which after interviews and conversation I decided to move interstate for since they said they understand that I already booked a trip to care for my sister. 

When I returned to work, I had a medical emergency and my boss didn‚Äôt take it lightly so I checked myself out of the hospital to return to work the next day. In the 2 weeks leading up to hospitalization and surgery, I had an increase of pain which I ignored because I was afraid that I would disappoint my new boss. I had missed a whole week of work, texted him throughout my hospital stay and on Friday after my surgery. I told them that I would be returning back on Monday.  He never responded. However, Sunday night, I got a not so nice email saying to not come into work because I was terminated. 

I had used all my savings to move for this job, and just got an apartment 2 weeks after I signed a one year lease. I drained my savings to afford living because I didn‚Äôt have sick leave accumulated.  

I cried and then I felt angry. I sold some items to make my rent for December (which my family also helped with). I‚Äôve been applying for work but I‚Äôm worried about telling them I will need a few days off in January for another surgery and follow ups. 

I‚Äôm so ashamed of putting myself through that risk that didn‚Äôt work out and now I‚Äôm just hoping I can survive and maybe find casual work soon for January‚Äôs rent payment. 

Not sure if this will be seen but if you select me, whatever is accumulated, I‚Äôll just take enough for my bills while I recover and give the rest away to charities."
