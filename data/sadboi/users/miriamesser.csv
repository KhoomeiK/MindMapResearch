BeautyGuruChatter,fhc1t2u,t3_f1m288,1581454490.0,I have the BH Cosmetics Zodiac Palette too and as she was raving about it I pulled it out and looked at it like a proud momma. I almost forgot about this palette but I really have to use it more often.
BeautyGuruChatter,fhc05g1,t3_f2do17,1581453536.0,I hope this doesn't end in people spamming her on twitter showing off their looks and begging to stay (or get added) to the PR List - I am so sick of that. She could tweet about the most random thing and somehow someone would find a way to beg her to get noticed.

Anxiety,feehr25,t3_eonw76,1579033999.0,"I feel like this all the time, too.
I like listening to people talking about something they are passionate about, but when I do it myself I feel stupid. Like the other person really doesn't care and just doesn't want to be rude and admit it.
I rarely talk about things I like anymore and when I do I feel stupid."

If it hasn't changed after a few weeks, you can go back to your doctor and discuss the symptoms. :)"

BeautyGuruChatter,f9nlkwh,t3_e5yg7a,1575486619.0,"I felt this video so so much.
It is really like she somehow crawled into my head and is describing what a shitshow is going on inside of it.

I am feeling a little bit better knowing that I am not alone with these feelings and a lot of you guys have similar problems."

BeautyGuruChatter,f4na6yz,t1_f4mxno8,1571687354.0,"I am so glad someone hates it, too! Everyone hypes it up so much. It does not blend, it looks patchy and emphasizes every bit of texture under my eyes. I much prefer the Fit Me Concealer."
BeautyGuruChatter,f20vjmi,t3_dbbcha,1569864610.0,"Loved the video and agreed on the Nikita palette, it is so creepy. Imagine opening up your drawer and seeing that face.."
BeautyGuruChatter,f0waamz,t3_d6vf9l,1569002691.0,Why your foundation/concealer routine sucks from Jackie Aina. Or alternatively any of her unpopular opinion videos.
BeautyGuruChatter,f0pmgcg,t3_d63a9y,1568837695.0,"I think the first Beauty Guru I watched was Jaclyn Hill. Could have been NikkieTutorials, not sure. 
I don't watch Jaclyn anymore, I don't enjoy her personality and her videos, I think we all know... 

 I still like Nikkie, but I realized that she has a really different taste in make up than I do. I am not about that cake face, full coverage life anymore. I am still subscribed to her but rarely watch her videos."
BeautyGuruChatter,extui05,t3_cubvzb,1566574969.0,"Does anyone know someone who doesn't use false lashes or at least not with every look? I enjoy colorful eyeshadow etc. but I just don't like wearing lashes. I would love to recreate some looks that look good without having to put on huge lashes.
So far I know of Kathleen Lights and Alissa Ashley who do this. Would love to hear your recommendations! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
BeautyGuruChatter,esmjyoz,t1_esiw1hl,1562107330.0,I did not even think about this! Yes probably that is what it means. But I think a lot of people (me included) fall for the misleading title and think it is going to be about drama. Probably intentional from Shane..
BeautyGuruChatter,esmjhak,t1_eskgakx,1562107008.0,"It was just a show-off for Jeffree. Just to make sure everyone and their mom knows how rich he is. Why would I want to know what his house looks like? I really don't care...
I have a feeling this next series is just gonna be Shane gasping at warehouses and production workers."
MakeupRehab,eshqmh3,t3_c7tft3,1561999104.0,"That is great! I try to do that, too.
Whenever I feel like I have to put on make up or cover my acne, I try to stop using it for at least a week. I need that to accept my bare face again and that I am beautiful without make up."
BeautyGuruChatter,esbpn6x,t1_esaxpoh,1561805465.0,Jaime French! She has great videos on how to do looks on hooded eyes!
BeautyGuruChatter,es3ed0a,t3_c5ojek,1561560592.0,"Colourpop Blush Stix! Beauty News swatched them and Kathleen talked about them.
I just love cream blushes and bronzers and the colors are calling my name.
But tbh I have a lot of powder blush that is also really pretty and that I could use instead.
I use the tiniest amount of blush on a daily basis so the ones I already own would probably last me years... I have to resist."

We always think too much, it is much likely she is busy or not thinking about it and not ignoring you. I know this is easier said than done but please do not give up and do not lose hope! 
You can send me a private message if you need someone to talk to. I am here."
