Personally, I‚Äôd take it as a sign.
Please don‚Äôt let your precious child around this basket case whatsoever. Ever.
File a report. Start a paper trail. Keep record of everything.
Not to be discouraging, but if DH turns, you at least have a paper trail should your relationship sour. It‚Äôs in your‚Äôs and DD‚Äôs best interest.

GriefSupport,fqeggvz,t3_gi94h8,1589307153.0,"My sister died in my arms. She was paralyzed and fell into the pool. I believe it was suicide. Her catheter was wrapped around the wheel chair arm so it made it extremely difficult to pull her to the side of the pool (she was face down). Once I got her to the side of the pool, I was able to flip her over so she could breathe. As I was trying to stimulate her, everything went silent and oddly peaceful. I can‚Äôt explain it but it felt as if angel wings wrapped around us and at that point, I knew she was gone.
Death is absolutely a part of life. Being a witness to it is an entirely different story. It shouldn‚Äôt be a part of life for anyone who isn‚Äôt trained to handle it. Unfortunately, it is.
I‚Äôve been diagnosed with PTSD because of my experience. I‚Äôm not a professional, but I would be willing to bet you do as well.
I offer my deepest condolences in your loss and having had to experience that. I encourage you to seek counseling and begin the process of working through it if you haven‚Äôt already.

A parent has no right to snoop through their child‚Äôs room - especially not reading a journal. The only permissible time would be a drug problem. However, it‚Äôs clear to me drugs aren‚Äôt involved.
