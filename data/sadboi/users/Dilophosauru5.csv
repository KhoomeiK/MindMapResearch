AskReddit,fl5dpoy,t3_fmhep2,1584834327.0,"Dulce et decorum est by Wilfred Owen, a WW1 poet. This really stuck with me after covering it in school. 

Bent double, like old beggars under sacks,
Knock-kneed, coughing like hags, we cursed through sludge,
Till on the haunting flares we turned our backs,
And towards our distant rest began to trudge.
Men marched asleep. Many had lost their boots,
But limped on, blood-shod. All went lame; all blind;
Drunk with fatigue; deaf even to the hoots
Of gas-shells dropping softly behind.


Gas! GAS! Quick, boys!‚ÄîAn ecstasy of fumbling
Fitting the clumsy helmets just in time,
But someone still was yelling out and stumbling
And flound‚Äôring like a man in fire or lime.‚Äî
Dim through the misty panes and thick green light,
As under a green sea, I saw him drowning.
In all my dreams before my helpless sight,
He plunges at me, guttering, choking, drowning.


If in some smothering dreams, you too could pace
Behind the wagon that we flung him in,
And watch the white eyes writhing in his face,
His hanging face, like a devil‚Äôs sick of sin;
If you could hear, at every jolt, the blood
Come gargling from the froth-corrupted lungs,
Obscene as cancer, bitter as the cud
Of vile, incurable sores on innocent tongues,‚Äî

My friend, you would not tell with such high zest
To children ardent for some desperate glory,
The old Lie: Dulce et decorum est
Pro patria mori."

Teachers,fjuxrzi,t1_fjupw9d,1583621239.0,"Yes. I‚Äôve only been at one school. I haven‚Äôt done a teaching interview in ages and the idea of a new school and a lesson observation terrifies me. We didn‚Äôt have formal observations for performance management and the idea of going to a school with those scares me. I think my confidence has been knocked even though I know I‚Äôm a good teacher. I do miss the interactions with the kids though and being in a school environment. I don‚Äôt miss some of the behaviour though! 

Coaching apprentices sounds good. Did your friend have to get extra qualifications for that? I‚Äôve been looking at universities that are local to me and while I know that I can do some of the jobs that are advertised there, from enquiring about education support roles they seem to think that primary education isn‚Äôt relevant enough, which is frustrating."
