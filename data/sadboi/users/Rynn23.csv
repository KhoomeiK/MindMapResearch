I didn’t respond to my first name, as I was usually called by the second half or by my middle (Eastern European, translates to a female warrior) before starting school. 

This was helpful, as my name, which was a variant on the Scottish (English) translation (my step-father’s Scottish, but he has raised me since I was born with my mom), was very similar to the more common spellings.

While in most cases this is true, there are conditions that are fairly common that make the gains from diet and exercise minimal.

The cause of PCOS is linked to an excess of testosterone in the female body which promotes the growth of cysts in the reproductive system that a) can be very painful b) can become cancerous c) pop out of nowhere d) really mess with your hormones e) render you infertile. Many women with PCOS get IUDs to manage their cycle to try to get the hormones under control as much as possible. Because of the excess testosterone a) lots of hair b) more masculine physique including weight distribution around the belly c) very difficult to lose weight

While this may not be the case for the woman on the original post, the images blasted by the media and society are certainly not helpful.

In my personal experience, I gained more than 40 pounds due to this, and I only started to lose weight when I stopped eating due to vertigo and nausea due to an undiagnosed eye condition. 

I can totally see a woman with PCOS wanting liposuction due to this. Frustration and desperation is a motivation."

Forcing people to fall in love with each other or to be friends is wrong, as is protecting the two-person relationship. However, if the two “arms” (in the case of my parents, my dad and my aunt) are on friendly terms, so much the better. The relationship between my three parents is stable because they clearly communicate with each other, share information freely, and make sure that each person is getting the love and attention they need, whether it be romantic, platonic, or somewhere in between. Etc, etc. 

My aunt and my dad are not in love with each other, at least not in the romantic/sexual sense of that phrase. Their relationship is more like siblings or close friends.

I used the term “we” which is wrong. I’m still trying to get the hang of this and figuring out the description. I would like to have a V or or a triad, or cluster, but I have no idea what is going to happen.  

I think my hangup is I’m worried that we will form a V or cluster ( I think I have the terms right) but I’ll get excluded form everybody else because I’m gray-ace.

They might be willing to sponsor a GSA. There is an organization specifically for trans people, due to the unique concerns, along with broader LGBT organizations in the Baton Rouge area. 

What I mean is, there could still be ways you develop a community, if only online (social media, discord, slack, gaming, etc) but I know they have in person meetings as well. 

The other person who is transmed would be worth reaching out to for the same reasons, and could also be helpful in getting your parents to let you go places to hang out with LGBT people, even if that’s not the primary reason: “Mom, dad, there is a hang out tonight, so-and-so is going, it’s from (Tim’s&location). I’ve been having difficulty making friends due to the move , so so-and-so is helping.” 

I’m not advocating lying to your parents, but these are some methods I used when I was a teenager sans car. The essential part is being honest as possible (no secondary locations without notice, no drugs, smoking or alcohol, etc).  The goal is for you to build a community and support system in an unfamiliar place, and to get your parents onboard so they see you being trans as being more than “just a phase”, and that you could still have a good quality of life.  

The ideal result would be for them to be active allies, but don’t be surprised if it doesn’t happen overnight, or if, in the case of my dad in regard to my wife and I’s relationship. they are passive in their support.

If your dad is mentioning the modern attitudes positively that’s a good sign, “just a phase is middling”, but it’s a start. Being open to the idea, even as a “phase”, is so much better than “you will be dead to me if I ever find out you are like that” (my wife had a scare when her grandparents almost found out she’s trans, and that was their attitude).

Either in the original position or in one of the agencies they supervisor. They also said they would give me good recommendations once I graduated with my masters, and open to hiring me on.

Then again, they were impressed with my work performance, expertise, and professionalism (though judging from what I could tell, it wasn’t exactly a high bar given the behavior of some part student workers and part/full time employees which were doing the same things I did in the department). Additionally, I didn’t reveal my spouse’s gender until after I had been working there for a while, which was by accident. I always call my spouse L (Elle) and am vague unless it’s safe.

LSU is purportedly a safe campus, but I wouldn’t dream on letting anyone know unless it was necessary, or it was another member of the community. My spouse and I pass for a straight couple, but I don’t know what happens once my spouse starts to transition. 

That all of this research, caution, and being in a state of hyperawareness is necessary for us to live our lives which straight people typically don’t have to deal with is infuriating.  

It also puts a distance between you and other people who are not in the know, which is a large part of why we only consider three people close enough friends to have over on Monday.

We are having a Friendsgiving on Monday. Two of the people know (both in the community, one of whom has a similar relationship to L and I), and one who doesn’t. I talked about it with L, and we decided that we would simply use Elle’s name and preferred pronouns when the one in the dark comes over.

People in middle class and up neighborhoods being pissed that public housing or even income housing is being proposed in their neighborhood. They usually cite lower property values, increased class sizes, busing,  and about increase in crime. However this is typically dog whistling (racism, classism, xenophobia, homophobia, etc.)

An example of this would be starter homes for less than $250 - $300k being proposed in a neighborhood of McMansions,

They will also argue about changes in zoning laws for this reason.

Expect angry, older (usually white, straight) people protesting, signing petitions, etc."

My partner will be a history/French teacher
I am a content specialist in audiovisual and let tonic materials. 

This entails a lot of database building and managing, digitizing and managing collections, working on recordings, data management. I’d love to work at an academic library, but could be hired anywhere that needs specialists on records, especially with all the physical files everywhere and the unwieldy nature of many systems, if they even exist. When I was a student worker at the state government the hard copies were disorganized (previous people not caring about their job) and very little had been digitized."

Edit: look at the downvotes. I was not implying he was faking parts of his identity in order to get more votes, I do think that there seems to be more focus in his campaign on what socio-economic designations he is a part of (LGBT, Millennial, veteran, etc.) then on his track record (spotty) or proposals (center)

It’s like he’s trying to recreate the “chosen one” status Clinton, without near the same success. In this case it’s hard to improve on the original (Obama). I also find it irritating that because I’m ____ (LGBT, Zennial, woman, etc) I’m predisposed to vote for him, not caring about his track record, policies, or who he is beholden to."
