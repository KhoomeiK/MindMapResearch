The relationship ended for different reasons, but if this were to happen to me again, I'd fly that red flag right out of the relationship, no question. 
Prenups are smart, I feel like it shows a certain amount of respect for your partner, if done for the right reasons. I intend on implementing one when I get married. But, if someone changed their mind after me gaining wealth, that'd tell me a lot about the person they are and how much they care about money versus their respect for me."

You get healthier. But your friends should ultimately understand that you need care and have to handle things certain ways. 
It's not their responsibility to handle or fix your symptoms or diagnosis, that's important to understand, but they need to be willing to help. 
Best advice I can give is to find some exercises to help your triggers and create a system when you feel triggered to remind yourself of the present. 
I liked reminding myself the names of people I'm around, the year/month, what's around me and what's not happening.

It's heartbreaking that she didn't stay with you, but it also doesn't make her a bitch, it just makes her the wrong person for you.
I understand how cancer treatment can change a person and maybe you haven't realized how toxic you've became during the process. Don't get me wrong, at your age it's totally normal even without health issues, but it was both your faults. There wasn't a strong bond or communication between the two of you before the cancer and that was the breaking point.

You may have been in the right (entertaining even, as I enjoy savagery), but it was a dick move. Sometimes it is okay to be the asshole, and if I were your boyfriend is appreciate you sticking up for him, but it seems like your comment was more about lashing out at your dad than sticking up for boyfriend. (Still justified, but you and your dad were dicks to each other.) That being said, his fiancee probably already knows what she's getting into with his track record, so she should've expected a comment or two about that. You dad was a bigger (and unjustified) asshole though. Overall, what you said makes you a bit of an asshole but it was probably the appropriate response. That's not something to accept from a parent, especially when you've been together far longer than your brother's and their respective partners."

Probably best not to even gift the necklace, just because the early stages can be really hard and he's probably already having to deal with people using his dead name and using incorrect pronouns. I'd say resell it, find something else, or if you can't afford it, maybe an outing or the gift of your time instead."

I just hope he doesn't have any kids. It's sick and the longer you're in this situation, the worse your mentality towards the world and sexual attraction will get. 
GET OUT."

AmItheAsshole,f7c34ub,t3_dvbf1h,1573583366.0,"NTA, my boyfriend's ex wife was (probably still is) the same way, except she also went out every night spending his money and made more messes for him to clean up. As soon as he started requiring her to do anything, she left him, after 8 years of being together. Make sure your partner isn't just using you as a house and money security. Anyone worth your partnership will be more than happy maintaining their part of the relationship whether it be half the chores and half the money, no money and all chores or all money no chores. Someone who doesn't make money and doesn't do anything around the house is just a leech, nip that shit in the bud. Good luck!"
