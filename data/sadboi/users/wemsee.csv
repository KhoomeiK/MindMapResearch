i mean the maeve skin looks great, but there’s just other champs who deserve skins more than her"

Paladins,fedvpnj,t3_eont6j,1579020894.0,They did. You now get coins and crystals from levelling up the battle pass.

Paladins,fe2mi4l,t1_fdzgk0y,1578840565.0,"My healer Skye loadout consists of:

Healing Vapors 5
Quick Smoker 5
Confound 2 
Poisoner 2 
Shadow Affinity 1

This allows you to be throwing as many smoke screens out as possible lol. The combo of confound and poisoner really helps. You could even run confound a little higher, and switch out Shadow Affinity out for another card of your choice, it just depends on your playstyle. Healing Vapors and Quick Smoker 5 are the ones who really make the biggest difference. Hope this helps:)"

Paladins,fe2lpth,t1_fe03ejy,1578840099.0,Terminus did really great. I think the three healer comp may have helped him more than expected lol.
Paladins,fa00q8x,t1_f9yn34h,1575747443.0,Yeah lol. I don’t think I’ll be buying levels with my gold.
