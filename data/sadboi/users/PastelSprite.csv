&nbsp;

This exactly. In my city, it's common to have cars broken into. I never leave my purse in the car though regardless of how common that is or not; most crimes are crimes of opportunity. 
&nbsp;

Yes, a child could get kidnapped right next to you, but the likelihood is just less since it's not as ""good"" an opportunity than if they're left alone.

&nbsp;

As a former teacher's aide, this thread is disturbing. Yeah your kid's safer from weather conditions in the car on a 50F degree day, but it's illegal for more reasons than just the weather. I've even seen cases of dogs snatched out of cars. **Always** at least prepare for worst if someone else's life is at risk, especially someone in your care.

&nbsp;

Edit just to add, there are many things that can happen while you're not present. Kids seemingly try constantly to murder themselves(coming from someone who's had classes full of children). We are taught to constantly position ourselves so that all children will somehow be in our line of view- we have to do this with classes of 10+ children- most able bodied adults can do it with 1,2, or 3, just read about it, practice at home. I had failed at this in first starting my job and on day 1 I had some morons bring in a bucket of chemicals and 2 kids ran towards it, people wouldn't watch when they shut the door, kids would stuff things in their mouths,etc. You learn quick. You can't trust toddlers and babies, and kids older than that can still require supervision. 

&nbsp;

Babies especially should never be left unsupervised; when I trained with babies, we had to consistently check on each one and position ourselves to be able to see them at all times. As a parent, a monitor can be helpful. Babies are at risk of flipping on their bellies or moving their heads and suffocating. Some of my babies would even choke on their spit in their sleep. 

&nbsp;

A few years back, a kid got stuck between some seats or something in a car and suffocated. He was a bit older too. Prepare for the worst, don't gamble with a life. It's really not worth it. And not everything Europeans do makes it a good reason to do or not do just because they are overall cooler than us. That doesn't make sense."

I feel like talking about people's bodies in general and teasing them isn't the right approach regardless though. Chances are, if someone has looked at someone else and thought of teasing them, that person has already been doing it to themselves.

&nbsp;

When I was overweight as a kid, the teasing actually made me reclusive and then lonely and bored which made me turn to food more. I was extremely neglected and my food intake wasn't structured or monitored at all which is why I was a fat kid to begin with(try giving a kid the choice between broccoli and a cupcake lol).
It also inevitably ended up becoming bulimia and anorexia. My time being bulimic, I literally wasted so much food that it was shameful. 

&nbsp;

And my bf is depressed and has gained a lot in recent years. He's now having health problems. I'd rather make us dinner and just assure him that I love him and be encouraging. When I feel bad about myself, that becomes ""me"" and then I do gain weight, and I find the same happens to him; the worse he feels, the more he eats junk food I guess because it's comforting and he identifies himself as ""fat"" anyway. It's kind of hard to explain, but the gist of it is that teasing doesn't seem to be the right approach, or often a successful one."

&nbsp;

Interestingly, now that you mention that, this has only happened to me from very overweight or obese people too.  My mom was always overweight and a bit narcissistic. Amidst my ED, I often thought she was upset because I had become thin and she wanted me to be fat again because she thought I was competing or some weird shit like that(she often thought I was competing for my dad's attention ü§¢). It wasn't about her at all. She'd get really nasty and personal with me about the fact that I lost weight- calling me a ""slut"" or ""dirty"" even though I'd never even had a bf and couldn't even leave my room, or telling me I only had an ED because I hated her and didn't want to look like her. Those were definitely not the reasons.

Anyone I know, family or acquaintance who is similarly thin never says anything to me about my body. That's really shitty that happened to you, especially at work. The double standard makes no sense. I'm glad you didn't get fired, but even almost being fired and the other guy not is upsetting."

OliveMUA,f4sfo55,t3_dlo1cp,1571777239.0,"Click or swipe right for the album :) swatches are only included above where they're labeled, otherwise it's my natural skin. I'm somewhere around NC25 with facial redness, and a somewhat more neutral olive. All pics are in natural lighting.

&nbsp;

Included some extra swatches at the end- can add more upon request depending on what I have atm üòÖ(I know I have Fenty matte 145, Fenty dewy 240, GA Power Fabric 4.5, Nars SG Ceylan and Fiji, maybe Nars LW Ceylan and Fiji). I'd also tried Nepal at the store, but it was pretty peachy on me. I don't take unblended swatches besides on white paper because I feel like surrounding skin color can skew how the foundation looks. But, if anyone would like that regardless, feel free to lmk!

&nbsp;

My best match appears to be Manila(medium with olive undertone), though honestly on white paper(which should show the colors more true than watching against skin) it doesn't look very olive. Slightly more cool olive maybe? Idk. But it appears olive when applied on my skin and matches my body best. 

&nbsp;

My next good match is Bolivia(medium-cool golden undertone). It looks just slightly yellow or ashy while compared to the rest of my skin. If Manila wasn't an option, I'd probably choose this next. I'm probably going to just keep the two and use Bolivia where I'd like to brighten a little.

&nbsp;

Anyway, I usually consider myself a cool or more neutral olive(Dior 2wo is one of my more olive foundations and it's slightly too warm for me- I find the same with the ABH, though those are ok summer matches). I also have a ton of facial redness which probably influences the color a little, but overall I feel like this should be an ok match for neutral or cooler olives. It doesn't show as green as some of my other foundations, so I wouldn't say it's a very ""true"" olive, but it's workable for a cooler olive.

&nbsp;

My best matches for reference:

I found out that nurses didn't make as great of money as I was told, but before that, my response would always be, ""but I couldn't handle working with people and taking care of them."" I didn't want the money just for the money, I thought being a nurse required having patience that I don't have and massive amounts of empathy, which would wear me down further, so I've always said I will never do that job. I wanted patients to have a good nurse who was really suited for the job.

I hate to be an ass, but I feel like a lot of people go into it because their friends did, they were told it made good money, or maybe they thought it would look nice or even be nice to help, without realizing they didn't possess the right qualities for the job. Sorry if that is harsh, that's just how I feel towards the bad ones, which seem to be *a lot*, but certainly not all. There are many nurses like yourself who are compassionate and seem to have gone into the field because that's where their talents and heart is.

I hate drugs and wasn't ever there for them, any of the times I went. Most of the people I met hated drugs and wanted help. But my most recent stay, about 70% wanted drugs and knew they'd be back.

If they had said 90% of all people who've ever stayed in a ward, anywhere, I'd definitely disagree too though haha. At all my stays, there were definitely people who were very abusive towards the staff. It always made me sad because most of them were nice. At my last stay, one nurse who hadn't gotten to know me was so haunted by other residents that he was freaked out about literally everything I'd do lol. Most people there were in the middle of some sort of psychotic episode, meanwhile I was just sick of being shat on by everyone I knew and wanted to die. Don't think he read my file.
