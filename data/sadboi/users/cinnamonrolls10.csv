BoJackHorseman,fgcoko6,t3_exub0g,1580674777.0,"While I love foreshadowings and all that, I think that would‚Äôve sent the wrong message to the audience as many of us relate to his depression etc, which I think the creators also realized. It of course wants to end on a more hopeful note"
BoJackHorseman,fgb7j2h,t1_fgb27f3,1580659304.0,"I disagree that he should‚Äôve been the bigger person to call Bojack to salvage the friendship. The friendship could‚Äôve still meant a lot to him and at the same time wanted to maintain his dignity. Bojack was the one to hurt him and not even reach out afterwards, that just sends Herb the message that Bojack didn‚Äôt value him, so why would he want to continue to pursue that friendship? The ball was in BJ‚Äôs hand, Herb was willing to forgive. I think his pride was valid."
BoJackHorseman,fg8fmk2,t3_exi9kl,1580618061.0,"While I was also heartbroken over that, I think it also gives room for him to start over, meet new friends in which he can start fresh without having caused any damage on them.

BoJackHorseman,fg8fdu9,t3_exii7g,1580617859.0,"I mean, yes, his fame and power did allow him to develop a mindset wherein he could always get away with anything he does, regardless how awful. And resources to sustain his drinking habits and eventual addiction, and we know addiction changes people too. 

But the thing is, Bojack is the definition of ‚Äúgood in theory, but poor in execution‚Äù. In early seasons he kept expressing how much he wanted to be good and do good, and yet he never made consistent effort to do and be just that. I don‚Äôt necessarily view him as a bad person (not good either and he definitely can be an asshat) but ultimately he‚Äôs someone who made a series of poor decisions, just like many of us, and regardless of the factors that caused those poor decisions, he ‚Äúbecame a bad person‚Äù because of him. His choices, his thoughts."

Even when she knew he would never reciprocate her feelings. She always tried to understand him and ultimately was the most consistent person in BJ‚Äôs life. I think those are very big acts of love; forgiveness, understanding, and doing things without expecting anything in return."
BoJackHorseman,fg7a7xy,t3_exbhmq,1580587639.0,"Same thoughts. I never expected a very happy ending for Bojack or him getting out of the consequences of the things he‚Äôs done, but I was hoping at least, that they would stick to the message I thought they were trying to impart, which was that change was possible.

I guess I phrased that badly, I meant she didn‚Äôt express any external/apparent problems throughout the years that could explain her behavior easier. (But of course mental illness is chemical imbalance too, so it could happen regardless).

I‚Äôve been trying to get her to see mental health professionals for some time now, and so has the bf (even though he still doesn‚Äôt know the real severity), and her parents don‚Äôt believe in mental illness. She tried to see one but backed out after one session, saying she‚Äôs not even that bad. Just a few hours ago she updated me saying she feels better (but only because they semi made up) but I know it‚Äôs gonna happen again, so I‚Äôm really trying to get her into some therapy. My last option would be talking to her mom, but yeah she doesn‚Äôt believe in those.

offmychest,fdsklgu,t1_fdnc0pv,1578704366.0,"Another thing I want to add is I also meant for them to be able to actually understand the morals and values being passed down to them.

I‚Äôm just saying allow them to question things and make them arrive to that conclusion that it is right. 

They should also think it‚Äôs right for them, and not just ‚Äúobey‚Äù.  They should find the essence and have a sense of identity, so it won‚Äôt be easily taken away from them once other people start to influence them.

Not sure if I‚Äôm phrasing this as well as I could, so apologies I‚Äôm sleepy. I was aiming to make a lot of points in my post and tried to make it short so I understand it could be easily be put into the wrong context"

But I guess even those little ‚Äúapologies‚Äù when you‚Äôre in the wrong to them and actually explaining why, goes a long way. Explaining to them why they‚Äôre not allowed to do this and that. Entertain their questions etc. Instead of just stating things like they are law, without then even understanding the purpose or making them question the reason behind them. I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm actually phrasing this as well as I could, because it‚Äôs 2am but yeah. 

I just saw it with my cousin and her son, she was able to raise an intelligent, kind and empathic son and I‚Äôm amazed."
offmychest,fdsi8vj,t1_fdqbgy8,1578703250.0,"For them to willingly want to improve themselves, they must develop their own sense of direction as well. Raise your children with your beliefs why not, all I meant was they should be given enough room to question everything and decide for themselves that that‚Äôs right for them, and understand why. They shouldn‚Äôt follow what they don‚Äôt understand. So many parents give their children rules, prohibitions, without even allowing them to understand the reasons- that‚Äôs not passing down belief/morals, that‚Äôs just teaching them how to be obedient or sometimes even rebelling and be against your cause. 

Of course, we all would want our children to be able to hold down jobs etc. What is your definition of failure though?"
