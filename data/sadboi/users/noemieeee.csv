But I didn’t want to waste my energy on her so I was just nice to her. As soon as we graduated I never spoke a word to her anymore."

AskGayMen,fk2dbkw,t3_feag98,1583798503.0,"So I’m a girl and into girls but my best friend in my class is gay, and we laugh a lot and we’re kinda touchy(actually just because he never makes body contact with anyone else), so everyone thinks we’re together, which is great for us. We didn’t even intend to make it look like we were a thing, people just assumed it and came to me like ‘ohh are you guys dating?’ And I’m always like ‘no we would never’ but no one believes me. Even my best friends(which don’t know I like girls) ask me repeatedly if we are a thing. Works pretty great for us."
