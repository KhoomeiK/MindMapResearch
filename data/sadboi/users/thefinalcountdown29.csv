I came from a very poor family, and I am the first to get my bachelors or masters. Had anyone told me I’d be remotely successful when I was my students’ ages, I would have been shocked. Some days I still can’t believe I am where I am, as well as the impact I have the privilege to have on their lives.

I should also say it is best to go to a credit union or bank rather than the dealership as well.

He is supportive in many ways, but not when it comes to cooking and cleaning. I regret the time I was in your position and didn’t ask for the sake of keeping the peace.

As well, I am an English teacher. During this period of distance learning, I’ve been extraordinarily lenient in regards to due dates and timelines. I know this period is extraordinarily stressful for teens and children. I wouldn’t doubt that most teachers are going to have that same mindset. Consider that.

We would drive past a very old part of town with Victorian houses that had long since been repurposed for boutiques and salons. Well, driving past one house in particular, my daughter would eerily use language beyond what she was normally capable of to tell me from her car seat, “Oh mommy! My old house! My baby! I lived there so long ago!” (Of course in her baby voice and language.) We had only ever lived in one very different apartment at that point. Each night she would dart from a deep sleep and say something similar. I found myself so nervous when she would do this that I would take a different route, but she’d ask why we couldn’t see her old house and how she missed it. Gives me shivers to this day."
