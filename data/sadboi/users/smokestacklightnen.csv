AskReddit,fizysgz,t3_fapq8c,1582880811.0,"Had my heart, sense of self and worth broken down a boyfriend with NPD, here's my list: 


- Inability to take even the slightest criticism. Holding on to perceived criticism with seething resentment for an unimaginable period of time, sometimes permanently. He could swelter with rage for DAYS over a curt email reply. If challenged, he would never apologise, he'd attack with a viciousness you can't imagine.



- Illusion of empathy that is centred on receiving praise or recognition. It is an imitation of empathy with a purpose, usually to boost his own ego (eg appearing community spirited or giving). His birthday fundraiser was for refugees. I now understand his empathy to be an empathy in theory not practice. He liked to have an image as a progressive left wing humanitarian enlightened being. So when I spoke to him about a time I was raped, he started indulging his intellectual enlightened brain about what my rapist must have gone through to become a rapist, ""did he have a bad childhood?"" When I told him no, violence is a choice and I genuinely know more about the research on violent offending than him by virtue of my profession , he shut me down!! It was so genuinely disconnected from my pain, it was baffling. 



- Inflated sense of entitlement that the world can never ever return to him all he feels is owed. He didn't believe he had to work jobs below his intellect. He's currently living off his sick elderly parents' retirement fund while pursuing endless study. This still wasn't good enough for him, apparently he was a victim because academics pays a pittance. I agree employment for academics is woeful for their contribution to society but he took this to such a personal level of resentment and used it to justify abusing women and the elderly in his life. Additionally, he could have worked more to earn an OK living wage, but his poor work ethic meant he was barely passing his PHD with NO additional responsibilities. 



- Drug or alcohol issues. The world will never reward him enough, his loved ones will never appreciate him enough, he is eternally miserable in his blind sense of entitlement. Drugs and alcohol reduced this pain for him. Plus, when you believe every single thing you do is justified and no-one has a right to complain about the impact of your behaviour, you can lie, steal and manipulate your way to funding the behaviour and not being held accountable for the consequences of it. It didn't matter that he was more psychologically violent when he was smoking weed or that he was funneling money out of his dying mum and girlfriend to pay for his habit, we were coerced to keep silent about it. Yes, chicken or the egg. People do shitty things and become shitty when they are addicted. His shitty behaviour long predicated the drug and alcohol abuse. From all accounts, he was manipulative and horrible from late childhood, early adolescence.


- Never, ever truely thankful for anything you do for them. They may graciously thank when it is useful for them to charm you, but they are never genuinely thankful. Especially as time goes on, abuse is justified by resentment and never ending grudges after all. What they are doing to you can never be as bad as what they think you are doing to them! They just find reasons to resent you so anything you do do right is just the beginning of trying to make it up. In their mind, you owe them 1million when you are only giving 1. Or, worse, they assume you are every bit as manipulative as they are and what you are giving is part of your game.



- Cannot detail a relationship or friendship where they learned something or corrected their behaviour. The other person was always wrong. 


- There is no way to console them when their ego is bruised. Nothing you can say will lead to reframing or refocusing or having perspective. Their self righteous rage is infinite. You are best steering clear before you become their punching bag. You can't have a connecting compassionate conversation when they are hurt, it is impossible. You can't connect on shared vulnerability because they will never allow you to see it. They may play victim but that won't genuinely allow you in.



- There is never repair when your relationship breaks down. They will never admit to wrongdoing, and they will never forgive you. Without either possibility, it's just growing hatred on their end. Growing madness on yours. It felt like he decided when our arguments were over because it was no longer useful for him to be arguing with me but no new ground would be forged. Every argument had no resolution."

BPD,fbxha8j,t3_eer7wi,1577187413.0,"Yeah look this is pretty common in BPD I think. When I get stressed, I def become more paranoid (using term loosely) about my friends really hating my guts secretly. It usually means I'm working myself too hard in my job, therapy, life etc. It's helpful to notice those thoughts crop up. I know when I'm about to blow now. Ive tried a social media detox at these times which has been really helpful (& prevented Public meltdowns which I'm also guilty of). I deactivate and delete the apps for a week or so and focus on relaxing me-time stuff eg learning Japanese at the moment for travel reasons, always love a good memoir, gardening, whatever."
BPD,fbxh197,t3_eeue7g,1577187051.0,"It's a hard one. Often part of recovery is moving on from dysfunctional people who you bonded with over chaos and trauma. I've had to cut ties with an abusive ex partner and, no polite way to put it, batshit crazy friends to move forward in my recovery. But you need to be wise about this. Consider giving yourself a grace period of 3 days before blocking. Time to sleep on it and recover from the initial emotion you felt at their action. If you start cutting out people from pure emotional impulse (as I've also been known to do lol), that's usually not helpful!"
BPD,fbxgr63,t3_eeoglx,1577186630.0,"Yeah, look if it helps you ground and connect to the present moment it's good. I use simple ones about my breath, for example ""rising (inhaling), falling (exhaling)"" or count to 10 breaths and start again. If you're becoming too fixated on the chant or mantra itself that it's losing its mindful quality, probably not so good and I would suggest trying different strategies that can help you become ""unstuck"". The key is flexible, non judgmental awareness of the present moment."
BPD,fbxgghl,t3_eezukm,1577186185.0,"Yeah that's the disclaimer I always received with DEAR MAN. It was difficult because when I did the group work I was in an abusive relationship and DEAR MAN would get me in dangerous territory. my heart raced through those groups!! So all I can say is check out the parts of the manual on evaluating your current relationships, it's painful but there may be some people in your life sabotaging your progress. BPD develops in an ""invalidating"" environment. Therefore it's likely there's been people who have built their relationships with you off of your submissiveness /explosion, do something worse and then apologise for even existing so they could skip out on responsibility for their side of the conflict. This is the single most painful part of recovery but also the most important. Use wise mind to think about the relationships where DEARMAN consistently falls down."

CPTSD,fbxfwat,t3_eequig,1577185332.0,"As said in other comments, you can only get so far. I did a lot of my therapy while in an abusive relationship, and my therapists were telling me, ""you're being undermined"" by this relationship. For example, I could barely tolerate even talking about assertiveness because it didn't work with him, it put me *at risk* to stand up to him. I'd be sitting through those groups with my heart racing because I couldn't imagine a situation where I could communicate with him in this way. My being passive was an adaptive thing I was doing to survive in that environment. So certainly it was capping my progress. Yes, I still made a lot of gains while I was with him, but now without him I'm in a peaceful situation I can go further. Last week I had a respectful disagreement with my manager about something that was very important to me. That was agonising but my brain learned you can disagree and not be abused. It helped me to reflect on my boundaries, which will keep me safe in the future. You see what I mean? But look, on an emotional level it's extremely painful. I was so conscious that he was holding me back.. but i didnt want to leave my partner, I did love him and I wanted the abuse to stop. I had to deal with extremely painful knowledge that he wouldn't change and his behaviour was so dysfunctional and I was moving forward while he was so far behind. He was using substances, becoming an alcoholic, barely looking after his own scripts for anti psychotics for an undiagnosed psychotic illness he was too irresponsible to see a psychiatrist about!! It was a toxic environment for someone in recovery. I could only get so far before he'd sabotage my progress, again and again and again!!!"
CPTSD,fbxf2qi,t3_eerjee,1577184056.0,"Yeah, I had pretty bad social anxiety when I was younger. It still doesn't come naturally or with ease but surprisingly I became a social worker (I saw the irony in the name). I work full time now, talk to people intensely and run groups. 

During uni, I completed a social anxiety group program. I hate CBT because I have massive emotional dysregulation (can't think my way out of a lot of my problems) but the exposure therapy part seemed to really help. You just need to keep pushing yourself. My social anxiety wasn't tolerated as a child and in a way that helped me to just keep exposing myself to social situations.  Other suggestions would be a toastmasters club or drama class. I used drama to help me as a kid and teen with this problem too. It's fun!"
CPTSD,fbxes75,t3_eeus00,1577183601.0,"Yeah it's a hard one for me too. I've just come out of a very long domestic abuse relationship. I spent 6 Christmas days with his family. They would cover up all the abuse and issues (he abusing me and his parents) and it was actually the closest to a ""normal"" Family Event I experienced. Growing up, Christmas was tinderbox for family dysfunction and I bore brunt of emotional abuse from my highly controlling and manipulative Nana and my explosive rage father. I was the punching bag in a war between them and my mum. Christmas used to bring incredible anxiety for me and for a long time I hated it... My abusive ex was usually pleasant and placid on Christmas and his family made a fuss so I started to enjoy it again. This year I'm lost. It's also my second Christmas since my father passed away.

AskReddit,fbd89gc,t1_fbbigym,1576751915.0,"As a social worker who works with children, yes this one bugs me too. Depressive disorder in children <11 yo is a thing . It's in the ICD (International Classifications of Diseases). It just looks different in children, e.g. more irritability. Infant mental health is also a thing. There's been talk recently of mental health screening in preschools now. As someone who has also had chronic mental health issues, you could have picked it up in me when I was in preschool- I was socially and emotionally struggling in my behaviour. Instead I was punished for behaving outside of the norm- selective mutism was ""rudeness"", being far too anxious to settle for naps was treated with being snapped at by childcare workers (a giant looming over me and snapping ""GO TO SLEEP"" is very calming thanks ! I just shut my eyes when I heard their footsteps). In primary school, they just screened for intellectual disability and found nothing wrong there but continued to treat behaviour outside of the norm as a behaviour management issue. E.g. more punishment for things I couldn't help. I wasn't taken to a mental health professional until I was a preteen and they were useless. By then, the struggle had been ongoing for sooo many years and early intervention potential was missed. I love my job now because I see how it can change a trajectory of suffering but not enough people understand child and infant mental health is a thing!"

BPD,fas9odg,t3_eafc35,1576324999.0,"That sucks. All children deserve to be cherished.

My mum is not disinterested but disconnected. I'm not sure why but she doesn't seem to naturally empathise with me. I was conscious from an early age I needed to dial my emotion up to 100 to get a response. I'd get a response but only with the caveat I hate so damn much ""you're so sensitive."" I've only recently stopped questioning MYSELF and noticed how out of sync SHE is. 

I told her I came home and cried after a colleague at work made an insensitive comment about domestic abuse. My mum genuinely asked why I had cried. Context: I came out of a domestic abuse relationship less than 4 months ago. Unlike other people in my life, I told her the full story of what my ex was doing to me and she saw first hand the distress and pain. She helped me find accommodation. I stayed with her after the break up. Despite this, when I asked her ""why do YOU think that would make ME cry?"" She genuinely didn't know. I spelled it out and she said, ""ohhhhh I didn't make that connection. (In sympathetic voice) you are such a sensitive girl. "" SMH. 

These kinds of parental relationships are common for BPD sufferers as I understand it. ""Constant invalidation"" = story of my life. I've worked hard on our relationship. The willingness seems to be there on her part but I don't know about capacity. I used to just lash out at her in white hot rage and then feel really awful for how I'd treated her. I'm proud that I now manage conflict with her in a much more respectful way these days but it aint easy as my emotional needs are often unmet. It's a dialectic again, how much do I need to accept her insensitivity (lets call a spade a spade) vs how much can I change this relationship to be more fulfilling? Not sure on the answers ."

He used my internal self loathing thoughts against me and I just thought, that's bullshit. Also, I couldn't justify my own moral system anymore when I hated myself. I am someone who believes in the inherent value of all beings and their rights to dignity, respect etc. I had to extend that to myself as well in order to live by what I believe to be true. Those things shifted the self hatred a lot for me and I've been more protective of myself, forgiving of myself, kind to myself etc. You just need to find a way to make self compassion fit for you, I guess. It's not easy And i don't act in self compassionate ways all the time or with ease, it's more a conscious effort over time."

My mother is a supportive person in my life,  even though she has a lot of trauma herself & doesn't always get it right. But yeah I think with histories of abuse, you're sooo used to subjugating your own needs automatically if they appear to conflict with someone else's. Abusers have conditioned us to do that. I know it's something i struggle with.  


My ""a ha!"" moment was in a therapy group when one of the therapists said, ""you can make any request of anyone, *because they can always say no if they can't do it*"" I had to ask her to repeat herself as this blew my mind. I would tie myself in knots before asking anyone for anything, thinking am I being reasonable etc? My ex was a domestic violence perpetrator and he used to punish me if I made any request of him re the way he treated me, spoke to me, etc. He wasn't the first to make me feel like my needs were not even worth stating, or even dangerous to state.


So, yeah fuck it. If we need something, we should ask! :)"
CPTSD,f0has0g,t3_d4i6af,1568617046.0,"Not feeling victorious, but I took my own needs seriously and took a break. So for me,  a classic people pleaser, that probably is a victory. It took a mini breakdown and a bad decision, but my mind was determined to send me a message. Despite suffering from massive trauma following separation from a domestic violence perpetrator only 4 weeks ago, I was pushing myself to maintain my stressful full time job and look after myself on my own at home. I found out employers must make accommodations for victims of domestic violence under new national employment standards (timely for me) so I disclosed my situation to my employer and asked for at least 1 week leave. Thankfully they've supported me. My mum lives a fair distance but my rabbit and I have travelled down to stay with her for the next 5 days, which takes a lot of pressure off looking after myself. It's a regional town with lots of forest and beaches, and a Buddhist temple. So, I'm going to try and do some therapeutic time out in peaceful settings. I have a psychologist and I'm also applying for a domestic violence specialist counsellor under a victims of crime scheme I'm eligible for. It's hard, he wasn't my first abuser. This seems to unearthed a lot of stuff and my mind feels shattered. It was a very difficult decision to take this break, I often think about everyone else first (My team at work, my clients at work, making a nuisance, etc.) I was also worried that I'd lose my job, but I'm reassured after looking up my rights. It's such a difficult journey, I've been heartened by the people I've met here and I'm coming here again to be reminded I'm not alone."

ptsd,f09arjr,t1_f07ujzj,1568497203.0,"Thank you, me too. You forget what freedom feels like when you've been in that kind of situation for so frigging long! Even through the pain and trauma, I know I'm free. I think it will take time, too. I'm well supported and I have a coping skills toolkit. I've had mental health issues most of my life, because of early trauma as is usually the case, so I've built a foundation for coping. I've experienced dissociation before, but it was usually when I was being attacked, so in a useful setting! I'm not used to it creeping into daily life like that. I just get exhausted from looking after myself. I need weekends to collapse at the moment. Not drive, work, focus, socialise, act OK! Yesterday's doona day was 100% necessary."
ptsd,f09a09a,t1_f0800q5,1568496773.0,"Thanks. I've been using a lot of mindfulness, as you say, asking myself where I am and what I'm doing. With driving, I've found a few strategies work such as noticing  my foot on the accelerator or brake, naming colours and makes of cars, narrating my steps (""I'm slowing down for the intersection""). Playing trashy celebrity podcasts (guilty pleasure) over music can help ,too as music can trigger emotions and introspection. I get in the car now and tell myself how important it is I stay focused before I start driving. I also do a 5 min meditation before I drive to work now. All this stuff is exhausting! But yeah you got to get through. Especially as I'm in that stage of hating him so much for what he's done and I want to live my best life despite him and to spite him! I'm determined to stay well. Yesterday was a good collapse day though. I didn't have to drive or work or act like I'm ok, it was so cathartic."

survivorsofabuse,ezdmall,t1_ez3fo6j,1567851995.0,"He left me in the end. I had tried to leave a few times earlier in the year and he just kind of pretended that it didn't happen. I felt so vulnerable from the way he was breaking me down, I didn't feel like I had the strength. Earlier attempts to leave when we lived together were stopped by him in various ways. It felt like an impossible task to actually leave,  so I kept asking him to change and we tried couples counselling,  but he manipulated the situation so well that I ended up defending myself against him and the counsellor. Despite this, I got closer to deflecting his attacks on me and calling out his abuse (this was sooooooo hard with a world class manipulator like him) and he either made the call to control the ending of the relationship and take that from me and/or he wanted to punish me by being the one to leave first and make me feel rejected. I'll never know his thinking. Anyway I felt trapped psychologically. I also loved him and I didn't want to believe he could be so calculating and cruel. I deluded myself in various ways,  that sobriety or better mental health treatment or a better job with stop the abuse. It felt safer to not face the truth. I still loved him and the things he did to soothe and put me back together after ripping me to shreds, that was the strongest glue. Stronger than fear.

In terms of the people around me...  His family enabled his abuse of me in many ways such as pretending not to hear him bellow at me, calling me out if I shouted back, telling me to not upset him and even physically stopping me from leaving the house when I was afraid of him.  His behaviour, demeanour, attitudes were so contrary with our friends, his colleagues etc.  He was a ""feminist"" with liberal values and he'd never raise his voice at me in public. He would intimidate me under his breath or by looks no-one else saw. So, honestly the few people I told questioned me by going by their impressions of him. Especially as most had seen his empty outward gestures of romancing or being kind to me. Others didn't understand domestic violence isn't always black eyes. Some asked me to reflect on what I was doing to get him that upset,especially my own mother.

 Only 2 people saw the truth- my dad and one friend. They were gentle, but sadly my father died not long after I told him a few things I'd been hiding about the relationship. My friend said things like, ""He shouldn't feel like he can do that"" and he challenged me a bit when I spoke of hope that my partner would change. I didn't like this, even though it was gentle confrontations. I knew what I wasn't ready to hear, if that makes sense. My friend did witness my partner speak to me in a degrading way, which was odd as my partner rarely revealed that to others. My friend didn't do or say much except ""Are you ok? It's not your fault."" But though he told me later how much the incident worried him,  he didn't address it with me until I had left the relationship. I'm not sure if I would have appreciated it at an earlier point but when we talked about it later, I felt the biggest relief on earth when he said how scary and not ok that was! After how many people ignored or refused to believe me. It's a relief to be believed. Being in such a relationship is like being stuck in smoke & mirrors. You question yourself, your partner, your relationship constantly because it's not just your partner denying that what is happening to you is wrong/undeserved/cruel/harmful, *It is so many others as well*! Including QUOTE professionals UNQUOTE. So where ever she is at in this, validate her experience. If he does something shitty, just say *""that seems like shitty behaviour""*. Be the echo to the voice in her head that says *""you didn't deserve that, that's not ok""*. She needs that voice to not be drowned out and trodden on by every other fuckwit involved in her nightmare.

That said: these relationships can kill women, call your local domestic violence service and discuss your concerns in detail. I don't know the situation so I have no idea what level of risk she is at. Know and have these services on hand for the time when she asks you for help! Leaving can result in legal, logistical, criminal, child custody etc nightmares. Leaving is not easy And can be dangerous ! She may need professional help to do so safely. 

I hope she can leave the shadows and join us safely in the light ❤"

BPD,exsvwmk,t3_cu33tb,1566557998.0,"Look, firstly you need to get your mental health investigated and determine if BPD is what you're struggling with. BPD can look like other things, and other things can look like BPD, you need a licensed mental health professional to determine that. 

However, to answer your question. BPD is not a life sentence. I was diagnosed maybe 2.5 years ago, and I've had intensive therapy over the past 2 years. I kept being incorrectly diagnosed with depression or anxiety disorders for years, and the treatments were shabby. I thought I was doomed to erratic moods, suicidal ideation, impulsivity, rocky relationships because of some deep, unchangeable character flaw. I'm so relieved I was wrong. I'm actually going through an extremely difficult time in my life but I don't think about suicide, I'm not using drugs or alcohol to numb the pain, I'm coping. So, look if it is BPD, there are great possibilities for change with the right programs and treating professionals. 


Do yourself a favour and get diagnosed first though!"
BPD,exsv7e3,t3_cu6fk5,1566557600.0,"Sum of My Parts by Olga R. Trujilo is fantastic. It's not an easy book to read, if you read in full. You can skip chapters which contain descriptions of some of the violence she experienced, these chapters are incredibly confronting. However, she's an amazing person and an inspiration, and she explains her experience of the disorder very well."
BPD,exsunz3,t3_cu7rlz,1566557188.0,"MY LIFE! Look, honestly it depends. For me, part of my recovery process has been a Big, Hard, Long evaluation of the people in my life. I was around very invalidating people, and they were invalidating for many reasons- my ex was abusive, my 'best friend' is in too much chaos herself, my mum has issues. For some people in my life, I have had to face the truth of who they are as a friend/partner/family member. I realised with some I was expecting something that was actually out of character and out of pattern for them. For example, my best friend. I was reflecting, why do I keep expecting her to act differently? Often she is very dismissive or distant when I talk about my feelings, that's actually who she is. I'm in a vulnerable spot right now, and I've actually had to tell her I need space from her. So, I mean if this person has a pattern of invalidating you, maybe it's time to step back and think about the relationship and what it's adding (or minus-ing) from your life. 


If, on the other hand, this person is usually appropriate in how they respond to you and seem capable of contemplating another person's feelings, then it might be about telling them you found their response invalidating. You can do that respectfully. No-one's perfect and they might genuinely not know that you were upset by that response. ""It's not that bad"" is a pretty common response, and usually it's because they want us to feel better. It just doesn't work that well haha"
BPD,exsu0ya,t3_cu46ir,1566556640.0,"Yeah, I had these kind of feelings about my ex. We only broke up 6 days ago so I am in a woooorld of discomfort, let me tell you. He was emotionally abusive, and so he definitely dialed up my vulnerability, making him more addicted to his comfort. So, I guess working on your vulnerability is one thing, you said somewhere down the page you're doing DBT (great!). Self reflection is definitely key. I've learned more about my history and where these feelings of deep, deep, bone deep insecurity are coming through. I had attachment trauma very young, and compounding traumatic experiences. Even though my ex was not technically safe, he felt 'safer' than many other men I'd been around. Part of it was 'devil you know'! Anyway, in his absence, I've had to do a lot of stuff to manage all the stress in my body. I felt like I had a pretty much 4 day panic attack after it ended. I've been using weighted blankets, lots of warm baths, heat packs, etc for sensory comfort. I've also used meditation audio and calming music. Mindfulness skills are bonza once you master them, it takes a LOT of DBT before it makes sense where to use mindfulness skills. Positive self talk, too, like *I* can handle this, *I* am all I need. Hope this helps."
BPD,exsteia,t3_ctzgd1,1566556100.0,"Yelling isn't OK behaviour. It sucks you have to put up with it in your workplace. Are these people customers or co-workers? There's different ways to deal with both. Customers, you can certainly try to seek some guidance around shutting down verbal abuse and what your company's policy is, etc. Co-workers is a bit harder, especially if they are in positions of authority, but there may be ways to assert yourself in a respectful way that will reduce the likelihood of it happening again. Not sure the context, but there must be some supports. It's OK to feel angry if someone does something out of line like yell at you, so don't pathologise yourself for that! But there may be ways to shut the behaviour down effectively so you can do your job without taking so much crap."
BPD,exsszx7,t3_cu2iic,1566555752.0,"Look, I mean I wouldn't necessarily say it's ""gaslighting"" as that's about trying to convince someone their perception of reality is false.  However, I'd say what you're doing is a harmful style of communication, but it's not in the same realm as gaslighting. My ex was emotionally abusive, and he often would tell me I'm doing things to harm him. It was extremely painful to have my positive intentions put into doubt. He was doing this for a different reason than you are, he was actually just distracting me from questioning his abusive behaviour. So, I mean, I wouldn't say your behaviour is necessarily helping your relationship, but you seem to be able to admit that (which abusers never do) and that's a start to making things better. If you're really worried about how this is affecting him, ask. Not in a ""try to make me feel better"" way, but in a genuine way, ask him when you are feeling calm, ""when I say these things, how does it make you feel?"" This might help you guys figure out better ways of meeting each other's needs."
BPD,exssdl7,t3_cub9yx,1566555222.0,"Yeah, my long term relationship just ended as well.

I'm in the same boat though of questioning, will I ever have a happy relationship? I've had so many riddled with problems. The only thing you can do is learn from the experience. I'm scared sometimes I'm too messed up to have a good relationship and I'm terrified of being in another abusive one, honestly it keeps me awake at night. But, I mean, what can you do? I'm working on my therapy and my self care for now. One day at a time <3"

And it's so hard when you think someone might be in that situation. I'm fresh out of an abusive relationship, and there were times people said things to me like, ""I'm afraid he's going to hurt you more"" and ""you deserve to be treated better"" and I just couldn't hear it. It was jarring because I knew something was wrong, but I was living in two minds about it, and it felt like a splitting and I couldn't handle it. Those conversations caused me discomfort, but I didn't really think about them until I was already out of the situation & could face the truth of it. I've also been on the other end, where I've known women in abusive relationships and I've said something or not said something, it didn't really make a huge difference. if you were kind to her, she probably knew you were someone you might have been able to turn to, but she would not have heard you challenge the relationship if she wasn't ready to :("
domesticviolence,exsr30e,t3_cmr5vy,1566554032.0,"My ex is abusing his parents. I don't know how his mother feels, I don't think she knows that's what's happening to her. I lived with him and his parents for a number of years, before they wanted me to move out. They were often complicit in his abuse of me. He was often screaming at me, and when I screamed back, his parents would berate me (never him) and tell me not to upset him. When I ran out the door to escape his screaming, I got scolded for ""always running away"" and at times stopped and asked to stay because ""he's so upset."" His mother pressured me to stop seeing my therapist when I was learning that what I was experiencing was abuse & standing up for myself. However, they were also subject to his screaming attacks and the more subtle manipulations. Last time I saw his dad, his dad told me ""we are just trying to keep him calm. Everything to keep him calm."" This included paying for all his car costs (bar petrol), and organising the registration, maintenance etc. Cooking his breakfast and bringing it to him in bed, trying to get him up in time for his work at the university. Cooking him dinner every night. Organising his medications. Purchasing him clothes, shoes and other necessities. They also paid for a cleaner to do his area once a week. In return he was asked to pay something miniscule like $20/week, but he would run out of money by the end of the week and his mum would give him $100. They were getting ill, his mother with terminal cancer and his dad with rheumatoid arthritis. There were so many times I was shocked by how disconnected my ex seemed from their reality. He only mentioned his mother dying when it was used to win an argument against me. One thing his parents were super conscious of, being both immunity compromised, was keeping sick people out of their house. A cold or flu could really threaten their health majorly. I remember recently he had a drinking buddy over, sniffling, coughing everywhere etc. My ex had no thought about this and they rarely challenged him on anything he did wrong, to an absurd extent. I was gently encouraged and told not to come over if I was sick, and I followed this, including getting yearly flu vaxes. He only remembered his flu vax this year and I'm sure he was thinking about himself, not them, when he got it. Their lives revolve around him & it's like, to him, they exist for the purposes of his caretaking alone. I came over once, and his mother was in a nervous state. I noticed his dad wasn't there. I asked him why. Fairly non-chalantly my ex said his dad was in hospital with an infection around his heart, and only days earlier they thought he had had a heart attack. He was cleared but very ill. My dad had died of his first heart attack a year prior to this, and before I knew how serious it was, I was crying, in a daze and on my way to the hospital. My ex talked to me *the day of* what looked like his father had had a heart attack and was laughing and chatting with me on the phone like normal. I guess my point is, sons can abuse their parents, I witnessed it. He treated them with the same disregard and disrespect as he treated me, but they were more far more 'trained' I suppose to take it. I was a fighter, hence why I'm not around anymore. I feel sorry for them."
domesticviolence,exsq2cq,t3_co8ch0,1566553100.0,"Absolutely agree with you. I only just seperated from my ex, who was emotionally & verbally abusive. The first 4 days I was gasping for air periodically, and my heart was beating my ears. I'm now in a calmer state, but cannot touch coffee or any other stimulant, and I often feel the flutter in my chest. i explained it to my therapist like, my body feels like I'm going to die without him but my head knows that's not true. It's so hard. I feel depleted in body and soul. As soon as the relationship was over, I developed a nasty flu and lost my voice for a day and a half. Just the stress finally breaking. The stress of not being about to save the relationship no matter how hard I tried, and it eating my self worth, energy, motivation in life.

I kept hoping if my ex (pick one!) found a fulfilling career/ stopped using drugs & alcohol so much/ took his medication regularly & saw a psychiatrist/ saw his psychologist more often, he would stop abusing me. I've just read the chapter on myth busting and it's sad but a relief to know none of these were going to work. If I tried to provide him more emotional support & boost his self esteem, that wasn't going to stop him from abusing me. His own mother regularly tries starting him on various vitamins that she thinks will stop him from abusing her. I took a breath, and I could see that *I* wasn't going to fix the relationship or him because *he* didn't want to change. I think he did manipulate our couples counselor well, and I can see how he only used his own therapy to find more sophisticated explanations for why *I* was the crazy one.

I know is probably hard to hear, and it sounds like you depended on him very much. But you can find strength within yourself. I never thought I could, but I did. Focus on your recovery as best you can, it really can get better!"
BreakUp,exedbku,t3_cqfape,1566210486.0,"Yeah, 2 and a half days for me! It's agony, complete agony! I only had my first full meal an hour ago. I'm 29, so age doesn't really cushion that initial blow. It's still painful as hell. But I will try to save you some time, because with age comes some wisdom haha. It sounds like she is resolute, and you are best using your energy to accept this. A lot of the pain is fighting against the reality that the relationship is over. Every now & then through the day, I do a little Buddhist thing & open my hands and say to myself, ""the relationship is over and it had to end."" I was fighting for the relationship really, really hard for the last 3 months, trying to change all of the reasons that it wasn't going to work. I couldn't and I am exhausted fighting against reality. Reality always wins. There's so much grief and the loss feels like torture, so it's not like you accept it the first time you say to yourself that you will. You just have to keep choosing to accept it, until you actually do. Hope this helps."
BPD,execrnf,t1_exec480,1566209680.0,"BPD is so hard without the right treatment. But it's also important to consider that coping with your S/O's unmanaged mental illness is really hard as well. I think I may have mentioned above my former S/O has serious mental illness but he wasn't taking his medications consistently or putting work into managing his symptoms. I knew my S/O was suffering when he treated me in the most unloving ways, but it still hurt me and wore away at trust, joy & intimacy in the relationship. It sounds like you're coming across some barriers to treatment, but you're trying. Focus on getting yourself the right help."
BPD,exec2a3,t1_exdhnx2,1566208695.0,"I'm sorry you're going through this :( please stay safe as best you can. Whatever you need to do to get through the hours. Unfortunately a S/O can never be the first and only support on a safety plan, but I do understand how much services let pwBPD down."
BPD,exb7uap,t1_ex9qsrx,1566125097.0,"Thank you, you'll get there. I've felt that way in the past and I have threatened self harm because no contact literally felt like death. I mean, it still does, this is agony but I have me. I didn't have enough in myself to hold and soothe the distress in the past. It's like a buoy to hold on to in stormy ocean. It's learnable! Wishing you the best x"
BPD,exb7l00,t1_exavwgw,1566124921.0,Thank you. These messages are a light in the dark for me ❤️
BPD,ex9q5ba,t1_ex8c270,1566092723.0,"Look I understand that through & through. Even though I knew this relationship needed to end, I am not ashamed to admit I tried everything short of restraining him to make him stay yesterday (minus some of the more serious things like, threatening to kill myself, etc. Did not do that, told myself ""NO"" every time to the thought entered my head). I wanted to drive to his house, I wanted to call him 22 times (which I have done in the past). I knew it wouldn't help. Once he left, I knew I couldn't follow him this time. He made it very clear. I writhed around in bed hyperventilating, vomiting, feeling hot and cold, like I was coming off a drug. I was like that ALL NIGHT. I had to do a lot of self care stuff to get a few fitful bursts of sleep. I am trying to keep my body healthy as best I can. BPD attachments are hardcore. But, you know I am not beating myself up about that or calling myself crazy for it. I understand it. It wouldn't make sense to a lot of people, but I get it and I'm not ashamed of it. I want to do better in the future, and I know I can. This relationship was really one of those unfinished business pieces in my recovery."
