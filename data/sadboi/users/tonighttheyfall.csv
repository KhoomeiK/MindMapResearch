depressionregimens,fcnprar,t1_fcnne1z,1577816126.0,"i was on 75mg of effexor, and i wasn't a huge fan of it. my doctor did describe them like siblings so i went from 75mg to 37.5mg and 25mg of pristiq for a week now im on 50mg. the weird thing for me was i never felt bad missing a dose of the effexor but i do with pristiq.

as for cost i am very very very lucky and on my fathers very good insurance so price isn't too big of an issue for me when i switch medication. last we talked we were going to look at possibly putting me on a mood stabilizer as well. 




previous medication:
Prozac, 20mg and 40mg
Wellbutrin, 150mg, 300mg, and 450mg
AtomoxetineÂ  30mg 
Lexapro 10mg
Hydroxyzine HCL 25mg as needed for sleep and anxiety
TRazodone 50mg as needed for sleep
Venlafaxine ER 75mg"
