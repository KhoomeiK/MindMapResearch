depression,fllrs6h,t1_fllre25,1585266434.0,"Start ups pay very little here on average. I’ve worked for starts up before and they make you work over time with no pay and they were not good environments for me. Also, you can buy a keyboard for cheap.  Big companies usually have stringent guidelines unless you are just perfect for the job so yeah can’t do anything about that."
depression,flln0f1,t1_fllm6ab,1585263676.0,"I'm trying to learn piano and FL Studio, but that will get me nowhere. I'm tired of waiting I’ve been talking to this one company for three months. I was so close I don’t want to do all that work again. I just can’t; it’s so hard for me. I just do not have any fight left; I was fighting so hard. I'm going to be working in a pyramid scheme or as a waiter, janitor, or whatever and not even making enough to pay my debts."
depression,fl6xugl,t1_fl6xtq9,1584887238.0,also what do you like to do for pleasure. is there anything that stands out.
depression,fl6xtq9,t1_fl6wxat,1584887215.0,You should set an animal crossing date night! I feel like you'll be more motivated to play in person. I know maybe that is rough to do because of COVID-19 but maybe you could face time or get on discord. Talking while playing animal crossing is a great pass time.
depression,fl6vm6r,t1_fl6v8vb,1584884729.0,Still I would talk to someone about this. Having these thoughts are not okay.
depression,fl6vij9,t1_fl6v2hk,1584884646.0,"Hey, it’s okay you’re not bothering me at all. I would rather you have someone to talk to. I want you to do these things for me, okay. 
-Breathe through pursed lips.
-Breathe slowly into a paper bag or cupped hands.
-Attempt to breathe into your belly (diaphragm) rather than your chest.
-Hold your breath for 10 to 15 seconds at a time. 

Now listen, do not let your past dictate your future okay. All that stuff that happened does not make you a bad a person. What makes you a good person is the fact you changed yourself for the better and are trying to improve yourself everyday. You are not a bad person. You are loved. You can do this!"
depression,fl6ux9i,t3_fmzkud,1584884143.0,Please I don't want you to go
depression,fl6uo52,t1_fl6u5e4,1584883925.0,The best way to deal with depression is to be with those people. You don't have to funny for people to like you. You should tell them how you feel and they can help you. Are you currently seeing anyone to talk about your depression and suicidal thoughts? People go through rough times and that is why we are here to help you.
depression,fl6tdmm,t3_fmzkud,1584882765.0,I’m reading this post and want to say I’m here for you. I don’t want you to go away. You don’t deserve that and people love you. Please.

The word chronic means it’s there for good. Luck is not on my side here. I know you are trying to be all “everyone is good and positive vibes everywhere” but I hate to burst your bubble. But some people aren’t meant to  have great lives. They have great lives and have the ability to make them better but I don’t. It pisses me off and apparently it’s toxic to feel this way. To just be mad at the world. To be mad at people who have the power to better their lives and the world but I  don’t. The fact that there are rapist, pedophiles, murders, criminals, corrupt politicians, mass shooters, and many more who are in good health. Yet me a 22 year old who has done nothing but just try and exercise eat right and try and be positive cannot just have a normal life. For some reason I’m toxic. I understand what you are trying to do and I get it and I implore you keep trying, but not right now. You cannot fix this. Sorry."

If they offer a course that is at a community college that can be transferred over here take it. As long as you make a C I believe (which I’m sure you don’t) it will count and it does not affect your GPA. Since you are not in UH in 4, you can go nuts and take however many classes you need to take. Idk if this accounting is offered anywhere but I hope this helps in someway."

depression,f4y39oj,t1_f4qqe0k,1571871924.0,"Answer to your questions

1) No: my brain and my face are fucked up 
2) If people talk to me on their own which they don’t 
3) Because there is a distinct difference in the quality of life I'm living 
4)No
5)No

Thoughts for you: Saying that I have more choices than a man in debt with a mortgage and kids makes me feel like an asshole for complaining and is more reason why I should not be alive. Also, how can you tell me what to do? Do you have depression or mental illness? It sounds like you’re living a beautiful ass life. What are YOUR struggles, dude? Do you have any struggles? Please talk to me when you feel like sharing, and thank you for making me feel worse."

I do have a suggestion, but I feel like I would be going to the territory of the stupid positive person trying to help you who does not have depression kind of thing.
