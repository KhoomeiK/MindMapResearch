FCInterMilan,f77zzt0,t3_durkhe,1573481451.0,"Knowing Lazio they will expect tons of cash for him again. It‘s a difficult one and depends on how we handle the situations of Mertens, Sanchez and Politano"
discordapp,f77pxlf,t3_dud0m2,1573470197.0,Surprised i didn‘t accidentally call someone yet. You‘re right this should be placed differently
SuicideWatch,f77pw30,t3_dum0fw,1573470130.0,I am unable to run away from myself so this isn’t an option for me

socialanxiety,f5yo3y0,t3_dpo311,1572559190.0,"Literally all the time, and it‘s somehow always just me. The hell is wrong with me"
socialanxiety,f5w5vlk,t1_f5u770n,1572515061.0,I feel you. I used to have lots of female friends but lately i haven't even been trying to make new ones for whatever reason
battlestations,f5w5qcj,t3_dpbqtp,1572514928.0,Very clean look. These are my favourites

EDM,f5nlk4u,t1_f4e7zmw,1572301579.0,"Don‘t mind Heldens in there either, he has been dropping some good stuff lately"

discordapp,eyoljxp,t1_eyoc8kq,1567279078.0,Being permanently invisible just makes me more comfortable cause i feel like people that message me don't expect an instant reply i guess
socialanxiety,eykmqve,t3_cx8rzb,1567160026.0,That is legit one of the worst. Probably cause you have so much time to overthink everything and how you are gonna say it

SuicideWatch,ey73p6n,t3_cvubk9,1566870979.0,Yes. I used to self-diagnose myself with lots of diseases just because i felt a symptom for a while and of course my brain played tricks on me and suddenly i felt the others too. Yet never anything serious came out of it. The actually serious diseases and illnesses came out of nowhere
FCInterMilan,ey6cetf,t3_cvtp3b,1566852351.0,The rebirth of Candreva! Loving it

FCInterMilan,ey26b7j,t3_cv1fzz,1566726935.0,"I have a rather odd reason. Black and blue are my favourite colours, so i decided to start a career mode on Fifa 12 with Inter Milan.
For whatever reason the team grew on me more and more and i fell in love with it. My dream is to see them live at the San Siro once"
SuicideWatch,exykhcj,t3_cuiinz,1566653280.0,"I think it's amazing that a hotline like this exists and is ready to help people at all times but as you said i could never see that working for me. I know that the person doesn't care about me, no emotions involved whatsoever and that alone makes it worthless to me"
discordapp,exk2xsm,t1_exk2qsv,1566370355.0,I'm not sure how anyone here could help you with this as we have no chat logs to prove anything. I'd recommend messaging the Discord Support again to clarify what you have been banned for

Absurdism,ex0uuvb,t1_eveiny0,1565922778.0,"I'm pretty sure this was just a reference to the sarcastic saying ""Why are you mad? They are just pixels on your screen""."
psychology,ewxuemu,t3_cqnrre,1565868594.0,"In my opinion finding a partner through dating apps can make you more comfortable, however people often don’t show their true selves. On a face-to-face setup you have to be spontaneous and show your flaws, while online you can prepare your answers (eliminating a lot of anxiety issues) and make yourself seem like a person you aren’t. I could see that leading to many misunderstandings and problems when the 2 finally meet up face-to-face."
FCInterMilan,ewljbqb,t1_ewliv8w,1565526589.0,Lol. I guess Reddit has no mercy there
FCInterMilan,ew73ek8,t3_cn5thk,1565185500.0,Bastoni as additional center back cover
FCInterMilan,ew420kf,t1_ew40pzl,1565100952.0,Since you know nothing about him how can you come to that conclusion then? Not every good transfer is a big money signing
FCInterMilan,euby6v1,t1_eubxbs4,1563659974.0,Considering how Perisic perfromed as left back last season when he was needed i was a bit surprised aswell. I thought he always did a decent enough job
