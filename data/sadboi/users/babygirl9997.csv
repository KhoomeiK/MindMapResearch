BPD,fptliyq,t1_fps87jy,1588893509.0,"Definitely an internet phenomenon, for whatever reason. Perhaps the internet thinks the “clingy girl stereotype” is cute. 
Like OP I didn’t even hear of this disorder until 5 years ago when my diagnosis changed to “cluster b personality disorder” and I was like wtf is *this*. No one ever explained until I went to a psych ward and the doctor there explained. 

Not a single person in real life things this is a cute or charming aspect of me. They think when I have challenges with some of the things related to the symptoms of BPD (for me it’s predominantly rage and then guilt or black/ white thinking of abandonment) that id just shut the fuck up. It’s not cute and I don’t even want to be the way I am."

I think that while hurting people isn’t okay, and where you have BPD or not everyone hurts people as long as you make up for it and correct your wrongs you are the bigger person and can effectively learn and heal.

For me personally as someone who has experiences with psychosis that was in the form of paranoia, what made me realize I needed help was I was ducking terrified. I don’t know what really prompted me to tell my doctor at the time, maybe I thought I could trust her. It really takes one “safe” person to be able to recognize you need help."

askpsychology,fowtqx0,t1_fowdqz6,1588126960.0,"I also have PTSD so I’ve had those experiences aside from the psychosis. I suppose it’s sort of similar, though when I’m having an experience of having the dissociation, I usually don’t have anything on my mind and tune out. For example.

Paranoia about the fbi: that disconnected feeling followed by not knowing where I am anymore and me sometimes staring at a vent or smoke alarm because there is 100% a camera in it, taking apart that to make sure there isn’t a camera, pacing back and forth because I looked out the window and saw someone watching me, telling myself or anyone around me  “we’re all going to die/ it isn’t safe/ we need to leave”, possibly self harming because I am convinced there is a bug in my skin, then sometimes sitting in my room with pepper spray and the door locked just sitting there waiting for the fbi to show up, not using electronics because “they are listening”.

People think of psychosis as this really weird thing, and it isn’t. The reason I have these experiences is because my brain for whatever reason processes anxiety in the sense of paranoia about the fbi. The more anxiety I have about mundane things, the more severe the paranoia. Recently, the pandemic has not helped. 


The derealization/depersonalization any other time: just sitting and staring at a wall when I think about my trauma or nothing at all.

Edit: When I was in teens and doing the med roulette, I’d be up for hours at night because I couldn’t sleep it would keep me awake I’d be so scared. Now this happens maybe like 2 hours max a few times a week. Voices are everyday, but not constantly. That I don’t have this different dimension feeling. That is something a different experience."
askpsychology,fow28cj,t3_g5yu7k,1588111666.0,"I have had schizoaffective for a decade. My first psychotic episode happened when I was 14, which is extremely rare. - not sure if this follows the rules of the sub so delete if not allowed.

I had just started my freshman year of high school. I probably had signs of mental illness before this, but the problem with schizophrenia is those “negative” symptoms often mask depression, so that’s what everyone thought it was. I had self harmed prior to this but it wasn’t really super significant. 

My friends and I were going to a concert and it was October and it was snowing. My mom drove me to my friends house and I just knew someone was watching/ following us. I started screaming at my friends that I wasn’t safe and I had to immediately go home. I ended up trying to walk home in a snowstorm in October with high heeled boots on, no jacket because I was so sure that someone was trying to kill me. My mom ended up picking me up and I didn’t tell her any of this happened, just that I had a panic attack.

Because I didn’t know what was going on, I didn’t tell anyone what was happening. About a year later after seeing a psychiatrist for anxiety I had a complete breakdown in her office and told her I thought 2 government agents were following me. Medicine was given. I tried to cut “bugs” or tracking devices out of my skin that weren’t there. Hospital 1 happened. Hospital 2-6 followed shortly after. I began to feel there were cameras in the vents, tracking devices in my skin, water and food poisoned, and people I loved were spies. Eventually, I began hearing voices tell me when these FBI agents were coming then other voices tell me commands like to kill myself, or that I was stupid and worthless. I also see things. During this time, I didn’t leave the house for about 3 years. Couldn’t go to school, and if I did go to school I sat in the guidance counselors office all day because I couldn’t function due to the psychosis or the meds would cause awful side effects to the point where I couldn’t talk or walk. 

Somehow I went from being a straight A student with tons of friends to losing everything and spending my teenage years in a psych ward, drugged and discarded.

The good news is there’s a happy ending. At 16 my dr told my mom that she should just give up on me and find a group home because my prognosis was grave, but my mom said fuck that. switched my doctors and I’m a functioning person again. Still have symptoms, but I’m not doped up on meds and have a life with a purpose. Recently graduated college, have a SO, friends and am glad I’m here. 

TL;DR- experiences with psychosis

Edit: to describe what it actually feels like: it feels like you’re in another dimension. You’re here... but not really. You can here someone talking to you, know where you are then the next minute you don’t. Paranoia will build up to the point where eventually it consumes you and then you’re just not focused on anything but the experiences happening to you. It’s terrifying."

I never told another person but him and my psychologist- and I had only told him because I thought I could see myself with him long term. That being said, there was a lot of communication involved in me asking to tell him, and making sure he was ready to hear those things. While it is about your comfort level, definitely making sure your SO is mentally okay to be able to handle that conversation. I’ve realized since opening up, I make a lot of comments (not jokes but I’ll casually bring it up) and it’s uncomfortable for him.

Eventually when I did recover because my mom was like fuck you to community mental health, my life improved.

bipolar,fjpu09p,t3_feq0sh,1583560770.0,"I was on lithium- 600mg then switched to topamax. My psychiatrist allowed me to cut the lithium at one point because I wanted to go off of it, I had been diagnosed with BPD after being diagnosed w schizoaffective recently when i did that and it was not good so i stayed on it. Eventually switched to topamax to lose weight. Now I am stable so I domt have any meds besides the topamax, which I have gone off of before but I am on now for weight loss mainly

Edit I didnt finish what i typed: it may be helpful to keep a mood journal. When i was going off of meds I was having random crying spells and couldnt figure out why. The decreasing the lithium was a reason in conjunction with the unstable BPD. You know yourself so be mindful of your emotions.

Edit 2: I'm someone with schizoaffective who really never had any mania and my depression is really what influenced everything, and my manic episode was just an increase in psychosis. Decreasing the lithium made my depression so much worse but it can do that for you or produce mania."

In my experience I turned down the masters positions and decided to reapply for the doctoral programs next year after revising my resume/gre/etc. However it may be up to you to decide what is the best course of action. Personally, it wasn't worth it to me to do the masters.

Edit: in many doctorate programs you earn your masters along the way so the masters may not help you before applying.

Edit 2: I myself got a BA in psychology so no thesis, however I worked in several different labs, none of them really focused on psych at all. I think that if you can tailor your personal statement in a way that shows your dedication but gain experience in research more (doesnt even have to still be in the lab your in) it can be an advantage. More so you just need to explain how you got to the path you're choosing."

I had experience volunteering with the homeless and then working with peer support in terms of educating youth on mental health in puvlix schools and presenting at peer support conferences on youth peer support. currently I'm working on a project to get a bill passed to make mental health education required in my state- none if this I had when I applied so I couldn't write about it.

After I had applied I realized that my research interests align with focusing on schizophrenia in males /male survivors child sexual assault  which I didnt write about. In my statement I sort of went from like jumping around to talking about how I wanna work work psychosis to child sexual assault to DBT to other shit so I think for myself if I narrowed it down itll be a little more clear cut. so I don't know hopefully that combined with my now 3.6 GPA and the GRE will make me competitive for next year.

You are allowed to cry. You are allowed to be upset. You worked hard. What you aren't allowed to do is give up. If your goal is to become a school psychologist and you cannot see yourself doing *anything* else, you need to simply figure out what went wrong. Study for the GRE some more, gain more experience, talk to other school psych people and see what they did, revise the personal statement and your resume, etc. Use this as a motivation tool to be a more competitive applicant next year.

My boyfriend (who doesnt have any mental illness actually) is the one who brought this up and weve had discussions on it. I was at a workshop on this and we ended up getting into a discussion on this and quantum physics and the discussion in general of hearing voices mainly because I myself had been talking about how awful and lonely these experiences had been for me. My actual delusions are I have this belief that I'm being stalked by the FBI- that is something that can be proven to not be factual with evidence.
Anyways, the presenter said that overall, we really *could* be in a simulation. He said that you know, even without the schizophrenia/bipolar/ect diagnosis whatever, we don't know what it out there. We just don't.  Furthermore, he started telling a story about a woman he met who was diagnosed with schizophrenia who was having shit move in her house. They kept telling her she was crazy. Set up cameras and everything in her house. Nothing could be found. Shit still moved. I think realistically, what other people say is schizophrenia in certain cases, really could just be this simulation we are in. I think that even in particular when it comes to psychosis in general, doctors (usually bad ones) are very quick to jump something as a ""delusion"". With my particular delusion for example, that is something that is highly unlikely. But for other people, that's something different. Say you said something about this theory to a dr, they would 100% tell you you're delusional, when in fact you're really not."

xxfitness,fir7j4x,t3_f9da9a,1582658923.0,"I am 4'11. I battled (and still do) a nasty eating disorder  and schizophrenia which caused restricting, then as a result of antipsychotics I gained about 90 pounds. My highest weight was 190. Currently I am 145. I want to say it's been roughly 2 years or so since I've started working out in the gym, prior to my mental health issues I was doing ballet 4 times a week, which is how I was able to stay as thin as I did.

To lose the weight now,  I was doing a bunch of cardio and weight lifting to start. I had no idea what I was doing lifting wise but eventually figured it out. It got easier and I got stronger. Look up people on instagram and youtube, that's helpful.  Cardio- when I first started I did 30- 45 min every time, including weight training. 5x / week. Now I do it maybe 1-2x a week. It certainly can help in terms of weight loss, but if you don't enjoy it, don't do it. Dont kill yourself doing something you hate because you think it's something you're ""supposed to do"". Eating is what really is the main thing. My big thing was when I first started the weight loss process was I didn't know how to cook. Pinterest is your friend. Making things like slow cooking/crockpot recipes you can make for the week on sundays and freeze for the week is your best bet (at least mine is due to mental illness). That, and if you're busy like myself, this can be helpful because the last thing I want to do is cook a meal at 7:30 PM.

Another thing I want to add that I have been finding that is beneficial is scheduling the gym for a time that is going to work for you. My huge problem was like ""oh yeah I am going to be one of those people who gets up at 5am and goes to the gym before my 8am class"". I dread mornings. Instead, I go on weekends when my boyfriend works on his car. Think of the gym time as your ""me"" time instead of ""I have to do this or I'm going to be overweight forever"" because then you're beating yourself up and realistically, the gym can be a great outlet for mental health too if that is a thing you struggle with as well.  Hope this helps!

Edit: if you can, possibly see a dietician. I saw one after I hit a 6 month plateau where I lost no weight for 6 months."

Would you recommend in this gap year shooting for clinical or research experience in terms of work experience? I have 2 yrs of research experience, currently working on a paper (possibly getting started on another). 6 months of volunteering in a homeless shelter, and I do a lot of work with peer support (currently what my internship is). I'd like to work with psychosis as a career goal.

schizoaffective,fik8fxz,t3_f89e7k,1582475160.0,"I smoked weed. I developed early onset schizophrenia, I was 13. My first hospitalization someone had taken too many tabs of acid and had a similar experience, though their symptoms were most positive whereas my symptoms were and continue to be always negative. Regardless,  you shouldn't put blame yourself. I think you were bound to probably develop this disorder genetically. This is probably the case for all, if not most of us.

Edit: no one does any type of drug and goes ""huh you know what, I hope I get high and develop schizophrenia, that sounds like tons of fun!"". People do drugs for all types of reasons, I mean I wouldn't personally recommend doing it again but don't think you somehow cause this. Please be well.

sex,fiebp42,t3_f7kxdv,1582377261.0,"Before I met my current SO I had partners who would not eat me out. I had mixed feelings about sex because I really didn't understand women were supposed to enjoy it too (I have sexual trauma so that was a factor). As I got older I did start to demand orgasms and oral, hook ups or dating. If they did not do those things first and wanted to have PIV- I'd simply get up and leave. It is a two way street. My current partner is very enthusiastic, our first date he said ""I can't eat too much before I eat"" at dinner and i knew he was a keeper. He himself wasn't always like this though he admitted when he was in college he was selfish but got better, I agree with other people it comes with age /maturity. Talking about what you like before is important. Receiving oral/orgasm first is important. Also from personal experience, don't date someone who doesn't give you orgasms. They will not change.

Edit: it isn't a you thing, we live in a patriarchal society

Edit: didn't take any pain meds or anything either. I immediately had sex a few hours after too and it was fine.

Edit 2: if you (or anyone) is considering having the paragard, what I did see a difference in for the 2nd insertion was the heaviness in periods. My 2nd insertion my period is more heavy.

This isn't a normal part of my experiences by the way, my paranoia typically involves the FBI and I'm pretty good at knowing by now I'm not a target.

That being said, things were worse for me before they got better. You might need to just keep trying. However. You need to stop smoking weed and abusing substances. That is going to harm you. That isn't making you more creative, that is contributing to your paranoia without you realizing it. 

You can find a life worth living, if journalism is what you want to do then having psychosis certainly shouldn't stop you. Sure, this may be a slight hiccup while you take some time to manage your mental health, but you shouldn't give up on your dreams. I know it's hard to think of it like that. If it's any help at all, when I had first started showing symptoms I did not think I'd be alive to see my 18th birthday and here I am 10 years later entering a career I have found myself wanting to do mainly because of the way my life turned out.

Edit: I myself have been caused harm by many professionals, hence why I am becoming a clinician so I can change the field myself I found an article for you. This might be a good place to start. I just want to add, that clinicians by law have to document everything that happens (they are called progress notes) so it may be difficult to win in if a lawsuit does happen.

Edit: I will add that, if she did say ""agree to disagree"" that is very much client negligence because that is not the way to handle it. Schizophrenia or not. The way that schizophrenia can manifest is not accepting you are having these experiences so if you had that diagnosis that was a poor way of going about it and at the very least you should report it."

We seem to only have intimacy problems when he is stressed and it tends to be when he has a poor diet, so I suggested yesterday if he takes care of himself physically that may be a contributing factor to his libido. Like others have said, you two may have to just rule out options before getting tested.

Edit: I wanted to add I also came off as an asshole, and I explained it to him that I felt as though *I* was undesirable. My partner even if we dont have sex is always willing to give me an orgasm, but I explained that sometimes I want to make love, and he said he understood and felt the same."
