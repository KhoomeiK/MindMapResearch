I‚Äôve lost jobs due to my anxiety and have felt that I put no work into making something of my life. Lost a lot of money to drinking/drugs and am trying to piece myself back financially. The only thing I really am proud of is serving in the Air Force for 10 years. Just hoping after years of indecision that I can stop fucking off and finish my bachelors degree. I hate how insidious and deceiving our mental struggle can be. I‚Äôm trying to believe in the fact that the struggle makes us stronger and will pay off someday.

depression,fl4fv85,t3_fmefst,1584812654.0,"Dammit man, my situation feels so much like yours. The feelings of being lost, unsure , inadequate, and seeing all of my friends around me with good careers and a significant other to share their life with.
 
I turned 36 today and have next to nothing going on right now. Had to move in with my mom after pissing away inherited money on drugs/ partying. Worked nothing but dead end jobs, live in constant regret of the recent DUI I got and trying to cope with major depression and anxiety disorder. I have 10 years of military experience which was great but 
I regret not sticking it out and making a career out of it. Finishing my BA soon which is my only glimmer of hope. 

It‚Äôs so hard to look at the people around us and not compare/contrast to where they are at in life with how inadequate we feel. It‚Äôs a major symptom of depression. At least in my eyes. We have to learn to put the blinders on and work on ourselves. 

That‚Äôs awesome that you are looking into an IT program...something that sounds fulfilling from what I hear. Your post actually sounds rather hopeful to me. Even though you may feel like wasted potential, just getting this off your chest means that YOU CARE about accomplishing something. You know that there is fulfillment for you somewhere. Writing is an amazing talent and it‚Äôs something you can always do to keep your mind active on something. 

Wishing you the best , it sounds like you have a plan in place to live out those dreams."
