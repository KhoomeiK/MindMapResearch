BreakUps,flxl60u,t1_fluz427,1585585036.0,"Thank you, kind redditer. I took a moment to respond to this because I really was reflecting on what you were saying. May I ask which videos and books you read?

Yes, that void is so deep. I miss him so much but have reminded myself of all the negative aspects of the relationship as well as how he handled it. I miss having someone to constantly talk to and have tried to fill it by reaching out to friends. However, at night is when I feel so alone. It’s terrifying. I had an idea of what my life would be like and this has turned it upside down. Although it’s scary, I recognize that good will eventually come from this situation. I’ve made a bucket list of items that I want to do once the pandemic is over. These were things I wasn’t able to do with my partner before. I’m excited to learn more about myself.

You are an amazing person and so am I! I look forward to the day that I meet someone that will treasure me as much as I do them. Thank you for your kind words too. I hesitated when you said I was strong because there are times when I don’t feel like it. A memory will come back and I have tears streaming down my face while I eat lunch. I’ve been staring outside my window hoping that I’ll see his car coming down the road to apologize for everything. Sometimes the anxiety and stress is so much I make myself sick and don’t want to get out of bed. However, in this pain there is strength too. I’ve been writing letters to myself with those positive affirmations. I’ve been talking with a therapist to find the right tools. There have even been times when I feel like laughing at my favorite shows again. It’s a day by day process. We’re wounded right now but I know that we will only come out of this stronger, better, and happier people."
BreakUps,fluxp4n,t1_fluw763,1585512206.0,"Thank you. Yes, family and friends have helped. I’ve been seeing a therapist also. The loneliness is the most difficult especially now where you can’t even sit in a restaurant. Heartbreak is awful. Day by day, we’ll make it though."

OnlyChild,fk6ua7j,t3_fgsjxd,1583916450.0,"I’m an only child that was raised by a working class single mom. My grandparents also lived with us. I had an incredible childhood and have deeply close relationships with my cousins and aunts/uncle. The funny thing is that many of my friends never really spoke much of their siblings and it wasn’t until I was older that I realized that they really had any. I know that sounds strange but no one was ever stigmatized for having or not having siblings. My family never treated me like a baby and I was even included in more adult conversations when my cousins with siblings weren’t. I’m an introvert but also enjoy being social at work events, school, and enjoy public speaking. I have better relationships with some of my friends than they have with their own bio siblings. The best part about being an only child during my childhood was that I would get very creative when it came to playing games if my cousins weren’t around and since sometimes my grandparents weren’t physically able to. This creativity has helped me in my professional life to always think outside of the box. Many of the only children I knew as children are all doing quite well in their professional careers as well as mentally and socially. Honestly, it wasn’t until I joined this subreddit that I realized there was even negativity surrounding being an only child. I realize I’ve been incredibly blessed and lucky in my life but also feel that this can be replicated if a parent is willing to create that strong foundation."

Pixar,f9fahbb,t3_e4tafo,1575264343.0,"1. I didn’t like it. I love Pixar and Toy a Story and I feel like they had the perfect ending with the third film. This may be my sentimental side talking but I saw the first Toy Story when I was quite young and the 3rd one came out right as I was preparing to go to college myself. It really hit home and knocked it out of the park for me.

2. Stupid. I feel like they nuked his character. It seemed really out of left field.

3. It did. I expected more from Jesse especially. Everything felt rushed with all the new characters and our oldies. 

4. This was my favorite part of the movie but it seemed as though they were capitalizing on the trendiness women’s empowerment is experiencing right now. Bo in the first movie is more like a love interest character and really isn’t in the second film. The Bo from the 4th movie definitely would’ve gone with everyone to rescue  Woody but I suppose they wanted to put the spotlight on Jesse?

5. 2, 1, 3, 4.

6. I love that little cat ornament from the Christmas specials! He said the funniest things in a deadpanish sorta tone. In the movies proper... Hmm, I’d say Jesse."
