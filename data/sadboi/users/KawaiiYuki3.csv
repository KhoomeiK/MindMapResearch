self,fizuslf,t1_fixxkta,1582875595.0,"I am trying to do research the best I can right now for materials. I heard Neoprene is a good fabric to work with. I haven't found a place near me yet that sells it, but they were also pretty small shops. That fabric is pretty expensive depending on where you get it so I could probably do $8-$10 per mask but it's still a good bargain for now."
self,fixxbvu,t1_fhdnux1,1582828260.0,I like to sew! I just realized that face masks are in high demand. What if I made high quality ones for a reasonable price? Like $3-$5. I don't know if that is reasonable but it's somewhere to start.
self,fig2adq,t1_fi7w9wy,1582395420.0,"No he is not. 
Me and my husband just talked about this yesterday and we agreed that he wasn't staying another night and that he was actually quite pissed that he's been staying to long as well. I guess the conversation meant nothing though because that just didn't happen. I confronted him saying ""so your brother is staying another night "" and the only reply he could give me was ""I guess"" but they never talked about him having to leave. It's as though he just expects him to make the decision to leave. His brother only leaves if he starts a shit show of an argument."
aliens,fhrux0r,t3_f49c1x,1581839892.0," Ok, many theory's
* S.O.S. signal.
* A request for information/situation. 
*Data packages sent via quantum frequency.
I think it could possibly be possibly both the last two. 
More theory's 
*The frequencies are becoming more constant because something is getting closer.
  -Something is looking for someone 
   drastically.
  -UFO taken down by us now being 
   searched for said unidentified flying 
   object or someone/something specific
*Something is coming.
*Something is here.
*Something is not here anymore."

depression,erl6sca,t3_c2fuf3,1560979663.0,I know the feel man. I went to the hospital 3 years ago and got diagnosed with chronic depression and I had been hallucinating from the mix of prescriptions my doctor had me take and 5 days with no sleep. My mom still to this day only sees the money that came from her pocket and doesn't believe me because I told her she was crazy and ran away and never looked back since.
