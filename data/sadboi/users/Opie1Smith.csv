schizophrenia,f9x4upf,t1_f9x3j3t,1575704700.0,Risperdone and Inderal are the same class of AP. They're basically interchangeable from my knowledge.
schizophrenia,f9x3ajg,t1_f9x2pcw,1575703882.0,On goodrx it's 500 dollars a month here but if you've been on a couple of APs and they didn't work your doctor or pharmacist should be able to get a prior authorization from your insurance company.
schizophrenia,f9x332q,t1_f9x2vkj,1575703777.0,I'm respecting you're wishes. I'm just telling you what I make. I can't work. I know this. If you can work then more power to you. I'm actually pretty jealous.

schizophrenia,f9x0s26,t3_e73gjh,1575702534.0,Mine started at 22 after I had my son with my ex. Constant drug and alcohol use plus genetics just made me snap one day and I blacked out. I woke up 3 days later in the hospital managing my alcohol withdrawal and hooked up to a morphine drip for the 4 ribs I had broken somehow. I was chained to the bed with fluffy pink handcuffs and couldn't hug anyone or accept gifts. My father said that a number of people from friends and work came to see me and even with my ex we watched the latest episode of breaking bad together which I don't remember. I was depressed and anxious before I was schizophrenic so in total I've been in treatment for12 years. I am now 28.
schizophrenia,f9x00zs,t3_e7alt6,1575702119.0,When they know of my illness yes because of the stigma. Trust me when I'm not all there it's blatantly obvious that I'm having issues.

schizophrenia,f9wotg3,t3_e76yf1,1575696209.0,My doctor said that's more anxiety based than schizo. I'd ask a mental health professional.
schizophrenia,f9woh6a,t3_e78pjl,1575696037.0,Schizophrenia treatment is generally suppressing the positive symptoms and treating the negative symptoms to a sort of grey area where you function but you're not quite happy about it. We need more drugs like Invega that treat schitzoaffective disorder too.
schizophrenia,f9wo42l,t1_f9wn5dp,1575695857.0,You have a good day mate. I know you'll know what you need to keep yourself sane.

schizophrenia,f9wnqrx,t3_e76s4o,1575695680.0,My therapist and doctor are some of the most caring people I know. Even the pharmacists and receptionists are nice and understanding to me. I never get charged a late fee if I'm freaking out and can't make a session. They take shit from my parents and just keep telling me to keep the blame on them so I don't get into arguments about my care.
schizophrenia,f9wn3n0,t1_f9w5h71,1575695365.0,same
schizophrenia,f9wmyuw,t1_f9wmhox,1575695300.0,Try to reason with your parents. If things get overwhelming call an ambulance. Then you're the hospitals problem and your parents can do fuck all. That's what I had to do when I was 17 and my parents slowly grew to accept I had a problem bigger than depression.
schizophrenia,f9wmp9p,t3_e79ap8,1575695170.0,I had to go to the hospital to withdraw from alcohol and the other drugs I was taking. Consult a doctor or check into a reputable rehab facility.

schizophrenia,f9vs9zu,t3_e76cd3,1575678387.0,There's nothing wrong with having to come home early because you need to increase your meds. It'll be way easier on you the earlier you do something about it than waiting till your at a breaking point.
schizophrenia,f9vrk67,t3_e76fi4,1575677843.0,I feel like this is a nature vs nurture thing. Since your environment will be different you'll be starting new regardless if you try to or not. Being schizo has nothing to do with it. Just give it your best shot. You go brother!
schizophrenia,f9vr5nq,t3_e75p1r,1575677534.0,If you feel like harming people you might want to think about the hospital. I've been there for the same thing and they mellowed me out.

schizophrenia,f9uc6hn,t3_e6z6yk,1575648137.0,Very well done
schizophrenia,f9t3oyx,t1_f9t05bf,1575607801.0,If it only happened that one time I think you're pretty safe. Just relax and know that's the paranoia talking.
schizophrenia,f9syy7g,t1_f9sy7x2,1575604028.0,The back of the brain is where the dopamine is located that drives schizos so APs just block the whole thing. Cigarettes encourage Dopamine in the prefrontal cortex which handles problem solving and mood. Stops your memory and thinking from getting worse. That's part of the reason schizos have such a low life expectancy
schizophrenia,f9sy6vl,t1_f9sxw6v,1575603486.0,73% of schizos are chain smokers. Something about producing dopamine in the frontal cortex to prevent cognitive decline or some other two dollar words. I used to smoke cigs and now I just chew the gum. It has the same effect.
schizophrenia,f9sxt4p,t1_f9swv7v,1575603203.0,The only thing that doesn't give me hallucinations is alcohol but then it negates the effects of my APs and I hallucinate later so it seems like there's no getting around it.
schizophrenia,f9swuai,t1_f9swm6z,1575602508.0,Okay cool my friend. I think we're on the same page with that accelerated theory anyway.
schizophrenia,f9swiqr,t1_f9sw8a2,1575602276.0,I'm not sure how to take this. Are you mad at me for something? I agree with what you wrote. Sorry if I offended you.
schizophrenia,f9svp4f,t1_f9sv6jw,1575601699.0,You can develop it from psychedelics but the chance you will is much higher if you have a genetic predisposition to it.
schizophrenia,f9svhrc,t1_f9suldc,1575601563.0,I hope it helps. It says they prescribe meds and stuff so you should be able to get in there pretty quick as long as you have a webcam.

schizophrenia,f9sokd5,t1_f9snsoz,1575596775.0,My doctor won't give me amphetamines. Supposedly they add more positive symptoms than their worth.
schizophrenia,f9sogl2,t1_f9sn8df,1575596703.0,That would be preferable
schizophrenia,f9sn6e2,t1_f9sm81d,1575595820.0,That's not how APs work. They have to remain at a constant level in your blood stream.
schizophrenia,f9sm1iq,t1_f9slwos,1575595010.0,Okay that makes more sense. Like I take 3 kpins a day and thought you were taking that much with your adderral.
schizophrenia,f9skmtg,t3_e6pk0f,1575594237.0,When you have another personality you loose your sense of self and become that identity. When you hear voices you still know who you are.

schizophrenia,f9sjua8,t3_e6q5xi,1575593854.0,Liver and kidney damage from long term use. Making your anti psychotics basically placebos from the alcohol. Plus it lowers your seizure threshold by a lot.

schizophrenia,f9sifdd,t3_e6pyr6,1575593046.0,"When I applied for disability I used a social security lawyer that only got paid if we won and he took it out of my winnings. They don't drag your doctor into your hearing. It's just you, your lawyer, and a judge. Your lawyer gets records from all your doctors and hospital visits and lays it out on the table what you would get if you won and your likelyhood of winning. Plus you get back pay from the date you applied to the date you start getting benefits.

And saying you're just paranoid or it's just your schizophrenia is very unprofessional to me. I'd look for new people if possible if I were you. Someone with a bit more compassion and understanding for the mentally ill."
schizophrenia,f9shpbc,t1_f9shjbb,1575592629.0,Isn't that kind of setting you up to fail at your job? Increased stress with a lack of mood stabilization.

schizophrenia,f9rte0f,t1_f9rroh3,1575581026.0,Wait and try going up and it should help. If you only want to take it once a day they make an extended release version of it too that peaks in 4 hours instead of an hour.
schizophrenia,f9rsvni,t1_f9rqvy9,1575580820.0,Just be truthful and if you feel like you're not being heard then find a different doctor. I've been schizo for 6 years and I just saw a doctor that told me I was just depressed and that triggered me to request to see someone else.
schizophrenia,f9rroij,t3_e4z3zu,1575580337.0,Who the hell gave you Adderral and Benzos? That could be potentially lethal. The symptoms you describe happen to me when I used to take Adderral. Also don't go off the antidepressants. They use them for long term anti anxiety too. Benzos are only supposed to be used for short periods of time.
schizophrenia,f9rpnn4,t1_f9rp8ce,1575579552.0,"Seroquel is a funny drug because it does different things at different dosages. It's half life is only 6 hours so you have to take it 2 or 3 times a day and it only starts working as an AP at around 200 or 300mg but can go up to around 1000mg if you're still having issues. Anything lower than that and it's basically a super antihistamine, it'll calm you down and make you drowsy but it won't help with symptoms. Hope this helps!"
schizophrenia,f9rp0ag,t3_e6n579,1575579303.0,People get hospitalized for depression and anxiety. You don't need to have been to the hospital to have any diagnosis. You're doctor will just give you a diagnosis as a label to help treat you anyway. It doesn't matter what that label is as long as your symptoms are being handled.
schizophrenia,f9rlrk7,t3_e4zs5g,1575578083.0,I have come to the realization that I will always be on meds and I'm okay with it.
