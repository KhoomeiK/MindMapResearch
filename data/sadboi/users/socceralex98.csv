I laugh at everything and want to make everyone around me laugh as well, even at my own expense. Although it's not necessarily a specific saying that I use, I've naturally used this to cope since I was a child, long before I was properly diagnosed. 

Also, I thought I liked to be alone for a long time until I realized that my comedy is perfect in a group. Now, when I'm with a bunch of people and 'on my game' so to speak, I'm the furthest away from depressed as I can be. 

Also, if you're in a similar mental position to my own, it obviously helps to be able to talk to someone, but don't think this means dwelling on your illness 24/7. I've found that not telling anyone outside of my family and doctor actually helped a lot. I can be aware of my own affliction and adjust without worrying what others think or being paranoid about being pitied. 

One last thing: nothing helped me more than finally finding the correct medication for me and getting an emotional support dog. Those two things helped me lose 65 lbs, motivated me to go back to school and make the Chancellor's list the first semester I returned, and honestly improve myself as a person in every possible way. The war will never truly be won, but believe me when I say that there is hope for the future and hope for happiness. Please don't give up. I'm glad that I didn't."
