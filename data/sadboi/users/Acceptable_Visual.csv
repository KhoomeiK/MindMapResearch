Go out of your comfort zone and do something you never have before! That‚Äôs a good way to cultivate intimacy with yourself.

BipolarReddit,fi61g49,t1_fi4cfj7,1582175972.0,I got my BS in neuroscience. Wanna read the paper ive written on lithium and human induced pluripotent stem cells? I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôve taken this as such a personal attack but what helps you doesn‚Äôt help everyone. And you have to accept that based off of how little is known about the brain. Just like there‚Äôs no hard lined scientific research to back up OPs claim there really isn‚Äôt any for yours either. That is there is nothing in the literature about positive benefits of LSD and lithium or lsd and bipolar. You‚Äôve drawn your own conclusions off of what you want to read. You can‚Äôt disprove OP  because you can‚Äôt prove your own theory with the information you have.
BipolarReddit,fi48lwd,t1_fi40k76,1582136161.0,"Your assertion that it poses no risk goes to show that you don‚Äôt understand science. You can‚Äôt say that something poses no risk when there‚Äôs as little known about lithium‚Äôs mechanism of action as there is.  That‚Äôs just not a conclusion you can draw from any of the papers you‚Äôve read. As lithium is a ubiquitous neuromodulator at the cellular level, the chances that there is an interaction with psychedelic drugs is a given. Again I‚Äôd like to reaffirm that RISK does not mean certainty. Just like how taking mdma on SSRIS doesn‚Äôt mean you WILL get serotonin syndrome, it just is a prevalent risk.  This person is doing a good job of informing others of risk based practice and you seem to have an obvious personal bias to this"

I think that is noble and enlightened, suffering is personal and immeasurable . but I‚Äôd also like to make the point that bipolar objectively can impair people‚Äôs lives- due to the difficulty in treating it/symptomatic severity/chance for comorbidity- more than unipolar depression. You can‚Äôt decide who suffers more, but it can be said that some mental illnesses can (on average) impact your daily living more than others.  And someone w just depression really can‚Äôt understand what we do, just like how i can‚Äôt really understand what it is like to be schizophrenic- that unique kind of suffering. I see  a point in what OP is saying for sure.
