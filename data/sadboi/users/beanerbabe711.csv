bipolar,fltwu94,t3_fqwpwl,1585489563.0,"I have bipolar l.. Your friend is incredibly lucky to have you. While I’ve never gotten close to that point, I felt myself slipping into rock bottom.. My parents and my ex didn’t understand my mental illness so I felt very trapped. I wanted to die. I felt like I couldn’t hold on for much longer. I remember waking up extremely hungover one morning. I looked at myself in the mirror and I couldn’t recognize who I had become. I sunk to the floor and cried so hard my ribs were sore the next day. I pounded the floor with my fists out of frustration. That’s when I told myself “no more”. I knew if I kept drinking hard and doing drugs id end up dead. That day I made a choice. 
It’s been over a year and a half since that day and I can’t believe how fast it’s gone by. I can’t believe how far I’ve come. 
Once you hit rock bottom you can either stay there forever or climb back up. I hope your friend gets the help she needs. 
You should be proud of yourself. Not all friends can sit through that and be there."

drugmemes,ff6862g,t3_ergolm,1579621408.0,I used to get awful anxiety from smoking bud.. I’ve been smoking for about 5+ years and one day I spark up the usual bowl and a few minutes later I feel far to overwhelmed. I experienced intrusive thoughts and my heart was beating so hard I couldn’t concentrate because I kept hearing it thump over and over again. I tried to do things around the house to get my mind off of it but it didn’t work. That’s when the panic slipped in. I had no idea what a panic attack was at the time. I was confused as to why I was having one.. I had quit for two years because every time I’d smoke it’d happen again. I was pretty down and sad because I couldn’t smoke but luckily things change and I’ve been smoking again with little to no anxiety. I’m so glad because weed helps me with physical pain and mental lol

For some odd reason I kept thinking and thinking about how MUCH I missed living there.. then BOOM, out of nowhere, I had a panic attack. It didn’t last long but I still found it weird. 
I honestly don’t know what causes your panic attacks, but what causes mine is trauma from years back that randomly pops up, too much sugar or caffeine or smoking too much weed at once."
