mentalhealth,f0qk59r,t3_d63i6q,1568861226.0,"This is my general existence... It makes me feel worthless.  I work a second job waiting tables bc I feel like I control the interaction to a larger degree. 

How could I ever reach out for help when nobody listens when i don't want to die."
mentalhealth,f04zj0p,t3_d2pygt,1568399262.0,Wow.... So needed this.  Like the rest of us I'm struggling...
bipolar2,exe90id,t1_exe5jve,1566204448.0,"Lithium has given me 6 hospital free years.  Like you I tried many antipsychotics that made me feel sicker than I was without meds.  It's tough to stay hydrated, my memory is terrible, conversations are harder bc I have trouble with words at times.  I stay pretty level, a wonderful regulator  but I don't feel as many emotions. 

Good luck"

bipolar,eskxlp9,t3_c853sn,1562075543.0,"Had a 2.5 year toxic relationship that should have ended after 2 months.  Don't know why I kept him around, struggling with my bad men choices and know I have to value myself more.... Right, is that even possible with self loathing?  
I'm a single mom and honestly don't think or care if ever have my sister's perfect fucking life.  Happiest when it's just the kids and me.... My son is leaving for school in August and I'm scared to death the affect it will have on me. 

All this to say, I'm right there with you."

bipolar,esj7aw8,t3_c82a0l,1562027409.0,"Aside from the hand tremors you described my life to a T.  I take 2 large bottles of water to bed and it's still not enough.  I don't sleep due to a sleeping-eating disorder and full bladder.  I can't wake up in the morning... Ever. 

The worst though is my mind.  I used to be able to speak with people and have a good conversation.  Now my words are gone and I feel like nothing idiot.  Reading is tough, I was an avid reader and puzzler.  The words jumble in my head and frustration, anger and sadness take over something I loved so much.  Tbh.. Im surprised I've written this much. 

I decided living this way is much better than being in the hospital."

bipolar,esh431f,t3_c7p6ig,1561981555.0,"I emailed my mom a medical breakdown and a ""day in the life of"" account of our illness from another middle aged woman's point of view.  It worked for a while... I've been pretty well for 6 years but continues to treat me like an idiot who's brain is incapable of a sound decision.  I get it for many years I couldn't. 
I'm sorry you have to deal with that on top of just maintaining."
