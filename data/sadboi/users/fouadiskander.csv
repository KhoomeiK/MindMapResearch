Egypt,eqk8m3b,t3_bypgcn,1560117837.0,"First off let’s all agree that a country is only as perfect as it’s people so when we look at Egypt all of its ministries are corrupt 

1 interior: intelligence officers use unspeakable means to attain intelligence 

2 exterior: attaining papers for leaving the country or todo business elsewhere is close to impossible without a bribe

3 education: schools are underfunded and teachers abuse students

4 energy: we buy our energy from Israel simply because we sell all our energy to other countries 

5 Tourism: vendors harass and assault tourists and bleed them dry for every penny they have

6 transportation: there are too many cars on the road and public transportation is unruly not fit for humans

Culture: music and art was once one of our main exports now our culture is condensed to singers like occa and Ortega and Mohammed Ramadan 

Honestly I am depressed by writing this but you get the bigger picture"
