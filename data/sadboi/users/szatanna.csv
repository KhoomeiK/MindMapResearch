She was so demanding, she was the type of professor to take points off for not solving problems EXACTLY her way and god forbid you didn't understand the material. She would not help you at all. Instead, she would just tell tell you to look it up on your own. I hated this professor with a fiery passion. I always left her class crying my eyes out.

socialanxiety,fp18hyb,t3_gajr6l,1588227460.0,"Mine stems from three things; my weight, genetics, and friends always leaving me. 

Genetics because my dad suffers from social anxiety and while his is not as severe as mine, I was unfortunate enough to inherit it. 

My weight is, I think, the main reason why I'm socially anxious. I've always been fat, since I was seven years old. I'm not morbidly obese, but still fat enough to keep me from going outside where people can see me. My body is something I can't hide or pretend I don't have, so the constant reminder that people can see how fat I am makes me extremely anxious. I know everyone thinks ""Oh, she's fat"" as the first thing that comes to mind whenever they see me. I fucking hate that. 

Also, since I was a child, I was never good at maintaining relationships with others. I used to have ""friends"" for short periods of time and things would be great until something happened to separate us. For example, when I was a kid I had three girls that I considered to be my best friends. Our parents were coworkers and friends, so we would go to each other's houses often. However, when my parents stopped being friends with their parents, they stopped talking to me. Things like that would happen often, I'd finally make friends, then bam, I had to change schools or move countries or people would stop talking to me. This made be unable to make friends as a teenager and adult. The last friend I had was in 2016 and it was this girl I really liked. I was even considering taking her to prom. But one day she just simply stopped talking to me. She said she couldn't hang out with me at school because she got a job at the school's library during lunch but I knew she lied because I always hung out at the library and never once saw her there. I never asked her what happened or what I did to make her leave, but that experience scarred me for life and gave one hell of a depression.  Since then, I pretty much became a misanthrope and haven't had any friends at all. I just gave up, which in turn has worsened my SA to the point where I don't know how to talk to people or even have a job."

At some point, you become desensitized to thing #1 and are able to move on. 

In the case of your fetishes (which by the way, it's totally normal to have fetishes) instead of completely forbidding yourself from watching that kind of porn, continue to watch it but everytime you do, do a very, very boring task or something like that to take your mind off the arousal.
