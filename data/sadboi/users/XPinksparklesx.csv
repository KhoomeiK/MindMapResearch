mentalhealth,fpkyxvi,t3_ge16b3,1588703455.0,I’m sorry you’re having a bad experience with that. It does sound like a chatbot. Are there any other online therapists out there? Maybe some have reviews or something you could check out. Idk but I’m hoping you find someone you connect with and can help.
selfharm,fp8gvhr,t1_fp8gng5,1588391972.0,I’m mostly relieved because I feel like it means he doesn’t judge me. And because I’m uncomfortable talking to him about it. I never want him to feel like it’s because of him.
mentalhealth,fp8ge7c,t3_gbgypq,1588391620.0,That’s awesome!!
Anxiety,fp3bs4k,t3_g9eu69,1588276560.0,I just can’t wait for all this shit to be over and be able to feel safe ish again.
Anxiety,fp3bmcb,t1_fot5rtn,1588276482.0,By substances do you mean no meds at all? I try not to self medicate but it’s just hard sometimes.
selfharm,fp3bfda,t1_fot776w,1588276386.0,I wish it were:/
Anxiety,fp3be5p,t1_fotca1p,1588276370.0,I can’t imagine this going on for two years. I’m so sorry.
selfharm,fp3b8uc,t1_fovcr08,1588276296.0,That’s how I feel because I screw/screwed up my life so much. Someone else could have done so much better than me.
selfharm,fp3b55x,t1_fovppkq,1588276246.0,Thank you for the insight. I’ll keep that in mind.
selfharm,fox02ew,t3_ga1id5,1588130896.0,I feel like some things are happening in my head too. It’s very strange and I hate it
mentalhealth,fot64c1,t3_g9b840,1588045501.0,"Always make her feel like you’re there for her. Try not to get angry with her over her mental health. I can imagine it’s sometimes really hard not to get mad, but try your best not to. Don’t forget to take care of yourself too. I’m sorry that’s all the help I’ve got. I hope she gets better."
Anxiety,fot5jrp,t3_g9eu69,1588045133.0,I feel the same way about taking Xanax. I’m so afraid I’ll get addicted or it will stop working if I take it too much.
Anxiety,fot5dsh,t3_g9aei1,1588045024.0,I honestly thought no one else had anxiety CONSTANTLY. I feel anxious for a variety of reasons every second of every day. I feel you. It sucks.
selfharm,fot4ojt,t3_g9bxkn,1588044575.0,Fuck whoever said that. I’m sorry someone did that to you.
selfharm,fot4gu2,t3_g9c3n2,1588044439.0,My right wrist. But I can’t cut there because I have to make all my cuts inconspicuous now that I’m married.
Anxiety,fot2nzn,t3_g9eu69,1588043289.0,"I know I’m extremely fortunate to be able to work from home, it just doesn’t feel like it although I want it to. I’m sorry you have to go through being anxious in people’s houses!!"
depression,fot28dm,t3_g99nut,1588043015.0,“As if we were all begging to be part of this world to begin with.” Exactly!
Anxiety,fot1xzp,t3_g9eu69,1588042838.0,Yes. Working from home is making my anxiety and depression worse for reasons I can’t even fathom.
selfharm,fot193v,t3_g9eoo0,1588042406.0,I’ll look that up. Thank you
selfharm,fot15jj,t3_g9axmx,1588042343.0,I definitely do it to punish myself and to release anger and sadness. I understand that so much.
mentalhealth,fe69ty3,t3_env9nw,1578884999.0,I always regret it but only because I know my husband will see it and it will make him feel bad. Which makes me feel worse and want to cut even more. A vicious circle.
selfharm,fe67yh8,t3_envrej,1578883782.0,Seeing the blood makes me feel good because it seems like I’ve hurt myself sufficiently. Punished myself enough. Without it it doesn’t feel like it’s enough.
selfharm,f11rw19,t3_d7e1bi,1569129704.0,Most likely they will tell her. They’re obligated to.
depression,f11r85s,t3_d7l1ec,1569129447.0,Sometimes it isn’t even dying. It’s just wanting life to be better. But it sucks so dying feels like the only way to make it stop. I feel you.
depression,f11q9om,t3_d7foof,1569129062.0,Yes. Like why does life hate me and I see other people living their dream lives and I’m just like why can’t that be me? That’s selfish I know.
selfharm,f11pekk,t3_d77opz,1569128693.0,I’m 31. I had been clean for probably 15years and fell back into it. It sucks.
Anxiety,f0gknys,t1_f0fc2lp,1568601293.0,I HATE when that happens.
