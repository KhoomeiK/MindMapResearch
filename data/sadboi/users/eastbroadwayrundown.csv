ptsd,ff82e64,t3_es4q18,1579664188.0,"It could be, for sure. I hope you're all right (considering) and came out of it without serious injuries.

In 2014 I was rear-ended on my bike at a stop  by a driver who 'just didn't see me.' Classic. I high-sided and was thrown about 30 feet. 

I had difficulty sleeping for weeks. I had nightmares about the accident regularly for, well, about a year.

I hope that you've checked in with a family doctor. Under the circumstances counselling would certainly be a good thing if you have access to it. 

Hang in!"

BipolarReddit,f901rpx,t1_f8xi843,1574967259.0,"I fourth! I graduated at 29, after 10 years, three schools, two cities, and many changes of program. 

I've also worked as university support staff for many years.  OP, I can't tell from your post if you have a disability accomodation, but your school \*should\* have that service and there's absolutely no shame in using it. You should also be able to petition on medical grounds to have failed courses turned into 'no grade' if that helps your transcript. 

Also, I think 'non-traditional' students rule. Older students have focus and experience that can be a great example to their classmates. (Of course I'm partial.) There is really no one 'right way' to do this. Hope that helps."

BipolarReddit,ewcfkcn,t1_ewc55py,1565283938.0,"I agree, this sounds like a normal experience.

50mg is a very low dose. I'm on 75mg right now. Previously diagnosed BPII, last diagnosis was major depression with anxiety. Doses for bipolar mania or schizoprenia are usually much higher, up to 800mg for people with schizophrenia IIRC. At 50-75mg I feel like it's just providing sedation at night and taking the edge off, and it definitely helps me sleep better. The only real side effect I have is night sweats, which are annoying but not the worst thing ever.

I've read a few articles about how Seroquel is overprescribed by doctors, for example for people with insomnia but no psych symptoms. In your partner's case, at a low dose, I don't think it's likely to do harm. Just make sure they keep following up with the docs and keep them aware of any symptoms or side effects."
bipolar,evkn5br,t1_evk1b01,1564583896.0,"Yes. I'm 45, first had a major depressive episode at 18 that lasted at least 3-4 months. Over the years the length of the depression has mostly, gradually shortened to days or even one day. Serious episodes have still knocked me out for a week or three, but they're not common.

Disclaimer: diagnosed BPII three times between 20-44, last diagnosis revised to major depression with anxiety. YMMV and good luck."

ptsd,evfq30s,t1_eveq3ez,1564499552.0,"There's good advice here. In terms of medical aid: your college should have an office of disability services. If you explain your situation, you should be able to get disability accommodations for your course work \*if\* you end up needing them - for example, you can get deadlines extended, or write your exams in a private room instead of a lecture hall. You may never need to use those options, but it's good to prepare them just in case you do. 

Source: moved out at 18 to escape my abusive family of origin, went straight into college, had a big meltdown, and dropped out of my first year. Later worked in university administration for 15 years. Congratulations on the full ride and good luck!"

What I meant by bingo - yeah, in my experience most of us don't fall neatly into the categories, and cross over different spectrums as well. When I was in college I was probably classic dual-diagnosis: substance use and mood disorder. Then again, that's also a lot of people who are never diagnosed lol."

ptsd,etlp0xh,t1_etlib3w,1562942062.0,"I'm on leave from a university job, where I was also a union steward for several years. I've attended regional and national conferences where other unions have reported that sexual violence and harassment is  \*the most\* pervasive problem affecting support and teaching staff. Unfortunately with very little protection or action from the institutions. You are absolutely not alone.

I'm thankful that I never worked on a sexual harassment case, because the record of the university \*and\* my own union protecting people from personal harassment or human rights harassment (racial, ageist) is terrible, and tbh one of the things that led me to a giant ass breakdown. Thanks for the link. I will read ... cautiously.

Sorry to derail, OP, and sorry that this has happened. Too often institutions that are supposed to protect us fail. Vent away."

bipolar,eslo68c,t3_c8b587,1562089011.0,"I was previously diagnosed with OCD in my 20s (I'm 45). I'm an abuse survivor and have lived with violent, intrusive thoughts for a long time. I also have some OC behaviours like hand washing, doing things in a certain order, stuff like that, but not enough to bug me. 

Anyway OCD is not one of my current diagnoses (which are BPII and depression). When I was diagnosed OCD, the idea of 'Harm OCD' didn't exist yet, though I think I fit the description. Personally I have really good interactions with my current pdocs and I've discussed intrusive thoughts with them openly. 

My antipsychotic (Seroquel) has really helped with the violent thoughts. Sometimes I get stuck on them anyway and I can usually bring myself down from there, though not always - at those times, I just keep to myself and ride it out. I am concerned that you say mood stabilizers or antipsychotics make your symptoms worse. Perhaps you need to tell your pdoc that.

I've been talking to the professionals long enough to have a full Diagnostic Bingo Card haha. Sometimes I've had really bad medical treatment, but lately I'm fortunate to have a good relationship with the docs. Can't really offer suggestions about how to bring this subject up, but I think it's worth doing because it's a real thing that's happening to you right now."
