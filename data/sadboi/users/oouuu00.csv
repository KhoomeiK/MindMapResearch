And I wanna tell you something, I romanticize and miss my vape as well. But, i see it this way: the vape is not the same anymore, it was my healthy"" beautiful pleasure that made me feel good. Now it's different no matter how beautiful rituals I put around it, it still send me to misery. Knowing it's harming my skin. 

So the thing is this, knowing it's not the same anymore. Yes it used to please you and make you happy because you thought it was healthy! Now when you knew otherwise, it stopped doing that. No matter how hard you try to confirm to it.
