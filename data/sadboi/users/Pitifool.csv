If I make myself get lost in the work and chug along without worrying about how well I should be doing, then maybe I'll get a little further than I would otherwise.

I find it impossible to believe that the universe can be anything but deterministic. Every little thing humans or animals do is just a product of the billions of conditions of that moment in time. I do believe that (if we make it that far) we will eventually pretty much have human behavior down as an exact science and have the tools to pinpoint exactly what contributed to each of our decisions, and even to predict exactly how an individual will behave at a given moment in time (with the possible exception of the interference caused by making the prediction). All of our notions of intuition and trusting our gut or emotions are just placeholders for our lack of understanding of certain finer details. Intuition is only necessary because we don't have complete information - once we do, it will be obsolete. And the ""magic"" of life will be gone."

It does help a little bit, but it falls apart and isn't nearly enough if you still don't really have friends or a social group. For one, there would frequently be times where I would get kind of sick of her, just because we would pretty much always be together one-on-one. No groups to hang out with, no social places to go. It was still very isolating, just with a couple instead of an individual. She also had a decent social life outside of me, which made me feel like a dog or something. She was like 90% of my entire social world, but she had this whole world outside of me. Really felt inferior. And still I didn't really have the energy to give her the attention and support she needed. So used to being alone that it's hard to suddenly have this one person you have to prioritize higher than you've ever prioritized anyone before.

So yeah, it probably helps, but you need to step up and balance it with other relationships and a generally healthier lifestyle too. It's a piece of the puzzle but if you take it without the other pieces, you're in for failure and frustration."

AskReddit,fex4qbd,t1_fex0itj,1579424318.0,"Okay, yeah I see what you mean. But (and I may be wrong), when it comes to time dilation, isn't it mathematically valid to use ""normal"" time as the frame of reference when explaining this phenomenon, as well as to use the skewed model of time? 

If a system is experiencing 2 seconds per second, is that any different than saying that everything in that system is progressing at twice the speed as usual, and that time hasn't been affected? So if there's a system where a ball is rolling 1 m/s, and that system is moving -1 s/s, is that physically any different than just having a ball roll -1 m/s? 

Expanding - if a human being is travelling back in time at -1 s/s right in front of me, isn't he also moving forward in my time? The only difference is that for each one of my seconds, my brain is operating normally, but his brain (and body) is operating backwards."
AskReddit,fewzt8m,t1_fewy4lr,1579422023.0,"Yeah, I'm not arguing against that. We agree, when you're calculating these things it's just a matter of a signing convention. But what I got from your initial comment was that you were exploring the idea of time really, physically flowing backwards. Which I don't think means anything. If I move forward 1 m/s, that is the same as me moving -1m/-1s. Flowing backwards in time that way isn't only possible - I'm actually doing it. It's just that our perception of time is dependent on our experience, and my experience is dependent on my memory, and my memory can only store information from one direction. So while I perceive myself moving forward in time, there is literally no physical difference from me moving backward in time. I don't think the idea of moving through time has any physical bearing. It's just a convention."

So even if it was a cry for help and you pushed it a bit too far, you're fucked now.

I take it you're probably super lonely and devoid of human contact too? Navigating human relationships can be really tough, you can easily send the wrong signals (like innocent mistakes) and get shunned for it.

Pets are really nice because all you have to do is take care of them and they'll love you to some capacity. A lot harder to screw up.
I hope you can get a new pet sometime in the near future, once you feel a little better.

I've very rarely ever actually been told I'm retarded, but that's because I always try to keep my mouth shut enough to make people think I'm either actually smart or aware of how witless I truly am. Though every now and again I've gotten those ""you have got to be kidding me"" looks which didn't register with me until later.

But I'm with you on being ""school smart"" and not ""street smart."" I've always gotten good grades but I know that doesn't count for anything. I can only hit things within a reasonable margin when I have oceans of time to sit and essentially retrace other people's steps. I can rarely come up with things by myself and I certainly can't think on my feet, which is what it's all about. Stupid reddit posts and comments like these take me 15 minutes to an hour to compose. 

And as to managing to ""fuck up at mopping a floor"" - as a kid I literally felt too incompetent to do simple cleaning tasks. They felt too overwhelming. I distinctly remember once my dad paid me to sweep up his shop and when I was done, he was visibly embarrassed by how poorly of a job I was able to do, when I tried my best. He rationalized it by saying ""when I was young, I thought sweeping and cleaning was beneath me too,"" but I legitimately just wasn't good at such a simple task as sweeping a floor."

When I'm in a situation at work where I feel completely useless and small I talk very curtly and dismissively until I can sneak away to pull my hair out or something."
memes,fb3lp1u,t3_eb6yeb,1576477660.0,When I was a kid this used to upset me and I'd think to myself how it would be so much easier in real life. Then I considered how many bullets real me could take and I conceded to the game.
