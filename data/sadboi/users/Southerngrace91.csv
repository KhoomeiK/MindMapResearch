Although they will tell you they are not a denomination, that simply isn‚Äôt true. The definition of denomination within itself disproves that. Although Stone and Campbell were right to try and restore the NT church, how can we sure that the Church of Christ resembles that as closely as they claim? We simply cannot know. Take instruments for example, they created a doctrine against it, claiming instruments weren‚Äôt around in the NT church. How would we know if the C of C only goes back to the restoration era? I am not bashing people who attend the church of Christ because many are wonderful people. They just believe what they have been taught."

I do believe practicing homosexuality is a sin but I believe if Christians aren‚Äôt careful, they can put more shame on this sin than others. I know Christians who struggle with same sex attraction but do not act on it. Someone who struggles with homosexuality is no worse than a straight man or woman struggling with fornication. I do not believe anyone chooses which sins they struggle with and that is where we need to have empathy which each other <3 God bless!"
