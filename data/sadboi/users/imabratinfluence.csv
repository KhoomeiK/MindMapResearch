- **Cattail Apothecary** Tattoo Balm which has been stellar for healing up eczema outbreaks, and either Aurora Oil or Marshmallow Hibiscus Oil (Aurora is a touch heavier than MH, so it depends on how my skin feels). 

- **Paintbox Soapworks** mini glycerin soaps. I rotate them with my boring mainstream soap bars, and these seriously make my day better. They smell amazing, they're pretty, they don't provoke my eczema as much as some mainstream soaps, and they just kinda remind me to take a moment and *breathe* every time I wash my hands. 

- **Fyrinnae Molten Gloss**. It feels nice, doesn't dry out my lips, has pretty decent staying power for a gloss, and every time I see it it makes me happy. If I wear no other makeup, I'm probably still wearing this gloss.

- **Area of Effect - Combustible Lemons** just helps me feel more cheery in the midst of all this weirdness and uncertainty. And the smoky/leathery aspect of it is comforting to me."

A lot of people will likely suggest vanilla, lavender, super sweet scents, gourmand stuff, and rice notes. Personally, I find that lavender often triggers my asthma (as do patchouli and sandalwood sometimes), and I'm not into vanilla, sweet, or gourmand scents. 

My favorite calming scents are Alkemia's Book of Shadows (old leather books and metallic inky scent), smokey scents like Future Primitive Pyewacket and Area of Effect Combustible Lemons, leathery-woodsy scents like LuvMilk Four of Diamonds and Fyrinnae Paw Prints, and green scents like Little and Grim Poor Farm and Darling Clandestine Vardogr. Scents with a little jasmine and amber sometimes do it for me too, like Alkemia's Vixen.

Some waxes I love and find calming are Paintbox Soapworks Buffalo Plaid (my partner finds their Rice Pudding wax calming), Willow Waxcraft's 7 Days and Stud. 

For bath/shower stuff, Paintbox Soapworks Demeter Forsaken and Dead Leaves on the Dirty Ground are calming to me. So are Cocoa Pink's Cowboy From Hell, Padre, Autumn Splendor, and Frost Byte."

This is a dewy almost wet, fresh rose. The fir is definitely there but sort of melds with the incense rather than drowning out the other notes.

For makeup I'm going to attempt using Fyrinnae Lava in the Ocean as liner, because I feel like that would do Molly proud. 

I suppose in the spirit of staying on theme I should recommend [Critical Role](https://critrole.com/qtvideo/campaign-2/). If you already watch CR and you're all caught up and bummed that they're not currently shooting new episodes, I'd also suggest [Dimension 20](https://youtu.be/_zZxCVBi7-k)."

A mask full of my face oil in the heat here feels really gross really quickly. 

Other than that, I'm considering a small soap order from Paintbox Soapworks (I'm rotating my scented soaps with Ivory and Dial my MIL gave us-- I'm allergic to Ivory, Dial, and Irish Spring, but it's a fairly slow reaction so if I rotate I can kinda get away with using it up). 

There are plenty of things on my wishlist, but for now I'm trying to be practical. I'm high-risk and may have to go back to work soon.

vs 

**Deconstructing Eden - Gymnopedie**: *Cold stone, raindrops, fog, and pale amber lights.* 

A stone note is about all these two have in common. Gymnopedie smells almost a bit gingery at first and then settles down to a slightly more interesting iteration of the Alkemia Ghost Fire/NAVA Eternal Ankh type situation. Gymnopedie smells pretty clean, despite smelling very simple syrup-y and there is something that gives it an air of coolness (probably the fog accord).

E Lucevan Le Stelle goes on very sort of dirty, indolic white floral with some noticeable stony/earthy notes coming up quickly as it settles. Not sweet, definitely sultry and almost a bit humid.

Indiemakeupandmore,fq7qam8,t3_gh26yt,1589150037.0,"- **Conditioner.** I'm mostly using **Future Primitive Hair Conditioning Rinse** now, but I also like **LuvMilk Conditioner**.

- **Sugar Scrub.** My favorites are **Paintbox Soapworks Sorbetto** and LuvMilk Sugar Scrub (the LuvMilk one is discontinued). Since LuvMilk's is so oily I love it when my eczema-prone skin is feeling dry and itchy. If I'm feeling really grimy I tend to reach for PBSW's scrub, because it's thicker and a little bit soapy (which can be overly drying for me if I'm already feeling dry).

- **Moisturizer**. **Cocoa Pink Shower Butter** is my heavy-hitter (winter seasonal, so it'll be a while before it's offered again). When I'm super dried out, this stuff is my saving grace. [There's no water in it as recommended by the NEA](https://nationaleczema.org/eczema/treatment/moisturizing/), and it's super thick and can be a pain to apply but nothing kills the itchy dryness like the shower butter does. For lighter moisture I tend to like their Voluptuous Butter or their body oils (they have a dry body oil and some Silky Soft formulas that are more moisturizing). 

- **Lip Balm**. My favorite right now is Epically Epic. Long Winter Farm has a nice formula too.

- **Lip Color**. My current favorites are Fyrinnae's Molten Gloss and Sihaya & Co's tinted balms.

- **Stratia Rewind**. It's been a godsend for my skin. [Before Rewind](https://imgur.com/mYJBLfx) came into my life. [After adding Rewind](https://imgur.com/a/6ghdlYf).

- **Cattail Apothecary Aurora Oil**. My skin gets along with this better than Stratia's Liquid Gold, and it actually helps prevent my eczema from flaring up on my face (except during my period).

- **LuvMilk Dusting Powder**. I like this as dry shampoo, and for helping with boob sweat. I typically don't use lotion the same places I put dusting powder, so order of operation is typically a non-issue for me.

- **Hair Oil**. Currently my favorites are Libertine Bath Haus Hair Glace and Solstice Scents Burnishing Glace used as a light hair oil. Sixteen92 Sea Salt Spray does have some oil in it as well, and I like it when my hair needs some help with its texture.

- **Face Powder**. As a very oily-faced person, a little powder helps a lot. My two favorites are DreamWorld Cosmetics Cloud formula foundation and Fyrinnae Oil Control Finishing Powder depending on whether I feel like I have redness to cover. I have Fyrinnae's Powder Primer on the way to try since mask-wearing is likely to make colorless powder more practical than foundation for a while."

[The Collective Cosmetics](https://thecollectivecosmetics.com/pages/the-collective-cosmetics-faqs) likewise doesn't have a specifically goth look, but you can choose the shades you want in order to create the kind of look you want.

You might also check out [Fairypants](https://www.etsy.com/shop/Fairypants). It might be more cutesy-goth than you're looking for in an [Amy Brown fairies](https://amybrownart.com/) kind of way, but I wasn't finding much that fits the specific niche you're looking for!"

This took a long time to settle and become something other than tooth-achingly sweet vanilla confection. There's a creamy element and something floral here now, and distinctly a cocoa butter scent-- bear in mind most white chocolate you find doesn't have cocoa butter or any other real chocolate elements in it because it makes the ""white"" chocolate take on a yellowy look that makes people think it's gone rancid. Still too gourmand-leaning for me. Not my jam, but I'll use it up. 

**Cocoa Pink - Apocalypse**: *Dark empty musk infected with lashes of black vanilla, petitgrain essential oil, magnolia flowers, jasmine sambac with the empty remains of vanilla sandalwood.* 

I have this in the linen spray. I vastly prefer this one-- it has a little more woodiness, and the petitgrain gives a lot of scents a little something that I really enjoy. The florals aren't overwhelming, and I think they help contribute to this not turning into Coty Vanilla Musk on me. I'd also like to note this is the scent where Cocoa Pink was kind enough to do a custom label for me, leaving off the Z-word due to my kinemortophobia.

I'm usually not big on vanilla but endometriosis is kicking my ass today and my hormones have dictated that one week out of the month is vanillas, ambers, and resins time. And Apocalypse is the clear victor here."

Also wore **Fyrinnae - Wicklow Wildflowers**: *Various blooms such as wild orchids, thyme, and clover, easily found among fields of greenery throughout spring.*

This doesn't enter cleaning product or lemon dessert territory on me. It's sliiightly sweet fresh lemon and sort of a just-burned-out candle smell. The sage and leather are there as supporting notes.

Woodsy, a hint sweet, really does smell like it's glowing, and I can smell a bit of the bergamot cutting through. I'm not really picking up the lavender, nor is it setting off my asthma like it sometimes does.

From them, I tested samples of: 

- **Cozy Cashmere Comforter**: *A soft blend of spicy, ambery, woodsy cashmeran, sweet caramel and creamy vanilla sugar.*

This one struck me as very much being in the same kind of category as Alkemia Ghost Fire, NAVA Eternal Ankh, Hexennacht Loup-Garou and Le Chat Noir. My partner says this one smells very sweet, but also *smells* like the texture of cotton candy. 

- **Eidolon**: *ghost-flower, golden amber, prickly pear & desert sand.* 

This is like a less-sweet, somewhat more atmospheric version of Cozy Cashmere Comforter. I'm not sure what else to think of this one just yet, but I definitely prefer it since it's less sweet. 

- **Whip'd Créme Body Wash in Subzero** I couldn't find the full notes for this one: *a clean, woodsy and uplifting blending of lime zest, wintry-evergreen notes of grand fir needle, silver fir absolute, pine, olibanum, black spruce,* 

It took me a while to realize what this smells like to me. After some deliberation, I think it smells like the neon green Otter Pops. Although the big chalky tart-sweet ball-shaped candies from the quarter machines are a fairly close match too. My partner says it smells like key lime pie. I was hoping for more woodsy, atmospheric notes, but no. This is dessert. 

The soap formula is a little bit of a strange texture, but I'm not opposed. Texturally it reminds me a bit of either pudding, or flax seed gel + conditioner as DIY hair cream. It's easy to scoop and spread, and left me feeling clean. I did get it with sugar, and it's sparse and evenly distributed-- there isn't a ton of sugar in this, and it wasn't floated on top needing to be mixed in.

Also wore **Area of Effect - Twilight Princess**: *violet, bergamot, vanilla, orchid, cardamom, brown sugar, grass, teakwood, coffee.*
