But it does get better. When you get proper treatment, your life improves significantly. Then you learn that you don't have to live your life impressing people. Just focus on *your* goals and do what *you* want to do with your career and education. If your classmates don't like it, they can get out of your life

I think that cartoons take an amazing amount of creativity to make. Most cartoons have a ton of real world elements in them (scenery, buildings, animals) that take a lot of skill to translate to cartoon form.

As far as inferiority goes, people make cartoon out to be easy, but its really not. You have to follow the principles of art as well as your own rules that you made for your world. 

However, copying cartoon drawings and styles is easy. I personally find drawing existing cartoon and anime characters boring and unfulfilling as much as I love watching and reading about them.  I don't look down on people who draw them, but I find much more fulfillment in creating my own cartoons or painting landscapes"
