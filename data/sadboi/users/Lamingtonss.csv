I work at a GP clinic and let me tell you they do not just hand out prescriptions for stuff like that. What  likely happened is her normal doctor refused the script because she should still have medication left as per her prescription if not she requires a review from the  doctor if the pain really has gotten worse to justify writing her a new script - even then with certain medications the doctors can get in ALOT of  trouble and possibly loose their medical license if they just straight up ignore the  rules regarding those drugs. They are screwed if they are audited and they've just been handing out opiods etc.

She probably went to another  doctor somewhere else and lied to get a new script. Its not uncommon and weve had people run out of doctors rooms when they've called the dr shopper line.
