I would always imagine a secret camera behind my classroom as we face our teacher and my mother watching me frantically for any delinquent behavior."
lonely,f326q7z,t1_f321rml,1570595452.0,"This is how I met people was by joining clubs. 

Though to be honest though, no matter how many people I surround myself with, I still feel very lonely and alone. But on another note, without them, I would have thought of myself as being unworthy of company and probably be to an extent, a worst cuckoo than I already am.

To OP, sometimes seeking out professional help be it in the form of a doctor is just for the sake of keeping a scrap of your own sanity, not a declaration of defeat, so don't be afraid to do it!"
insomnia,f31qq2u,t1_f31pj1k,1570582260.0,"I used to have these nightmares a few years ago. I had existential issues and would fear my own mortality. Eventually, this extended to dreams of death in my family or my own. They felt so real that I would wake up feeling so sad until it hits me it was a dream and then delighted I glow. 

Is this something new you are experiencing or has it been for quite some time now?"

lonely,f1rbu1s,t3_dakncf,1569713689.0,"Same here. I cannot help who I feel ""cozy"" towards, but what I can help is what I do about it- generally it has been to ignore the feeling the best I can. I wouldn't mind expressing it to them, but I would hate to drag someone into my cloudy world of thunder and uncertainty.
