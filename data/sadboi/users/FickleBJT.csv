The actual problem was that they weren't recording gender and comparing the results between men and women (they weren't checking their data/results for bias)

Women, on average, make many smaller purchases (cosmetics, food for the family, household essentials, etc) while men tend to make less frequent but large purchases (think TVs, cars, technology, etc). The algorithm gave higher credit scores to people making large purchases, even if the same amount of money was spent in total.

That is a gender bias due to the structure of our society, but the algorithm did not account for it. Having a lower credit limit would then, of course, amplify this biased outcome further.

DNA samples are also destroyed if ""a criminal action begun against the individual... does not result in a conviction,... the conviction is finally reversed or vacated and no new trial is permitted ""or ""the individual is granted an unconditional pardon.""""

Immigrants are not being arrested, they are not currently suspected (with probable cause) of committing a crime (let alone a serious one), and they are not being charged with a crime.

EDIT: I see you ninja'd in a new question. If I've been arrested for a suspected DUI, then probable cause has been fulfilled. The officer has cause to believe I broke the law because I'm acting intoxicated after he pulled me over (and probable cause would be needed to pull me over in the first place).

The officer could not, however, pull me over, take my DNA, and then say ""you're free to go"".

In addition, if I was taken in and my DNA sampled, they would have to destroy the DNA sample if they dropped the charges or if I don't get convicted.
