But historically speaking it's still the best, shitty system of government we ever thought of. For better or for worse, democracy means that if 50%+1 people want to leave a supranational union, you have to honour that. Otherwise Britain stops being part of the free world.

Iceland isn't in the EU, Switzerland isn't in the EU, Norway isn't in the EU. And they are all in the top 10 quality of life. Not saying it's gonna be easy to achieve that, just saying that it isn't the end of the world. And it also doesn't mean that you must be in a bad relationship with the EU if you're not part of it officially. It's gonna be fine. Britain went through worse and always came out well at the end."
europe,eoo1kxl,t1_eoncrua,1558726907.0,"Fair points. Yet still doesn't explain why we should be the ones feelings guilty about it since we (the West) are doing more about climate change than the rest of the world combined. This is like feeling guilty about throwing a plastic straw while the neighbour has been throwing his trash in the pond nearby the house for the last 30 years. Stop it. Call out the real polluters. Stop feeling sorry for yourselves. This isn't helping.

I happen to live in Ecuador as a car electornics repair guy, you should see the kind of diesel trucks coming here. The kind that are illegal to still drive in Europe for 2 decades, lol. Really, stop being little bitches, you're not responsible for climate change anymore.  The best thing you can do is protest 3rd world countries not implementing what we've implemented decades ago. They can't protest. We can. Let's protest who is really deserving of criticism. Not beat ourselves up for what others are doing. That's not gonna help fight climate change. The real criminals are still doing it."
europe,eon2pvp,t3_bsdwuj,1558702688.0,"Don't they live in one of the greenest industrialised countries? I mean China's out there producing like one third of the world's pollution and Germans feel guilty and responsible? Where are the Chinese students protesting or even acknowledging climate change? What's the point of this? We all acknowledge and fight at an institutional level climate change in Europe. You have to pay a shit load of taxes to buy an older car.

We did our part long ago. Protest the real polluters and stop feeling sorry for yourself after you've already became one of the greenest industrialised countries. This is ridiculous."
