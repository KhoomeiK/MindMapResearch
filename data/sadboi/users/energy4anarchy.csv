I've known a few like this and their just naturally spontaneous, energetic people! I've  heard nothing but good things about Fallon and his body language comes off as quite genuine... after all, he's trying to make conversations (often between semi-strangers) entertaining and illuminating.

Say in other instances - Carpool Karaoke... you know you're almost watching a skit, so it can be as heightened as they want it as its a sort of gimmick.

There are all these memes/quotes about travelling the world, almost mindlessly with some inherent beaty and so on and so on... but for me, quarantine has kind of changed that.

Of course I want to see the world - but the world has sort of become a less interesting place in some weird way for me. We all burrow straight into our houses when shit like this happens... humans are unpredictable, unreliable... selfish and so on.

I don't want to rain on your parade - I wish you luck for the future... and your life is much different to mine! But for me, I don't know, whilst travel is wonderful and I've enjoyed it immensly,  its kind of also reminded me how impersonal it is...

&#x200B;

Wouldn't mind some advice on this actually?

&#x200B;

I think in a way - many of us here are entrepreneurial, even if on a smaller scale - managing funds, savings, investments etc... its all a mesh of similarities we all perhaps share that want to strive for independence.

&#x200B;

I'm 38... I could have FIRE'd a few years ago... but that would have been just your standard sort of  life with no bells and whistles. Nothing, nothing at all wrong for that, don't get me wrong... but just a house in the burbs, daily driver car (nothing fancy) and well, life all wrapped up with X in the bank and X earnings per year.

&#x200B;

Done....

&#x200B;

But only until recently (I now have a 7 year old and a 5 year) old... but back then when I did NOT have kids... I didn't FIRE because I kept stoking the fire to have more and more... pushing the goal posts further and further as I arrived at each.

&#x200B;

And I'm glad I had that drive to be honest... because now, where I am with loss of motivation to just keep going - in a way I paved this path without knowing... so its made life easier.

&#x200B;

I've been interested in property for a while - building/developing blah blah... and funnily enough, last year we settled and took possession of our house/build that is really a dream for my wife and I...

&#x200B;

But... I fell into some sort of depression or something, because in a way, everything lined up and I got what I wanted.

&#x200B;

Its funny -  the saying... be careful for what you wish for... you just might get it.

&#x200B;

I think really for me now, life isn't even really about money!  I've made heaps and in some stupid mentality - I'd give it all up to start again...

AusFinance,fqgo6gt,t1_fqgmwin,1589351795.0,"Hey Man... I don't want to patronize you or pep talk you, but just really remind you that the world is yours for the taking if you want it to be!

And here is why:

Look, I'm 38 and its very unlikely (unless I really, really, really have some luck and either fall into money, inherit money or build a business/enterprise that will scale to large money)... that I, like you... will have that massive Mansion with helipad 5kms from the CBD that adjoins a river/ocean.

But some will... and lucky them... Capitalism and the society we know and love (and Hate) has given these guys the opportunity for that. Perhaps its generational - perhaps sheer luck - perhaps hard work... perhaps a combination of all.

But just remember that 95% of the rest of the world... over 7 billion people like you and I trying for that same dream... and if you shift what that dream is, you can have anything.

Yes, there are people literally begging for food, dodging bullets, working 17 hour days for pennies... there is literally countless amount of people out there that you should take some reflection on that have it worse than you.

We don't cheer for them to have it worse - but they do... and in reflection it can help you realize that investments are just investments in the grand scale of things.

There is no point turning over why you didn't buy Bitcoin when it was 1c... or why you missed a house in the 80's when it was much cheaper... because in a way, that is done and new opportunity awaits you.

Just because things were different then - doesn't mean it was better... and rememember, our brains look back to the past with fondness because we survived, because it was all OK and we didn't die... and we look to the future with trepidation/anxiety because we don't know what that holds for us.

This means we look back at earlier generations and go ""Oh but they had it good and my future, well I don't know what my future is, so I'm anxious"".

And this my friend has been going on since the dawn of man... literally every generation after every generation...

I'm not saying you don't have the right to be anxious. We all do - its a trying time and I'll admit the past 50-60 years (i'm 38) and since the industrial revolution, the mining booms, Capatalism, internet and so on - life has really changed.

We're a global village now - people in India will be interested in YOUR backyard... and in fairness, you could be the same with them.

But Australia really is a great, wonderful country and like all the generations before - the one thing that most people had in common is that they did in fact work hard for what they have.

For some - that meant a house 5kms from the CBD and others a house 50kms from the CBD... for some $5k in the bank and for others $5million

It sucks that there is disparity - but there is and take safety in the knowledge in knowing that you can always look over the fence and the grass is greener if you let it.

But i have every bit of faith, absoltuely every bit... that if you work hard, save hard, live life... that you'll reach your goals. They may not be my goals... but they'll be yours"

AusFinance,fqgls9b,t1_fqgig9f,1589349758.0,"It is really biased... and that's fine too.

I'm 38, so almost a senior here or at least up there with the older crews.

And of course - house prices have raised significantly in Australia, as they have in other countries... and for a number of reasons, but mostly, its a wonderful country.

Why do you think droves of Chinese and now Indians (The new Chinese) are flocking here in droves. Sure - make a buck or two... but the quality of life, culture, space, you name it... everything we take for granted... literally up for sale and ready to go!

People will always compare things to indexed prices from 40 years ago... but the world is just changing so much that often those numbers are pointless. I love that a 5bdr home 10kms out of the major capital city was only $100k back then and now, 40 years later its $3m... but the way of life was so different back then in so many unimaginable ways the young ones can't fathom.

I sound like such an old fart - but there are so many socio-economical changes that influence these things that no matter how many charts/bar graphs and so on can forecast.

I'm from Melbourne so I wish people didn't have to live in Pakenham for a house out that way... but its a good suburb, flows into the city via freeway and train line and you can buy there for under $400k and easily, easily raise a family with great schools, great health and safety... compared to say, Mexico? Brazil, Dehli? and so on... 

And yes - wage gaps and all the rest - but families have changed. Now we're double income and no kids...  you can be a 22 year old, finishing a degree and walking into a job paying $80k... team that with a partner doing the same and you're on $160k a year... if not even more.

I know tradies working in the suburb, unskilled, blokes pushing wheelbarrows all day, earning $40 bucks an hour cash subbying to some landscaper and so on.

Anyway this could go on and on and i get its all relative... but it aint that bad! It really isn't... (well not now, now is bad)... but there is opportunity if you work for it!"
AusFinance,fqgl5td,t1_fqgkccx,1589349248.0,"Yes but shares and property are also much different of an investment vehicle and its so difficult to honestly compare the two because one is a bricks and mortor, physical investment  its amount is relatively finite once the price is settled on (except for increase/decrease on prices from the market).

I can't release more bricks from my house as I can for you to buy them... so unfortuantly, you buy 1 brick you buy them all - and that is $500k give or take where you're buying for example.

Share's fluctuate in volume so they can be bought/sold in this fashion and are accessible to everyone... but what if shares cost $100k each or $500k each and were designed NOT to be so sporadic and so on.

I get the frustrating - but buying $20k of shares and $20k of a house is different, because a house cannot be released in the same way shares can and because its not as accessible, doesn't really make it any different to trading any other commodity.

A perfect example is BitCoin... and look at the sheer grubbiness panic buying/selling/theft etc occuring with that... when that had its gold rush.

Meh - anyway - you get all this... but I'm not convinced they've (young) but completely priced out

https://www.realestate.com.au/buy/property-house-in-pakenham/list-1?activeSort=price-asc&source=refinement

AusFinance,fqghv4x,t1_fqgfzb6,1589346680.0,"Look man - I was just teasing!

And I fully agree... and in a way I think I'm going to be set up for disappointment when (if) all this (Covid) blows over because my gut feel, from what I'm seeing/judging from a social perspective is, nothing is going to change.

People are literally frothing to get back to the way things were... which was capitalistic, survival of the fittest... and constant use of finite resource to get ahead of your neighbour

And it fucking sucks.... and personally, I'm so tired of it.. and I've done incredibly well

I'd love to see collectively Australia (or in fact the World) shift our interest from having the most Instagram Followers or the most face tatts and biggest bank accounts.... to actually leading the way in science, innovation and entrepreneurship... but, well, we won't!


Covid will come and go and we'll literally go back to climbing on top of each other.

But the reason why I commented about property is because people will go crazy here talking about ETF's and/or the stock market and profiting from it... yet shoot down anyone talking about House Prices or other commodities....

As if investing in Housing is a cunt thing to do - but the greediness, wolf of wall st type guzzling from the corporate greed is perfectly fine.

And  look, parts again I agree... House pricing should be affordable and to a degree, well it is. I mean, I'm from Melbourne and I've love for my family to have a 5 bedroom home 6kms from the city... but its supply and demand and land is finite. Those that can afford it have it.... and whilst I can pay $3m for that , I can still actually pay 1/4 of that and be 50kms out from the city.

The house may in fact be bigger, newer, nicer even... its just not 6kms from the city. 

The truth is there is loads and loads and loads of affordable housing in the suburbs and outer reaches... and Melbourne/Syd and others are popular places to live and people gambled on prices going up - just like they did any other thing.

It sucks - but again, supply demand/finite land as a resource and this is what happens.

But people here applaud shorting stocks that are from companies that a literally laying off thousands of workers, or don't pay tax or minimal tax in the countries they operate... literally screw their employees and so on... but that's perfectly fine.

Simple - hey I bought an investment property... oh well fuck you man... oh  hey, I just made 15% on BHP and CEL Mining stocks raping the earth ""oh cool, what's your strategy"".

Reaching out here indicates to me that this may have hit you harder than some. Not saying that its easy - but for some, grief is easier for some than what it is others.

But what I really wanted to say is - take the time to see a therapist or talk it out. Your BF will be great support (I imagine), as will friends and family... but if this grief is really overwhelmingly, and rightly so... I suggest seeing someone to talk to, let it all out with.

I lost my father back in 2016... so a while back now and whilst we knew is was coming (cancer) - it really did have an effect on me, something that I actually think has created a longer lasting anxiety.

In a way, for me, dare I say it was Traumatic... which feels a little over the top but we all deal with things differently. But for me, this trauma kind of kicked on, because I didn't address it... and whilst I don't deal with trauma... I do have this lingering anxiety that hasn't been the greatest/helpful.

But ... and a BIG BUT... the good news is that like anything, mental health is treatable... and honestly, you can work through these things with the right people.

If you get a chance, try and see someone... and in the short term, need to vent or talk to someone, PM me and I'd be happy to talk.

fiaustralia,fpubpi7,t1_fpubbi1,1588909064.0," But you’ve lived the Australian dream? You’ve got an education, you’ve had your health taken care of, you’ve gotten a good job and you’ve been able to purchase a house! You’ve literally followed every step along the way to the Australian Dream and are now saying, “meh, what’s it good for...” when it’s supported you literally every step so far?

Those people living the South American jungles you’re desperate to visit would literally kill for your position...

All good man"
fiaustralia,fpu9a5a,t1_fpu8ugd,1588907483.0,"All good man... as I said, I wouldn't have commented if you paraphrased it diffirently... but its the internet, so who gives a shit.

I just thought it came off a bit smug... because in a way, you've kind of said ""Achievement Unlocked - Australian Dream""... and mention how you worked hard to pay it off and then, well, it's shit.

Some people will be literally trying to do what you're doing.

Meh - oh well"

fiaustralia,fpu3zwm,t3_gfi1ga,1588904173.0,"So things I take from this (and I know you're not flexing - but we need to get some perspective here as well)

1) Inherit an amount that contributes to 15% to your mortgage (easy enough I guess)


2) Be in the top 1% income bracket and make in excess of $100k take home a year


3) Live off $28 dollars a day


4) and then.... Rub shit on the ""Australian Dream"".


Look man - good for you. Good for you that you set your goals and achieved them... that's great!


But this all sounds pretty shit to me... 

Living on $28 bucks a day to go live in the Jungles of South America with no kids/family isn't my dream... and fair enough its not yours... but no need to rub my nose in it.


Other than that - good luck man."

I have two children under 7, if i was riding this solo in my current position I honestly couldn’t give a shit... you could lock me down for 6 months and I wouldn’t care.

But some of us have vested interests beyond ourselves and for me it’s for two school aged children

Not gate keeping here, but some of us getting pulled left right and centre"
melbourne,fpr5yrg,t1_fpr4btf,1588843615.0,"Look I agree... but even your comment “accept the fact... it’s unpredictable” ... doesn’t follow the one, national narrative and this is what is coursing our anxious nature

What I mean is,  each morning where waking up and peering into our neighbours (states) yards and seeing/hearing what they are doing and being allowed to do!

Fair enough, each state mandates their own rules... but when you log on to the newspapers and stuff, it’s always just a wash of information with no direction

Think of it like an advent calendar? I’m just saying people are going to get edgier and edgier if there isn’t very clear direction."

melbourne,fpqz45p,t1_fpqyvrq,1588836765.0,"Nice one... thanks for the update!

So its easy enough to understand - for me - but just something for the general masses.

Each morning on Today/Sunrise - they seem to go live to the Premiers announcing the numbers from the previous 24 hours and I sort of feel like each day we're cheering them on.

So if as you put, ""a clear framework... to understand how the next few months will look""... is really something we all need"
melbourne,fpqyfte,t3_g8rwt7,1588836116.0,"So just my two cents... but for my wife and I (and others I guess too), feels like we're living in some sort of Ground Hog day.

That's fair enough - no problem here as we understand there is a fair amount of uncertainty at the moment.

But one complaint (sort of) that I have to an otherwise Government doing a wonderful job... is perhaps to set Milestones?

Its absolutely obvious people are getting edgy... and perhaps will start breaking rules. Nobody wants anybody to get sick - and nobody has real answers... But I just feel if the Gov set markers for us to achieve, we may feel again motivated to keep up the great work.

Even something like ""Yes, we may very well have to change our policy and go back on our word... but if we keep our numbers down to X and X and Y to Y - then on May 25th we will release X, Y and Z""

Even if they go backwards on it... we kind of having nothing to aim for. No end in site - no end game and its starting to really weigh up on a lot of us?

TLDR: - State Gov... motivate us to the do the right thing"
melbourne,fpqx4ad,t1_fpqwig7,1588834905.0,"So we have a larger population with lower case fatality rates and cases per million ... yet “you know which is doing better”

Why not compare, say NZ to Adelaide and Perth combined, chuck in ACT too perhaps? Similar populations and those three states are doing hands down better?"
melbourne,fpqt5g7,t1_fpqsd8g,1588831481.0,"What I find interesting though talking with others here is that there is virtually no debate.

Like, I don't particularly like ScoMo... but I'm not going to hate on him.

Other politicians - meh, there all the same. Literally, they are all the same flogging their own wares, it just depends to a degree whether they where a Red shirt or Blue shirt when campaigning.

I never used to like Dan Andrews - but he's been great, so hats off to him.

Adhern - yeah, I agree... cool person, doing her best.

But my oh my... there is no rational debate, or even conversation. Its bordeline vitriolic hate, even for saying something like ""Hey, Scomo tries a bit hard to be good guy, but hats off, we're doing great"".

You would be downvoted... then you get the hate comments.

I don't mind people picking a side... but come on, let's actually have a chat and be open minded, either way"
melbourne,fpqrt9c,t1_fpqptwa,1588830390.0,"Its funny hearing this - 30 odd days later as I tried to raise this in /r/australia or the likes and just got my ass handed to me.

That being - yes, ScoMo/Adhern etc are all just puppets to a degree, listening to academics, scientists, doctors and professionals who have created careers looking into this stuff... and modelling what is arguably a once in a 100 year event.

I was trying to explain that he wasn't sitting in his home office and thinking ""Carn mates, let's just wing it""... but no matter what I said, I was getting flamed.

At one stage I was arguing with a guy who vehemently was telling me it should be better and would have been better if it was the ALP in charge?"
melbourne,fpqpes3,t1_fpqp9if,1588828495.0,"Oh... ok

Could it maybe be Scomo = Lib, Ardern = Labor?"
melbourne,fpqj1px,t1_fpqe2xi,1588823941.0,"What do you mean though reaping the benefits?

From what I can see - Australia has out done (but who's counting) NZ on a lower fatality rate and a lower rate of infection per population?

And that's Australia... so if you compare Victoria which actually has a similar population and size of country and similar urban sprawl... we've actually got less Active cases despite 1m more people and a much less fatality rate.

So why is it always yay for NZ and not yay for Aus???"

Not saying I’d be a lazy parent.ll but at that age, giggle and hoot is a priority and a stroll and your doing great. My wife and I are struggling as we’re getting daily course work for a prep and grade 1. I know we’re meant to relax doing it, I guess, but it’s so difficult to get the kids at that age to concentrate, do as their told and so on. It’s really disrupting the entire house...."
