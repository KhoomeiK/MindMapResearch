ForeverAlone,fc8k6sd,t3_egpseb,1577536629.0,"Two images pop up in my mind when I think about my FA-ness and depression.

One is of a solitary figure wandering about some sort of a mythical underworld where there is permanent semi-darkness, no visible source of light, bare trees, barren land - something like wintry landscape, but without snow cover. Or maybe just a bare tree standing alone somewhere in such scene, but not in the middle.

The other is an image of one of those otherworldly deep sea organisms that live in permanent darkness. I tried to capture the idea once and I came up with this: ""The deep sea creatures roams the darkness at the bottom of the ocean and finds nothing, yet it keeps looking.""

I guess my ideas are too literal and have no artistic merit to them. Maybe you're looking for something more abstract. On the other hand, it may be the way you will choose to realize such ideas in an artwork what will elevate them.

Anyway, I just wanted to share my thoughts."
