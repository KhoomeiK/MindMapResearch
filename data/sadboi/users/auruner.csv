gt86,fq7g99s,t1_fq4s0jp,1589145997.0,"I was thinking about the GR86 too. Trouble is, there are only rumors out right now - nothing concrete. It's expected to have a 2.4L boxer engine. It'll be heavier than the GT86, but not significantly. It's expected to release Summer 2021, but again nothing concrete."
gt86,fq4mhcc,t1_fq4m321,1589079606.0,"I was pushing in that zone for the majority of my test drive. It was exhilarating. I'm looking into test driving a few other cars before I make my final decision, but I don't think anything else will really speak to me like the GT86. I may not have had a 10/10 experience, but my worries about horsepower can be addressed later if needed."
gt86,fq4luft,t1_fq4led0,1589079381.0,"No worries man. So it really boils down to how well a mechanic can install the mods it seems. I'll check them out when I'm more comfortable with the car. Rn, I'm in the early phases of planning to finance a brand new GT86. I'll still test drive other cars, but none have really spoken to me."
gt86,fq4gv79,t1_fq4e9dm,1589077588.0,"Cool. I would think headers, tuning, and all would be easier on the engine. Not sure if custom ordering a GT86 with Brembo brakes and upgraded suspension would be needed."
gt86,fq4glj7,t1_fq4di6o,1589077490.0,I want a manual transmission. The Supra doesn't have one. Plus it's a little outside of my budget (even with a hedty down payment).

dating_advice,fpo4742,t1_fpo2uca,1588778069.0,"I've had a lot of women compliment my hair. In the past, I've gotten my hair trimmed for dates to look neat. Most of the girls I've talked to lately don't mind. But I think that what you say is true. I really do like my hair length - it fits with the musician vibe I'm going for. I dunno, it's something that I would have to think about because it feels like I'm changing myself for someone else.

I can definitely take some more non-selfie pictures! I do live alone, and I'm a little camera shy so I don't take many pictures. I agree that the Escape Room pic makes me look hella short. I just wanted to include pics of all my angles so females have an idea of how short I am. I think I should include a picture of me playing my guitar. It's something I've wanted for a while but have been too shy to ask anyone."

I'm not the brightest, but I'm still intelligent and bring something to the table. 

It took me years to get here. I still have a ways to go. I don't have many friends or family but the ones I do have are pretty good to me. We have our spats every once in a while. I've also found a supportive community. I'm shy, but I'm trying to get myself out there."

depression,fo4wh21,t3_g5bgxl,1587512573.0,I feel for you man. I was depressed for years. Clinically diagnosed as bipolar depressive. But I turned myself around. You're allowed to be depressed and feel what you feel. But don't stay there. It'll do you no good. I have a theory that depression makes us all stronger. It starts with having a positive opinion about yourself.
depression,fo4tj1n,t1_fo4stg9,1587510919.0,"Mate try again. It sounds like you need some quick successes. They don't have to be anything major - the minor ones add up. The religion I practice encourages us to read and gain knowledge. It also encourages positive thinking and has been a game changer for me. I'm not pushing religion on you, but I'd like to leave you with a platitude: ""Let your good deeds be like rain. Drop a little everywhere"". Consider CBT. I've read a great book by David Burns called ""Feeling Good"". Do the exercises."

I've caught a couple of females staring at my chest. It took me close to 6 months to 1 year to get here. I ate A LOT of protein. I'd have 5 eggs, 2 avocados, a banana, and an apple for breakfast and brunch. I'd have chicken and black beans for lunch. A banana and peanut butter smoothie for dinner. I also worked out 5x a week for 1.5 hours. I can't really relate the workout program to you because I'm not sure if you have the equipment. If you can afford it, get a barbell. You can do a lot of exercises with it. 

I'm not showcasing what happened to me not to brag - I'm doing it to feel good about myself. Kidding! I'm showing you my meal plan and the time it took for me to get where I am with a lot of consistent hard work. Don't give up if you're not seeing results - they'll come in time.

1) Reverse your thoughts. Fight back. Write down positive affirmations about yourself that you believe. The one that turns me around is ""I'm a SSJ 13"". Legit believe that too LOL.

2) Break up study time. Your brain can only process so much information. Study for 30 minutes, take a 5 minute ""reward"" break (do something for YOU).

3) Say to yourself ""alert mind, calm body"" when you're freaking out.

4) Remember, success isn't only hard work. Rest, fun times, and eating/sleeping are a big part of it too. I know you're in college and sleep may be the last thing on your mind with homework and exams, but it's important. Eat well too!

5) Change doesn't happen overnight. It takes discipline and hope. Believe you can do it. Take action. BUT remember to be patient. Be invested in the process. Love what you're learning.
