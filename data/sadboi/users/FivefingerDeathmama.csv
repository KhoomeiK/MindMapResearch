Parkinsons,fmtibuz,t3_fwtooj,1586373218.0,"I was diagnosed at 32. I had a very stiff Nick, Weakness all over, tremors in right arm/hand/leg. My sense of smell was gone, I had fatigue,  my handwriting shrunk. I also had bad rest less legs symtopms. At first before diagnosis, I had symptoms for about a year, I thought that my tremors were anxiety related. Finally, i went to er because of high BP and explained my symptoms to a neurologist who referred me to a Movement disorder specialist."

mentalhealth,fi9ri8e,t3_f78nmj,1582278720.0,"I think we are all our own worst enemies. There are things I do not like about myself. I write my feelings in a Journal. I listen to music, go for a walk, or talk to others.  We all also have our ups and Downs in life. Just know there are people out there who care how you're feeling. Don't be hard on yourself, our imperfections make us unique."

Parkinsons,ffnq7dv,t1_fflulbk,1580069269.0,"That is just horrible, sorry you went through this. I think a lot of people don't see Parkinson's as a ""real"" Or ""serious"" Disease."
Parkinsons,fdpw3lr,t3_emjp3d,1578642926.0,"I was diagnosed at 32. I was in denial for a while. I feel personally, telling others is on a personal level as to when-if ever- to tell others."

Parkinsons,fba5p66,t3_ec9h83,1576665942.0,"Personally I get used to shaking sometimes. Depending on how bad it is. 


I really don't shake while falling asleep. I did however before I knew I had young onset would have really bad restless leg syndrome while falling asleep. 

I do not have tremors while asleep,"

Parkinsons,faykyro,t3_e3fkwj,1576402472.0,"I was diagnosed at age 32.. My MRI came back normal.  I had a hospital visit where one neurologist said that my tremors and symptoms were normal. Another neurologist came in and told me that he wanted to see me. He referred me to a specialist and I was diagnosed. I had weakness tremors in my right hand and right leg, stiffness, severe weakness, I had vertigo spells, sense of smell worsened, I tripped more often, my handwriting was small. I can't write or color for long periods. My hand/arm will not let me move like it should. I'm in pain a lot too. Get another opinion if you're not satisfied. A wise nurse I worked with told me something. She told me, you are your own advocate. Listen to your body."
Parkinsons,fayjotp,t3_e3vzsi,1576401853.0,"I am 34, 32 when diagnosed. I share a lot of the symptoms you're explaining. I'd see the doctor/neurologist. Listen to your body. If you're not satisfied with what they say get a second or third opinion. Had one hospital neurologist tell me what was going on with me was normal. I had weakness everywhere, fatigue, tremors, stooped posture, small hand writing my fingers on my  tremor hand were starting to contract (curl up) I constantly had a stiff neck, I was tripping more often, my sense of smell was going away. I also sometimes had violent restless leg syndrome episodes at night. This didn't seem normal to me. I got another neurologist that came and talked to me and he wanted me to be seen by him, from there I was sent to a specialist and diagnosed.  Long response sorry lol. Anyway you're more than welcome to message me if you have  any questions üòä"
Parkinsons,fayinv2,t3_e5onu0,1576401353.0,"Well, I know a  side effect of my old medicine I was on (mirapex) is increased risk of compulsive behavior. My compulsive behavior was eating. I also ate when stressed, and depressed. I gained weight but it could be both the disease and possibly  the medicine imo"
Parkinsons,fayh88b,t3_e6wzmm,1576400667.0,"Okay so I'm 32. I have facial masking, only my right side is mainly affected but my gait can be slow as I'm in pain. Is this still stage 1?"
Parkinsons,faygv4f,t3_e8dc0d,1576400498.0,I have facial masking and my voice is very soft and people tell I sound like I mumble.  People always think I'm mad. I'm not lol.
Parkinsons,faygfvq,t3_eauhi0,1576400309.0,"I was 32 when I was diagnosed. Before I was diagnosed I had severe depression.  After my symptoms became more noticeable, I did get diagnosed with young  onset Parkinson's. I was in shock. I was in denial because when you get such a permanent diagnosis, it's difficult. I was in  denial and was depressed.  I had high anxiety and was delusional at times. I've since accepted my diagnosis but  still go through depression as it is part of this disease. Best wishes."
