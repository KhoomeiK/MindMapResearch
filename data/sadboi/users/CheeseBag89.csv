depression,ewqgsuq,t3_cpidz8,1565665571.0,"I had this exact feeling today! But for me I was feeling like I wanted to go home but to my old home in my home town, back when I was little with my old friends and family and when things were good and I didn’t know what depression even was. That’s where I wanted to go."

walmart,eql781b,t3_byselk,1560138517.0,I swear every fish tank I’ve seen at any Walmart I’ve been to has been nothing but shit. Why do they even sell fish? They’re all dead or at least half dead by the time you buy them.
memes,ep32088,t3_btsvpk,1559015794.0,"I was deployed 2010-2011 and married soldiers who get deployed also find ways to cheat on their spouses who are back home. The amount of infidelity I was aware of was outrageous. So it’s not just some of the spouses who stay home who cheat but some of the ones down range aren’t so innocent either. I was also deployed with my husband at the time and you would think that spouses get deployed together that there will be no way this could because people see everything you do and yet he found a way to cheat on me within the same unit. Some people are just down right disgusting. 

Hats off to those who remain faithful."
