IsItBullshit,fqwk0dg,t1_fqwjc6r,1589707253.0,">It's almost like being a rock legend gives you immunity to prosecution.

Yep, being famous in general unfortunately has that effect.  People like Jimmy Page,  Iggy Pop, and Steven Tyler get to walk free despite it being known that they've committed sexual crimes against minors.  It's truly disturbing this incongruency that the general public wants justice done against pedophiles (which is a good thing), but turn a blind eye to these people because ""oh their music is good"" or whatever.  In reality,  there's no good excuse, yet they have immunity. 

It is good that nowadays famous people tend to be held accountable for their misconduct. So why not do the same with musicians from the past? Yeah we can still like their music,  but we can't let them get away with literal rape because of that."

IsItBullshit,fqwg64s,t1_fqwf2ul,1589703240.0,"So if you read thru the *Life as a Groupie"" section, yes it explains her alleged encounter,  but afterwards has this to say:

>""...her experience with Bowie have been called into question due to timeline issues,"" 

And then goes on to point out that she was *actually* involved with Jimmy Page at the time,  when she was 14 and he was in his mid 20s. Went on to say how she was basically kidnapped in a hotel room by him several times,  which seems to be able to be backed up by eyewitness claims.  

I've read a couple of articles that say the same,  that her claims regarding Bowie seem to be greatly inconsistent. You can read different interviews she's done about this,  and she said different storylines happened.  Another thing to note is that there are no pictures with the two, and there are some pictures of her with other musicians when she was a ""baby groupie"""
