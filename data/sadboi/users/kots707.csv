Anxiety,fq8ksk9,t1_fq8k9ae,1589168522.0,"I think it varies a ton based on location and how much antibody testing they have done, I don’t think it would be possible to have a country wide estimate or anything like that. I’ve seen quite a few metropolitan areas estimated at 30% of the population with antibodies which is enormous and indicates a lot of asymptomatic people. Then you have that Ohio prison that had like 98% asymptomatic or something crazy. Arizona state did a study indication an extremely high level of asymptomatic people as well, I can’t remember the specific results but they were posted in this thread a handful of times. 

Once antibody testing is widespread we will know for sure, but the number seems to be going up, indicating that the most dominant strains of this coronavirus tend to be the ones that are the most contagious and have a high rate of asymptomatic carriers, which makes total sense. The more deadly strains have died out quickly."
Anxiety,fq8j74j,t1_fq8iub0,1589167439.0,"You don’t even have to cross your fingers imo, I’m almost certain it has already become less deadly. There’s a ton of info coming out supporting that claim, and the death percentages and hospitalization percentages in the states and even Europe don’t add up to what was being observed in Asia. I think it’s only a matter of time before experts confirm that this version is more contagious but less deadly. Unfortunately it’s still a dangerous disease, just not what we were seeing originally. we already know this virus presents as asymptomatic for a lot of people and the percentage seems to be potentially going up. That could also indicate its likely to mutate again in the same direction."

Also it’s not our worst 48 hours relative to the amount of testing by a long shot. We started at like 30% positives and now are down below 13% total tests positive and our daily % has been like sub 5 or 6. 

Newsom wouldn’t be allowing places to open if these numbers weren’t there. At the end of April most experts in California were hinting at a large mid May drop in cases and deaths and it SEEMS to be heading that direction.

Outside Southern California, the state is in great shape. We should catch up down here soon though, things are definitely improving. A ton of recent cases are from various jails and nursing homes. 49% of deaths in LA are now from nursing homes which makes up an even higher percentage of cases these pst 3 weeks.

I forget exactly who did the study but it said something like 5% of deaths in New York had patients with asthma, while 8 or 9% of people in New York have asthma. So there were actually less deaths among people with asthma then you would normally expect. 

In France there was a high profile hospital that was tracking cases and demographics closely and they said they didn’t consider asthma to be a risk factor whatsoever. 

That being said if from what I know about asthma I’m pretty sure if you were to develop pneumonia, or something like that I can’t imagine having asthma would help the situation. 

The numbers don’t really show asthma as much of an issue though. The vast majority of deaths are people over 60 who ALSO have hypertension, diabetes, morbid obesity, and in some cases cancer patients. A handful of deaths are aged 40-60 but an even high percentage of them have one or more of the above conditions. Very very few people under 40 have died all things considered, and almost all of them and health problems or were front line doctors/nurses."

In California though over the past week or so we’ve reportedly doubled our total tests given and our number of confirmed cases only went up like 15-20% so while places around here declining in early March seems a little improbable, confirmed daily cases definitely does not indicate spread.

Here’s what I do to help though. 

First off don’t feel bad about not eating, the worst thing you’ll get is a headache or stomach ache, which while unpleasant, isn’t the end of the world. If your body needs food enough, you’ll get hungry, unless you struggle with anorexia, which normally comes from a different place then just general anxiety. Stressing and feeling bad is just gonna make it worse. 

Second, try to take advantage of basic mammal instincts. Get a little scientific with it. Mammal hunger response starts with saliva production. If I’m really struggling to eat I’ll make something that I know is very fragrant so it will trigger my natural hunger response. 

We also have a gorge response. If you haven’t eaten in a while and you have a bite of something, it will trigger your brain into telling you to eat more. This helps mammals to eat as much as they can while they have food, in case they can’t get more later.  Sometimes just a bite of a cookie, or a pack of gummies will be a small enough bite to trigger myself be fully hungry without hurting my stomach. 

Sometimes trying to be as logical as possible can help with anxiety, at least it does for me."

Anxiety,fnefayu,t1_fne9l3s,1586888346.0,Fauci still won’t fund it. Once trump backed it and it said it was our savior it was as good as dead unfortunately. Everything got politicized.
Anxiety,fne9h2r,t3_fj2y1a,1586885394.0,"Hey guys! Who would have thought that tomorrow we would already be halfway through April?! Not me!

Anyways there’s no doubt in my mind that May is gonna look a lot different than April did. Several European countries and well as several US states are mostly likely gonna begin rolling back restrictions sometime in May and its crazy to think we are almost there. 

Keep on, keeping on guys and gals, the countdown to normalcy is right around the corner."
Anxiety,fne8i0b,t3_g14yme,1586884916.0,"Hello there. I think one thing to understand is that right now Xanax has a pretty negative connotation associated with it, however that negative connotation is NOT your fault. It’s because of people who abuse drugs that aren’t meant for them. Sure people get addicted to Xanax due to long term prescription, but the majority of drug dependency from benzos comes from straight up abuse from day 1. 

Don’t feel bad if people don’t understand why you’re taking strong anti anxiety medications, they just can’t relate. 

People who go through bad anxiety attacks understand though. Just be careful, and be honest with yourself if you feel that you are getting more and more dependent on them."
Anxiety,fnbel1j,t1_fnbdjnh,1586814146.0,"Yeah but per capita isn’t all that matters when scale is that different. You’re only projected to have 3 deaths or less per day for the rest of the infection. I might be wrong but I don’t think Idaho gets as much interstate travel as the other 3 states do either, but again I feel like it’s mostly infection scale. Nevada, Arizona, etc weren’t included either, just the three coastal states."
Anxiety,fnbc9u9,t1_fnbbxqx,1586812985.0,"Probably because you guys have had such a small outbreak, Cali Washington and Oregon were hit harder than other western states"
LosAngeles,fnbby8h,t1_fnb4cff,1586812823.0,"Great news. California as a whole has been doing really well, and I understand LA is naturally gonna lag behind other parts of the state, but I’d be lying if I haven’t been a little worried lately."
Anxiety,fnb69dq,t1_fnb60p5,1586809946.0,"Yeah overall the US deaths unfortunately went up a bit, I’m not sure which states that’s due to. However even with states with their peak pushed back, overall deaths still stop around the same time as before, end of April/early March. So overall not much has changed as far as when this will all be over."
Anxiety,fnb4xf3,t1_fnb4hhz,1586809280.0,"Wow I love this. West coast for ever!

Edit: also viva cascadia!"
Anxiety,fnb2zpq,t3_fj2y1a,1586808314.0,"New projections are starting to roll in. California appears to have flattened the curve a little again. About 150 less deaths projected, much less ventilators and icu beds needed at peak, but the peak also got pushed out 4 more days (it was supposed to be today)

overall a good thing, just frustrated at the later peak, especially cause LA is taking a little longer to start getting case reductions. 

Hang in there Californians, we got this."
Anxiety,fnb1azx,t1_fnb0d9t,1586807479.0,I hate flying too. I still do it but it gets worse and worse every time.
warriors,fn5ocwu,t1_fn5o7ot,1586670553.0,I know I was just referring more to the handful of guys someone might claim was the best pg all time. The glove definitely was one of the better two way pgs though and broke the mold a little bit.
warriors,fn5nxx8,t1_fn5nmko,1586670197.0,Gary Payton was a good two way pg for a long time but there were quite a few guys better than him
warriors,fn5ijwu,t1_fn5fxhi,1586665813.0,"But I mean if somebody is asking about the best basketball the best basketball players in the nba and you bring up 1v1 it’s kind of irrelevant. 

I also feel like his size isn’t that big of a deal either. Name 1 all time great point guard who was great scorer and a great defender? And it’s not magic. Magic was big, but he still wasn’t a great defender by any means. Curry’s size also is one of the reasons he has the handles he has, as well as such a quick pull-up game. His size is an easy way to take shots at him, much more than an actual liability on the court the majority of the time. 

Most instances of him getting “targeted” are really instances of him getting mauled off ball and not getting the refs the back him up as well."
warriors,fn4g4u6,t1_fn3xg9k,1586640696.0,"As far as actually impacting the game and how a team is able to play, idk how he’s even outside of the top 5. Stats are not the only thing that matters, and curry affects the game more than any player I’ve ever seen. The only other players on his level of affecting the way a team has to play are like Kobe, mj, wilt, and bill Russell. And even then it’s not nearly as dramatic. If you’re making a starting 5 to go up against any team in history and curry isn’t your point guard, you’re making a mistake. That to me makes him as good as anyone."
Anxiety,fn4amf0,t1_fn49w9o,1586637456.0,"Our flu year was very bad and very early this year, and like I said, a lot of people were testing negative as well when actually getting tested. It was a very “weird” flu season."
Anxiety,fn49qhj,t1_fn45t1l,1586636936.0,"Most states peak in the next few days and seem to have their projected deaths drop off seriously around 10-14 days after the peak of hospital equipment usage. When you combine that with the fact that it usually takes 3+ weeks for someone to die from covid, this would tell me that their shouldn’t be too many new infections leading to death anymore. It’s not that people are reporting this, and maybe I’m wrong, but imo it’s just math/common sense."
