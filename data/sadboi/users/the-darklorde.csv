Like, I cannot even imagine how it feels to not wake up in agony. How can one actually *look forward* to the future??? The last person I dated asked me what I look forward to in the future, and I scoffed and said something like ""nothing??? there's people that are actually excited for the future?"" and he gave me a look, then we broke up like a week later lmao."

Poetry,fninfco,t3_g1kyrg,1586983029.0,I’d like to believe they are trying to appeal to a wider audience. It’s no secret that the attention span of most people today isn’t very long. Writing short “poems” keeps their attention. But I definitely agree these trendy “poets” lack substance for the most part. It’s a shame

AskWomen,fkvgjcr,t3_fko3c9,1584568776.0,"Eventually I became addicted to the pain I felt in each relationship. We both became addicted to the routine of fighting, crying, then ‘making up’. There were multiple times it could’ve ended, but then we would come back for another round. Now that I’m single, I notice myself thinking back to every shitty moment, then I have to snap myself out of it and remind myself how horrible it all was."
