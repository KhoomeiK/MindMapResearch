Writeresearch,foj2yfq,t3_g67lfk,1587806283.0,"You didn‚Äôt say anything offensive, actually it‚Äôs quite heart warming that someone took so much time to really know a topic before misrepresenting it, especially something like this. It‚Äôs really nice!!

Speaking from personal experience!! Talking about PTSD trauma can be extremely hard, since it is VERY easy to trigger myself. For me, i can only talk about it in short bursts. (Which by the way, very good writing that the character wasn‚Äôt able to go on talking about it much longer. Very realistic.) When I do talk about it, I NEED a safe and controlled environment and a person I trust greatly (or am trying to trust, first knowing they are trustworthy ofc). If not, I shut down. My fight or flight (or freeze, honestly I just freeze up) kicks in and it feels like everything around me is buzzing. (It‚Äôs a VERY odd feeling and I don‚Äôt know how else to describe it other then it‚Äôs like the air around me (and I myself) has become tv static.)
The absolute quickest way to make me shut up is to pressure me to talk about it. If I‚Äôm being pressured or if someone is being really pushy, not only do I shut down but it‚Äôs highly triggering and has caused some of my worst episodes.

A trigger of mine used to be blue eyes, so I can relate to your character in that sense. I say ‚Äúused to‚Äù because I have gotten better about it, but admittedly that trigger does flare up at times. It has been harder for me to talk to people with blue eyes, especially if I‚Äôm opening up about my trauma, I usually avoid eye contact the entire time because it WILL make it worse. I swear, one glance to blue eyes while talking about my trauma, and suddenly I feel like I‚Äôve been transported back in time and it‚Äôs happening all over again. So usually I just avoid looking.
But!! I have been able to talk to people with blue eyes about it, so it isn‚Äôt impossible. Harder, but not impossible.


Here are the only reasons why I would talk about the event(s):

-I‚Äôm in a safe environment

-I‚Äôm with someone I feel safe with and trust. I NEED to know the person I‚Äôm talking to won‚Äôt say ‚Äúwhy didn‚Äôt you just [blank]‚Äù or some bullshit like that. Not only is it disheartening, it can reverse months or even years of progress.

-talk therapy. It‚Äôs true that the more you talk about something, the better you can process what happened. Honestly? It‚Äôs the only reason I talk about it at all. That and a lot of times I‚Äôll be unsure if something is supposed to be normal or if I‚Äôm overreacting, and the person I‚Äôm talking to can confirm that yes what I went through was fucked up. A lot of the times I‚Äôll wonder if it even happened, so it‚Äôs nice to have someone reassure me and validate me.
Side note: A huge thing with my ptsd is my mind likes to pull all pulley‚Äôs and levers to tell me that what happened wasn‚Äôt real, it‚Äôs my natural defense mechanism if that makes sense. Which ironically is even more damaging. Talking about it helps it to be real and let‚Äôs me actually process it, whereas I would‚Äôve just bottled it up and let it tear me apart. Lord knows I don‚Äôt want it to be real, but it sure beats being torn apart slowly over time until the inevitable ‚Äúoh fuck that DID happen‚Äù because I did do that for a while, and it hurt a lot more than talking ever will.

-If the person I‚Äôm talking to has been through something similar. It is sometimes nice to compare stories, as odd as that sounds. It‚Äôs strangely validating.
