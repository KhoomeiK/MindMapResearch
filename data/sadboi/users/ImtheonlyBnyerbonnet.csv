I've known of a few people named a variation of Dimitri. One was Dimitrius (black person named for Greek god in mythology) and another was Dimitrios (white, greek heritage), and Demetria who was black and named for her auntie. 

The name is ancient and I think the choice is great. It's not made up, it has a personal connection for you and it's a name still used today. Its unique but classic. 

The man who passed away had a very important and stable influence in your life. People like that are rare, regardless of where they are found.  I think it shows great character to choose a name with personal meaning. 

Your family's reaction is disrespectful of your feelings and a little racist since somehow they think this ancient name is either too white European or not black enough. They are not well informed and I have to wonder why they want to pile on like that.  Trust your instincts as the father and name your child after something good."

AskReddit,fcpe81r,t3_eic8yl,1577860203.0,"Hellsyeah. I already had my graduate degree and was working. My parents were alive. I'd be a better parent and spouse. I'd make myself work when it's work time and take more vacation. 

I'd demand more from my employer and I'd mentor more people in my field. I'd decide against putting my elder cat down and find a sanctuary instead (didn't know about them).

I'd probably cherish a friend and stop avoiding 80%of my social obligations.

Thanks.  Now I'm depressed. happy new year, I'll just stop here.

Edit:  pffft  weight.  Seriously?

Edit 2: I'd buy a different house before my kids grew up so much, I'd get my kids better help when they needed it,  I'd lobby in Washington,  I'd write a better thesis,  I'd save my music collection more carefully. 
My god is there anything I don't regret?"
GenderCritical,fcp6hrm,t1_fcoox3r,1577852072.0,"I think I see what you mean.  Jazz would like to have that romance.  We all (usually) want to connect with another person on an intimate level.  Without the sexual arousal I think it will be a real challenge.  It's difficult enough to have a relationship when the sex drives are not in sync with each other.  One person ends up feeling rejected.  
When I was younger and more idealistic I think I believed that sex was a smaller part of a relationship, albeit a critical part.  Now I'm old, and I've been through it and back. Sex is a huge part of a relationship.  I don't think it's the same for one person or another but it's going to be a big deal in one way or another to every participant."

GenderCritical,fcmxz2o,t3_ei0vad,1577797109.0,"I didn't check my sources first but if I recall correctly Jazz Jennings had lots of medicalization with puberty blockers and then cross sex hormones.  Chances are there will be little sexual feeling remaining. That is a lot of work to look like something that can't function physiologically.  I've had ""intimate relations"" when my sexual feeling was temporarily broken. It's a waste of time for everyone.
I don't like to reduce everything to such simple terms but it makes me curious how some of these people are going to great lengths to change outward appearance so they can look like the opposite sex. Usually this is done to mimic a cartoonish stereotype.    What is the cost for the children who will look more like the opposite sex but have difficulty with intimacy and sexual feeling?"
GenderCritical,fcjr2mm,t3_ehgt71,1577700358.0,"Briefly,  if the parents were present at all during the decision to pursue medical therapy then they are relegated to knowing that if they support  it, and subsequently the child either loses the ability to have intimate sexual feeling or is sterile or both, they will be blamed for allowing that for a child. 

If they don't support the decisions then they are blamed for the ineffectiveness of the treatment. (Surely parental support would change the outcome)"
