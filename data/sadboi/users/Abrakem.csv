BPDsupport,fqq6vfm,t3_gk9is5,1589560412.0,"I really hate when I feel this way.

Sometimes I feel these feelings so much. The worst part is knowing how fabricated they are. My own brain chooses to turn to these negative concepts when my anxiety and depression are not able to be managed or abated. It turns memories into fuel for doubt and warps my feelings towards the world, myself, and pretty much everyone.

It may not be applicable, but one thing I have learned from therapy and a close friend is the concept that you do not need to be ruled by the emotions. Its ok to feel that terrible. Its ok to acknowledge how you feel. Its not wise to let those emotions pick your destination. Accept that you feel terrible and that its a real sensation, but remember your reaction to it can be tempered with enough practice. The feelings pass. Distractions are advisable.

I would also add that the way we speak and write our thoughts can keep us stuck in absolutes. Each word we use and say to ourselves is a truth we begin to accept. It sticks. The narrative these absolutes build shape a character who we are not. 

I can hate myself quite intensely, but do I hate me all the time? Do I give myself permission to? Maybe it could be ""Sometimes I really hate how I feel about myself"". This removes the absolute and gives me room to explore emotions outside of the chains of my black and white thinking. Instead of letting my emotions clamp down like a trap, I am able to have some pause to consider the pathology of why I am feeling this way. I am given a moment to look for untruths.

Perhaps you are not seeking advice. I do not mean to challenge or minimize what you are going through. I just want to share with you what has helped me get through the bad thoughts. I am not always successful in employing these skills, but I appreciate all of the times they have helped me keep my face out of the mud.

I am sorry that words are all I have. I know they cannot ""cure"" you or I. I just know that I cant do this if lies and doubt are my only companions."

This video was extremely helpful and covers pretty much every aspect of what you will need to make a decent pond. It takes a bit to wade through, but is worth it (and it may leave you feeling relaxed!)

This website indicates that your pond gallons will be around 1,500:  [https://www.swimmingpool.com/maintenance/water-care/pool-volume-calculator/](https://www.swimmingpool.com/maintenance/water-care/pool-volume-calculator/)

You can save quite a bit of money on a pond filter if you dont mind DIY. I am 100% unskilled in DIY projects / using tools in general, but it was pretty easy to accomplish. I used a garbage can  and a few PVC pipes. I also did my own bio filter.

That said, you can get any pond filter you want, I would just make sure it can handle the gallons you need it to. A rule of thumb provided in the above video is to **""Make sure the pump can circulate all of your pond gallons every two hours""**

Here is a helpful article with advice on how many fish you should have for your pond.

>Second, experts advise to keep at four or under four koi per 1,000 gallons of pond water, so as to enable a healthy environment for the fish to grow and thrive

AskReddit,fpvqkbg,t3_gfswgw,1588949993.0,"Doctor Sleep.

I love The Shining. I read Doctor Sleep and was so excited when I heard they were adapting the movie.

The book was not that upsetting in terms of Stephen King material. It was campy and a great continuation of the story. 

Apparently the director of the movie thought it was important to really drive home how bad the already established bad guys were. 10+ minutes of a kid getting brutally tortured and murdered while he screams. Asking if its going to hurt as they drag a blade down his stomach, etc... Dont forget all of the flashbacks to it, cause damn, it would be horrible if the audience somehow forgot about your child torture fantasy. The first fucking scene of the movie already had them killing a kid off screen. Why not do the same? 

I did some reading because hey, I must not be the only person who was indignant over this and struggled hard after seeing it.  Apparently the actress who played the main villain really wanted to not do the scene. Several actors had asked the director to skip over the scene and also have his death (Which is important to the story) be done off screen. The director insisted it was just SO important to make us watch this child killed off snuff style. Heaven forbid his directing genius be stifled.

I turned it off sobbing. I didnt get to finish a movie that could have been done in better taste. Now I have a really poor feeling towards every actor / actress in the film and a poor feeling towards the entirety of the shining story.

Its sad, because they had nailed everything else. It felt like a true spiritual continuation from the first film."

These posts are why r/BPD has rule #4. I wish this subreddit had some similar guidelines for the sake of everyone. That said, I do not want to minimize OP's struggles. I am sure any of us who are trying to recover remember those dark times. Those lonely times where we are not understanding the depth of the pain we feel, or why its there. Those times when we suddenly find ourselves completely hating those we love. Times where we are wanting to stop making impulsive decisions and to halt the feeling of needing to cease. The alone times.

People with BPD have usually gone the rounds to be diagnosed. I am 35. It took a long time for my symptoms to manifest. Sure, I had my own dark times as a teen, but those times built the malformed coping mechanisms that make my adult life socially bereft.

When I came across the concept of BPD it was pre-therapy. I had read that BPD was a ""Womens disorder"". As a male, this made me even more hesitant to look into it. I had never had counseling of any kind, so I felt dumb walking in and saying ""I THINK I HAVE BPD!!!"". The whole experience took energy I just didnt have.

The concept of ""splitting"" and ""black and white thinking"" felt like they explained my social tactics. I went to my primary care giver and told them what I surmised. They provided me with a few options. Medication or therapy. I will forever be thankful that I tried therapy after I realized something was ""off"". Nearly every relationship that I had was damaged in some form. Eventually I did get on medication. That with therapy has very much helped me when navigating my emotions in the moment.

I had a vastly abnormal childhood compared to my peers. Taking all of the past and looking at all the emotional cracks was very difficult, but the further we got into my sessions, the more I learned that BPD fit like a very itchy glove. For me though, I finally understood why things were difficult. The enemy could no longer hide and I could learn to fight back.

Thousands of dollars and years of therapy. I know full well that I have BPD, but there will always be a me that wrestles with such an absurd concept.

My therapist refers to the teenage me as a ""Budding borderline"".

I am sad that OP is feeling the way they do. I wish I had understood what BPD was when I was their age. If I was OP and I had the understanding that ""I might have this."", I would immediately start reading books.

u_CookieByte_Games,flyc5er,t3_f27jtv,1585599399.0,"Looks like a lot of work went into this. I initially thought you were keyword spamming me with ""XCOM"" and ""Heroes of Might and Magic"". I mean... You were, but it seems like this may deliver?

I will keep an eye on this :)"

BPDmemes,flu0x5g,t3_fjwutt,1585492661.0,"I would prefer them adding ""(BorderlineBarbie)"" to the end of a low effort title/caption. I have been pretty annoyed by the titles on more than one occasion. While having to filter out the posts is one solution, I would prefer to keep seeing the content. The memes are funny. A small effort on the part of the author would most likely have avoided this kind of petty frustration while also allowing for unobtrusive self promotion. 

I do agree that ""BorderlineBarbie"" as a name is somewhat stigmatic, but its no more stigmatic then the rest of the memes posted here. Some ""BPDMemes"" have nothing to do with BPD. Nearly all of them highlight the darker or more shameful sides of the disorder."
XCOM2,flkoutq,t3_fpd8c9,1585244920.0,"My biggest hesitation with the switch was lack of xcom 2 :)

I still got one. This just made my day!

Hopefully they take the port seriously and its not plagued by as many inappropriate for retail issues. I need to feel confident that my game wont crash and take my ironman game with it like it has on PS4... twice."

Dogfree,flgklhp,t1_flggd6g,1585144794.0,Right? Its not waterboarding. I am pretty sure a large majority of them simply vibrate around the dogs neck. Imagine how many dog collars you could buy for $275. Imagine just not having a dog.

BorderlinePDisorder,fle9ov8,t3_fo8hmj,1585080206.0,"I relate for sure. Sometimes I apologize to people without much context, letting them know I am sorry for being so terrible. Guess what? Nobody thinks I am terrible but me. Its a silly feeling to come out of.

Gotta tell your brain to not say such mean things about you. I know it isnt that easy, but if you catch yourself being mean just tell yourself ""Fuck off with that shit.""

Assholes dont usually have enough time to worry about being an asshole.

At the very least, let a licensed therapist tell you that you are an asshole before you diagnose yourself <3"

Lovely in its own difficult to observe sorta way :)"
