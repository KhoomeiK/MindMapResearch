gardening,fr2smbd,t3_gm71fq,1589843099.0,so pretty! how long did it take for them to bloom from the seed? i’m pretty new to starting stuff from the seed and i’m reallyyy wanting some fox glove lol
trees,flv8kjb,t1_flumhjl,1585518630.0,i did something similar! i meant to pay for $5 in gas (yeah i was broke) but for some reason told the guy 5 cents and he didn’t even question it??? got my change back and everything too lol. got to the pump and it wouldn’t go past 5 cents so my dumbass went back in and argued with him until i realized my change was still in my jacket pocket. was horribly humiliating
KindVoice,fkqqjmr,t1_fkqp8u5,1584453221.0,so far no. just the symptoms i mentioned and some nausea. i think i’m gonna stay out today and tomorrow and see after that...i think i just got really spooked when i found out someone i’ve been hanging out with potentially has it. just found out they’ve deemed her a presumptive positive case...i just don’t wanna be freaking out over nothing. bc i am young and honestly a lot of people i work with are staying home anyways so there won’t be that many people there. idk this whole situation is just so confusing

TrueCrime,fczq7px,t3_ejno6a,1578106690.0,do you mind sharing what documentary it was? i’m currently looking for more true crime docs to watch
depression,fbsrjgy,t1_fbsfc1o,1577059289.0,"yeah it was years before i realized “oh, other people don’t fight with their parents like that all the time.”"
depression,fbsaalv,t1_fbs9lig,1577052423.0,"the same happens with us! anytime i express any type of emotion or try to tell her how i feel she somehow always turns it back around to herself. she makes it out like i’ve had it so easy and she had such a horribly shitty life. like i should feel bad for even being depressed.

parents suck sometimes lol"
introvert,fbs27t0,t3_ee71f7,1577049241.0,i’ve always wanted to go to a club like that! i’m 21 but i’ve literally just gotten into partying and i’m really enjoying it lol. the few people i hang out with aren’t super into it like me though. reading this actually made me feel a little better about going places by myself! i guess i gotta realize it’s more common than i think and literally no one really cares if you’re by yourself or not.
depression,fbs0nxo,t3_ee58qm,1577048653.0,i literally had the same thing happen to me. i overheard my mom laughing about how i was so dramatic and that i needed to realize i didn’t have it “as bad as other people.” one time we had a total screaming match and i told her i wanted to kill myself. her response was not to “put that on her.”
depression,f8x3qit,t1_f8x21z0,1574907420.0,yeah idk i’ve just felt particularly down today. more like a failure than i have in a while
