iphoneSE2,fqz5r4g,t1_fqxay9m,1589760451.0,"Yeah, basically lol or go to an Apple store once they open back up around me."
iphoneSE2,fqz5o9i,t1_fqx9sdt,1589760402.0,Support just told me to get back in contact with them again if it gets worse and I start noticing issues. I also used a wireless charger for a while when I first got the phone but now I‚Äôve mostly been using my iPad charger (12 watt I think) I also have a fast charger that I occasionally use. I use my phone a lot so maybe that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs saying that. Idk I hope it doesn‚Äôt turn into a problem.
iphoneSE2,fqz59v0,t1_fqxatwq,1589760167.0,Apple support said it‚Äôs rather normal and I should just check for anymore issues in the near future and contact them again if I need to. If it drops more than this anytime soon I‚Äôll go back to them I guess.
iphoneSE2,fqz527c,t1_fqyd7ci,1589760052.0,"Do you still use the same phone now? And yeah I‚Äôm reading everyone has phones that are like 6 months old that are still reading 100% capacity while others are showing a lower amount? I can‚Äôt imagine someone using their device for 6-12 months and it not losing any capacity what so ever. I‚Äôm kind of assuming that mine is going to stay at 98 for a while too. It‚Äôs a little worrisome but I haven‚Äôt noticed poor battery life. I wish I hadn‚Äôt checked it to be honest because it‚Äôs just my luck though. I know people with the XS and 11 pro complained about the capacity dropping shortly from purchase too so maybe it‚Äôs not a big deal, just frustrating. I guess I can always get it replaced whenever though. Hopefully this battery doesn‚Äôt start crapping out on me anytime real soon."
explainlikeimfive,fqy7h5d,t1_fqwyqmr,1589743894.0,This is my problem right now especially during the pandemic. The other night I fell asleep at 4 am and was happy about it. It feels like I‚Äôm slowly turning into an insomniac and I don‚Äôt like it.
explainlikeimfive,fqy6ly2,t1_fqwokhy,1589743469.0,"Lol I‚Äôm not even able to sleep this well during this pandemic. I‚Äôll fall asleep in the morning and sleep all day. I hate this. Myself being a night owl as well, it‚Äôs getting quite insane for me."
iphoneSE2,fqy4zr3,t1_fqwkim1,1589742676.0,"This issue was happening on Xs and 11 pro models too. The batteries are new but slightly vary with how they perform and last over time. Idk why any would degrade that quickly though as mine also dropped (battery life still seems fine though), hoping the meter is just inaccurate. I‚Äôve seen some people on here with batteries at 100% months after launch just randomly drop down a few percentage points after an update or something."
iphoneSE2,fqy4nfo,t1_fqy4dn9,1589742516.0,I‚Äôm assuming your phone settings just says 100% though right? I guess you won the battery lottery. I‚Äôm a little jealous lol mine is showing 98%
iphoneSE2,fqxz6zt,t1_fqxp0va,1589740065.0,Yeah no problem. Apple support basically just said a little degradation is normal (though this fast? Idk) and to just report back if I notice it getting worse and degrading rapidly in the near future. I‚Äôm thinking/hoping it‚Äôll stabilize. I haven‚Äôt noticed any significant drops in battery life either so far but I only noticed the lower health last night.
iphoneSE2,fqx55d5,t1_fqwyqs6,1589726030.0,I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs just a discrepancy between batteries or software misreporting the stat to me. So far this morning my battery life has been great so haven‚Äôt noticed much of a difference there. Only time I‚Äôve experienced quicker drain is while on Facebook but that app is known for that. I did talk to support and they basically told me that it‚Äôs rather normal and to go back if it keeps happening. Hopefully it‚Äôll level out and stay at 98 for a bit. At least I can eventually get the battery replaced easily if needed.
iphoneSE2,fqwnwrm,t1_fqwnnt9,1589711451.0,"The Apple stores by me are still closed (they‚Äôre in malls).

I read quite a few iPhone 11 pros were having similar issues.

Edit: I just sent a message to support. I‚Äôll update."
iphoneSE2,fqwipjn,t1_fqwimt3,1589705873.0,Do you think I should contact Apple or maybe it‚Äôs a software issue that a factory reset would fix?
iphoneSE2,fqwgyq1,t1_fqwghtx,1589704050.0,I wish I could bring it to the Apple store and have them run some tests :( it was still on 100% a few days ago.
iphoneSE2,fqwgwz5,t1_fqwgmgz,1589704000.0,Yeah I heard of this too. People with iPhone 11 pros also reporting issues like this. Once I backup everything I might try a reset. Maybe it‚Äôs an iOS 13 issue or an app eating up the battery. The phone is still almost brand new.
iphoneSE2,fqwbhnd,t3_gl2gxn,1589698630.0,Just checked mine and it‚Äôs down to 98% after getting it on the 24th of last month. I feel like that‚Äôs not normal.
AskReddit,fqusoih,t3_gkwoe8,1589663988.0,"When people continuously ask me, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong?‚Äù when I‚Äôm in the middle of a mental breakdown.

Thoughts aren‚Äôt always easy to explain but I feel pressured to give an answer even if I barely have one. I know people mostly have good intentions and just want to understand and try to help but just being there is enough sometimes. 

I also hate when people ask me, ‚ÄúWhat are you?‚Äù when we first meet. I‚Äôm mixed btw so I always get this one. I feel like that‚Äôs less of ‚ÄúI‚Äôm interested and curious‚Äù and more of them trying to decide if they like me because of my background lol."

iPhoneSE,fqrjnh7,t3_gkezwa,1589585691.0,"I love it so much. I used to have a 6 as my first iPhone so it holds a little nostalgia to me. When I had the 7+ I missed the smaller size. When I had the XR I missed Touch ID. I love the classic albeit older design. The battery life is adequate for my uses and lasts 2 hours longer than my pixel 3 did despite the smaller battery. I get around 6 hours of screen time with it. I also love the good quality LCD that doesn‚Äôt hurt my eyes like the oled on the pixel did. I was able to get used to a small phone again rather quickly and it feels perfect. I‚Äôm also loving little things like the satisfying click of the haptic home button, the standard 16:9 aspect ratio, and the rectangular screen. I was over the tall and rounded edge displays when I tried them. This phone just seems very practical and puts function over form. The camera is even great even though it‚Äôs only one lens. Overall, I‚Äôm quite impressed by this speedy little thing."
iPhoneSE,fqriqhq,t3_gkh03d,1589585164.0,My battery life has been good. I get around 6 hours of screen time on a full charge. I play some light games and mostly use social media. It‚Äôs definitely better than my last phone which had a larger battery.

I wanted to add that the display on my pixel would give me migraines and with the SE all of that went away. The SE seems easier on the eyes, due to the nice LCD I guess. I also am a girl with small hands and find the size okay. The SE to me at least, is mostly perfect."
iphoneSE2,fqp8ky6,t3_gjlpjl,1589538879.0,I always loved that gold color on the 8.
iphoneSE2,fqp8ibr,t1_fqoh225,1589538805.0,What color did you get? I got the black SE and find it looks pretty similar to the Jet black since it‚Äôs black and not space gray and the glass back has a similar glossy look to the Jet black 7. That jet black 7 was a hit though. I also really loved that slate black iPhone 5.

I think the display on the SE is much better for me also because the OLED display on the P3 seemed to give me headaches especially when used in bed on low brightness. Once I switched to the iPhone with an LCD display all of the headaches and migraines stopped. It‚Äôs quite nice, got a new phone and cured a health issue lol"
Scams,fqmyc37,t3_gjpyu2,1589485574.0,"I get so many of these emails it‚Äôs insane.

iPhoneXR,fqmxugm,t3_gjpgu4,1589485340.0,My moms XR turned off once randomly when she first got the phone like a year ago. It was so strange.

I‚Äôve been trying hard to get rid of things after nearly hoarding all of my old stuff because I thought I might need it (I didn‚Äôt) or because I thought it had some sort of sentimental value to me.

iPhoneSE,fqljpg4,t3_gjk9b6,1589459863.0,My SE lasts me all day even with the small battery. The capacity is even smaller than my google pixel 3 but lasts me 2 hours longer. Apple has some good optimization skills. I get 6 hours SOT with my SE compared to 4 on the pixel.

pettyrevenge,fqkm88e,t1_fqkhv0c,1589430464.0,"Yeah I feel their pain with this one.

My mom will still complain if I forget anything or buy stuff that‚Äôs too expensive. And I have to get everyone‚Äôs meds from the pharmacy. Once you start doing more for people their expectations get higher and you‚Äôre a bad person for not doing more. At least that‚Äôs how it is in my house...I‚Äôm expected to do more because everyone in my house has excuses as to why they can‚Äôt (back pain, headaches, anxiety, etc) Not sure what they‚Äôre going to do once I finally move out."
pettyrevenge,fqkl6mf,t1_fqkcnq0,1589429782.0,Same. I have small hands. I use shorter/smaller cutlery and my boyfriend uses the big ones.
pettyrevenge,fqkl3b7,t1_fqjnpxr,1589429726.0,I use the shorter forks and spoons in my house because I have small hands. Whenever I make food for my boyfriend I give him the bigger fork and I use the small one.

iPhoneSE,fqdblv5,t1_fqdb3f3,1589285780.0,"I mean the design is slightly different from the 8 but I found threads online from people who even had the iPhone X, 11 pro, and older iPhones who talked about having the same issue. I think it‚Äôs really common and is just part of manufacturing. Someone also compared it to the Apple watches and how some dials may be slightly looser than others. Just slight manufacturing discrepancies between plants I guess. My old iPhone could‚Äôve had it too and I never noticed. If it makes you feel any better I just checked my boyfriends 6s plus and he had a very slight wiggle on mute too."
iPhoneSE,fqdavhf,t1_fqdafaa,1589285195.0,"My 2DS xl had a wobbly hinge lol. And yeah that‚Äôs understandable. I mean if it‚Äôll make you feel better you can exchange it but that might be more trouble than it‚Äôs worth and you could get something worse. I guess try to convince yourself that it‚Äôs not an issue and force yourself to ignore it like I did. Mine is like yours I think, so slight that it doesn‚Äôt even feel defective. And it‚Äôs only when it‚Äôs in the mute position for me as well. Maybe it‚Äôs just the way it‚Äôs made tbh.

Edit: I actually just looked it up and saw that it‚Äôs actually really widespread across many iPhones. So it might just be the way some iPhones are manufactured?"
iPhoneSE,fqd9q5j,t1_fqd79n5,1589284253.0,"This might be a little TMI for this sub but I have anxiety and OCD tendencies/symptoms and used to inspect my devices which impeded use of it more than the minor flaw. But I made a promise to myself that I wouldn‚Äôt inspect the new phone or look for scratches and I would use it normally. Nothing is perfect after all. I‚Äôm actually proud of myself for not doing so but I‚Äôve been obsessing over things like ‚Äúdid I get the right color or make a good decision?‚Äù :( My iPad got tiny little dot scratches on the aluminum back (from dirt getting stuck in the case) You barely can notice them but it really drove me crazy. I slapped the case back on and told myself to stop. When I first got it I also kept looking at it to make sure it didn‚Äôt have bendgate. My iPad is literally fine but I sat there looking for issues and it made me actually feel sick. I noticed my phone did that very slightly but I have a case on it and can‚Äôt feel it anymore because of the raised lip maybe? I noticed it the day I got the SE and my boyfriend and mom told me to quit obsessing over it because they know how I am. But I think little discrepancies with the feel of the buttons and rocker is quite common with iPhones. It would be nice if Apple fixed it but they‚Äôre just such common issues with small buttons like that I guess. Is yours really bad though? Like so wobbly you feel like it‚Äôll break? Mine is very very slight. I also came from a pixel 3 which had known horrible QC issues. That phone had so many widespread issues ugh. 

I had to basically tell myself that my phone is a tool and it is never going to be perfect and a random scratch will most likely just pop up one day. I had to force myself to stop looking for issues or giving them any attention even if I notice any minor imperfection. However, if you feel like taking it back you always have that option. Just know that your new device may have a small imperfection also. It‚Äôs so unavoidable. Idk if that helped any."
iPhoneSE,fqcz4mh,t1_fq5hgtx,1589273953.0,I noticed mine did a little bit. It doesn‚Äôt bother me lol and that‚Äôs coming from someone who obsessing over their things like crazy. Who knows it may have gotten a little better. Nothing is ever perfect I guess. I‚Äôve accepted it and I‚Äôm happy that aside from that almost non issue my device is perfect. I‚Äôm sure many other iPhones do that too.
iphoneSE2,fqcyvtv,t1_fqcxfsc,1589273713.0,Good words of wisdom here lol that‚Äôs what I considered when buying the SE too
iphoneSE2,fqcrlvg,t1_fqcqi1a,1589266651.0,"Yeah my battery life has been great too, 6 hours of screen on time easy. I love having Touch ID again too and if I would‚Äôve went with the 12 I would‚Äôve lost it. Idk I feel like you really can‚Äôt go wrong either way. The SE is quite nice."
iphoneSE2,fqbfizw,t3_ghwf68,1589236030.0,Mine is like that until I click on it and make it full screen.
iphoneSE2,fqbfdxe,t1_fqbd8cq,1589235958.0,I hope my black phone ages well in that case. That was my only concern but I always have a case on so I should be okay. I‚Äôve had my iPad for a year now (space grey air 3) it still looks pretty good.
iphoneSE2,fqbe7ez,t1_fqbctl3,1589235351.0,"Yeah and the good thing is that all iPhones run the same software so you wouldn‚Äôt be missing out on that by going with one option over another. And I don‚Äôt play any heavy games just light ones and I find the battery life to be okay for that. I get around 6 hours with normal social media use and stuff. I‚Äôm sure gaming would drain the battery a little quicker but if you plan on gaming for hours at a time I would have a charger nearby anyway. I heard that it‚Äôs okay for some people who play a little bit of pubg. But I‚Äôm not entirely sure about gaming myself. I‚Äôm also not sure about how gaming would be once the battery starts to naturally degrade overtime. However since the S9 battery life seems to be very similar to my pixel 3, you should get slightly better battery life like I do if not the same while gaming."
iphoneSE2,fqbbqs3,t1_fqbacj1,1589234084.0,The 5.4‚Äù iPhone will have a smaller footprint but a larger full screen display which will appeal to many. I think the larger display might make reachability a little more difficult. I like the idea of the 12 a lot but at the same time I prefer Touch ID which only the SE has and the standard 16:9 aspect ratio and rectangular screen. I‚Äôm not the biggest fan of curved displays. I feel like both would be really compelling options but the iPhone 12 also isn‚Äôt coming out for a while still and by the time the 12 comes out the talk of a newer 13 will already begin. That‚Äôs why I feel like it may be better to focus on what you can afford now and what fits your needs the best now. If you want to switch later you can do that as well by trade in or selling.
iphoneSE2,fqb71t6,t1_fqb6d7p,1589231708.0,If you find the display size to be fine and the bezels don‚Äôt bother you then that‚Äôs all that matters. I was a bit hesitant at first and wondered if I had made the right decision. I wanted people‚Äôs opinions but you just have to try it out for yourself. There‚Äôs always going to be someone who has a different opinion. I just had to ignore the hate and I really see it as a great little device. Performance is great and battery life should be fine if you‚Äôre coming from an S9. I believe battery life between the S9 and the pixel 3 is pretty similar.
iphoneSE2,fqb5k5p,t1_fqavvbx,1589230959.0,It sounds like you really are leaning towards getting the SE. I think you should look at it in person and if you like it go for it. I get decent battery life (around 6 hours of screen time) and the display looks to be very good quality and is very color accurate. I came from a pixel 3 with smaller bezels and an OLED display. I adjusted to the smaller size within a week (although noticeable at first) and I found I actually prefer the SEs LCD screen quality to the pixel 3 display. The pixel 3 OLED screen used to give me headaches. Touch ID is also quite nice and fast.
iphoneSE2,fqb18y8,t1_fqaw2r1,1589228811.0,Eh you have the best of both worlds now lol
iphoneSE2,fqav1ga,t1_fqauc78,1589225770.0,That‚Äôs funny because I also had a silver iPhone 6. I hadn‚Äôt thought of that though. I also had a rose gold 7+ and a pink pixel 3. I never had all black devices. I have a space grey iPad and the black SE now lol. I wasn‚Äôt too fond of having a phone that was 2 different colors like the white back/black screen. It definitely grew on me though.
iphoneSE2,fqatvdu,t3_ghtf5a,1589225196.0,I chose the black one because I wanted it to be the same color all around and match. At first I wanted the white but I kind of wanted a white screen with it? Unpopular opinion lol. But it was a very tough decision though.
iphoneSE2,fqas6ep,t1_fqaa35k,1589224357.0,If you turn off True Tone the display will look less yellow. The True Tone adjusts white colors to background lighting you‚Äôre in so it makes whites on the phone appear more natural if that makes sense.

Mine was okay but I had previously used iPhones and wanted to switch again when I heard the SE with the home button was coming out. My battery actually lasts me much longer than my pixel 3 did despite the smaller battery. Is this your first iPhone? 

To add to the camera, I found that the gallery was kinda compressing my photos to save space on iCloud making them look slightly blurry. I noticed that the blur went away once zoomed in so I know it wasn‚Äôt the camera. I had to adjust settings and now my photos look great. I turned off ‚Äúoptimize iPhone storage‚Äù and checked ‚Äúdownload and keep originals‚Äù I also changed the camera format from high efficiency to most compatible. I upgraded my iCloud storage too just in case. But those are some tips in case you experience that. The phone actually takes really good pictures.

iphoneSE2,fq4y3qp,t1_fq4xtw6,1589087058.0,If it‚Äôs within the return period then no. I got an iPad once that was scratched out of the box.

iphoneSE2,fq4ukrg,t3_gguocd,1589084513.0,Oof that sucks. I haven‚Äôt had any of those issues but it‚Äôs awesome that you‚Äôre getting a replacement.
iPhoneSE,fq4ugr6,t3_ggudwm,1589084437.0,The camera is also bigger on the SE. The SE also has an extra bottom grill speaker than the 6s where the headphone jack was. I believe only 7 and 8 cases will correctly fit it.

iPhoneSE,fppjl6m,t1_fppj6oo,1588803473.0,"Are you still having issues with it? I saw your other post lol. And yeah the colors on this display look more saturated than on my moms XR. It also looks a little more crisp imo. Maybe that‚Äôs due to the smaller screen or something. I‚Äôm not being biased or anything, just an honest observation. It was a little confusing to me too."
iPhoneSE,fppis8l,t1_fpoguea,1588803043.0,"When I tried the XR from the 7 plus last year I missed it. My cousin still had the rose gold 7 plus and I would just stare at it wishing I hadn‚Äôt gotten rid of mine. But now funny enough, she upgraded to the XR and I‚Äôm happy to be back with a new SE. Smaller screen is fine for me because I have baby hands lol."
iPhoneSE,fppi00p,t1_fpoy3kf,1588802630.0,My pixel 3 battery is nearly double the capacity of the SE yet performs significantly worse. ~4 hours compared to ~6 I‚Äôve been getting with my SE. That‚Äôs just insane to me.
iPhoneSE,fpphqo1,t3_geodyz,1588802493.0,This is awesome because I keep seeing the tech community on YouTube bashing it for its small battery. It‚Äôs obvious most people judging haven‚Äôt used it enough or at all to tell. It lasts me 6 hours as well so it‚Äôs good to know I‚Äôm not the only one getting decent battery life. It lasts me around 2 hours longer than my pixel 3 did that has nearly double the capacity. That just goes to show that Apple knows how to optimize and the spec sheet doesn‚Äôt always replicate real life use. Never judge a book by its cover :)
iphoneSE2,fppc4ou,t3_gecx29,1588799601.0,I like that is nearly covers the entire edge of the phone. All of the ones I‚Äôve tried look too small and bubble up. I‚Äôll probably pick them up since it‚Äôs only $10.
iphoneSE2,fppbhnp,t1_fpn6fvb,1588799277.0,I posted a picture of mine on here a little while ago. You can look at it to compare if you want to. Mine looks really dark and nice imo.
iphoneSE2,fpn65ns,t1_fpmop2f,1588751586.0,"Yeah I have other cases too but when I saw that they made the pink sand case for the SE I couldn‚Äôt resist. My favorite color is pink lol. So far, this feels pretty smooth. I don‚Äôt drop my phone much but I‚Äôm still trying to keep it looking nice. I had some money left on a gift card so I figured I‚Äôd try it. This is the first time buying an Apple case. I did hear some people say theirs started peeling overtime but I‚Äôm not sure if they fixed that. Hopefully it lasts me."
iphoneSE2,fpmzoga,t1_fpmb1oj,1588745970.0,"Yup, silicone case in pink sand. It feels and looks great."
iPhoneSE,fpm195o,t1_fpm0yna,1588723501.0,Well thanks for the recommendation. I just downloaded it because it was free lol.
iPhoneSE,fplvjb6,t1_fplv8ty,1588720291.0,I haven‚Äôt tried that yet. I‚Äôve only ever used the regular camera app but I want to try neural cam
iPhoneSE,fplmtby,t3_gdjicb,1588715564.0,I get 6 hours of screen time so it should be fine for you. I think you posted this twice though. I read it somewhere else lol
iPhoneSE,fplm43o,t3_ge4hoj,1588715192.0,I don‚Äôt have the 7 to compare but I can say that the SE speakers sound really loud and clear to me.
iPhoneSE,fpldbj7,t1_fpkw3g2,1588710672.0,"Lmao same. I‚Äôm like ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need an expensive flagship, the software is the same.‚Äù But seriously this phone performs the same as a flagship and even quicker than my 2019 iPad Air?? And the battery life is much better than I was anticipating. I just got a pink sand silicone case from Apple for my black SE and I‚Äôm even more in love."
apple,fplcu1y,t1_fpl05wm,1588710428.0,Wow! When was this? That‚Äôs awesome and my boyfriend still uses the 6s plus so I know the 1st gen SE still performs well.
iPhoneSE,fplclit,t1_fplafit,1588710310.0,My pixel usb c 3 adapter and iPad brick works too (fast charging) lol. Why buy one if what I have will work??
OCD,fpkfvee,t1_fpkfrif,1588693937.0,Wow thanks so much for this ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
apple,fpkcxez,t1_fpk88f7,1588692395.0,A battery replacement is thankfully a pretty inexpensive option through the Apple store. I just checked their site and it‚Äôs $49 for the new SE. 11 is $20 more than that. I also saw someone on here say they got an old battery replaced for only $30 somewhere.
apple,fpkcimu,t1_fpk5up3,1588692180.0,My 128gb was only $18 a month. The 64 would be like $16 a month
apple,fpkc8to,t1_fpjzyb6,1588692036.0,"67%?!? Sounds like someone is due for a battery replacement. My friends 7 is also probably almost 4 years old and not doing that great. I don‚Äôt think she realizes that you can get a cheap battery replacement. She doesn‚Äôt even seem to mind it though, she just charges it more often."
apple,fpkb9q0,t1_fpjytg8,1588691517.0,This is true because my pixel 3 has a much larger battery than my SE and the SE gives me like two extra hours of SOT. I got 4 hours on the pixel (only one year old) and around 6 on my new SE. It‚Äôs very efficient.
apple,fpkazn4,t1_fpjx985,1588691367.0,"My SE gives me around six hours of SOT so I can‚Äôt imagine it going degrading that much. My old iPhones never had issues like that and I‚Äôve used a 6 for two years and a 7+ after. I don‚Äôt even remember the 6 being that bad. Although I would get a battery replacement if that ever were to happen within only two years, not likely though."
apple,fpkaege,t1_fpk375i,1588691049.0,Mine is around six hours
iPhoneSE,fpjmkf8,t1_fpjm4ra,1588674103.0,Glad I could help :) also don‚Äôt forget to pick up a fast charger. They‚Äôre much better.
iPhoneSE,fpjlz1q,t1_fpjlva8,1588673500.0,It‚Äôs better than my pixel 3 that has a larger battery. I easily get around 6 hours of screen on time with it. The pixel only gave me 4 hours. I don‚Äôt use low power mode either and I keep the brightness on auto.
