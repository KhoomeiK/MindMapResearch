For me, I've been working really hard to build a life and reclaim what I lost for quite a while now. On the one hand I'm proud of myself, but on the other I'm bitter and resent how hard I have to work for simple things other people take for granted.

I'd love to hear what comments come out of this thread."

A big part of the equation for me is not having a support system and this means I end up overcompensating for daily tasks or not doing them at all. I've been trying to reclaim what I lost in childhood and build a life, all alone, and that in itself is exhausting. Add trauma and everything that comes with that to the mix, it's no wonder I'm always exhausted.

In case no one has told you this OP, you're doing a great job. You've been through a lot and you continue to be resilient. I wish you well."

What I do have trouble with is people taking me for granted or flaking on me for other people. I'll give you an example: I've been the initiator/organizer for one of my friend groups for a while. For various reasons I stopped initiating as much and we hardly do things as a group anymore. One person in the group used to always suggest things and say ""why don't you organize that?"". Why couldn't she? There's another person in the group who keeps putting out ideas now, and I'll reply ""Sure, sounds fun. Give me the details and I'll be there""...it never gets off the ground. And when I used to organize social things it was like pulling teeth to get responses. 

I've always been the person who gets bailed on when someone more ""interesting"" comes around in any given ""friendship"".

I just want a friend who cares enough about me to seek me out and not have a one-sided relationship.

There are lots of judgemental people in the world, but they're not always right. Letting toxic opinions in is corrosive to your well-being.
