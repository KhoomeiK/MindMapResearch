Anxiety,fnt38l4,t3_flvow6,1587233762.0,"I have had this for a year now and it all roots back to when i’m anxious, i dont have much of an appetite and when i’m not anxious everything is normal. i get in these cycles in my head wondering if it will ever get better, do i ever have a chance at getting rid of this cycle or is this just how i’m gonna live forever?"
