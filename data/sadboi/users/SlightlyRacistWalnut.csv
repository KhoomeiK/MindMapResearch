I had been struggling with peak levels of anxiety and depression before the quarantine hit, and just a few weeks before I had wished every day was like the weekend. Well I got my wish and it’s the greatest thing that could’ve possibly happened for my mental health. 

I haven’t felt this good in YEARS. Now my state is looking at reopening within a week or two, and after my boss checked in on me the other day to say they are starting to plan for bringing people back, I’ve already noticed a slight dip in my progress. After the first week of quarantine I wasn’t fatigued during the day at ALL, though granted I have been taking short mid day naps pretty much every day. Today I’ve been struggling to stay awake. It’s the first day in over a month that I felt fatigued outside of normal daily tiredness. I’m not ready for the world to return to “normal” yet, and now that I know I probably only have 2 weeks max left of my haven, my mood is starting to decline again."

AskReddit,foi7aao,t3_g7kdkj,1587780199.0,"I don’t blanket support the idea of Medicare for all, but if we could fix the fucked up cost of healthcare and get back to REASONABLE costs for services, I could get behind a basic level of “free” healthcare. 

The way our system works now it would be INCREDIBLY too expensive to fund Medicare for all, since the government would just pay current rates and it’s likely the cost of healthcare would rise even MORE if the government is footing the bill, like what happened when the fed loans came into the scene for university education.  

The health insurance industry, as crummy as it is, would also be in shambles if we introduced Medicare for all. I’m not mad the companies would go under, but that’s going to be thousands of people out of work. 

I’m a big supporter of direct primary care, where prices for services are clearly outlined and ridiculously cheap compared to the same service you’d get through health insurance (an X-Ray is $50 vs $250, etc). If we could work this model into hospitals and clinics across the country and make the prices of services reasonable, I would support our tax money going towards the program. We should still for sure have a private industry available though, because in many countries with “free” healthcare there are long wait times for surgeries and boards that basically determine if they are just going to let you die or not."

I watched a documentary about root canals on Netflix, and there actually can be some severe complications with them so I don’t actually entirely blame the mother on not wanting the root canal for her child (though her silver shit is totally stupid and not going to do anything).

As an adult, if I needed a root canal I would rather have them pull the tooth and get an implant, though I would see more than 1 dentist to make sure the tooth absolutely needs to go. We tend to trust dentists more than any other professional, when they can be wrong or scammy. 

Basically, if the dentist fails to fully extract all of the dead tissue from the tooth (which is virtually impossible to do), then a litany of chronic health issues, both physical and mental, can develop as a result.

Edit: so the dentist recommended antibiotics and the mother not giving them to her child I would consider child abuse, because he has a bad infection from a dead tooth and not giving him the correct medicine could kill him."

1. It makes it look like the virus wasn’t engineered by humans and purposefully released as a biological weapon, because who would infect their own citizens on purpose?

2. It helps solve issues relating to overpopulation. By targeting the elderly and the chronically ill, you are culling the heard to reduce the number of mouths to feed, but still maintaining most numbers of healthy children (the nations future) and younger adults (the nations fighting force). 

3. It provides the perfect cover to assassinate a few key members of political opposition/whistle blowers because of the general chaos going on. 

4. It destabilizes nations that could potentially provide an opening for some good old fashion global domination. 

The biggest “downside” would be the loss in production and manufacturing and the impact that would have on China’s economy. We rely too much on Chinese produced goods, and this could serve as a wake up call to nations that we shouldn’t rely too heavily on one source for product, especially for essentials like medicines.

I’m not saying the concept of the electoral college is bad, it evens out the rural vs city demographics, but the electoral delegates can cast a vote opposite of the winning candidate from their state if they so choose. I think a few states have passed legislation to prevent this, but it’s still largely true. 

There’s also the fact that voting itself is just a messy, unreliable system, like with numerous mail-in ballots getting “lost.”"
AskReddit,fk7tilb,t3_fgzg21,1583943338.0,"I work corporate for a Fortune 500 clothing/apparel brand. We are a global brand with many subsidiaries, so I can only speak for the US. 

Regular salary employees do have some paid sick leave, as well as the option to work from home. There are many “permalance” employees as well, who have zero benefits, but are able to take unpaid time off if they are ill. The ability to work from home as a “permalance” employee depends on your department. 

Our employee web portal is continually updating travel restrictions to the most impacted areas (China, Italy, South Korea, Japan, Seattle, etc). If you or someone you are in regular close contact has just been back from these areas, you are required to work from home for a period of 2 weeks. They requested you don’t come in if you have ANY flu like symptoms, but judging my the amount of coughing and nose blowing I hear throughout the day, people aren’t following that directive."

AskReddit,fk7mf86,t3_fgx2ek,1583939414.0,"We don’t need the government to pay for our current healthcare system, we need a new healthcare system altogether. 

Insurance companies have their hands too deep into Washington so the ridiculous cost of care has remained unchecked. Who do you think benefitted most by Obama’s mandate that everyone needs to purchase health insurance or face a federal fine? For me, a young, healthy single female, I would have to pay a monthly premium of around $200, on top of an $8,100 deductible before insurance gave me a dime. 

The solution isn’t have government pay current health care rates because the current rates are way over inflated. I’m not entirely opposed to a government run healthcare system if it’s not treated like the federal student loan program, where colleges raised costs and administration expenses exponentially because the government was giving money to anyone who applied. I don’t have high hopes for this system though, since government run systems are slow and inept more often than not (hello DMV). 

Right now there are a rising number of direct primary care physicians, and Walmart is opening low cost clinics for basic health services, like teeth cleaning and regular doctor visits. Both of these services offer clearly outlined and low cost healthcare without insurance. There are also surgery clinics opening that have standard pricing for procedures and don’t take insurance to keep their costs down. In a video I watch about it, employers in the area were covering the entire cost of procedures there because it was way cheaper overall than providing insurance coverage. 

THAT is the kind of system we need. The government footing the bill for the current system we have in place is a ridiculous concept.

The average price of an x-ray in the US is $260-$460. At my local direct primary care office the price of an x-ray is $40-$60. 

I’m all for government paid healthcare if an x-ray costs $40-60. I am 100% against government paid healthcare if an x-ray costs $260-$460."

AskReddit,fk3wy0c,t1_fk3m6by,1583848342.0,"As someone with a schizophrenic relative, I concur that the current treatments used to “cure” gender dysphoria are ineffective. Going through a full gender transition does not reduce the elevated suicide risk for people suffering with the condition. 

Going through a full gender reassignment to treat GD would be like catering to every whim of my paranoid schizophrenic relative so they finally feel safe. Spoiler: they will never feel safe, not even if we get them their Kevlar vest, put bars on all the windows, and install metal bars across all the doors like they’ve continually demanded. They won’t be happy no matter what security measures are put in place because it will never feel like enough. 

Granted, there are always exceptions to the rule since not everyone responds well to the same treatment method, but full on gender reassignment should be the last resort after all other methods of treatment are exhausted."
