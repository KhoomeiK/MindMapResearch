There are always people that care, even strangers, there are always people who will take you seriously and talk to you about this and try to help you. Go to your local police station even and just ask to talk to one of them, most of the police I've met that have been in it for several years have had a lot of experience both with helping people with these things and having to deal with this themselves.

AskReddit,fomqeuk,t3_g88ccd,1587900094.0,"I was house sitting for my dad for a week while he was out of town. He had a big mastiff and a smaller wiener dog, but they were both cowards, rarely ever made any noise. 

I'm almost asleep on the first night, it's about 2am, and the mastiff just loses his shit. I had put them in their kennels in the living room in the basement. It was the first time I'd ever heard him make a sound other than playful growling, it was an aggressive ""BROWWWWWWWWW"". i got out of bed and took my gun off the night stand and peaked out of the bedroom door and down the hall into the kitchen. About that time, the light over the sink started flickering wildly and I did a 180 back into the bedroom, locked the door, and sat up the rest of the night, gun in hand, listening to the dog.

Fast forward to about five days later, I come back from campus around 4pm, it's pouring rain. I had turned off my car (I don't know why) and got out to open the garage door. When I got back in to move my car, it wouldn't start. I called my mom to tell her I may need a new battery and I was on the phone with her as I went into the house. The rain sounded a lot louder in the house than outside, a loud echoing. I noticed hat the front door was locked, but unlatched, meaning the handle wouldn't turn but you could freely push the door open. I whispered to her that the front door was open and to keep talking and I went and got my gun off the nightstand again. 

Did a full sweep of the house while having a faux conversation with her, but never found anything, nothing was moved or missing either. I realised that my dad's stepson has come home to get his car keys at some point on the first day before I had gotten there and hadn't closed the door all the way. 

I had been alone, on the outskirts of the county, back to the woods, with the front door open for almost a week and had no idea. As for the lights flickering, I was told later on that the wiring that runs to the kitchen lights is the same as the wiring that goes to the living room lights and it'll flicker if it's on high. He also told me that he rarely leaves the dogs in the kennels at night because they get antsy. 

I've house sat for him again since then, but I've started checking all the doors twice a day and closing curtains and shades."

You could also call Weaver's customer service and talk to one of their sales reps, they're all pretty easy-going from my experiences with them. If you know what sort of things your friend makes, they should be able to give you some fairly spot on suggestions for what type of leather to get him

Edit: I will say that I personally love ""Crazy Horse"" leather. It's got a great color to it and it distresses and wears beautifully.
