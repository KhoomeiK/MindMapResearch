I always thought my Kitty Olivia was gonna love forever but she got sick when she was 15, I had her since she was a baby when I was 9. Found her outside and like you she has been there for me through the worst of times, was my best friend when no one else was there. There isn’t a time that I think about her and the love I shared with her and not cry. 
But animals come here for that reason. They come to give us/share that love and affection with us, they endure the struggle with us and move onto their next life.
I’m so sorry this is happening to you, but I promise you it’ll get easier.
Having another pet can help, although the love you have for your first mews will never go away.
I wish you and mews the best of luck <3"
Drugs,fl4krt3,t3_fjafe9,1584815652.0,"right before i went down a dark path of destruction i saw (in my minds eye) the path i was about to take, i saw my options too.

one road was dark, filled with death, despair, skulls, pain, and loneliness - the other road was like a tunnel that fades into whiteness.

i came to understand the latter road being a road of mystery, an unprecedented opportunity to take a step into the unknown, but obviously better option of sobriety.

of course i chose to use and it was an awful couple of years before i got sent to jail for a year and got sober.

not fun, i feel for you. you're 19 you're still young and can turn this around any time you want to.

there are plenty of resources that will help you stop using if you decide to take that route further down the road."

BUT, back when i I.V.'d the stimulant I could do a shot and then smoke some ganja for a very blissful euphoria and smooth energetic ride.   
I loved it, it's just very  difficult for me to estimate the correct dosages that make me feel good. Cuz there's been plenty of mishaps where I'd smoke marijuana after doing a shot of crystal and still get that shitty paranoia."

unpopularopinion,fdh3ncw,t3_ejvsef,1578414673.0,"Although I'm very late to this party, I do have some things to say.

I have a very high sex drive and am often the one who begs for sex. When my partner is looking at porn but not engaging in sex with me, yes of course I become upset.

I don't like porn due to the degradation and objectification of women, but I'm not saying I would consider it cheating if they watch.

I'd be down to watch it with my partner as long as I didn't feel threatened by the female and my partner didn't feel like I just wanted to watch it so I could get off thinking about Hunky Jose with the 11 inch shlong.

That being said, my partner has always been oddly secretive about porn EVEN when I said I had no problem with him watching it , as long as he was open about whether or not he looks at it. I don't know why he would feel the need to hide it from me when I'd told him in the past that I do on occasion.

Just because this is my opinion it doesn't mean I follow it all the time nor do I expect my partner to. It's just a preference to not need porn in a relationship.

As for the kink stuff I am open to everything, and unless my partner wants to watch some hot bimbo getting boinked in the anus then I don't understand the need.

I wouldn't expect him to jack off to pictures of me.. but that's another thing, he rarely Jack's off due to a low libido.

IDK I guess it all depends on the relationship, but you all are oddly defensive about porn. Care to explain why?"
relationship_advice,fcjsyq4,t3_ehkjn6,1577703131.0,"I agree with the other posters, it would be a problem for sure if he's ever done anything to break your trust.
Has he ever done anything that would make you worry about him going to a strip club with his friends, in spite of his affirmations?

In my personal opinion, I don't understand why a man in a relationship would go to a strip club to gawk at naked, attractive women who are dancing around him AND be drinking too.

Drinking + hot girls + no girlfriend in sight = possible mistake, if he doesn't control himself.

It's just all a matter of how drunk he gets and as long as he remains coherent enough to control himself and you trust him, you should be fine.

Like I said though, it's risky to be drinking in a sex filled/oriented environment when you're not single. That's a place for single people or couples..not men in relationships."

It's so odd too because with the heroin, he shoots and I smoke. But with the meths, I shoot it and he was only smoking it.

I've convinced him to stop so we will see, he's still catching them here and there.

Thank you so much for your response, this just backs up my argument for him to lay off the stuff a bit.
I don't use around him, but do still use. I am going to quit too though, unfortunately I experience the ""brain zaps"" when I withdrawal. Is there any way to mitigate that? It's really uncomfortable for me.

 This has been an eye opener for me though, I thank you so much!"

Stims,fa3uw07,t3_du56us,1575798043.0,"My(f 24) boyfriend (m 30) has been seeing these little flies (they're not there) and sometimes they fly into his eyes so he'll be scratching at them, not too badly to where there's scratches, but his eye will be left red. 
Lately he's begun ""eating"" the flies as they fly towards his eye, when I asked why he said that it was the only way he could combat them and stop them...even though he's obviously not stopping them.
I have a hard time understanding why this has happened to him as he hasn't been using anywhere near as long as I have, I've been using since I was 15 and have never had illogical hallucinations like his except once or twice.
How can I help him with his hallucinations? He won't go to a psychiatrist or a doctor, I've pleaded with him many times but he just doesn't listen..
How can I help him and be supportive?"
