minimalism,fouvwci,t3_g9mh8r,1588091271.0,"I struggled pretty similarly to your girlfriend a few years ago. I'll share my advice, though I don't know if it's helpful.

whatever money she doesn't need for bills, groceries and gas doesn't need to be in her bank account. whenever her account it exceeds what she needs to get through life (a budget helps) that excess money needs to immediately go into a savings account. a savings account which should not be touched unless her house burns down. boom, now shes spent the money. 

and with credit cards? try and remind her that she DOESNT have the money her credit cards are willing to let her use. that is not her money, that is the money someone is willing to LEND her. would she ask to borrow money from you to buy it? if not, it's probably not important.

additionally, deleting cards from Google/apple pay, her browser, and amazon/whatever will make it a lot harder to buy something on impulse. a few years ago I would see some dumb shit for $3 and go to check out only to realize I'd have to walk across my house and dig in my purse for my debit card. that small obstacle stopped so many stupid purchases.


MOST IMPORTANT COMMENTARY
Your girlfriend won't change unless she wants to. this is what changed me, but I don't know if it helps.

I came to a realization that in any REAL emergency I had no savings to fall back on. If my house caught on fire, if my cat needed surgery, if my car broke down, I didn't have anything i could rely upon. 

I had already come to this realization when I had to evacuate due to high tornado risk. I luckily had a bit of time, and I was driving to my parents much sturdier house and tornado shelter, so I thought hey, besides the essentials, I can grab a few things for safekeeping. just in case, ya know.

out of all the shit I've bought in my life, all the trinkets and crap for hobbies and cool vintage bags, I grabbed about four books and two small antiques from my grandparents. I had a backpack of essentials on my back, my cat carrier strap on my shoulder, and a small box of books and antiques, and nothing else id spent money on was actually that fucking important to me.

maybe have an ""unrelated"" emergency drill discussion. it's good to be prepared and know what you want to grab if you have to scramble. maybe you can remind her that most shit doesn't matter that much.

or, hell, maybe convince her that it's way cooler to flex experiences like going to the theatre or hiking on Instagram (and it is way fucking cooler lmao).

idk. I feel for you girlfriend. you can't force people to change, but I understand why you'd want to because I feel real fucking sorry for the girl I was a few years ago."
TMJ,fnjczxa,t3_g1sai1,1586996489.0,"God that all fucking sucks, I'm so sorry. I think it's really something to be proud of that you're in such a shitty situation and I'm sure hurting like hell but still fighting to get treated and to get insurance to pay up. 

I don't know if this is something unique to my family, but I've seen so many loved ones need treatment or insurance money and, because of their physical and mental pain, they often couldn't conjure the energy to aggressively self advocate the way our system forces us to. They would often... give up. Let problems get worse and worse. Accept the debt they didn't deserve. And I don't fault them for it, they weren't lazy, just suffering. But I hope you know that its strong of you to keep pushing, through your initial surgery and through this second injury and through the coronavirus closures and the insurance bastards. You should be very proud."

HerOneBag,fkx430p,t1_fksddrz,1584617997.0,"washing your laundry in a sink is super easy! search for tips in the r/heronebag search bar for tips, I'm lazy rn sorry lol. but being willing to handwash and air-dry clothes and underwear is what allows people on this sub to only carry one backpack for months on end! all you need is shampoo, something to stuff in a sink drain (a plastic shopping bag works in a pinch) and somewhere to hang the clothes! I have a ~10 dollar travel clothes line that I bring for convenience and most things I wash can dry overnight indoors.

I can't encourage quick handwashing enough! it's just so quick and easy and saves SO much space!

some really easy things to handwash and dry: socks, undies, bras, t shirts. worried things won't be dry by morning? fair worry! you can always test the air-dry time of clothes you want to bring before the trip! the key to good drying is to wring out all the water you can (but don't twist delicates!), then wrap in a towel and smoosh them, then hang up inside out (the inside being dry is the most important for sure!). 

also, this is nasty, but Darn Tough wool socks are a godsend. I just took two pair for a 12 day trip (in my defense it was supposed to be 6 days but... coronavirus). I was planning on being a nasty gremlin and wearing the socks twice between washes and turning them inside out overnight like the r/BuyItForLife people recommend if you must wear them more than once. But life got crazy, there is a pandemic, there was a family emergency, next thing I know I'm in Pittsburgh of all places and realize I've been putting on the same pair of socks for four days. Now, I know my own BO. I know when my deodorant starts failing, I know myself well enough to NEVER rewear underwear, and I can smell my running shoes from a mile away, but these magical fucking socks didn't smell like anything. It was insane. Later in the trip I got pissed off because I washed a pair, sat them in my general clothes pile once they dried, and then couldn't figure out which pair of socks was clean because neither smelled like anything. 

Anyways, they're more expensive than normal socks, but Darn Tough socks are worth their extensive hype, have a lifetime guarantee (they replace any socks that get holes)  and these weird fucking socks can save so much space by themselves. Also, if you're hiking, they are actually intended to be hiking socks I believe. But they really work for any weather or activity in which you'd like to wear a sock. only downside is that they take a little longer than overnight to dry, but what a small price to pay for magic!"

tifu,fkinj36,t1_fkichwi,1584224202.0,"sorry for unsolicited advice but I am also a lady with migraines! you may have already tried it but, if you aren't allergic to the ingredients, Excedrin migraine is crazy effective AND over the counter. Actually, I think Excedrin is temporarily discontinued bc the company realized they weren't measuring shit accurately, but it's just a combination of acetominophen (Tylenol), asprin, and caffeine. So really you can just take those things in combination! 

OR if you're willing to taste the nastiest thing ever, Goody's Powder is the same exact thing but in a powder you pour into your mouth and chase with liquid. it's fuckin nasty but I think I've developed a pavlovian response to it, like it works so well that I don't even mind the taste bc I know that relief will soon follow.

anyways, you may have tried this already or not want to try it, but I also stress slightly over how much pain medication I take and I generally find that taking Goody's Powder lets me take a smaller quantity of more efficient meds. I've also been prescribed multiple migraine medications and I STILL go back to this. Hope this helps, and if not, hope you don't mind the unsolicited advice!"

Pets,fivc9ki,t1_fivc5xa,1582757774.0,"••• additional tips:

-bring your car home on a friday and spend the weekend there watching your cat to see what needs cat proofed. are they scratching specific places? biting on wires (dangerous)! do you have plants they can make themselves sick from? do they sneeze at their litter? 

-if you for some (??) reason need to put your cat on a leash/restrain it for a moment DO NOT use the collar. cats have stupidly delicate lil necks. buy a correctly fitting harness, clip from there.

-weigh your cat to get the correct flea medicine dose. apply it at the back of their neck so that they CANNOT lick it. write the date you administer it on the box and do not readminister before 30 days have passed. do not use multiple flea treatments at once. 

-wash the food and water bowls every other day

-cats are so fucking wormy. just constantly. look up what worms look like in cats, keep an eye out, and then take your little bastard to the vet. worming is not expensive and may need repeated depending on type of worm. it is very important to treat the cat, and it isnt a big deal. And, if your cat lives in your apartment and never sees other animals, it probably won't get infected again!

-if your cat begins showing signs of separation anxiety it can be helpful to leave independent food sources for it to work on through the day, like puzzle toys you put a little bit of kibble in

-unless there's a specific need (...i spilled syrup on my cat yesterday) you dont really need to bathe cats.

-don't declaw your cat literally ever, its painful and can lead to litter box issues, aggression, and shorter lifespans

-look at the calories on your cat food. step on a scale, weigh yourself. pick up your cat, weigh yourself, subtract to learn the cat's weight. look up how many calories a cat of that size needs. feed only that amount. one of the best things you can do for a cat is keep it a healthy weight. if you adopt an overweight cat take it to the vet for recommendations on feeding, losing weight too fast is dangerous for cats.

-cat proofing: double sided tape and tin foil are cheap and effective deterrents. move any plants out of reach. dont let your cat eat anything that isnt cat food"
Pets,fivc5xa,t3_fa02hi,1582757724.0,"Wow I think you show a lot of the characteristics of a potentially great pet owner: you've made sure your apartment will allow it (though see if there is a pet fee or deposit!), you are confident you can give your pet enough attention, and you are thinking seriously about the financial responsibility!

I have worked at multiple animal rescues and here is a giant dump of things I would explain to potential adopters. It is a lot, sorry!

To answer your last question first: cat friendly apartments aren't very hard to find in America. In fact, many apartments will explicitly ONLY allow cats. There are some strictly ""no pet"" apartments but they are really uncommon. It is pretty common to have a pet deposit which can range anywhere from $50 to $250 dollars, but if its a deposit you will get that money back when you move out if your cat hasn't damaged the place. Less common is a pet fee, which is in the same price range but you DO NOT get it back upon move out.

Important to keep in mind though is that cats have long lives: anywhere from 13-20 years!! If your 20, you could still have this cat when you're 35, which is awesome, but also a good reason to be serious about it. If that is an intimidating time span then you should DEFINITELY consider fostering!!! You could have a cool cat friend to hang out with for weeks or months and the rescue can help cover any expenses and/or give you some of this shit free! Remember, though, that unless you tell them you want to foster-to-adopt they will still be accepting applications from other people to adopt the cat you're fostering. If you foster-to-adopt they wont let other people try and adopt the cat, and the cat gets to live with you for a sort of trial period to see how you both like it.

I'm going to give you a bare bones list of expenses and here is why: start off buying the minimum, save money, and IMMEDIATELY set aside at least $150 dollars for vet visits. Honestly, if the cat has any serious problems you will need more than that, but vets can often help with financing. And as time goes on, you can set aside a little more for your cat friend. 

A lot of these specific products are taken from  Wirecutter and nymag articles I'll list, but I trust them and have bought many of these items for my own cats. I'm on mobile but if i can edit later on my laptop I'll fix formatting:

•fleas: do a monthly flea treatment for a few months after bringing your cat home. only stop doing monthly flea treatments if NO other cats or dogs come in your house (if they do, be aware cats are not as eager to make animal friends as dogs). I only recommend advantage II, which is about $12 a month. 

•A litter box! Honestly, most litter boxes are fine, but I really like this one because my sweet bastard cat can't fling quite as much litter. $11/cat lifetime https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0087Y5NKS/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_awdb_t1_ebUvEb7MEXZX3

•Cat litter! We all gotta poop! Honestly for just one cat, one box/jug should easily last a month. Main thing is to always buy unscented, maybe low tracking if you notice little litter particles getting all over the place. Also, most people who complain about the scent dont scoop often enough!! Scoop that poop AT LEAST every other day and it will not be a gross affair. $12/month

•cat carrier: this is a weird thing to consider essential because you might not need it for months. I somehow ended up without a cat carrier a few months ago and didn't think about it until I woke up to a fucking TORNADO WARNING and had to evacuate my house immediately. I refused to leave my stinky bastard Jinx but all I could find was a 2x3 wire dog crate, which was massive, painful to tote, and left my cat thoroughly soaked and traumatized as I ran with her through a tornado! We were both fine, but I immediately bought this wirecutter recommended carrier. There are cheaper ones out there but she cant escape, i can shove her through the top flap if she is being difficult, the long strap means i can wear it, its TSA approved, and various, ugh, liquids come out of the comfy liner in the wash!

https://thewirecutter.com/out/link/23651/141961/4/77033?merchant=Amazon

•Food and Water bowls: for food you want something very shallow; cats don't like when their whiskers are constantly pressed while they eat. For water, get something that can hold a few days. Both NEED to be stainless steel! The bastards are sensitive and no matter how cute other bowls may be, stainless steel is the way to go. $20/cat lifetime
Wirecutter recommends these, which look perfect:
https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01DOP5L4M/?tag=thewire06-20&linkCode=xm2&ascsubtag=AwEAAAAAAAAAAVhk

https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PQX2ELE/?tag=thewire06-20&linkCode=xm2&ascsubtag=AwEAAAAAAAAAAVhl

•Food: whew. this is always a controversial topic. so, I'll say in general cats should eat wet food. cats have little natural thirst and wet food ensures they get moisture. kidney problems are extremely common in elderly cats and vets now link that to low moisture dry food diets. wet food IS more expensive. personally, I'm trying to save money rn so my cat eats wet food for about 2/3 of her calories, dry food for the other 1/3. 
Generally cats need a lot of protein, some fat, and very few carbohydrates. 
Here is a vet recommended cheap wet food that is easy to find at local stores.
https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0012KK47G/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_awdb_t1_mXUvEbAZV8GSR
If you did a can of that daily and supplemented with a decent quality cheap dry food (like purina cat chow naturals) you would be at less than $30/month. Also, with this kind of feeding, one bag of dry food would last ages.

this is a hard one to estimate. like, you can keep a cat alive with like $7 of dry food a month. But a really perfect cat food diet would be like $60/$70 a month. Most people should aim in between I believe. If only the people who can afford $70 a month in cat food adopted cats, there would be so, so many suffering and homeless cats. Do your best. Definitely aim to incorporate wet food though.

•Cat scratching post: It is vital to their nails and health that they scratch. Most like to scratch up the side of something, and when a cat doesn't like a scratching post its usually because it isn't tall enough. My tower is ancient, but this wirecutter rec is tall and sturdy:

If you have a table leg to spare my cat loves this from ikea:
https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/lurvig-scratching-mat-natural-30377794/

There's also little cardboard scratchers for a few bucks at pet stores. I'm going to say $40 initial investment, maybe $30 more every few months if you and your cat are struggling to find a solution

•A cat bed: at first just get a cheap one for like 15 bucks. I also sometimes just fold up small thin ikea blankets in random places and my cat enjoys to perch on them. When you have money and want to spoil your baby with more options, browse here: https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-cat-beds/
 $15/once (you'll probably buy more, but they arent necessary to keep fluffy butt alive)

•toys: there's a million good enrichment toys. If you're going the dirt cheap route (which you should at first to put aside vet money!) literally every cat enjoys chasing a shoelace. Many will play with them without you there to drag it around. Almost all cats love jumping in/hiding in/destroying cardboard boxes. For things to play with buy their self, look for things that move unpredictably (some linked below). I am ashamed at the amount of money I've spent on toys for my current cat Jinx and her favorite toys remain: shoelaces, boxes, scrunchies.

https://www.chewy.com/ethical-pet-wide-durable-heavy-gauge/dp/56209

https://www.chewy.com/jackson-galaxy-cat-dice-rubber-soft/dp/201653

•cat collar: even if the cat never goes outside, i really recommend you get a cat collar, specifically a breakaway collar, with your phone number on a tag. microchipping is  a good idea too (your rescue may provide for free or at a discounted price) but many people see a lost cat, assume its homeless, and just take it in without taking it to get microchipped. if your cat gets out (they're fast!) a collar makes it clear the cat already has a home.

migraine,fi6lop4,t3_f6hpwp,1582200260.0,"i know migraines vary by person but wow very opposite experience for me. i dont think naps have ever cause a migraine for me, and they usually help. for instance if i can feel one coming (the world looks like im watching a movie and my neck suddenly feels like i work in construction) then i can usually absolutely halt it by 1)taking a goody powder (powdered excedrin migraine) 2)getting rid of any scent/light in my room 3) laying my neck on an heating pad and 4) napping. like, that 30 minute nap can often stop what is usually a 12 hour migraine for me (i know, 12 hour is NOT that bad compared to many sufferers).

the problem with my ""method"" obviously is that life rarely allows me the luxury of being at home and going through this ritual. also, if i time that goody powder wrong the caffeine keeps me up. also also also if anything wakes me up from that nap the migraine proceeds to ruin my life for 12 hours.

Coffee,fi6l16q,t3_f6nrp7,1582199556.0,"i like having ""bad for you"" things with my coffee personally, but heres the thing: if you can buy a good quality of that thing, you will be more willing to eat a reasonable portion. when I'm having a moment at home I might have 1/5 of a dark chocolate bar i love. if im at a cafe i -always- want a croissant. sometimes ill grab these super thin italian waffle cookies to munch on while i have a cup.

these things arent ""healthy"" but because they are genuinely deeply flavorful and not just cheap/over sweetened filler food i slow down and savor them. and they cost a little bit more than my previous go-to snacks so that adds another motivation in my mind to make them last.

this may not answer your questions, and you may have health or lifestyle reasons to want to avoid even small portions of ""bad for you"" foods. this is understandable. 

my biggest over all advice is if youre actually sitting down with your coffee to pair a snack with it, savor it. take your bites slowly and think about the taste as you chew. try not to do other things during that time. a lot of the time i drink my coffee like im breathing, mindlessly gulping from my tumbler as i sprint through the day, and that is fine, but it has recently brought me a lot of joy to really mindfully savor the moments where i can just relax with a cup and a snack."

companies often dont show disabled people in the commercials because

1) as soon as a person with a relevant mobility issue sees what the product can do, they'll understand how it will help their daily life 

and 

2) as soon as the commercial implies that the device is FOR people with disabilities, everyone without one instantly tunes out. which is fair, people who dont need these products... dont need them. still, the company is going to make an extra buck where it can, so they are market towards the able bodied.

so like. i understand that if someone doesnt know that these products are designed specifically for people with mobility problems, yea, this seems like internet warriors being hypersensitive. but for people who are aware that these are start to finish designed for and used by the elderly/disabled all of the comments arguing ""but what do disabled people have to do with this"" are incredibly frustrating! like, they are the products whole point! and probably the products whole customer base! theres probably only three non-impaired people who have purchased this product and i promise all three of them live in a basement in florida. that means that when people make fun of the users they are unintentionally largely making fun of people who have bad hands and just want a damn egg.

i understand that some people weren't aware of this but i wont shut up about people with motor impairments because they are literally the -whole point-"
gatekeeping,fhxcv0n,t1_fhx8t3f,1581951303.0,"most of these products are genuinely intended for people with disabilities even if the commercial makes no mention of this. one of the reasons for this is that a personal with a disability who needs an egg cracker or the very infamous sock slider will, when they see the commercial, instantly know that it will benefit them. the commercial doesnt have to appeal directly to them, it knows that if they can afford a device that will greatly improve their daily life they'll get it. 

so, if they dont have to pitch to those with disabilities, then they can just pitch to those without disabilities and try and grab even more purchases. and an able bodied person doesnt want to buy a tool for the disabled, so commercial tries and makes the daily life scenario show that there is a need in everyones life for the product."

BipolarReddit,fhm7tbh,t3_f3tfii,1581709398.0,"ive had a very similar experience! im bipolar 2 and have been diagnosed with adhd for a few years. starting adderall last year changed my life! i feel very very lucky that it hasnt caused me ANY hypomania! it gives me the energy i need in depressive spells and the focus i need constantly!

i hope you dont mind if i share some things i wish i had known starting! you may have been on it for a bit but id like to leave this here in case someone else has only recently started it: 

1)eat before you take it or you will Never Eat

2)drink! so! much! water! it WILL dehydrate you very easily!

3)make sure you get enough sodium in your diet. same idea as point 2, adderall makes you pee more!

4a)most people get slight euphoria or Super Productivity when they start taking it. i have never been more productive than i was my first day on adderall. this will fade, dont keep trying to take more to feel that again. it should make you feel more energetic, more positive, and more capable of focusing; it shouldn't be giving you superpowers. remember that the goal is to be able to function at around the same level a normal person can function. 

4b)extra adderall doesnt make you extra get stuff done, it makes you unable to prioritize what you should get done

4c) you can still procrastinate with adderall in your system :( adderall helps me overcome 90% of my roadblocks with procrastination but sometimes my anxiety over the task/goal cant be medicated out. if you struggle with this, forgive yourself. it helped me to read ""Why You Procrastinate (It Has Nothing to Do With Self-Control)"" in the NYTimes

5)unless told otherwise, take a teeny bit everyday. especially if you struggle with depression, adderall withdrawal is awful. it feels so close to depression that i sometimes dont even realize ive forgotten a day or two of pills and am beginning withdrawal. it leaves me so exhausted i feel like ive climbed a mountain, and so sad that it feels like i climbed a mountain made of dead puppies. somedays you will want to have a lazy sunday and lounge around with your cat and you'll say ""ah i dont need any today"" and youll regret it. just take a teeny teeny nibble. you will still be able to lounge!

6) your doctor wont think youre an addict. your dr will know that some people gain tolerance very quickly. your dr will also know that everyone on the drug experiences withdrawals. be honest about how much you take and whats working for you. when i started i thought i was gaining tolerance stupid fast and should purposefully go through withdrawal or some shit to keep my tolerance down. my dr said to chill, most people will quit gaining tolerance within the safe range. he was right for me at least!

7) dont drink with adderall in your system. if you do drink, even when it isnt still in your system, you'll probably be a lot more of a lightweight than before. welcome the cheap drunk life. sip slowly.

8) go drink some damn water!

sorry this is so long! my afternoon dose really hit as i was reading your post! like you said,

9) adderall makes it hard to shut up!!!"

Pets,fhbkzce,t1_fhbbl5m,1581444424.0,"hi, i worked at a shelter and i just want to add some suggestions on talking to them:

if your photos and papers can show that this dog matches closely your dog, there is a good chance they will cooperate with you! i would NOT get the police involved unless they are being very, very obstinate. shelters are -generally- run by people who want dogs back with their family!

there is no shame in having to live out of your car!! however DO NOT mention that you were homeless for a period!! i wish i knew how to bold text on mobile so ill say again DO NOT MENTION YOUR HOMELESSNESS! im not saying this to shame you, but the biggest thing i can imagine going wrong is the shelter being obstinate because they deem you unfit/unstable. just tell them the truth: that the collar unexpectedly broke on a walk and he bolted. tell them that you searched extensively and that is how you tracked your dog to this shelter three hours away: you never gave up hope. they want to see that they are sending the dog to a good and stable home; do everything you can to present that image to them.

if your dog wasn't spayed or neutered the shelter may have gotten them fixed. most shelters wait until someone has paid the adoption fee, but some fix any animal after the waiting period (where they wait for an owner to claim the animal) is up. also ask for records for any vaccinations he may have received there. doggo prob just got the rabies vaccine, but knowing will save you some money next vet visit. 

additionally: dont be surprised if you have to pay a fee. this is the south so it likely wouldnt be super expensive. if they charge it, this fee is NOT an adoption fee. while your dog was there it cost the dog food, labor, and space that could have gone to another dog. 

i dont say this to guilt you: you did nothing wrong!! a collar breaking is unfortunate but it could happen to anyone, regardless of housing situation or wealth. don't blame yourself. and the shelter likely wont blame you either. we hear a lot of bad shelter stories in this sub, and they absolutely exist, but many shelters just want to hear happy endings. happy endings like someone reuniting with their dog after it managed to wander three hours away. 

i hope so badly it is your dog, and if it is, i hope that your pickup goes smoothly!! if it does, ill add that you can ask the shelter if they can microchip your doggie in house, and if so for how much. many shelters have subsidized microchips, so if they let you it will be much cheaper than having a vet do it! also, start pooch on a monthly flea treatment-- he'll probably have a few after the shelter.

sorry this is so long, i just really hope it all goes well!! i hope you update us!"

bestoflegaladvice,fffgzo8,t1_ffef51r,1579883755.0,"also worked at a shelter, i agree that this post screams of one of two things:
-Complete BS 
-Owner neglect

I say owner neglect bc the only reason even ""shit"" shelters behave like this in my experience is because they've been brought a severely neglected animal. The fact that a prescription cream has been applied to the dog and the owner is outraged severely rang warning bells for me. Why would a shelter was the resources of prescription medicine on a dog who didn't need it? And as an owner why would your first reaction not be ""oh my god is there something wrong with my dog's skin?"" 

On the spaying, I will say that if they feed around 4 or 5 (which they must to close at a reasonable time) then they would have had time for a 12 hour fast to take the dog to the vet in for spaying in the morning. And many shelters give the dog to the new owners the afternoon after spay/neuter so that after immediate danger has passed they can be more closely monitored/babied than a huge shelter would allow. Probably not best practices, but common practices.

But the biggest warning bell: THERE IS NOT A REPUTABLE ADOPTION AGENCY THAT WOULDNT SPAY/NEUTER BEFORE ADOPTING OUT. Any half decent rescue requires spay/neuter before the animal leaves the doors. Any decent breeder spays/neuters before they sell the animal. 

I would bet money that a lot of this story is either fake or grossly misrepresented. If any of this is true the shelter is being shady/shitty to the dog's owner, but, while there are exceptions, most shelters are only shitty to an animals owner if the owner is shitty to their animal."

veganuary,fdpvuat,t3_emkyi4,1578642608.0,"I didnt have to get permission, but my family has been VERY panicky every time i shift my diet to consume less and less animal products (getting soooo close to true veganism!). all thats worked for me is getting blood panels every six months proving to my parents that my iron and protein are fine (b12 is what i personally worry about more but most people think iron and protein are the biggest deficiency concerns). 

i actually get a pretty general blood panel twice a year due to other health concerns, and seeing proof that their sickly daughter isnt in fact withering away helps reassure my parents a lot. if youre in a position where your parents both worry about veganism + in a position where you have to have their approval, i would recommend showing them your plans for getting enough nutrients, taking a vegan multivitamin, and going to your dr for a check up + blood work. telling your doctor that you have radically changed diets and want to make sure it isnt causing bad health should be enough for most insurance to cover it. i will say that some doctors are against veganism, but all you really want from this is the paperwork with your bloodwork."
BipolarReddit,fal05lh,t1_fakts02,1576176072.0,"this. OP is saying they cant leave their husband because they rely on their husband's aid and require husband's their help. OP's unwillingness to take their medicine causes them to lash out at the husband they rely upon. It sounds like OP is essentially saying that regardless of how their behavior effects/hurts their husband its unfair of their husband to try and protect himself. 

But OP. You want your husband to stay with you and put up with your hurtful behavior because you need him. And while you've apologised for this behavior you've made no effort to change it/prevent it that you've told us about. theres for sure more going on than us reddit users can see, but this sounds so close to an abusive mindset to me. ive been trapped in relationships that hurt me in the past because he used his mental health problems as an excuse for hurting me and as a method of keeping me trapped (""you cant leave me i cant survive without you""). And I'm pretty sure I said a pretty close version of what your husband said: ""if you keep doing this, if you keep emotionally abusing me like this, if you won't work to change, I'm going to end up hating you."" 

As someone who now struggles with Bipolar and heavily relies on my loved ones, keeping someone in a relationship with me that they don't want / hurts them is one of my biggest fears. I'm so genuinely sorry OP. I'm sorry the latuda is awful, I'm sorry you don't have a doc right now, I'm sorry your husband is hurting you right now, and I'm sorry you're hurting your husband. Everything sucks. But expecting him to stay in a relationship that hurts him just because you need him is fucked. 

Don't wish for unconditional love; it's fucked up and you don't want it. Love should be conditional because you should both be working to treat the other well. Truly unconditional love would be staying with someone that hurts you, that hurts your loved ones, that kicks your cat and smashes your furniture. Outside of romance novels, a better phrase for unconditional love is Stockholm Syndrome.

I wish I had good advice after voicing my concerns. I guess as someone who has been on both sides of this sort of issue I would say that, if you're unwilling to separate, show him that you're making strides to get better. If you're absolutely unwilling to take your prescribed medication correctly then show him that you're doing your best to get in with a new doctor to discuss finding a medication that you will take reliably. Show him that you're willing to take it correctly more often, and make a chart for keeping up with it. None of this may be applicable, and I understand your situation is unique and I don't know everything. But from my perspective your husband needs to see some concrete proof that you're trying your hardest. I also think couples counseling is non negotiable. Your husband needs tools for addressing your problems that don't just hurt you and send you spiraling more.

I would also recommend trying to better connect with others in your life. If it ever comes to it and you two separate, having more people to rely upon and ask for help would be good. Even at the current time, having someone to discuss this issue with can probably help more than our anonymous asses can.

Gos bless you. It will get better. It really really always does. Stay strong.

Pets,f3b6pzz,t3_dg9s3f,1570803083.0,"This solution is kind of a lot, so let me preface this by saying I'm aware. One of my cats had some sudden aggression (no medical cause, confirmed by the vet). Our very elderly cat had moved out for two months and then moved back in. In that time Lucy apparently decided that the house was hers. 

It was a full fledged cat fight every time she saw Meep, our sweet old boy who was at the time very physically sick. Our home was pretty small, and Lucy had overcome aggression issues with very slow reintegration efforts before, so we weren't willing to put her up for adoption yet. (also she is an overall very... dramatic and awful cat and we were afraid other owners would put her outside. She's very dumb and would die immediately outside.)

(I promise I do love this cat.)

ANYWAYS you can skip all of the above: this is my idea for your dog 

Lucy, for about a month, was kept primarily in our bathroom. It was fully kitted out for a cat as best it could be: toys everywhere, climbing, feliway for stress. No expenses were spared, but excluding around an hour a day where we would keep her on a leash and let her try and reintegrate with Meep, she was cooped up in a bathroom. I felt awful and guilty. I cried constantly at this incredibly affectionate cat being kept in such a small space and with way less human interaction.

So I made a space for me. Every day when the showers were done for the day I'd dry out the tub, prop up my laptop, and throw in pillows and blankets. Lucy could come snuggle in my lap, we could play for a while with her toys. I made a space comfortable enough for me to spend hours in there with my baby. I'd study for classes and watch Netflix. 

This is to say maybe you can set him up a bathroom area. Or make room in a closet if he's somehow a jump risk in the bathroom. A laundry room could work if you have one. Clean it well, throw down what you need for leisure time or studying, and get your cuddles in with your baby without feeling awful. Maybe grab a bean bag for a few bucks at Walmart, throw in a toy and water bowl, and whenever you can spend time with your baby in there before crating them. Hell, if there's a big enough no jump space to have a baby gate in the doorway, make that their ""room"" instead of having a crate. If a pet has to be confined, I firmly believe the worst part for many is the lack of socialization.

Besides Lucy I've had to pull this with other animals throughout my life. Contagious cats. Unsociable/destructive fosters staying for less than a week. Old dogs with incontinence. 

I want to add that this might be a big undertaking and possibly one you can't make work at your current situation. Don't beat yourself up if so. Do what you can to make him happy, but it's very obvious that you love this animal and have given him a very loving life. Don't feel guilty for not having super reflexes, things like this happen all the time. My mom almost dropped an encyclopedia on my head once, and I was a human  infant. You mention rehabilitation, and it seems like it's working so don't dwell on him yeeting himself off the couch, focus on how he is improving. As you mentioned, we can't comment on his things like this effect his health but these are perfectly normal questions for a vet.
