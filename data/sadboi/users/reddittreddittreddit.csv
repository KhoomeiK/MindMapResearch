DoesAnybodyElse,foprs5t,t3_ftplgi,1587970040.0,"Hell nah, I only put it on for dialog heavy TV shows, like sitcoms, but the rest of my family acts like it’s the end of times, if I’m binging with then. I live in a noisy household, and even when i’m alone, I’d rather read what was supposed to be said, coming straight from the script, on a visual level, of for some reason it’s not audible at the time, than miss a line on the show, freak out on whether I just skipped a major plot point, and have to rewind and bear through 29-out-of-30 seconds I just watched over again. Plus, there are those few lines, where you notice an inconsistency between the subtitles and actual dialogue, like an actor improvised some of the lines, or differed from the source, and gave his own spin on it, that was actually funnier/more dramatic, than what was actually supposed to be said. Finding those moments or lines in a shows captioning is the closest thing to an Easter egg you can find on some streaming service, and in cases, I actually appreciate some actors and actresses’s style and technique more when you find out they represented their characters better than writers with years of experience."

A little while In, the episode kinda winded down, and it got pretty dull for a while. I was browsing on Reddit, and I came across this post, and your comment. I’ve heard my Alexa say stuff like “sorry, I couldn’t hear you” and whatnot, so I was kind of baffled that your Alexa would start playing a song, so I was going to reread your comment, trying to find what show/film you were talking about, so I could see if mine would to the same thing, but then all of a sudden, I heard Elenor say “Alexa” and something else, and Alexa started playing a song that I had never heard, just as I figured out that you were talking about the exact same part of the exact same episode of the exact same show I was just watching. I was flabbergasted, and it’s by far the weirdest coincidence I’ve ever experienced."

AskReddit,fawlr88,t3_e98jnm,1576372822.0,"When I was around 5/6 I owned this one app called iStunt (the OG iStunt, not the miniclip one). I’m 16 now, and I’ve bought and deleted many apps since then,  but this one in particular sticks out for two reasons. 
1: it was the first app bought on the first IPhone our family ever had, and It was honestly the greatest game (electronic or otherwise) I had ever played, and even now I’m still looking back on it with fondness. The app, had multiple levels, all unique in their own way, little to no microtransactions (a rarity, even a decade ago), and an array of ways to customize your your character and snowboard at the start of the game.

2: It’s theme. 

Mind you, I only started actually listening to the radio when I was around 4, and it was pretty much trash. Rihanna was one of the biggest names around, Brittany Spears dominated the airwaves, and anything pre-Macarena was basically ignored. The soundtrack to iStunt was my first taste of a track that wasn’t the generic top 40 sound I was used to hearing. Suffice to say, I was more than intrigued. 

About every 2-3 years, that theme gets stuck in my head, I usually don’t mind though, because it takes me back to a game where gravity is easily defied, where microtransactions aren’t to be expected, and when a nineties aesthetic fitting with a killer, oh-so-nostalgic sound behind it all could rock my world. The problem is, I simply can’t seem to find it. I’ve been trying to find the entire track and it’s artist on-and-off again for years now, and I only know of one video of the app that exists. Luckily, it’s got the theme in it. Unfortunately, it’s impossible to SoundHound, and looking up it’s lyrics get’s me nowhere. 

Here’s all I could find of the first iStunt: https://youtu.be/KxSO2gBIOgw"

AskReddit,f2n21ol,t1_f2hpo0v,1570310865.0,"IDK but either it actually used to happen, or I used to experience a weird amount (at least 100) of recurring dreams of specifically running to the edge of our carpeted stairs, and jumping realistically (I didn’t levitate or anything) at a near-horizontal level about 30-40 feet, at speeds which I would have expected to reach at that height, and landing on the ground, falling over, but surprisingly unscathed. Sometimes I would do this multiple times a day. I remembered that, at first, I was weary about what would happen if I acted on it. However, after 2-3 tries, I soon realized that no long-lasting pain would ever come out of my “stunt”. Of course, I would intentionally only do this at our house, explicitly when I was at home, alone. I still don’t know why my 3-4 yr old self didn’t try jumping off of other impossible heights,  but I’m sure glad I never did. I don’t know why this fluke of mine ever did occur, and I don’t know why that’s the only thing I really remember about those years, but there’s no way it could have been a dream, as there was really nothing out-of-place concerning those few moments, not counting my tendency of pissing off Isaac Newton just for sport."
