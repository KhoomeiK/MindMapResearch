AskMen,epz0f75,t1_epyyhab,1559655571.0,"When did I ever insinuate or imply negative talk about his father?

You’re saying I need to give up custody and parenting- because I am the mother?

His father is a convicted domestic abuser. He took his rage out on me and not our son, fortunately. But the stress of parenting was hugely triggering for him. After we divorced, his father decided that full time parenting wasn’t something he wanted to take on. There’s a reason that both of our lawyers, a family court judge, and a guardian ad litem all decided that primary physical custody was not something his father could handle. 

His father did not WANT any more than one weekend a month visitation with his son. And the occasional few weeks over the summer. 


You’re suggesting that my son should be placed somewhere where he is not wanted, rather than with his mother who wants to help him? OK, random internet stranger. Thanks for the advice. I’ll be sure to prioritize it."

I had actually deleted Facebook for my own mental health reasons but, it might be a good idea to open up a page just to get on marketplace or local community pages like that. My son is on his father’s tricare and unfortunately most of the psychologists who accept children in the area either dont take his ins or are booked till infinity- the one I got him into has actually seen him before, about a year and a half ago. I took him just to talk to someone after his father and I finished our divorce. He only went to 2 appointments and everything seemed to be going fine so we discontinued, I rescheduled with her when i called today. It was basically the quickest option, and she seemed to click with him last time we met"
AskMen,epy6aa3,t1_epy5xwm,1559620823.0,"Thank you. I think one of the aspects of my borderline personality is that I probably openly express my own negative feelings more often than I realize. And he may be adopting those behaviors or reacting to them. My family has always commented on how empathetic he is, and how eager he always seems to make me smile. I never yell at him, I’ve never physically disciplined him, so it never made sense that he would’ve felt like he needed to walk on eggshells around me but, maybe he has seen me get down on myself so many times that he‘s scared to make me upset? admittedly im sure he’s seen me cry more times than he should have. Its been a rough couple years but im trying to move forward. 

Thank you for being kind :)"

Parenting,epy2ro7,t1_epy1zep,1559617622.0,"He was tough on me, and he still is, but he also has a lot of integrity. He knows my parenting style and although he vehemently disagrees with it, and he chastises me for in private but he respects it. He’s one of those grandpas who is suddenly far kinder to his grandchild than he ever was to his daughter. 

There was one incident a little over a year ago, where he and I got into an argument completely unrelated to my kid. Anyway, yelled at me like he typically does. I know my son heard it, we had a family discussion, basically everyone laid into my dad. He never yelled at my son to begin with but he doesn’t raise his voice to anyone within earshot of my son anymore. 

And he really looks forward to his “pop pop/cleverskid” outtings- like when dad takes him to home depot or the monster truck ralley, etc. I don’t think he would be so enthusiastic about hanging out with his grandpa alone if he was treated poorly during their time together. Its the only time he ever seems comfortable doing “boy” stuff.?

Maybe he needs MORE time with grandpa? Idk"

AskMen,epxze32,t1_epxx57t,1559614953.0,"Im reading a lot of advice about disney- good to know! Honestly he’s more of a cartoon network kid when watching tv unless he’s watching endless sonic reruns on Demand. 

His primary media source has always been YouTube though, I had the parental controls enabled but I think he saw me type in my code one too many times because he got through them and started watching regular content on youtube.

He admitted it was because all the boys at school watch “five nights at freddys” and twisted versions of bendy & the ink machine, which made me uncomfortable as it is so when he asked for the game, I said no but I let him have the figurines he asked for on his birthday… And anything he wanted that was Freddy related was met with a hard “no”  

So that’s the crap he was watching on YouTube when he got past the parental controls.

That and a lot of cartoons disguised as appropriate cartoon parodies that end up being about Elsa murdering sonic and having dr eggman’s bastard child🙄


I am to blame for not checking his activity. Even though I had the controls on there, I should have double checked. If I had, I would’ve realize he went past the parental code weeks ago."
AskMen,epxys8c,t1_epxxzle,1559614480.0,"His primary complaint tonight was “i dont like the way i look” in the bathrub situation. Wouldn’t specify what about his body that he has an issue with and for the life of me I can’t see anything wrong with him. Not really sure what to say.

As far as the “bad person” etc I tried immediately reassuring him that he is a good person, that even good people make mistakes and that he should never think that about himself. We had a long talk about the fact that consequences for bad behavior doesnt mean i think hes “bad.” But that im doing my job as a mommy and i still love him. Hopefully that was impactful, I don’t know for sure"
Parenting,epxyk7h,t1_epxy22u,1559614309.0,"I edited my post to add, i did call the psychologist as soon as i could (this happened late friday past business hours, i was on the phone with them the minute they opened this morning and booked the first appointment available.) 

I would find another one sooner but the way his insurance works, it is referral only. It would take longer to get back into his primary care physician to get a referral to a different psychologist then it will be to just wait for the appointment with the one he’s already been referred to.

My issues didn’t start till i was a teen. But I know it happens for some kids much earlier. I want to get ahead of this before it gets worse :/"

AskMen,epxwp5t,t1_epxw0rp,1559612879.0,"OK. That stings but you’re probably right. I did try to get him into baseball, karate, but he balked and whined and I didn’t push it. 

I didn’t want to be one of those parents who force their kid into an activity that made them unhappy or whatever, maybe that was my mistake. I’m going to make him do some sort of extracurricular this summer and/or second grade. Maybe scouts, if he pitches too much of a fit about sports??

It’s expensive and money is tight but I’ll make it work if it means he has more self-esteem and friends. That’s worth it"

They basically bullied him out of the pack. And they don’t speak anymore. That probably bothered him more than he says:/

He goes with his dad for a few weeks this summer but when he gets back I fully intend on signing him up for a sport or scouts or music lessons of some kind- something. I have tried in the past and he said he didn’t want to but, I’m not gonna give him a choice this year.

notlikeothergirls,epxmmsc,t1_epwujvs,1559604931.0,"Exactly!!! I am an extremely strong swimmer, my mom grew up in California and was always by water. She had me in the water at 5mos. My dad was a Marine and we moved often but even when we lived in landlocked Ohio she still insisted on starting swim classes for my sister & i in kindergarten. Im glad she did because We got restationed to a coastal state a few years later and my sister & we were totally confident in the waves at the beach. 

I am following her footsteps with my son as well! 

I, however, have an irrational fear of the deep ocean and its inhabitants- particularly whales (stemming back from a traumatizing experience watching Pinocchio. Yes it’s ridiculous but even in adulthood, I cannot shake it.) 

I still go to the beach but I rarely get in the water unless it’s just to cool off. I dont go past my knees."

I want a quick fix like i had with the adderall but i cant get that without drugs & the patience is hard to come by.

And im dealing with those issues every day w professional help now which is good i guess but honestly the issue here today is more the hating on my sis so bad. Seeing her lose weight and be happy makes me so miserable because i thought id get that before she did. 

I shouldn’t feel this way about my own blood just because she’s happy. Whether i am or not. I feel like a terrible selfish person"

BPD,ep5p6sq,t1_ep39h1z,1559059146.0,"Yeah, this particular doc my mom sees is one of the few in my area who does therapy AND med management. I’m not that lucky, I see a psychiatrist on one part of town for med management and my dialectical behavioral therapist once a week on the other side of town haha. So maybe im just projecting my own irritation but.. i do get a weird feeling. I have straight up asked my mom, “how do you think it’s normal that your DOCTOR talks to you like a chitchatting friend and not like a therapist? Seems like you go to therapy to gossip about me and she just fuels the fire for you” 

 She has responded by basically rolling her eyes and saying that she has a very good repertoire with her therapist, and that she can say pretty much anything to her. Which, great. But I just feel like it’s incredibly unprofessional because for example, I got a particular doctor at one point and my mom told HER therapist... who in turn warned my mom that I was probably Dr. shopping, Because my new psych has a bad reputation etc etc. 

Granted, my psychiatrist at the time was on the news at one point for prescribing amphetamines to a kid who OD’d. And I’m an addict. So maybe the warning was necessary? But, I’m not HER patient. It all just seemed very tacky and gossipy. I mean I wonder if the other doctors in the area know how much shit talking she does to her patients? I don’t know.

There was also another time recently where my mom had accused me of using again, so the next day I took a drug test (lab setting, not at home- so I couldn’t have altered it even if I wanted to) and I pissed clean. But she was still suspicious.  She went to her therapist the next day and afterwords she came home, and she goes, “ you’re in luck, my therapist believes you. I’m not going to kick you out.”

Why the fuck does your THERAPIST have the deciding vote on whether or not im homeless, mom? Ive never MET the bitch!!

Grumblegrumble"
BPD,ep4phag,t1_ep4dtof,1559043779.0,"It’s possible. Its also possible that she cherry picks bits and phrases to validate whatever she WANTS to hear- 

Aka her therapist may have said: “its valid for you to FEEL like you should have kicked her out a long time ago for her issues”

And my mother hears: “you should have kicked her out a long time ago”

Thats just mommy dearest. But when I have specific issues going on in my life that she doesn’t feel I’m dealing with the “right” way, she goes to therapy and asks her therapist what I should do, then she always comes home with some sort of advice. 

Like “i told my therapist what happened between you & me and she thinks you need a different doctor because your meds arent working and she says the doctor youre seeing has a bad reputation in the local psych community”

It’s like I can’t tell whether she’s just making shit up to manipulate me or whether her therapist is really that unprofessional. Either way, it’s infuriating"
BPD,ep2n778,t1_ep2chro,1559010425.0,"Ugh.

My mother LOVES to come home after therapy to tell me all of the things that HER Therapist says about ME and my bpd/substance abuse/body dysmorphia. She speculates on all the diagnoses that I probably have. She’ll critique whatever my mom tells her (second hand) regarding my DBT therapist, etc. 

She’ll tell my mother that MY psychiatrist is wrong to prescribe X with Y.. again, even though I have NEVER MET THIS WOMAN.

if my mother tells it correctly, her laid back, cbt therapist likes to pretend she’s my dbt/med management therapist even though she’s never met me. It’s fucking infuriating

ETA: I just realized how “look at me!” I sound. 

The point I was trying to reach was that it’s not OK or professional for therapist to speculate on patients they’ve never met. I feel you there!"
