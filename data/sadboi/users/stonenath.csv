OCD,fqtto0l,t3_gkuo4k,1589645896.0,"Hello, I'm sorry that you have to go through all these.... I also had a hard time accepting I had OCD because my society severely discrimnates against mental illness. 

I took very long to come to terms and by that time, my symptoms has worsened to the point that I was forced to seek professional help. Seeing psychiatrists was really helpful because they gave me medication that I never knew I needed. The medication helped to dial down my thoughts a lot. 

 are you on medication?

 I know it's hard to accept.. but you are suffering now and you don't deserve to go through all these ... Medication for ocd really helped to reduce my suffering when I was in my teens.so please please consider going to visit a professional and getting some medication. 

Ocd is a chemical imbalance in your brain. You need to correct it or you will continue to suffer."
OCD,fqtsxdk,t3_gkvid5,1589645478.0,"I wish I wasn't alive... But once I have a nights sleep, it gets better the next day so I'm convinced to live another day... But yeah when ocd hits again, I wanna die again"
OCD,fqtsly1,t3_gkw7qg,1589645301.0,"Ideally... When the intrusive thought comes to your head, accept it is an intrusive thought and choose to let it ""go"" away from you. 

(E.g. like how you would deal with a naggy lecturer, let her words go in from one side of you ear and go out from the other.... Because you don't really think there's a point in listening.)"
OCD,fqtrwna,t3_gkwhhb,1589644911.0,"They seem real because the OCD side of your brain is telling you so, even if the thoughts are not real. 

Everyone has intrusive thoughts. The  difference is - OCD sufferers know these are intrusive thoughts but they can't stop thinking about if because of a chemical imbalance. 

An analogy would be a car going down a steep slope. A typical car has a braking system to stop the car from tumbling down. 

But ocd suffers don't have that braking system. 

They can only sit there sadly... and see the car tumble down the slope.

 See their thoughts run wild...

 in circles that they know don't make sense..  but don 't know how to get out of them otherwise."

OCD,fpop4ky,t1_fpooqix,1588788246.0,"Hmmm I think it's a little different..  because the individual doesn't actively seek out the thoughts or items which trigger the ocd rituals, unlike that in ERP..???"
OCD,fpohsp5,t3_geijbq,1588784729.0,"I was lucky. My mum was, by training, a doctor so she had some awareness. I didn't tell her. She told me when I was a kid. 

Meanwhile, my dad says insensitive stuff : "" just don't think about it. .... Don't think so much""  (honestly, do you think I wanted to lol)"
OCD,fpog7dl,t3_geklq6,1588783957.0,"Hello, I won't tell you  to stop researching because I know how hard it is to do so. But why not ... Postpone the research? Push it down your priority list for the day (since you know this compulsion is inherently irrational even though we can't help doing it). This is what worked for me, when  I had ocd thought compulsions: 

- when i first have the intrusive thought, I acknowledge it is an ocd thought and I am anxious about it. 
- Then I try to focus on other tasks.. even though I acknowledge that the thought is still running in some parts of my mind. (An analogy would be thinking of your brain as a CPU. You put the thought to research on hold, like  ""minimizing a program on computer"".)
- the rationale for doing so is that: intrusive thoughts come hand in hand with anxiety. By not acting on the intrusive thought and focusing my energy temporarily on something else, I am letting my anxiety levels subside. So that the next time I revisit my intrusive thought, I am calmer and more rational - allowing me to reduce the number of times I perform the ritualistic actions. (We perform rituals like checks, repeatedly,  because we are fueled by anxiety.)
- at the end of the day, if i have not forgotten the ocd thought and it's still a nagging thought at the back of my mind, i return and check it out.

OCD,fpoe7qz,t3_geljgg,1588783004.0,"Hello, I'm currently on sertraline (not sure if it's what you're looking for) for OCD. Here is how it worked for me if you're interested: 

- strong emotional blunting effect - I actually felt pretty depressed when I first started taking this drug because I felt very hollow. But I don't feel that way anymore (well most of the time) after I got used to it, and after I reduced the dose. 
- ocd intrusive thoughts have been reduced to a manageable level, to the extent where I can function and appear to be a normal person, in the eyes of my colleagues. 
- hmm if you're worried about sex drive, I don't think my sex drive has been reduced by this drug."
OCD,fpoc6yy,t1_fpoa02c,1588782018.0,"I think for now - maybe you can try to distract yourself by doing something more productive then see if the thoughts diminish or still stay there? 

Worrying continuously may be a sign of OCD... When my OCD was at its worst previously, I wasn't able to put a stop to my mental rituals (rationalising an intrusive thought, even though I know it's not logical) 

If the thoughts are still there, here are some coping techniques that have worked for me (if you are unable to see a psychiatrist due to the pandemic). They are listed in sequence below: 

- You can try to push the worry to the back of your mind first (I always think of it like ""minimizing a program"" on my computer), by focusing on something else . this lets your anxiety  revolving that subject matter cool  down.
- You can consider picking up a new hobby (haha e.g. knitting or building those mini Lego figurines). 
-  at the end of the day, if you really can't stand it, go back to researching again.. ( if you're aware it's not rational but still can't help it, it looks like a OCD ritual to me, based on my own experience as a OCD patient.) 

Again, pls double confirm with a psychiatrist when this pandemic thing is over / when ur govt allows u to visit hospitals."
OCD,fpo95oe,t3_gem65m,1588780533.0,"How long do you spend worrying about - whether you have OCD? And are the thoughts repetitive? 

Have you lost productivity because of these thoughts or is it really because there's nothing much to do at home (like me) that you start thinking?"
SuicideWatch,fpo4xpg,t3_fzu0jt,1588778443.0,"Hey there, don't be so quick to jump to the conclusion. 

--- 
Fear that you may be a pedophile and continuously rationalising it continuously is clearly an intrusive thought. You need to be aware that it is an intrusive thought and you are not your intrusive thoughts. 

Take a step back away from your intrusive thought, let your anxiety subside by distracting yourself with something else. 

I know there are people saying that we shouldn't believe our intrusive thoughts. But as a fellow ocd sufferer, I understand that we are constantly doubting ourselves and it is difficult not to judge and conclude. Just do that when you are in a better state of mind, when your anxiety has fallen. 

Then try to look at the issue objectively from the perspective of an outsider. (E.g. 1. This person has intrusive thought A.  2. This person felt XYZ and performed action ABC. 3. So if I were to judge this person, what conclusion would I make, based on the facts of the case?) 

On a side note, I strongly recommend not to stop taking medication. I've been there , done that - trust me, it only makes the intrusive thoughts and anxiety harder to handle. (In fact, I had a relapse  previously.)

---
Anyway, back to the main topic - If you still conclude you are a pedophile after doing the above, it's okay, so long as you don't hurt any humans. 

Be aware that you don't choose your sexuality and you didn't choose to be that way. So long as you don't act upon your desires (if any in this aspect), you haven't done anything wrong and you are still a good person."
