Keep in mind that what’s important is to choose a gun that is good for you and your playstyle even if it isn’t a “meta” gun or considered bad. 


1. Mastiff

2. R-99

3.  Wingman 

4. Prowler w/ hop up

5. R-301

I didn’t list care package weapons (Kraber, Peacekeeper, Devotion) because these guns are OP by design.  You should pick one up if you find it.

Edit: Use whatever gun that is comfortable for you but still practice using the current meta weapons like the Wingman.  I personally use it occasionally because my aim isn’t top notch.  I’m better with the Flatline.  I know it’s objectively worse than all the guns I listed but I get kills with it.   That’s the important thing.  

I still practice using the Wingman in the firing range and hopefully I can get gud with it one day."

Simply put, you had plenty of cover to use to avoid taking damage while dealing damage.  Since you were pushing by yourself, which isn’t the idea, you want to mix aggression with smart play.  

Play around cover.  Constantly change your angle of attack. Use your canisters to create choke points or to separate the enemies from their team.  

Lastly, don’t get bloodthirsty.  I do this too.  You did an excellent job with the first enemy.  You quickly downed him.  If you would’ve disengaged and healed after throwing canisters around the downed enemy you may have clutched it out.

If their victims are also black and on the lower socioeconomic rung of the ladder or addicts or otherwise outside of ‘normal’ society, then the police couldn’t or maybe wouldn’t be able to connect the murders to any one person and they may be dismissed as random killings or drug or gang related.

Celebs,fp2wqeg,t1_fp0m0we,1588269164.0,She’s also in a fairly recent sci-if Netflix movie.  The movie isn’t that great but it’s there.
datingoverthirty,fp2tves,t1_fp1cq0i,1588267798.0,"Yep, and the worst part about it, at least in my opinion, is that it will have you questioning yourself after too long.  It’s really easy to let someone slowly break down your boundaries defining how you let others treat you if you’re not careful."
datingoverthirty,fp2tlp0,t1_fp0lfcn,1588267670.0,"This was done to me by close family.  On top of it all, it was justified by me being told that I was just “too sensitive” and how I need to man up.  Needless to say, I’m 43 and still deal with the repercussions of this type of treatment although I’ve learned how to maintain boundaries, not take unnecessary shit from people, and to avoid people like this like they have the plague. 

Simply put, reading this made me white hot mad because it isn’t funny at all."
datingoverthirty,foyxbg2,t1_foy979h,1588180915.0,"Yep, this is a glaring warning sign of potentially even more abusive behavior down the road.  Even if it doesn’t, this alone is really toxic and abusive behavior on it’s one.  It’s not edgy or cool or him being a bad boy.  It’s not cool."
AskReddit,fory25e,t3_g8ygxs,1588020513.0,"Almost any OTC drug has a store brand equivalent that’s way cheaper.  It’s the exact same thing, in almost every case.  Acetaminophen is acetaminophen, aka Tylenol.  I almost never by brand name OTC medicine.  You’re just paying for a brand name. 

Also, the Dollar Tree has most of the equivalent medicines for just $1.   If you’ve never been, you’ll be surprised at their selection."
apexuniversity,forwnbo,t1_for22zs,1588019809.0,"Yep.  Awareness is a big part of this.  Are you keeping track of where your cover is and not just laser focused on your enemies?   Are you trying to constantly changing your shooting angles?  Also, are you engaging at the proper distance for your weapons/sights?  

All of these things help to mitigate the dilemma of having to worry about having an empty clip in a close gun fight."
apexuniversity,forw75p,t3_g93utn,1588019582.0,"One way to avoid this too is to try to be more efficient with your ammo. In other words, don’t just spray and pray.  I do this sometimes just outta pure panic but try to not empty your entire clip in one go unless you know you can hit all your shots with that clip. 

One way to get easy kills is to poke fire at someone, let them empty their clip while you’re behind cover and then punish them if they reload in the open.  

Always try to fight behind cover. I know it’s not always possible but try to use it as a rule of thumb. That way, even if you have to reload or switch weapons, you won’t take so much damage.  

One of the best pieces of advice i learned on this sub is to, above all else, limit the damage you take while fighting."
apexuniversity,fokt6fx,t1_fok6bcl,1587848471.0,"It’s the Peacekeeper of SMG’s if you ignore how good it is hip firing even without the hop up.  Your aim has to be slightly better than average using it as a burst weapon but if you can hit your shots, it’s relatively easy to knock someone using a few bursts even at mid range."
Alabama,fokbk4c,t1_fok50uv,1587839000.0,You also bring up another important point.  You can’t open up the state of workers aren’t on board and y’all don’t like you can work without putting yourselves and family in unnecessary peril.
Alabama,fokbdvp,t1_fok04qr,1587838909.0,The really simple solution to testing is to make it available to anyone who *wants to be tested. This includes antibody testing.
Alabama,fokb7in,t1_fojuw0y,1587838815.0,"Obviously, we can’t continue to social distance indefinitely.  You’re right that we have to try to go back to whatever is the new normal at some point but we aren’t even close to being over the jump or however you choose to phrase the fact that we have no idea who’s infected and we have no way to protect workers from possible infection and disease as a result of the virus.  

Also, considering how so many people lack healthcare because we didn’t expand Medicaid, you actually want these workers in places like bowling alleys, barbershops and the like to put their lives on the line?  For what?"
ApexConsole,fok85w4,t1_foj8l94,1587837193.0,They do have some of the best voice lines of any Legend. I don’t play Bloodhound that much but even their thank you lines are cool. Lol
ApexConsole,fok801d,t3_g7kltv,1587837106.0,"As someone who plays Gibby a lot, this is the time to let the enemy team fully commit to rushing you, then you throw your ult right on top of everyone and go out in a blaze of glory.  Ha, ha bruddahs!"
datingoverthirty,fo1jj2q,t3_g514gp,1587434657.0,"The larger question you raise about not being in a good enough place to date is one I constantly struggle with.  I mean, I get it that a lot of people don’t want to date someone who doesn’t have their proverbial shit together but, as another redditor pointed out, human connection and contact is something we all crave. 

In my opinion, as long as you are completely honest about your situation then go for it.  Just be careful about people who want to rush in and save you or people who think you’re desperate and will take anything and anyone because of your circumstances.  

I think any and everyone deserves to connect with our fellow humans even if you are dealing with struggles of your own.  

Lastly, understand everyone has the right to their own preferences.  It’s nothing wrong with someone swiping right simply because they want someone who has their house in order."
ApexConsole,fo06lgq,t3_g4ulev,1587406982.0,"I got my marksman badge with the Longbow.  Don’t get me wrong, the Sentinel is just plain fun to use but I can fire two shots in a few seconds with a Longbow and cause as much damage or more as with the Sentinel.  

Also, the Longbow and Tripletake can be used hip firing or at medium distance in a pinch.  We all know how good the Tripletake is in this role.  The overall slow speed to do everything with the Sentinel makes it nearly impossible to use this way unless you’re facing another player that’s either AFK or is standing almost completely still."
ApexConsole,fo05tpk,t3_g4ulwu,1587406598.0,"If you’re talking about fun and satisfying, then it’s the amped Sentinel. 

If you’re talking about everything else, the Longbow is it.  

I love using the Sentinel.  The sound and lever action reload is so cool but the molasses-slow Fire rate, ADS speed and weapon switch time puts it in the category of a weapon like the Spitfire, to me.  Both are fun to use but have huge weaknesses.  I’ll usually switch to another weapon late game."
serialpodcast,fn80iau,t1_fn7v014,1586731363.0,I agree.
serialpodcast,fn80hej,t1_fn7fyo0,1586731348.0,"To me, that sounds like it’s plausible. Even using the Justice Department’s number, that’s concerning enough to seek ways to lower it.  We could never achieve zero in either direction, in terms of guilty getting off or innocence being convicted just because we are all imperfect humans.  Also, we should realize that the, assuming the numbers are reasonably accurate, that the 9% - 12% are disproportionately people of color."
serialpodcast,fn7r2vm,t3_g000wx,1586725916.0,"Two things can be true at the same time.  

Adnam was guilty and his story was told in a dishonest way to push an agenda. 

There are innocent people in jails and prisons.  Who knows what an accurate number would look like?  It’s unlikely that it’s a majority or a plurality but it’s enough that we should be concerned about it. Racial disparities in our criminal justice system contribute to this."

Alabama,fmtmwx0,t1_fmsf3mb,1586375480.0,"It’s worse than them trying to prove their premise is correct.  Small government types actually create a self fulfilling prophecy but purposeful underfunding and understaffing agencies that are in place to help us with things that we can’t handle as individuals.  

Also, this isn’t about battling political ideas but about doing dumb shit that’s actually hurting people."
Alabama,fmtmk95,t1_fmsgg7m,1586375306.0,"This is why so called limited government is built on a false premise.  The entire point of organizing ourselves into communities and neighborhoods and cities, etc is so that we pool our resources so we can handle things that we can’t accomplish individually.  

It’s kinda the price we pay for living in a wealthy and relatively safe society.   

Can we finally admit that when Reagan said that government is the problem, he was full of shit?"
Alabama,fmtm47i,t3_fx53hq,1586375086.0,Yeah...but isn’t the entire point of a municipality to serve the interests of the people in the city?   Why even have a city if it’s not about the citizens of that city?

apexlegends,fmt5ouc,t1_fmogdyd,1586367272.0,"I can kill it in the firing range with the Wingman.  The problem is when I add my movements and the enemy’s movement to the equation.  

The gun is extremely powerful but I usually drop it for something with a more reliable TTK."
