bipolar,fbcq7py,t1_fbc7dpa,1576730440.0,"So do you think music repeating in your head is caused by bipolar? This happens to me too, usually the same song lyric for like a day or two and at night, but I really never thought it was because of bipolar."
bipolar,fbcq2my,t3_ecitzy,1576730323.0,"I’ve never seen visually what it looks like in my head. This really hits home though. I know I’m not a “bad person”, but at times my brain feels like it’s being pulled in so many directions. My mania tends to make me seek adrenaline so it manifests in anger and agitation. I also have pretty shitty internal dialogue at times too. It’s like I know the best version of myself who I can be, and am, but the nasty parts of my brain like to trick me into thinking I’m alone and not worth anything to anyone. It’s pretty hard sometimes to not listen to it, but we’re all trying our best and will get through it."

Justfuckmyshitup,f1vz26p,t1_f1rfy4a,1569777965.0,My first concert was Aaron Carter too! He was with S Club Seven and Dream Street I believe. What a sad mess. Didn’t he recently go on Dr. Phil and was getting his tattoos removed??
Dermatology,f1vxz0i,t3_dao0t1,1569777529.0,"I literally wouldn’t put anything on it until the rash clears up. I have an entire sleeve and many other tattoos and only put a&d on it for the first 2 days and basically dry heal it. It’s an open wound, it needs oxygen and the more moisture you’re adding to it, the bigger the risk for infection. You probably put too much ointment or lotion or whatever you’re using on it. Just let it dry out for a few days, it’s not gonna ruin the tattoo. Clean it a few times a day with plain soap, let it air dry or use a clean paper towel to dry it. Once it gets cleared up I would just put like plain lubriderm lotion but a thin layer, it should never be gooped on."

I’m feeling like I’m in a stable place which is something I haven’t felt for a long time. Also, my new job is super positive and all of my coworkers are great. 😊 little things, but they mean something to me."

Huel,evec1zj,t3_cjbwmv,1564462092.0,"Tried it for a month, missed solid food too much, have an extra bag I haven’t touched. I noticed boredom in the first week. I added berries and almond milk and blended it for a better taste. The shaker isn’t the best so I’d suggest using a blender to make it or definitely follow the directions of adding some to water, shaking it, then adding the rest of the huel and water. I didn’t notice any difference in weight, but it is quite filling!"

I really didn’t mean for it to take away the seriousness of the accusations and I think it’s great people are coming forward and getting rid of this creep.

My boyfriends a healthy as can be rock though, I don’t know how he does it but he takes life as it comes and does it with flying colors. One day we’ll be there!!"

AskWomen,epj3xrt,t3_buql76,1559246812.0,"I’m working on improving my self discipline, which means making a daily effort to eat healthy, get some sort of exercise, meditate, and go to bed at a normal hour. I am also working on controlling my impulses, so I am trying to be more kind, not nitpick the ones I love, and have a positive outlook cause I tend to lean towards the negative. I hope to move out within the next 6 months to a year and be a better version of myself. Baby steps count more than you would think."
