Jin was one of my favorite characters to bring to life this month. Her color scheme, pose, outfit, all of it came together beautifully to make such a wonderful card.

I've been working on a couple of variations of backings for these cards as I hope to, in the future, have printable works to showcase. I want to thank the [r/dnd](https://www.reddit.com/r/dnd/) community for all the nice comments I received on the last comic I posted. This community's positivity is what fuels me to keep doing awesome work like this. You're all the best!

""With her golden dragon mask and katana, Jin fearlessly slashes through her problems. Her training as a monk has made her a wise opponent in combat. She's one who uses her dextrous body to outsmart her foes, cornering them, and dispatching them with a graceful flourish.""

Jin was one of my favorite characters to bring to life this month. Her color scheme, pose, outfit, all of it came together beautifully to make such a wonderful card.

I've been working on a couple of variations of backings for these cards as I hope to, in the future, have printable works to showcase. I want to thank the r/dnd community for all the nice comments I received on the last comic I posted. This community's positivity is what fuels me to keep doing awesome work like this. You're all the best!"
