ptsd,fphyq4u,t3_gddt0n,1588630294.0,"I identify with this for sure but it’s jealousy and shame for me. One example of how it manifests for me is with service dogs. I struggle seeing trauma service dogs in public because in my mind it’s like wearing a giant sign that says I’m damaged or I have secrets I’m not allowed to tell. I have a service dog, but I only use him at home though he’s capable of public ventures. It’s so sad that I have this amazing tool to make my life more manageable but I won’t allow myself to use him because I’d feel too exposed. I want it all secret, but that’s how trauma thrives isn’t it? In the dark. Maybe it’s time to find small ways to illuminate just a corner or something.

I’ve known people like that who’ve tried that with me and they do sincerely think they are helping but for me it does the opposite. I’m sorry your dad doesn’t know how to help but I do think there may be love behind his actions but that doesn’t make them less hurtful. 

That’s what it sounds like you need right now is someone to say “I’m so sorry you’re hurting. To think of death tells me your pain is intense. How can I help support you right now?” I’m sorry your dad didn’t know how to do that. I truly hope you have some other allies in your life who can stick with you while you fight this. People say stupid things about how and why you should live and I’m sorry for that and I think it’s ok for you to gently let them know what’s helpful and what isn’t. That helps them help you. If they can’t seem to get it, I’d strongly encourage the hotlines and chat lines. Right now there is a lot of extra mental health support out there so why not give it a go? Just know you aren’t alone and you can keep coming here and we’ll try not to say stupid things that just hurt you more. Remember you aren’t alone. Take care!"

I imagine this all feels a bit surreal but also painfully real. 

I really hope you can practice self care and get yourself a good meal. Now is a time to take good care. Maybe even better care than normal.

Telling someone something bad about themselves is one thing, but when you couple it with action especially that which comes along with torture porn, it’s no longer just a verbal message. It transforms into very real very visceral programming. I don’t just hear the message, I feel it in my body. I know it in my bones. It sounds like you know something about that too. 

What’s helped me so far is starting to teach myself new messages. I’ve learned how that kind of programming happens like the tactics they use and in a way it clears the smoke and mirrors. I can see the man behind the curtain and all of a sudden it’s less scary and intimidating. It’s just some asshole who doesn’t have the power I thought he did and he certainly doesn’t get to determine my worth. Admittedly, I’m still working on this but I know I’m getting somewhere steadily. Maybe if I keep at it, I’ll stop being an object and start being a person. I want to be free and I’d like you to get the same for what it’s worth."

As much as you thought you were a part of those decisions to do what you did, with that kinda of porn, I highly doubt your voice carried the weight you thought. 

You were perpetrated.  That’s not a reflection of you or your worth or what you deserve. If anything, knowing this about you tells me you deserve more than most- LOVE, RESPECT, and DIGNITY."

I hate how dirty I feel knowing it’s out there and people get off to it but it wasn’t who you are. It isn’t your personhood. Please try not to tell yourself you were lost with those videos.

But then there’s the others. Singletons don’t realize how confusing it can be to have split desires and intentions. Everything feels like herding cats and trying to get a consensus is near impossible. 

I feel hypocritical offering this as I’m struggling right now too but I guess I feel more vested in you and your system surviving than I do myself. Things that can help: journaling to tease how who is saying what and to find those voices wanting to live, stuffed animals or pets for comfort, mindless tv or a go to movie or show, writing affirmations, remembering that the internal push to die shifts with the parts- my system changes their perspective often because they act like indecisive children (bc they are), and lastly the biggest for us is support from friends or our therapist. I tend to pull back during these times so it requires purposefully doing the opposite of what I want.

They couldn’t produce anything. It’s all based on the chance that I’ll do something they have no evidence that I’ll do. 

Their argument, while I’m sure is illegal, is based on their duty to ensure the safety of the supervisee. I guess I’ve looked at this like I have the burden to prove I’m not dangerous but maybe they have the burden to prove I am. I don’t know.

DID,faozkxp,t3_ea83ur,1576276233.0,"Our therapist and the docs at a DID hospital had to help us through one interject and it’s been helpful with others in our system. They use the analogy that the interject part is just wearing a big scary suit that looks like and sounds like our perpetrator (also military). They said under the suit was a scared little child as interjects are often some of the youngest and first created parts to keep us obedient to old rules that at the time served us immensely, but are now quite destructive. 

With therapy and actually doing a little ceremony like a funeral for the scary suit, we had convinced the young child to peak out and relinquish his need for such a suit. He truly was just a scared kid...though before I was like “off with his head!”  Sounds like you have a better grip on your situation than I did. I don’t know if your system works like mine but so far everyone inside I thought was there to hurt me were really just protectors or scared kids in disguise. It was just a matter of cutting through the defenses and creating the safety for them to let go of the unnecessary smoke and mirrors to reveal who they really are. I have to admit it felt like dealing with the most terrifying temper tantrum ever because he said and did things I truly struggled to manage, but I had the supports in place to hang in there and I hope you do as well.

DID,f1oe6rg,t1_f1lqem9,1569642388.0,Sounds like you went through quite the ordeal. The co conscious time has been pretty disturbing. Normally it doesn’t feel this scary but while all the switches are happening so fast it adds an element of something really unsettling. I’m going to try to sleep off some of this and see where we land.  Thank you for the feedback.
DID,f1odv9a,t1_f1ly832,1569642088.0,"Reddit has been amazing. And clearly sleep is important based on all everyone said. I had been getting sleep but I don’t think I was getting enough for what was happening in my system. I just didn’t realize it until I received your feedback. Thanks, friend!"
DID,f1odq0n,t1_f1n0q5s,1569641954.0,There’s definitely a lot going on in our system. This divorce is tearing our heart out but I think there is a consensus among the responses I got that sleep is integral to recovery. I took my night meds and plan to sleep until I can’t tomorrow. Thank you for your insight and hope I can get off this ride soon.

None of that abuse is an appropriate reaction to discovering his wife’s substance misuse. The substance use is a coping skill, a maladaptive one, but one nonetheless. The substance use isn’t your fault but it is your responsibility so that you can learn to cope in healthier ways and be the amazing mom I highly suspect you are.  But remember what I said. Abuse is not ok. Abuse is not your fault. Abuse is abuse. 

Thank you for being so brave as to post."

therapy,eys9f3y,t3_cvh5ze,1567391008.0,"I just wanted to add another angle. One time I was in a hospital in Maryland and their laws required reporting regardless of how long it’s been and how old the survivors are. They reported. So my answer is it depends on the state laws where you are but mostly I’d say if you are an adult and no one under 18 or over 65 is currently at risk, then it’s probably not covered by mandated reporting."
