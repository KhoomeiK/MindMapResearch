Anxiety,fpq0942,t3_gelkhi,1588812596.0,Yes : ( it’s the worst.
Anxiety,fp6xyeq,t3_gbcpep,1588360541.0,i try to remind myself i can’t change it and i have no control over how someone perceives me so let it go and stop obsessing over what i said. easier said then done i know. also reminding myself that people have their own worries and busy life that takes up most of their brain space and they most likely are not thinking about anything i said helps.

TheLastAirbender,flwlrey,t3_frciqc,1585555489.0,got me tearing up over here. so lovely.
Washington,flkzrsj,t1_flk56f9,1585250888.0,my husband was denied on his first application but got approved a few days later. the phone lines would not let you wait for a live person and the online application didn’t have options for his situation (not laid off but no scheduled hours for the foreseeable future.) he got a denied letter then an approved letter about 2 days later and saw the funds deposited finally today which after taxes is a disappointing amount but at least it’s something. hoping your wife will get approved soon i know it’s so stressful. we have to try to not get the virus and not fall behind on bills while losing our livelihoods - it’s a lot right now.
Anxiety,fksycy2,t3_fkayil,1584501353.0,yes! this virus outbreak is my nightmare come true and my anxiety has been the worst it’s been in years. then i stress about stress weakening my immune system and it just goes round and round.

AsianBeauty,favaoq7,t1_fau3xsh,1576357137.0,Second this. Tamanu oil is amazing! I use it to seal my moisturizer at night and on my eyebrows. It’s helped my eyebrows grow so full. It has antibacterial properties to help with active acne and anti inflammatory  to help with post acne spots/scars.

Botchedsurgeries,eucihfz,t3_cfiih0,1563676062.0,yes! saw this today and was shocked at the obvious unevenness. i’m sure her poor son has had to hear comments from classmates. her before and after made my jaw drop!
SimsMobile,eu3pdhp,t1_eu3kk4n,1563421146.0,good to know-thanks!
SimsMobile,eu30yf9,t3_cejqd1,1563402712.0,noticed a few things went up. i was debating buying another room or unlocking a new career location i chose career and then the room price doubled now. i was bummed :(
childfree,eov3jn6,t3_bt8wdn,1558887852.0,i always just say “he’s not good with kids” and walk on really fast/sometimes legit run away with my beagle. not worth the risk of something happening and truly he doesn’t like kids haha! how rude of her! you did nothing wrong. she shouldn’t even want her kid running up to pet random dogs it could be dangerous. my dog is very protective and reactive to strangers who get too close and not cool with randos trying to pet him.
SimsMobile,eof8j9c,t3_brm1ue,1558526792.0,i’ve come so close to finishing the last few quests and missed it by like 2. i’m over it! this plus the llama zoom and the tight timelines and super long events (7-8 hours) is making me not want to play anymore.
