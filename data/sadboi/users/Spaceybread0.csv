SuicideWatch,fpcmv8f,t3_gcnb5m,1588506412.0,"Jeez, I don't think I properly understand what you go through, but I am currently in a similar state, I'm a 15 year old guy with OCD, BPD, and Social Anxiety. I have struggled with these things pretty much throughout my life. I can't assure you that things will be better, because chances are, things may not get better, and I learnt it the hard way. I've spent my fair share amount of time in the washroom with a knife, contemplating release from the this toxic society, just wanting to get out, and I have left scars on my hand every time I thought about it. 

I still managed to come out of the washroom, even if I was crying, or hurt, or just completely broken, thinking, man, not right now, I need to do something, just something worthwhile. Hence, every time I left a scar, I wrote a little essay, or drew something and just in the hopes to show it to someone, I lived another night. This may seem naive or rather stupid but to me, it isn't, because without it, I would have been dead last year. 

I know how you might think you're different from everyone else around you, taking cringed selfies, but take my case, I don't even use any other form of social media, so whenever people around me talk about some stupid new trend, I'm lost and feel more like an outcast, but I've tried to find happiness in it. It isn't easy, and I still feel really bad alone, but I've just tried to come to terms with it. Sometimes being a lone wolf means that you get to be your own alpha. 

I still have days where I feel like just ... leaving, and I weep and sit in a corner alone, feeling like this is it, it's too much and I can't handle it, but just trying to live off another day, in hopes that I do have just another happy day. In all honesty, the only thing that keeps me driving right now is the hope, the sheer hope that I get another happy day. 

I, um, kinda cried while writing this, but I hope this helps you. Take care. <3"

Try to be friends with the guy who you think is a few steps ahead of you, find a common interest and send online messages to him. You'll automatically become close to all of his friends. I personally find it really hard to talk to people and hence I always sent text messages to someone I was scared to talk to. Once you become good friends with the guy, you can also converse with the girl. It should be easier but will take time and patience. I found myself in a similar position last year (I didn't have a crush at the time, I was just trying to make friends in a school) and the dude who I talked to became my best friend and the girl become one of the few people who I talked to in class.
