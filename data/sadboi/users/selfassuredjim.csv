Please, do not let my, or anyone else‚Äôs opinion shape who you are. You know who you are, you know best the why and the how of your choices and outcomes you achieve.

We can acknowledge others opinions without making them our own.

Do you want to be ‚Äògood‚Äô? Do you actively choose to do ‚Äògood‚Äô?

I really just want to say, love and accept yourself. I make mistakes all the time, and seek to learn from them. That doesn‚Äôt make me good or bad, just means I am trying, and sometimes that is exactly what is needed."
