BPD,fopgfwy,t1_fompd52,1587960842.0,Thank you for sharing this. The societal pressure to succeed within specific social constructs is mind numbing. I also feel a huge weight lifted for the time being now that the national/global focus has shifted.
BPD,fopfk3g,t1_foo722p,1587960201.0,Not to butt in but I am a mom of four boys one of which was recently diagnosed with high functioning autism. A lot of what you described were symptoms that he was displaying before we sought out an evaluation. I'm new to reddit and am not sure if link sharing is okay but this article was very helpful when I was deciding to have my son evaluated.
