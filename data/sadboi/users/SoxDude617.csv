SuicideWatch,fb98vm8,t1_fb984tk,1576632377.0,Height only matters to shallow fucked up people. I believe you'll get respect and a relationship some day. 14 years isnt really a long time or enough life experience to make a permanent decision.
SuicideWatch,fb97n12,t1_fb8l2x3,1576631455.0,"You don't want to yet, but have you ever gone on a road trip? Smoked some weed? Had sex? There are things you're going to want to do eventually. Do some of that first and if you feel the same way in 4 years when you're 18, I'll push you off the roof myself. 
I'm all for supporting people in their own choices, but you're seriously really young. You could miss something amazing. At least give life a few years as an adult. Please."
SuicideWatch,fb8ktca,t3_ebyih9,1576616072.0,You're a teen? Wait a few years. Experience life screwing you as an adult first. You can always jump off the roof later. But there are a lot of experiences you'll miss out on by never turning 18.
