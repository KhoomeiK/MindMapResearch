Something is going on with your dad. I say this as someone who is divorced from my kids mom and has struggled with mental health problems and has had a lot of insecurity about being a father. I also say this as someone who has a good relationship with my dad, but communication is WORK with him.

If I had to guess, this looks like kind of a perfect storm. It sounds like there is some insecurity about his role as your father, and it seems like there may be some mental disorder that affects impulsivity, and that would also explain the paranoia. It also sounds like he has some self esteem issues, which would make his going back to an abusive ex make sense after something really shook him. This man is in pain.

You‚Äôre probably right about the ex, but bringing it up in that context is just going to drive him away.

changemyview,fq0kzq1,t1_fq0ilcg,1589033619.0,"That is a good point, and I hope you understand that the bottom part of my post was directed at that sentiment on the internet and not at you.

I‚Äôm trying to remember my impressions to that scene when I first saw it. I wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs ‚Äújarring‚Äù, but I can see it being a little clunky. That whole third act has so much going on, and overall it was pretty smooth, but I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre wrong that it‚Äôs a break in pace.

I also think it‚Äôs a good point I you‚Äôre making when you bring up The Ozarks, that women characters can be strong without explicitly saying so. And maybe the way to look at the scene in question is that the MCU could‚Äôve done a better job throughout to get that across instead of scenes like this and a stand-alone female lead superhero movie being the 21st in the series- and that movie being largely a bridge from IW. Maybe these scenes are pandering. You could also say that the strong female leads (Black Widow, Wanda, Gamora, etc) get a little lost in their movies. BW was definitely a well-fleshed out character that was feminine but also independently strong, but she‚Äôs not getting an Infinity Saga movie, and a lot of her scenes are her in a support role. Despite killing Papa Ultron, Wanda‚Äôs role in the first half of Civil War is awfully close to Damsel in Distress.

Pandering or empowerment? Probably depends on the person and probably some of both, and there‚Äôs no objective truth with art.

Anyway, can I do a reverse delta? Œî

Edit: I guess I can‚Äôt delta you. However, the Bechdal test just came to mind, check it out. I don‚Äôt know how much a lot of the infinity saga would pass. Is there a strong female lead besides CM or Nebula that isn‚Äôt also a romantic partner (BW with Bruce, Wanda with Vision, Gamora with Starlord)?"
changemyview,fq0h6ih,t1_fq0e3rt,1589031812.0,"I just rewatched it too because it was going to bother me. Beat me to it!

The other thing you‚Äôll notice is the women are running a hell of a lot of interference before Marvel starts her run. She took down Sanctuary II, correct, but she also caught them unawares and an entire army focused on you is another story. Wanda and Valkyrie fuck the shit out of those big things, etc. Could she have won by herself? Maybe. Everyone is undefeated until they lose, and as they are planning CM2, presumably they will find a way to give her stakes.

Not to pile on, but I think the real question that a lot of people are really asking when they say this is ‚Äúwell isn‚Äôt this just virtue-signaling fan service?‚Äù My answer to that is, so what? CM is certainly not one of the better MCU films, but it is meaningful to a lot of women and girls, and I don‚Äôt think there is anything wrong with that. My wife was horrendously bullied and abused growing up. It was very important and empowering to her to see someone get told repeatedly ‚Äúyou aren‚Äôt strong enough, you‚Äôre weak‚Äù, and then to watch her get up again. She doesn‚Äôt think it was a great movie, and her favorite character has always been Tony. It‚Äôs not a great movie but it‚Äôs an important one.

The answer to ‚Äúwhy did Character X do Action Y?‚Äù is always ‚Äúfor the sake of the story‚Äù, and the answer to ‚Äúdid they put this in there for the sake of inclusivity?‚Äù is ‚ÄúYeah, so what?‚Äù"
