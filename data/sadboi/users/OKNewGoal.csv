DnD,exhy911,t1_exh15t7,1566316941.0,"My dad runs his own business so therapy isn't an option right now and my family knew that a while back I was really depressed, they think I just got better. They have no clue that the first month of that recovery was because I didn't think I would be around much later."
DnD,exh09ur,t1_exge9xb,1566284175.0,I turned 17 two months ago and logically I know things will probably get better but sometimes you can't see it the light when you are in the hole.
StopSelfHarm,ewjyaw5,t1_ewhk5kp,1565473923.0,Thanks for the advice
StopSelfHarm,etne5rb,t1_etkrcpw,1562984501.0,"Thanks, I honestly had no plans on telling her I l literally just said I was making bad decisions and she just started trying to comfort me. To be fair I think she has had her suspicions, this friend has been in psych twice. It is almost ironic, I have invited a friend or two two calm peaceful places before with the plan to tell them and I've always chickened out but she finds out while I'm just complaining. I hope that you feel better soon as well, it always feels hard no matter how far you are on your road to recovery."
StopSelfHarm,et46mr6,t1_et0i1k2,1562444971.0,"I get that and they would respect that but it would definitely seem strange if they asked about them and I said I didn't want to talk about, I don't want them to know about them let alone what they are from."
StopSelfHarm,eszjdk5,t1_esz4ebf,1562363043.0,"Thanks, that is my main fear is them knowing. I think I'm going to go and just wear my long pants, if they see them the hiking excuse might work. Though, right now while I'm in a mentally good place it might be best they do see them and they know. I know that when I'm in a low spot I will hate that option but they have been very supportive with my not eating problem."
StopSelfHarm,esz3m0j,t1_esz33ty,1562354560.0,"Thanks for the advice, I want to go but I know if they knew how bad things really were they would tell my parents and while I love my parents they don't get depression and self harm. I think I am going to go but then the big question is an I going to lie to my friends about the scratches or just never wear a bathing suit or shorts and neither of those options sound great."
StopSelfHarm,esz2mat,t3_c9juw8,1562354049.0,"I have a camping trip coming up with my friends, I have been very excited about it and it would look weird if I mysteriously cancelled. Only problem was I thought I could stay clean from self harm long enough that I would be fine, obviously I couldn't do it. One of my friends is 45 credits into his degree that deals with things like this and the other one is a recovered self harmer, they used a blade though. I use a safety pin to self harm. I'm worried it will look weird if I don't wear shorts or go swimming but I'm also worried they will see my scratches and know exactly what they are. These people are very close friends and have helped me a lot with my eating problems but I don't feel ready to have the discussion of self harm with them yet. Any advice is welcome."
StopSelfHarm,esdz0c3,t1_esdyn4y,1561873935.0,Thank you I feel better now I mean I only feel better because I slashed up my legs but one step at a time
StopSelfHarm,esdxojy,t1_esdfyqo,1561872429.0,No our old insurance didn't support that and my dad is now trying to start his own business so I can't go
StopSelfHarm,erwfe5r,t1_eruny5l,1561341995.0,"Thank you for offering an ear. Good luck with sticking with your recovery, it's sometimes way to easy to deal back into old habits."
StopSelfHarm,erwfb1k,t1_erutl8c,1561341923.0,"I think I'm going to have to do that do that, it's only the first day and I still only are half a meal. Thank you for the advice, I'm going to stick with this goal for the week then probably go back to daily goals."
