survivinginfidelity,fqxwu03,t3_gl9jfu,1589739062.0,"I healed. The only thing that truly heals the devastation of having your SO deceive and cheat on you is time and new positive experiences. 

It also helped me personally to reprogram myself about how I viewed infidelity. The pain at the time and the drop in my self-esteem was so intense that I eventually began to wonder WHY we as humans are culturally programmed to suffer so much due to some other person's lapse of judgement. 

I began to wonder WHY people in some cultures are ready to jump off a bridge at the discovery of their SO's infidelity, while people in other cultures don't sweat it at all. It's as if they sort of accept it as just a part of human nature. 

I began to read books written by anthropologists and other doctors who study human behavior, sexual selection, etc. What all this did for me was it made infidelity less personal to me. 

I stopped fixating on MY perceived flaws and on my SO's unforgivable failures, and began to better understand how ""sexual strategies"" in humans are really not much different than those in other animals. 

You simply stop taking the infraction so personal, and it helps you to move forward and to be more forgiving towards others' mistakes. 

The net result: you are happier, more confident, and less paranoid moving forward with others. And you stop wasting the short life you have on this earth consumed with anger."
vegan,fqxol2b,t3_gl8sx8,1589735508.0,"Even hard core meat eaters know deep inside that the system that allows them to continue to eat meat is cruel, psychopathic and immoral. A single video of footage inside a slaughterhouse verifies this; exposes the horror that they themselves cannot rationalize if confronted with it. So farming states outlaw people taking photos in and around slaughterhouses.

People don't like to see themselves, nor their traditional lifestyles, as being immoral. The entire culture is set up to help them to hide the torture and murder behind what sits on their plate.

Pigs are called ""pork"" and ""bacon""  rather than pig flesh, so they can separate the pig from what they are eating. Same thing with substituting ""beef"" for cow flesh.

People who are vegan generate a level of uncomfortableness in meat eaters, because vegans have confronted this immoral reality (that meat eaters don't want to be reminded of) and have changed their lives accordingly, to not contribute to this immorality.

So they attack vegans whose very existence simply reminds them that their diets are immoral."

SocialDemocracy,fqqp9px,t1_fqqeogz,1589569507.0,"I suspect our difference in opinion lies in our respective goals. Your goal seems to be an intellectual one. To normalize a label to the point that it is no longer a word that creates reactionary responses. America's brand of laissez faire Capitalism has failed dramatically, and so you want the world to understand this. Don't get me wrong, I do too. But our country needs serious reform more than the intellectuals need a slam dunk. Fascism waits at our door as things have gotten so bad.

My main goal is about one thing: getting progressive policies passed despite the existence of a hight-turnout baby boomer generation that spent much of their lives fearing communism and socialism and basically anything that their elders brainwashed them into believing was evil. The Democratic establishment capitalizes on this fear by hanging the very labels that candidates and the younger generation support around their necks. 

That BB generation is not going to be converted. Period. The younger generations don't need to have ""socialism"" normalized, because they never feared it to begin with.

The baby boomers are largely in support of Medicare For All and many of Bernie's policies. Yet, they bizarrely see him as an extremist. There is a disconnect between their support for his policies and their fear of ""what he stands for."" It's the Label. 

FDR was a social Democrat who used much of the same rhetoric that Bernie uses today. But he steered clear of labels. He won so many elections they had to create term limits. Bernie calls himself a democratic socialist and he has lost two back-to-back primaries.

AOC,fqi8qzm,t1_fqi54tj,1589392460.0,"Because you are playing chess with the deep pocketed health insurance industry who bribes all of our chess pieces to throw the game in their favor.

The health insurance industry has always paid way more in fees to doctors than they need to (which they just pass down to policy holders in the form of higher premiums, deductibles, and copays).

This has been effective in ensuring that many doctors' offices won't accept Medicaid and Medicare patients, because ""they don't pay enough."" 

My father's longtime doctor joined a large doctor's group that states they won't accept Medicare patients unless they pay the practice an additional $5,000 per year. 

This is becoming common practice as doctors are, more and more, working as employees for large doctor companies.

Most doctors offices will NOT even accept Medicaid patients. In Oregon they often agree to accept a token number of Medicaid patients. Most Medicaid patients call doctors offices after doctors offices desperate to get one that will actually accept them.

This makes for-profit health insurance necessary if you hope to keep your doctor, or to even find a doctor's office that will accept you. And this ""pricing the government plans out"" strategy also ensures for-profit health insurance policies remain unaffordable.

This is by design. It is how the health insurance industry makes doctors unwitting co-conspirators, and lends to the narrative, ""government healthcare sucks!""  

A public option will just be a speed bump in the way of the for-profit health insurance industry. To get Blue Dog Democrat support for a public option ( Blue Dogs are paid off by health insurance industry) they will necessitate weak coverage, higher premiums, and turn this into a crappy policy offering. The same way they did with Obamacare. 

Obamacare was a hail-mary attempt to save for-profit health insurance and it failed miserably. It's time we crawled out of our caves, and joined the rest of the industrialized world.

oregon,fq0zv04,t1_fq0vyhs,1589039817.0,"Business owners don't hire more people because they get a tax cut. They just enjoy more profits for themselves.

Business owners hire more people ONLY when the demand for their products and services increases to the point that they can no longer produce enough products to meet the new demand without hiring more people. 

EXAMPLE: Suppose I own a business that makes food products, and we are adequately staffed to meet the demand, and I, as the owner, make $1,000,000 a year on $5,000,000 in revenues. 

Trump gives me a tax cut and I now take home $1,150,000 a year.  The demand for my product remains at $5,000,000 in sales. My tax cut didn't change the demand for my product. Wealthy people who got the tax cuts can only purchase so much food.

I am still adequately staffed to do $5,000,000 a year. I have NO interest in hiring another employee, just because I have new found money. 

However, if instead of giving me a tax cut, they gave $2,000 to every American, I suddenly see a higher demand for my product as low income people who ration how much food they buy, begin to bring home more groceries. I therefore have to hire more people.

Economics 101."

Portland,fpt4x68,t1_fpsyibf,1588884923.0,"Your point is well taken. 

If my comments created confusion, that is because the tax itself is confusing. Instead of simply saying that those above the federal poverty level (who incidentally are ACTUALLY living in poverty) must file and pay this tax, it says those who make $1,000 or more must file this tax. Then it says you may ASK for exemption if you earned less than the federal poverty level.

But my point stands that this tax is shamefully regressive and requires poor people to have to pay it. 

It also requires people earning $1,000 (probably homeless, or close to it) to have to file a tax return and ask for exemption, or else face debt collectors -- which is pretty cruel in my opinion."

Bernie has the right to be on every ballot and to have a say on the Democratic Party Platform based on his delegate wins. If the DNC tries to steal that from him, progressive sentiment will change.

Don't be so certain that your dementia-riddled, sexual harasser of a candidate is going to stay where he is in the polls. He has been hiding his gaffe-prone ass from public scrutiny and the general election hasn't even begun yet. 

Wait til those he sexually harassed start getting coverage, and he starts getting more TV coverage. He will need progressives more than ever. 

Oh, and by the way, he has made NO concessions on healthcare. Lowering the age requirement from 65 to 60 is 10 fewer years than Hillary offered (50). His concession on the bankruptcy laws is simply to undo a law which he PERSONALLY championed at the request of his Wall Street masters."
