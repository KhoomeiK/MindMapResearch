My mother was the biggest piece of shit in the world, to where I (a 23 year old female) began to look at other maternal figures in my life as if they’re all like her..they’re not. Please don’t let one bad person in your life make you feel that way about all women- not only is that not healthy for you but it’s gonna make it really hard to have relationships. Just because your mother has hurt you doesn’t mean everyone will. Hate is just a coping mechanism which is so unhealthy. Trust me."
raisedbynarcissists,fqn8l73,t3_gjv0ky,1589490503.0,"I’m 23 and had the same kind of mother. I haven’t spoken to her in years, neither has her parents whom I currently live with or any other relatives yet that doesn’t stop her from reaching out to every family member who wants nothing to do with her...she thinks we’re the problem when really, it’s her. Anyway, the word for this is abusive. It’s good that you’re aware enough that you know you’re being gaslighted...don’t ever let her try to tell you you’re not. I don’t know how easy it would be to cut her out of your life since you’re close with your dad, but there’s no need to have that around you or your kids. Hang in there 🤍"
instagramvsreality,foe3nm0,t3_fsaur9,1587695377.0,This is so so sad and just one of the many reasons that social media is toxic. The original is adorable...she looks like a naturally gorgeous woman in her 20s and then the edited ones make her face all sunken and her eyes pop outta her head. :/
raisedbynarcissists,fod8lhb,t3_g6wh6d,1587681633.0,"That is 100% absolutely NOT okay. Any of it. The fact that you are questioning whether it was abuse or not is enough right there because you know something was wrong with all of that. Do not blame yourself or say you’re being dramatic because you’re not. You have every reason to feel upset, uncomfortable and that boundaries were crossed. A normal parent doesn’t act that way toward their child. The fact that some of these things occurred more than once shows right there that it most likely wasn’t an accident. If it wasn’t intended that way, maybe he’s mentally ill...I don’t know but still there is no excuse for making your own daughter feel that uncomfortable. I’m a 23 year old girl and had a very abusive upbringing...I don’t really know what I can do or say to help but please know that your feelings are valid and you’re not being dramatic at all. I’m so sorry you had to go through all of that."

I don’t know if I’m in denial about kratom or what (I go through about an ounce every 3 days) and I don’t mean any disrespect when I say this but how did this drastic of a change happen just from kratom??

I’ve noticed that even though I’m fairly socially withdrawn in general, this quarantine has been making me nitpick every part of my brain to where I can’t get out of my own head. I feel on the brink of insanity. I’ve relapsed on my addiction (not much but still did it), I was rejected for the millionth time by an abusive ex who for some reason I kept running back to. Honestly just a complete mess. I’ve been so inside my head that I’m destroying myself at this point. I guess I’m telling you all this to hopefully help you and others reading this that you’re not alone. This is a trying time that’s putting a lot of us to the test more than regular folks.

BPD,fmnrg87,t3_fw78zp,1586233223.0,"I was in a relationship from age 18-20 with a guy I lived with the whole time and loved very much. It was a fairly healthy relationship...I was just way too young to be pretty much playing house with someone. Anyway, I went through extreme grief when he left me. To the point that I felt like someone close to me died. It felt like hell. Anyway, I’m not proud of it but I probably slept with 20 different people in the following months. I had so many random ass guys coming in my place that my roommate pretty much said she wasn’t comfortable with me bringing a bunch of strangers in. I was also overdosing daily on my benzo scripts so I have very little memory of who I was during that time. I’m 23 now, definitely nothing like that anymore but I don’t necessarily hate myself for it either....unfortunately with bpd, we process things a lot different than others....we do a lot of reckless shit and I’ve learned that hating myself for it won’t fix anything, I just need to realize my actions and learn from it....by making this post, you acknowledged what you’re doing and that’s a whole kind of courage in itself."

raisedbynarcissists,fkspx8b,t1_fkrufdh,1584495670.0,"Unless you’re under guardianship legally or something, at 18 you’re a legal adult and they can’t do shit. I had gotten a temporary restraining order after leaving the house at your age and then was granted a permanent one but had some help since my grandpa paid for my lawyer to get me out of there and make it happen quicker. A restraining order isn’t always necessary unless you’re scared they’ll harass or find you. What I would recommend is using your phone to record things without them knowing to have substantial proof you’re being abused. Also in the meantime, start saving money, getting important documents together you might need to get a bank account if you don’t already have one, pay your own phone bill if your mom is still paying it that way they have no control over you whatsoever, etc. I know it’s hard and it’s scary but it’ll be ok."

You have some advantages though, since you’re 17 and technically still a minor, your mother is legally obligated to keep you fed. It’s considered child abuse. I wish I had a solution for you but I’m here if you need to vent because I was in the same situation."

raisedbynarcissists,fiiyr45,t3_f82xz7,1582430347.0,It’s very possible that maybe she just manipulated you into thinking your dad gave her your number. My mother would do that and even go as far as taking my dad’s phone and texting me as him. Ive had several different phone numbers over the years and she somehow manages to get all of them. I love my father who is unfortunately very mentally ill mainly from years of her abuse and she’s manipulated him many times to do things like that. I don’t know your situation but it’s a possibility he was kinda coerced into giving it to her.

Got a permanent restraining order at 18 that my grandparents paid for the lawyer to make it happen (her parents) it’s worth it...it made me feel a sense of closure and safety, however, I would receive texts from random numbers that the police refused to help me with because they came from untraceable text apps and they couldn’t prove it was her although I knew. Probably changed my phone number about 10 times since then. Still worth it if you’re willing to do it."
raisedbynarcissists,fd6sadv,t3_ek6ine,1578195092.0,"You literally just said that he would verbally abuse your mom in front of you and that he got physically violent. Drunk or not, still abuse. Then him saying that he’d ‘forgive you’ when you did nothing wrong and he did is called gaslighting- a typical abuser manipulation tactic. Looks like you answered your own question. Sorry for what you went through and I hope you know now that none of it was your fault."
BPD,fd6rktz,t3_ek6ma7,1578194852.0,I’m the same way. I have trouble articulating my emotions in person so I tend to write it all down instead. Maybe write before therapy sessions that way there’s not as much pressure and frustration trying to explain yourself.
raisedbynarcissists,fd6qqvb,t3_ek6plo,1578194565.0,Same thing happened to me. I felt lucky and also a little confused that my normally abusive mom got me a car but I realized it was only an object for her to have even more control over me. She’d always take the keys. I never got to drive it. I offered to pay for my own insurance..even begged to but no because then she would’ve lost control over me. Luckily a relative gave me an old spare car (also a jeep ironically) but you’re not alone and I’m happy you’re in a better place now!

kratom,fb377jc,t3_eb1d75,1576465874.0,"I was prescribed Klonopin on and off from ages 5 to a year and a half ago when I decided to get clean. I would literally hoard my pills until I had enough to get any kind of high because my tolerance was insane. (Id regularly take anywhere from 10-20mg at once) my stepdad who is a recovering addict introduced Kratom to me after I was about a year clean and said it would help curb any cravings and help anxiety. He said it didn’t have any euphoric effects and wasn’t addictive...he was wrong..I go through about 4 oz of kratom in 2 days now..I take it daily and spend a few hundred a month on it- when i don’t have it for a few days after taking it daily this long, i get mild wd’s (shakes, stomach issues, etc) i almost take it just to avoid that even though sometimes i feel it, others I don’t. I don’t dislike kratom as it’s kept me off hard stuff but I don’t think it’s this non-addictive miracle ‘wellness’ plant either. I kinda just replaced one addiction with another and no one tells you that because most people have never even heard of kratom."

I know kratom is a godsend for a lot of people and former addicts including myself but there are definitely mild withdrawals going without it when you’ve been a daily user (nothing horrible but restless legs, stomach issues, sweating, etc) even if it doesn’t affect me in the same way, sometimes I take it just to avoid the discomfort. This sucks. I don’t dislike kratom but I don’t love it either as I kind of replaced a few addictions with a better, less dangerous one."

At 21, I got clean and tapered off but have had a few relapses in between. I mean, I would take 20mg at once and was fine, that’s how insane my tolerance was. I’ve been sober with the exception of the few relapses since May of 2018 and can say in my case, my memory is shot. I’m only 22, I’m not anywhere as sharp as I used to be...I’m just not the same at all and truly believe it did irreversible damage.

It’s the first thing I do when I wake up. I don’t hate it as it’s helped me with severe panic attacks and depression but no one really tells you about the addiction aspect, especially if you have an addictive personality. If I go without it for just a couple days, I’m in the bathroom all day and get restless legs all night. I’m grateful for kratom as it’s kept me sober from everything else but please just be careful.
