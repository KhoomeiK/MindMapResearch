It seems the break up triggered repressed memories. I thought I was going to die. There would be a moment of relief, and then as if someone stabbed me, tears flooded out of me some more. Six hours of nonstop crying. Sadly I didn’t feel relief afterwards. Thankfully my therapist got trained in EMDR and it helped to seal that wound. I hope you can have another session ASAP and find the root cause of your pain. Sorry you’re going through this. It gets worse, before it gets better. But it does get better."

LifeAfterNarcissism,fiopvkl,t3_f8r2o3,1582588222.0,"I found myself finally experiencing grief the other day. It was a relief to not feel anger. I still hate him more than life, and I’m so angered by the life of lies.  I gave him the best years of my life for promises that never came to fruition. I wonder, how could I have been so stupid? They say believe actions, not words. Somewhere along the way, I stopped. I pray to have peace one day and not feel this anger anymore. I’m dating, but I’m so scared of being hurt again.  I’m in the honeymoon phase and I keep asking myself, am I really being love bombed? How much longer before I’m no longer the object of attention and desire? Or I’m thinking, This isn’t real. He doesn’t really like me for me. He’s with me because I’m giving him something he needs. These are the thoughts I’m trying to keep at bay because I can’t trust that there are good people out there. I want to believe that there are. That they aren’t all narcissist. I’m not sure I can take another heart break. So, I’m trying to not care as much as I once did. Trying desperately to not be codependent. It’s been a year and half for me and I’m just starting to process the grief. Triggers are everywhere in my home. I’m hoping to soon be rid of any mementos that remind me of him and our failed marriage. He took a piece of me that I will never ever recover. That’s what I struggle with the most. I let him abuse me. It was subtle and happened over time. But, there were so many red flags that I just ignored for whatever reason. I’m trying to move forward, but it’s so, damn, hard. All I can say is take it one day at a time. Each day you get through, is another day you survived. Find peace in the little things in life. Whether it’s laughing at wholesome meme, watching videos on YouTube, watching Netflix marathons of your favorite shows, and reach out to people that support you. One doesn’t simply get over this.

Having an illness doesn’t mean you’re going to become the poster child for everything wrong or typical of that disease. I.e. I know plenty of people that grew up in dysfunctional families, yet have happy marriages and lives that contradict their upbringing.

My therapist doesn’t encourage this relationship. Thinks there are more viable options out there. Maybe there are. For now, I’m here because he warned me without going into details. So, without knowing all of the details I’m sensing there’s more to it. It could be my own fear kicking in since this is really my first anything since being separated.  He says he’s on meds, but he is far from mellow. Perhaps, I’ll come to find out he’s a drinker (he’s had a drinks or two when we’ve gone out), financially irresponsible,  in a relationship (haven’t been to his place yet), and therefore I’m just the byproduct of manic episode.

You’re young and while it seems like your world is falling apart, it’s coming together. Look at this as the opportunity to break free and let him go. I believe if you’re meant to be together, then it’ll happen. Don’t chase or beg anyone for their time. You are going to find love again.

I have my own reactions that can be over the top as well. I understand it all to well. It’s my empathy that kept me in miserable marriage for too long. Always looking at the glimmers of good and hoping for them to come out long term. For now all I see is good. I pray it stays that way. Self care is all we can do. You do you. I do me.

There are a few more things I’d like to tackle by myself, luckily I have time to do them. If there’s a pattern in this relatively new relationship, I’m unaware of it. Perhaps, on some level he’s emotionally unavailable and that’s what I find attractive? Perhaps, unconsciously I know he’ll never truly be mine.

I think, it just takes time to feel whole again. I’ve learned happiness beings with yourself. If you’re happy with who you are as a person and can make yourself happy, then you don’t need someone else. When you’re happy on your own, then your partner shares your joy. They’re not the ones meant to make you happy. If they are, then I believe that’s a codependent relationship. Perhaps your therapist can suggest ways to be less codependent. If you’re truly unhappy, plan an exit strategy. If you don’t already have one, create a separate bank account to save some money for yourself. It doesn’t have to be a lot. Just some, in case you feel you need to pick up and go. I hope you find peace. Good luck."
Divorce,fd3v1l6,t1_fd0en4r,1578161864.0,"Please note, I’m separated and in the process of getting a divorce because he’s a lying, cheating, narcissist. His excuse was that for years he tried and that he told me repeatedly that he wasn’t happy. But, here’s the thing, we did counseling for awhile and stopped because presumably things were ok. Things were sort of ok for the most part except for when I would want to be intimate. He would come up with excuses or start a fight. Honestly I should have left years ago, but I didn’t because I don’t believe in divorce. I tried to make things better, but nothing I did made a difference. Now I know it’s because he was having an affair. so I’m wondering, what do you do to improve your marriage? Do you try, or are you expecting your husband to win you back? In a desperate attempt to save my marriage I read a book on how one of you could bring the two of you back together. Basically by focusing on yourself your partner either wakes up or doesn’t. In my case, it worked for awhile. But, he being a narcissist, he was always looking for validation and needed it from more than me. I just wonder, how do successful couples manage the ups and downs and stay focused on each other? Perhaps the key is finding someone that has the same values as you do. Communicating your unhappiness and devising a plan to bring yourselves back to a happy place. I know for me, hearing I didn’t love him was painful because I truly did. But he was projecting his own feelings onto me. I just didn’t see it at the time because I bought his narrative of everything being my fault. I hope you find the courage to make it work or leave. Being alone is far better than being in a relationship with someone that doesn’t care enough about you to make it work."

I complained about the hours, being tired etc. then one day I realized, it was my choice to work so many hours. So, I cut back on the hours at my part-time job. While I was there I appreciated the job and people I worked with. I was much happier. The only thing that changed was my attitude. Then I made an effort to change my full-time job to something that was more satisfying personally. It took awhile, but eventually I changed careers and was able to quit my part time job.

FB posts may seem like she’s the fool, but that tells you right there he lied to her and you. He wanted cake and you gave it to him. I feel sorry for the wife. You love a lie.

I love to travel and have been playing with the idea of going somewhere on my own, but I think fear is preventing me from actually doing it. Even when I’m with others I tend to be afraid to venture out. I’ve gotten better, but as I take three steps forward, I also take one step back. I return back to my comfortable surroundings. I wish I could just pick up myself and go somewhere. I’m comfortable being alone, doing things alone like having dinner in restaurants and that sort of thing. But, god do I wish I could just go to another country, lay on the beach, and enjoy the local surroundings. I’m older now, so I imagine I’ll have a hard time finding people my own age (49) as I travel. Maybe, I just need to get over myself, and just do it as the old Nike ad says.

Many preferred phone meetings instead of in person. I’ve never done online, but it worked for them. Now I’m just doing therapy, but may need to go back to ACOA as I’m not living my best life either. Not related to being an adult child, but in the end, isn’t it always at the root of everything? Not sure of your age, but if you’re in college they may have meetings too. I went for just over a year when I was in college, and it was the best thing ever. I cried afterwards for hours, but let go of a lot pain. Start with the book.

Not sure if you’re familiar with ACOA, but it’s definitely worth looking in to if you’re not. Check out the book, it will never happen to me. It helped put my childhood in perspective and began my healing journey. I made peace with the alcoholic in my life. I somehow I understood him. On the other hand I’m still grappling with his spouse, the enabler. I can’t be around her for long because I just get so upset. I type this as I prepare to spend Christmas with my family. They mean well, they really do. They just so wo how know which buttons to press that push me over the edge. But that’s the key, to not react. I can manage that in small doses.

Her feelings are hurt? Well then maybe she’ll think about how she’s hurt you with her selfish behavior. Addiction is a disease, yes. But, it’s manageable with self care, reflection, medication, and a support group that helps one change their thoughts and habits of the past. Your family is just enabling her and making excuses because they might have to look at themselves. Alcoholic families fall into a pattern and everyone plays a role. Braking the cycle is difficult. The drinking might skip a generation, but the attitudes, fears, and dysfunctional thinking are passed on. Find yourself a support group and keep taking care of yourself. Only you can make yourself happy. Don’t let their guilt ruin that for you. They don’t live in your head or pay your bills. Good luck."
ptsd,fc0bi2y,t1_fbzlx7h,1577285951.0,"Pain and suffering are difficult. No one, myself included can handle another’s burden for too long. Therapist are trained to listen. Sometimes that’s all we need, is to be heard and have our feelings validated.  A good one can help you process the trauma, so that it becomes a memory without emotion attached to it. Finding one is the hard part. Hopefully you have 𝖨𝗇𝗌𝗎𝗋𝖺cne and can find one that accepts yours. A therapist that doesn’t deal with insurance, in my opinion isn’t worth it because you don’t need financial stress on top of everything else."

For some reason they love to talk about the past and it’s always rosier than I remember. Or it’s a competition of who had it worse. I carry my pain and suffering well, until I don’t. I snap, lose my calm, and let the repressed anger out. I suggest you journal your thoughts down on paper. Perhaps you have a repressed memory and that’s why you feel dirty. Some kind of abuse that you may have forgotten about. I was always painfully aware of mine, and never knew what to do with it. I was miserable and sad no matter what my circumstances. I know someone that had blocked out being sexually abused by a sibling. When she confronted her parents, they denied it ever happened. Your worst nightmare come true. So, family can definitely bring you down and make you depressed. Try therapy again. It’s not easy, but eventually it helps. If you can’t remember the trauma, it could be you’re not ready for it. Mine was triggered when I read a self help book. Never do that unless you’re in therapy. I was flooded with memories and it was overwhelming. Found a therapist ASAP after that. It helped. Not sure how I was able to function on a daily basis, but I did. I wish you luck."

My latest bout is due to a failed marriage that in of itself would be hard on anyone. Mine has special sauce as I was with a lying, cheating, narcissist and I was blind sided by his affair. In hind sight the signs were all there I just kept labeling the red flags as, it must be my fault. I’m struggling now.  I manage to go to work and pay my bills. But I feel like I’m barely hanging on. There are things I need to do and I can’t seem to wrap my brain around getting them done. Perhaps it’s some kind of emotional paralysis that prevents me from moving on and embracing my freedom. I find myself short on friends and those that I do have, I tend to push away because who wants to be around someone so miserable? I never thought of myself being foggy brained, but it makes sense as I can’t handle to much deep thought. I’ve become comfortably numb to myself and others. Therapy, for those that suggest it, doesn’t seem to work. I’m giving it a go, but I’m not moving forward and I don’t know how. Doing things for myself like going to the gym and self-care, just seem pointless."

I’m almost 50 and have found myself in a similar situation due to separation and inevitable divorce. My friends have all moved on or are to busy to do things because their worried about saving their own relationships. I have a lot of fake friends and it’s really depressing at times. I’m learning to embrace being alone and I’m figuring out how not to be depressed. Therapy hasn’t been working for me.

When I was younger I never was at a loss for meeting people. I was too blind to see the ones that were interested in me and stayed, and married the wrong person. He was just always there to pick up the pieces whenever my life fell apart. Keep your standards high and don’t settle. You’re into the arts and culture. Perhaps venturing out to museums and social gatherings that interest you, will bring you a like minded partner.

But, they lie and do it so well that you doubt yourself. You will never trust him. Counseling for 2 1/2 years is too long. If nothing changes in 6 months it never will. Cut the cord and move on. It’ll be hard, but doubting yourself is no way to live. Have something, is not better than nothing. The peace you will feel once you rely on yourself will be priceless. Separated and on my own now. Divorce is just a matter of time, I hate myself for ignoring all the red flags and believing the lies, I love you, I’m sorry, trust me, etc. when someone walks away from you, let them. Life is too short to be with someone that thinks there’s always something better out there."

I thought that once you we’re married they are with you through good and bad. To help you through your dark times. Sadly, I chose someone that acted like the person I needed, but at the Core was a shell of a human being himself. I’m happy to be free of him and on my own. I may or may not find love again.

NarcissisticAbuse,esgd3ep,t3_c7lpvt,1561949575.0,"I think it’s in our nature to not want to believe the person we loved couldn’t be a narcissist. Sadly, it is who they are and we must accept it, so we can move forward with our lives. We can’t change them as much as we want to. They lie, gaslight and do whatever makes them feel good because they only care about themselves. It’s a harsh reality, but it is who they are. Mine had many faces and he appeared to be Mr. Wonderful to the outside world. Doting husband that any woman would be happy to have. Or so I was told over and over again because I didn’t appreciate him, or love him or insert whatever need he needed because it was never enough. If I did what he asked and pointed it out he would bring up,something from 5, 10, 15, 20 years ago to prove I didn’t love him. I was like didn’t we talk about this and move past it? I know I forgave and forgot many things you said and did because I love you. But he’d have a counter argument for it all. In the end he was projecting his feelings onto me because he was having an affair. There were many red flags I was just too blind to see them. So, stop thinking about whether he is one or isn’t and focus on getting yourself back. Focus on why you attracted him and how to prevent from attracting another. You can’t control him. If it makes you feel better, tell yourself he’s not a narcissist. Instead tell yourself he’s a poor communicator, who broke my trust by _______ and I will not accept that type of behavior in my relationship. I deserve to be with someone that loves and  respects me. Actions speak louder than words. Be with someone that respects you. Good luck."

My sacrifices would be worth it in the end when he finally lands the dream job after supporting him 25+ years. Waiting got me nothing, but heartache and heartbreak over and over again. Trauma bonding, hovering, discard, repeat. I thought it was me because he was very convincing. It hurts. It’s like being stabbed in the heart and having the blade chip off to keep you hemorrhaging on the inside. Be happy he’s leaving you. It’s going to hurt, but let it. If I just walked away the first time I maybe would have a different story to share. Unfortunately it took me a long time to learn the lesson in this relationship. They lies, cheat and gaslight you into questioning your own sanity. He’s saying nice things now, but wait and see how generous he is when it times to settle the marriage. He may not be so giving then. Be strong and be brave. Walk away with your head held high because he has nothing but pain to share with you."

I no longer question myself, wonder what did I do wrong, or waste my time trying to fix a broken marriage. Being discarded like trash was the most heartbreaking thing for me. But, I will never go back again. It took being burned to a cinder to realize how toxic he was for me. I don’t have the answer. I’m trying to get past the anger and move towards acceptance,  but it’s tough.  Cheating is cruel and unusual punishment for a wrong you never knew you did to them. Then he’ll say but we talked or I told you what I needed. He talked to so many women he seriously believed he talked to me. I had no clue because he talked to every woman, but me.  The worst is they’ll never admit they cheated. They’ll gaslight you and you just have to walk away because you will make yourself crazy trying to break down their lies into truths. Life too short ."

If you’re in the city it’s easier to do those things. Explore. You’ll meet people along the way. Maybe I should take my own advice. Funny thing happened to me just now, a guy I chatted with and then he unmatched when I wouldn’t give him my number after his 2nd text, matched me again. Like, why?
