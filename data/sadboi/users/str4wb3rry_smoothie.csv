I no longer feel safe in a school environment.

How is that not racism, how would you feel if everyday, you were called coronavirus and being asked stupid questions on purpose. You wouldn't understand because you aren't in my situation. In the UK, there has only been 2 cases and they aren't even in my city, the kids know I haven't left the UK and know I was born here.

Please think carefully about sensitive topics in the future and don't assume something isn't as worse as it is.


Edit: spelling

You mentioned how tjey would be cautious of chinese people coming from china, don't assume all chinese people are from china. Also the coronavirus only has a 1 percent death rate and the flu is worse."

ask,fgk29u0,t1_fgjy6w4,1580855999.0,"Thanks for the many options, I think it's best if I wait it out and then try to call them out for being racist. Then teachers will naturally hear the word racist and have attention to what they are doing.

I also agree with you on the different cultures. They all eat meat and eat some sort of animal so they can't say anything and also, they really are ignorant. Although different cultures have a part in the consumption but the videos spreading on social media about animal consumption are mainly people looking for clout and I really don't like the fact that just because of one person, everyone online would think the whole race is like that. (The majority of China really are against bat and rat consumption as it is unsanitary and can cause diseases)

It annoys me even more how if a white person did that, everyone would assume it was just one person being crazy for clout or if a black person was being treated the way I was, there would be a whole ""black lives matter"" movement. I'm not hating on black people's rights but just because chinese are chinese, they are expected to just accept all the hate and rudeness and it just baffles me how rude, racist and xenophobic people can be at a time where many people are innocent and have nothing to do with the actions taken.

(Sorry for the mini rant) 

All in all though, I thank you for the advice."

Making clothes can also destress yourself and relax.

If you can't do that, maybe consider applying for jobs like librarian where it is kinda easy money but this might not earn you the most money.
In my local library here, they have donations which you can collect such as food, clothes, sanitary products etc...

You can also try speaking to the government. I don't know about USA but here, we can talk to the government about financial situations and they can help you find a temporary shelter and provide some food if you qualify. Maybe you should find out if your area does that or not.

You can also sue your lanlord for such acts if you have documents etc... 

My family were in a similar situation (leaving us broke) a few years back and we sued the lanlord.
What we did during that time was ask schools and stores for food etc... I was in school at that time so we got food but I don't know about your situation. Maybe stores will have food at the end of a shift, you could try that.

I have felt the same for 3 years but I want to hold myself until 18 (don't know about USA but in UK,18 is legal adult age). Once I hit 18, I plan to live in an apartment or rent student living. My advice for you would to just hold on and see if things get better, i know it won't and in my case too, it didn't but just wait.. If that doesn't work either, you can always ask for legal help. You can get in contact with legal help through trusted teachers. MAKE SURE YOU 100 PERCENT TRUST THEM NOT TO SPREAD THIS SITUATION WITH YOUR PARENTS.

I know this sounds crazy and I am giving them the benefit of doubt but maybe they are tired and frustrated from life and maybe they weren't ready for kids. I can't speak for them but maybe they are just maturing.

I don't know if this even helped but I want to tell you my experience to see if it helps you find a solution.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

My Chinese parents are extremely strict. I am talking about 8pm bedtime and anything past it I will get beaten... My dad smokes and it is bad for my asthma and triggers my panick attacks.

My mum lied to the doctors on 2 occasions that I was rushed to the ER and said ""there was no history of smokers or abusive behaviour in the family"" this lead to family thinking I was lying about everything and that I was looking for attention. This was when I was 8 so I brushed it off. 

I have sleeping problems and probably have undiagnosed insomnia and I have to listen to music to sleep. This means that i sleep with my phone and earphones, on 8 ocasions, I have woken up to my mother or father slapping me thinking I played on my phone.

These were a few of many situations such as bleach feeding, abusing etc... and I began to make a plan to run away.

I wasn't going to run away too soon as they would call up the police and they would assume the adult is more mature and would trust the adult. So I decided that I would wait until I was legally an adult as if I am under 18, they would associate me with my mum. Once I turn 18, I get total control on my life decisions and would be protected by the law so my plan was : 

‚Ä¢ Wait till 16 (minimum working age in the UK) to get a part time job.

‚Ä¢ Save up a small amount of savings for 2 years

‚Ä¢ Once I turn 18, I will be in university so I could either 1. sign up for student living  2. Get a temporary home in a foyer (I'm leaning towards the University option but if I borrow government money, I will have to repay once I finish getting the education.)

‚Ä¢ Live my life and not have any interactions with my parents (just my siblings).


Again, I don't know if this helped but we are in the same boat. I wish you the bestest of luck in finding a home and I just hope you make the correct descision for yourself.
