You need to play with above level 3 participation
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Skirmish_reward_track

Participation is shown in a pop up just above your minimap.

Capturing anything above a camp will give you 10 minutes participation.

https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/WvW_Skirmish_Claim_Ticket

WvW Skirmish Claim Tickets are a currency earned by participating in World versus World for completing tiers of the Skirmish reward track. They are stored in the Account Wallet. 

https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Legendary_armor
At the bottom of the page are the requirements for legendary armor pieces, note that is for each piece.

Full set skirmish ticket total cost 	7,880 WvW Skirmish Claim Tickets 	
**Approximate time for total tickets 	22 weeks @ 365 tickets per week** 	

https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Grandmaster_Mark_Shard

Grandmaster Mark Shards will help ease the costs of building armor.

Grandmaster Marks are used as currency to exchange for stat selectable Ascended armors and weapons. All prefixes can be selected, but expansion specific prefixes are unavailable unless they are owned.

Acquisition method Contained in Box of  Box of Grandmaster Marks — Up to three can be obtained once per PvP League season, or purchased using 10  Grandmaster Mark Shards from the Skirmish Supervisor at any time.

Recipe
Each mark requires their respective recipe and items from Recipe Book: Grandmaster Craftsman's Components. Both can be purchased from BLING-9009, Ascended Armor League Vendor, Ascended Weapon League Vendor or Skirmish Supervisor. Each mark requires their respective level 500 crafting discipline. 

Don't play wvw just for legendary armor, you will hate it.

You have 5 guild slots. Many servers link up for a number of weeks. Look for groups of players in your timetable. One is enough, above 5 is better. See if you can get into voice communications with them. There are different flavours of guilds, some you will like more than others, if this guild is in a linked server, save up gems to move to theirs. Some people worry about being on a winning server, I would say it's better to be on a fun server.

Skirmish reward track levels you want to take into ccount.

Wood lets you achieve a extra pip per tick on next week, you should try for minimum of full wood skirmish reward track, 4 wood chests.

Bronze level gives you a Warlord's Armor Box to get an exotic armor piece, and unlock warlords skins, one per week.

Bronze, Silver and Wood give Grandmaster Mark Shards these you can use to help buy ascended or legendary equipment.

Each level up to the first diamond track will earn WvW Skirmish Claim Tickets exponentially, so the first diamond track completion will reward you the most WvW Skirmish Claim Tickets.

You need to doubt and reason everything.  

I have rich and poor, family and friends.  

It’s math.  Divide murders by people in a worth bracket.  

As an interesting social commentary of about 10 murders committed by rich, nobody went to prison, it was an accident, it didn’t happen or they never captured them, even knowing who they were.  Police kind of diplomatically approached the family and the murderers were sent to study abroad.

Edit: murders I somehow know by knowing the people involved or their friends.  And one of the murdered was a friend, when your friends do dumb stuff, get away as fast as possible.  

There is an old saying, “better it be said he ran here, than, he died here.  

My old friend saying  was “ are you going to let that slide?” , you know what, I don’t even remember where I was punched, so yes that slid away pretty good."

Sorry, I think my response and yours might lack definition.  

We both might be agreeing and not putting our points across that well.  

It’s been a long day.  

My response kind of came out mildly lacking."

I am just trying to add to what you are saying.  

They will be able to draw opposite conclusions from the same experience.  

Specially with some funded Facebook propaganda."

There are great people both rich and poor.  

Most are so so sort of ok.  

I have seen rich rich and poor poor people being assholes.  

So really no exclusivity, although rich rich can have a big proportion of assholes who think murder or thievery can be Fun. A few poor do it too."
Calgary,fnxno0l,t1_fnw5x3b,1587342469.0,"Here’s the deal.  

This virus kills by viral load or because you have another condition.  

A flu can be another condition.  

This virus is very contagious.  

If we slow this down it will kill less than 1 percent, and most wont notice it.  

We don’t slow it down, it will kill up to 5 percent or more, and many will be permanently impaired.  

If ALL goes good, social distancing WILL have seen unnecessary.  If we don’t we do well we will be shoveling dead people and many will be permanently messed up. 

Permanently is a big word Gals and Guys."
