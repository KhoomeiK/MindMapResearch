depression,fgkngsc,t3_ez0kfc,1580869538.0,"I would suggest that a change of perspective is what you need. Relationships with others can be much much more than self validation. Relationships can challenge you to become better, relationships are a way for you to share the great things about you with others and receive the great qualities they have in return. The expectations you are explaining seem limiting to your self and your happiness. You don’t need relationships for validation you deserve relationships for happiness and fulfillment, which is given and received by both parties. Bullying is not a measuring tool of relationships or of yourself. Much more a reflection of those bullies that likely lashed out at you for reasons far less about you and much more about a self attempt to gain control and a sense of power. 

Your request for a comment that would make you think other wise tells me you are a logical thinker. What is a worthless freak? That isn’t quantifiable.  Just a construct you can choose or not choose to give validation too. Similarity to self esteem nothing in created instantly. Something must keep you going that last 20 years. That is something to be proud of, something to build self esteem on. 

Keep going and keep working on yourself. Empower yourself. Be an inspiration. Be you. Wish you the best."
