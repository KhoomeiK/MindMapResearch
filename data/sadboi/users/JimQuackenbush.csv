kratom,fqnxj6w,t1_fqnse37,1589503373.0,I have found that to relax me as well. I wasnt sure if that was just me or if it really did help. Also eating something seems to help too but I'm very calorie conscious and I hate doing thar.

kratom,fprp2uk,t1_fpqc68b,1588859223.0,I hit mine with the hottest water from the tap. Just enough to let it mix. Then I top it off with some cold water to make it drinkable. All using smallest amounts of water. I then chug it like a frat boy. Try to really toss it back and not let your tongue touch any. 3 seconds and its over.

I decided to take it apart and I could see there was (somehow) a wire broke off the circuit board. Since its basically a switch I did the only thing I could do and permanently connected the two wires, bypassing the switch. I got green light instead of red so that might be the fix. It won't automatically shut off when it's out of water now but that's ok. I am currently trying to get the darn thing back together to see if it's going to run properly."

I wanted an actual conversion and I got down-voted to the point I deleted my post. I'm not sure why I care about imaginary points on a social media, but I do, at least a little bit.
