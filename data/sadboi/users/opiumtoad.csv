offmychest,finp9y3,t1_finoupz,1582567613.0,"Ok. My post was just about how I think the 2% thing isn't true, and how I think it's upsetting that people use it, even if it is true, as a justification to be phobic of people. And I didn't say I've met more than 140 million people or however many I just feel like lgbt are a lot more common in my life than 2%, so are probably more common around the world too. And even if it's not, I'm just tired of phobic ppl and their excuses."
offmychest,finoqxg,t1_finohxi,1582567303.0,So you are transphobic and live in a transphobic country
offmychest,fin9da8,t1_fin8ytc,1582558764.0,Well that's the thing. There's no reason for younger people to have different identity rates than older people. Younger people are just more ready to accept themselves because of the world they grew up in. And yeah. Even 2% of the population is a fricking lot. It's crazy how people actually use THAT argument as a way to justify not giving a damn about lgbtq people and their rights and humanity.

FamilyProblems,fieuf1o,t3_f13u9d,1582382686.0,"Hi.. I know a little a bout this kind of situation. I'm a sister who used to drink a little too much too often too. For me personally, just having an ear to babble to during my time in recovery (I'm sober now) would have helped a lot, but I had no one. She probably needs someone to talk to, and she probably loves you. If it's draining to listen to, I can imagine! But it will help her so much that you're being supportive. But you don't need to take more than you can handle.

Just remember how much you're helping, because she is probably going through a lot right now, maybe more than she can even say if you can imagine that. But again, you don't need to take more than you can handle! I hope this was a little helpful. Maybe you can gently let her know if you need a break sometimes. Sorry for writing such a long comment I do hope it's a little helpful"

Psychic,fgyp83g,t3_f0ue5d,1581185465.0,"It's perfectly normal and fine! You're not crazy things like this happen all the time. It's like when you have a dream and some parts of it happen in your life a little while later. But because you were so focused on this book, you channeled a lot of your energy into it, and you must have carried some of that energy a long with you to here. But obviously it doesn't mean that this person you know now is a VILLAIN, it doesn't mean that at all. When this kind of weird stuff happens I know it feels unsettling but it's way more normal than people realise just because it's not super talked about but it's normal.
Edit! But from what I've realised, it's usually a better idea to trust your hunch than call yourself crazy. Do research."
psychicdevelopment,fgym6z9,t3_extvfx,1581184737.0,"Some say that dreams are like indicators of where your subconscious is at, and because we bother ourselves with so much conscious stuff during the day, our subconscious story takes a little longer to develop and be realised and become obvious in the daylight but you get peeks into it when you sleep."

I avoid practicing psychic stuff for that reason but it's cool it k ow where it is anyway. Cool. There must just be way too much there for me to handle right now. I haven't been in tune for a long time but I've found other ways to feel my way around it's been cool"

depression,fgl15nj,t3_enrs4c,1580878838.0,"Whenever I'm feeling bad and try saying anything my mum will always tell me to shut up and stop being so negative all the time. It's impossible to be heard when you feel bad. People only listen when you're in a chipper mood or else why should they waste their energy engaging with you?

That's how my mum is anyway and it's affected me a lot but, haha, any time I see my friends mum, she is wonderful I'll call her Angie for now,(not her real name) she snaps me out of it. It's like she really cares about me and sees more in me than anyone else. She can break my negative thinking pattern in a second, I can't believe she can do that for any reason but she truly cares and believes in me.

So, I guess just don't give up hope that you'll be able to talk to someone someday! Because you might end up talking to someone who really cares and believes in you.

♡bless Angie♡"

Feminism,famyelv,t1_fako7je,1576216730.0,"Unpopular opinion: gender doesn't exist (however gender expression does exist) and the difference between a penis and a vagina or any organ alike, is irrelevant to a conversation this important, because violence is violence no matter who's it done to. Adding gender to the conversation complicates things 100% or the time and wouldn't be necessary if we all looked at all humans as just humans.
