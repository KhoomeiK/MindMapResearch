On the farm we have a trick we do on posts to save a little money on concrete:  we fill the hole in with crusher run but we also buy a sack of plain portland cement and toss a little scoop of that down occasionally while we're filling the hole.  We tamp it down and it's not as good as just using concrete but it does firm up the crusher run and makes for a very long-lasting, strong post.  If the weather's real dry we'll wet the hole down a bit but if there's rain in the forecast or the ground's especially wet we don't bother with that.

IIRC, the only ""states rights"" anyone got out of it was some excise tax stuff and the ability to recall a federal judge.

The Civil War was never about state's rights.  That was not an issue the seceding states gave a damn about (see: fugitive slave act changes in the compromise of 1850 that gave more power to the Federal government to return runaway slaves).  Read the declarations of secession.
