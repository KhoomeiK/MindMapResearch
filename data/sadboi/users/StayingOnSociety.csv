Even though you'll never get the chance to talk to him, i'm sure he thought about you, wondered how you were doing, and cared for you, the same why i, and a lot of other people that are adopted feel.

Chances are, you may be left with a couple friends, and that can be daunting (it was for me), but it also makes things a lot more simpler. Or my second suggestion (if you don't want to cut them off), would be knowing the difference between your friends and 'social acquaintances', so at least you then you know that they aren't reliable when it comes to those sorts of things.

Personally I’ve had times where I’ve felt really down about myself, as I’m constantly comparing myself to people from social media. I think it shows women that there are much better looking men in different parts of the world, which then leads to them thinking that they won’t settle for anything less than that, which is unrealistic.

I also live in the real world, and am in touch, and aware of what’s going on, I’ll tell you what I see, gender inequality, predominantly towards men. I interact with women on a day-to-day basis, as that’s what my job requires, and with my management being female, it’s hard to interact with women.

First off spoilt for choice with what? A news article from The Daily Mail implying there is a gender pay gap? The same gender pay gap which no one seems to know anything about, and when confronted with the question, “so, what companies pay women less and how much less do they get paid in comparison to men”, it’s the same answer, “I don’t know, they just do”. Because as with everything, people take something they see on social media, or the news, and take it at face value and merely speculate, with no factual information to the contrary.

MensRights,ernfm09,t1_erneo8g,1561051574.0,"It’s a fine line, say one wrong thing and you may be interpreted as a misogynist, you see, people are afraid to speak up because of this, no one holds their own opinions anymore because of the way others may perceive them.  In my workplace, management is predominately female, and I see gender inequality every day, but due to the stigma around the whole thing, I’m afraid if I spoke up, I wouldn’t be talking seriously, or would be penalised for it. It’s a difficult position to be in, not only for me, but also for the people that feel as strongly as I do about this, and other matters related to gender inequality."
MensRights,erneydl,t1_ernejj3,1561051159.0,"I couldn’t agree with you more there. Even the term ‘feminist’ has become diluted, and poisoned by these extreme misandrists, ‘female empowerment’ is nothing more than a ploy to draw other women into thinking they’re fighting for a just cause, and the media is constantly indoctrinating people with catchy titles, into thinking that male privilege is still a thing, when in fact it’s quite the opposite."
MensRights,erneh8r,t1_erne7kg,1561050862.0,"110% spot on. The media, ignorance, and lack of factual information are the route cause of this misandrist, megalomaniacal chaos. I just wish someone in power would speak up about it, and make an attempt to stop, or make others aware of this madness."
AskReddit,erndst3,t3_c2uzlj,1561050431.0,That male privilege still exists.
MensRights,erndpb0,t1_ernd855,1561050369.0,"You and I are definitely on the same wave length here! There are no facts behind a lot of the stuff that people hear in the media, that points to male privilege and misogyny, so how can people talk, and act on a cause that they haven’t even looked into properly. I just see no logic in it, at all."
MensRights,erndbsr,t1_ern0nin,1561050129.0,"Sadly it’s because people don’t want men to dominate certain industries anymore, and companies are put under so much pressure to be diverse, and be seen by other companies, media, employees etc as being diverse. It’s sad that everyone has to be pleased, and as a result of this, people can’t hire who they want, or promote who they want, because they feel obliged by society to make these ‘diverse’ choices, which if you ask me, is bullshit. How can you promote a women because there are no other female managers, even though you may have a male, that does his job 10x better, but will be put aside because it wouldn’t be seen as diverse, it’s completely absurd."
MensRights,erncvta,t1_ern0hpq,1561049849.0,Haha lol! Totally agree !
MensRights,erncuz8,t1_ermtflo,1561049834.0,"And the media are usually the ones responsible for the rising tensions. They post these bullshit stories with catchy titles aimed at the gender inequality between men and women, and of course, men being the culprit for the inequality every time. When a lot of people see this sort of stuff, especially young people, they take it at face value without even looking into it. I’ve had times when I’ve asked someone “well tell me, what companies pay women less than men”, and every time I get the same answer, “I don’t know, they just do”. I’m not disputing that there aren’t companies that do that, I’m saying if people are going to say that, then they need to have the facts in order. I also totally agree with the stuff you hear about oppressed women in the 1950’s, 60’s, 70’s, 80’s & 90’s. the thing is, most people complaining about inequality, and that refer to those eras when they do, are people that have never lived in those times, so have absolutely no clue what is was like first hand. I feel like the tables have turned for the worst, and in living in the time we live in now, it shouldn’t be happen on both sides of the genders."
MensRights,erms7h1,t1_ermrext,1561035565.0,"Completely agree. The phrase ‘Equal Opportunity’ has unfortunately become diluted in today’s society, as people sadly believe that having opportunities that are only open to women is a resolution to gender inequality, when in fact it’s just creating an even bigger ‘gap’ between the sexes, the same ‘gap’ that the media, and women talk about as being unequal."
