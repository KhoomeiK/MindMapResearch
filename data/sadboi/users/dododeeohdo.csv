I believe a couple can work through this dilemma and that intimacy and love is never just penis in vagina sex. Your gf is EXTREMELY fortunate that you are willing to continue to be physically intimate. I am actually tearing up that you have this extent of kindness and my partner does not.

I really think this is the biggest issue. You appear to have no interest in giving a woman pleasure and that is worth some serious exploration. 

I no longer expect sex from my “partner” but had always looked to share other intimacy. Even just talking with him. Or taking a walk. Watching a tv show. Going to a movie. It has waned so much over the months. It is nil.
