depression,f9g4nwh,t1_f8zke25,1575293258.0,"PFTT. like with sexuality. This is why I don't really like regular people like that, who aren't uniq in any way, who haven't been through some shit."
depression,f9g4kh7,t3_e2z1eq,1575293211.0,"Yes. Most people will never understand other people who has been through some other things, they haven't themselves... which makes pretty good sense. But It can feel like they don't even want to try and understand."
depression,f9g4737,t3_e2wpqd,1575293051.0,"I have this weird things where I don't remember almost anything from my childhood tho, IDK WHY, was I a stupid kid or maybe actually depressed? although I have been told I was a VERY happy kid and cheerful, and so I mostly do look like that in the photos."
depression,f9g40et,t3_e2wpqd,1575292944.0,"Yes. And it is super normal, that is how the brains work. But sometimes I remember them, but it dosen't say much to me anymore... those memories."
depression,f9g3b3c,t3_e1u1c2,1575292608.0,"Yea, thought about this a lot for a long time before, multiply times, even in periods. Even though of jumping out of the window once, very strongly bc I just had sat there crying for more than two hours, not feeling any better. But I was scared of the dying being hurtful, and somewhere inside me I still wanted to keep trying this thing ""so called life"", (been depressed badly once before,  and I did manage to get out of it... but it was surely a hole other reason for getting into it, not like this reason.)

now I rarely do it as much, feel suicidal... probably bc I actually want to feel better, HECK if nobody cares about me, family or not. I wanna make something out of my life, so this is my motivation for now... but it is hard to even start, when you are still very depressed and have a lot to work on with that and other things with yourself as well."
depression,f9g305j,t3_e466xi,1575292416.0,"Might be a depression diagnosis, if you have no reason at all to feel like this...?

I mean I knew my reasons, bc I had something trigger my depression and more to it.

And then after that I just knew there was more to it, also my relationships with my family and myself to a surden degree. But some of it, I had to dig up from the dept of my brains suppressing the painful feelings for so long, mostly bc I couldn't understand them very well before turning adult teen. It took me some time, sometimes months.

But sometimes when I have been allowing myself to thinking too much about it, trying to get them back too much or understand them for too long, this way it hurts too much, then I either consciously or my brains does it itself, ""shut down"" and I feel this kind of emptiness, feeling foggy or ""something is there"" feeling, but then remember the reasons- bc now I learned them."
depression,f9f2g06,t3_e2lueb,1575257799.0,"True, this.

Family is what you make, you choose and they choose you. They can be friends."
depression,f9f261m,t3_e2br5s,1575257588.0,YES...!
depression,f9f230t,t1_f8t5r1x,1575257524.0,"I feel like this too in periods, depending on my situation..."
depression,f9f20vv,t1_f8sqoyh,1575257481.0,Same.
depression,f9f1z6w,t3_e1dmmd,1575257448.0,"It is actually not healthy, I read it is taking actual effect on your body. You can get really sick physical too, if you doesn't get better slowly at some point. Or your body will lose a few years of living span, at the end of your life."
depression,f9f1s77,t3_e1dmmd,1575257313.0,"Yes,

sometimes I feel like I have cancer or something, bc of the emotional pain coming through to physical. In my chest area, sometimes by the heart, sometimes under the breast, sometimes headaches like it is broken."
depression,f9f1moh,t1_f8vxwpm,1575257208.0,"Aw man, sometimes by blood are just not your ""real family"" out there, but the ones you make.

sorry tho, no one deserves such parents. my mom might not be hole hearted, by she does do somewhat what is moral right as a parent... from what she knows. Still she is a big reason I am depressed.

Happy birthday late birthday!

Man, I wish I wasn't late! Hope your day was alright, and you got yourself a treat! :) Bc that is what I do, when no one cares for me."
depression,f9f1d8l,t1_f8viax2,1575257018.0,"Yea, with depression, it can be really really hard when you can't even sleep properly or normal when nightmares haunt you often..."
depression,f9f1a3z,t1_f8vak5t,1575256951.0,"Yea, sometimes I also just can't sleep, if feeling too restless, too depressed, and mad and sad. Even after a 8 mile run and the body was tired, fucking brains."
depression,f9f15is,t1_f8xtfoj,1575256855.0,Had this thought too.
depression,f9f0yzz,t3_e2gnrw,1575256722.0,"Mostly sleep 10+ hours. But naturally.

Sometimes bc I can't bare to think or deal with those things that keeps making depressed, like my mom, or myself.

&#x200B;

Normally, before depression I only needed 7,8,9 hours."
depression,f9f0kcz,t1_f90n7lt,1575256407.0,"I do this too, started writing diary, and it seems to be such a good thing to do!

I am about to start my second, on the new year soon. I do also keep a digital diary of what I need to tell my therapist and what I did tell her, just in case, the physical diary is mostly more personal, to keep track of my feelings and for future help. 

Writing diary is also for not having to keep remembering myself to remember those hurtful memories and feelings, when they do come up on the surface."
depression,f9f04on,t3_e33wws,1575256077.0,"I also struggle, when I finally decided to try a therapist.

But... I am actually trying to be open about my situation and myself,

but when she wants me to explain further, give more details,

I seem to suffer so much- not really being able to explain the things more... Idk, and for some reason, the way I try and explain, I seem like such a HUGE low self-esteem and dumb person, it dosen't sound like me at all! I just can't seem to explain things properly for her... idk what to do, I haven't even tried that many times, bc I felt so low of self esteem after, which you already do when depressed.

I probably struggle, bc my memory isn't that good and with depression it weakens even more, and I know my brains are really good at surepressing painful memories, whenever I want to forget or not, so I do lose a lot of details and it can take me a lot of time and a lot of painful time to try and get them on the surface again, so I can understand myself and how to work with this."
