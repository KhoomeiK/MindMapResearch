Anxiety,f9x82as,t3_e6t3w4,1575706414.0,"I deal with this a ton. I'm a pretty young shift lead at a restaurant, and I've got very little experience besides college. I'm constantly dealing with the back and forth, ""did I disappoint my managers?"" (even though I know it's not an issue because they communicate very well with me) and ALSO wanting our employees to like me as well. I'm one step higher on the ladder, but I know my age is offputting to some people as I hear through the grapevine. 

My biggest problem is that I blame myself for a LOT of stuff. Whether it's the TVs not working, or if it's an employee's attitude. I feel like I could have done something to prevent it. My therapist puts it pretty simple to me every week... ""It's not my fault"". I just need to keep repeating it to myself. I'm not sure if it helps your individual case, but it is helping me get through my shifts more and more. With that, I'm also starting to learn how to lead better and stand up for myself when I do get an attitude from someone or when I can't fix a problem. 

We're in this together! You're not the only one. I'm SURE some of your coworkers feel the same privately. If I can tell you one thing from my personal management style (not everyone's): I usually forget pretty quickly when an employee makes a mistake. I know them pretty well, and I know when it's uncharacteristic of them. As long as you are doing your job, being respectful and friendly with your coworkers and bosses, then I'm sure they love you!"
TooAfraidToAsk,f8me36n,t1_f8lvzqv,1574630535.0,"There is a whole world of beer out there. I work at a brewery, and I sometimes have to help a customer identify a beer by the smell and color. I love (craft) beer. I still can‚Äôt do Bud, Miller, Etc. I think domestic beers have little to no difference. Craft beer can differ in many ways, fruity, roasty, malty, spicy, sour, and more probably. Identifying some tastes is harder than others. I personally believe there‚Äôs a beer for everyone, you just have to explore and find it. 

Domestic beer is a good starting spot though! If you ever go somewhere that offers samples of their beers, I encourage you to try some!"

I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if they do a flash forward to 2019 and reference the Area 51 raid as well.
