In fact, in 2019 no British nationalist parties got any seats at all since the main right wing party, the Conservatives, were nationalist enough to convince far right voters to vote for them.

I guess Rutte and his government probably wanted to avoid the bad press from working with a nationalist party. Or maybe the VVD and PVV just couldn‚Äôt come to an agreement for how the coalition would work.

And I suppose the Brexit mess has killed off a lot of nationalist/Eurosceptic sentiment among the public. It‚Äôll be interesting to see how it affects voting patterns in EU countries."

I usually find that if I get invested in a show and there's a sad ending I get genuinely emotionally disturbed.

Not to overshare, but I only decided to watch BF because I'm having serious struggles with depression at the moment, and I went into the series knowing nothing about it other than that it was about a gay relationship, which I thought would be something I'd enjoy watching. I just finished the series about 15 minutes ago, so it hasn't had time to play on my mind yet, but it's going to take a toll on me. I think I need to give up on watching anime and TV series, because it's clear that there aren't any gay focused series that have a nice ending and aren't going to traumatise me.

On a less depressive note, it's funny to think that, since Ash's death was revenge for Shorter's, if Shorter had lived so would Ash. Would Shorter had lived if he'd gone with Ash in los Angeles? Who's to say? That's the butterfly effect for you."
