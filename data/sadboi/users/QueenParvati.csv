survivor,fqsc6rf,t1_fqsbl56,1589603444.0,"She was not bitter at all toward Michele - she said she loves her, but doesn’t know if she can vote for her because she only played a few days with her and she was on the wrong side of the vote for so much of the game.

Natalie and Parv never met through fitness, I don’t know where you’re getting that from. Parv did interview her, but that’s it...that pales in comparison to playing on  another season together and being aligned, being someone’s best friend, or being someone’s literal neighbor. And also, Tony won by a huge margin and Parv likely knew this...imo, her vote is very likely an attempt to give her friend 2nd place. If it were closer, I could definitely see her voting for Tony.

Again, huge difference here."
survivor,fqsawvz,t1_fqsa1vo,1589602538.0,"Completely disagree. The whole debate about Parv vs Sandra rests on Sandra having PREGAME, real life friends on the jury - she played with Rupert, was best friends with Courtney, and was literally neighbors with Candice. Parv also had pregame enemies in Amanda and Candice.

Parvati this season, on the other hand, made an in-game bond with Natalie whom she had never even met before. There’s a huge difference."
survivor,fqs9nmt,t1_fqs9ebm,1589601674.0,This.
survivor,fqs8hb0,t1_fqs61in,1589600899.0,"When people don’t vote for Parvati even though she clearly played the best game: “That’s the game! The jury votes for whoever they want to vote for.”

When Parvati votes for her friend Natalie: “WTF how COULD she not vote for the best player?!?”

🙄🙄🙄"
survivor,fqs8b3n,t1_fqs7z91,1589600789.0,"I don’t think that’s the case. Watch her jury speaks video. She gives Tony a ton of credit and says that Natalie played horribly the first day. Her vote ultimately came down to wanting to give $2M to her friend, just as Tyson’s did. It could also definitely be the case that she knew Tony was winning and wanted to throw a vote to her friend so she got 2nd place instead of 3rd."
survivor,fqs6lk2,t1_fqs4x91,1589599682.0,"I wholeheartedly agree with that. But it’s not the players fault. Don’t blame the players, blame the twist.

Tony was able to get Rob, Ethan and Parv to appreciate his game despite never meeting him in game. Sarah wasn’t. That’s all it comes down to.

They’re not bad people because they thought Tony played a better game."
survivor,fqryxm9,t1_fqrxdn5,1589594879.0,"Totally agree. This sub is super reactionary. The one thing we can say with confidence is that Parv, Rob, Sandra will always be legends. Recency bias will always play a thing, but no one will ever be able to take that away from them. Think that’s part of the reason people feel the need to call Parv a “mean girl,” Rob “sexist” and Sandra “a quitter.”

Haters gonna hate, legends will stay legends ❤️"
survivor,fqrwdid,t1_fqrtg8s,1589593309.0,"We don’t know what people said. Sarah didn’t say Parv was trashing her, just that she was talking her game down.

She’s allowed not to like her game, you know? And she’s allowed to talk about it with other jurors. It happens every season.

Honestly it kinda feels like Sarah just expected Parv and Rob to vote for her over Tony/Michele...which is unfair given that Tony and Michele played strong games themselves. They don’t owe her a jury vote (especially Parv who never met her). The point of Survivor is to *earn* those jury votes.

Michele said it best and Sarah refused to listen - perception is reality."
survivor,fqrvz6u,t1_fqrvont,1589593062.0,"Haha thank you! I know people can find it annoying (and I get it), but I just love her and am super passionate about her as a Survivor player and a person. People talking about her in interviews makes me sad, especially when she hasn’t gotten the chance to defend herself.

I know she can tweet/post on insta, but that’s never been something she does. People say she’s a mean girl, but she always stays above the drama."

And, again, Parv and Rob are allowed to talk about Sarah’s game in a negative light. The goal of the game is to get people to like you and appreciate your game - if Parv and Rob didn’t, that’s on Sarah."
survivor,fqrsaul,t1_fqrrqx7,1589590839.0,Yeah but Kass deleted that tweet because she didn’t see Parv’s precious tweet where she called Ben’s idol finding “super suspect”
survivor,fqrreob,t1_fqrpk1i,1589590299.0,"Parvati tweeted and said that “It’s super suspicious that Ben was finding so many idols.” She then followed it up with “regardless, we can’t blame him for putting in work to find him”

Kass only saw her second tweet and then tweeted her saying “my wish for you is to stop sucking so much CBS cock.” She then deleted after she realized Parv actually was calling Ben out."

survivor,fqrnkpn,t1_fqrjiwc,1589587995.0,"I’ll post it, because I think people should listen to it themselves. OP is paraphrasing, and Sarah’s comments about Parv in particular weren’t as bad as depicted in this post:

survivor,fqrn5m0,t1_fqrkcpe,1589587749.0,"This. The scene where this is most illuminated is when Michele straight up tells Sarah she will lose in the end and Sarah rolls her eyes and mocks Michele behind her back.

These players are allowed to not like Sarah’s game. To claim they’re sexist or “just jealous” is so unfair. Survivor is about making people want to vote for you. I know this sub currently won’t like to hear this, but if Sarah didn’t do that, it’s on her."
survivor,fqrk4dl,t1_fqrjazu,1589585966.0,"This couldn’t be further from the truth. Watch the ponderosa videos - Parv gets along with literally everyone. So many people called her their #1/best friend this season. A few people saying that Parv is a “mean girl” shouldn’t outweigh the thousands of others who say she’s incredibly charming and sweet. Also, it’s no coincidence that every single villain except for Courtney voted for Parv to win - these are the people who spent the most time with Parv and Sandra...the heroes just isolated her. Don’t wanna get into that, but I’m just saying.

She’s allowed to not like Sarah’s game. That doesn’t make her a bad person.

If this sub can’t see that then I’m honestly disappointed.

Also, I’ll just leave this here, as I think it really proves what a great person she really is: https://www.reddit.com/r/survivor/comments/g2ldaf/yet_another_reason_to_like_parvati_shallow/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf"

survivor,fqrj92r,t1_fqrievi,1589585459.0,"Parvati gave a ton of credit to Tony, who she never met in the game, and Natalie who was her best friend. Michele wasn’t on the right side of the vote at all postmerge, that was Parv’s point.

Also, she’s allowed not to like Sarah’s game and think Tony played better. As Michele tried to tell Sarah, perception is reality. To say that Parvati is “just jealous” is silly and childish...and to relate it to sexism makes no sense.

I really don’t see how people are holding this against Parv. Obviously I’m biased, but Sarah’s argument is so confusing."
survivor,fqras1z,t1_fqqkr30,1589580783.0,"Well Parv was simply swapscrewed. Had she made merge she meets up with her real life friend Sophie, her ally Denise. Kim who 100% would have worked with her, and Tyson. Plus the whole lions vs hyena arc starts and I feel like she has a huge shot of running shit with those four.

They’ve never shied away from editing her cutthroat nature as a player before...it just seems so weird. Maybe they wanted to give more credit to Rob?"
survivor,fqouxvd,t1_fqonw1g,1589525627.0,"Parv and Natalie have both said that Natalie played the first day horribly - apparently she was throwing *everyone’s* names out. Plus she was unbreakable with Jeremy and Michele so it makes sense to take her out.

As for Danni, it seemed like the new schoolers were super paranoid about an old school alliance. I think that’s why Parv chose to throw her under the bus and ultimately sacrifice her. After all, she was the one who tried going after Rob on day 1.

I agree, though. I feel bad for Danni. Originally I thought she was blaming Parv for her bad edit, but in reality she’s giving her props and just wishes they had shown her side of things more."
