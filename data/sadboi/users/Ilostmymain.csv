This obviously isn't typical but it worked for us. My advice is to not take advice from people not in your situation. When I was younger I use to really let it get to me when people would make nasty remarks about it not possibly working out. I wish I spent less time worrying about whether or not we would last and enjoyed myself a little more. It worked for us, with no crazy relationship ending drama in-between. Me and my bf were able to visit each other pretty often tho, which made a huge difference. If you guys want it to work, you'll put in the steps to make it work."

I don't collect fat on my mid section, it mostly goes to my butt/thigh and chest area. When I'm 125lbs people usually ping me as muuch lighter as well. At one point I was at 98lbs(which isn't damaging at my height) and I had a lot of people wondering about my health, which was a bit irritating but it is what it is. Oddly enough at that size my arms looked quiet boney while the flesh on my hips/thighs stayed."

Kibbe,fqro6kj,t3_gkimqg,1589588360.0,"For most of my youth I tried really hard to dress in a tomboy style, which of course never worked for me. Think all oversized tops + short shorts + straight leg jeans. Never understood why, literally just thought I was fat despite being ity bity. It was only when I ditched that and went full femme did I start feeling comfortable with myself. Full femme was 100% the way to go. 

Most skirts look amazing on me aside from boxy A-lines. Most of my issues with clothing come from blouses, but they're an easy fix. Either I upcycle it myself or I tie a knot at the waist to give it a little emphasis. 

For pants I buy oversized highwaisted jeans in a girlfriend/boyfriend, wear a belt and cuff the hem to my ankles. 

Dainty jewelry also makes all the difference, but I feel this goes for any type. I love the look of ring layering and I've seen a lot of gamines/naturals irl pull this off as well.

Don't get me started on the full face of make-up trend. Ugh, I love the artistry behind it and it looks good on so many people, but it just isn't for me. I tried so hard to force it to work for years but all it did was make me look clownish. My more glamorous family members were more than happy to inherit my stash."

They had their use when I was an acne covered teen but the way my skin is nowadays hardly requires the same upkeep. I didn't realize how manipulating advertising was until I took a class on it.

VintageFashion,fqocphx,t3_gk0mxt,1589512314.0,"The dress she's wearing in the picture helps create the illusion of her impossibly small waist. The wideness of her skirt plus the drape in the sleeves create a large point of contrast at her waist. It's possible to recreate this look with a corset a few inches off from your natural waist if you keep the clothing thing in mind. Corsets don't have to be uncomfortable if you buy a well made one and don't go down more than 5 inches. Speaking from experience.

AskReddit,fotp9nb,t3_g9adyu,1588061284.0,"My parents were part of the Pentecostal Christian cult from when I was 4-6. Despite being so young I have a few memories from that time that really stuck out. I was raised believing makeup, nail polish and anything that made you stood out was evil. This one older lady in the church with the longest gorgeous silver hair got bullied into cutting it all off by the other women in the church. I always felt like this was my fault because they only started picking on her when I started complimenting her on it. They even started trying to coaching me to tell her I thought her hair was ugly. Eventually my parents left because the church started trying to get all its members to cut off family members and friends who were not part of the church. Still, I struggled a lot with my feminity growing up because of this.

Edit: I also pissed off a bunch of people by asking if Dumbledore was god. I wasn't suppose to read anything with witchcraft in it but my aunt would read Harry Potter to me anyway.

Edit: so I talked to my mom about her short lived cult days and she told me a bunch of them ended up selling all their belongings because of the 2000 rapture. They ended up majorly screwed over when nothing happened."
