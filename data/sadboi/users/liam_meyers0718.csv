ftm,fbg23xm,t3_ed0xca,1576830516.0,One of the best ways I’ve found to build my confidence and keep it up is talking to other guys that are transitioning or have transitioned and seeing their progress.  My Instagram feed is basically updates on transition status or guys that put themselves out there to answer basically any question you might have.  I guess what I’m saying is being a part of the community and feeding off others confidence can help yours.

I came out 2.5 years ago, completely socially transitioned, changed my name and have been on t for 1.5 months and my family still doesn’t get it right.  If you don’t keep correcting them they may just think they won and it’s ok to use the wrong pronouns or even the wrong name.  Be annoying, be very annoying."
ptsd,fbg0ki0,t3_ecy80g,1576828431.0,"Dude, I’m sorry.  I’m 32 and have ptsd from a really bad abusive relationship.  I ignored it for a long time until I couldn’t anymore and ended up in a psych ward.  Therapy definitely helped, and finding other people I could relate to helped so it’s definitely worth it.

And seeking the help you need doesn’t make you weak or a pussy, it actually makes you stronger because you’re willing to face the problem instead of run from it.  It may feel like the world is against you at times but it gets better and you get better."

Christmas is supposed to be a time for giving and helping each other and if it’s important to you and someone you care about of course you should make sure they aren’t alone and have support.  I hope the best for both of you.
