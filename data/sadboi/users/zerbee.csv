kratom,fqa8om3,t3_getogm,1589214790.0,"Something similar started happening to me recently too! I have been using kratom on and off as needed for several years, mostly for severe menstrual or sciatica pain. But certainly not daily, maybe averages out to once or twice a month. But only the last 3 or 4 times, which were all this year, have I been having side effects. Itchy skin and nausea/vomiting. I haven't changed anything about the types or brands. Happens with both capsules (I take 7.5 g worth) and concentrate shots. Never even had mild side effects prior. Yesterday was the absolute worst, so much that I don't think I ever want to use it again. Any ideas why I wouldn't have had issues before, but now I am?"
Anxiety,fp2f4vf,t3_gaarcc,1588260686.0,"When my anxiety is at its worst, it makes me cry uncontrollably and makes me irrational in my thoughts. Luckily, I am usually aware I am having irrational thoughts, so if possible ,I just try to stop what I'm doing until I calm down enough to function. It may take hours. I'm very lucky that I work from home and can usually flex out my time like that. 
When my anxiety is mild to moderate, I have the urge to evacuate my bowels. Even when there's nothing left to evacuate. I think I'm done, clean up, try to go back to what I was doing before, and then immediately have the urge to go again. I've used an entire roll of TP in a single day before. I can often identify what I had in my last meal because it didn't have a chance to fully digest."

FLMedicalTrees,fnrznyr,t1_fnmjsxb,1587207732.0,"Same thing with the New Port Richey Trulieve location on Friday. I placed my order online at 7:46 AM. It was confirmed as ready for pickup by 10:40 AM. I couldn't pick it up until after work, and checked in at the store at 6:40 PM. The employee estimated the wait to be 1.5 hrs. The store closed 10 minutes prior to that, mind you. But they assured anyone with a reservation would get seen if they were already there. I finally got the text to return inside at 8:32 PM. But apparently it was because they texted everyone then because technically anyone was supposed to be inside the building by 8 when they closed. I continued to wait inside maybe 10 more minutes, and by the time I was called into the back room, I wasted no time asking about add-ons like I normally to. Paid right away and walked out by 8:49 PM. I did get a free lighter though. They seemed to be way less thorough about social distancing measures than they did when I went earlier in the week, but I think they were just trying to get everyone taken care of. Every customer in that place was very upset and not shy about expressing it. They employees were doing they best they could, not their fault. Just a very frustrating experience. I should have learned my lesson to stay away on Friday evenings, especially when a ""promotion"" is going on."

plantclinic,fmwoz9m,t1_fmwfeme,1586450472.0,"It appears like it might be compact just due to time, but I'm not sure how to tell. I last repotted maybe 2 years ago. Less than 5 years. As for nutrients / fertilizer, I occasionally water it with a miracle grow solution. Other times I've given it Epsom salts. I appreciate your feedback, I'm so terrible with plants and understanding their needs, and interpreting the symptoms."
plantclinic,fmw90br,t1_fmvwsrc,1586442065.0,"Thank you for the reply. No, I have not. If there has been any over watering, it would only have been recently after I had concerns of underwatering, after it was already having issues. My main concern about checking the roots or repotting, is I know more branches and leaves will fall off just from handling it... but I suppose if they fall off that easily they are already a lost cause, right?
I have heard soil for succulents can be good for them, so I'm thinking of switching to that or adding it in (I already have a large bag)."
plantclinic,fmvv1bi,t3_fxqt4n,1586431884.0,"Have had this plant for over 20 years in Florida. Recently, lots of branches started turning yellow and falling off. We went through a bit of a dry spell compared to usual recently. The only thing I can immediately point to is being too dry, but aside from the yellowing, doesn't appear dry. Not sure if it's some unseen pest, or an issue with the pot or the soil. It was inside of a screened in patio until yesterday morning. I started having concerns if there is too little sunlight there, so I moved it to the screened in pool cage. The moving process as well as exposure to the open winds in the last 24 hrs caused another 3 large branches to fall off. Have been misting the plant with a water bottle the last couple of days too. How can bring this back to life?"

Had to ask 5+ people and wait in different 2-3 locations for over 2 hours before we could figure it out. The pick-up ride back was also a bit unpredictable, waited over an hour at least.
