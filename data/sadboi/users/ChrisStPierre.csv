BPD,f4kbkhf,t3_dktvds,1571644251.0,"Your feelings in a relationship are legitimate, and you owe it to both yourself and your partner to express your feelings in an effective way and have your needs met. You also owe it to your partner to listen to and validate your partners feelings. 

If you are both doing that, there is a upward trend in your relationship, and plenty of personal growth for both of you, then the relationship isn’t toxic. 

If you are both separately in therapy and seriously engaged then it is probably more helpful to consider how effective individual interactions were and then learn from them than to label either of you as toxic."

NoStupidQuestions,f26k2lb,t3_dc8bmr,1570014094.0,"Negative externalities are not properly included in the costs of good. IE: electric cars result in less large gas trucks driving on and destroying roads, so the roads need to be fixed less often (paid for by taxes). But those savings are not included in the cost of the car. Gas trucks or has can be taxed, but as a whole the actual short-term economic cost of environmental destruction is actually much more than it seems.

My point is that even just fairly taking into account negative externalities would have a significant impact on the problem. We don’t do it because it’s not popular. It’s not popular because people don’t think like economists. It’s too complicated. And the same people that care about climate change still wouldn’t support something that actually makes sense like a negative externality tax, because it seems unrelated and makes something cost more.

People like subsidies because it makes something seem cheaper, like subsidized electric cars. But it just seems like good-will rather than a methodical approach, doesn’t it?"

Otherwise for software development VScode is great."
cscareerquestions,f26c7a4,t3_dc1006,1570002688.0,"Although Python is very useful in many different domains, C++ is a great first language. The reason I say that is because as a low-level language, learning it teaches you a few things about how a computer language works. So you’ll learn about data structures, Big(O), and other computer science concepts that will help you with other programming languages later."
