SuicideWatch,f7ebj90,t1_f7da38p,1573653174.0,"Yeah, I know the struggle.  :(   I'm glad to hear that your not feeling like harming yourself.    Keep your family (both human and furry) close!  :)"
depression,f7cml37,t3_dveym0,1573595542.0,"Yes.

There can be times when things are going along fine, I'm having a good day and then, boom!  The slightest thing goes wrong.

Sometimes I just let it go.  But other times, it sends me off into an episode that can last for days.  And I don't have any rhyme or reason why sometimes it's one way and sometimes the other."
SuicideWatch,f7cmdua,t3_dum7no,1573595424.0,"Hi!  


I just wanted to follow up and see how you're doing."
depression,f79b2vl,t3_dusy2i,1573505061.0,"I can relate as well.  I'm feeling miserable right now, despite having family members who love me, a good job and relatively good health.  It's very frustrating."
SuicideWatch,f79ao6t,t3_dum7no,1573504905.0,"Your kids may not need you for financial support or to feed them anymore, but that doesn't necessarily mean that they don't need you in their lives.  I still needed my Mom in my life when she passed away (not suicide), and I was 45 at the time.  She wasn't giving us financial support, and in her physical condition, she couldn't do things for us, but she was there for us whenever we needed moral support, a laugh or even just a good cry.  


I hope things get better for you soon.  Cherish your family, and cherish  your fur babies (especially Mr. Spock!)."

I’m afraid traveling (let alone buying a vacation home) is out.  We’re not starving, but finances aren’t exactly loose either..,

As for a new activity... it’s not that I’m bored with my hobby - I want to peruse it.  I just don’t seem to have the energy or drive to do that, let alone start something new.  :("
depression,f6juemx,t1_f6jtawj,1572900369.0,"No.  For one, they’re not interested in my hobbies.  For another, I’m just so depressed that I don’t have the energy to do them anyway.

My problem isn’t that I regret what I’m doing.  It’s just that I’m too depressed to do or care about anything."
depression,f6jss92,t1_f6jrjbd,1572899674.0,"Sadly, I just don’t have the energy to do anything... even things I want to do."
