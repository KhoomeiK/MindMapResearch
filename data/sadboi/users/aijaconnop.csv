Dissociation,fllcql2,t3_fpai9r,1585257847.0,"Me too, last year I had heavy derealization for a month straight and at night usually I could hear voices but they were more loud thoughts I couldn't Controll and it was just nonsense words or I once had a conversation with my friends voice in my head. I also hallucinated a lot of shadow people watching me sleep but I have not seen then since the end of last year."

mentalhealth,esgrr2x,t3_c7p672,1561963754.0,"I get how you feel, I don't know why you're going  it could be harder but I'd suggest try ways to mentally prepare yourself maybe talk to a friend you're comfortable with or a pet or even hell a tree outside, go over the things you want to mention and anything else. Try some relaxing activities then and maybe tea before you go. It might not help the crying situation completely but it should calm your nerves a bit before"

mentalillness,erujn31,t3_c40sw2,1561283792.0,Like derealization? If its the first time that's normal about 50% of the population will experience it but if it becomes persistent and or distressing try bringing up dpdr to a therapist especially if you've been through trauma. I myself have it and I've been derealuzed for almost a month now it's worse when I'm outside and sometimes separates me from reality
