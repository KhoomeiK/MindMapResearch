Just hang in there, and when you're legally able, break away and never look back"
linuxmasterrace,flsgi6f,t3_fqno7d,1585441598.0,"HARHAR! If you think Gentoo is a frustrating experience, Wait till you start down the LFS hole! 

Don't get me wrong: LFS is fun! but if you want to do anything useful with it, there are some hard questions you will need to think on. Simply going through the ritual (satanic?) of Adjusting, Configuring, Making, Installing, ""Crap! I broke something somewhere!"", Re-Adjusting, Re-Configure, Re-Making, Re-installing, etc, etc will blow your mind into something completely in-decent."

SuicideWatch,fa8e89t,t3_e7z8sm,1575845064.0,"Hey there, 

We all feel that way: the emotional self says to end it all... the heartache is so painful, but the mind wants to ""stiff upper lip"" and keep soldiering on. 

&#x200B;

The truth of it is, you are better off not taking your own life: You are married, and you are implying that you love your wife (both things are very positive), you have a job, and haven't just thrown your money away (also positive). 

&#x200B;

It sounds like your brain is telling you that the cost of ending it is too high, and that life is a better option. 

&#x200B;

The only real remedy I know of is to talk to others...to KEEP communicating with other people, and if you need an ear to listen to, please don't hestiate to contact me"

As someone who had his parents say very similar things, all I can tell you is that it really, REALLY hurts: you do your best to reach out and do the right thing...and parents can be the most cruel.

let us here on this thread encourage you, and listen to you. 

if you need help, don't ever stop reaching out! You are more than welcome here"

It sounds like you've hit rock-bottom. Everyone on this thread has been very helpful and respectful. Maybe you just need to be here on reddit (as odd as that sounds) and listen to other people... we all experience those feelings and thoughts. 

&#x200B;

Don't give in yet - relax and let others encourage you, starting with me: You made the right call getting on here, venting your mind. You made the RIGHT choice: you have created an opportunity for yourself, and this can be the start of more opportunities!

You have done well, and all of us are here to help"

SuicideWatch,fa8b945,t1_f9wg7pa,1575843863.0,"Also, I thought I would touch on the Up bringing... I used to think that it was all my parent's fault in that regard, but I began to realize some months ago that my brother also lived through the same life that I did (we were both not in public school, and never had a formal education... I actually taught him arithmetic). However he has been able to establish a family, has a great business (he works for himself), and he has always been 1000 times better at being stable and well adjusted. So, I concluded it was me, and it is  to an extent: nature coupled with nurture .

I love the problem solving you have offered, and if you ever want to swap book titles, I also have a few that have helped me get this far"

and There is a tid-bit in there about how Society uses certain structures to maintain a cohesive society...and I can see how that might apply to those of us who ""feel different"" (the Spectrum, and those undiagnosed -but fee isolated). 

I think that is a flooring concept: that the structures society as an organism needs to function would maybe be fundamentally....NOT optimal for non-conforming members...."
