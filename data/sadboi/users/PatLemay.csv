Now I understand the will to want to know what upsets the one you love.  It's a natural reaction.  You want to protect him, but you feel you need to know what's going on.  Maybe you want him to feel that he can tell you anything and you pushed a bit too far in that direction.  And you seem insecure, so from a personal point of view, you probably wanted to make sure you were not the reason for his trouble.

Maybe next time, you can let him tell you what he feels at his own pace.  Maybe he was too upset to talk and he felt things would not go out well.  Maybe he wanted to take whatever was on his mind away for a few seconds by talking to you.  I feel the best way, even tho it's not easy, is to let him come to you when he's ready.  The fact he called you is a sign he does, so make yourself open, you can even tell him that if there is anything, you will let him come to you at his own rythme.  He will see that the door is open and he will walk through it if he wants to.

Don't beat yourself up. It will do no good.  Visualise how the same situation could occur next time.

adhd_anxiety,fevzsed,t1_fev9l1u,1579403545.0,"It's probably different for everybody, but what worked for me is the creation of small habits and to congratulate myself everytime I would do them.

First thing in the morning, before doing anything else, drink water. I have a bottle of water next to my bed so that's an easy one. One sip, then ""yeah me, I did it!"" After a few days, I added another habit. I decided to meditate 10 minutes before getting up. Again, after each meditations, congratulations are required. Than make my bed. Then stretch. Then have a good breakfast. Then clean up a bit before leaving for work.

The app ""Fabulous"" helps a great deal.

Basically, you train yourself to do stuff that make you proud. Even if it's little things most people would consider basic. Fuck others. This is between you and you. Your brain will love that feeling of self-congratulation, even if it feels weird at first. We are conditionned on humility and self-loathing. You will want more and more.

Another thing is to be kind with yourself. I use to curse at myself everytime I would forget something. And since it would happen many times a day, it was a lot of self-hate.

Talk to yourself (yes, out loud when you can) as if you were your best friend. Your best friend forgets his keys and someone tells him/her he's stupid. You would intervene and defend him/her. That's what you need to do with yourself. Everytime I called myself stupid, I would correct myself. ""no no no no, I'm not stupid, I just forgot, it's ok, it happens. No worries"" I used to be my worst enemy. I now do everything I can to be my best friend. And believe me, self-hate takes a lot of brain space. When you cut it out, you will realise you forget less stuff.

You need to see your worth. You need to remind yourself of your worth. When I meditate, my mentra is mostly ""I am valid"" or a similar positive formula.

Force yourself to love yourself. Fake it till you believe it if you have to. You'll get used to it and you'll end up loving it.

adhd_anxiety,fdeucy0,t3_el0346,1578346785.0,"Ok, I will talk about personnal history with the hope it applies to you (please excuse my English, French is my native language).One of the reasons I used to be such a procrastinator (and thus always be late cause I would never do the stuff I needed to do) is that my brain was always spinning so fast and I had to numb it to give it a rest.  While numbing it, I would not see time go by and would end up late.

I realised in therapy that I did so because I had a huge self-esteem problem, I did not consider myself worthy.  When I did not numb my brain, my thoughts would automatically go to conflicts I had that I felt confrmed my un-worthyness (is that even a word?  Anyway, you get the point).  I realised after a while that I had to be able to live with myself.  To be able to spend time with my brain idle without becoming angry or sad.

I've developped a few ways to be able to do that (with readings and advices from friends).

\- Be kind to yourself.  I used to curse at myself everytime I would forget something (or someone), or didn't do something I was supposed to do.  Since it happened everyday, it was a lot of curses thrown at me by myself.  It's terrible for one's self esteem...You have to picture yourself as your best friend and react as if everything you did ""wrong"" happened to your best buddy.  What would you say to him/her?  How would you make him/her feel better.  You have to become your best friend.  Talk to yourself (yes, out loud), encourage yourself.  You forget your keys and lock yourself out?  ""Stupid me"", you will be tempted to say.  If you do, correct yourself ""I'm not stupid, I just forgot my keys, that's all"".  Do as you would if someone dissed your best friend in front of you.  You would correct them.  Rightly so.  Remember, self-loathing takes a shitload of brain-space.  When you start to love yourself more, that space will free itself and there should be less and less forgetting/procrastination.  It's hard and it takes time, but damn is it worth it!

&#x200B;

\- Validate yourself.  Like I said before, you have to keep a constant conversation with yourself.  I meditate 10min every morning and most of what I repeat in my head as I do is ""I am valid"" ""I am worthy"".  You have to see your worth.  Expose your qualities.  Make them shinny.  Brag about them to yourself.  Don't be shy, don't judge yourself for forcing you to like yourself.  Remember, you have to become your best friend.  It feels good.  Really, try it.

\- Very important: create habits.  Very small ones at first.  It could be drink water first thing when you wake up.  Prepare for your habit. Get a bottle of water on your nightstand before going to bed.  And when you do drink that sip of water first thing in the morning, (and, I cannot stress this enough) CONGRATULATE YOURSELF.  Be proud of doing it.  I'm dead serious.  Congratulating yourself will create a sensation of happiness that will be linked to that habit.  Your brain will want that to happen again and the habit will be easier to continue.

Once you've done it for a few days in a row, add another small habit.  It could be to make your bed.  Or to stretch.  Or to meditate.  Or eat a good, healthy breakfast. But make sure you do this one habit at a time, for a few days, then add another one.  Start small, be proud and go on.

You will love being proud of yourself.  Without needing the approbation of others.  Nevermind other's approbation.  It's a bonus, but yours is vital for your wellbeing.

And if, for some reasons, you do not do your routine, forgive yourself.  Be kind.  ""It's alright, I'll do it tomorrow.  Hey, look, I did it yesterday!!""  Blaming yourself will create a downward spiral and make things worst.

You are not lazy.  You are not stupid.  You are a great human being that has to deal with society's stupid rules.  But you will get there :)

I hope this helps!"

Imagine your best friend came to you and said exactly what you just said.

How would you react?  What would you tell him/her? 

Start treating yourself like a best friend.  Be kind to yourself.  Self-loathing takes a shitload of space in your head. And energy. Once you free that space by being forgetful and nice to you and your flaws, things will start improving.

I know it's a second nature to be mad at yourself.  You've probably been like that for so long.  Just try this, every time you diss yourself, out loud or in your head, correct yourself.  Like you would if someone dissed your friend in front of you.
