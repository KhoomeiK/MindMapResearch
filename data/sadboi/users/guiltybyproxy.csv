They're honest and will help you with trades. What to do, what to reject, etc. There are a TON of scammers on this app, so don't be fooled. Don't be afraid to ask advice on a trade, whether you sending it, or you receiving it.

Edit: Collect what you like, CC be damned. The best are the low CC super rares for trading. Some super rares will start with a high CC because of excitement, but will die down when people give up. In the end you'll have a low CC (card count) award that you can keep, or trade for something you like from another person who is willing to give up something rare (or a few things). Don't settle for just 1:1 just because of rarity. If it's in high demand, make sure you get something good in return."

Something like ""Could Dr. Doom be in Phase 4"", instead of ""Dr. Doom Easter egg confirmation he's in phase 4"". 

I follow Cosmic Wonder, but ironically I don't watch his vidoes because the titles seem like click-bait.
