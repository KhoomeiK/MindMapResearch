Also with bipolar you will experience psychotic episodes and delusions of grandeur. These are very abnormal for someone with just bpd. Also the bpd sleep schedule is more stable compared to bipolar. Theyâ€™re similar but there extremes are very distinct :) hope that helps! 

Edit: if you have both, you would exhibit the fear of abandonment factor as well as the other bpd extreme traits of the conditions to be comorbid"
