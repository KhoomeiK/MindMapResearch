I don’t think you’re mean for feeling the way you feel, honestly to me it just sounds like you are overwhelmed emotionally and can’t carry the burden of others on top of your own, so it’s easier to just think that they will be fine. However I think you’re wrong about this. As a person who has a partner who is suicidal, I can say for sure that if I lost him, going on would not come easy, and I honestly don’t think I’d be able to. Probably I’d just end up in a clinic. I know that he thinks that I’d be fine, and that as it is now he is just a burden and doesn’t have a positive impact on my life. He could not be more wrong. He is everything to me, and losing him would crush me. I’m not saying this to make you feel guilty, because I don’t think you should. I just want you to know that people generally are serious when they say they will be devestated. And if you can’t hold onto this life another day for your own sake, maybe try to last one more day for them. Especially your kitty. May I ask if you are getting any sort of treatment?

No one said men didn’t have any issues, but that was not the subject that was being discussed at this moment! I recently saw a study that determined that women suffer from more violent and deadly domestic abuse. The first comment: «What about men, we suffer from domestic violence too.» - The study literally researched which gender  experienced the most severe violence and after going through the statistics for BOTH genders landed on the fact that the women generally have it worse in this case, both for psychological and physical violence.

My SO is suicidal, and i love  him more than anything. The only recommendation I can make is to be there for him, make sure to tell him how much you love him and care about him, and if he can’t return those feelings at the moment, try not to take it personally. When someone is in that much pain, it’s hard to feel anything else. Try to let him know that you will be there no matter what and that he is not alone. That things will get better, and you will be there through everything. I know how horrible it is to watch someone you love suffer so much, but the best thing you can do is just to be there and listen to him.. Just don’t forget to also take care of yourself in all this. If you get beaten down as well, then you can’t be a support for him either, so don’t forget yourself in all this. 
Maybe my recommendation is bad, but it’s hard to know what’s right to do.. It’s just what I have picked up trying to cope these past few months.

depression,evsnku4,t3_cl0x7g,1564751721.0,"I don’t have depression anymore, but I have a chronic illness that causes a lot of the same symptoms, including inability to focus, slow thinking, difficulty speaking. I used to consider myself to be slightly above average when it came to subjects in school, at least my grades were slightly above average. I was never a genius, but now I would definitely be considered below average. I just wanted to say, that it’s not that you’re any less intelligent, your brain might need some more time to get to where it used to be, but you are suffering from an illness that affects you, it’s not you, it’s the illness, and it’s not irreversible damage. You have to give yourself time to heal, and try to accept that for now, this is how it is, but remember that in the future you can get your old self back. You are still in there, even though your body is suffering. You are still there with everything that you were, and when you step out on the other side you will be even stronger! For someone to live through an illness as debilitating as depression it takes a lot of strength, and I am proud of you for fighting it. I wish every single one of you the best of luck. Allow yourself to be ill, it’s not something you chose, and it’s not your fault. It will get better. I’m sorry if I sound insensitive, I know how debilitating depression is. I just wanted to put in my two cents on the matter."
