kratom,f7ggof6,t3_dw2syr,1573703339.0,"I've got several bags of kratom in my collection now that are just sitting there because they cause wobbles, which is what you're describing. Definitely not a good experience. I've found lying down for a short time, eating, and even vomiting have relieved this feeling. 

However I disagree that it's from taking ""too much"", or from the kratom being ""too strong"". My reasoning is that when I take kratom and it causes wobbles it's like wobbles or nothing. I have reduced my dosage when using these batches and felt nothing. Zilch.  I even experimented and took half my normal dosage and upon feeling nothing added a half gram at a time just to be met by the wobbles when I got close to my normal dosage. 

I dont presume to know exactly what it is that causes this. I've heard a lot of ideas over the past few years, but for now I just chalk it up to bunk kratom. The people you buy from are aware of this as well I'm sure. That's why they're offering great deals on quantities of it. If it were indeed ""stronger"" as mentioned in another comment it would cost more, not less. Hopefully as this plant is studied more we will have more answers.

When you hear terms other than wax or concentrate they are generally referring to the consistency of the wax. Shatter is pliable, or breakable like glass (hence the name), crumble is, well, it crumbles into tiny crumbs that you can dab on their own or sprinkle on a bowl.  Sauce is more like an apple sauce consistency. I think you get the idea.

From my limited research (non-legal state), I have found most of these to be pretty similar in effects,  and don't know that I could single one out as being the best.

They all can be dabbed with a rig and torch (or e-nail setup), but I prefer to use my vape. Looks almost just like an ordinary vape for nicotine, so its low profile enough to take on the go...yet packs a hell of a punch! There's very little smell, and what little there is dissipates quickly.

As stated I don't currently have insurance coverage so I will be paying out of pocket. I know I ultimately need to see some type of specialist,  but unfortunately a specialist comes with special pricing that I just can't afford at the moment. Hopefully it wont be a waste of what little money I have seeing the GP doctor.  

I know that I'm making a bigger deal out of this than I have to, but I can't help it! It's very big to me considering the outcome will greatly effect my wellbeing. I certainly can't afford to ""doctor shop"", so its important that I convey the need directly the first time.  

In your opinion should I describe my symptoms and allow the doc to make any and all suggestions,  or do I mention things I've taken before that worked? 

Also would it be better to take one of the lorazepam that I have remaining prior to going so that I can describe my situation somewhat calmly, or would it be best to take nothing so that the doc gets an idea of where I'm at and why I need the medicine?  Just afraid if I choose the latter my anxiety will be so bad I wont be able to properly convey my feelings. And if I take one of them prior to the visit, what if that makes me calm down and  appear as if I dont need it??

If you have never gotten the wobbles you can consider yourself lucky, and if you ever do, you'll have no doubt that's what they are. You sort of described it with the ""blurred vision and light headed"" description.  It's that and more for me though. It's the inability to focus, both mentally, and visually...like it feels as though your eyes are literally ""wobbling"" around in your head.

 Sometimes it feels as though the room is spinning. I also get really light headed and my anxiety goes through the roof.  Few things I've found that helped were eating, throwing up, or lying down. 

Weird thing for me is that it's seemingly so unpredictable. For instance I picked up two different strains from my normal vendor a few months ago because he was out of my normal. They both came highly recommended.  One of them was fine. The other, immediate wobbles. 

A lot of people will say that it's just really strong kratom that is doing this and I'm taking too much.  I can assure you this isn't correct in my situation anyways. I have taken too much before. I get nauseous,  I throw up, end of story. The wobbles are a complete different animal altogether.  

It really sucks when contemplating buying a new strain or purchasing from a different vendor because there is always that inherent risk of getting something that is going to make me miserable. I wouldn't say it's a big risk, but there's I'd say a 10% chance of what I buy causing wobbles. Fortunately there's a 90% chance it won't!  I have several bags of kratom right now that I would rather do without anything than take if that gives you an idea of how unpleasant it is!"

kratom,f0gfkyb,t1_f0gcidn,1568598805.0,"Personally it would depend on the kratom. For me the wobbles dont come from the amount of kratom that I've taken, they come from the type kratom that it is. Don't get me wrong, almost any kratom will make you nauseous once you injest so much plant matter (my limit being about 15 grams), but to me the wobbles are different from nausea associated with over doing it. .  

When a particular strain gives me wobbles, it just does. I can lower my dose to the point where I dont feel it at all, but any significant amount will give me wobbles. It's like wobbles or nothing. 

I wish I knew exactly what causes them, and how to avoid it. I haven't gotten them in a while, but they truly suck. I've heard many theories on what they are, what causes them, etc.. and can honestly say that I dont think they come from the amount of kratom one has taken. Nausea yes, wobbles no.

kratom,f0fyu07,t1_f0ft8tj,1568591080.0,"Glad you got calmed down man. If you need any more help, or just need to talk send me a message. Take care!"
kratom,f0fsgia,t1_f0fqf9v,1568588493.0,"Yeah dude that's exactly how it feels when I have a panic attack.  Not proud to say this but I've been to the er several times genuinely thinking I was having a heart attack, only to find out it's a panic attack. Worst part is knowing that's what it is in the back of you're mind, but still not being able to silence the thoughts that are telling you otherwise!  I know! I relate!  

If it eases your mind, go to the hospital. Honestly though, there's about a 90% chance they're just  going to give you the same meds you already have to calm you down and then send you on your way along with a big fat bill. 

As said before, I would take one of the lorazepam that you have, lie down, and maybe do some breathing exercises. Give the lorazepam around 30-45 mins to work and then reevaluate the situation.  If you still feel that you need to go. Go!"

kratom,f0fonp0,t1_f0fn0uh,1568586782.0,"Yes I have panic attacks with or without kratom. Most kratom reduces my anxiety, but some types actually increase it. In the cases when it reduces my anxiety I can sometimes get away with not taking my lorazepam at all. Most of the time I have both in my system though. I have PTSD and get pretty bad panic attacks."
kratom,f0flwc6,t1_f0fjevr,1568585488.0,"If you have prescribed lorazepam I would say take one....now. No offense,  but I believe this is the exact scenario for which you've been prescribed them for. Panic attacks. I know because I suffer from them as well so I'm not criticizing you. The panic will cause a rise in your blood pressure as well. 

Also I take lorazepam (ativan) daily along with my kratom, and have done so for 3 years with no problems. I'd stay away from the alprazolam (xanax) though,  as those will be a little strong especially in conjunction with the kratom. Hope this helps"
