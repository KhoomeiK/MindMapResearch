The cringiest part was the mother daughter relationship with the daughter spending her childhood emotionally caring for her grown mother. Not surprising that when she finally grows up, her character sucks and just hops from man to man. 100% cringe fest on so many levels and I will probably watch any new seasons they release because I'm a glutton for punishing content."

Or at least, it would have if it worked properly. They had mostly federal clients and due to the government never paying on time and the company living paycheck to paycheck, they stopped paying us for months at a time. It was very fucked up. Several employees were foreign and had to be sponsored, and they were treated the worst. Lots of weird stuff went on there.

This was in addition to resting his penis on my arm rest every time he leaned over me to look at my computer monitor. He was short enough that he lined right up with it and sitting in his presence was an uptight nightmare. He would also adjust himself constantly, also while looking me in the eye. When circumstances boiled up and I finally reported him, he claimed to have an STD that caused discomfort and made him need to adjust frequently. No good reason was given for resting his dick on my arm rest, but at least I didn't lose my job for reporting him. That job was a fucking nightmare."
