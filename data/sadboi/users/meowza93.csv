asktransgender,fov43g1,t1_fotu2hg,1588095055.0,I don't think you're registering what I'm saying.. the trans people I talk to in my life are okay with speaking about things like this which is why I think I'm caught off guard by your reaction. The trans and cis experience are different and that is okay to acknowledge. Does it make trans women less of a woman? No. Most of the trans women I know didn't transition till at least 20 so any opinions I shared here were mirroring off who I've talk to about this.. the reason why I don't think we're vibing in our discussion is that the link provided doesn't have anything to do with my side of the convo (although it is good!). So I just think there's a disconnect in understanding.

asktransgender,fotf6s5,t1_forput3,1588052166.0,"They both have their high points and lows, but specifically men have the privilege of not dealing with misogyny as blatantly as women (of course unless they are feminine or feminists and if course it manifests even if the person is a man.. but it is definitely than femmes, afabs, and women in general). So this person specifically had that privilege and now that she's come out she loses that perk. It's sucks but it's a norm unfortunately. She's very clear in this post that's she's never dealt with it before coming out.."
asktransgender,fotemfc,t1_fos456h,1588051708.0,"Uhh.. I did not say one way was better than the other. Both are tragic but I see that it's been common for any amab folk to not have it at the forefront unless they were feminist or feminine. Yes amabs suffer from misogyny, but it is not in the same way as femmes, trans women or afabs do. Stop trying to compare them, they are different. This person SPECIFICALLY did not notice misogyny before coming out, so it is absolutely fair to say that they've never had to deal with it blatantly like others do until now. Hence where the ""welcome to misogyny"" jab came from. Your last few points just go off the rails for this particular convo and I don't appreciate it, please take that to someone who is actually suggesting the stuff you said."
