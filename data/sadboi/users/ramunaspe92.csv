ferrets,fka1yb0,t1_fk9pcap,1583989713.0,"Couple of tips. Food - best food is raw meat, raw eggs. No vegies, no grains. If you feed it kibble(ferrets must be introduced to raw food at young age or they dont eat it), look for kibble for small kittens. Most of dry food have lots of grain and other harmful stuff. I havent found good dry ferret food so i use food for kittens. I use Akana wild prairie food for kittens. Got recomendations from my vet and so far havent had problems with it. Do not use watter bottles for hamster/rabits, that with mettal bead. Ferrets cant ger enough watter from it. Use simple, heavy bowl, they love to tip it over so it has to be heavy. Make sure ferret has completelly dark space for sleeping."
