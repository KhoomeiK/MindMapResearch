I’m on a priority list for them to call as soon as things start to open back up, but nobody can say for sure when that will be.

I got a prescription for lidocaine to use, and as long as I remembered to apply it an hour before my infusion it was totally painless. Even the one or two times I forgot to apply it, it wasn’t that bad compared to all the other testing and shit. The port is scary looking but ultimately wayyyyy easier than fucking up the veins in your arms every few weeks.

I’m sorry you’re dealing with chemo on top of all the other scariness right now. It sucks. 

I had my hair in a sweet mohawk for a week or two before my first infusion. It’s good to feel like you’re in control of at least one part of your life while you still have it.

Once it starts to come out, I highly recommend going over your whole scalp with a sticky lint roller once or twice a day. It’ll stop it from all coming out on your pillows and shirts and making things itchy with tiny hairs.

I went through TCHP, but I’m still happy to share chemo stories if it’s helpful for you. This is temporary and everything about it is completely awful, but you’ll come out the other side."

It all ties back to my dad getting extremely sick at various points throughout my childhood. He has occasional stomach issues that he mostly has control over now, but when I was a kid he’d have flare ups at least once a year that would involve him vomiting hourly for several days at a time. They always came out of nowhere and he always ended up hospitalized with no real explanation for why it was happening. More than once it was bad enough that my family was afraid he was going to die.

The anxiety, stress, and feelings of helplessness during his episodes all spiraled together to develop this phobia as a young adult. Getting help for other underlying mental health issues has helped a LOT, and I’m mostly functional now. I can go on public transit or go to bars/parties where I know people will be heavily drinking and can manage my stress or intrusive thoughts. That’s a big step forward from where I was a few years ago.

These days my biggest thing is needing to check warnings for movies or tv shows ahead of time.

I was lucky enough to cross paths with a woman who connected me to a part-time, short-term job that was adjacent to my skill set (working backstage in the wardrobe department at a local theater).

Something clicked when I realized “oh, there are people who do this for real as their full-time jobs!”

It took a while to figure out how to pursue it, but I’ve been in this kind of position for almost five years and I am lucky enough to say that I truly love my job. I feel like that’s rare. I’ve loved working in live theater since I was in elementary school, but the freelance aspect scared me off from acting or designing. Working backstage gives me the security of a permanent full-time job with benefits, while having the thrill of a live performance and the constant change of bringing in a new show every few months.

Of course, none of that is really that great at this specific time, since who knows when theaters will be allowed to open?

AskReddit,flpy4tj,t3_fq9hyn,1585372319.0,"I know plenty of people who use “dude” as a gender neutral word, and I used to be one of them! Then I became friends with a few people who specifically expressed that they dislike being called “dude” because it makes them personally uncomfortable. These are friends of mine who were assigned male at birth, but now have realized that they are either women or exist beyond the gender binary. Being called “dude” makes them feel that they are being perceived as male, which is upsetting to them.

So, because these people are my friends and I care about them, I have decided to work towards steering away from “dude” as a gender neutral term. Realistically, there are probably people in my life who are transgender women or non-binary people who were assigned male at birth who I am not aware of, and might feel uncomfortable with that terminology even if they don’t tell me so explicitly.

My go-to alternatives where I might have said “dudes” or “my dudes” have either been “friends” or “folks”, both of which seem to go over pretty well. “Hey everyone” is always good. “Pal” or “buddy” or “my friend” can work in the singular. There’s all kind of shit out there.

Basically, if you know there are people who actively dislike being referred to by a certain term, and there are other options out there, why stick with that one thing? I know most people who use “dude” do so with innocent intentions, but it’s counterproductive to pretend your actions don’t have consequences just because you didn’t intend for them to have said consequences."

I had breast cancer last year, and it's been such a pain finding bras that I can wear post mastectomy/reconstruction. For reference, I wear a 32E in US sizing. The situation is slightly different, but hopefully similar enough that this information can be useful.

For bras specifically meant for surgery recovery, I HIGHLY recommend Marena. Something weird is going on with their website right now and I can't look at the specific products, but keep an eye on [recovery.marena.com](https://recovery.marena.com) when you can. Hopefully it'll get fixed soon. They have a GREAT customer service department and can help you find the right size in whatever bra you need, since the sizing runs a little different than normal US bras. I think this could work for you because their bands run small; I normally wear a 32 band, but bought a 34 band, which still ended up being a little tight. I probably could have gotten away with a 36 band. So even though you normally wear a 28 band, a 32 band might be okay in this brand.

If that doesn't work, or for wire-free options a little further out from the surgery, I recommend Panache sports bras. I love this one: [https://www.figleaves.com/us/panache-sports-molded-non-wired-bra/PA-000672.html](https://www.figleaves.com/us/panache-sports-molded-non-wired-bra/PA-000672.html)

EDIT: To add to this, I would argue that the chaos of the universe in general puts MORE responsibility on individual actions. If someone murdered me, and my family members thought ""oh, it was God's will"", that takes the responsibility off of the person who did the actual murdering. It's ""random"" in the sense that I didn't decide to get killed, and the universe didn't magically make it happen somehow.

You'll be done with this before you know it. For now, just try to rest and take care of yourself. Feel free to message me if you ever want to chat with another young(ish) cancer survivor."
BipolarReddit,ewdup0g,t3_cnp4xv,1565308012.0,"I'm 31, which is honestly kind of a shock to me sometimes because when I was younger I figured I'd probably kill myself before I even made it to 21. But I got this far, and I plan on sticking around!

I was treated for major depression and anxiety for a long long long time. Finally getting the correct diagnosis was an absolute game changer. It took awhile to find the best meds for me, but once my psychiatrist and I figured that out it's been fairly smooth sailing (at least compared to how I used to be). Sometimes I'll face something that would have completely sent me over the edge in the past, and I just think to myself ""oh wow I guess this is how people with normal brains react to situations like this"". It's weird, but good!

I'm married, I have a dog, I live in a cool city, and I love my job.

I've had some bumps in the road recently (breast cancer diagnosis in early 2018), and I can't even imagine how I would have handled it if I wasn't properly medicated and regularly seeing a therapist. It really sucks to feel like my body is out of control now that I finally got my brain under control, but I'm glad that I'm mentally stable enough these days to make it through something as scary as this."

bipolar2,eub9d29,t3_cfikqa,1563642708.0,"I relate to this so hard. I think a lot of it is that most people have a massive misunderstanding of what bipolar actually looks like. I know when my psychiatrist first suggested that I might have bipolar disorder instead of major depressive disorder, I was extremely skeptical because I had a huge misconception of how it presents. After talking to her about it and doing some of my own research, it all sort of clicked for me.  


I was diagnosed six years ago and my parents still can't bring themselves to say the word ""bipolar"" around me. They're fine admitting that I have depression and anxiety, but when I tell them that those aren't the disorders I have they just roll their eyes and ignore it. Listen to the professionals; they actually know what they're looking at and talking about.  


I'm so sorry you're dealing with this!"
