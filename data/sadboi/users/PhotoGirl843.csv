Also, the hills will determine your resources early on until you can get to deep drilling. So Large Hills or Mountainous may have more resources, but be aware that can lead to insect hives. 

I'd suggest something like a temperate forest with Large Hills. If you get a map with no insects, it should give you a decent number of resources without having the harshness of the winters. You may still get heat waves or cold snaps, but the average temperature should be more manageable."

They have a format now that has changed as times has gone on. They find a balance between what works on the channel and what they enjoy playing. I still find them genuine and engaging and I enjoy watching their content. And obviously there are enough people that still do find them entertaining for them to continue posting. 

RE: their faces. They are showing their faces on Instagram and other places, there just isn't really a need for it in videos. It doesn't fit their style of videos so there's no point. They do VR, which obviously shows their faces, so there's that. It's not a thing anymore, really, there just isn't a point to it on their daily videos. 

RE: the streams. They just cannot keep up with the chat or every single comment or donation that comes in. I've only caught a stream once or twice, but it's definitely too much going on to keep up with and not play the game. There are smaller channels that can't even keep up with their chat sometimes so I understand why they do what they do. 

Everyone has different taste. If you don't enjoy their content anymore, then fine don't watch. I've had countless channels I've quit watching in the past because I just didn't enjoy the content anymore, but guess what? I didn't go whining around in different places that I didn't like their stuff anymore. I just unsubbed and moved on. 

TL;DR  - Don't like their stuff? Fine. Don't watch. No point in bitching about it anywhere that you don't like it, just move on. Bitching serves no purpose."
