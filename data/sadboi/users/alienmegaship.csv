freemasonry,fg90p6b,t1_fg8k08y,1580632786.0,"Based on your comment history I’m going to guess you are located in the UK, in the states dress code differs based of jurisdiction. Now I could be wrong and if I am brothers please correct me, but most lodges in the US have a more relaxed dress code. I know my mother lodge requires coat and tie for stated meetings. 

Another point I’d like to point out is this particular lodge has a long history of rail workers with in its membership. So much so, the grand lodge of Florida (again I could be wrong) has approved for them to wear bibs/overalls as accepted lodge attire due to so many members leaving work back in the day and going  to the lodge afterwards."

Wasn’t until much later that I found out a lot of my family and people I had around me growing up were Freemasons or OES. Looking back I was, for lack of better terms, exposed to masonry my entire life and just had a strong calling to join."

freemasonry,ff8c1gg,t3_es0lib,1579672429.0,"I know I’m just a FC but to me I personally take masonry very serious, recently I attended a EA degree and I was getting extremely annoyed by the amount of loud talking back and forth, I understand some talking to be ok sometimes if it’s quick and quiet but multiple people were speaking and I could hear entire conversations from across the lodge during the degree. 

Another thing I saw that night was multiple people pulling out their phones and texting or scrolling through Facebook during the degree, I’m sorry but to me you should be paying attention to the hard work the officers have done to learn this work as well as supporting your newly entered brothers by paying attention no matter how many times you’ve heard it."
