Everybody should love their bodies. I agree with that completely. You're a human being, and you're beautiful. Please don't ever feel ashamed about your body. All humans are beautiful, wonderful creatures. 

My opinion also stands for the complete opposite end of the spectrum, too. There is such thing as too skinny. It's unhealthy to be so skinny you can see all your bones, for instance. It's all about balance. Perfectly balanced, as all things should be. In fact, I'm skinny but I'm not healthy. It's something I'm working on, to become healthier. I have moderately high blood pressure, and that scares me. Luckily my fiancee is perfectly healthy."
PlusSize,fo9gfm4,t3_g6eg1z,1587618818.0,"Communication is key to relationships. Sit down and talk to him about it. 

I'm in a very similar situation with my fiancee. She's not a skinny girl, and I've always dated skinny girls. I don't date them because they're skinny, but because they're attractive. I found my fiancee extremely attractive, and started dating her. 

I don't want to date someone who is overweight because I want to date someone who I can see myself being with until we're much, much older. Like into our 80s and one of my fears is she'll succumb to death well before. 

She knows all of this. She also knows I support her and love her regardless of her weight. That's not my concern, my concern is she'll die much earlier than me. 

I also don't necessarily agree with body positive movement. If you're overweight, you should do your best to lose that weight. Not because overweight is ugly, but for health concerns, mental and physical health. I want my fiancee to be healthy. And luckily she is healthy. No diabetes, no high blood pressure, etc., nothing is wrong with her health. She's just overweight. 

We've talked about it a lot. And she understands where I'm coming from. I want to clarify - I don't mind her being overweight, I just want her to be healthy. Perhaps your boyfriend feels similar? 

She wants to lose weight, thankfully because she agrees with me. She wants to be healthy. She's not doing it to ""be more attractive"", but to be more healthy. 

Unfortunately, it's extremely difficult to lose weight. It's possible, but hard, from an evolutionary point of view. Humans haven't evolved enough to realize we have easy access to food nowadays. 

I will never shame my fiancee for her weight. Never. And she shouldn't be ashamed of it, either. She's absolutely beautiful, and she is the most beautiful person inside, too. 

But to answer your question, in my opinion, no. You're not overreacting. Weight is a very sensitive topic. Everybody wants to be liked for who they are. Talk to him and tell him how you felt by what he said."

nextfuckinglevel,fmyp8pa,t1_fmynewc,1586491832.0,"Definitely start off with NuWho, which is what we Doctor Who fans calls the 2005-present show. Classic Who goes way back. 

There's a couple start on for Doctor Who. 

Season One is good, and it's the season with this episode that everybody is referencing. In my opinion, I loved starting off with Season One. Eccleston is just an incredible doctor. 

Season Four is an okay jump on, too. Probably has the best companion to date, and Council of Geeks agree. Donna Noble is the Doctor's best friend. 

Season Five is another pretty good jump on season as you get a brand new doctor and new companion. So you kind of go over the basics of what Doctor Who is all over again. 

Season Eight is okay. There's still some of the previous companions, but Clara enters the season in the first few episodes. 

The best part of Doctor Who is pre-Jodie. (Season 11-12) because the general consensus is these episodes are pretty bad. Many of what made Doctor Who in NuWho is just gone. I personally like Jodie as the doctor, but many people don't. (mostly because of writing) 

That said, if you want to see where Doctor Who is now, and what it'll be like for seasons you come, start off with Season 11. New doctor and companions, like Season 5, means you'll learn all the basics again.

Also know that Doctor Who goes through ups and downs, and right now it's down. So I highly recommend season 5, for probably the best of NuWho. Become a fan, then watch the rest.  

When I introduce my friends to the show, I start them on season one or season five. Because these are when the show is beyond awesome.

They got the arrest warrant that day and knew I'd be at the court."
AskReddit,fmdxi7l,t1_fmdxcln,1585981256.0,"Right? Same here.

There's more to it but that's the gist. Apparently it's different for state to state. Some states, because of overcrowding in their prisons, their prisoners go to jail. And jail is county or city whereas prison is state or federal."
AskReddit,fmdx9nb,t1_fmdx445,1585981016.0,"Detectives had a warrant for my arrest. 

Felony extortion was the main charge I was facing."
AskReddit,fmdx7pk,t1_fmdwzm7,1585980963.0,Yup. Felony extortion. And a bunch of misdemeanors. But IDK what they are.
AskReddit,fmdx5pr,t1_fmdwycs,1585980905.0,This is true but I never hit the gym.
AskReddit,fmdx49a,t1_fmdwvf1,1585980865.0,Jail is before sentencing. Also jail is for less than a year whereas prison is over a year and for felonies. Basically?
AskReddit,fmdx2kp,t1_fmdwrcn,1585980819.0,Maybe? But I don't think you'd violate for appearing in court. I didn't go up to my fiancee or anything like that.
AskReddit,fmdwzw6,t1_fmdw46a,1585980746.0,"Jail is before sentencing. You go to jail, wait for the jury to sentence you. 

Also jail is for smaller crimes for less than a year. Prison is felonies and longer time. 

At least that's kind of how I understand it from everybody commenting."
AskReddit,fmdwva5,t1_fmdwiij,1585980622.0,"I got nothing back. That's apparently how the bail companies make their money. They keep it, but you only pay 10%."
AskReddit,fmdt7n1,t1_fmdt30u,1585977185.0,Well thank you.
AskReddit,fmdt4wq,t1_fmds48r,1585977120.0,"I don't know. 

I know I paid $2000 to the bail bondsman. And that's it."
AskReddit,fmdt1vw,t1_fmdqd8q,1585977048.0,"No, unfortunately. I wish I could deposit money into his account now. 

Again, bad mental state. Didn't even think about thanking him."
AskReddit,fmdsvhn,t1_fmdssry,1585976897.0,I wouldn't know. I'm very ignorant on the topic. Lol.
AskReddit,fmdsrhz,t1_fmdsot6,1585976798.0,Apparently there's a difference between jail and prison. That's what people are saying.
AskReddit,fmdsl2x,t1_fmdsen4,1585976644.0,"The ask Reddit post is about prison, not jail. So my bad. That's the confusion."
