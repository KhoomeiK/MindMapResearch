Anxiety,flj753y,t1_flh7kg1,1585201084.0,"I can literally say that I feel your struggle lol. I’ve kinda embraced the feeling as odd as it sounds. 

I’ve been taking a lot of vitamin C and I read that having too much could cause heartburn. I stopped taking it two days ago and the heartburn sensation has pretty much gone away completely. Maybe it’s by chance or I just mentally convinced myself that the vitamin C was the problem. Regardless, I feel better. Ever since I started embracing the chest tightness rather than fearing it, I’ve noticed it has reduced by about 50%. Hope you start feeling better! Keep us posted!"
Anxiety,fleefp3,t3_fo6h6w,1585082810.0,"I’ve been having the chest tightness for about 4 weeks now. I’d feel it up in my throat as well. I didn’t have a dry cough but I would cough in hopes of relieving the sensation in my throat. Of course, like many of you I thought I had covid-19. My chest tightness has continued to get worse and now I’m feeling weird spasms near my heart. Also been feeling a burning sensation in my chest. Almost like heartburn. I’ve pretty much scratched off the idea that I have the virus since so much time has passed with none of the symptoms listed. Now I’m just back to thinking I’m having a heart attack LOL

But laughs aside, I’m just reminding myself that this is nothing new that I haven’t felt before. It’s just that during these stressful times it’s making it a bit more difficult since I’m constantly worrying about things I can’t control. I know what I need to do but it’s easier said than done. Power to us all. We can get though it"
China_Flu,flcke7o,t3_fo0kfo,1585034355.0,"It’s all about perspective. We are all in agreement that these are strange times. Scary in fact. Like you, my anxiety had pretty much gone away for a couple years. It’s come back due to the constant stress and worry. What I realized was that I was constantly stressing /worrying about things I couldn’t control. The community spread, spread around the world, and the horror stories that were posted constantly. Since we are in “shelter In place”, I started to restructure my thought process. For this specific situation, it was better for me to think about the smaller picture. As in, my own life. I can control how I protect myself and my family. My home is the safe zone. I can’t speak for anyone else but this helps me. There’s a storm going on but eventually storms pass. Just do what you can to stay safe during the storm and be proud of your efforts."

China_Flu,fktfr3q,t3_fklfsm,1584517790.0,"I think you should process the information from a different perspective. I wouldn’t block yourself out from being up to date. I view reddit as a valuable resource to keep me and my family safe. I’m not going to lie, it can be stressful seeing how bad things are getting but the only way one could dodge an obstacle is if you see it ahead of you first."
China_Flu,fkpv82p,t3_fjy44m,1584420395.0,"There’s so many of us that are in this same boat. My situation is similar in a way that they can’t seem to understand the risks each day brings when they work in a restaurant. Like your situation, they banned dine in but take out is just as much of a risk! It’s a family owned business and my dad works with all his cousins. He knows this is serious and he STILL has no plan of staying home. It’s honestly blowing my mind. I tell him straight up that not only do I care about your well being but you bring whatever you may catch back home to US. I’ve done my part trying to prepare for this. Convinced my parents long ago to buy food, sanitizer, etc. Warned them about the progressing restrictions and shut downs thanks to the data collected around the world and they are thankful for that. They don’t think I’m dramatic anymore. BUT he is so loyal to his job! Ugh 

Keep pushing everyone. I’ll never give up. I will always aim to be one step ahead and will continue educating myself about the situation."
China_Flu,fkjiqc1,t3_fit2p7,1584247167.0,I wore a mask and gloves to BevMo and bought some alcohol. People stare but I walk without a care in the world. What was funny was the fact they didn't even card me. I could have been 14. They'll never know
China_Flu,fkjgt0i,t3_fitsz5,1584245477.0,"Sorry for your loss.  


Just know that you are thinking within reason. Tough times call for leaders that don't get their minds clouded. Like you mentioned, your grandma would have liked a large funeral but most likely not at the cost of many getting sick or worse. Wishing you and your family the best during these tough times."

Coronavirus,fkg4dnk,t3_fialdq,1584149644.0,"Same honestly. Family thought I was being dramatic and Excessive. The day I saw the post of the individual in China mentioning the items that became a most wanted item, I went to go purchase a respectful amount for myself and family. This was a while ago when most thought it’d never leave China. 

Thank you everyone on here."
