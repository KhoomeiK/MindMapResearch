PLEASE READ: https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.usatoday.com/amp/3024648001

“Experts state the second wave was more severe because of genetic mutation, wartime movement and because it was ‘more likely to be accompanied by bacterial pneumonias,’ per the 1991 study.”

“Because of the lack of comprehensive medical records from 1918-20, there is not enough evidence to conclude an accurate number of deaths in any of the waves of the pandemic. Further, the CDC estimates 50 million people died overall in the pandemic, not just in the second wave.”

“...many of these comparisons fail to emphasize the more stark realities of the 1918 pandemic. Less-advanced health care systems and medical technology, the lack of an intergovernmental world health agency and an ongoing world war contributed to it becoming known as the worst pandemic in human history.”

“...influenza was not a reportable disease at the start of the 1918 pandemic, so it was difficult to know whether a person died of pneumonia or pneumonia caused by influenza.”"

socialanxiety,fmkl614,t3_fvtloy,1586158797.0,"So you know how all your conversations with your IRL friends are inside jokes? Talking to people is the same way. Regular conversation is one big inside joke. 

“Hi! How are you? Good. It’s really windy out today! Yeah, I had to wear a jacket for the first time in a while. I like it! Oh, thank you!” Etc. 

This kind of conversation is happening everywhere, in all the cities and in all the states and in all the countries everywhere on Earth people are having these conversations. They are extremely predictable because we have all subconsciously agreed as a society to act a certain way around each other when we first meet. It’s comfortable that way. 

So, you have to get to know this society, you have to learn the inside jokes. The next random person you talk to, just be as simple as possible. Say normal, regular, boring things to them, like how’s your day/weekend? After that person, you’ll go to sleep that night and build a muscle in your brain. Next random person you meet, you’ll say, how’s your day/weekend? and it will come out like butter, you won’t feel tense saying it like the first time. 

Really the thing holding you back is self-esteem. If you’re like me, you were bullied at an early age, or you’ve done a lot of embarrassing things in front of people so you’ve learned to suppress yourself. That I can’t help you with. I fucking hate myself lol. That fear is so fucking terrible, it makes me want to die. It really holds me back personally, and other people treat you like shit for feeling like that. It’s like an invisible steel rod pressing against my chest and skull, not allowing me to do what I want. 

But beyond that, the skill of talking to people is easy. The fears that come up in your body as you talk to someone is the hardest part. The rest of the conversation and interaction is easy. It’s just the getting there and believing you’ll be ok that is hard... which I don’t know how to fucking deal with lol."

trump,fcys5ov,t3_ejfi3h,1578085922.0,"No. That is not what is happening. Adam Schiff responded and agreed that Qasem Soleimani is a threat and that the world would be better off without him. Democrats and others understand the threat of Iran, they simply don’t want to handle it in this way. Simply because one party wants to handle it differently than your party doesn’t mean Iran is not of concern to them.

That is a straw man. Democrats are just as concerned about foreign countries and the balance of power and order as the Republicans, the only difference is that the Republicans tend to be more in favor of military force, that is all. 

The fact is: Democrats do not like how Trump is handing it. That is all. For one, Trump did not consult the house. Two, his recent tweet in all caps suggesting that Iran will “suffer consequences the likes of which few throughout history have ever suffered before,” we believe, is unprofessional and warmongering.

Please do not twist this into “Democrats are against America.” You would like to think that, but that is clearly a straw man. And if you do not know the definition of straw man, here: “an intentionally misrepresented proposition that is set up because it is easier to defeat than an opponent's real argument.”

And while we are at it, in this video from 2011: https://youtu.be/9QdBPP7nMfI you can see that Trump slammed Obama for threatening to wage on Iran... Trump vowed not to start a war, and now he is.

I’d like to know what you think about all of this."
