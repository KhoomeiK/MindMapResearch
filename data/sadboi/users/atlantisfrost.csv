pokemongo,fr2z735,t1_fr2alsv,1589846747.0,Yup. Pokemon Go events are basically the only thing I look forward to right now... but I'm not even sure if I'll play for these next few community days.
photocritique,fr1c8p5,t1_fqzyjq0,1589817175.0,"I kind of like the fact (for the sake of your photo) that someone isn't social distancing properly. It illustrates that there are always a few people who don't follow the rules.

Really nice photo btw. I like that it's in black and white, and the centering of the ""one way"" arrow between the people in line at the counter is a nice touch!"

pkmntcgcollections,fn6d0q3,t3_fzs82v,1586695828.0,"The problem with sorting the cards by type is the pokemon that have 2 different types. So for example, you could have a grass-type phantump in a different section from psychic-type phantump.

I sorted all my bulk cards by pokedex number but I keep them in old Elite Trainer Boxes, so if I pull a new bulbasaur I can just slot it in. I use the dividers that come with the ETBs to divide the different generations. Downside of this storage method is that you don't get to see the cards as you would in a binder. (I keep all my ultra rares, etc sleeved in a binder for that reason.)

Edit: I also use the Pokellector app to catalogue all my cards. It's a bit of work to check off all the cards in your collection, but in the end you can just search by set or pokemon to see what cards you have or still need."
tabletopgamedesign,fn6bwtm,t3_fzr6ep,1586694858.0,"I really like the video! Well done! And the game seems like fun!

I have a bit of feedback about the ending of the video. You at first say that it's appropriate for ages 5 and up and then say it's ""kid friendly"", which to me seems a bit redundant. Maybe you could change those lines to something like ""for heroes both young and old"" and/or ""family friendly"", respectively?

Also, the very last line put me off a bit, how you call people non-super, especially after just saying that heroes of any age can play. I think it might be better to change ""even the non-super can play"" to something like ""so you become super when you play!"" Makes it a bit more positive and enticing?

Anyway, these are sort of nitpicky things, and I really enjoyed the video otherwise!"

I find that Pokemon Go has a similar effect, with daily streak goals and weekly rewards that get you motivated to do something each day. It's especially nice because it encourages you to go outside for a walk when you otherwise might not, which I find helps with depression too."
