EatingDisorders,fmklxwt,t3_fvo5ug,1586159598.0,"For me, eating as much as I felt like I needed has helped a lot. My metabolism was really messed up too. The key is eating enough (of healthy things), and you will also need LOTS of fibre! There were days when I was able to eat like 10 portions of fruits and vegetables. Of course, don't go overboard! The key is balance."

1. How different is it to play on a polish pad or a soft pad? 

2. Are there any step combinations that are difficult to do with these? 

3. Do they come already assembled?

4. Would you recommend it to someone who is quite new to the game?"
