aww,fqqdmsp,t1_fqpiofs,1589563705.0,"My parents bought me an adult pitbull for my birthday, just out of their more traditional training years. The thing would go *apeshit* if you left. She would run around knocking over everything, piss and poop *everywhere*(even if you took her outside before you left..), drag her cage around the house, scream and cry. And this was just the first hour. 

My mom stopped by at a friend's to drop something off, was brought inside for a minute to look at their new cat, when she got back her coffee was thrown across the car and she started ripping up her jacket. We got rid of the dog since it was a nightmare for a middle school student(and by the way, I asked for a cat. Lol), my parents didn't want to change their work schedule to make sure someone was home at all times either. 

Pretty sure the last owner coddled it, realized it could be annoying as an adult, then got rid of her. The owner after me ended up getting rid of her a month later too. How annoying, she was a perfectly good dog otherwise but so incredibly needy, a family of 3 couldn't prevent her from breaking something for even a day. We tried for four months before we gave up since nothing was changing and I was running out of stuff for her to chew.
