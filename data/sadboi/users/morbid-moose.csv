AskReddit,fnrr0cc,t3_g3jc17,1587198306.0,"Recently it has to be 1917. 
I went to go watch that film with a friend a few days after being discharged from the hospital. At that point I had lost motivation in life and dreams I  was passionate about (which in this case was becoming a filmmaker). After being stuck in my bed for days, I finally decided to go since it‚Äôs a film I‚Äôve heard a lot of praise for.

As the film progressed, I started to suddenly be more interested and my eyes would not move from the screen one bit. As I watched, I was amazed at the beautiful story and cinematography and all I could think about was, ‚ÄúOne day I want to make movies like this.‚Äù

Once we finished the film, I went back home and I was wide awake with a smile on my face with
motivation to take better care of myself so I can make films in the future.

That night I was able to sleep peacefully."

Filmmakers,fl2yfe6,t3_fm7eeq,1584763273.0,"I wrote a whole screenplay (only 9 pages, with no concept or ideas beforehand) at 3 in the morning and finished it by 4am. Reason being I had to turn something in, in order to apply for an art scholarship for a specific college. So yeah, it took me a full hour to write one, in a state of delirium trying my best to get it done before the deadline, all while thinking how much of a genius I am that I wrote something that is worthy of getting into Sundance. The next day I woke up and read my quote unquote masterpiece. Reality hit me like a train and my script was...not that great. Anyhoo, to my fellow screenwriters, don‚Äôt try to write a whole screenplay at 3am expecting greatness, just take your time and eventually you‚Äôll end up with something you‚Äôre satisfied with."

bipolar,fifgx7j,t3_f7rkl2,1582389692.0,"This is the exact same problem I have! But it is also one of the reasons why I got hospitalized, so be wary because changing your sleep patterns constantly can really mess you up. Due to not only my mood changes, but also my constant battle with insomnia, I get about an average of 2-4 hours on a bad night and 5-8 hours on a good night. I get mostly bad nights and that has messed up my ability to function during the day and spiraled me into a deep depression EVEN when I had a rush of adrenaline before it. 

Sleep is something you can‚Äôt mess it, just as much as your meds because it has such a big impact on your mood and actions. I recommend you see a doctor if this is a recurring problem. I wish I had and then I wouldn‚Äôt have been in this mess in the first place. Take care and get some sleep!"

bipolar,fgc3lnm,t1_fgbl19j,1580668696.0,"Thank you. When I went to go talk to my counselor about it and showed them the note, they strongly suggested that I go back into treatment (I was hospitalized by the beginning of the school year). I didn‚Äôt want to go in again, due to costs and embarrassment, so instead I will book more therapy appointments and go in to the counselors office if I look like I‚Äôm starting to struggle again. 

Luckily I was able to get out of it thanks to my closest friend and counselors who believed in me and helped me remember that each time I relapsed, I always came back stronger than ever."

bipolar,euacn9o,t3_cfiz0s,1563611435.0,"I took a genetic test around two years ago, and honestly it worked pretty well. Before the test, I was given many different types of medications that were supposed to be on the ‚Äúbad and average‚Äù list (and suffered a lot because of it) After the test, I was put on a medication from the ‚Äúgood‚Äù list and it worked for a while. After a year I‚Äôve felt like the medication hasn‚Äôt been doing it‚Äôs job as well, but I probably just need a higher dosage. I say, if you‚Äôve struggled finding the right medication, then a genetic test might be in your favor."
