Dude people go way above the competitive or slight irritation.

I‚Äôm going to mold it over more. I have the time and ability to knock it out at five months a term and get all the training hours in for the terms requirements. 
Just because I‚Äôm really anxious, not trying to beat a dead horse or whatever, but I literally go at my pace, I say hey I got all this work done for this term, now move me into the next one?

I just got off the phone with Penn Foster and she broke it done saying they do four semesters. 12 months, 15 months, 12 months and then 18 months for the last. That just seems like a long process. She did say that the 2nd and 4th year are hands on in clinic work about two hundreds for each. I kept asking if there is a way to get it done faster and she didn‚Äôt seem to acknowledge that well. 

I will look at these two as well!

I see people saying do nothing because of what they have built or have gone through since, I don‚Äôt agree with that. He‚Äôs being a jerk jerk and I would want to know before continuing my life with someone who may be in love with someone else still and or would easily do that again with someone else. 
You obviously still hold some feelings of wanting to get this off your chest and share it with her. 
She may think your jealous or a liar or may not even message you back at all.  At least she will have the that in her mind and it could shine a light on other jerk things he has done and could save her time and energy on someone who doesn‚Äôt care about her the way he should.  
You never know what good could also come of it, just because it‚Äôs stressful and hurts doesn‚Äôt mean the truth should be withheld. Follow your gut and also remember what if the roles were reversed.
