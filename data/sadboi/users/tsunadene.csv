Every Pisces I’ve met is manipulative and judgmental af, so whenever I hear that they’re lovey dovey and super empathic and amazing great lovers, in my experience it has been the opposite."
BPD,fognu9y,t1_fogmkbb,1587754919.0,"Wow, that is so awful. I wonder if you could file a complaint? You don’t always need proof of that but I’m sure you aren’t the only one she’s done this to. If enough people complain she can lose her job or have some sort of written/verbal warning, because that’s not okay. Don’t work with people who struggle with their mental health if you’re only going to make it worse...that’s so upsetting, I’m sorry. I feel like that would only make BPD symptoms intensify tbh"

You’re talking about drug addicts in the street, sounds like YOUVE never had experience with schizos.

sociopath,fobkkk9,t1_fm1bx8u,1587660761.0,"That’s kinda fucked up of you to exploit mental illnesses that genuinely affect people and their lives. You’re the reason people w/ actual mental illnesses have less validity in what they’re saying, and why people think it’s a cry for help/attention."

Maybe if you actually spoke to him in a kind way and tried to understand why he’s “acting out”, although I bet he is just not complying to you anymore, you would be able to get further with that...I have a narcissistic parent and experienced much of that psychological abuse on a daily basis and she treated my brother with love and kindness even though he was physically abusive to me. She openly tells me now that she lacks empathy. After I stopped allowing her to control me she would get worse and make my life even worse...it caused a lot of the problems I have today and I now have BPD because of it.

She is able to look at it objectively now...so there is hope :) and I know her NPD stems from childhood trauma and abandonment as well, which then trickled down to me and I now have BPD.
