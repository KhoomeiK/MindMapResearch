AmItheAsshole,fgri4t3,t1_fgrho20,1581047390.0,"Yeah, I think that’s what irritates me the most right now. I mean, her financial loss (a BIG loss considering she has no income and hasn’t for years) as I made sure I booked my own room, flight, etc.  I wasn’t toooooo upset when she first texted me this morning but then to not give me any sort of update on how she’s feeling throughout the day so that I could at least modify any plans we had, I found that rather inconsiderate. 

Definitely feeling conflicted, as another person commented that depression and anxiety (mental illnesses in general) are not a one size fits all situation... but also feeling at the end of my rope."
AmItheAsshole,fgrhr7r,t1_fgrh6pg,1581047122.0,"I definitely agree with the one size doesn’t fit all thing. I guess I forgot to add/clarify that she kept saying she’ll get help but there’s no initiative and even when we desperately try our best to be understanding and/or try to get her help. A lot of her other close friends have kinda given up, she is in an on/off relationship with a guy who helped lead her back to hard drugs, beat her up so bad and eventually ended up getting arrested because of assaulting her. She would keep asking me for advice about the situation and knew this was unhealthy for her (and her kid). So I guess it’s a buildup of feeling frustrated about flakiness but also frustrated/sad because she keeps telling me she wants to make it work with this guy, but doesn’t seem to have initiative to do anything and get some kind of help. 

I guess I’ll try to still be supportive of her in other ways, not cut off the friendship... I’m just really disappointed in all this."
