It's not fair for some supports and tanks who try really hard to not let the team carry die whilst trying to not last hit the kill or die themselves. The carries just rely on the tanks and supports to keep them alive most of the time and gets the kills without getting flamed of ks. This is the sole reason I hate playing tank and support. This also applies to split pushers who get flamed for not joining the fight that they are more likely to win without me and get wiped out.
