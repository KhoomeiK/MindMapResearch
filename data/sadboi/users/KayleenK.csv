SuicideWatch,f8pu9mf,t3_e1je3b,1574707385.0,"Honestly it’s not the thought of what people will feel after that stops me. It’s the thought of what my cats would go through if I just vanished one day. Another big thing that stops me is the fear of failing again, I have had a number of failed attempts and the time it sent me to the hospital felt even more like living hell than life already does."

SuicideWatch,f6ehotp,t1_f6egis9,1572804191.0,I don’t blame you there then. I’m also really bad at confrontation and have always tried my hardest to keep my struggles private but that doesn’t seem to work well because everything eventually ends up boiling over. I’m really sorry that you actually want to reach out for help but they won’t take you seriously.

depression,f5t96t5,t3_dp0b6e,1572453214.0,"I’m the same way. I think during the day work can keep my mind occupied/distracted but as soon as I come home it all comes rushing to the front of my mind. I’ve been told to try to do something to distract myself but like you said, I just can’t find the motivation at that point to do it. Days off are the worst for me, I have to try to make plans ahead of time to try to keep myself busy but the more I plan out the more overwhelmed I end up getting and then I just end up wanting to cancel any plans I made."

I’ll have a good period, usually doesn’t last more than two months though, but then something will happen or sometimes I can’t even figure out the cause, but things will turn to shit. When it happens I feel like it hurts worse because of the good times, like they were a trap or a distraction. Other times I’ll get more upset at myself because I had been doing so well and now I’m not."

I thought to myself that somehow he must have known that I was thinking of harming myself and he was trying to make sure I didn’t. Because of him I was able to temporarily snap out of it."
