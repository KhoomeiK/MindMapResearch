FloridaCoronavirus,fqpwdfr,t3_g1u598,1589555188.0,"Hi, I need some help if possible. I applied for unemployment on April 15. A lot of regular things were waived, such as having to prove that I am looking for work, and such as having to request benefits every couple of weeks to prove that I am still unemployed.

As of May 10, they have ended waiving the requesting of benefits every two weeks. But when I login my application is still listed as ‚Äúpending‚Äù.

Is there a way I can request benefits every two weeks now that it is required? How do I do that? Since my original application is still pending, am I supposed to do a whole new claim in order to request benefits again? Or will that mess it up and should I just wait for my first application to get through?

Florida is fucking everything up and I am very angry and disappointed. I really need this money. Even if I got the regular amount of unemployment and not the $600 extra, I would feel some relief in my mind and in my wallet. As it is, I am just waiting, confused, almost to zero dollars in my bank account.

I have heard a couple Florida people said they got through by waiting on hold on the phone all, literally all day long. But I called yesterday and each number shortcut gets me the female robot voice saying thank you for calling, we are unable to do callbacks at this time due to high volume of calls. Then it hangs up on me, no hold music, nothing.

It‚Äôs very disappointing that the extra $1200, which I and I‚Äôm sure others really need right now, is gonna be impossible because the student loan forgiveness will not get through. I think she should have saved that one for later.

That being said, the $10,000 being taken off right now, if it happens, I‚Äôll be happy. It would in fact encourage me to use some of my unemployment money (if I have any extra and if it ever gets here) to pay towards the now-reduced student loan dollar amounts. And other debts.

I think a pause on all loans and bills would be great. It would help everyone, and not just students, like you‚Äôre saying. But as someone else pointed out here in this post as a comment, the government is only connected to federal loans, such as some student loans, and not mortgages etc. So they are unfortunately not willing to help with that arena. As it is, let‚Äôs face it - this isn‚Äôt going to get passed, anyway.

I wish they would just focus on the pandemic relief, and give us more than $1200 each."

CoronavirusRecession,fqiqagt,t1_fqil7ey,1589399430.0,"I agree with you that that‚Äôs what degrees are now; mere pieces of paper signifying we can work hard. But plenty of people without degrees can work just as hard if not more so. 

And yes, children and young adults need to be further exposed to various careers so they can be more equipped to pick them. Nonetheless, I still think 18 is too young to pick w college major, because most 18 year olds are still learning who they are and what they want. 

I think college elective classes should be more focused on real-world skills such as economics, car insurance, mechanics, communications, sociology and psychology, rather than simply college-level math, college-level English, college-level science, etc. the same shit we studied K-12. 

I think after 2 years of such useful and relevant electives, it‚Äôs reasonable to ask a 21 year old to choose a major. But after 2 years of just harder science and math etc., students are not equipped, and you often see people changing majors, regretting their chosen majors post-graduation, etc.

The value of a degree and education itself needs to increase and change. I think that school and a degree should significantly prepare young adults for the world ahead. As things are done now, it‚Äôs just not happening. This connects back to my previous point - things need to change, and, it‚Äôs not the students‚Äô faults that degrees are almost useless these days."

Pausing interest helps to save some money, but payments may still be due. Even if they aren‚Äôt due for some, they could still be paying it so that the length of their loan repayment isn‚Äôt stretched out even longer. You just don‚Äôt know. It‚Äôs an individual basis."
CoronavirusRecession,fqib9od,t1_fqi340z,1589393686.0,"Hey, I feel you, man. I meet people with jobs like yours every day at my job (well, the job I had before the pandemic). I have spoken to many and your words echo theirs: they are exhausted, they like the pay, but they‚Äôd like more time to spend with family and friends. I definitely have compassion for where you are coming from.

I am not asking for permanent forgiveness. Because you are right, you shouldn‚Äôt have to pay for my school, my parents and I chose it, and it was very expensive. It took multiple loans and grants to pay for it. All I am asking is temporary relief while this virus is happening. If $10,000 were taken off my student loans, I would use my money wisely to pay other obligations that I need to pay to survive while unemployed during this pandemic. I wouldn‚Äôt use it to buy a new car or a new piece of furniture, etc. 

The  point rises up amidst this discussion, that school is expensive AF and it should not be. I understand some hefty prices if you want to be a doctor, a lawyer, a psychologist, etc., but for most of the degrees, the price tag should not be so high. It is simply too much; the loans after graduation are burying us in debt. I‚Äôve already spoken in my last comment about how that affects us.

And for the people who say, pick a better degree - how the fuck is an 18 year old barely adult, truly just a kid in an adult body, supposed to know what they want in life and what job they want? Even if they pick something and like that, who‚Äôs to say they can get a job in the area they trained in once they graduate? What if they got a degree because they know a high school diploma means a job at McDonald‚Äôs and they don‚Äôt want that for themselves? 

Yes, some people are lazy and don‚Äôt apply themselves and as a result don‚Äôt get a good job. And some of these people are college graduates with degrees, for sure. But for others, it‚Äôs not their fault that their degree isn‚Äôt serving them; it‚Äôs the fault of the way things are running, and those who run it. Shit needs to change. This is why I appreciate so much this possibility of $10,000 student loan relief."

CoronavirusRecession,fqhst6j,t1_fqha2rq,1589383838.0,"Since you admitted that you don‚Äôt have any student loans and you didn‚Äôt qualify for much of the last stimulus check, I just don‚Äôt think you understand. I graduated 10 years ago and I have a bachelors degree but it has been a struggle to find a good job that is above minimum-wage.

Only recently, after years of part-time and minimum-wage and college student type jobs, have I managed to establish myself in the job arena as an actual adult. Even so, I am still on an income-based repayment plan for my $20,000 of student loan debt. Because I have to pay bills and rent and other items to survive, I put my money towards those and unfortunately little towards my student loan debt. So the interest builds and builds.

I know there are many in even worse situations, who have tens of thousands of dollars of more student debt than me, and who also have multiple cars to take care of, elderly family members or children to take care of and put into school, and feed, and dress, etc. 

Is it fair that myself and all these people are crushed by this student loan debt and increasing interest each year that we don‚Äôt pay it to 0, when we are just trying to live our lives, survive, and help our families?? You don‚Äôt understand how much this debt clouds and decreases our quality of life! 

I don‚Äôt think it is fair, and I know that for myself, $10,000 off my loans would be a huge relief. Even people with $50,000 in student loan debt would feel relief from -$10,000, I think. The student loan debt may have nothing to do with the pandemic and not be caused by it, but having it reduced would significantly aid myself and others in our ability to put our money (which, for many such as myself, is dwindling due to unemployment and state-delayed unemployment payouts) towards surviving and staying safe during this pandemic and recession.

Please do not knock student loan debt relief until you gain more understanding. I hope that my comment helps give you some perspective from the shoes that you are not wearing."
FloridaCoronavirus,fqhrkyd,t3_gixvr2,1589382989.0,"I think starting a daily meditation practice and learning about mindfulness would help you. That way, when you feel the anger rising within you, you can take a deep breath or say certain phrase in your mind or imagine a certain special place that makes you feel peace, and you can release the anger and emotion in the moment. That way you can just let whatever boss says flow down your back like a duck with water, where it doesn‚Äôt affect you.

Ever since Hitler, the Germans have been apologizing for what he did. When will it end? When can we love Germans again and understand that there are some people and their families there who have 0 Nazis in their family and would never condone such atrocities?

I took German language in highschool and visited Germany. Observing the German people and hearing about them from my teacher made me see how the Germans feel deep sadness and anger for what Hitler did. But why should random totally unrelated people have to suffer because this monster did such horrors? I‚Äôm sorry but I just don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair.

Even my German class was riddled with German apologies for the Holocaust. We did -field trips- to the Museum of Tolerance in Los Angeles, for God‚Äôs sake! We didn‚Äôt get to go somewhere that celebrates German culture or people; instead, for 4 years running, we went to the place where the worst German in history is shown speaking, and all the atrocities are shown in great detail.

Yes it was deeply affecting and horrifying to see what Hitler did and learn in detail, and yes we want to learn from history, but...when will the German class field trip be about their beer, their chocolate, their soccer or their tall and colorful houses? When will it be about how they bike everywhere and help the earth? When will it be about how they all know English so well and so kindly speak it to us visiting kids so we can feel a little comfort away from home for a month? 

Sometimes, Germany and Germans should be celebrated for who they are and what they do, instead of denigrated for what a monster and his group did."

Those were the days!"

CoronavirusRecession,fq63i2e,t3_gh05mm,1589123731.0,"Here‚Äôs my question. What is the best way to put up a sign on your business‚Äô  door that politely but firmly encourages people to wear masks? 

I want visitors at the career place I work at to wear masks, but neither do I want to offend them and discourage them from entering. A lot of our visitors are poor and may not be able to afford or wait for a $10-15 mask on Etsy, what do speak of Amazon.com prices, nor do they have sewing skills necessarily. 

I guess a shirt or bandana etc. will do in a pinch but...it just feels awkward. I want to stay safe but I do think some people are going to be pissed off.

My work building is small and with 8 visitors and 2 employees in it, because tons of people will be looking for work, it‚Äôs gonna be hard to be 6 feet apart, too...

*sigh*"
