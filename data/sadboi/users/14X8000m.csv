If it's not Salem, it's fudged forensics. So to just say we've got it 100% now is lunacy, so how can we go around executing innocent people? We can't.   


So I don't see how a rational person counteracts that argument. That said, if something is 100% proven, I've got video, DNA, signed confession, the judge and myself present at the crime and it's heinous, I could get behind an execution... theoretically. So I'm not against it in theory, but I can't condone executing innocent people so I'm against it."

Mountaineering,fp0ot7t,t1_foycgx5,1588213657.0,"Hi. So I've actually been to Dhaulagiri and Annapurna so I can give some context.   


Dhaulagiri's crux is pretty much right out of the gate, maybe 50-55 degrees and usually deep snow. There's fixed lines there but I've climbed it w/o, although there's one spot where it's almost vertical for 5m. The rest is a literal walk to above C2, nothing above 35 degrees. C2-3 gets steep but nothing special except for one rocky spot where it's probably 55 degrees besides that 40-45, mainly ice. Out of C3 is 50 degree firm snow to the traverse, then it's just the exit ramp and the summit.   


Annapurna on the Dutch rib can be pretty tricky w/ some 50 degree to vertical ice / rock sections so I'm saying this is a wash. The French route is more straight forward but no one uses that now a day. Everything has gone to the left of the rib and it's bringing in steep to vertical ice after the crosshair couloir. If I had to pick, it's Dhaulagiri first and Annapurna second in terms of difficulty but it's really close. I highly recommend both!   


Although Manaslu is the by far easiest and safest in the region, so I'd recommend that first. Incredible climb, too bad it's crowded now aday."
Mountaineering,foxtoum,t1_fox5ex9,1588155932.0,"Depends on the routes but yes the normal route on Dhaulagiri is a bit tougher than Annapurna. People think Annapurna is difficult because it's dangerous. Although both are pretty straight forward, just a lot of objective hazard."

For starters this would make doing the splits likely impossible and would affect how we walk. The other obvious issue is weight. If you're fat AF your horizontally split ass will also be. There's more fat and skin so more surface area to clap. If you're skinny, probably not enough skin to touch, if any, so no clap. Also speed is important.
