I tough until now she recieved it and it would have created some kind of judical presedence but it didnt. I guess for doctors its easier to argument for a rational wish to die if the person isnt (clinically speaking) insane. Where does the pain want you to die and where is the depression coming into it. I guess it is a lenghty evaluation where you could become another media case. When your own life is sudenly subject to court hearings then it could get akward aswell. I saw another documentary with terry pratchet (discworld books and films) where he joined an old couple where the husband wished to die because of age. It was very moving but its also a decission you cant take back. What if you could have gotten better. What if a mental patient hids their depression and sneaks through? It a mayor question of ethics more then capability. If you really hand it in to some form of medical board that has a say over how such cases are handled, give me a call. I am intrigued."

My friend never told me because his uncle is a leader of a monastery (aboth I guess) and his family lives in a conservative area. On his brothers wedding he just showed up with his boyfriend and no one really made a fuss about it. Even his uncle included his bf in the family that wished his brother everything good. I never asked my friend why he never told me but I dont care. Still a good chap and his bf is handsome, if I say so myselfe.

She still gets picked up more then I could ever dream off (or survive without IV transfusions of additional liquid). Other gay people will take good care of you. They all went down the same road and know how it is like. I guess they are more then happy to give you a hand.

If you get to know 100 humans you have a more then fair chance but technically it might be even less people you need to know since another factor is time.

I am not stupid (at least IQ wise apperently) so I musst eb lazy when I didnt write straight As all day. I was only validated by grades and yeah bad shit. Physical abuse happened and depression. I oulled through however. Graduated highschool (or my countries equivalent) and got accepted into university. It got better when moving away from my family but the pressure still was there and they paid for university and stuff. I studied for 5 years in which I was getting more and more depressed again, the irony\^\^. I quit with all my exams taken and my thesis written for my bachelors. I was 3 steps away but I couldnt bear it. Now I support myselfe and have a low paid job and no contact to my family again.

Yes, I am shure it might feel like shit if no one answers your question, I agree with you. However you are welcome to help this sub by answering those threads that dint get an answer yet. I try to start with something the OP did good (comming here to ask for help) and then go from there answering and contributing to every question that the OP has posed to the community.

While you sadly cant safe everyone its worth a try, tho. I had people never answering back after they said to be on the edge on I still wonder soemtimes. I had more people that were happy to have someone listen to their pain and just getting them over the lowest low. A person said that he would have killed himselfe if he hadnt found someone to talk him through the night. One person at a time I hope to make a change. I had people that helped me to not kill myselfe and I try to give back to the world. I did survive quite soem stuff and I know how it is like to wish to quit. Those who suffer arent aloneand for me thats what its like to be a human. Beeing a social person and caring for a indiviual in your species.

This sub has guidelines and rules aswel as some tipps to not ecourage suicide. They are psychologically sound. Shure a suicidal person can be tipped over easily but that goes for both ways. I am shure that a geniuine human interaction and showing interest and concern can tipp them over to chose life. We cant all be therapist or psychologists sadly, but this isnt about advertising yourselfe as a psychologist or healer. You try to form a connection and  help a person. Accepting that help is a often overlooked tiny step to get better tho. The wish to get better is a fundamental step to help building resilience (I could quote a science paper on that but its not in englisch but I can send you the link/abstractif you want). So if a person is accepting that help then theycan be pursuaded to get professional help. This sub might not be a solution but its a ressource for motivation, conversation and social interaction. Also depressive cognitions are mostly negative towards yourselfe (intrensic) and/or the world (extrensic) but mostly never against another person. Someone might wish to die, but you dont want that other dude to die. ""He is suffering right now, I know how it is to suffer so that makes two of us, right? I might write him and see if I can cheer him up. Its a good thing to do and maybe I will get something wholesome out of it aswell. [Win-Win.Win](https://Win-Win.Win). Drinks all around"" That might be a very common tought process\^\^

The only thing that sux on all of this is that you cant hug another person. A hug at the right time and a cry can change a lot, at least for me.

You did good writing your therapist, you dont need to deal with all this on your own. Honestly I dont know what to tell you. Religion helps statistically speaking when you have suffered a loss and if you find yourselfe having this situation intruding in your head and reliving it without wanting to, then I humbly recommend also talking to a trauma therapist. I want to tell you its all going to be good but I cant promise you anything, sadly. I can offer you however that you can always write to me when you feel like it. I  have seen some shit in my life, I know a bit and I wish to help you. Pls dont hesitate or think twice!

You may also get therapy for the kids. At least it would be important to talk with them about what they have seen and help them cope.

In the following weeks your family will be upset and I guess you might be too, but when humans are faced with violence (especially gun violence) and suicide then there is a hightened chance for commiting violence or suicide themselfe in the aftermath. I can only ask you to hold on and dont make any rash decissions yourselfe. If you can find it in you then also look after your brothers and family. I am happy your fiance supports and helps you, he is a good person to do so.

If you find yourselfe wondering about what you could have done or feel irrational guilt then talk to your therapist. Sorting irrational guilt out of the narrative of the story may be a vital part in your therapy. You survived and managed to protect  most of the family. I hope you can rather focus on that.

For the media, you deserve better then to be harassed by those vultures. Maybe you can find a family friend or even better a lawer to interact with the media and tell them to fuck off. I am rather pissed that you have to fight for your right to have privacy in this situation but thats how it is. I can only try to think of solutions for you.

It sounds like your inner sphere (emotions,feelings, your mind) is a warzone. Depressive people often get that classic 1000 miles stare because they are lost in thought but mostly its something well... depressing. You think about death and nihilism and how shit everything is in every free minute. Normally you should find peace in your mind from stuff from the outside but your mind is as dark as you feel the world is. You lost your shine so to say. That is okay, its still there, some asshole just dimmed your world view till you couldnt see it again. You need to get in touch with your emotions again but in a healthy way. How do you do that? Well tiny steps as always. If you are sad then cry a bit but not for hours. Crying is helping you decompress. You wont feel like a superhero crying in the shower or in your bed but understand that crying is okay. I needed to literally learn to cry again after I selfharmed for years. Sucked, like I am not gonna lie to you, but I overcame cutting by changing things and crying from time to time. Sadness is okay but try to shorten the time you spent on negative emotions. Take time for a rest without guilt, enjoy actively things that make you happy (ice cream, movies, social stuff).

Ever heard of biofeedback theory? You are afraid, your body reacts to it, your breath gets faster, your heart is pounding. You can alter this for a quick and simple effect while beeing paniced. Breath slowly (in through your nose out through your mouth), your hearth slows down, your mind reacts to it, your fear gets better because your body is no longer in fight or flight mode. Its the basics of all those breathing stuffs. Makes me feel like a zen master to be able to slow my heartrate\^\^. Meditaion is the same. Learn to be calm if you have to. Empty your mind of all the shit and just breath and be. If you get a state where you are okay with existing or dont percive your life as suffering in that moment you created a cold place in hell. GJ! As always get a therapist as a coworker to work on your mind. Suicide is a shitty option and dont let your fears or doubts tell you otherwise. Its one choice that takes all future choices from you. I dont like faceing stuff head on aswell, OP, but I tried doing nothing and let time fix it (agressive waiting\^\^) but it only got worse. It made me feel better to reduce my fears and take controll of stuff that makes me scared. You have to fight a monster every other day but not every day :) Thats a mayor improvement for me and maybe you can get betetr that way aswell."

Reflexive nihilism is bad. Try to find excuses to live and not to sweet talk suicide into your only salvation. Try to find excuses to make  stuff work and not devaluate all your goals when they become hard to reach. Dont just waste your recriational time. Like netflix and chips is cool but do something productive befor you relax so you can enjoy rest without guilt. One productive thing every day helps a lot. You arent useless if you can remember doing a good thing this day/yesterday. Same with laughter it sounds obvious but try to laugh for at least 10-20 mins every day. Not because you have to but because shit is funny. They tried treating depression patients with laughing gas and they felt less depressed if they could remember laughing the day befor. You dont have to laugh your ass of but a honest laugh is also a step. Take responsebility. Life doesnt get better but you can take charge to make it better. Its not going to be easy but its better then depression pushing you aroung like a little a conoe in an ocean storm. Befor you sleep try to actively recall 3 good things you did/happened this day. If you have depressions your brain doesnt code emotions on memory so well like in a healthy brain. Your amygdala codes negative emotions way better tehn good ones so that is a process you can restructure just with a simple exercise.

I can do some exercises with you because I read up on at least 2 others recently and would be glad for a practical feedback.

I once read something that stuck with me: Love, the cruelest form of attention but the sweetest form of torture. You came to know love but you lost it. Its okay and not your fault. Argueably there are a lot of people you could fall in love and that would love you back but it all depends on the time and situation. In my opinion love exists in timeframes. You can extend them or shorten them by your own actions but some things is framework (priorities change, emotions change, health changes). You had a beautiful year with a person you loved very much, thats nice! Be glad you had and it so its only logical it pains you to see it end. The thing is you will have this good time again, maybe not now and maybe not tomorrow but you will have it with another person. Shure, you might not want another person now, but there are a lot of people that can make you feel like that again. That you want to give all your love because they are awesome in a different and sweet way like your ex was. Its not an empty promisse, love happens if you like it or not. My first love was in a rough time and well I was young and stupid but she was too. It didnt work out and it was super akward but you will remember it fondly in a few years like I do too. I even still have contact with her and she is baseically A-sexual but hot as fuck and fucking crazy. If I could turn back time I would maybe give it another shot and it problably still would fail but thats is first love. If I hadnt moved on after her I wouldnt have known other people and how loving/beeing loved is with them. Its never the same cup of tea but we all enjoy the concept of tea, right? Its fundamental in our nature.

I struggled with depression befor my first love and after it didnt become sunshine and rainbows I was even more depressed and though its all over and I can kill myselfe because the best days are behind me, I missed the only chance someone would ever love such a twisted fuck as myselfe and blablabla. All my negative cognitions. I did a lot of copeing in bad ways but the good were to find your depression songs (I recommend Papa Roach ""The paramount session   [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjYEPbkW0y8&list=PLB42C3E26BEB13DC7](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjYEPbkW0y8&list=PLB42C3E26BEB13DC7) that was my jam :D) do some sports to feel good again and healthy and detox from all those memories. I still regularly delete everything after a breakup conversation ""the talk"" (eg. messages number, pictures everything). When all is said and done you deserve a break. Love is hard work and exhausting (shitty joke you can dodge here).>!(thats why its called blowjob and not blow holiday\^\^ badum ts\*) !<

The past is just a ghost jealous of every step you take. If you go on then it can only get different. Different isnt always better but different can be better. Death is an end to pain but also an end to every happiness you might find down the road. Pls dont kill yourselfe. The world needs more people that arent afraid to love<3"

I bet you are overworked and stress from all this shit. I can only recommend psychohygiene for you. There are certain ways to reflection and introspective that aid your salutogenesis and help to build your resilience. If you have depression then you need to make an active conscious effort to improve on you dysfunctional cognitions. Yes people die and you cant brush of the issues that come with it but you also heal and help! What field do you work in? I failed in becoming a psychologist so I respect the effort you did and still do to help people! Depression can weigh you down really bad and I m also working on gathering psych. essays on psychohygiene to make a comprehendable guide on how to improve just to fucking cope for the job I wont be doing for a life.

You might also read up on secondary trauma if you get confronted with death a lot right now. If you have insight in diseases you can better avoid the illness (at least in psychology).

You might have regretted the choice to call the suicide hotline but getting help isnt something wrong. Yes you are a doctor but that doesnt mean you have to be strong all the time and never get help.

Dysautonomia (not gona lie I had to google it since I only know a bit about neuropsychology but not neurology in that specific subject) is something I never heard of. I assume its secondary dysautonomia and not from birth or you wouldnt have been enlisted. 

I dont want to tell you that death is your only way out but it sounds like you have quite a huge sack of shit to deal with. You can learn more about all the illnesses and it will help your salutogenesis (at least for some) but ofc it has its limits.

A person in my close social circle has polyneuropathy and she is mostly confined to her bed aswell. She has chronic pain and can only walk with a walking aid if she really has to. Her doctor prescribed her weed to deal with her pain and it helped her a lot. I dont advocate self medication and since you also have eating dissorders and other stuff it might make things worse but for her it helped with the pain and it eases her mind. She had a smartys box of pills she had to take each day and now its maybe 5 pills. Its worth a try and if you dont smoke maybe try a edible.

The woman doesnt give a fuck because the cops killed her son some years ago in a over the top stupid accident and she was a bit of a loner since then. She likes the crazy guy that makes a fool out of the cops. In that context she could also just get evicted or something and the explosive dude is her chance to stay a bit longer. The police doesnt want all this to be a big fuzz so they keep it quiet. Then the old lady gets a heart attack and the bomber decides to quit his protest just to get her to the hospital.

SuicideWatch,fpltq55,t3_ge6r4r,1588719293.0,"Hey Anon, you are a good brother to care, despite your bro being an ass sometimes.

Its hsure does sound like Dave has some underlying issue that just come out when he is intoxicated. It also could be drug abuse (coke does make some people agressive or feel like they are better/everyone else is trash) or maybe he cant handle is liquor (friend of mine gets really agressive when he drinks whiskey).

I am not an expert but I know a thing about psychology or two, still its fishing in murky waters. Does his family have a history of mental illness, did he suffer any physical or medical harm in the last years. A big part of diagnosis of mental issues is ruling out physical illnesses first. You and I arent doctors so I plainly advise to get him hospitalised when he isnt himselfe and goes haywire the next time. My roommate has a brother with (not medical confirmed) drug induced psychosis we have to deal from time to time because we help careing for his son he doesnt give a shit about. He refuses to get treated and scares my mates mom/his own mom, who sufferes from a degenerative nerve illness, with violence and we cant do nothing without getting him hospitalised. We may throw him out of his moms house next week because my friend doesnt know what to do anymore and his mother cant walk nor defend herselfe. Getting Dave hospitalised might be for his own good, like it is for my mates brother.

If he posts weird shit on social media it doesnt have to be out of suicidal ideation BUT in combination with all the rest... where there is smoke there is fire. The simplest definition of a mental illness I learned is thoughts or behaviours that harm a person or others. Dave does tick both those boxes, sadly.

You cant do shit tho. He doesnt have a history of mental illness nor is he a fellon, I assume so you dont have legal leverage. My mate also thinks that his brother punching him in the face is the only way he gets forced treatment for longer then 24-48 hours. He went to get sober multiple times but just quit after a handfull of days and then back to anything he could get his hands on. Baker act its is\^\^"
SuicideWatch,fplqlrj,t3_ge6yra,1588717596.0,"Wanting the pain to end is just rational in my opinion. Suicidal phases or depression is something everyone goes through at least once in their life (statistics back that up aswell). The better argument is that there is other ways to overcome the pain and get better. Suicide doesnt give you anything back but fighting to live is equally shit but at least it has some potential rewards.

Depression is neurologically very similar to physical pain. If you have a knife stuck in your leg you cant think about anything else. No one would tell you its selfish to want this physical pain to stop,right? No one would tell you to think about tomorrow and it will get better soon. You have a knife in your leg and that is your focus. There is no tomorrow with all the pain you are feeling right now. Its limits your horizon.

There is no god. If it would be all good and all powerful like any religious book tells you then there would be no suffering. If we are rats in a maze then the creator of said maze is a cold psychophat without empathy. Life is more then just a test.

I am good to people because I want to be treated as well as I try to treat others. There is no rule of social behaviour I need religion to understand and respect. I dont steal because I dont want to be stolen from and I dont kill because I dont want to be killed (at least sometimes I dont). Life is a one time deal on a giant blue rock flying through space and you meet fellow monkeys whos genetical composition and circumstances of nurture are unique (at least in your lifetime).

Are you a veteran? I just read a medical essay about preventing secondary trauma in trauma therapists and psycho hygiene recently.

You can get money, met a girl, be better then your brother. Think of it as a sandbox game where you can experience the world.

You can be cured since wanting to die is part of the symptoms where depression is the cause. If the depression goes away then the pain goes away then maybe the wish to die goes away. I cant promise you anything but if you are suicidal every day it sux (been there for a long time too) and you can make it better. I tried and it suckes from time to time but much less then hating every second. You even get a reward which I never got from beeing depressed. I am very utilitarian and I was walking down the same roads mentally that I decided to just say ""fuck it"" and try soemthing else.

So I attempted couple of times. Hanging, OD and digging for veins. The build up to find the courage to kill yourselfe is full of tears, the occasional alcohol binge and smearing blood all over the place to find a way to see what the hell you are even cutting right now. To tell you I survived it is redundant but what most people dont know is that you regrett it when you think you passed the point of no return. I had plenty of reasons and the will to go through but then you find yourselfe like a fish on a line, shaking clawing trying to get off the rope because you feel yourselfe getting unconscious and rethinking death a little while the rope squeezes the eyes out of your skull. Then you manage to hold yourselfe with one hand while trying to get off the rope with the other and falling down like a dumbass, your body flushed with adrenaline and despair that you couldnt even finish that one job. What do you do then? Well cut down the rope from that tree since it doesnt really improve the landscape for others. Pack your shit and go home again, wear a scarf so your rope marks cant be seen and carry on. I never felt so empty after I tried and fail to kill myselfe. The moment you wake up shivering next to your vomit litered with pills, feeling oh so cold like a walking corpse but still alive. I am not even exagerating and there is plenty of shit I left out just because I dont want to relive that right now. This is like the icecream sundays version of trying to kill myselfe. Fuck me.

I still think about killing myselfe on a regular basis but the amount of determination, planing and act according to all that... I rather put that towards trying to get a better life. It sucks as much from time to time and and in the beginning its as painful BUT I get shit back in return and I love getting shit back for stuff that I do. Bonus fact is that I can even give back towards other that were good to me and helped me. If you are dead you maybe can hand out some organs or that little bit of money on your bank account but then nothing more. No economical help and no emotional support you can provide. In the contrary, funerals cost money and suicide just hands out confusion and anger/sadness to all people that loved you. I dont live on  for others but I dont want to shit in their cornflakes as a last good by either.

If you hang in there chances are you will just hang yourselfe because nothing fucking changes. Dont hang in there make it change! Passively waiting for a golden ray of light to blow coke up your ass and turn your life around wont cut it, my friend. You know what you hate and what keeps you up at night. Now what of all that stuff can you change? How can you make your life miserable instead  of hell? Then go from miserable onwards further up. You will cry and it will suck plenty dont worry, BUT its a way. No mather how much it sucks I never felt as shitty as around a suicide attempt again (both prelude and epilog). Suicide feels like the only control you have in the world at times but you can take this control back again. I rather fight against the world then against myselfe. You arent alone if you fight the world but I was mostly alone when I fought myselfe.

Your life your choice. That is what I am offering you. I made my choice and I pay for it every day but I get paid back. Do you really want to get nothing for your pain?

SuicideWatch,fpjjyfm,t3_gdtndh,1588671336.0,"Hey OP, you want to get better and that is what you can utilise.

From what I gathered from your post you are very strick with yourselfe and the misstakes you make. That is okay, but you need to keep it at a healthy level. Negative cognitions (aka patterns of thinking) can cause your brain (amygdala to be exact) to code more negative emotions onto memories then positive. Thats why shitty stuff sticks more around in your brain and your focus isnt on the good things anymore. Resilience or the art of copeing with problems is finding joy in helping yourselfe again. Its okay to complain and feel sad, well all do from time to time. Thats normal so dont beat yourselfe up because of it. There are allready enough things that brings you down, right?

Feeling useless and devaluation yourselfe is both contra producitve and common in people with dysthymia (short term depression below 6 months) and depression. Pls be aware that I am not an expert and this is not a label/diagnosis but I try to help you understand the trapps and troubles that your mind can put you through. If you know what you are up against its easier to defeat it!

To uphold negative cognitions is very exhausting and to change them might be as exhausting, BUT you get your life back. As always pls think about getting professional help, OP. Whole bunch of lads and ladies that joined in a branch of medicine to help people in trouble, just for your wellbeing. Its worth a shot. The longer you live in the darkness the more you forget what light is.

If you were self harming and thought about dieing and still are here, trust me you arent weak. Weak people refuse to take action and stagnation or refusal of decission is the true death. Again dont put yourselfe down. Situation might be suboptimal but you can only try to change your view towards beneficial cognitions. Its a long way from ""I hate everything and xyz is just making my life hell"" to ""I hate everything but how do I change xyz to make my live bearable or maybe even decent again"". You can do it but it will take an active mental effort for some time.

You are smart to ask for help! If you never talk about it you will just turn in circles in your hole till you go crazy. Smart people realise when they need a hand in life and then give others a hand from that better position. From "" I am a burden and leach on others to survive"" to ""I need help right now but once I am well again I will pay it back"". At least that makes it easier for me to accept help because its not a one way street if you think like that. None of us is that metaphorical soldier that walks alone through this depressed wasteland with the weight of the world solemly on their shoulders and I bet this guys (or just think about Atlas) isnt happy doing that either.

Many serial killers share some type of brain damage (blunt traumas, meningitis or something along those lines) damaging the prefrontal cortex (brainy stuff that is just behind your forhead) and is responsible for impulse control. There has been a very famous case (in neurological/psychological circles at least) of a man that got a iron pole through his prefrontal cortex (article  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phineas\_Gage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phineas_Gage) ) and his changes in behaviour.

I think it was trifold with neuropsychological issues ( learning dissability,dissruptive behaviour disorders) brain dmg and maybe childhood abuse but I am not shure. It has been a few years since I read that article.

Personally I think no one is born evil but its a combination of callous unemotional traits, psychologial issues and plainly getting away with smaller crimes and taking more risks. The first killings are not as planned out as later ones for example so if those multiple/serial killers get a chance to improve their modus operandi then they will be harder to catch.

He was stone cold (you can watch the interviews) and shoved people in sewer pipes so the rats would eat through them while they still were alive. He said this made is stomach feel a bit upset. So a person who can do this shouldnt be able to have any kind of emphaty for others, right? Wrong, he loved his family and literally killed for them on a regular basis. Never was violent with his kids or wife. 

He got eventually caught be a undercover cop who he deamed his friend. He said he killed all people close to him and if he could have gone back he knew who he should also have burried forever. In the fotage taken by the undercover cop he tried to get Richard to say he would kill someone on camera but his reply was ""Were there is a will there is a way"" and ""Accidents happen"". Chilling. His modus operandi was also quite ellaborate and he got taught by another hitman who was known as Mr. Frosty.

Dahmer did horrible things (cannibalism, cyclic hunting periods, tried to make brain dead sex slaves by pouring battery accid in holes he drilled in their brain, wanted to build a altar out of bones) but he had to get blackout drunk to dismember his victims because it (so he claimed) made him feel guilty. The same psychiatrist who interviewed Dahmer also happened to interview Kuklinsky so he drew comparisons between them. Dahmers case is just very well documented. You can watch the court hearing of the last victim that escaped him and thats is quite disturbing. The causality of his depravity was also researched in a lot of detail. He started by killing animals and dismembering them, fascinated by the mechanics of death. His father tho also had tendencies and urges when he was younger that he spoke about very openly and also claimed to have disected animals but never killed anyone. Dahmer and his father accused that Jeffries insanity could also have been cause by his mother taking certain pills (idk which one at the top of my head) while beeing pregnant that could have caused Jeffrey to get psychotic later on. His mother denounced it vehemntly, one could wonder if she was honest or protecting herselfe (there are also interviews of jeffrey and his dad in a talkshow).

Every psychological illness is caused by nature (genes and predespositions toward an illness) and nurture (they way a child is raised) but if you imagine a parent that has a mental illness raising a child that not only has their genes, but is exposed to an upbringing by a mentaly ill person then ofc they play into each other.

Psychophats or sociophats statistically occure in a very small ratio so every kind of information that can be put to use for profiling or wardening is in high demand.

Pls do note, that a mentally ill person is much more likely to become the victim of a crime then commit a crime themselfe."
SuicideWatch,fp5ggf3,t1_fp5e1fm,1588328478.0,"Now that you have chosen life the whole world can be your place to be aswell!

My advice is to take it slow and go one step at a time. If you try to turn around everything in a day then you might just get frustrated. Never forget to be good to yourselfe. Make space for things you enjoy and find pleasure in. If you are depressed your brain (amygdala) doesnt code as much information on memories that are good then on the bad ones. Thats why you are more likely to remember the bad things in your life/experiences. Fun fact: in a studie where you were told like 10-15 words to remember depressive people were significantly more likely to remember words with negative associations. So I recommend a small exercise in psycho hygiene: Befor you sleep try to recall 3 things you enjoyed in that day. If you find this to easy then go for 5. Just dont overdo it because that will result in an negative experience. Your brain is saving a lot of information especially the ones just befor (an hour - 30 mins) it shuts down for sleep so thats where you get the most benefits of doing that exercise.

Go get em champ!"
SuicideWatch,fp5fuab,t1_fp5a1wq,1588327822.0,"I think thats a very good advice. Also not a professional but I know a thing or two about psychology (studied it 5 years and quit with all my exams taken plus 13-14 years depressed).My Sister just hugged me and told me she loved me and I was welcome in her life. She didnt guilt me into not doing it again or wasnt angry just sad, but she didnt cry infront of me. She was strong just for me.

So from a psychological perspective punishment doesnt change behaviour in general but it only makes the person fear the punishment and leads to avoid the punishment but not change their ways. Fun fact, I was beaten regularly as a child and I can confirm this first hand (more like the back of a hand, but I digress). I would just start to lie and avoid getting beaten but it didnt make me more careful or study more or deal better with my fucked up mom. So thats that.

Go slowly is my advice, ease her back into life and maybe try to find out what she always liked to do in her life. You cant overcome her fears for her but you can show her that you are with her and will help her every step of the way. Openly talk about her getting help from a therapist. My dad told me that its the same like breaking an arm. You dont care why you are in pain you just go and get better. There is a lot of social stigmata with mental illnesses but its still an illness. No one who broke their arm is getting tought of as their arm beeing abnormaly weak and they should get their bone structure together again and not bitch around\^\^ In the same turn they dont get percived as strong for soldiering on with a broken arm, they just think you are stupid by doing so. Getting help is a first step to sanity.

Dont be overly worried (I know its not going to be easy) but if all her life now is about how she tried to kill herselfe eevry waking minute she will be heading to her grave again sooner then later. No passive agressive comments, dont necessarily bring it up with her friends since its her own choice to share and not easy to do so. Just make some time for normality. My sister and I often talked about how awesome ducks are and majestic while also beeing tasty and we did that in times where we both were run out and desperate but it made us feel normal and you know, happy duck toughts :) Hug her once a day if she is in the mood and if she doesnt want to tell her that you need it. Its good for people is the short explanation but the science one is that you induce oxytocine (bonding hormon) that makes people happy and is also central for social interactions and love.

If she cant bear her surroundings then get her into the car and bring her somewhere to a lake an ocean or into the greens. That made me happy because if you get sent back into the same room where you tried to die and went slowly bonkers then it feels like bad mojo to be there.

You are a good sibling :,-) Thank you doesnt quite explain how grateful I am that you care."

SuicideWatch,fp2zvy4,t3_gb02k1,1588270694.0,"First of all I really like the picturesque way that you explain your cognitions. I read a lot of posts on here and while I cant blame desperate people to not always be well spoken or literate its a nice change in the tone of narrative of suffering.

> I feel as though all life is precious. I have lived by my thought process that everybody is worth something and they deserve chances. Except for me. It is breaking me apart, when I hear how down people feel, how they want to end it all, I think- All life is precious. All life is worth something. All life is perfect.

I think the same, OP, but its a logical flaw to love all life and exclude your own. Rationally you are aware of that, I am shure, but that is a lesson you need to let sink in your heart. Your life is precious to me, even if I dont know you what so ever.

You struggled with pain and depression, possibly selfharm aswell and you dont deserve to live in pain. Death is always a sweet empty promise but it cant give you anything back, can it? Its just a pause from the pain, an end to suffering and the last thing you feel in control of. Its okay to get a pause and for suffering to end and I have defended that last bastion of control I had with tooth and nail but its the choice that ends all choices. The more you control aspects/situations in your life the more you can see that you are able to change things for the better. Its an active choice to strive to get better.

I know that on some rainy days you just go home and want to cry or do nothing till you rot away but these are also the times its most important to at least maintain your life. Its not going to be fun and its not going to be easy but at least you arent a plaything of the cruel winds of fate anymore. You have all the power to chose life and it requires the same determination and crazyness that it takes to chose death. I tried both and never managed to kill myselfe but currently I am doing okay with life. Its not all sunshine and rainbows but beeing okay with a situation is way better then feeling like a pice of coal in a furness.

I have trust issues, but there are people that never betrayed me and while I am sceptic about the whole thing I can just pay them back with everything I do and live on. In death I would be a true burden because suicide would only leave those people with guilt and sadness and thats a shitty way to repay my friends. The longest suicde note cant replace me and while its sometimes a bit of a shame over all I am happy I am more worth and usefull then a pice of paper\^\^

How about an utilitarian aproach? What benefits you most to feel or think that isnt all tangled up in emotional dissonance? You can fear problems, thats your right to feel that way, but at least you have to think that you could be able to overcome them. You might not be looking forward to it and no one is blaming you because of it, but how can you truely know the limits of your own potence if you never try your strenght? In latin potence means the abilty to be able to do something and thats strenght. For me only refusing to make choices in my own life means true death. Grab the wheel so at least you can be the captain of your own battered ship! Maybe its my masochism, but I got a long way navigating the storms of life while hopeing to get struck down by lightining each second.

Most wished can be solved with money in a quite rational pound for pound exhange rate so cheap labour rules.

First of all do you think the child is really yours?

If its your child then take the responsebilty because its the child that will suffer with a (clinical) crazy mom and no dad. Trust me a relative of mine is crazy and I am spending time with his kid while he is drinking or trying to deciper messages in the stars. He ruined his brain with drugs so dont pitty him. Kid is allright but troubled.

I could tell you two stories that might helo you understand. I met a girl some years ago in the train, lets call her ""trouble"" and she was fun and noticed my cutting scars so we had a chat. She offered to take me home to her parents so she could suck my duck and stuff. I dont mind good things starting off in a good way so I wasnt against it. I was a bit sceptic tho since it/she was to easy and that tipps me off very often. I kissed her when she went off the train just because why not. We had a bit of a thing going on and we were both rather young and she was hot and horny. Her mum was sceptic at first since she mostly brought home fucked up guys and while I am not a textbook stable person I try to treat people well and help where I can. Her dad died of heroine long agao and her mom beat his dealer down a stairways after he said that her husband had drug depts from his addiction. Cool move from her mom. It led to me caring about ""trouble"" and trying to fix her life. She ran away from home got marks from a knife fight in her face and she was also into drugs and shit. Classic bad girl but I am a helper like you and well pussy was good, not gonna lie. It ended with her mum relying on me to help her daughter and I gave troubles little brother (out of her moms second marriage) a lot of my old toys and stuffed animals I was fond of. Her mom adopted me as her son so to say and that was cool sinc emy family sux. I droped by often when trouble had run away from home and played with her little brother, helped her mom and we would grab a drink and a J at the end of the day and just talk. Her mum had a hard life but she is decent and never gave up on her daughter. I respected that. Tldr, I hooked up with trouble when she was back at home and her mom then warned me that her daughter had apperently slept with a junky and while we still used a rubber her mom recommended me getting an hiv test. Spent the next 6 months in fear if I was biological waste, dont get me wrong, I dont see HIV patients as trash but I was/problably am depressed and suicidal at times so it was just another excuse to choose to die. I learned from that and I hope you do too. Her mom also wanted me to be Ts boyfriend but lets say I saw the shadows rising over Mordor\^\^ T was suicidal and unstable so I let it run out slowly. I still cared but I didnt sleep with her anymore (jesus her titts! never seen such well shaped melons again after her for a long time). She couldnt be saved and what ultimately helped her was getting pregnant (not by me so dodged a bullet there) and she changed her ways. Straight 180 and she is a good mom now. Point is you cant help everyone and especially not people who dont want to be helped. A child or suicide isnt a bargening chip you can blackmail people with so while its hard dont let yourselfe get played like that.

Some people just need a warm shoulder to cry on and a breathing human with genitals and it doesnt matter how they get it or who it is. If they arent so picky then you can be. For their good and your own. If its your child then you can still chose a better relationship and try to make it work with this woman for the sake of your kid. My mom is unstable and a horrible person I wouldnt drop out of a airplane into a desert full of snakes because I pitty those snakes but my dad bit the bullet and married her (that idiot) because thats what you do. It didnt work out because he is also an asshole but both wanted the best in their own fucked up way. While it scared me for life it was a nice gesture. The only thing we all three could ever agree on is that they arent/werent and never will be suited to raise a child. I am still here and can tell this story and I have my own life now but thats my story. Its up to you what conclusion you draw from it but if its yours then you need to be in the childs life no mather how fucked up the mom is. If its not yourse, well every child needs somone to teach it things and show him affection and if no one really wants to do that in the first place then it will just have a shitty life and maybe you (more likely you make your gf) rethink beeing a parent.

Suicide isnt in the picture anymore,my dude. That ship has sailed because you would just leave the child behind with no dad and a crazy mother. Even my parents got another partner and I asked my stepdad to his face if he was a killer or wants to torture himselfe for past sins because no sane man would marry my mother and he said well she is fuckign crazy but she has good day. My dads gf is also retarded in that way but they are both happy, I guess. You can be too again and your gf can be aswell. Take your distance from the situation for your own sake. If the dice have fallen you can decide anew but dont play into her crazyness if you are vulnerable right now. You are better then that and deserve it. Dont martyr yourselfe over this person.

If god could give his ants comandments then he would be a smart boii and it wouldnt result in different world religions that constantly give birth to suffering and conflict.

You can also circumvent the ideas of intelligent creation and thus keeping a free will and improving on gods design with just your puny human mind: If you would impliment a taboo that is genetically ingrained in every person to not kill anyone of their own race then the world would be a better place. They still have a free will so they could harm someone or argue ofc but there wouldnt be premeditated murders or letting people starve in exchange for more profitable food sells. It would be less premeditated malice so to say. I like the idea. Its not much of an improvement,argueably, but smarter then gods plan. A lot of religious stuff can be dissproven if you think a bit about it. Psychology taught me there is a lot of streamlining when you tell a story and confirmation bias and religion only is benefical for you when you are griefing (they gave us statistics). I love to think about jesus kicking a dude in the balls because he didnt like white/black/ non jewish people but in 2k years it didnt really fit in the narrative of the messiah so it got streamlined into healing that person by touching him\^\^ From a social psychological perspective its really easy to understand. If you want to share guidelines on how you want otherpeople to behave then what book do you write? Be an asshole or be nice? And there you have the bible/koran/talmud and all the other books. Bronze age shit we still keep around."

Well done dude, the hardest part is working on yourselfe despite feeling like death is the only solution. I really hope you get well again and fully recover because any mental illness gets harder to overcome the longer you are stuck with it.

Get yourselfe a pat on the back and an icecream/beer, you have earned it!"
SuicideWatch,fow3y19,t1_fow1wl8,1588112564.0,"I am glad to hear that! Beeing heard and soemone caring about your pain is so simple but also so powerful. Talking doesnt change a situation but feeling understood and just a single person giving a shit about another can improve a life in so many ways.

I use reddit also to force me to adapt a different view on life because while I sometimes think that I wont be missed (I know I will tho\^\^) I think other peoples lifes and your life is important and worth so much. So I tried finding excuses to live and not excuses to die. Its like CBT but I do it at my own pace. I know a thing or two about psychology so its easier for me.

Some staff at a ward once said: ""There are more insane people outside wards then inside wards."" If you chose to get help you cant be batshit insane. I hated to accept help because it made me feel weak and trust isnt something I grew up with but now its okay. I still hate needing help but it now motivates me to get stronger and give back. I use my guilt to get better and my hate to overcome things. Also I punch the shit out of stuff with boxing gloves because I often feel angry because I am so weak at times\^\^ Its like becoming the Mc Gyver of your own mind. Use very emotion and method to benefit you.

Your mind is a muscle like everything else so train it! Actively remember good thing in your day befor you go to sleep. Dare to dream and be gratefull for little things. Only stagnation is true death."
SuicideWatch,fow1vau,t3_g9t825,1588111476.0,"Tried like 2 years ago I guess, lost my bachelors to my depression and hadnt a friend taken me in I would have been homeless. I still think about death or dying at least once week but I made some drastic changes in my life and faced the consequences and its okay now. I am not sunshine and rainbows and problably will have a dark and fucked up humor all my life, look like a razorblade testing field on some body parts but I am alive. The world is still fucking scary at times, but I have dreams and ambitions again. I found new situations and roles to play that I enjoy. I will never be a therapist but I can still help people and I am okay to find out what other things or jobs I can do well.

Recovery sounds so passive and while I have given up on therapy and drugs I baisically therapy myselfe by analyzing my cognitions and change them to something more benefical for me (nice that not all 5 years of studying psychology go to wast hmm?\^\^). Not more positive necessary, like I dont lie to myselfe that the world is just there for me and one day a golden ligth will shine down from heaven and make all things good. As a rational person you have to think that statistically as much good as bad things will happen to you in your life but I can do more good then bad things and thus make everything better for myselfe and people in my social circle. Getting sane is hard fucking work but where I tought befor that its not worth it and I should just kms, now I think that I will still die eventually and I should use this one-time-deal that life is and do things I like and test myselfe.

I try to take responsebilty for my life and now I dont feel like a plaything of the cruel fates so much. I can form the world to my will and reach out and help others. Its not much but its honest work\^\^"
SuicideWatch,fow000k,t3_g9vz7e,1588110521.0,"I am still glad you are alive stranger.

Sometimes you find yourselfe looking at a beautiful sundown or something you really enjoy on a good day and think, what a wonderful day it would be to die. I still have that longing like that holiday you never took or that trip to that one country you never got around to take. Its okay, missing something is often bitter sweet. For me its mostly tiny things nowadays where I sarcasticly think about how I should have done better on one of my attempts. I still find myselfe looking down from bridges over motorways or traintracks and waiting for a truck or train and getting run over in my head by it. Its only melancholy now for me and not fear, desperation and the insanity that trying to kill yourselfe can be.

Please notice that its not about stoping pain/the thoughts/your life but staying alive and dealing with all these things so you can be okay with it. For me I guess these thoughts wont ever stop completly but I hope I will be calm and stable enough that I wont ever find myselfe with a bottle in one hand and a razor in the other. These scars remind me that the past is real but its not a wall of shame of what I did wrong but lessons I learned the hard way. You maybe have those toughts but I hope you will find moments you enjoy in your life in the future or just never want to feel so empty again after you tried to kill yourselfe and didnt suceed.

Things will never get better on their own, BUT you are working for it and getting help and righting all those contra productive patterns of thought you aquired during years of stress and mental illness. Therapy can suck, I went home crying for months after each session but at least I faced my deomons and you do to! I am proud that you are still working on improving your life.

If you want to tell me what happend recently? I would be happy if I could help you help yourselfe<3"

Its more about getting structure in your daily life and then you can smoke on fridays or whatever. Nice meal does the same for me. Its going to suck moving out of your parents house but for me the benefits outweight the harship by a lot. You cook your own stuff have to clean your own flat but you can crawl home at 5am and no one cares. You can have friends and lovers at your place as often as you like. You will find out that your parents  are also sticklers for some stupid rules and you can make your own in your house (e.g. puff puff pass). My boss is cool and I rolled him a hand full of joints for christmas but I dont smoke at work anymore. What really gets me is driving with some rest thc and I know you arent ""high"" after 24 hours if you didnt blasted your brain with weed but if I would hurt someone by a simple driving misstake I would never forgive myselfe. Get a job and move out and then you can think about smoking again. Nothing wrong by putting it on the backburner. I would like to have a medical recipe so I dont have to deal with the black market fellows and you have a normal story were they have set times and you just walk in. Simple as that. I was hospitalised for depression and had an eployeeship in a withrawl clinic with additional psychological diagnoses and there wasnt a single on in there for smoking weed. Talked to people that drank themselfe into coma to not have to face their heroin withdrawl so that what drugs do to you. If you/genetic relatives have a vulnerabilty for scizophrenia or psychological issues then you should stay away from drugs generally. Everything you consume should be monitored constantly, be it foods drinks or any kind of medication or drugs. Dont take substances when you are down because then you cope with it. If you go to a lake or have a barbecue with friends then you can drink a beer or roll one up to relax. The evry day rituals are what mostly lead to bad habits."

When I got out of the psych ward and I returned back to my everyday life with them they turned the pressure right up again. Like depression and beeing suicidal is a fucking cold^^ After you learn a job or finish a degree no one will give  a single fuck about school grades so you do what you like. Dont kill yourselfe over a pice of paper. I nearly did till I realised that. I have to start all over again now, but at least I am alive and have another chance.

I dont have hope every day and some days I just continue because I am alive but I know my options and what I would like to do with my life. There is a way for you to but you need to find it with your own mind. You will stumble and maybe fall again but there are many people that wish you well and will help you get back up, brush of the dust and send you once more into the fray.
