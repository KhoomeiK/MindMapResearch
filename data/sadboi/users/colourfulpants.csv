As for iron, legumes again, fortified foods, dark green veg, and some grains like quinoa. I personally advocate for cooking in cast iron wherever possible. Some people may still need to take a supplement, thats okay too, just check in with your doctor, as some supplements may be too much.

**IF YOU ARE NOT USED TO EATING WHOLE FOODS LIKE THIS AND YOU JUST JUMP STRAIGHT IN** the amount of fibre might be a shock to your system. Transitioning more slowly can help with this. Also just a general PSA to listen to your body and talk to your doctor, as I am not one; nor a dietician.

-buy in bulk. I buy my rice, lentils, and flour by the 10kilogram bag. Anything dried and sealed properly should stay fresh for ages.

-check whats seasonal for fresh fruit and veg. Bananas and carrots are almost always cheap, so theyre a good winter staple. You can freeze seasonal fruits and veg too, I stock up on frozen pumpkin and coconut this way

-frozen berries and greens are your friend. So much cheaper than fresh and they work the same.

-nuts and seeds are important. In particular: flax/chia for omega-3s. Peanuts and sunflower seeds are some of the cheapest, and I like em so theyre a staple for me.

-INVEST IN A GOOD SPICE CABINATE 100% the easiest way to enjoy cheap staples is by adding cumin lol

-if you're busy, get used to meal prepping. I either bake muffins or make overnight oats for breakfasts over a week.

-Decide what ""expensive"" foods are worth it to you. I tried powdered soy milk because it was 1/5 the price of silk but it was so grainy I went back. 

-You should be aiming for twice the RDA of zinc from plant foods as from meat, this should be no problem if you eat legumes and grains. 

-You should be aiming for 1.5 times the RDA of iron from plant foods as meat. I would suggest cooking in cast iron and checking in with your doctor if you suspect you are anemic. 

-B12. Take it. Most supplements are big enough to be taken once weekly, sometimes even less if you consume fortified foods.

An example day for me would look like:

Breakfast: Overnight oats (1 cup unsweetened soy milk, 1 cup oats, 1 tbsp ground flax, 1/2 cup of frozen berries, and some cocoa powder or cinnamon) 

Lunch: Tofu scramble cooked in cast iron with spinach, mushroom, and onion on grain bread

Dinner: red lentil daal over rice 

Snacks: A banana, a carrot (you can cut it into strips and serve with hummus but full disclosure I just eat it straight up lmao), 1/2 cup of trail mix, about 3 parts peanut to 1 part sunflower seeds with a little bit of dried fruit or dark chocolate chips)

Other: about a gallon of water throughout the day, choline supplement daily, vitamin D supplement daily if its winter. B12 once every couple of weeks. I cook with iodized table salt. 

If I need more calories (which I usually do) I'm a big baker so I usually have cookies or something on hand. If not, I've been known to eat peanut butter out of the jar with a spoon lol.

This has me hitting every single nutrient RDA, ~2100kcal, 100g protein, 300g carbs, 60g fat. 

My macro minimum breakdown is based on  6g carbs, 1.7g protein, and 1 g fat per kilogram of body weight. For ease of math I round my 57kg to 60 lol. I would not advise going below 1g of protein or fat per kg. 

If I average out all of my grocery bills, I keep below $15/week.

vegancirclejerk,fpbj2o1,t1_fpbhknr,1588471167.0,"The thing is veganism is also more ethical for humans, not just animals. 99% of meat is factory farmed, so lets not pretend omnis are by and large hunting fish themselves to survive. Then, we can look at how slaughterhouse workers have one of the highest rates of workforce PTSD, and how animal agriculture requires more crops to feed the animals than direct to consumer plant agriculture, and how that increased demand for crops makes it so that more humans are forced into slave labour to meet market demands. We can also look at the destruction of our environment for animal agriculture (See: the fires in the Amazon and animal ag being one of the highest producers of greenhouse gasses). 

Quick google search tells me travelling accounts for 8% of the global carbon footprint (2.5% is flying) and animal agriculture accounts for 13-18%. Dont forget, food needs to be transported to the animals who then need to be transported to the consumer. 

All that aside, yes. Environmentalists who fly and drive unnecessarily are being hypocrites. Just like the majority of leftist omnivores."

People are very dogmatic about hclf/hflc diets; but most reports comparing these diets compare them relative to the SAD, which is obviously not a great baseline for those who already follow a healthier diet. 

In general, I have seen the most evidence pointing to a moderate carbohydrate diet (50-55%).

Fitness,fp41sd8,t3_garwyb,1588290004.0,"Hey! I used to coach a learn to row program and row varsity for my university!

500m in 2:00 is actually decently fast, I feel like I should point out that rowing times vary greatly by gender. The mens 500m world record is  1:10.5; the womans is 1:24.5. That being said, these numbers are based around Concept2 machines, any other ergometer is likely not as accurate for pacing. I wouldn't stress too much about it. 

Resistance 4 is pretty standard, most rowers won't go above a 5.

I would consider posting a video to r/rowing on Technique Tuesday if you're comfortable. Rowing technique is harder to grasp than you would expect, there are quite a few videos online demonstrating as well.

Concept 2 has a bunch of workouts including this list of [workouts for beginners](https://www.concept2.com/indoor-rowers/training/tips-and-general-info/first-workouts).

AskVegans,fp3zsje,t1_fp3oq93,1588288903.0,"I disagree. 

It is literally impossible to exist without causing harm to animals. The houses we live in are on destroyed animal habitats, vegan food harvesting results in animal deaths (though exponentially less than omnivorous diets), hell even walking outside you're bound to step on an ant at some point. The only way to avoid placing your human life above animals is to die. 

If I have to choose between saving a human and saving a mouse I will choose the human. Optimally I would save both; but to claim that I value both lives the same would be a lie."

That being said, I believe if you truly loved animals you would not pay for them to be needlessly tortured, raped, and slaughtered.
