Q: How do you make a blonde laugh on a Saturday?

A: Tell her a joke on Wednesday!

We were living in an apartment that had just gotten broken into and everything was stolen, come to find out the management knew about a string of break ins and was doing absolutely nothing so we decided to look for a new apartment. It was the dead of Summer and the apartment complex had a sale on that your first months rent was the highest degree it hit that week.

My husband looked at the realtor and said something along the lines of ""oh man we should come back in the winter"" and I just shot daggers out of my eyes at him. I immediately went into emotional overdrive because i didnt want to stay where we were and how could he think about waiting until winter, yadda yadda yadda.

Come saturday we were driving to the grocery store and I started hysterically laughing because it finally clicked, he wanted cheap as shit rent. Seven years later he still brings it up üôÉ"

I don't hate my husband, but sometimes I find it hard to feel love towards him as well.

My SO and I have had a rough few years due to decisions he made about our life for us once we found out we were pregnant. There have been low lows, times we've talked about separating, but every once in awhile theres just a period of love and hope before it gets depressing again. 

If our lives were to change, knowing the amount of work we have put into it through therapy and late night talks, and all the tears l think we could have a strong happy relationship. It's just about living through that dark abyss of whether or not that change will happen and if we can both wait for it."

AskReddit,f22ihnd,t3_db4jdq,1569889735.0,"You want a physicist to speak at your funeral. You want the physicist to talk to your grieving family about the conservation of energy, so they will understand that your energy has not died. You want the physicist to remind your sobbing mother about the first law of thermodynamics; that no energy gets created in the universe, and none is destroyed. You want your mother to know that all your energy, every vibration, every Btu of heat, every wave of every particle that was her beloved child remains with her in this world. You want the physicist to tell your weeping father that amid energies of the cosmos, you gave as good as you got.

And at one point you'd hope that the physicist would step down from the pulpit and walk to your brokenhearted spouse there in the pew and tell him that all the photons that ever bounced off your face, all the particles whose paths were interrupted by your smile, by the touch of your hair, hundreds of trillions of particles, have raced off like children, their ways forever changed by you. And as your widow rocks in the arms of a loving family, may the physicist let her know that all the photons that bounced from you were gathered in the particle detectors that are her eyes, that those photons created within her constellations of electromagnetically charged neurons whose energy will go on forever.

And the physicist will remind the congregation of how much of all our energy is given off as heat. There may be a few fanning themselves with their programs as he says it. And he will tell them that the warmth that flowed through you in life is still here, still part of all that we are, even as we who mourn continue the heat of our own lives.

And you'll want the physicist to explain to those who loved you that they need not have faith; indeed, they should not have faith. Let them know that they can measure, that scientists have measured precisely the conservation of energy and found it accurate, verifiable and consistent across space and time. You can hope your family will examine the evidence and satisfy themselves that the science is sound and that they'll be comforted to know your energy's still around. According to the law of the conservation of energy, not a bit of you is gone; you're just less orderly. Amen.

Parenting,euw09dd,t3_chl1gl,1564067955.0,"As someone who also suffers from migraines and primarily takes care of her child alone you did nothing wrong. Yesterday we had a lazy day because I had the worst migraine I've had in about a year. I laid on the couch under a blanket with ice packs and pleading for quiet, avoiding taking my migraine meds that would knock me out but still not being an incredibly present parent. We have been doing this since my daughter was a baby and now she is four. There are no detrimental consequences to her life, rather I think she has learned empathy and understanding illness through it as she was changing my ice pack for me all day while kissing me on my head. Also, as she gets older she knows that in these times I need to do this to be well but she also knows if anything comes up I am there.

There is no right way to parent because every parent and child has different circumstances. Sometimes this is just how your life might look and your neighbor needs to have more patience."

Anxiety,eor4062,t3_bstvzn,1558800778.0,"A few summers ago I had a problem with this. I used to be very fun and outgoing, never really standing still, nothing was a problem. I didnt even know I had anxiety and depression because I was at a point in my life where I could never admit anything was wrong. 

Then I started developing phobias I couldnt do crowds, I couldnt do anything that I felt like a sitting duck, I developed an extreme weather phobia where if there was any chance of a storm I'm inside the house. I ended up switching my classes to all online and never left my house. 

In the midst of all this I wouldnt say I had a great support system because if there was any mention of what was going on it was in a very negative connotation. This lasted for a good year. 

But then, I had my daughter. And I got. Postpartum depression, borderline psychosis. I started working with a therapist, taking medication. Slowly identifying some of these overwhelming problems in my life I couldn't face made the day to day stuff easier. Theres clouds in the sky and I just went on a bike ride. Last night I left my house after the sun went down. Every victory is a step forward no matter how big or small 

MORAL OF THE STORY is that sometimes this is part of the journey. A terrifying almost soul crushing part but you need to acknowledge it. Maybe try scheduling counseling on that one day a week you do make it out. Ensure that your mother knows the mental state you're currently in and why its important to have support. If you're on medication check in with your doctor to make sure they're right, if you're not maybe try to get on some. There's light on the other side."
