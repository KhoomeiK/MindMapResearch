Have you never met an American with a modicum of wealth and power over someone? The culture incentivizes a lack of self awareness to justify the accumulation of wealth as merit rather than a series of unrelated factors. Born rich, exploited labor, and predatory behavior are encouraged so individuals can be placed on a pedestal for hero worship.

 Republicans are the party of these people, they live with themselves quite easily.  If they start to question their circumstances then they would start to question the validity of merit in their success and that would be a challenge to their power.

Either that or they're dumb."
recruitinghell,fql7hi6,t1_fqku4ci,1589448957.0,"I'm a man, it's in the name.

I understand what you're trying to convey and it is appreciated, unfortunately it does absolutely nothing.  I really hope you read that line and the following in a emotionless monotone rather than an aggressive voice.

 I have been victimized by circumstance and anomalous statistics which I can find no entity at fault, other than modern American society. I only say that since the only consist variable has been the environment I have been born into, lived, and put full effort into escaping. I have fallen through the net and cracks of society, I continue to fall as I type this absurd amount of text.

I actually don't have any regrets from the results of my actions, other than being conscience throughout three and a half decades. Common downfalls of obsession (such as substance abuse or material acquisition) my body quickly builds up a tolerance to and I can take no pleasure from such consumption (including food).  The risks I have taken all resulted in failure and the responsible actions never lead to safety or security.

I've spent years on self improvement, after the idea of assigning blame to any outside parties proved to be an illusion. I could only assume my problems were of my own doing thus tried to correct them for years. After garnering none of the results that give metrics of a human existence of worth, this lead to what I can only surmise to be ego collapse. Only things left were my personality and beliefs, I had nothing else I could left that I could attribute to my alienation. I was incorrect, my imposed nihilism disgusts people around me. I filled that newly created mental void with marketable work skills (web and app development), I don't remember much of my youth now due to that.

Unless you have work leads in my profession or insight on how to immigrate to either Canada or Europe, your words won't do anything for emotional well being. I need actual tangible help. If you have that DM me, but I have no desire to waste any more words besides this ridiculously long response. I was barely eking out an existence before all of this and now circumstances have now gotten to a difficulty level I can't formulate a strategy against; that I haven't tried and failed multiple times before. 

My neighbors are Covid deniers and my roommate isn't self isolating, I don't have the resources to stay safe.  The sun will rise again, but so much time has passed that I can only imagine it will only serve to bleach my bones."

My unemployment is frozen, because the unemployment site couldn't handle the load and it didn't register my renewal request. To unfreeze it requires communication with the unemployment hotline which is either a prerecorded message stating nobody is available or a busy signal. The irony is I could probably build a better system myself than the state government.
