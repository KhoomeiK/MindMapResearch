LGBTeens,fnwznhn,t1_fnwz6hq,1587328603.0,I appreciate the reply. We did have a little conversation and she said we'll work things out as soon as this Coronavirus mess blows a little over. But thank you
relationships,fmvsmlc,t1_fmvqx8v,1586429350.0,"I got hurt before by a ghost and honestly, I'm not letting that happen again."
relationships,fmvslfm,t1_fmvrb73,1586429315.0,"That is possible too, I probably should have mentioned in the original post that he also has mental health problems. We have talked about this before as we've known each other for about a year but only really intensely started talking these past weeks. He does suffer from PTSD as well. But I don't know what is going on. I reread the chats, before I told him about the anxiety situation, he already seemed off and cool towards me."
relationships,fmvqtgc,t1_fmvqf8x,1586427345.0,Yeah because if he ghosts me now then most likely it would happen again when we're together
relationships,fmvqr55,t1_fmvq97f,1586427273.0,"This is another perspective to look at, yes. That isn't impossible, I mean that he made it about himself. Yeah, This is becoming more clear by the minute. Thanks, this is really a big help."
relationships,fmvqnze,t1_fmvqi47,1586427174.0,My anxiety was through the roof because my PTSD was causing me to have flashbacks over stuff that happened a few years back. I wanted to talk to him about this too but then he started acting like that so i left it.
relationships,fmvq80g,t1_fmvq4o5,1586426674.0,You also think I'm wasting my time by trying to wait for him to get his marbles together?
mentalhealth,fmvpviq,t1_fmlsa9w,1586426276.0,"I managed to talk to one of my close friends too, i havent talked to him yet, as he ghosted me all of a sudden after i told him my anxiety is killing me. But i get what you mean. Thank you! :)"
mentalhealth,fmlkvtq,t1_fml9zz2,1586188401.0,It's hard to find the right words to describe it. I was thinking i should start writing stuff down. Thank you so much though..
mentalhealth,fmlkoxw,t1_fml3nqc,1586188297.0,"Yeah, those words are pretty much burnt into my mind. Lately, it's hard to find a therapist who won't judge or blame the victim."
mentalhealth,fml26gr,t1_fmkw5j6,1586176613.0,"It's a long and hard battle. I was at this therapist once and she insinuated that It's my fault I feel like this and it's not a big deal. Meanwhile, it's scarred me for life and I am afraid of men. Everywhere in public, I keep my hunter's knife with me, just incase. But yeah, I'll pick up pretty fast through his attitude if he is genuinely into me or if he just wants a quick hookup. It's hard enough to open up to him about my other issues, as people have left me before because of that."
mentalhealth,fmkvgbs,t1_fmkuus6,1586170195.0,"Woah, that actually seems like a really good way to let things go. I think i might even give it a try. I probably should tell him, but i'm scared of the outcome. It's so much pressure to even reply to messages, as that fear of what the message is, is always there."
LesbianActually,fht87ko,t1_fht3sgj,1581871528.0,"Well, i agree with you. What did happen afterwards, is i found out she used that as an execuse to leave me for another girl. She cheated twice on me and i was still willing to forgive her. She basically hates me now too, because i confronted her about it after she told me."
LesbianGamers,fhrkqha,t3_f4bfgt,1581829031.0,YessðŸ’ª

depression,ff6ewft,t3_erqjbv,1579625696.0,All the time.
LesbianActually,fdm3z37,t1_fdl6bd1,1578539241.0,"Okay yeah that is true, i did tell her that if i'm not giving her enough space or doing something wrong she should tell me and like tbh she is mostly the one making conversation with me she still calls me baby sometimes last night she did again and told me to call her because something bad happened so i just tried to calm her down and that was it. But i'll see how stuff goes maybe i will maybe i won't idk but thanks"
LesbianActually,fdkk0eo,t1_fdkjirc,1578505247.0,"Thank you! That actually means a lot, thank you"
LesbianActually,fdkegx5,t1_fdkd9vz,1578502144.0,"I didn't mind her blocking me, it was just once, she does battle with a lot of mental health problems but i'm patient with her. Idk why she blocked me though, might be because of the breakup."
LesbianActually,fdkap5r,t1_fdkablv,1578499872.0,"(Forgot to mention she was the one who left me) She blocked me cuz we broke up, there was so much drama involved in that breakup and i accepted it as ""okay well i guess we're done"" so i tried to process everything and the no contact helped with it until i got drunk on new years and messaged her on instagram and she said she will unblock me which she did and she did tell me she wasn't taking the breakup too well and i said neither am i and it got left there and a few days later she tells me she loves me and lets just be on a break till we figure stuff out and i said okay well take all the time you need, but yeah i kinda agree it is wrong"
LesbianActually,fdka6px,t1_fdk9877,1578499549.0,"Okay then i shall do that, thanks"
StopSelfHarm,fdj7pbr,t1_fdj3123,1578460802.0,Thank you! I hope it would help too. We'll have to wait and see for that one
StopSelfHarm,fdiywpj,t1_fdiy581,1578454238.0,"Agreed. It ain't easy. I'm starting by going to see a psycologist a little later this month, i made a decision that was hard for me to admit. I admitted that i nees help. I can't do it on my own anymore, i have too much things to deal with and it gets too much. So i'm starting with that, getting the medication and probably therapy too. It's going to be a big meal to eat, that elephant ain't small at all."
Cricket,fdixfav,t1_fdi3wjd,1578453233.0,"Well, to be honest with you, no they can't. Why? Well, i'm a south african and the last year or i have seen our performance in cricket decline dangerously. I have no idea why, but especially in the batting. One guy faced something like 106 balls olny scoring 16 runs. The bowlers and fielders gave england a lot of chances to score many runs. If you perhaps said that statement a few years ago when the big guys like AB De Villiers and Hashim Amla had a partnership, sure they would have saved us in no time. This is my personal opinion though, but i'm sure a few other people would agree with me."
StopSelfHarm,fdiwpb7,t1_fdiivoq,1578452757.0,"Wow...this was incredibly inspirational to read. Thank you for sharing this. If i ever need to vent, which is regularly tbh, i will PM you. I also want to try the ""if i can see it, i can run to it"". If i can see the light in the end of the dark tunnel, i can make it to that."
StopSelfHarm,fdgf6in,t3_el5x5i,1578393967.0,I'm proud of you. It takes a lot of strength.
southafrica,fdgej2b,t3_el52q3,1578393049.0,"I was sitting in traffic at a 4 way stop once and the lane next to me is a left that only turns right, i was in front of the line waiting for the light to go green in the lane where you can only go straight and the light turns green, one of those buses was next to me in the right lane, i had a suspucion that he was going to jam himself in front of me so i stayed way under the speed limit and i was right, next thing i see he turns right in front of me forcing me to brake hard, nearly getting rear ended by the car behind me. I wish i had it on tape tho. I got the number plate and reported it to the metro police and absolutely nothing came of it. This is why our road death stats is the way it is."
SuicideWatch,fd1xyp2,t1_fd1xozx,1578138568.0,"I'm sorry nobody was there for you...but yeah i agree, it's a really hard thing to deal with alone. But thank you for helping me out here. I really appreciate it."
SuicideWatch,fd1ueo4,t1_fd1f6ev,1578136972.0,"It is, she told me she can't handle her emotions and she can't even go to the places we used to go because it hurts too much. I let her know that I'll always care and i'm here if she needs someone. I did ask her if we can at least be friends and she agreed to that. The reason she wanted a break is because she was and still is dealing with a really bad time in her life and she can't tend to that and a relationship at the same time and because she doesn't want to end up hurting me because she is at a bad time in life. Which is very considerate of her, she also said she is doing it to protect the both of us. She left me and blocked me, on new years i sent her a message on instagram wishing her a happy new year and she unblocked me. We started talking again and we established a friendship. The other day she came clean about her feelings and said she still loves me but she really needs space. We are something yet not official but i told her she must take her time and i'll give her all the space she needs and i'm more than willing to wait."
SuicideWatch,fd1thap,t1_fd1jtwe,1578136559.0,"We are kind of back together but not officially. We're just seeing how things are going at the moment then taking it from there. She was the one who came forward about her true feelings yesterday, saying she loves me and she wants to be with me but she just needs space. I completely understood, i'm trying to be there all i can. Thank you for the help, i appreciate it"
StopSelfHarm,fd0uyec,t3_ejqx1c,1578124106.0,Very proud of you!!!!
SuicideWatch,fd0ujhn,t1_fd00ryt,1578123945.0,"Thank you, I will give that a try. I hope it works, because about a week ago she almost took her life over the phone with me and i had to do everything i can to save her life and keep her from doing it. She eventually calmed down and said she won't do it."
SuicideWatch,fd0tw29,t1_fd0kw3l,1578123696.0,"It's not attention seeking and i know that for a fact. She lives with serious mental illneses and i'm basically the last person she has left in life that actually cares. We weren't in a shitty relationship, she needed space and i needed it too. And yes, it is hard to make that decision. Been there, done that, tried jumping off a building but some idiot pulled me back before i went down further."
depression,fcpph9c,t3_eicjbl,1577869319.0,"Same, i drank myself to near death last night, it was new years yes but still. I'm in a dark place and i finished a bottle of wine by myself."
