And it upsets me when Michelle, for example, comments on a queen's body shape not being feminine enough (""it reads as boy"") because some women's bodies are not actually all that feminine-looking. It's hard enough being a woman, and that's not to say that LGBTQI+ don't have it worse, but being dragged down for these things is just an extra layer of crap that is unecessary."

AMA,fo90ybt,t3_g6dukk,1587608082.0,I think you'd actively have to hate women to be an incel. Here's my question: Do you want to be an incel? I doubt it. Women don't care about weight as much as you think. We care about personality. Might take you a while but really all you need is to be a good person and have a some character.
AMA,fo90tuv,t3_g68x8a,1587608004.0,"Why do *you* think cops are so hated, and do you think that's partly justified? I ask because I don't like cops. I live in Canada, and in my city, there are too many cops and they fine people for small things. Lots of racial profiling, lots of useless monitoring of people as though we are dangerous, when it's a very safe city in reality. It feels like they are always just trying to kill our fun. Not to mention, lots of poor judgment calls (like some cops ticketed some homeless youth who were together, not practicing social distancing, when they obviously don't have the money to pay and are always together anyway/are kicked out of shelters at 8am)."

I think it would have fit well on Morning Glory (and put She's Electric on Definitely Maybe!)"

NextInFashion,fnxwc9g,t1_fnx15z8,1587347746.0,"I'm a big fan and I've listened to and read a ton of stuff over the years, on reddit and also interviews with the queens, so I can't remember where exactly, but i do also remember in the season 9 reunion episode (if I'm not mistaken) they alluded to sleeping 1-2 hours a night. One queen said she only got a couple hours asleep and that's why she had done poorly and the others chimed in to say that was no excuse because they also got little sleep. I know that their days are like 15 hours long sometimes, they do a challenge then get into drag and makeup and the runway and critiques last a few hours apparently."

Not to mention, Heidi, who is my favourite of the season, I don't think she deserved that win! She wasn't the funniest. My fave was Jackie, but both Crystal and Jaida would have made sense. Heidi's make-up was rough, and also she was funny but not hilarious in her infomercial. And Gigi.... easily could have lip synced against Widow. Girl WHAT, WAS THIS EPISODE!!!!!!"

2 - No synthetic materials, unless it's winter boots or winter coats (I'm from Canada). Chose this because I am concerned about microplastics, and now I need to find %100 cotton underwear and I can't seem to... The elastic has plastic, obviously.   
3 - Never, ever buy shoes if they are even a half size too small, no matter how adorable.   
4 - Except for socks, shoes, and underwear, only buy second-hand or on sale. Only pay full price if they are local designers.

You have time on your side to figure out how you can make that happen. Is it spirituality? Is it a change in perspective? You do you. You WILL get better, You have to start with one minor step, and it will open a door. The next step you take will open two doors. Be patient with the process.
