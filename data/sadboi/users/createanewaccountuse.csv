Always have more than one spot to park. 

It can take some adjustments to go to a different spot every/couple of days. 

Scout your locations at various times of the day.

Pay attention to little things, like do people have bars on their windows, can you see home cameras (I had mixed feelings about this one since if people review their footage they would noticed you never get out, but if anything were to happen to you, people have footage).

Maybe stay up a night or two to people-watch/get a lay of people's habits. Like, in poorer neighborhoods I noticed people got up/left earlier. So I knew when I had to be gone if  needed.

I liked to park as either the first or last car on a block or driveway. That way you have only one vehicle to worry about. Same withparking next to bushes, only one side door to worry about. 

Practice getting to/from the front/back seat of your car to the other. This can be done any time really, like at a park, but good to be able to do quickly if you ever feel you need to cheese it quick-style.

I grew up poor, food insecure daily kind of poor. Went to school in hopes it'd help me change my situation.

I graduated at a bad time (economic downturn), inured medical debt (hit by drunk driver), left homeless.

I took a shitty job to pay off my medical debt as fast as I could first. Even with a shitty job and homeless, I still found a way to pay  my loans. But once I did, damm did my life change for the better much faster (cut back my working hours to work on my social skills, got way better paying job, was able to save, get housed, exit).

So I'm conflicted by this.  Some people I've spoken with about this, mostly young kids at my work say, tough luck, but then get mad when i say tough luck if they don't get loans forgiven. I understand not having the extra payments could help their situation but at the same time I don't think it's be fair to those that found a way to pay off their loans."

Sometimes my memory is as long as a few minutes.

Memories come and go, like switching between channels briefly, you know there was something there, but didn't get enough of a view to know what it was about.

Sometimes I remember, but can't actively recall (e.g. you tell me to recite a phone number, can't do it on the spot, but if I need to call that number, I can dial it). Doesn't always happen, and havn't found the pattern for the things I can/not remember."

2. What's your attitude/vibe like when going to Denny's? Also, what time did you go? When I was homeless I also didn't have the social skills to make even simple chit chat with workers. I too would get the stink eye. Like they feared you'd dine and dash.  Now I have an easier time talking to people (pre-planned conversation topics), and I notice I don't get that sthink eye feeling anymore. I don't think I've cuaght anybody looking at me like that in awhile."

just need to build up little by little.

I went something like, 

- first sleeping in a parking lot behind a storage container
- once I got a job, slept closer to work between some bushes and a wall
- started getting paychecks (and going to school, which meant a bus pass), started sleeping in company vehicles. Since I was away the first one at work (and opened), nobody caught on. Showered more frequent.Else, gave myself a quick rise down at work using a hose.
- Got a bicycle/storage unit. Moved stuff into unit which gave me a peace of mind.
- Saved enough for a junker. Still took the bus/bicycle everywhere. Used junker mostly for better sleep.
- Got better sleep.
- Took me a few years to pay off student loans.
- Student loans paid. Went to working part-time.
- Used extra time to work on social/interview/resume/new skills and to better sell my skills.
- Got better paying job.
- No longer homeless.
- Worked on getting better paying job.
- No longer homeless and can now start saving up for a future."
depression,fdm7687,t3_elycos,1578541467.0,"Can relate.

I feel I'm about 5-10 years behind my peers.

What they have accomplished years ago I am just getting around to. But at the same time, I also did not grow up with the same resources they did and was still able to do some things (e.g. go to college), so that feel like a triumph. 

My setbacks were mostly due to growing up in poverty. I didn't develop the social skills needed to develop relationships with people. Who would want to befriend the smelly kid that worse oversized handmedowns. Childhood was lonely. Actually, life was lonely until not long ago. I finally paid off my student loans. I was able to work fewer hours because I lived frugaly. I used that extra time to work on my social skills which lead me to interviewing better and getting a way better paying job.

I'm no longer homeless. Started the year off with no bills, no debts, and a full stomach. Looking back, I think povery lead my depression which lead a cycle of staying in povery."
TBI,fda6flc,t3_ej4of8,1578242277.0,"About 2-3 years I think  (can't remember).

It sure did help (was homeless partially because of medical bills), so having a car to sleep in was wonderful.

Now I barely drive. I mostly take the bus to work and drive my housemate around when she needs it. I'm so thankful the bus driver knows where I should get off because sometimes I forget.

Ironically, I can focus better when I'm driving. Maybe it's fear/adrenaline? I don't know."

What's your relationship like to your friends/family like?

I've heard of relationships getting sour because the debtor couldn't keep up with their payments to their creditors.

I say, keep them informed on your progress/setbacks.

I've been homeless for a long ass time and after that I helped people (when I could) improve their situations. One thing I noticed was between those that let others know of their plans/progress and those that didn't.

People like to see that you're at least trying.

Those that did seemed to have an easier time negotiating new terms with their creditors/friends/family vs those that didn't.  Things didn't come up as excuses, instead as situations that the person had a plan to deal with but may need to renegotiation how/when they'll pay a person back (e.g. like having issues with the car they're sleeping in)."

Does the plaza have roaming security?

I've seem them sometimes just drive around into other lots (not sure if they're also contracted for those lots). 

> there a ton of rental cars to hide in and around

I used to work at a place that shared a lot with a rental company (not sure if all locations did it, maybe because we were near an industrial area) but they did have security drop by (I know because I used to park near there). I suspect it's because people would drop off their cars overnight and drop the keys in an outdoor lockbox. There were also cameras in the area. Do you know if the rental place has cameras facing where you were parked? Maybe somebody  noticed something some time and decided to have security check you guys out."

Not sure how I feel about this (partially because I lack ability to feel emotions, is that a thing? Not sure). The majority of people I interact with are my coworkers and my housemate. I've made a name for myself at work as being pretty plan oriented *because* I jot notes and plan tasks far ahead of when needed.

I think that's why people are fine with me having difficulty with remember words in conversations, because they know if the content of the conversation is important I'm either going to be jotting things down (YAY  raiding the stock room for supplies) or I'll have them email me what they want and by when. The last part also helps with accountability for everybody involved."
