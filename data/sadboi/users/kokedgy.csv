You don't have any rights to be angry at her. You can't and shouldn't control her life choices.

Don't expect people to read your minds. I do that too and I know it's hard. You just want to feel super connected to someone - to the point that they can read your mind. But that is an unrealistic relationship expectation that will never be met. Realize that.

Don't be a fucking dick and put the blame on her when you were fully in the wrong here.

This post reeks of the mindset ""You have to adapt to ME, because whatever I say needs to be respected and if you don't respect it you don't care. You HAVE to change your ways to for ME""

And perhaps you just wanted to feel important. However you need to realize that this mindset is toxic as fuck. It's very immature and controlling.

Your relationshp seems to be full with unrealistic expectations. Change that."

BPD,fpra29s,t3_gf2ba9,1588847810.0,"Hear me out; this is your first step towards living a life that you can be satisfied with! 

I really feel you OP. I'm going through a really good workbook (The Borderline Personality Disorder Workbook from Dr Daniel J. Fox. I really recommend it!) and I've realized how much BPD has been controlling me through every actions. 

I've reflected a lot about my past relationship (the only serious one I had). I was really almost exactly the same. I wanted to start therapy in some way, but in another ways I didn't believe it would do anything. I didn't believe it would work. 

I only believed in the thoughts that I was presented with from my BPD. Only BPD made sense to me. I was craving constant validation from my then-bf. You see.. it's really harsh; but you will never find a good relationship with this mindset. Not even friends. 

You can't expect a relationship to work if you always point fingers at others. There are times where you are at fault too.. and that's perfectly fine. Everyone makes mistakes, it's human and helps you grow. It helps you become a better person. And for us.. it helps us to grow beyond our BPD. BPD is not us - we just have it. 

BPD gives us that comfort zone with an insane sharp double-edged sword. Honestly, I still feel like I can't change. The only reason why you think you can't achieve happiness is because you think you can't grow beyond your BPD. Think about BPD like it's your child - if you just leave them where they are, they're going to constantly throw tantrums. But if you pick them up, try to figure out what is going on inside their mind and help them find their right path into adulthood - that's when they mature. 

You can do it too. I fully believe in it! It will be a hard road, you might relapse again with full symptoms - but that's totally fine. It happens to all of us. You can't change your behavior with the snap of your fingers. 

But I'm proud of you! Even tho your BPD is telling you that you can't change, you still posted this on this subreddit and asked for someone's perspective! That's such a great step. I'm so proud!"

How can she be ""perfectly fine"" when she eats around 1000 kcals a day? She is tall as heck, that is absolutely malnourishment and will most likely lead to a dying baby. She can still lose the weight after pregnancy. Where's the deal?

So let me explain a bit more, her BMR is around 1400 kcals a day. She would have to eat that amount of kcals to just exist - just for her body to function normally. And she eats around 1000 kcals.. that's eating to lose weight.

Please tell your wife that gaining weight for your child won't hurt her. That you will work out with her after pregnancy. It's really important for the child. I don't know what else to say

I'm living with an eating disorder and being pregnant is one of my biggest fears. I really sympathize with your wife. I know how hard it is to knowingly gain weight and how much out of control that will make her feel. Please get her to a therapist. It'll only do good.

She is NOT perfectly fine. Just because she doesn't eat 500 kcals a day and instead eats 1000 kcals a day doesn't mean that she's not at risk. It doesn't mean that she doesn't have an eating disorder. Get her help, please!"

BPD,fpg6l20,t1_fpg5k04,1588595673.0,">This post and your comment are the exact reason bpd has negative stigma around it. 

I'm viewing it in a neutral way. The stigma is there for a reason. And it's because a lot of folks have experienced these in relationships. Though, I'm not saying we should be reduced to the stigma. But it's basically how BPD affects your life and your surroundings. 

Not all of us act like this, but that doesn't mean we should exclude the people who do. We know through a BPD's mind that we do not want to be abusive, it's not our goal to be abusive. 

But we have a tendency to hurt people and I don't judge others who want to avoid us. As long as they don't trashtalk us, they can have whatever view they want on BPD.

This video resonated with me so much & I'm having similar issues as you.

From my own experiences, my first relationship was 13 months. I really felt almost exactly the same.

The fact that your boyfriend is trying to handle you guys breaking up 20 times seems that he is trying to look forward to the future. Though I shouldn't assume anything, because he probably also has his fair share of faults.

But don't let your BPD overcome your own self. BPD is just trying to convince you that your beliefs are reality. They aren't; in most of the cases. Try to think about why you have those beliefs. What situations triggered those beliefs? And what can you do to not act on those beliefs?

I know it sounds so harsh and attacking; but a person needs to have friends. They need to be able to spend their time with someone else other than you.

I always like to think that giving people their own time will make them realize how much they actually love you! It's hard to be positive and it sucks a lot sometimes, because you might just get ""proven"" that your beliefs are correct. But please, try to stay positive!

I'm also recommending the guy's (in the video) workbook for BPD. It helped me to understand a lot more about myself. You have to be willing to change yourself though! It will make your life a bit more peaceful.

It's just that you need to remind yourself; they are feelings. They are your beliefs. And sometimes your beliefs aren't equal to what's reality

You don't need to stop yourself from feeling the way you do. I think doing that will be counterproductive in your journey of fighting BPD. 

We will need to remind ourselves constantly that in a healthy relationship (be it family, friends or a partner) people need their time off of each other. You can't be stuck together 24/7 and not get into constant arguments at some time. We need other people to talk to so that we get reminded of why we love the person we love!  

Think about it this way: If your partner wouldn't go to work, you wouldn't be able to surprise them with done chores that your partner would've needed to do after coming home. When your partner goes home, thinks about how he doesn't want to do the chores and then see that you've done the chores for them already - That will give them a warm fuzzy feeling.

BPD,fp99n2f,t3_gar668,1588419531.0,"Ouh that's gonna be a long talk.. 

I was diagnosed with ADHD at the age of, uh, I think 6 or 7? So, ADHD has a lot of similarities to BPD. I was always impulsive. Always hold friends a bit too dear to me. & I was always very sensitive to rejection (called RSD (Rejection Sensitivity Dysphoria) in ADHD)

So I'd say.. I was always the way I am now. But I suppose due to how my mom handled my ADHD, it turned into BPD. She absolutely couldn't handle the impulsivity (which is understandable honestly) so she used ways of trying to discipline me that she shouldn't have. 

I'm not going to explain the similarities between ADHD and BPD since everyone can just look them up themselves lmao! 

I think around the ages of 11-12 I became depressed. 13-15 were really strong BPD moments. I didn't even know I had it at this point. I would cry every night for hours, would self harm & look  for attention from others. I had every day arguments with my mother, fullly  screaming at each other. 

I went to the mental hospital at the age of 13 the first time; for 3 weeks. The reason why I left was because of a mood switch that I had. Thinking back, that was definitely BPD. Out of nowhere I went from suicidal to ""well, it's not that bad actually"" - until it was back again. Next time I went to mental hospital because I was actually forced to. I have not been going to school, so half a year later they demanded a letter for me to include a proper reason or else I would've been punished by being thrown into jail. Well I was having a huge anger episode, so I wrote that if anyone forces me to go to school I would murder them all (yikes HAHA)

From there, I barely even went to school. I'm 19 now and I don't have any school degree at all. I tried 3 times to get it back, but I always dropped it. 

When I turned 17 I started drinking. That went out of control quite fast, as I was drinking almost weekly. I've had periods of not drinking anymore, they were usually 3-4 months. By the time I was 18, I would drink continuously vodka. There was 2 month period where I was drinking 3-4 times a week. For now my drinking issue got a lot less - mainly because I fear the calories in there. A few months I turned 18 I developed an eating disorder. Well, I'd say I've always had disordered eating - but this was the time it because ""serious"" & more of a long-term thing. Especially after I started to willingly throw up my food. 

I've had lots of bad moments, but I think my worst one's were in my ex-relationship. I held myself at a distance with everyone I was talking to before that (to avoid lashing out at the people), so being really close to someone was obviously overwhelming. I got used to it overtime. Then the arguments started happening because I wasn't happy with the way I felt treated. I really tried to hold back irrational thoughts, but I was spiraling out of my control in this relationship. Beginning 2019 I tried to commit suicide 3 times in 3-4 months. After 6-7 months into the relationship, we started to have constant fights. 

September 2019 my family called an ambulance because I said I was going to kill myself. I was really drunk during that time & I don't remember half of what happened. So I was in another mental hospital (ironically this one is 100 meters away from me - didn't even know it was a mental hospital HAHA). I think around 2017 I've always guessed I had BPD. I was really sure of it and lots of my BPD homies were telling me to get that diagnosed. In this hospital I got diagnosed with BPD & and somewhat of an alcohol dependancy. During this time my relationship was extremely strained. And it continued to be like that until I broke up (which I highly regret now) 

Fast forward to now - where I'm standing. Few days ago I had one of my worst mental breakdowns due to my desperate need for love. I texted my ex & obviously he didn't give me that love. My BPD convinced me he would - so I got basically soulcrushed with that reality. The next day I had another mental breakdown - asking him to come back. He didn't say yes or not - but that change really needs to happen before we start the relationship again. This gave me push to actively work on myself. 

I've been trying to understand myself for a few weeks now - but now I'm always thinking about my actions & my BPD. I am actively engaging in my thoughts and feelings. It feels good, I gotta tell you!

i can only tell from another mindset by someone who has bpd, there is one thing that stands out quite well

""You're the one making fun of my show saying it's stupid"" - he wanted to do something enjoyable together with you, so you calling it silly probably made him feel like you call him silly. he felt REALLY rejected and also i think being turned down so bluntly made him sad

if i would hear that these thoughts would go through my mind (hope it kinda helps to put it into perspective!!)

""i just wanted to watch this show WITH you why are you calling it silly and stupid""""do you not want to watch it with me actually? do you hate me?""""do you think my humor is silly, do you think im stupid? why do you even love me then?""""i would do this for you too, why cant you do it for me too?"" (referring to ""think some of your shows are crap but i still dont make fun of them)

telling someone (regardless whether they have bpd or not) to ""chill"" or ""calm down"" when theyre angry is NEVER going to work. its not going to magically just calm you down

and (if this is really the way he explained himself) it seems that he was really hurt by you not wanting to watch the show with him. sometimes the arguments turn into nasty heated arguments, but this one seemed to be more of a ""i wish you understood me better"" sad emotional thing? omg i dont know how to explain this LOL

Now that I finished reading this. You need to put boundries up. This will destroy you. I can understand that you want the best for your pwBPD, but think about yourself too. You stopped living YOUR life, just to make someone else happy. That is not healthy."
BPD,fnrjz9u,t1_fnqg5b9,1587191360.0,"Uff, I was replying with this fully expecting to get bashed. I became super insecure about mentioning relationship issues, because I always thought that I'm just overreacting & that it's not bad & that I should just ""get over it"". Thank you for the award, I just woke up and it made my day!

I've bought a BPD Workbook but I haven't touched it yet. And I actually did ""try"" to get therapy - right after I broke up with my now ex. I called this clinic specifically for BPD & I got sent documents that I had to fill out. But due to the coronavirus it will get delayed by a lot. But other than that, I haven't really considered anything much.

I remember back when I was 15 I would let all my thoughts out to other people - but now I'm mostly just venting them into a document, or to people who I know won't tell a soul. Before the relationship I managed to handle disagreements better. Even when I get triggered, it's easier to not work up myself more.. because I don't have any connections to the person. It was like that for quite a while until I got into a relationship. That stuff made my BPD a million times worse ;v 

I usually just have a mental breakdown and it will fade out after 2-3 hrs. But I know that it's really risky, because during my mental breakdowns I feel like I'm losing all my senses and going insane. Luckily that only happened in the relationship."
BPD,fnq32nu,t1_fnq00dm,1587156749.0,"I don't even know what I was like before. I think in the beginning of the relationship I tried to keep my concerns down, because I could guess how they will end.

I have been going on forums, where people bash BPD. I know, sounds weird at first. But I wanted to get a feel for how badly people like me can make other feel. I have tried to understand this thinking & like I said in the other reply - I tried a few different approaches.

And no, I haven't gone to therapy. I didn't have the willpower for that. So obviously, a big minus. I really should've kicked my ass for the sake of the relationship. I have apologised lots of time (but of course, it never undoes the damage that I've done). I can't really say that I have done anything to change. Nothing really comes into my mind. I honestly couldn't even think of changing, because he didn't either. It's a bad cycle, because I think we both kept thinking ""if he/she doesn't change, why should I""

After arguments, I really tried my best in making it known in what ways his words would hurt me. I mentioned them & mentioned what kind of thoughts they triggered in me. In hopes he could in some way understand. I wasn't trying to blame him (during those ""rational"" discussions - in the ""emotional"" ones I definitely blamed him alot...) And, like I also said, I really tried to make him feel understood too

It always make me feel guilty writing it out like that, but I would've never acted out like this constantly if it wasn't for the fact that it all just got worse & worse. I really tried my best in the beginning of the relationship to make everything as clear as possible. Before we became a thing I told him I had BPD, I told him how bad it gets & I told him that I really don't want him to feel pressured into being with me. I mentioned my ugliest moments. I was crystal clear about my episodes. But since he still wanted to be with me, I really hoped that it wouldn't turn out like this. - I think I'm drifting from the topic again.

And during this month of ""re-contact"" I kept my things to myself. I didn't cause arguments other than the last 2 times. We had plently of space for each other too & when I got really attached again, I mentioned that to him but I also said that I know we both need space. And, I think I got bored and ""tried out"" how he would handle me during arguments again - in completely dissapointment of course. I shouldn't have done this. But I guess it was for the better."
BPD,fnpz6n7,t1_fnpr40l,1587154678.0,"I have tried to explain things to him clearly, when I'm not having episodes. I mentioned that it can be hard for him too, etc. I tried to be very empathatic and view things in his perspective. 

This question makes me feel a bit offended, but I know it's just asked for curiousity.. This circle repeated itself for months. And I had to beg him to please research more about BPD. It was very hurtful to feel like he avoided my BPD all the time. He even mentioned that he sometimes just forgets I have BPD. 

When I explained how things made me feel, he replied with ""Well. I know what I mean & I meant what I said"" and I can't handle these replies."
BPD,fnpaxhw,t1_fnpa7yc,1587142307.0,We all want someone who's empathetic & who accepts us the way we are. I think empathy is so important in a BPD relationship. When the person w/o BPD doesn't have much empathy.. shit fucking hurts

Seriously can't believe you dare to think that you have any right to spy on your kid like that. I can maybe understand wanting to know the location in case something might happen, but that would only be okay with a parent who doesn't fucking spy them at all times

You rules are all stupid. Wanting her to reply asap unless she's in school or practice? Who do you think you are? No dead battery excuses? 

What you are giving your child isn't love, it's paranoia. She has zero privacy
