I remember a point when I was low all the time but could never see myself ever even considering suicide. Now it dominates my thoughts everyday. I don't express this to anyone, my only outlet is occasionally commenting here. I don't want to bother friends or come off as attention seeking which I would hate. I've also sought professional help several times but therapy doesn't do anything for me. It's frustrating in a way because life is actually going fairly well for me at the moment, and rationally I should be happy, but Im just not. It makes me worry that I might never be."

Warframe,ey4wk3s,t1_ey4vi36,1566811897.0,"Not sure how your math works out to 90% but OK. A few things:
-I didn't say I was certain about the trin stats, hence the ""iirc""
-like I said, the 90-100 was for less intensive runs when you don't need to be too precise.
-Many chromas take deadeye and most experienced hunters I've talked to have advised it, idk what else you would run instead of it
-Like I said rubico is a good choice but Lanka is more reliable for newer hunters
-I personally use 427 but I would say 227 is just as usable especially for newer hunters
-husk/vigour are very helpful in stopping you from dying constantly when you don't have enduring tides yet."
Warframe,ey4txrl,t3_cvkiv0,1566807901.0,"The most meta team comp is:
 - chroma with max power strength and durability. Rhino's buff doesn't really cut it in intensive hunts, but in more chill ones hes fine, especially if you have a good riven.
-Trinity with maxed efficiency and duration, and as much power strength as required to max out blessings effect (Iirc its 145). Oberon has the added damage possibility but both that and is healing can be clunky to use.
-Volt with max duration and efficiency, also natural talent
-Harrow with max efficiency, natural talent and between 90-100% duration. If you're just doing chill hunts you Dont need to be too precise but in more intensive ones you need to get the duration and timing of covenant right so that the crit boost  is active when chroma takes the next shot.
For aura mods chroma usually takes deadeye and the other three corrosive projection in the most meta hunts. Additionally, 2 of the cp users should run coaction drift, not all 3 or you will remove all armor and lose the elemental damage bonus from radiation and cold. Always make sure to coordinate this before hunts (if everyone is using cp) 

In terms of gear you want either rubico prime or Lanka on chroma, i would recommend Lanka unless you have a riven for rubico. You want to build for multishot, crit and radiation. Also since raw damage mods don't stack well with chroma buff you'll ideally want to use primed cryo rounds instead of serration. Also on Lanka vile acceleration is really helpful.
On the other frames I just run rubico prime in case chroma messes up or something but it doesn't really matter.
For gear you want energy pads, I'd recommend large for chroma and medium for the others. Plenty of ciphers if trin or chroma for getting lures. Itzal, ideally with system reroute, hyperion thrusters and the range mod.
For focus like you said 3 vs and 1 uw. You also want to get as many unbounds as you can, starting with the ones for operator energy capacity and void dash distance (I mix up the names so don't want to confuse u)
For amps you want an x27, which means the prism doesn't matter, the scaffold should be tier 2 of cetus, ie shraksun and the brace should be tier 3 of fortuna (certus Iirc). The tier 2 prism of cetus is good for clearing vomvs and some argue its better for teralyst shields so I'd recommend that.
Also arcanes, for frames it's nothing special, guardian is universally good and if you have Grace or energize  they're useful. For operators you'll want a defensive arcane ie husk or vigour and either a second defense or arcane repair. For amps you'll want to use virtuous shadow for extra crit chance, which you'll trigger but dashing into the eidolons head so you don't waste vs stacks. That's about it for gear I believe, there's a whole bunch more to be said on strategy but you can find better guides on the Internet, and in fact I'm not sure why I bothered with any of this"

depression,exfqr6n,t3_cml6ni,1566246359.0,"I've begun talking to people recently about my depression. The thing is it doesn't always help, at all. Most people don't want to have to deal with your problems, and even if they do they don't know how because they can't relate. Of the friends I've talked to only one has understood my situation to any extent and was able to offer good support and advice. The others either did their best to avoid having to talk about it or just couldn't relate. It really upsets me because I want to talk about it but I don't want to bother people or drag them down when they clearly don't understand the extent of what I'm talking about. I guess that's why I'm talking about it here. Still feeling pretty bad. Recently the sadness has sort of just turned into indifference. I've been sad for so long that it's become my default state. I'm pretty indifferent to most things now, and as consequence I'm also thinking about suicide a lot more, every day. It's not that im seriously considering it, but I think about it, and the idea of killing myself doesn't really bother me. Im not bothered by the idea that my friends and family would be sad and feel guilty if I did, and I don't really care that logically i really shouldn't, seeing as I will probably improve over time, and there's really no point in cutting my life short. Well that last bit isn't completely true, because a slight belief in that is the one thing that's keeping me from wanting to go ahead with it. Aside from the intent, I think I'm pretty safe from suicide because I don't think I'll get to the point where I could physically take the steps required to arrange it. A fun little exercise I like to do sometimes is imagine what I would do if a gun appeared in my hand at a given moment. Sometimes I'm reasonably certain Id do nothing, but often I don't know that I wouldn't just shoot myself."
