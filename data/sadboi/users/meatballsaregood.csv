CPTSD,eyqs3pf,t1_eyq0q1w,1567352127.0,"I do think CPTSD plays a part. PTSD affects your cortisol significantly and in turn, cortisol plays a big part in your body functioning. There's also something called ""emotional fevers"", (I didn't name it) where your body temperature increases with stress. So if you're stressed, triggered, by hot temperatures and your body gets an emotional fever, I think it would affect your tolerance of heat. I hope this helps."
