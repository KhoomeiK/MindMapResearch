1. If it's a game that has a clear beginning and end, then I would finish the game. It's really annoying to find someone you enjoy watching and they never finish a game. If it's something like Minecraft, idk. If you feel like it's getting stale, then maybe it's time to move on. But if you're just wondering if people want to watch it, idk.
2. Everyone is going to have different opinions on this. I've currently switched to your titles backwards. No idea if that helps. More keywords is always a good idea, imo. It helps with searches.
3. I post 3 times a week. I do think I'd grow more if I posted everyday. I think that's something people want. But I can't keep up that pace. The best thing you can do is find a schedule you can be consistent with than push yourself to a schedule you can't keep and causes you to be all over the place. 
4. I don't remember. It was a long while, though. At least a year.
5. That's the age old question no one really has the perfect answer for. If you play games everyone is making videos of, you're struggling against a lot of competition. If you play games that have fewer people making videos of, you're struggling against the lack of people searching for that game. Best advice is to play the games you want to play and let your personality shine through and leave it at that."

letsplay,fnw3lqq,t3_g3zrfg,1587310749.0,"I have a few suggestions:

1) Consider cutting back your upload schedule. It know it sucks to do it. But you need time to take care of yourself right now. And if you really don't want to quit, then cutting back uploads is the next best thing. Taking off the pressure of needing to record and upload can help a lot.

2) Consider the games you are playing. I was running an evil campaign of Vampyr, which takes place during the Spanish Flu, and man did it tank my mental health. It was just the wrong time of year to play it. It was rather emotional for me with the character deaths being around the same time of year my mother died. And then COVID entered the scene, and the Spanish Flu comparisons were just no good.

With COVID, I've been trying to stick with happy, not dark games. And I was still feeling burnt out. Then I watched a video on ""Difficult Games for Difficult Times"" and how taxing game scan be therapeutic in giving you a physical manifestation for your stress and a method of defeating it. So, I booted up Resident Evil and started shooting some zombies, I feel great! So, changing up what you're playing could be good.

3) Definitely make your mental health your priority. It's okay to step away if you need to. Sometimes you need to take a break."
letsplay,fnw10ir,t1_fnw0elj,1587309215.0,"Looking at what someone's else posted, I used to play with a timer. And when I reached a certain time I'd say something like, ""That's all we have for now! See you next episode."" Then, I started playing an RPG, and it was a lot harder because the flow wasn't linear, and there was stuff I'd be cutting out. So, it was impossible for me know how much time had been enough. So I just played. And in editing, I put in cuts where I thought the video had gone on long enough but wasn't jarring. Transitions like moving on to a new map or game area. Or I'd say something like, ""Okay, let's go handle this thing!"" And I'd cut there, and that'd be a nice segway into the next episode. So that's how I do all my recording now.

I don't recap in episode intros. From what I've heard from the few viewers I do interact with, they don't watch on the day I upload. They wait a while for videos to build up and then they binge. They really don't need a recap of what happened last time because they are watching back to back."
letsplay,fnw0elj,t3_g3slbt,1587308851.0,"I have a full time job.

My husband has a couple scheduled online D&D groups (we don't have kids). So in the evening on Thurs and Sundays, I get about 2.5 hours of recording each. As my videos are around 30-35mins, and depending on the game and how up I end up cutting, that's about 4 videos. Three, if I'm doing longer vids or more cutting.

He also sometimes has a gaming group on Monday and Saturday where I can get more recording in if I want. Sometimes I do other personal projects or just give myself some me time.

My upload schedule is 3 vids a week, M-W-F. With occasional Sat uploads if I feel like I've developed a bit of a backlog and have a game that would fit weekly episodics. I could probably upload more often if I pushed myself, but I tried that one month and it just burnt me out. I do end up developing a backlog, and that gives me a nice buffer so if I'm feeling tired one week, I can put recording off and not be scrambling later. It's easy pace, and one I can comfortably keep up with, even if ideally I'd love to upload once a day. I've learned this is just the schedule I need to stay on to keep my sanity."

3. I cut out traveling unless something interesting happens. Or if traveling is an imporant part of the experience. In Witcher, there's a lot of monster nest to clear as side quests. And some point, I just cut it out because they've seen it 100 times already.
4. Depends. In Resident Evil, inventory management is part of the game. So I keep that in when I'm crafting and organizing. In Dragon Age Inquisition... it's just a major time sink. You could be crafting for hours. I cut it out.
5. I like leaving deaths in because it shows the viewer I'm not a super human who never dies. And sometimes they can be funny. They can also get repetitive.

letsplay,fmw4y0c,t3_fxq548,1586439626.0,"I don't have any effective strategies for you, but I can offer you sights from when I noticed channel growth:

* I'm a Dragon Age fan, and I have a tumblr solely dedicated to that purpose. When I did my Dragon Age playthrough, I knew people would be interested so I posted a couple videos, and I saw a lot of growth from that. **Takeaway: You'll see a lot of advice about growing a community within a fandom (not making a profile to spam your videos), and that's exactly what happened here.**
* Another popular let's play channel recommended mine to their viewers (among a few other channels) as someone they enjoyed watching and who maintained a consistent schedule. I did not ask them to do this. I didn't even know the channel existed. It just came out of the blue and was totally unexpected. **Takeaway: Another piece of advice you'll see again and again is ""produce quality content"" and ""maintain a consistent schedule."" That's what I've been doing, and people noticed.**
* I changed up my tags to be long form and to follow search formats. Ex, ""let's play dragon age inquisition female elf."" **This is another piece of advice that's commonly given on here, and does have results. And I can see those results in my analytics looks at how people come to the channel.**

I would also suggest being patient. I've been doing this for about 3 years. I only had a viewership of around 100 people before the Dragon Age let's play and the channel recommendation. Since then, I've been getting a new subscriber nearly every other day, and I'm now up to 342 subs. It's not a lot. But it is growth. My views per video have stayed around the teens. At the end of the day, I enjoy what I do and plan to keep doing it, no matter who or how many watch."

Removing them is something I struggle with as well. But something I've found helpful but is sometimes too cumbersome or too warm to do is lay a cloth over them to dampen the sound. Honest to goodness, that's the best solution I've found other than accepting them."

letsplay,fmlty6m,t3_fvi82f,1586193174.0,"You're being too hard on yourself.

You say you're enjoying what you're doing, so stop focusing on comments and subscribers, and focus on making content you enjoy. That's all you need to be doing. If doesn't matter if you do or don't reach thousands of people. You're still brightening the days of people you do reach. That's enough. 

You're the one creating all these negative thoughts that's bringing you down."

That said, it sounds like you may have mental health / anxiety / self esteem issues outside of that. And you need to work on those."
