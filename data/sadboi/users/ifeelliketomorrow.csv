I wouldn’t expose yourself if you just need to chat, just act like the average joe who needs help.. it’s that simple and doesn’t look like you’re searching for attention."
memes,fmsnwna,t1_fmskes6,1586359072.0,This comment is so confusing and not intimidating
relationship_advice,fmsh0yg,t3_fx31dj,1586355299.0,"I had an ex have sex with me when I was sleeping. Well I woke up during. I didn’t realize it was rape until months later. I just laid there and pretended to sleep. 

Before anyone asks: we had gotten a hotel room, he’s a marine and his base was over an hr away. Before we hung out I said we wouldn’t have sex or anything. We went out, went back to our room. I smoked a joint and went to sleep. I said he could sleep in the bed with me not the couch. And ya.

I think you should be alarmed by this but it might be my bias experience."

reactivedogs,fi5qril,t1_fi5o7yl,1582168670.0,It wasn’t for that. I phrased it wrong. We smacked him for chewing the drywall.
EatCheapAndHealthy,fi59060,t1_fi584xk,1582157643.0,"Definitely try it out!! You’ll thank me later! I eat the fried eggplant with pita bread and dip it in the garlic oil sauce. It’s tart but heaven, compliments each other sooo well"

EatCheapAndHealthy,fi56s0w,t1_fi3ey9n,1582156198.0,I’m really disgusted you said tahini is optional for hummus. That is the core taste!!! Edit that before these folks fuck it up😹😹😹😹😹😹😹
EatCheapAndHealthy,fi56p9e,t1_fi43cub,1582156148.0,Did you ever tried eggplant dipped in garlic pomegranate sauce though? So yum.
EatCheapAndHealthy,fi56m9u,t1_fi48qy6,1582156094.0,"Lol you’re thinking Italian food this is completely different. I honestly can’t name one pasta dish that’s Lebanese. We do eat a lot of pita bread but pita bread isn’t bad for you. It’s mainly veggies we eat, with meat."

sw5e,fghzj7q,t1_fghz3qk,1580799033.0,I figured this much. I just wanted to clarify! Thanks
bipolar,ffu9zdb,t3_eq9s5x,1580237586.0,"I love your room aesthetic. The plant :) sometimes the little steps make me feel like it’s a brand new day in my mind.

There’s a college professor that does lectures , his name is Jordan Peterson. He once said “a messy room is a messy mind.” Or something along those lines. Honestly my bi polar is SO much harder to cope with when my home is messy. It does make my mind feel cluttered! Relieving yourself from that clutter is healing💖

You’ll get through this. Proud of your progress!"
