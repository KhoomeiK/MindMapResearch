ptsd,fnmukox,t3_g2pvy8,1587078446.0,"I’ve had binge eating issues and the only thing was to not order in or buy too much at once. And to cut out chips altogether but not every treat you like. This is the only instance where my social anxiety/agoraphobia has actually helped me but it’s like quitting a drug for sure.
Edit: Just want to add that I’m sorry you’re struggling. Have you tried calling your pcp to ask about support resources? I work for one and many are able to have phone appts right now and maybe it could even be just a regular call I’m not sure but maybe worth trying if you haven’t and are comfortable."

Anxiety,fmv0luy,t3_fxksht,1586403163.0,I’m so sorry you’ve been waking up like that and went through that. My mother and exes publicly humiliated me (exes on purpose) multiple times so can relate. And I still have flashback dreams that leave me feeling depressed and anxious. I’m not sure what to do but it seems like you’re really suffering so might be good to get a call with a doctor over with or try just contacting your pcp/gp about the nausea/diarrhea- they could likely prescribe a mild anxiety med at least. I might try that app Calm- maybe look into something like that or meditation before bed?

Agoraphobia,fkdddo0,t1_fkd6cay,1584074966.0,I think it helps to familiarize myself with the surroundings and almost feel like I’ve been there before even getting there. It’s sort of cutting out one unknown part of a situation and making the whole outing a little less overwhelming. Also I get major anxiety if I can’t find a place easily so helps that as well...

It does get better and better and you will start to feel like yourself again though the more time goes by. Do things you loved before knowing them, treat yourself to something delicious or go watch something that’ll make you laugh. You deserve it. You aren’t damaged. But you can heal. It’s a long process and PTSD is so hard to manage and understand, but all the work is worth it despite the harder times.. I’m feeling pretty low too lately and along/like most people in the world just don’t understand, which they don’t, but we can still be here for others who’ve gone through similar abuse.

I had a guest who was triggering me- luckily I had to work so was able to get out of the house at times and that was key for me, seriously saved my sanity.

I remember at the lowest point for me, I was begging him not to ever hit me again and having to justify why it was bad and that it made me feel like less than a person.

The other day I was walking along the beach near my apartment and I saw a seagull that looked dead up on the shore. I went over to see if it was alive and it was- it looked like her back legs might've been broken as she was just sitting there and they were awkward backwards and motionless. I tried to speak softly as I approached and filled up a shell with some water from melting ice and she let me pour it down her throat. I also tried to feed her some chips I had, crushing them up and attempted to put them in her mouth- she chewed a bit but I'm not sure she really swallowed anything. I wasn't sure if I should've called animal control and worried all night about her, kicking myself for not bringing her home or doing something more. Then I went back the next day and she was gone. I'm hoping she was just resting and was able to fly away or animal control took care of her. Let's go with the former."

Getting into a really good podcast especially one I follow and feel nerdily like I know the podcaster helps me a lot when in public / social stations like that.

I definitely still want the ideal version of my mom at times and still wrestle with the fact that she just isn’t that way and won’t work on herself to be that way. I just feel so sad for younger you and had many lonely nights like that growing up. But you have every right to your own feelings and it sounds like you’ve come a long way with seeing things through an adult lens like that. It hurts, but is so validating.

I found I was going to certain people like this when I needed the same thing you did and ultimately, validation, which is exactly what I wasn’t getting from those people who I was essentially laying my emotional vulnerable self out to be walked on or maaybe empathized with slightly. It’s kind of dangerous really. One of the best things I did in addition to seeing a therapist was to withdraw from those people, who were not friends but in my situation were actually emotionally abusing me. Protect yourself!

Really though the ones I’ve kept after this moved away but I’d shared enough and made enough connection at those meetings, lunches, events, etc., that we kept in touch and text and Skype. Mind you, I got lucky and met two people with anxiety issues who are open and supportive, but if you keep trying here and there, even awkwardly, good people will find you/vice versa.

That sounds so painful, but that's really great that you have found that strength to be done. You are strong, and do not deserve any of that garbage. If you have anywhere to stay or anyone who might be able to help you get away from him if you can't get rid of him, I would ask for help. It's all about you (and your babe) now. Sending you hugs and tons of support ❤️"
