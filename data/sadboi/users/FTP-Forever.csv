I have a really great emotional support dog. His name is Wallace, and he is an Australian Shepherd, having him is extremely helpful. I’m forced to get out of the house, and take him for walks, so I spend time in the woods, every day, running or walking with him, and that’s a very good distraction.

You can probs keep it relatively simple the first time, make sure there is a decent amount of foreplay, it takes women a little longer to get physically aroused and feel ready for sex, than it does a man. So like after you make out for awhile, and do some cool hand things, like finger her, but don’t like finger bang her pussy, ok, like it’s cool to slip some fingers inside, and go at that for a sec, but your main focus should be the clitoris. Find it. Love it like it is the best most amazing thing you have ever touched, and when you’re done touching it with your fingers, try using your tongue, if she’s cool with it, and lick it, suck it, whatevs, but don’t bite it or anything, unless she’s asks you to, haha. Anyway, just make mouth love to your girls clit, that’s all, and maybe she’ll give you a beejer for a minute, and then things will progress in a blur of hot sweaty buttsss and toddies, and before you know it, you’ll be doing the sex. Start slow, and don’t be scared to ask her what she likes and don’t be afraid to tell her what you like.
