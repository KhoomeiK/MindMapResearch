AnxietyDepression,fcr13a3,t3_eijc8v,1577895207.0,"Hey buddy. What you wrote really resonated with me(32M), it‚Äôs like I went back in time 15 years and I wrote it.
Since I never managed to solve all these problems anywhere near that point in my life, only decades later, I can only say don‚Äôt lose hope. And if you want to figure yourself out in terms of career/studies....etc try to find a different perspective, look at stuff that you like to do for hobby, if you don‚Äôt have many hobbies, then try stuff out. Then look for ways in education(or outside education, as you can have good jobs without a degree) that puts you into that path, it helps, cause at uni you‚Äôll be pushed, and if you‚Äôre reading about stuff for your studies that you are interested in, it‚Äôs not studying any more, it‚Äôs fun. 
Depression and mental health and stuff is difficult to fix, try natural stuff, like L-Theanine supplement. But if there is a chemical imbalance in the brain that can‚Äôt be fixed with exercise and lifestyle changes then ask your doc for a trial of antidepressants. 
I‚Äôm pretty sure if I was shown to a psychologist at the time and been given treatment my life would have taken a totally different path, maybe I had wife and children by now.
As going back for life goals, study, job.....etc I felt the exact same at your age, I really only cared about playing football and playing video games. I got diagnosed with asperger‚Äôs syndrome, social anxiety, generalised anxiety disorder in my 30s only. And I only managed to figure out what I want to do in my late 20s and moved to another country by then(from Hungary to UK). You would save yourself a lot of suffering if you managed to do these things earlier. But don‚Äôt feel bad if you‚Äôre progressing slower than others. There was no reddit back in my day(not much internet either) but I think this is what I would have told myself I think."

socialanxiety,ezx41f7,t3_d2mis5,1568231577.0,I‚Äôm even worse. Because of my anxiety I already try to put the card in and pay while I‚Äôm still packing my groceries in my bags because usually thhe cashier is faster at scanning than me at bagging.
AnxietyDepression,ezg2d00,t3_d0zmba,1567889823.0,"Me too, all the time. That‚Äôs why I have no friends any more."
Anxietyhelp,eyebj6g,t3_cwkk12,1567031474.0,"Try to have on your break things that you like, such as chocolate maybe or a coffee or ice cream. And try to do breathing exercise, get an app for it on your phone. Every little thing could help, depends on how you feel on the day. Sometimes it‚Äôs hard to find things to hold on to. Try to plan ahead. Drink plenty of fluid, preferably something more than water as anxiety burns a lot of energy, so at least some kind of juice. Chewing a gum might help too.(depends on what your job is ofc if it‚Äôs customer facing or not) I even take a clean underwear to work and change midday if I don‚Äôt feel good(sweaty balls), it helps.
These are the things that help me that comes to mind right now, but everone is different."
AnxietyDepression,exe4qzf,t3_csavex,1566198337.0,"Didn‚Äôt really get much effect, even though I was using Provacan high concentration one, so it wasn‚Äôt cheap either. I think it‚Äôs important to note that I tried alongside my zoloft(sertraline), so I will try again when I‚Äôm off the med. Tried sublingual, and also in coffee,water. (I think I felt something when it was in a drink)"

Anxiety,eppn876,t3_bvg2hn,1559385744.0,"Yes, but as not much since I started taking anti-anxiety medication. Someone above described it as when the rollercoaster drops, I‚Äôve never thought of it like that, but it‚Äôs actually very similar. Anyways, it still happens, when I need to go somewhere new, or just at random moments. My heartbeat gets faster I think.
Unfortunately, it‚Äôs not ‚Äúbutterflies‚Äù or anything nice, it‚Äôs not normal. It‚Äôs anxiety symptom. Well for me, it‚Äôs normal."
depression_memes,ep5ufuq,t1_ep4k1pf,1559061010.0,"Same here, it‚Äôs frustrating. Try to find other stuff to do. I started an online Bsc degree, so that keeps me busy. But it‚Äôs maddening that I have a good gaming pc, and lot of brand new games, which I all find boring.
I also bought a bike, haven‚Äôt had one for 2 years, gonna do some biking trips. So these, maybe I gave some ideas."
