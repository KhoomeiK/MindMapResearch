Parenting,fi3u9vq,t3_f63ad8,1582127784.0,"I work in acute psychiatric care with adolescents (and adults, but adolescents are my strong suit). If you have any questions or concerns, my inbox is always open. It's never easy to take your child in for even an assessment. Often times parents feel guilt and even failure. I hope you know that getting help for your kiddo is the best choice you could have made and you are absolutely not a bad parent for doing the right thing with for them. It's also much more common than you think! Many children and teens struggle with behavioral problems and often need therapy and sometimes medication to manage this. It's the same as getting a diabetic child the help and resources they need; your child has a (mental) health problem and you are getting them help.

So good job for doing the right thing. Too often parents convince themselves that their child doesnt need help for mental health. I'm incredibly proud of you and every other parent that understands their child's needs and strives to meet them. Good luck.

Also: dont be discouraged if your child isn't a brand new, perfect person when they get out. I've had many patients be hospitalized more than once before finally making a breakthrough in treatment. It's hard sometimes for teenagers to truly understand the long term consequences for their behavior and to stop thinking errors; they are comfortable in their illness and breaking out of that is hard. Be patient. Do outpatient therapy when they discharge. Continue encouraging and supporting them in treatment. You got this!"

ptsd,fg9e1h4,t3_exiu04,1580637501.0,"Not specifically from it but contributed to it. When I was 9, I my mom beat the shit out of 4 grown police officers AFTER being pepper sprayed...not a good thing to do, but definitely a display of her physical abilities. At 19, I would get a text at work saying she had fallen down and urinated on herself trying to get to the bedside toilet, or have to play along with whatever year she thought it was; usually she thought I was around 14, still living at home, and doing homework (aka paying her bills). Its a lot of change in 10 years, most spent apart. She had hospice nurses but my brother and I did most of her caretaking. I will never forget her face when I saw her dead, or before her cremation.
Its traumatizing but harder to truly see and process until time has passed and you can look back at the full picture."

My hometown is now named on the sign entering it after a Special Olympain medalist. She is low functioning. Through middle school and especially high school she began to make a lot more friends as we grew older and learned more about socializing with people who are different than us. 

Another low functioning boy ended up graduating high school and was the star of the town for it. He still lives at home but I believe he does have a girlfriend who is also low functioning. 

Honestly, I think teenagers, especially as they get older and are taught about empathy and diversity, are very likely to see those awesome things in them. I remember several kids in school with various disabilities both physically and mentally, and what they were known for. Art, music, basketball, painting...

I'm bad at explaining and conveying things. I'm so sorry for the chapter of life yall are in right now. But I also hope you know that there's light at the end of the tunnel and people who can help you get there. Look up some local mom groups of autistic and disabled kids, even on social media.

creepyencounters,fcw4atr,t1_fcw1b64,1578016823.0,"Heres my first sociopath encounter at work! Not incredibly eventful, but was interesting as a newbie. 

In my first month or so of working in the field as an aid I encountered my first sociopath patient. Nobody else wanted to work with him, so I did. Largely because I was curious about him and why everybody hated working with him. He was in his late teens in a group room with about 10 other teenagers of various genders and backgrounds. The patient himself was very charming if you didnt know better, and attractive. He wound up convincing his peers to all charge and attack the staff member assigned to the group room, snatch their radio before a code was called and let him take the badge to run. Hed even planned it down to the best place to do so to ensure a successful escape and how to lure the staff where he needed them to be for the best results. All of them knew that they would benefit in no way from this. In fact, they all would have suffered severe consequences, possibly even legal charges, and lengthen their stays in the facility. Yet the sociopath was still able to not only convince them to do this for him, but to be happy to do it, and angry with the staff for preventing it. Thankfully we found out before it happened and divided the kids up to prevent it in the future, as well as all staff being advised to conceal their badges. While 1:1 with him, he tried very hard to get me to talk to him about myself. He was incredibly slick, but I was cautious with every interaction we had, and always assumed there was a motive behind what he asked or said. I didnt entertain him in the least and gave him no extra attention, either, except what I was obligated to for the sake of not being a dick and maintaining therapeutic boundaries. He hated it. I infuriated him because I wouldnt play in to his games, but he was also smart enough to know better than to say or do anything that I could chart and affect him negatively. So he would resort to trying to make me uncomfortable without outwardly doing anything wrong. Still charted the behavior and the treatment team saw through him. No idea what happened after he discharged, but he made for an interesting week at work."
