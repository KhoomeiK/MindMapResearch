Perfectionism doesn‚Äôt always mean what people think it does‚Äî it doesn‚Äôt mean being automatically amazing at everything you do or  liking things (your living space, food, etc) to be ""perfect"". For me it means checking through things a million times, beating myself up for tiny mistakes, or completely avoiding a task because i don‚Äôt trust myself enough to do it perfectly.

Coronavirus,fmzlipg,t1_fmzk010,1586523892.0,"in SF our mayor issued the stay at home order days before our first community case.  New York's came a few days later but it was after their first case and people (at least from pictures I saw) were not adhering as strictly to the guidelines. New Yorkers are stuck in closer proximity to each other in general due to higher population density.  

A couple more things I think made a difference: CA also already has a work from home culture and most tech companies in SF were already doing full WFH the week BEFORE the stay at home order. I also think Californians tend to keep a more stocked kitchen than NYers (due to available space and also cultural predilections) so once a lot of us hunkered down, we stayed hunkered down."
