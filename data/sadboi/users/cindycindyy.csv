I especially love eating sweets and that made me feel like I couldn't control myself around food. It is also worth noting that I had a history with food restriction in my past, both physical and mental. Since you say you don't under eat, are you possibly mentally restricting yourself? (Ie: having thoughts such as, ""I shouldn't be eating this""/ ""This is so bad""/ ""This is my last xyz then I won't eat any more""/ etc.) Science has shown that when restriction is present, you will actually crave and want that food more.

I am blessed in that I overcame my past eating disorders and food restriction/anxiety, but it took a lot of work and incremental steps to realize that food is okay, that sweets are okay. As I found myself eating whatever I want whenever I want and however much I want, including sweets, the more I found freedom from food thoughts and anxieties. The more I felt free.

Not sure if this is kind of what you may be going through. Good luck to you. I'm here if you need, but highly agree with others in finding a therapist who may specialize in these matters."

If you have any idea what is wrong with the plant, or how to treat it please let me know! Are the yellow leaves on the bottom salvageable (ie: can it turn green again) or should I cut them off at the stem?

WeightLossAdvice,facf0v9,t3_e8fdrn,1575938228.0,"This is all personal opinion and a bit of what I learned from my experience with food/exercising.

It sounds to me you aren‚Äôt eating enough. I immediately perked up at your description of ‚Äúsmall slice of bread,‚Äù and also noticed you don‚Äôt seem to be getting enough carbs, protein and fat. You are young, your body is still growing and you are highly active. You need to eat more food to sustain your lifestyle and to provide your body the essential nutrients, minerals and building blocks to grow and function. Don‚Äôt be afraid of any one food group. You need carbs, proteins and fat in order to function (ex: the ‚Äúsatiety‚Äù hormone is actually stored in fat cells so when you cut down your fat intake and fat cells you also lose bodily signals that try to tell you you‚Äôre full). You need veggies and fruits. Don‚Äôt cut out any food groups in an extreme manner. I understand that doing all this is hard, but eating enough is very important for your body to function, be as active as you are, and to grow. And in addition to all this, you need to eat for your soul sometimes. Eat to be and feel happy. It‚Äôs really all a trial-and-error process. 

I highly agree with others to examine your relationship with food and body image. Additionally, please examine your relationship with exercising/working out. Seeking professional help with therapists and dietitians who specialize in disordered eating / eating disorders may help as well.

Edit: Check our Abbey Sharp‚Äôs channel on YouTube. She a registered dietician who is highly knowledgeable about nutrition and eating! Her videos are fun, easy to digest and really informative!"
