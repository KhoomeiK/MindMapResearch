It's really weird feeling myself transition from never wanting to do anything but sleep, to starting to find sleep really annoying. Like I can start to feel the bars of the prison so to speak, and I don't like them.  


I have a long way to go, but if you told me how I would be today when I started seeking help, I wouldn't have believed you, because when you are deep in that depressive space you can't feel anything beyond how painful being awake is."

I worked at a title company with another aspy named Sean. They were awful to him whenever his back was turned.  


One day, I kid you not, they made it ""Sean Day"". Which meant that in addition to an ongoing stream of humiliating insults said so he could overhear them, they ""dressed up"" like him. They mimicked the way he walked. They pretended to talk like him.   


I was horrified. I went and got him a cake for Sean Day, which he appreciated.   


I am still floored by how awful they were, and I assume they were saying similar things about me behind my back.  


It was the sales team mostly, and they brought in so much money that they could get away with anything."

I hate waking up feeling like I wasted the day, resolving not to do it the next day, and then doing it the next day like I have zero willpower or something.  


Waking up for me comes with a sense of despair. If I try to care it hurts more so I usually shut down into extreme apathy.  


I have been going to the gym, and my rule is that it doesn't matter when I get up, I still go to the gym, even if it's in the late evening. Hanging onto that one thing is making things a little easier on some days."
