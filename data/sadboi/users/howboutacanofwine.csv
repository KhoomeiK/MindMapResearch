jobs,fnsx4px,t3_g3gt1k,1587230468.0,"I left my job of 9 years at the beginning of February, for the exact reason you're thinking of leaving yours. I left before Covid-19, not knowing what was gonna happen in my country. I chose my mental and physical health over staying at a toxic job I hated just because it paid well and it was convenient because I'd been there so long. I had no plans to switch to a specific career though, I just started looking at any open jobs that paid well enough for me to live comfortably. I found one after 3 weeks, took it, and I lasted 2 months there before I realized it was also a toxic job (and this is during the beginning of the pandemic). This other job was worse than the last, and I knew I couldn't stay, especially during a time when I should be at my healthiest, physically and mentally. So I left that job, too. I had enough saved to give me at least a month's worth of cushion while I look for another job. 

I guess if you want to switch to another job within your career field, this may not be the best time to do that unfortunately. But if you're willing to keep your options completely open, you can definitely find another job right now. There are so many companies still thriving, or even experiencing a surge in business and need people. It sounds like you have the qualifications to land another decent paying job, but it WILL take daily effort. I spend several hours a day on my phone looking for jobs and pursuing leads. Good luck!"
