AskReddit,fqywzyu,t3_glnbd2,1589756005.0,"Have to post this, attributed to David Attkinson:

In response to Bill's comments, General Motors issued the following press release -

If GM had developed technology like Microsoft, we would all be driving cars with the following characteristics -

1. For no reason whatsoever, your car would crash twice a day.

2. Every time they repainted the lines in the road, you would have to buy a new car.

3. Occasionally your car would die on the freeway for no reason. You would have to pull over to the side of the road, close all of the windows, shut off the car, restart it, and reopen the windows before you could continue. For some reason you would simply accept this.

4. Occasionally, executing a maneuver such as a left turn would cause your car to shut down and refuse to restart, in which case you would have to reinstall the engine.

5. Only one person at a time could use the car unless you bought ""car NT"", but then you would have to buy more seats.

6. Macintosh would make a car that was powered by the sun, was reliable, five times as fast and twice as easy to drive - but would only run on five percent of the roads.

7. The oil, water temperature, and alternator warning lights would all be replaced by a single ""General Protection Fault"" warning light.

10. The airbag system would ask ""are you sure?"" before deploying.

11. Occasionally, for no reason whatsoever, your car would lock you out and refuse to let you in until you simultaneously lifted the door handle, turned the key and grabbed hold of the radio antenna.

12. GM would require all car buyers to also purchase a deluxe set of Rand McNally road maps (now a GM subsidiary), even though they neither need nor want them. Attempting to delete this option would immediately cause the cars performance to diminish by 50% or more. Moreover, GM would become a target for investigation by the Justice Dept.

13. Every time GM introduced a new car, car buyers would have to learn to drive all over again because none of the controls would operate in the same manner as the old car.

14. You'd have to press the ""Start"" button to turn the engine off."

We went to the SPCA a few times trying to find the right dog. 
One time we encountered someone coming in to drop off a stray puppy, in hindsight wasn't best idea, but we took her home.
A visit to the vet found she was mostly healthy except for a case of worms, and we were given tablets to take care of the problem.

The puppy (named Sparky) was adorable but being a puppy needed some potty training.
Well day after the vet visit I was greeted by a very special surprise.

The smell hit me first, it was undeniably shit, wet unhealthy moist shit, it actually smelled liquidy. 
I thought to myself, okay no problem and grabbed paper towels and Mr. Clean... then I saw it. The puddle was a half metre radius (1.5 feet) and as expected runny liquid goopy poop. What I hadn't anticipated was the mass of writhing worms covered in the viscous fecal soup squirming together with a visibly lowering energy. I stood transfixed for a few minuted watching the dying parasites flopping around as the perimeter of the fecal pool expanded slightly with every slowing pulse of the wriggling creatures. 

I noped out for a bit, took a bit to collect myself and cleaned the mess up after the worms finally died. 
Since then never had am issue cleaning up gross things for some reason.
