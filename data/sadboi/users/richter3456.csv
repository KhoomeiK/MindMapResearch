Doom,fql066i,t1_fqkxu8t,1589441744.0,No. Couple reasons they can't do that. Breakable walls that require punching like the other comment mentioned. ALSO the punch does serve a purpose at staggering low to medium tier demons. Punching them usually generates a stagger animation of some sort giving you opportunity to shoot them point blank.

I haven't ever crucibled him that way. There's just not enough time to pull out the crucible before he recovers. I can only crucible him when he's stunned for a glory kill; but then there's no point. So imo ur way is harder
Doom,foq32zx,t3_g8oaky,1587981219.0,Easy way to kill him: lock on with triple burst rocket but don't fire . Shoot ice bomb over his head and he'll prioritize the ice bomb and turn his back to you. Unleash the triple rockets and he's stunned allowing you to unleash another volley and finish him off.
Doom,foq2zve,t1_foov1mc,1587981125.0,Very ez on ultra nightmare. Y'all do realize you can just shoot an ice bomb over his head and he'll prioritize shielding himself against that and turns his back to you.
Doom,folf6zl,t1_fokbl57,1587860931.0,Idk man for me cultist base was the hardest. doom hunter base after that is pretty easy since you can get ssg mastery on that level. After that you get two sentinel crystal upgrades at your hub which you can put into health to get 175 and it's basically smooth sailing from there.

Doom,fnxqrj8,t1_fnxck5b,1587344376.0,I would be fine with it too. I'm not complaining or saying it would suck if they looked the same. That being said I would still expect them to change the baron in some way. The imp still has changed made to his design despite it all and he isn't a direct copy paste.
Doom,fnxqn4u,t1_fnxo3xv,1587344299.0,Well i mean they can do it but this is supposed to be a sequel. 4-5 years in the works and the game releases and you see an enemy that's literally been copy pasted from last game with no changes whatsoever just shows sign of laziness with assets being re-used. I'm sure people would complain more. I would be okay with them doing it and tweaking the enemy a bit but logically I can see why they didn't.
Doom,fnxba6v,t3_g4afzw,1587335164.0,Forget the next doom game. What are they gonna do for the DLC then ? Re-use Eternals tracks or add new ones ? And if they add new ones will it still be MIck

Doom,fnpxuxl,t1_fnpu2c9,1587153976.0,"Yeah the Tara's Nabad sentinel crystal is in a very good spot as most of the hard fights are before it so you can use up all your BFG shots without having to worry.

For the first phase of icon of sin I started the fight off with one BFG shot to his chest armor piece..then immediately go into the left teleporter to come out on the top second floor. 

There will be another BFG cell at the top floor in the middle. Walk straight towards it while firing another BFG shot square into icon of sins face. pick up the bfg cell and fire a third shot on any other piece that you can . This is of course assuming you reach the boss fight with 60 BFG ammo . 
You just have to make those BFG shots count . Each piece of armor that comes off has its own animation of breaking so this takes up a lot of time and you can now focus on taking out the other parts with Ballista. He won't be able to attack you so you can use the jump pads to literally go point blank in his face and SSG + Ballista for massive damage. The key here is moving around the arena using jump pads and literally nothing can touch you. But make sure to keep note of the parts that are being destroyed . Because once he's done doing his animation he will attack you in which case you wanna keep your distance and use the chaingun. Anyway sorry for wall of text but that's all my knowledge for that fight lol. Good luck ! It's actually easy after you practice a lot on nightmare."
Doom,fnpsa4i,t3_g30rpp,1587151072.0,"I just cleared UN today and to be honest it's a lot more forgiving then doom 2016 as you can get armor back in this game very easily. Anyway here are few tips :

\- Always stay moving

\- Sentinel Crystal ammo upgrades replenish BFG ammo , so save those for late game as you can literally spam BFG in Taras Nabad and Necroval and still leave the level with two BFG shots

\- The first two weapons you want to fully upgrade are the lock on rocket launcher and SSG so save up points for that

\- You can get the flaming hook mastery on the SSG in doom hunter boss fight first phase as fodder is endlessly spawning

\- Upgrade mobility first and then Ice bomb for suit upgrades

\- The icon of sins first phase can be stun locked into an animation as you remove each armor piece. If done right you can practically beat his first phase without letting him do any attack"

Doom,fnik83l,t1_fnii55m,1586981434.0,Of course the game is suggesting that. I was just addressing your comment stating how your sick of the same sticky bomb animation and killing the cacodemons the same way; when honestly you can kill the cacodemons any way you wish. For the first three levels sticky bomb is the most optimal way to kill cacodemon but at the 4-5th level I stop using the combat shotgun altogether. If you sticky bomb the cacodemon all the way to the end of the game of course it gets repetitive. Find new and more efficient ways to kill enemies and you'll enjoy it more
Doom,fnid91m,t1_fnic4gm,1586978036.0,"Sticky bomb in mouth is probably only really required for the first 3/4 levels until you get the super shotgun and more upgrades. After that it's just easier to kill him with a ballista and one super shotgun shit or lock on burst. No one is forcing you to sticky bomb in mouth, kill the cacodemon however you want."
shmups,fn56gil,t3_fzlty5,1586657071.0,No it's a waste of money. Just get a raspberry pi and install retropie and then you can put the entire TGX16 and Turbo CD ROM set on there plus other consoles. And it'll cost you less.

Doom,fn0shl7,t1_fn0efp4,1586547891.0,Nerfed? The baron in doom eternal takes more then two BFG shots to kill. He's tanky AF and relentless. He moves around the arena more then his doom 2016 counter part and can catch up to you easily. There are many occasions in Doom 2016 where the baron stands in one place and just spams projectiles. Not to mention they go down with like two gauss cannon shots in siege mode. I appreciate that they actually made them a threat in Eternal specially on higher difficulties.

Doom,fm5v872,t1_fm58xgf,1585780631.0,It is very difticult however the building with three floors that spawns three tyrants and marauder has 3 BFG cells spread around so it helps
Doom,fm5uthc,t1_fm51ysh,1585780397.0,Honestly the AOE attacks from Kahn get a little annoying. Top that with drones constantly shooting you. I do know that the AOE attacks get worse the more closer she gets to being beaten. My advice is save two BFG shots for the last two bars of her health since one BFG shot depletes one health bar completely. Use lock on burst with ballista/chaingun to get through the first couple bars of HP. I haven't beaten UN myself but I've been attempting.

Doom,flphg57,t1_flpan4h,1585359570.0,There's an ez fix for this. All they have to do is program the game so it checks to see from the very start of the campaign if you ever change the difticulty mid-mission. so lets say you start a new campaign on nightmare and you get to level 5 then change difficulty to ultra violence. The game notices this and automatically disqualifies you from unlocking the nightmare only skin. This is also easy to implement in a programming aspect as you just need a single variable that toggles false

Doom,fl34vts,t1_fl348wf,1584768906.0,To some extent I agree with you. I think the whole weakpoint thing feels forced because enemies are overly punishing if you don't destroy their weakpoint. However if you truly did master the game you should be able to use any gun in any situation whenever you want. Their goal is not to restrict what guns you use on specific opponents; they are just trying to make you think more on what weapon you use so you don't mindlessly use the most overpowered weapon and spam it till you win. And imo they did it pretty effectively. No one is forcing you to use one gun; use whatever you want and if your good enough at the game you can make it work.
Doom,fl341d5,t1_fl33f2x,1584768097.0,It is similar ? Just enough and not too much but you still can't spam the same weapon and beat the game like that. Learn to master the game and it's gameplay loop and you can then live that power fantasy

depression,fjhslh9,t3_fdc6rw,1583354296.0,I haven't played red dead but I am looking forward to Doom Eternal in two weeks it's releasing.
