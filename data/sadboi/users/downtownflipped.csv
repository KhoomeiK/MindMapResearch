I have lost EVERY game with an AI player when I used to be able to sustain with them. Revert it. It's bad."

Honestly you can just open the conversation with HR casually. It doesn’t have to be extreme like “I want to move bosses ASAP” but more of how your boss bringing up your mental health is odd and concerning. Also document every time that it happens to cover your own ass with them as well. Send memos to a trusted coworker or emails to yourself. Good luck friend!"
