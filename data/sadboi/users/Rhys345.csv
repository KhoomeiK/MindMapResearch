I was diagnosed with MDD at 13 and had my first hardcore depression two years later on my birthday. I crashed HARD. My grades plummeted and I had anhedonia pretty badly. The depressive episodes got worse as I grew up. I started self-harming and planning suicide attempts when I was 16. I stole a broken power cable I found at the school and was going to try to kill myself with it before there was a bit of an intervention with my parents. Mania finally hit me at 19 when I started taking zoloft, and what a crazy time that was. I was a completely different person. I flew across the country, was top of my class in college, came out as trans to everybody, went on long expeditions into the city to ride buses and shit all around because it was so incredible. Life felt AMAZING.

A few months later I crashed hard and ended up in the ER. I saw my doctor the next day and that's when bipolar came up. I already kind of suspected it since I learned what it was, but I still denied it at first until I had psych testing that confirmed it. I was always a moody person even before it developed.

As for serious consequences I mean possibly losing your job, friends, getting hospitalized or arrested, jail, becoming seriously injured or worse, spending all of your money, going psychotic, all sorts of awful stuff that absolutely can and will ruin your life if unchecked.
