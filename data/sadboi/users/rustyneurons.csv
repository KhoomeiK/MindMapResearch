sad,fbgod79,t3_ed4bwa,1576854780.0,Are you kidding? Most people don’t love themselves enough to give themselves time alone before hopping into another relationship. That’s how much people DON’T love themselves.
depression,fbg7gts,t3_ed4x22,1576838357.0,"Honestly there are many physical side effects of depression people just 1) aren’t paying enough attention to notice or 2) don’t care how “sad” you are because they have their own problems. I know being depressed is more than just feeling sad, but most people don’t see it that way."
rant,fbg71fc,t3_ecrkyk,1576837740.0,Honestly I feel the same way “but family”... I’m about to return these gifts and tell them to fuck off.
depression,fbg6lvt,t3_eczhm3,1576837103.0,"Stand your ground. Don’t let them say inappropriate things and make you feel bad just cus they’re your family. Tell them that while you apologize for not seeing them on Xmas, you would appreciate if they not try to boast about it because you already made your choice and there’s nothing they can say or do. Family thinks it’s okay to poke fun and really get under each other’s skin but you have to cut that shit every time. No one reserves the right to disrespect you. If they say things like “remember that one year you ruined Christmas” be like “remember that Christmas you made me feel bad for seeing someone after a suicide attempt??”.. it might feel like you’re being mean or petty but you’re really just drawing a line and warning them not to cross it. I have to constantly do this with my mother and over the years she’s learned to respect me more and not say stuff like that so much. She still does, but I know I can stand up to her now so she doesn’t push it."

rant,f7aei2b,t1_f6vhufu,1573527251.0,"Yess I know exactly what you mean. I was stuck in the victim mentality for a long time and am actually getting out of it and have been taking more control. It is just really hard to plan something this big when there are so many different factors that come into play. I don’t think I’ll ever be fully ready to leave financially, but I do know that I’m not 100% ready right now which really sucks atm. I’ve been taking opportunities and trying to plan out as much as I can, doing what I can do right now, but I really don’t want to fuck myself over and end up in the worst case scenario (having to come back).. it’s just a really big step and it sucks that my home life makes me feel like I’m on a ticking clock. Like any moment I’m going to just loose my shit, ruin my relationship with my family, and move across the country. I’ve been going to therapy to prevent that kind of thing from happening, but it’s really hard to live in a toxic environment. Thank you for understanding."
rant,f7ae4aq,t1_f6vh680,1573526978.0,"Moving out is more than just a “stop making excuses and just do it”... if I’m not careful, I could end up broke and running back home to live with my parents.

It’s valid for someone to feel this way, especially when everyone’s situation is different."
