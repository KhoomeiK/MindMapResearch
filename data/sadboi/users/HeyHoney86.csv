dbtselfhelp,fqz9aw5,t3_gloqa4,1589762585.0,"DBT’s effectiveness is definitely dependent on what the bad things are... BUT the whole point is that it helps to build core skills like reframing thoughts and restructuring and slowing down our impulsive decision making processes. So it should be very helpful in your case?

I’ve found it really helpful while i have been working to stop any abusive traits i exhibited towards my partner.

Sounds like i’m dumbing it down, but basically, i found that not doing bad things is largely to do with splitting (for me at least).
For example, my partner might do something that hurts or that feels selfish or inconsiderate, but rather than immediately react, i should have been thinking: 
1. This thing he’s made me feel does not mean it was intentional - what’s happened on his side that’s contributed towards this?
2. Eitherway, whatever i’ve been through, does not mean i am “allowed” or “entitled” to shout or scold him. 

There was also a piece about making decisions that bring you closer to your goals which is great. So actively engaging with what you want and only doing things that bring you factually closer to that thing, rather than to erode the chances of it with destructive behaviour. 

Anything that helps you build a productive narrative in your head, will help to keep you from making bad decisions. I have pdf copies of the Marsha Lineham books if you’d like, let me know x"

BPD,fqltq5h,t3_gjfzwi,1589465895.0,"Exactly. I think it's really important to identify what those experiences were too if possible... And therefore the key people/personalities in your life that you consistently feel you seek out/react to. 

For me, i had always *thought* my behaviour was formed around the lack of father figure. My parents divorced when i was 15, i have had barely any contact with my dad past that point and cliché or not, I know i've always sought out boyfriends who place importance on the same things he did as a consequence. Ambitious, intelligent, approving of my work and career... If i don't get these things from a person i tend to take it as a personal failure.

But i now know it's been exposure to people with my mum's BPD/NPD traits that trigger my destructive tendencies, yet i tend to keep people like her in my life longer than i should because it's familiar and therefore comfortable.

Learning this about myself has meant now i can spot it, and enforce boundaries of my own to protect myself or at least limit my exposure to them. This change is uncomfortable but necessary to break bad habits and be happier."

Take care of yourself. Break ups can be pretty rough on self-esteem, so it can really help to have that little ego boost that comes from swiping and matching. I read recently that grieving the end of a relationship can be harder than losing someone in death. In both cases you lose a future, but when a person dies, it's not a rejection of YOU. Where as a break up is. So of course people resort to apps to repair that rejection and the way they feel about themselves, just be careful to not RELY on it.

Also, frustratingly there is no way of blocking users anymore (on Tinder at least) unless you match and then you can ""unmatch"" them. Seen my ex's profile 6 times since we broke up in Jan and it never feels alright. \*deletes app\*"
BPD,fqisv4m,t3_gj4qdf,1589400425.0,"I've watched some. I had thought It would help me acknowledge the crap parts of BPD that i didn't want to look too closely at.

Then i realised, *like that \_other\_ subreddit,* this act was counter productive. 

You quickly realise MJ is deluded. She claims she is a recovered BPD, but she just comes across hateful and self-loathing. Literally the opposite attitude to what will help you or anyone else cope with BPD let alone recover.

I'd advise anyone wanting to learn more about BPD to watch literally anyyything else! Start with this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JChwgwU9zIs) by Dr Blaise Aguirre. My very patient bf at the time had shown me it, in an effort to help me accept and love myself."

My ex was late to 90% of stuff and it used to trigger fear of abandonment, i'd end up being destructive and saying *""don't bother coming at all, it's too late""* because i'd want him to say *""oh no! please don't cancel!

My therapist recommended writing a big list of little things i enjoy doing, *(that aren't BIG things that depend on other people like meeting the love of my life, having babies or marriage)* and you know what, it made me thousands of times happier just being able to picture that stuff.

Use it as a sort of self love exercise? I'm being honest with myself and i'll write how i feel and if it gets downvoted then ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯. If i fuck up then one dumb comment does not make me a dumb person.

Be you! But just work on being secure in yourself. You should never feel bad about being honest and vulnerable."
Codependency,fpk7zw0,t3_gdtn3c,1588689752.0,"I cannot stress enough how important it is to be ok with yourself and therefore ok on your own. If you don't feel ok *either way,* no matter what happens with your relationship, then you are always going to fear being on your own... because it FEELS like a worse place to be.

I had enormous fear of abandonment. I suffered hugely with feeling disposable and unlovable. I was treated as if ANY single fuck up i made devalued the rest of the love, kindness and progress i had exhibited, from my perspective I had no value. Any happiness i felt was worthless. I could be dumped at any point, on holidays, on flights, at parties, when i was really ill! I felt SO unsafe and anxious all the time, abandonment dialogue running constantly in the back of my head.

Ultimately, that fear leads to anger, frustration and destructive tendencies if you don't deal with it. We broke up in January for good, he went from *""you're the love of my life""* to *""I never want to see you again""*  for real, 24 hours later he was on Tinder... after a 4 year relationship. In hindsight i should have seen all this behaviour of his was a MASSIVE redflag, and a huge indicator of what i had felt but not been able to prove while we were together... like, '*ah ha! I didn't feel disposable for no reason, he WAS treating me that way, and i WAS picking up on it... and this Tinder thing is proof!'* Splitting like that is not normal and he's a wonderful guy but this is NOT how someone who knows how to love behaves. At the time I couldn't see it, and i hated and judged myself for not being enough for him to stay. It's totally his loss :)

I know you say you have a grasp on your worth and the problem is engaging and dealing with those thoughts in the moment, so I think in that case i would focus on meditating on how **your partner is there with you** ***right now?*** He's choosing you, every day. You are safe. He's there to be with you and love you and create a future with you. Be present with that thought and build on it with facts and things you know. Know that he sees what you are, and that's why he's there. If one day he decides he doesn't anymore and he leaves... **you are still those things \*and more\* no matter what!**

Have you heard/tried the [CBT STOPP method](https://www.getselfhelp.co.uk/stopp.htm)? Try and practice this when you notice yourself spiralling (noticing is step 1) and engage with the positive thoughts instead. Eventual practice and this will become habit... and then after a while this will become part of your personality and you will be able to rely on yourself for reassurance. It's taken me 3 months of daily practice and \*6 hours of therapy a week!\* Yikes! but I'm there! And i was a total lost cause so you can totally do this xx"

I was listening to a podcast earlier called How to Fail with Elizabeth Day (it's great) and they also talk about how if you're *used* to applying yourself and getting those validating returns from it, like if you did well at school or whatever, you'll subconsciously expect that sort of validation from everything you put yourself to. 

Which is why it can feel especially painful if you try hard at something, like a relationship, and it doesn't turn out the way you expect. Any human relationship is not like a task, you can't control how it goes. It can be very hard to let go. Because you think, if i just try, it WILL work."

That means you want to improve on how this relationship went and that's **never** a bad thing.

I will say, two things i think that are really important take-aways from what's happened here:  


1. You've hurt your ex, and i know you've said things like ""it wasn't even a big fight"" but, sounds like, she'd had enough pain from someone she loved. In relationships we all have such different history, our lives are tapestries of different events that make our tolerance and reactions to things very different. It's important to accept that the hurt you caused her is real to her despite whether you feel it was acceptable or not... and now she needs time to recover, and she might not ever let you repair it. You need to accept that and work on yourself regardless, so whomever you love next only gets the *very best side of you*... and you owe it to yourself too, as sounds like you weren't happy either? Which brings me to...
2. True love waits. She didn't hang around for you to see a therapist or get help or put that work in. You deserve someone who wants you to flourish. Love nurtures and encourages. One day, you'll have a grasp on your anger, you'll be happy and know how to love yourself and you'll meet someone who is so excited to see who you'll grow into, but at the same time already loves you exactly how you are."

I don't know if this helps you, but if your ex left without giving you a chance to manage your BPD symptoms then that's not very kind. 

I know it really hurts right now, your fear of abandonment must be through the roof (just like mine) but if you're sorry for the way you treated your ex, ...shouting or maybe saying things you didn't mean in anger... then you owe it to her to focus on you right now.

And you keep going every day practicing until it becomes **habit**, and then you keep going until it becomes part of your **personality**... this takes time. 

It means first of all getting in touch with what you want and who you are, and what triggers you, and knowing where you need to be kinder with yourself. *(Maybe there are certain events or times of the year or things that always upset you and you are gentler and less critical of yourself at that time)*

I've been in your shoes. Me and my partner were together for almost 4 years but managed 6 months post diagnosis. I just wasn't able to make progress fast enough. I loved him, I wanted to SO much, but we kept arguing and it hurt him. I feel guilty for that every day. But i let the guilt stay present to motivate me to change.

We broke up in Jan, he self diagnosed codependent and has said that he wishes he had walked away sooner... which hurts because effectively that's like saying *""I regret being with you""* but i understand. We were dysfunctional and we hurt each other and nothing we tried at the time worked.

But if i had a wish it wouldn't have been to *undo it all*, it would have been for us to put the breaks on, notice/diagnose/treat the codependency, for him to start therapy sooner, and work on ourselves so we could have stayed together. BPD and codeps enable and trigger each other. Now we know, it would be different and i'm certain of it. But it's too damaged for him to come back now.

Please reassure each other of how much you want to progress and how much you are working and how much they mean to you. Sometimes even if you're not making it happen it helps to affirm the love and care you have. I was too ashamed to even talk about it most of the time so i didn't do that for him, like an admission of guilt.

I haven't  wanted to reach out to anyone, i wanted to let people know what i was dealing with and then I wanted people to be here of their own accord because then it feels *real*.

The reality is, I'm having to beg for time, apologise a lot, not cry, not be too sad, and not be too much. I'm very lonely.

Sure, I'll try a cancer support forum."

Speaking from experience, the best way you can support her is by encouraging her to get help to talk/unpack why she behaves the way she does when she's emotional. If you love her and want to keep the relationship, reassure her, **stick by her** and encourage her to talk about it with you too. Be a team. You guys vs the dysfunction.

Most importantly: **practice 'no judgement' conversation and active listening patterns.** This tends to be hard for codeps as they are reassured by being able to control a situation, so quite likely you are accidentally imparting judgement. The last thing you want is her feeling SO MUCH shame about her behaviour that she stops talking to you about how she feels. 

You def need to put some boundaries in - *you are not on this earth to absorb what she's putting out there JUST because you love her -* BUT because of your paternal position in the relationship, she is used to you being nurturing and this no-nonsense shift of you digging your heels in it will terrify her... and likely make her feel that you are pulling back from the relationship (which will make her behaviour worse) when it sounds like you want advice on how to repair it/make it healthy? so please make sure you tell her that. Often.

Explain that you are not willing to have her shout/throw things/manipulate you BECAUSE you love her and want a great relationship and future with her, ask ""how can we do that?""

But it's hard. We're both struggling. I know we love each other but we were hurting and there was mud-slinging from both sides, Fear of abandonment has been torturously painful, I've definitely been a dick and likewise some of the stuff he's accused me of since we broke up has been \*hellish\*. 

It's not a discard BUT I'm just going to work really hard on **myself now** and do the one thing he has always asked me for in the relationship that i had never been capable of doing ...and that's giving him space.

Firstly, really happy for you that you've found a way to work your way out of what can, at times, feel like a really hopeless place. This list is really inspiring and I'm definitely going to save it and refer back to it often.

Secondly, it's taken me about a year to realise that **progress isn't linear**. I had been trying to ""fix"" my BPD whilst in a relationship but hurt my partner. To keep him I had promised to NEVER fuck up again *(no shouting, sulking, getting insecure, cutting, projecting etc)*

The problem was, **working your way out of historical coping mechanisms IS hard.** And it's impossible to do it in a couple if you don't communicate. But I didn't want to talk because i was ashamed of admitting i was struggling. I couldn't live up to the promise i made, we argued and he left me.

I WISH i had made less promises about \*never\* fucking up again. I wish i had reassured him lovingly and often that i *might* make a mistake along the way but that he's my best friend and I will get there because i want to. **I'm making so much progress now that i'm being kind to myself**, but it's too Boy Who Cried Wolf to him.

* **No awareness of ego (Unconscious) -** *Fragile and overactive. Drives all behaviour. Disagreement feels like threat of self. Protection of ego identity comes before authentic expression.*
* **Ego awareness -** *Tuned into inner world. Able to observe ego stories (thoughts) as separate from self. Notices when triggered. Less attached to ego stories as ""truth"". Goes in and out of conscious awareness.*
* **The witness (conscious) -** *Practiced self observation. Able to notice ego stories and triggers consistency. Able to respond rather than react. Ego still becomes activated, but doesn't drive choice, habits, patterns or behaviours.*
* **Ego integration -** *Ego is fully strengthened (self autonomy) through acceptance of shadow self + all emotional states. Sometimes referred to as ego death. The awareness beyond thoughts that can observe all situations as the neutral witness.*
