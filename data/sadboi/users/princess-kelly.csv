All I know is my laparoscopy is the only thing I've had done and my mom insists this is not normal for someone under 20. Exercise helps my strength and muscles but it has not reduced the fluid retention for the past 6 months. Just makes me really insecure. It's the worst on the inside of the left ankle.
Empaths,fnhhdfi,t3_g1p3cx,1586962431.0,"I found the word empath at age 12/13 I believe, because I had always known I felt so deeply. I come from a Christian background but despite growing in opposite directions it has always been towards spirituality. Strangers always compliment my eyes and I struggle with maintaining eye contact for any period of time because it feels like I can feel the other person. I can usually tell if I feel comfortable with someone immediately and in the work world it has not gone so well. I tried to drop out of high school many times because I couldn't deal with mingling around 2000 people for so long, but my parents never let me and I have my diploma now, but I have felt so much more stable after graduating. Now I'm 19 and not sure about the future but confident I am going wherever it's supposed to be."

BPD,fn36gjp,t1_fn360rf,1586614021.0,I agree with you my point is just that it's quite obvious the users do not feel supported by certain admins and that's not being addressed. The comments discussing them have been locked. This admin is micromanaging to the point of making a decent majority uncomfortable which can be seen through the anonymous award given being done. I appreciate everyone who's engaged in critical conversations with me despite my current state.
BPD,fn35lqc,t1_fn34mlq,1586613423.0, are you aware of the fact a lot of people with BPD live in poverty? and also that a lot of American therapists illegally refuse to treat anyone with BPD on their record? because this is a genuine huge problem and there are no DBT therapists in my area whatsoever. My current one taught herself to help me recover.
BPD,fn3481u,t1_fn30zv5,1586612423.0,you sound very hypocritical. of course bpd people have split and said toxic things here. are you aware how many bpd people have been quarantined with abusers for very extended periods of time right now? there seems to be a false equivalency that I'm enabling toxic behavior because I think it should be met with empathy instead of more rules. constructive criticism can easily be given laced with needed empathy. they are not mutually exclusive.
BPD,fn33p2j,t1_fn311hg,1586612036.0,you literally just sound like an ableist CBT therapist right now. have you even heard of DBT? one of the most critical components is empathy towards BPD clients due to the very nature of the symptoms.
BPD,fn30myh,t1_fn2zmk4,1586609647.0,"so this is not supposed to be a place for support for BPD? what is it then? another place for the most of us quarantined with abusers to follow even more rules? these rules are restrictive and annoying, not being empathetic."

There is definitely a  personality disorder stigma in some American therapists unfortunately."
BPD,fn2ygml,t3_fyy21p,1586607771.0,"Yeah but some of these ""myths"" and ""facts"" are still your personal opinions. You can recover from BPD, and I know multiple people who have claimed they have. What that actually means is debatable but for many it means when you no longer exhibit 5 out of the 9 symptoms. Mania can definitely be a symptom of BPD and I'm getting tired of y'all acting like the DSM-5 is the end all be all for mental health information. That was released almost a decade ago and we have a lot of new information. I have confirmed experienced manic episodes, and my therapist says these can be a part of my BPD. So by implementing your personal opinions as ""rules"" you are invalidating a lot of BPD people like myself currently actively experiencing mania. You can do it if you want, but this seems like y'all are having an ego trip from isolation boredom or something, which tbh I am empathetic towards we feel very little control in life right now. I may be banned for this but oh well I have multuple support resources nowadays."
