I was just wondering today if my body's persistence in keeping soft rounded fat in lower belly/upper thighs/other places I find annoying were because of ""yin flesh""  . I find I need to get down to a pretty low weight (probably around 110 lbs at 5'5) for my stomach to be completely flat and show a little ab muscle . even when I'm lifting very heavy 5 days a week the softness persists, so its not due to low muscle mass. 
I think in my case having small bones and a narrow frame makes soft fat more noticeable than if I had the broad hips and shoulders to support it. 
Anyways, I too was wondering if there was any *scientific* basis for the idea of soft flesh vs firm flesh or whether I'm just eating too much still lol."

He doesnt make rules like that. .your ""lines"" are there to reveal and highlight your body and yin yang balance, that's it. 

I dont think age has anything to do with it, plenty of older women have great legs and love wearing minis. D's don't necessarily have ""big bones"", they are sharp narrow yang. I actually think a lot of D's look very delicate, and they can be any height. 


As for midis, I just don't like midis because they cut your leg in half at the largest part of the calf and it can look..stumpy lol.

I think its very probable your brain needs to rebalance, it can also really affect hormones and be particularly bad for men with their T. That you should def get checked.

I felt that perma-depressed-blunted-sad feeling before the drugs so I feel it after I quit as well, the drugs were to stop those feelings.
With subs it should help the physical PAWS aspect but emotionally , since you aren't getting high and feeling that , it'll feel shit.

Kibbe,fo8mzeb,t1_fo8lh2e,1587599748.0,"Well she has boobs but no double curves, no , but she also keeps herself extremely thin and has for much of her career .
I guess I just don't see anything blunt or broad in her , and thats always been my question..are shoulders technically being the widest point of your body enough to be a blunt yang/natural type? Like if nothing else is wide at all"

Kibbe,fo3kzef,t3_g5hd84,1587488655.0,You are correct. i don't look at his system as a clothing style rec system..its more finding your own style and appreciating your own yin yang balance instead if trying to correct it
