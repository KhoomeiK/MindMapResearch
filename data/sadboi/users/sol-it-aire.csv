For example, the ED center I was in for 7 months didn't allow us to say the word ""fat"" (among other things), so when I was suddenly thrust out into the real world after being in ED lala land for so long, it was pretty jarring to hear people throwing that word around, openly talking about weight loss, calories, etc. I'm not saying it's right to police other people's words, I'm just saying there might be a reason for it.

In my opinion, the opposite is true. When people limit themselves to only one sexual partner throughout their lifetime, they never get to experience variety and figure out what they like or don't like. I think this reduces their chances of finding their best mate possible because they've settled for the very first partner that comes along, and they never get the chance to become good at sex through practice before marriage. I always cringe at the thought of someone ""saving themselves for marriage"" because what if you get to your wedding night and find that you and your partner are completely sexually incompatible? You're fucked... literally. I would imagine this would lead to more divorces than getting to know your preferences before settling down."

Every night she would have these episodes where she would scream and punch herself in the face, and the staff would come and call her terrible names, say she's doing it for attention, and restrain her violently. The facility was filthy and I had to basically fight to get staff to clean (patients weren't allowed cleaning supplies, so there wasn't much I could do). My roommate would leave ungodly amounts of hair and sometimes excrement in the bathroom and sometimes it was weeks before I could get someone to come clean it up. I was there for anorexia (I was being held there until a bed opened up at Veritas, an actual treatment center for eating disorders), and the psychiatrist there obviously had no idea about how to handle patients with eating disorders. At one point he brought me into his office and handed me a picture of an emaciated woman. He told me ""This is what anorexia looks like. You don't want to look like that, do you?"" Although it seemed small, that really took a toll on my mental state while I was there because he essentially just told me I'm too fat to be anorexic (I weighed like 100 lbs at the time) and showed me thinspo. There were also random strip searches. We were basically treated like prisoners for being mentally ill and it was extremely harmful. That just scratches the surface of my experience there...
