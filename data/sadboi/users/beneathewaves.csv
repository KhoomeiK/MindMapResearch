crssdfest,fkyz2an,t3_fl30jw,1584659194.0,"OP, I agree with you full heartedly and commend you in sharing this post. It‚Äôs important for everyone to stay informed on what‚Äôs happening post-festival...keep us updated as you hear more! It really is a shame the festival left out those crucial details ‚òπÔ∏è"
crssdfest,fkv1mgf,t1_fkv0jgx,1584560226.0,"Better than nothing, buddy. Surely an e-mail before the event would have prevented some people from attending (you‚Äôre quite the cynic to believe everyone ignores their emails lol), minimizing risk of spread. Yes, this is all being said in hindsight and there‚Äôs nothing to do about it now but continue to follow what the officials and experts recommend/mandate. Stay safe!"
crssdfest,fkuztf1,t1_fkuyw8m,1584559237.0,"Incorrect- purpose is not to trash the festival. I‚Äôve been an attendee of CRSSD for 3 years. The purpose is to say that they could have done much more knowing full well that other festivals and large events were being canceled in light of everything going on. Yes, it would have been unrealistic to cancel it altogether, since the situation was worsening only a few weeks ago and it would have been extremely last minute. However, even a simple announcement or email asking people who have traveled out of the country recently or anyone feeling ill to consider not attending. If you‚Äôre going to run an event where thousands of people are congregating, there needs to be more done than just adding more hand sanitizer stands. 

Btw, I know several friends who attended so I‚Äôm speaking on my concern for them as well."

The time away was much needed and very healing. When I returned to school, I had some setbacks but made it through and came out with that darn degree!

You'll find some challenging days, but continue to push through and always remind yourself that you've made great strides to get to this point! It's wonderful that you have a supportive boyfriend who is always there to encourage you :) but also, don't forget to turn to yourself and see that you have an enormous strength that is always encouraging you as well.

Congrats OP, keep at it!"
