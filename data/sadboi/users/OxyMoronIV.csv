I quit for 2 or  3 years when I was diagnosed, and Im much worse off without it. If I was a new smoker, it would probably make me anxious, but since I've smoked for so long, I no longer get those anxious/paranoid highs, ever. It numbs me to my positive symptoms, and almost erases my negative symptoms. It truly has been a godsend and one of the only drugs that has ever helped my mental state. I 100% understand the issues with using psychoactive substances with Schizophrenia, that being said, both my primary doc and my psych doc gave me the green light to continue using marijuana (no pun intended Lol). SIDENOTE: Kratom does absolute wonders for negative symptoms. Works better than any SSRI or benzo Ive ever been on. Ive taken it daily for years. Much safer than most pills. I do not take any prescribed meds for schizophrenia."
