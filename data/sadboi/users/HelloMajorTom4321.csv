CPTSD,fq4x8z3,t3_gguzgq,1589086428.0,My first therapist shared with me something that helped me begin the change in my thinking. She told me that black and white thinking is a cognitive distortion. But what do you get when you mix black and white? Gray. All life is gray.
CPTSD,fq42076,t3_ggqgg2,1589072810.0,I feel this. You have my empathy.
ptsd,fpuhsgc,t3_gfc37l,1588913243.0,"I’ve done acid and I’ve done mushrooms. I did them before I knew my PTSD diagnosis and after. I am interested in psychedelics for PTSD. I can’t say that it will cure it, since I’m not a doctor. There are people out there who are looking into it, like MAPS, and I am interested in what will come to fruition. Not because I wanna get high, I just want to get better. I wonder if psychedelics will someday be treated like other medications... and that each type of psychedelics will be beneficial on a case by case basis, as each person’s trauma/ptsd story is different, so will be the treatment.


I think all psychedelic experiences will come down to the mindset/thought patterns of each individual. I really think that you have to have a strong positive mindset through the duration of your trip. It is true that any small negative thought or interaction can spiral into a bad trip. Once on acid I forgot I was wearing a Marilyn Manson T-shirt where he has smeared lip stick. It startled me, and I had to be quick on my toes- I reminded myself that it’s just a t shirt, it’s just his make up, and I told myself a silly joke, “oh he had cherry pie and got it all over his face.” Dorky, but it helped me. 


I also think that the quality and or purity of the psychedelic should be taken into consideration. 


And lastly, if you’re taking psychedelics, your trip will depend where you’re at and who you’re with. The trip will be different depending on your surroundings. Are you at a concert and could that trigger something else like agoraphobia, claustrophobia, paranoia? 

Who are the people you’re around when you dose? Are they people who are kind? Could they be chill enough to be there incase your trip goes bad? Maybe consider getting a “designated driver,” per say? Maybe consider tripping at home with a few friends?

When I’ve done acid... everything seems very real. It’s like everything is in a high resolution. Depending on how much you take... you can see things morph and it can be a bit scary. It’s like everything is approached with mystery? It’s like, “whoa... how does that happen?”

When I’ve done mushrooms... everything I see my mind approaches with a child like wonder. It’s easy to be giddy, and chipper. It’s like, “wow... that’s so awesome.” 

The last time I did acid, it lasted 12 hours... but the side effects felt like a hangover, I think it lifted my depression for a month?

The last time I did mushrooms, it lasted 10 hours... side effects for me was some queasiness, I felt off balance the next day. I felt chipper for about 2 weeks after. But then my body slipped back into my “regular,” depression and it just felt hard to deal with. I was irritable.

I think both of these are powerful drugs and affect people differently. 

These are just some of the experiences I have had.

Again, not a doctor. I can’t tell you what to do, but if you do...please consider dipping your toes first, don’t jump into the deep end of the pool."

CPTSD,fecppc7,t1_feckupr,1578980181.0,"Yes! I've had to teach myself other basics too, like how to do my hair and make up. I've had to figure out basic hygiene. I've had to figure out what is and isn't appropriate clothing for formal occasions- things that are appropriate or expected to say. I've googled proper etiquette for events.

Money is another topic I know nothing about. I'm an adult now and I feel so unqualified and unprepared as to how to handle money. Since I've had to take care of myself for so long, I've always shopped at the cheapest places just to survive. I've managed to use money as a tool to survive, and I've figured how to save a little bit by penny pinching, but I have no experience as to how to make my money grow or how to even allow myself to enjoy something even for my birthday.

Thank goodness for google and secondhand shops."

Thank you for reminding me that my issues are valid."

I've wondered if she's snapped at other clients. Or if my personal experiences have been shared with other clients. Also, I can't report her to her boss as she is self employed."

CPTSD,febedzu,t3_eo9v7a,1578957995.0,"Yes. For me personally I was thrown into the adult world as a child and never got to be a child. It was purely out of the necessity for survival: learning how to cook, do my own laundry, take care of myself and take myself to school, keep myself accountable, book my own doctor and dentist appointments and had to do my own paperwork and figure out how to pay for it. As soon as I discovered what Google was- that became one of my greatest life resources. It still is. Google has been amazing to me."
CPTSD,feap7w5,t1_feaieip,1578951002.0,"Also, sorry to hear that the therapist you were seeing pretty much blew through your time. Literally, \*your\* time to meet and talk about important issues. And not just your time, also your money. Because therapy isn't free either."
CPTSD,feao7uc,t1_feaalov,1578950782.0,">The whole thing about therapy is that you're there to work on your recovery, your therapist should never ever ever talk about their own problems to you and expect your support, their job is to support you. Yes they can talk about their life a little bit - that's normal - but you should NOT know this about your therapist.

Yes, Yes to this! This is my second therapist. My first therapist I saw for CBT and she was awesome. I sincerely miss her kindness and her company as a therapist. And see, even though I miss and appreciate my first therapist I always knew that she was just that- my therapist. She never told me personal stuff or mentioned tidbits about her other patients, she was professional. And even through professionalism she was able to help me open up and talk about stuff. Which is something my second and current therapist hasn't been able to do while doing EMDR. 

This whole time I've been told that I am not receptive to her. Which is frustrating to hear because I have told this therapist so many traumatic and personal things that not even my closest friends or significant other know.

I've been told that I have walls up- which I definitely do since I've experienced trauma... and I want to work on those things. And I do the work! Maybe my 'spidey senses' were trying to tell me something and this recent situation is just the eye opening experience needed to tell myself to let this therapist go?"
CPTSD,feakr63,t1_feaieip,1578949950.0,"I have had appointments so similar to what you're saying! There have been appointments where she spends more time talking about herself and her frustrations with other patients. For the most part she has kept stuff vague, and I try to change the topic as soon as I can. Because its uncomfortable, and I've always thought that I was being told things that are not my business.

But there has definitely been times where she's told me that she was tired coz her previous appointment was a couple who were saying nasty things to each other. She's also had moments where she tells me that she's overwhelmed because she has so many appointments, or another time she was telling me about a patient who suffers from schizophrenia, who was insisting that someone broke into his house just to steal his ID, and only his ID. And then she proceeded to ask me if I have any thoughts like that or if I thought I have schizophrenia. Which I do not  (no disrespect whatsoever to anyone that does) but she should know that considering how much personal information I had and have been telling her the entirety of our weekly meetings."
CPTSD,fe9og5r,t1_fe9kwb7,1578939976.0,"Very relatable! Three years ago I moved back to my hometown area and I didn't tell my mother as I was very low contact with her (for very good legitimate reasons). To keep the story short, I thought I saw her at a walmart parking lot while trying to find a spot, but I wasn't sure as it was raining pretty bad. So I did my best to shrug it off. Soon after got a job at a grocery store, I thought things were going well until some random people kept showing up and just starring at me- I thought I was being paranoid. I thought it was my anxiety. Soon after that, my mother showed up to my work with an evil smile on her face.

Well, it got to that point because my mother had managed to find where my sister in law lived. My mother showed up to her house, while my mother in law was there too, apparently she was in tears and inconsolable claiming that she didn't know where I was and whether or not I was alive or dead. And that she needed to see me.

So my sister in law told her where I worked. 

In my opinion crocodile tears work on those who've never seen the likes of manipulative people. For this reason, Im not upset at my sister in law. She had no clue she was being manipulated. It was during this time that I too felt that people thought I was crazy, or that I was just being nasty to my parent."
CPTSD,fe9k67z,t3_eo7j1h,1578938598.0,"I've had moments where I wished I had some concrete evidence, (like a recording) to show or prove to other people that what my parents had said to me really did happen. Because a lot (A LOT) of the things they did or said, when i've shared with other people gets dismissed. I think it gets dismissed because other people have had normal upbringings, or because what my parents have done is so messed up that it's hard to believe."

I've talked to my friends and my therapist about it, but as of right now I feel like they're all tired of me. I feel like I'm just being ignored or avoided."
