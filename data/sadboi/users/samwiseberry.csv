vanderpumprules,epp4hom,t1_epiq18b,1559363611.0,"I remember learning in psychology that it's common for people to see a photo of themselves and dislike how they look while other people think they look fine or good. We like things that we are used to more than things we are not used to. The only time we see ourselves is when we look in the mirror, and that isn't how we actually look because it's a mirror image of ourselves. So when we see a photo of ourselves (or video) we often don't like it, as we are not used to seeing ourselves that way. Weird thing to think about!"
