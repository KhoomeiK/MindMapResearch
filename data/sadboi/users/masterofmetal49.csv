Disturbed,fpinsa1,t3_gd45v6,1588644786.0,MTV running commercials for Stupify and The Sickness album in 2000.  Gonna try to dig up the ad now.
fantasyfootball,fp3xkkr,t1_fp3jb9j,1588287685.0,"I agree that he could be good in the right system, but that argument could be said of ... literally anyone.  That might be the Pats’ logic.  Matt Cassel led the team to 11-5 so why not save $ at QB, go with the wildcard of Stidham, see what you have in a year."
fantasyfootball,fp28ivi,t1_fp21b9u,1588257247.0,"The Pats are going with Stidham.  Even if they signed Dalton does that really scare anyone?   As a Pats fan I don’t see Dalton as a fit, it doesn’t really move the team forward."
depression,foxb0dg,t1_fouqjay,1588138694.0,"Good advice, I’m having more fun watching my friend play through Breath of the Wild than I would by playing on my own."
Fantasy_Football,foxan9t,t3_g9s57j,1588138405.0,"He’s getting a reputation for being a gadget player in the fantasy community.  The range of outcomes is literally from Tyreek Hill to Tavon Austin.  

Most players with Deebo’s current reputation are inconsistent week to week, so I see why many shy away.  

If you think he sheds that rep this year it’s a great upside pick, but it will require the 49ers to also see him as their top option in the playbook."
BreakingBenjamin,fox9sbc,t3_g9yus9,1588137730.0,"In all seriousness, what are we “supposed to be” listening to according to “them”?"
systemofadown,fom2sb0,t3_g803qj,1587876742.0,Same!  Found it in the checkout line at Best Buy of all places.
fantasybaseball,focfvfy,t1_foc4equ,1587670843.0,"Would love to hear more!  

I’m seeing a guy who’s posted low BB/9 and HR/9 rates in the minors.  Plenty of strikeouts, and he goes deep into games (QS potential).  I haven’t found a whole lot of guys who can check all of those boxes at age 23.  So that makes me optimistic for his quick development.

Plus, he has a full arsenal of pitches to keep hitters guessing in a pitchers’ park (maybe).  Let me know the anti-argument!"
fantasybaseball,foc3spn,t3_g6lxl6,1587666786.0,"Andrew Heaney, Sean Manaea, Mike Foltyniewicz, and best sleeper of all, Jordan Yamamoto"

running,fkpszgu,t3_fjr4mc,1584418522.0,Train up slowly.  I didn’t and ended up with runner’s knee.  Look it up.

fantasyfootball,f8w6apm,t1_f8vni33,1574884160.0,And a non-zero chance they switch to Minshew if it starts poorly.
seduction,exn2lgw,t1_exmmhuz,1566444789.0,"Someone needs to post a video of the same guy doing 2 approaches.  One when he cares, one when he does not.  Will anyone see differences?"
seduction,exmfkej,t1_exljmd7,1566430671.0,"Literally came here to say this, you’re not alone.  

Also if this mindset were true, how come when i was in a committed relationship and truly “stopped trying” i saw no difference in how women treated me?"
seduction,ewno82f,t1_ewnnz52,1565584341.0,"In short, same way i do with male friends.  Pretty easy going, i don’t change much.  I’d say i’m approachable and people feel comfortable with me.  Is that the issue right there?"
seduction,ewnnu6f,t1_ewnnoij,1565583971.0,Agreed.  Looking for ways to turn that bad vibe off by posting this.
seduction,ewnnpy9,t1_ewnn6f6,1565583857.0,"Wait, explain?  I kinda liked your comment, thinking life is completely fine without women is the attitude i need.  What’s incel?"
seduction,ewnnj6o,t1_ewnn14k,1565583676.0,"Have some great female friends, but they’re painful reminders that I’m nothing more than that to them.  

Need to forget because my life is completely consumed right now by this want to be desirable."
depression,ewfb22i,t3_cd0hjp,1565356358.0,And then having the usual early birds grumble when you’re 5 minutes late after this kind of struggle.  Horrible.
depression,ewek0th,t1_ewejyhh,1565326540.0,"Thank you, I always say forgiveness is a core value of mine.  Gotta practice what i preach, right?"
BostonBruins,eql21iz,t3_bysn0u,1560135598.0,Wouldn’t Bortuzzo face hearings for that last shift violence if it weren’t the end of the game?  Why let him get away now?
BostonBruins,eqkure9,t3_byiq6i,1560131557.0,HIT!
