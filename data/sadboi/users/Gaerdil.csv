I don't now. And I also tried to make stuff extra showy for the camera. Also big is not better. I say this from experience.

rit,fl0hcax,t1_fkufoaq,1584706437.0,"So my advisor said:

You have until the last day of classes to select the Pass/Fail option (it requires paperwork).  You have until you are certified to elect to add the grades back into your GPA.  Certification typically occurs 1-2 weeks after final grades have been posted so you would be able to see what your grade was.  I’ve copied the language they used below.  Let me know if you have any questions.

 
7. A student may request that the Satisfactory/Pass/No Pass option be changed back to a regular letter grade, which will then be calculated in the semester and cumulative GPA. Such a request will be honored if made before the student degree is certified. Should an instance occur in which the importance of a traditional grade is not known until after degree certification, the University will have an appeal process in place by which students can request that special attention be paid to their request for grade reversal. This request will be managed by the Office of the Registrar and in consultation with the Department Chair/Leadership and the Office of the Provost.

So it sounds like it includes finals."
