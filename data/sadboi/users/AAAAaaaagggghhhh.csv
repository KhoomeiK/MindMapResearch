personalfinance,fq4tyx3,t3_gguhi4,1589084117.0,"Definitely not too late!  Look for a community college, to begin with. They usually offer more student support and lower tuition. Online courses can also lower your cost. 

Speak with an advisor and make sure that your plan for the first two years will meet requirements for an associate degree. This does a few things: should anything happen where you don't finish your undergraduate, you still have that. It also helps to get you in the door for entry level positions that are closer to approximating what you want to do. Look for an employer that will fund the rest of your education. 

Other ways that students dodge the tuition trap: 
Some colleges don't charge tuition- google is your friend!  States in the US vary widely in how well they support their state schools. Tuition could be over 30K/yr in one state, and under 5K in another. You will need to establish residency in the state, and it may be worth it. Apply for financial aid. Nothing to lose, find out what it would cost.  Finally, consider Canada or Europe. We are losing great numbers of students who go to other countries because they often get: lower or no tuition, healthcare benefits, and even a stipend.  This would allow you to actually study, and know your field much better than if you are frantically working and going to school. It also allows you to take advantage of opportunities that come along instead of being too busy."

About height, talk to a doctor who specializes in growth hormone to find out if/when that may be a choice for you.  If it turns out that it isn't an option for you and you don't spring up later, look to other successful people (e.g. Robert Reich, Danny DeVito, etc.).  Less height is a daily inconvenience, so consider treatment if you are told that you are a candidate. I'm not an MD so IDK.  If not, remember that it's only a barrier to success if you make it so.
