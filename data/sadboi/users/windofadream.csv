aww,fqyddli,t1_fqwy5cw,1589746771.0,"__I have 2 adopted dogs. Next dog I get will be a well bred purebred dog. I’ve been through hell and back with the behavioral issues. I LOVE my dogs, but I’m not adopting next. All owners of adult shelter dogs should expect to be investing a good couple hundred dollars into a good trainer. 

__There are 2 types of breeders. “Family breeders” or “backyard breeders” - are in breeding for the money. Irresponsible dog owners who don’t spay/neuter (emphasis on irresponsible, I believe males and females should be at least 2 before alteration) or can’t watch their bitches in heat or let their dogs roam fall into this category as well. They want to make money off the sale of the puppies. A reputable breeder has health tested their females and requires the same of the studs. A good breeder provides a health guarantee, and also *will take the puppy back at any age* so that a dog from them does not end up in a shelter. A good breeder does not make much, if any, of a profit off breeding - they are in it for bettering the breed. They also spend time doing dog sports or showing the parents in confirmation. 

This is the exact problem with supporting the first group of breeders. They are more likely to produce unstable dogs, the family of the new puppy doesn’t realize the extent of the behavioral problem until the dog is older, and off to the shelter the dog goes. And the unfortunate reality is, not every dog will get a home. There will always be dogs who are too dangerous to adopt out (this is an issue I have with no-kill shelters, but won’t get into that). 

Breeding and genetics is complicated - and stupid people think they can just breed whatever dog, and make money. That shit pisses me right off."
aww,fqwx8tb,t1_fqwwhuj,1589720339.0,"Here's the thing though - if more people did their research, and bought their dogs from reputable breeders, there would be LESS dogs in shelters. Why? Because the more research and prep done before bringing the puppy home, the more likely it is that the family will keep the puppy. The problem is bad breeders who are only looking to make money, who sell their dogs for like $500 - a family gets the puppy for their kid (or whatever), and then realizes it's too much work. So before a year old, they send the dog off to a shelter ""for a better life"". I'm all for people spending $1,500-$2,000 on a well-bred puppy and KEEPING IT, because they were prepared. That's one way to help keep dogs in homes"

ankylosingspondylitis,fnnn1lf,t1_fnnl1se,1587096289.0,"I think it may be helpful to observe and document your pain level, symptoms, how long the pain lasts, when it starts/ends, and what makes it feel better. 

Mechanical or injury related pain may have a cause or event. The pain might feel better with rest. 

Pain from inflammation (AS) for most people is worse waking up (or in the early hours of the morning) and feels better with movement and exercise. 

Have you tried taking Ibuprofen? Does it help? Maybe also look up ways to support your back/body with pillows (cheaper than the new bed frame). 

My advice would be to document for a week or two, through phone app or journal - then show your mom how your pain is affecting you.

As it's been explained to me by multiple psychiatrists, the benefits to my daily life outweigh the risks or side effects. I do not have an addictive personality, and I've never needed to increase the dose of Klonopin. Benzos should be treated with respect, as they're pretty strong medications.   


Did your doctor tell you to take the 20mg Bromazepam daily? Or as you need it? Also, did you start all these medications at the same time? My first thought is about mixing a stimulant (Ritalin) with a sedative (Bromazepam) on a daily basis, and perhaps you may want to ask your doctor for more information about why they prescribed it this way for you - especially if you think your ADHD affects your daily life more than the mild anxiety.

To make a suggestion - as someone who normally loves tracking and making lists on paper - I started using the app Pain Scale (seriously, this will read like an ad but I promise it is not)  and I really like that not only can I rate my pain, but I can mark the areas of the body with each pain rating separately, and also make multiple entries each day. THEN, I can send an analysis to my email, and I can see how various things could affect my pain on a comparison chart (temperate, humidity, pressure, sleep, activity level).

Buffalo,fcqp3wc,t3_eifuha,1577889884.0,"I’m originally from Buffalo, and lived in Portland for a few years; I moved back to Buffalo late 2017. 

Art: The most well known Gallery (Albright Knox)  is closed for major renovation until 2022. Across the street is the Burchfield Penny Art Center. 

There are definitely pockets of art communities, the area you would want to be in is likely within the city. Two major art festivals in the city include the Allen Street Art Festival (early June)  and the Elmwood Art Festival (Late August). I think what’s great about these festivals compared to something like the N Mississippi Street Festival is that the vendors are unique - whereas, at least in my experience, many of the vendors at the N Mississippi art fest could be found at the Saturday market. 

There’s a “1st Friday” art and performance walk put on by the Allentown Association. 

A friend of mine runs the Western New York Book Arts Center - focused on printing and book-related arts. They are very involved in the community. 

I’m *sure* there’s more I am missing. 

Music: Buffalo has had some smaller venues come and go over the last few years. More well known bands will come to Keybank Center or Town Ballroom. I’m seeing a band called Pup at Babeville. A lesser known band might play at Mohawk Place. There are concerts along the waterfront in the summer. 
Compared to Portland... I feel there are more bands that pass through Portland. BUT - if a band isn’t coming to Buffalo, they might be coming to Toronto (2hr drive) Rochester (1hr drive) Cleveland (3hr) Pittsburg (4hr). So I really think there’s enough options to find what you’re looking for!

Other notes...

I did love Portland’s street cars and Max lines. Buffalo does not have great public transportation, and I think that’s something to keep in mind getting around. 

Otherwise, Buffalo is like what Portland once was. It’s MUCH more affordable (though your job choice should be taken into consideration). The city is more diverse. It’s less crowded. There’s also really a true magic about the spirt of the city and Buffalo’s renascence over the last several years, that I feel wasn’t found in Portland. The history of Buffalo is really interesting. 

Also, the food is better.   :-D

I just got in my DNA results, and found out that I have a genetic factor that affects my absorption of SSRI’s, that actually less of the drug could be making it to my bloodstream. So it makes sense that the higher dose works for me, and it made me feel better about being on the higher dose!"

I had a house sitting booked. The first night, our dogs were left in their crates for 12 hours, the sitter stopped by for literally 10 minutes, and lied to me about why they left the house- they left our dogs for another 3 hours until I was trying to contact them almost frantically about where the hell they were. I was able to contact a family friend to let our dogs out. Additionally, I have a Nest thermostat and noticed the heat was off and the house was 56 degrees F - I was perplexed why they didn’t message me to see how to turn on the heat! I did it from my app as soon as I noticed, but it was still a little odd to me. I want sitters to be comfortable in our house!!"
RoverPetSitting,f9k9nq6,t3_e5f6fy,1575395835.0,"If you check my post history, I had a similar thing happen to me!  Thankfully my dogs are older, but it definitely sucked. I follow this sub and see how considerate sitters are - there was a post asking about keeping the house tidy after a house sitting... and I’m over here like “where can I find these people in my city!!” So I think you’re absolutely right about a good vetting at the meet and greet"
femalefashionadvice,f8btxc7,t1_f8bfof2,1574445242.0,"To your last point, yes, Microfibers shed. But microfibers are used on Polyester because the filament can be made to be less than one denier. Because of the small size, a microfiber takes up more surface area. A larger surface area equates to more room for moisture to move throughout the fabric, or wick. Microfibers carry a “capillary like” action, which is why they are popular in workout wear. Sure, the material could be not breathable, but that’s due to bad fabric development, not the microfiber..."
femalefashionadvice,f7n34sh,t1_f7m9b21,1573882447.0,"It takes many brands months to go from concept to store. Currently, many brand development calendars run at least a year in advance. Nike, unless it’s changed in the last couple years, developed 2 years in advance. it takes meetings about the concept, rounds of fabric approvals, a few rounds of fit and proto samples (so comments back and forth, and time to ship samples) quality testing, sending the approved Spec to the factory. Then, the factory needs to negotiate and book out the order for production, and the order needs time to travel by boat and clear customs.  And! Brands sourcing in China need to plan ahead for SPSU because during  Chinese New Year factories are closed for like a month. 

Clothes definitely take time to make....

It’s the chemical auxiliary that is used to coat the fabric - brands like Nike and Patagonia phased out the longer carbon chain C8 chemical in 2015, many larger brands have also moved to C6 chemistry or below in years since to present. But smaller companies may not have phased it out.

The same freaking thing happens to me and I’m going through it right now. Dry mouth. My eyes hurt in the morning. And my jaw has been killing me. 

My pharmacy informed me 2 months ago they are not allowing people to reserve a particular generic anymore :-(. 

I was doing well on Accord brand. I didn’t have these side effects. I’ve been taking Teva brand for about a week and noticed the side effects a few days ago. 

This has happened to me before when I was on Celexa, so I know different generic brands affect me"
lexapro,f5wfizv,t1_f5v8oot,1572522757.0,"Of course depends on your own body chemistry, but absolutely you can wean off. You can go back down to .25mg and see how you respond. Your doctor can provide a schedule I’m sure - for me, I just decreased the days taken, was it was fine!"
lexapro,f5v6f8v,t3_dolqdy,1572484350.0,"I took Citalopram from 2010-2017. Highest does was 60mg, lowest was 20mg and I’d fluctuate does over that time. Switched to Lexapro in Sept. 2017 and have been taking 30mg since. I’ve been prescribed Klonopin since 2010. Approaching 10 years. Currently I’m prescribed .5mg. I take it maybe 2x per week. At the worst, I took 1mg nearly every day for weeks on end. I’m not someone with an addictive personality, and never felt the need to take more than prescribed on a single dose. 

However, if one would classify themselves as knowing they have an addictive personality (speaking from experience here NOT about true addition) I might caution to speak in detail with a doctor. Klonopin is known to be addictive, and especially at higher doses taken for only a few-several months at a time, withdrawal is reported to be absolutely horrible. 

TL;DR: I’ve been taking both for 10 years without a problem thus far."
AskReddit,f4mftvk,t1_f4l0nty,1571677826.0,I’ve solo traveled (as a women) in Asia and had people tell me how *brave* I was - I felt more safe there over placed I’ve traveled in the US!!! As long as you stay aware of your surroundings and do your research; make sure you’re truly not traveling to a dangerous country - SOO many countries are completely safe to travel to solo. It’s so worth the experience. Don’t listen to people warning you about all this malarkey unless they have really traveled there themselves and have experience with these dangers.
RoverPetSitting,f48tyyn,t1_f48s4c7,1571448835.0,"Overall it was better than what happened yesterday - they had their needs met. but I opened the app and checked in on the dogs, I noticed from the outside camera when she left, and saw the dogs were not in their crates. Which I have clearly told her and have written down that they are to be crated when no one is home. When I listened in, I could hear my one dog barking (it’s his bark when he gets stuck behind a door, I knew it right away. Old doors and wind. ). I listened a few more minutes and then heard my other dog crying and scratching at the bedroom door. The reason she needs to be crated is because the last time this happened she bloodied herself. So I called, she didn’t pick up. I texted and explained I needed her to get back ASAP. She was able to get over about 20min later. 

It just seems so simple to me (???) like I tried my best to make this all very easy, I left 3 pages of notes  in detail of their care, everything I could think of!"
RoverPetSitting,f48s78j,t1_f48oaeb,1571447418.0,"Overall, yes. Although - I ask on my crate instructions that the dogs are crated when left alone. Always. And she left for over an hour, and when I happened to check in on the Nest cam, I saw they weren’t in their crates and the time she left. So my one dog who has separation anxiety when left in a room with the door closed was crying and scratching at the door. And the last time this happened she was bleeding all over, so it’s why I ask to crate. I called and explained in text she needed to get over ASAP. She was able to come back and let them out of the room. So that was not amusing and frustrating"

I very much appreciate your reassurance here!"

I called Rover again, and while I was on the phone with Rover CS, they wrote they were on their way to the house. 20min goes by... I ask for an ETA... no response...40min goes by and I let them know that, and they said ‘sorry a few min away’. At that point we had my friend let them out. They arrived as my friend was leaving. I could see from the cameras they did stay the night and took care of our pups needs in the AM. They left around 8am. It’s now 11:30. I’m going to check in with them soon - and see how today plays out. The only reason I’m a bit more chill is because we found family backups of things go south. I hope they pull it together, if it’s awful again today I’m contacting Rover again!"

dogs,f17zp7n,t3_d82qi4,1569250593.0,"I prefer strong leash skills, and reward based training. Don't get me wrong.   
But I own a dog who we adopted with extreme fear/flight response. I've worked with 3 trainers, one world-renowned, who all have said he is an exceptional case of fear. He's the sweetest guy with no trace of aggression or reactivity, he's just extremely flighty and nervous. That's also an extremely dangerous trait to have \[running off, getting hit by a car. Getting lost; he was found as a stray\] This dog does NOT care about food or toys when he feels scared. There's NO starting threshold to even try to work with once we walk out the front door. He wouldn't take a chicken heart in these moments. I hope you get the point.   


The way I trained him is based on a pressure and release method. He is also e-collar trained. His obedience is impeccable under distraction. He can heel off-leash past other dogs, bikes, humans, critters, etc. I use tons of praise and make sure my tone reflects how proud I am of him. This is our neighborhood walks and nearest park I'm talking about. My goal for him is to move through this fear: and he needs to stick to the training that he knows. And he needs to do so to stay safe and he needs to be provided direction when he's nervous. I also own a Sheltie who would sell my soul for any bit of food, and is a pleasure to clicker train.   


I use extreme discretion with the nervous guy in e-collar use and numbers, but he NEEDS to be able to function in the world beyond his comfort zone of our home and backyard. In addition, I only use high-quality collars; there is a massive difference. This is why I advocate for the correct tools for the dog. He's never been shut down with this training, he has THRIVED! It's not always perfect, but we continuously work on it. He also LOVES hiking off leash, and paired with a solid recall, he's able to do this.  


A note about my Sheltie - she is severely reactive to other dogs on leash - and a prong collar correction gets her way more wiled up. I tried LAT and CC for 4 YEARS prior to balanced training \[and don't get me started on timing of reward, I studied that.\] Ecollar correction with proper timing is what worked, along with trained socialization with other dogs, and then being able to move back into CC. Now, she's able to enjoy way more freedom of coming places with us. It's been a win-win."
