schoolpsychology,fma7aov,t3_fu0vgj,1585885672.0,"Hi, school psychologist in CA here! Most school psychs don’t “visit” sites as they are assigned to a site by their district. Depending on the district, there is little therapy. I do more drop-in or risk assessments if a student makes a threat to themselves or others. I spend a lot of time working with behaviors in the classroom, collect/analyze data and working towards my BCBA. I can’t speak on the doctoral programs but I highly recommend you shadow a school psychologist and follow them around for an hour to two to see what their job is like. It looks different from preschool to adult transition programs. 
*obviously, shadowing can be done once Covid-19 has cleared up."
