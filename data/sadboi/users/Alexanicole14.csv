Teachers,fdi5r64,t3_elec2n,1578436219.0,"I doubt myself too. I’m not a full-time teacher yet, but when I did my field studies I would have good days and bad days. Talking with someone would definitely help. Also if you make a mistake or feel like you need to work on something, don’t doubt yourself and grow from it and improve! I know it’s easier said than done but there was one instance where I didn’t do so well on an observation so I asked my supervisor and cooperating teacher for suggestions and then I took them and they both noticed I did so so so much better. I hope this helps!"
Teachers,fdetcj9,t1_fdd46j9,1578346183.0,Oh my gosh! That means a lot!! Thank you!
Teachers,fdd2oek,t1_fctjhgs,1578292351.0,"Oh my gosh I had to take the Praxis before my sophomore year and I passed the reading and writing section but not the math because it’s my worst subject! Luckily, my school created a new rule where as long as you have a certain GPA, you don’t need to take the Praxis anymore! I go to school in Wisconsin so I had to take the Wisconsin Foundations of Reading test and luckily I passed! Good luck!"
Teachers,fcsks4i,t3_ein02r,1577918592.0,"I’m also in college, I’m student teaching this semester. I think it honestly depends on whether you want to teach elementary or middle. Do you feel more comfortable with elementary or middle? Or do you maybe want to push yourself out of your comfort zone and teach whatever grade may be a challenge to you?"
ChildrenofDivorce,fc1v38r,t1_fc1buaj,1577330638.0,Nice to know I’m not alone :)
ChildrenofDivorce,fc1txug,t1_fc17fkv,1577329613.0,"Yeah, my mom definitely uses guilt on me, which is not okay. When I tell her that it doesn’t feel right, she’ll say that I don’t know anything and that she’s the parent so she knows better. I’m 21 years old and graduating college soon, so I think I know more by now. She uses the “I do so much for you and you don’t appreciate it” to make me feel guilty, which to me seems like emotional manipulation. Apparently to her, I don’t appreciate her because I’m not expressing her own feelings towards my dad. She has exclaimed multiple times how much she hates my dad too. Although my sister and I are adults, I don’t believe that a parent should say that in front of their kids. I believe that she should express these feelings herself but she uses me instead as a messenger and to pour her feelings on. The person that I’ve been talking to has been friends with her for a long time and has known her since high school (my mom is 53 now) and she agrees that she has seen that as well so I know what I see is valid."
ChildrenofDivorce,fc153vg,t1_fc12jh2,1577308514.0,"That’s crazy! I just read yours and our situations are so similar! I don’t think my mom realizes what she is doing and tends to put her emotions before my own. Simply just spending time with my dad is disrespectful towards her. I have tried telling her, but she’ll kind of just disregard it. She seems to have some toxic qualities (even when I try to talk to her about my insecurities/worries she’ll just say she’s tired of talking about it and won’t bother to help me feel better). In the meantime, I have been talking to one of my moms friends who is actually a therapist/social worker (who I am also close with) about the situation, being careful not to have her tell because my mom will get angry. I’d still like to have a relationship with my dad, even though he has done some bad things, but my mom makes me feel guilty and puts pressure on me about it. I’ve basically been sitting in my room crying the whole day. Also, I hope your situation works out too!"
AmItheAsshole,fb0wbl0,t1_fb0mnlu,1576429849.0,Yeah this was unexpected so I didn’t know it was happening :( it was a last minute thing they decided to do after getting home from the bars. Usually they go to the bars and just come home and go to bed
AmItheAsshole,fayw9k6,t1_fayt7p3,1576407969.0,That’s true. One time they did this on a Wednesday night (less people but still loud) and I had to teach the next morning at my field placement. This lasted until 1:30 when one of my other roommates told them to stop and she was literally like I don’t think they care
AmItheAsshole,fayua32,t1_fayu5tm,1576407015.0,"I live in a house off campus so I can’t do that. Even if I lived on campus, there’s really no way I could be put anywhere else, it would be impossible. But they stopped! I just feel bad"
depression,f6k2szz,t3_dpl4bu,1572904025.0,"I don't want to diagnose myself, but I have basically all the symptoms. I'm a senior in college and ever since the semester started,  I've had this pang of sadness in the back of my mind. I  have already been diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder and social anxiety. I always feel bad about myself and only look at the negatives, and I constantly compare myself to others. I have had trouble concentrating as well."
