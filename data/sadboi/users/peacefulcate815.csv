The first 3 times I tripped (acid that turned out to probably be something else, mushrooms, acid) were really hard to deal with, but once I figured out how to allow it to do its thing and stop trying to control every single thing, I have found psychedelics to be incredibly therapeutic and beautiful for me.

Omg the backpack thing sounds so anxiety provoking lol.... but I know you’re right. The struggle I have is that I’m a teacher, so if it’s causing me anxiety in class, I don’t know what to do to deal with it because I can’t in that moment, if that makes sense."
mentalhealth,f6fq90s,t1_f6fpkae,1572816953.0,"No worries, I totally understand where you’re coming from. I was also asking because my psychiatrist (again, brand new to me, I’ve only seen him once so far) started me on Naltrexone to help with my PTSD and OCD-like compulsions (he explained it but I didn’t quite follow). I guess the other reason I asked is because I thought my compulsions were mild but if I don’t act on them in those specific situations, I get massive anxiety. 

For example, if I’m putting stuff in my backpack, it always has to go in the same order, facing the same way, every single time. Someone tried helping me one time and they just put stuff in there and I had a meltdown and started sobbing and had to pour everything out and start over. Stupid shit like that."
