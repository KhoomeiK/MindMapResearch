RelationshipAdviceNow,fqnq1x9,t3_gju8hy,1589499311.0,"Holy crap, no, you did nothing wrong. Honestly, she should be apologizing to you and not the other way around. She is way escalating things considering *she* did not communicate effectively in this situation. If she felt bad and needed to talk to you earlier, she should have said that instead of agreeing and then getting pissed when you did what you agreed to. I’m not gonna lie, I would be incredibly upset with her if I was in your shoes. She is taking this too far and I wouldn’t put up with her telling me off until I cry right before my stressful shift as a FRONTLINE HEALTH WORKER IN THE MIDDLE OF A GLOBAL PANDEMIC!

To be honest, I thought he was a girl until I talked to him, and then I was surprised again when I found out that he was a jock type villager. I didn’t expect to like him as much as I did, but he really grew on me. I had a lot of fun exchanging presents through mail, learning about his workout routines, and serving him his favorite coffee- blue mountain, ham on the milk, and 3 spoonfuls of sugar. Our taste is pretty similar in that regard, haha! He’s a gem and I’d love to have him again, but at least with something like this you know that whoever ultimately gets him really wants him and will take care of him."
