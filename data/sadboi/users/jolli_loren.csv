For example I was gonna say,
“Due to their busy schedules they were unable to do the parts from the organizer and we had trouble meeting up as well. However, I was the one who put all the information and did the research, constructed the trifold, and I printed the majority of what is on our project. All they did was print some images, and stick paper on a chopstick as seen above.” (it was a flag)"

teenagers,fmrmq7u,t3_fx052y,1586328072.0,"So here’s the story:

So we had this huge history project that counted for about 20% of our grade. At the time, I had some personal issues with stuff I will not disclose, but I decided to do what I thought what was best for me, which was to work in a group.

I grouped with these two girls, we’ll call them “A” and “B”. They were the ones who initially asked me to be in their group. It started out fine, but then the project required certain parts to be done. There were 5 parts total, and some other assignments that were connected to it as well.

I did Part 1 as well as all of the secondary assignments. As a group they said that they were going to finish the rest. “A” was supposed to do parts 2 & 3, and “B” was supposed to do parts “4” and “5”. Needless to say, they didn’t. They kept on giving me excuses like, “Oh, I’ll do it today”, “I’ll do it after school”, “I’ll do it on the weekend”.

The end of the first semester came and they didn’t do their part. They dragged down my grade to a B+ with the zeroes from those assignments. After winter break I was hoping that they would do something or feel guilty, but they ended up wasting that time as well.  

Second semester started, and the project was to be due in March. When we met again, they were telling me, “Oh, WE really need to finish the parts”. At first I was kinda offended, but I remained calm and was patient with them. 

Days, weeks, and months passed until it was 2 weeks before our project was due. Guess what? They STILL haven’t finished their parts. At this point, my patience was already over and I became really mad with them. When they would say “We need to do it” I would respond back “Yeah YOU need to do your part”. 

“A” showed some promise where she actually did something, but she didn’t do it all the way through. “B” didn’t do anything. They kept on asking me how to do their part, and what to do, and I tried, but they could’ve asked the teacher for help. Cause I felt as if they just wanted to know what to put instead of putting actual thought into it. Now don’t get me wrong, the parts were hard and time consuming on each one. But seriously, y’all had months to do it. 

A week before the project was due, I stopped talking or interacting with them. I was already done with them and I needed to focus the rest of the time finishing their parts that could’ve been done MONTHS beforehand as well as constructing and making the actual trifold/presentation.

Then “A” wanted to meet up and to make the project. I honestly didn’t want to meet up, cause the fact was I needed as much time to finish their parts as well as to make the project itself. She even wanted to purchase the materials as well. I didn’t let her though, considering that she didn’t know what to put onto the project let alone the information.

I then continued to not talk to them, and I ignored their text messages. All of a sudden, they got mad at me. They were saying how I was ignoring them (which I was) and that I wasn’t letting them help me. I then proceeded to call them out on every single thing. I already snapped at that point.

Of course, they felt bad and all and were apologizing. In order to make it up, they wanted to meet up to work on the project together. I said yes, so that just in case they would throw me under the bus I would have evidence that I tried to work with them and all.

From there I wasn’t even finished with their parts. When we met up, it was honestly a waste of time. I brought the materials and all, and they constantly asked me what to do. I was just trying to focus and finish everything. I kept them busy, but then I brought up the material costs and everything. It totaled to about $70, and I told them to pay me back. 

“B” asked me if I was to pay anything. I of course said, no! I told them that that’s the least they could do considering they had no contribution in the project other than printing paper. (I told them to print pictures). They proceeded to get mad at me and the rest of the the day went by and it was a day wasted.

The Sunday the project was due I was rushing the whole day to finish everything and I was stressing so much about it. I spent that day stressed, crying, and working on that one project where I depended to much on the hope that they would do something. 

The Monday the project was due, I was up all night still working on their parts-yes I know it seems I was working on their parts the whole time, but I did 6 months of research in a span of 3 days- and the trifold itself wasn’t done. My mom saw me and helped me out hella. She was mad af at me, but still helped me. I swear she did more in 2 hours than “A” and “B” did in 6 months. 

The day of our presentation came and I wasn’t even talking to them. I kept avoiding them the days prior and on the group chat they were stressing about what to say and all. So “we” presented to our teacher and to another judge. It ended up just me talking about everything while they just stood there and looked pretty.  

At the end, we received our grade and they were so happy. I was just relieved that I got a good grade. However it didn’t end there. Apparently “A” wanted to clear the air, and she tried but I ended it with, “As long as you guys pay me, everything will be fine”.

I was sick the week after the project, so they had the chance to not pay me then, but when I came back they gave me the same excuses as they did before. They didn’t even pick up the project either! Needless to say, the moral of this is:

Don’t work with people you know won’t do shit. 

I was ranting about this to my mom too and she said she would email the teacher about it. But I told her it wasn’t worth it. My teacher didn’t do shit about it either. I kept on asking him too if i could split away from them, but of course he didn’t let me. 

As an after story, karma got to them. “A” got caught cheating on an exam. “B” lost her airpods. So I mean I’m fine now. Still kinda bitter. But I’m better off without them. We don’t talk anymore. I know they’re gossiping about me too, but hey if they test me I can throw them under the bus way more. 

If y’all want more details, you can ask. But I’ll keep their names anonymous for privacy reasons."
