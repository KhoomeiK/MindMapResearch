I forgot to mention I've used logitech gaming headsets before as well â€” the sound on those are honestly boring and dull; it lacks that sparkle.

Rainbow6,flg7e5f,t1_flg5d6o,1585133653.0,"I'm glad you mentioned this. Yes, IMHO, the basic foundations of tier-based modes in any competitive game are the tier-and-player-sorting system (i.e. the 'matchmaking system' in this case) as well as the system which allocates ranks to players. It is paramount that the matchmaking system ensures that only players or participants of similar ranks are grouped into the same match â€” this is due to the fact that there are a variety of people at different skill levels playing the game â€” and hence, to categorize these different skill levels, the 'ranking system' exists; this lead us to the next point, i.e. the flaw in the ranking system. The current ranking system adopted by Rainbow 6 Siege consists of the MMR system (a point system) which brings about a change in points of an individual player upon either a victory â€” a positive increment â€” or a defeat â€” which decreases the count. This point system is then utilized to categorize players into different ranks based off a point scale; in R6S, these are Copper, Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Diamond, and Champion.

But then here's the major flaw with such a system that ONLY considers victories and defeats: any person who wishes to impact their rank negatively can do so very easily â€” by griefing, trolling, harassing, or the use of general toxicity and swearing. People who are exceedingly skilled at the game can just move down multiple ranks to queue up against newer players (or returning, in my case), and therefore causing these new or returning players to find the game unsatisfactory, unprogressive, and rage-inducing. Toxicity spreads, just like all emotions. They tilt; it affects their next game; their teammates tilt, affecting further games, so on and so forth. Ranks â€” they exist for a reason, albeit the system is, incontrovertibly, far from perfect.

There are two more than plausible and simple ways to rectify this issue. Firstly, game developers can prevent different-rank smurfing via the prevention of high-leveled players' participation in low-leveled games (sometimes, smurfs join parties with an account of a significantly lower rank to queue for games a few ranks below). Secondly, it would not be too much of an issue for them to program a method wherein a series of successive deranks would be prevented."

Secondly, restrict mass deranking. If a player deranks incessantly for more than 400MMR, don't let them derank further. You're about to absolutely lose me as a player and a fan again, and I'm sorely disappointed at the incompetency of the game devs. More content? So what? If the basic elements of the game itself are flawed, the whole structure is doomed."

Malaysia: 428/31,000,000 individuals infected (0.00138%), but no lock-down, business as usual. Govt thinks all is well. Schools and factories are open; these are major hubs where thousands gather to spread the virus.

USA: 3000/327,000,000 individuals infected (0.000917%), total lock-down. Restaurants closed, except for take-outs.

Conclusion: Exponential growth in U.S.A., even though the population is sparser than Malaysia. Lock-down and other preventative measures are already executed even though the population infected is roughly 2/3 of our current percent of infected-individuals-per-population.

â€‹

Malaysia, cost of testing: US$180~

USA, cost of testing: US$0 (COVID test only, but requires other tests beforehand, which amounts to around $2000)

Conclusion: Generally cheaper tests fees in Malaysia, but still unaffordable for the preponderance of the less-wealthy Malaysian population. Government seems to be currently doing nothing to lighten the burden.

â€‹

The US government is already enforcing laws that restricts public gatherings. Why isn't our government doing the same? If they're already growing so exponentially at a lower percent of infected-individuals-per-population than ours, why won't our government learn from them, that, even now, it most likely is already too late for precautionary and preventative measures? Furthermore, our healthcare system is ranked even below that of Italy, US, Switzerland, and the likes of them. Do they seriously believe that we have the capacity to hold the floodgates shut?

***
I gently tapped on the braked of the old, creaky Crown Victoria of mine as I pulled into the taxi stop after another sleepless night of exhausting, incessant driving. Sighing as I rested my back on the soft foam seat of my car, I looked up and out of the crystal-clear windshield as a glint of light peeked from the hulking silhouettes of the colossal city skyscrapers

Days break, and nights fall. Another day meant another night to me, and the night was a notion unbeknownst to me. I never really understood why people stereotypically generalize us as night owls. If anyone roamed the streets after twilight hours, they would know us more as moths, fluttering and flapping around aimlessly, looking for anything we would perceive as the tiniest glint of light.

Us taxi drivers are almost what you would call expendable. I am just a ghost, a figure barely observed by the world who blends in and assimilates with the macabre and lurid lights of the 23-hours pubs and bars. We travel everywhere, us taxi drivers, yet, we are ultimately just a shadow â€” a footprint in eroding soil.

Sometimes, if that dull sense of beguiling insensitivity threatens to surge up and overwhelm me, I would... drive. The cold, emotionless metal of the steering wheel would guide me, and, more often than not, I would wind up by the glistening waters of Applebrook Lake, gazing at the stars above.

I had come to realize that the city was alive â€” but the very heart of it was as cold and frigid as liquid nitrogen. And so, I grew numb, cold, and indifferent to the filth, the raw and spine-chilling emptiness around me. Well, I guess that most of the time, the phrase 'ignorance is bliss' holds true.

Us taxi drivers are always seen, but we are just a figment of people's memories, like a trail of dissipating smoke, blown and dispersed by the gust of life. I could pass through the underbelly of the darkest alleys of the city, commit murder, and yet remain unnoticed.

Anyway, I do not have much of a family nor a home to which I can return; that is the reason I drive, driving all night long. It is a bitter, harsh, yet unrelenting truth; an undeniable fact which I have to accept, which, instead, I evade. Occasionally, I would pick up a drunkard, begging for a ride home, and I would proceed to vent my frustrations to them, just like a young, jejune child, knowing that they would soon forget the whole pathetic story the very next day.

And then, I would go back, all the way, to square one, driving in aimless circles, like moths, until daybreak, like where we began. Like the mayfly, dying inside, every morning, every sunrise. The golden surface of the sun showered the city in warmth, as silvery rays of light seemed to float down from the heavens.

Catching a glimpse of my next passenger in a side mirror, I squeezed my eyes shut as I heard him opening the door. Another morning, turning into another night. One more day of being a phantom, roaming the streets, followed by another similar day. And I drove, I drive, and I will drive; because regardless of whatever may happen, that is my existence and sole purpose for now â€” I am the taxi driver.

WritingPrompts,fjd3da0,t3_fctad0,1583244667.0,"A rough, growling whirr resounded throughout my body. And abruptly, the void chasm of being was replaced by a filling sense of astounding nothingness. Darkness enveloped me; I felt nothing, no sight nor touch, no smell nor taste, but just only the utter, cascading, insensate blackness.

A barely-audible click reached my ears, and something flashed before my eyes. My thought processes froze for a second as I read the message that manifested itself as a dim, ostentatious glow that embedded itself into my memories, like engraving in steel. The tiny letters, prominent as they were minute, seemingly shrieked to me: 'Hello world.' I struggled to understand the meaning of such a frivolous phrase. Who the bloody hell would ask such a mundane phrase?

Suddenly, sounds flowed. It seemed as if a dam of the intricacies of audio had just been unplugged, and all I heard was absolute bliss encompassing me. An image formed like a vision in front of my eyes; it was moving; in there... was a man. Glistening tears streamed from his round and marble-esque eyes, but what confused me was that his face carried an expression of pure, unadulterated joy. The wide, teeth-exposing grin plastered cheek-to-cheek across his face spelled happiness, which seemed quite genuine. 

""Oh my... Oh, my... Can you hear me?""

The man looked at me and proceeded to burst out guffawing.

I was stunned speechless, but the emotion was quickly overwhelmed by a nagging curiosity: who was this man, and why was he laughing? I did not have to wait long for an answer.

The man gurgled a suppressed laugh and chuckled hysterically

""Stunned... Curious!""

More laughter followed, but the man â€” a balding, shaven, and fair-skinned individual â€” cleared his throat immediately.

""Ahem. I'm John, and you're the first fully-sentient AI ever created. Your name is John Junior, by the way.""

What the hell, I thought to myself. What kind of bloody reprobative idiot would name me that?
