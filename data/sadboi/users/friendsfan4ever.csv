TrueOffMyChest,facnhyc,t1_faadgwj,1575943017.0,"I don't know how much you struggle with mental illness, but I do want to say that sometimes people have been struggling emotionally for so so long, that it becomes their comfort zone. Even things like depression. No one wants to be depressed. People who are depressed don't want to be. At the same time, sometimes they can feel an inner struggle between wanting to get better and not wanting to just stay put because of the fear of facing life once they are not depressed anymore. They don't know who they are without the depression, and they know that once they recover, they'll suddenly need to discover their purpose, find things to do, get stable jobs, have real responsibilities, etc, and it can be really scary for them.
I'm not saying that you're wrong, because yes, there are definitely people aren't trying to get better because of the attention or the excuses or whatever it is. But that's a huge minority and we can't actually be sure of the reason that's holding someone back from getting better.

TrueOffMyChest,f9mqccj,t3_e5u8ao,1575467754.0,"Hi! I am Jewish and we don't believe that Hell will happen if one doesn't believe in Judaism or serve G-d from the Jewish perspective. Obviously, we don't believe that is the right thing (there wouldn't be Judaism if we did) but we don't either believe in fear of any torture of the Hell kind of sort to be the right tactic to use since that's just not the way we do things. Judaism is not about threatening or doing things because you're afraid. So, obviously, we don't teach our kids that. Or at least, we're not supposed to.

So I can't really speak for other religions that do have those beliefs or believe in teaching the children that.
What I want to say is that belief is something that you will automatically pass on to your children just by the simple concept of nurture. (Obviously this part applies to all religions and beliefs.) This is unless your child is naturally a free thinker and starts questioning and wondering about things and decides to think a different way than the child was taught.

Passing on your beliefs applies to all situations, not just religion. If you believe a person is amazing and inspiring and you talk about that person and why they're so amazing all the time, then you will pass that belief on to your children. That person being amazing and inspiring will naturally be instilled in them pretty much from osmosis. If something occurs in the child's life that challenges what he or she believes about this person, then the child will likely wonder and think about it.

The same goes for religion. If parents believe so strongly in their G-d and religion, they will end up talking about it a lot in general, AND when situations come up. At times they'll be talking about needing to have faith or about something great that happened and give thanks to G-d.

Again, to reiterate, of course if someone is more of a free thinker, they might go in their direction. But that is not the natural way things happen and the proof is that if you look around (you need to obviously know many religious people), you will see that although there are so many people out there who choose a different spiritual path than their parents, there are way more who stay on the same path as their parents WILLINGLY. There are many, many stories, and Ted talks, and tons of different ways you can hear first hand from people who chose to ""stray"", but it's the stories of those who chose to stay that you don't hear. (Side point: Probably because it's so natural and we don't even feel the need to question and think and choose which path we'll take, we don't feel like we have any stories to share.

I am open to you questioning what I wrote and even disagreeing. It's always okay to agree to disagree at the end of the day. :)

Another thing that makes me so upset about him leaving and going back to his way is that besides for him letting down Peter, he left everyone - without saying goodbye, and he seemed to really care about some of them. Peter, Mozzie, Elizabeth... Like does he care about them? Or not? He has to make up his mind. If he cares as much as he always showed or expressed he does, than why'd he want to pain them by not saying goodbye or by leaving them?

The laws are strict and once a person becomes Jewish, there is no going back. Even if a person thinks and/or claims to not be Jewish anymore, and maybe even ""converted"" to another religion, he is still 100% Jewish and still 100% responsible to keep the laws.

This is all besides for the fact that throughout history Jews have always been a target of hatred and will always be until the Messiah comes. There are stories every day of anti-Semitism. Being Jewish is not easy. It is actually really really hard. There is no Jew out there, no matter how saintly and righteous, who finds keeping the Jewish laws to be without difficulty. People who tell you otherwise are lying. If you convert to Judaism, you would be giving up everything in your life. Everything besides for your family, that's of course, if they will accept if you convert.

Of course, you are more than welcome to learn all you want about Judaism and the Torah, but to convert with a proper, orthodox conversion (the only conversion that you will be considered a Jew by all Jews), is a decision that is not a light one. So read up on Judaism! It's a great religion to be knowledgeable in! But really think about maybe not converting because it's an enormous and completely life altering action to take.

I actually thought of some crazy and philosophical question a few weeks ago, but can't remember it now"
TheBlackList,f9b3q8p,t1_f8u3rap,1575209005.0,Which one are you talking about?
TheBlackList,f9b3j7e,t1_f8tbxfg,1575208939.0,"Yeah, I've thought of that"

NoStupidQuestions,f9b31n8,t1_f8suqze,1575208789.0,"Haha do you live in New York City? ðŸ˜‚ Kidding, what you say could apply to anywhere in the world
It could be I am less desensitized to it because there aren't that many here, at the same time, my point wasn't that I believe people should give money to everyone. I guess just that even if we can't (or don't want to) give money to every homeless person we pass, I believe it's still important to remember their plight and I would say most of them are actually poor and are struggling with jobs or many other things. I guess I just feel it's what keeps me sensitized to it (and I like that I'm not desensitized). And no, I definitely don't give to everyone, although I wish I wouldn't feel a dent in my pocket if I would!"

I tend to binge... I'm sure I'll be done in closer to a week and a half lol if I'm not done even before that

But bingeing is annoying cus I love the characters and the show and I know I won't have it after I'm done..."
whitecollar,f93ak9k,t1_f93ai4z,1575054081.0,Kk thanks a lot :)
whitecollar,f939wbg,t1_f938qgg,1575053596.0,"Thanks.
I feel like asking you if it ruined everything for me, but that would basically be asking you to complete the spoiler lol
Grrrr I'm so frustrated."
whitecollar,f937arj,t1_f936o57,1575051704.0,"K listen. I know what happens. And I'm SO mad that I know. I know because when you Google almost anything about White Collar, what comes up are the words, ""Did Neal fake his own death""! Of course I never clicked on it but I was so so so upset when I saw that for the first time. I feel like it ruins the whole show for me. Even though it doesn't because that's literally the only spoiler I know throughout the show and that group of words is the only hint I have about that spoiler but I'm so so mad that I know to expect something crazy like that. I'm so mad I'm so mad I'm so mad. Words don't convey how annoyed I am. (Or maybe they do.)"
whitecollar,f92wv4c,t1_f92wr0g,1575043963.0,Yesssssss I was so sad. The relationship was becoming a real one
whitecollar,f92woq6,t1_f92wdrd,1575043826.0,"But in the end, I don't care because after all that he showed he's actually a selfish man."
