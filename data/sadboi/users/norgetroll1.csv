relationship_advice,fhwkmp0,t3_f4zrth,1581918895.0,"Don‚Äôt take his words personally. I am certain that he still loves and cares about you deeply, but his mental demons are clouding his mind. When someone is just starting their treatment and facing their issues, it could be tough and overwhelming. Try to understand and educate yourself more about this illness, the media generally portray the wrong image about bipolar. Also I think it‚Äôs quite common that untreated bipolar and take a toll on intimate personal relationships. (When I was undiagnosed I was constantly on a bad relationship streak with my family. Me and my family both can grasp what is going on) A really good support system (your husband‚Äôs family, you, and people close to him) are now critical to his recovery. Stress and mood in general should also be closely monitored. Also if he drinks coffee, try to ask him if he could temporarily stop the consumptions (limited any stimulants) 

I really wish you and your husband the best. Even though this stabilization will be like a growing pain, it would eventually bring a new and stronger couple out of it!

Edit: People with untreated bipolar tend to be really delusional. So I can see why he got into a sketchy religious circle. If anything, you also need to care about your mental wellness too! Things like this can be traumatic"
relationship_advice,fhwjspq,t3_eo6dmf,1581918081.0,"Please ask him to stop using pot as a stress reliever. If your husband got bipolar or schizophrenia, the number one rule is to limit alcohol or drugs (since it can trigger and further worsen paranoia and delusional thoughts). 
I‚Äôm not against drugs at all, however I have been diagnosed with Bipolar rapid cycling and I can confirm you that the way you describe your husband‚Äôs episode sounds like what I have been through. (Speaking differently, acting regularly in front of other people, and delusional thoughts etc)
My psychiatrist misdiagnosed me as schizophrenia for 5 years straight, and I wasn‚Äôt correctly treated. Plus at that time I was going through a huge trauma and had tons of stress on my shoulders. The fact is I know he will want to find some sort of temporary relief like pot (trust me, when you are at that stage all you want is to stop the pain you are going through), but that will just fuel the illness. 
The fact is your health also matters a lot, and I don‚Äôt blame you for wanting out. (I was a destructive tornado when I had extreme episodes) BUT PLEASE, he needs to be put on a medication that can stabilize everything. A bipolar (or schizophrenia) patient off medication is just as serious as a diabetic patient pretending monitoring blood sugar is not important at all. 

I wish OP and your husband all the best, and everything will get on track again"

Instead of paying attention to those that lost the mental illness battle, we need to solve the root problem of accessibility and negative stigmas.
