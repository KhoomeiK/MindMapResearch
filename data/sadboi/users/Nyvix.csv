haworthia,fjnimiy,t3_fedjet,1583508200.0,I did the same thing for my birthday. Perfect time of year to splurge on haws. 😉
succulents,fjhxsp2,t1_fjhxhno,1583357028.0,"Surprisingly this lady’s pots in front of her home has 100% soil in them and they grow like weeds. I don’t understand how, haha."
succulents,fjhwjxp,t1_fjhvsfr,1583356377.0,Well that’s good to know! I know in the past I’ve looked into growing a specific type of Magnolia tree and discovered it wouldn’t grow in my area of Florida because of the salty air. I figured desert plants would be even less tolerant.
modelmakers,fjgkzqk,t1_fjg32rk,1583329534.0,I appreciate that!
modelmakers,fjgky1g,t1_fjg3est,1583329499.0,Thank you! :)
StarWars,fjgkx2g,t1_fjfonxo,1583329479.0,Thanks a bunch!
modelmakers,fjgkvlv,t1_fjfsxfd,1583329449.0,"I used a cotton swab to “paint on” super glue gel first then added polyfil for hair. Once it dried I just kind of played with it with tweezers and scissors, cutting where needed until I was happy with the result. :)"
modelmakers,fjflf7e,t1_fjfjv1h,1583294243.0,"Yeah man I was the same way after watching Fwoosh’s build on this kit. At the end he was like “I’m just really not impressed with this one, it’s probably my least favorite”. I was determined to make it work, especially since Bandai makes so few Jedi kits. 

Good luck on that speeder, sounds like a fun one!"
modelmakers,fjfj67k,t1_fjfinc9,1583292872.0,"Inspiration— that’s the best compliment I could receive, thanks so much! The [1/12 Yoda ](https://i.imgur.com/S1z4wu0.jpg)was fun as well and served as a good practice run since the cloak material has the same texture mold between both models. The only difference is the 1/6 is half plastic and half rubber but they seem to take weathering exactly the same despite being different materials."
StarWars,fjf8d9z,t1_fjf863n,1583286462.0,Thank you. 🙂 Polyfil and super glue gel! The kit came with a [molded piece](https://i.imgur.com/x5xdQ65.jpg) but it looked terrible so I improvised.
