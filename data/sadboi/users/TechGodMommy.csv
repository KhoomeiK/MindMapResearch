oneplus,fqii2gm,t3_gir8fl,1589396280.0,Is this only happening with the pro model? I haven’t seen anything from the regular OnePlus 8 community post about it yet. But I could be because I missed it.
lonely,fqeucqc,t3_gi1g6t,1589313733.0,I’m 31F but I love talking to anybody so you can always message me. I don’t have a lot of friends either and I just like talking lol. So yea.

I can’t wait to see my best friend, I’m gonna be right outside her house like “WASSUP BITCH!!” Lol.  I don’t have a lot of friends but I have a lot of people I chill with tho.

Edit: However I will not be going out for awhile because I think it’s too early and I can’t afford to risk getting covid-19 as I don’t feel like dying anytime soon lol"

disability,fo9gimt,t1_fo9f7gn,1587618886.0,"But we have lost income to higher costs in transportation, buying supplies we normally wouldn’t need to buy and in cities (like the one I live in) sometimes having to go to 2 and 3 stores takes money away from things like food, meds, normal house hold goods since we are stuck at home we have to use MORE of our resources. That costs us, so we are losing income. Not to mention the price of Uber has been a lot higher in Baltimore. Uber to the hospital I go to was around $12-$15 now it’s $25 on the low end."
lonely,fo26ybx,t3_g58ytt,1587451695.0,Yea. But there will be others.
AnimalCrossing,fo24aht,t3_g53x4x,1587449279.0,I didn’t know about them even having fleas until yesterday when I was trying to catch a butterfly and accidentally smacked Tutu in the head as she was running by. She thanked me lol.
lonely,fo21ul5,t3_g58ytt,1587447215.0,If she was just using you to make herself feel good then it wasn’t that you didn’t have something she wanted or that your weren’t enough. It’s that her intentions were only based on her needs. It sucks but...🤷🏾‍♀️😔.

insaneparents,fk6b7ie,t3_fgi6w6,1583897696.0,"That's abuse. I homeschool my daughter and if she has a problem with something I reevaluate the way I'm explaining it to her. She's a child, hitting a child when they don't understand something diminishes their self esteem. Making them feel stupid and they aren't,  they just need so encouragement."

iPhone11ProMax,fa2hjeq,t3_e7fuu7,1575782172.0,I had Midnight Green but I needed the highest space capacity. Unfortunately my local Best Buy didn't have 512GB Midnight Green iPhone 11 Pro Max. I ended up being outside of my return date so I gave the Midnight Green 256GB to my mom. The only colors available were the Space Gray and Gold 512GB so I decided to go Gold and I'm loving it. My mom seems to love the Midnight Green.

iPhoneX,f8cypak,t3_e0a5rl,1574473143.0,Is uploading them to a computer or flash an option?  When I bought my first 64GB iPhone I knew never again. Now I only purchase their largest space variant. I use the cloud but even with the cloud it still leaves  some files on the phone .  Apple likes to be difficult sometimes with their space.

ATT,f8bvsu2,t3_e01t0w,1574446482.0,I’ve been getting calls like this. I do know people in other countries because I’ve lived outside of the US a few times but all my friends know then to call like that. It’s gotta be FB or WhatsApp. Sometimes I get calls that show as American numbers but when I pick up it’s a delay and then more then one voice always from a foreign country but it’s like they are talking to each other. I hang up and they call back. I block them. 🤷🏾‍♀️
