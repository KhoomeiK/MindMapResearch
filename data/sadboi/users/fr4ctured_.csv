I never bring enough then end up buying overpriced snacks on campus."
UofT,fqkh119,t3_gja5ip,1589427122.0,"I personally prefer online since it's at my own pace and I get distracted really easily irl so I hardly pay attention in lectures. The fact I have a condition that affects my energy/focus levels and my long commute probably factors into this, I'll admit. The major downside to online Imo is the social/networking aspect."
EDAnonymous,fps3t1o,t1_fmrayl9,1588866990.0,"thank you. it really is frustrating. i have no idea how to stop and it seems like it's a habit i can't break. feels like i solved my eating disorder by swapping it for another one, lol."
relationships,fps3jbb,t3_gespew,1588866859.0,"i can understand watching porn but spending money on it to the point where he prioritizes it over you and saying hes broke would definitely get me as well. can you get more info out of him, asking why he says he doesn't have money for you but still can sub to these women? im sorry you feel inadequate, i totally understand where youre coming from but these girls are selling a fantasy anyway, with posing/angles/makeup you could prob sell your own too lol. also i thought i was the only one who felt grossed out after finding out my partner watches porn -- as lame as it is, i just feel kind of like a side piece lol, but unfortunately i dont think theres much you can do abt that since many people will say its just being a controlling ass."

premedcanada,fai8798,t3_e9di9a,1576101880.0,"I've kind of just accepted it by now (if you mean excessive anxiety/obsession.) Then again, it's been a lot worse when I'm off meds. In a way, it seems too deeply entrenched in my personality to ever get rid of completely, so maybe you can make it work for you instead of try to fight against it"
Anxiety,f93gfl1,t3_e3awvk,1575058408.0,"I've always struggled with this concept too. Imagining other people seeing me as someone different than what I imagine myself to be -- useless, stupid,etc. It is a pretty surprising feeling. But it's nice, I hope it lasts for you."

Anxiety,f820att,t3_dyfwbm,1574181247.0,"Speaking as someone who was in a similarly low place before, I congratulate you on seeking the help you need. The first step is always the most difficult. Anxiety can rob us of our very own autonomy as we are overrun by irrational compulsive thoughts. Somehow it's comforting to know I wasn't the only one in such a place, though I do not wish that for anyone, it is good to see that you can recover even from the darkest place. Much luck to you and your future."
