YouShouldKnow,f8rs1ar,t3_e1nher,1574750633.0,"i have a rare kidney disease, Alports Syndrome, which is basically every time i pee, microscopic bits of my kidney go with it. this means urine tests happen frequently and they always talk about the amount of blood in there afterwards as a way of monitoring. around the same time, i was working at my first job (some chipotle style restaurant with healthy salads and juices) and we got a new beet lemonade - which was delicious and i drank it frequently during shifts. one night after work i must’ve drank enough bc i was awoken by my terrified mother who walked into the bathroom with red pee still in the toilet (it’s late, i’m tired, and the toilet is loud when it flushes so sometimes i leave it). she thought my kidneys were failing so we went straight downtown to the ER where the poor nurses had to deal with my hysterical mother. they got us a bed and had me go pee again while waiting for a doctor. the pee was lighter pink now so i started to doubt that is was actually bleeding internally, but the news didn’t really seem to calm my mom’s nerves. after what seemed forever the doctor came in and the very first thing he asked: “you have any beets lately?” my blood levels were fine and besides the ER bill, it was a pretty chill night, i even got some Wendy’s out of it!

tl;dr they don’t tell you about beets making your piss red even when you’re diagnosed with a kidney disease which can lead to late night ER visits with frantic mothers... stay frosty people"

I spent my days in bed, at my desk playing video games, going on multiple benders so I’d either forget about or sleep through classes I wasn’t prepared for etc.

My parents are incredibly loving and supportive, but I’m terrified for how they’re gonna take my news. I really just want to work this winter and save some money so I can get back out West and see this beautiful country before I am too old and boxed in... is that too much to ask??"
