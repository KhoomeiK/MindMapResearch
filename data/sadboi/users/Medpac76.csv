depression,fbvgo6e,t3_ee58qm,1577130535.0,I opened up to my co-worker and the conversation between us was great and she was saying all supporting things. I really thought she was my friend...that was until she thought I was in the bathroom. I went to go photocopy some paperwork and overheard her saying how annoying and overly sensitive I was. She invalidated my anxiety about work and depression to all of my other co-workers and everyone laughed. Even my boss laughed. I want to quit but I can‚Äôt. I can‚Äôt even cry because after they found out I heard them they keep sending people to check on me at lunch and I don‚Äôt wanna cry in front of them all.

polymerclay,er2343v,t3_c060is,1560439655.0,"Don‚Äôt use sculpey 1 from Walmart or the clay craft ones they have there. It is too soft and if you bake an item multiple times the whole thing cracks and goes soft and falls over. Sculpey is a great brand just use the sculpey 3 it is harder and easier to use (also cheap on amazon). If you want air dry clay then I suggest hearty clay. It is nice and it is soft when it dries only thing it can get a little pricey as well as it is NOT waterproof. Do not get air dry clay if it is gonna be exposed to water or if it is for food. 
Good luck and have fun experimenting with all the different kinds of clay!"
