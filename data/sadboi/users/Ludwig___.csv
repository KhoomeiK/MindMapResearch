summonerschool,fqwtlkk,t1_fqw4z7g,1589717180.0,Thanks! With Zac I almost always full-clear because I want to get range on my E. I try to punish overextended lanes and prioritize lanes near an objective. Also i gank a lane if I believe that the match-up is even or if the enemy scales hard and I want to shut him down. I do buy wards often. Why do you think I don't?

I usually invade only if I know where the enemy jungler is by actually seeing him on the map. I ended up maining Zac and I can't decide about other champions to play so I don't have a solid backup option. Regarding the objectives yes, I always try to convert kills into objectives or sneak them when I can do it safely but I have to rely on my team for early drakes with Zac. If for some reason my adc doesn't want to get the first two drakes(or can't) I can't do much about that.

summonerschool,fqve1il,t1_fqlbq1b,1589675288.0,Where did he say that a CS disadvantage means that the lane is lost? You just have to think if you can get a kill and what you can get out of that kill. If I'm against a 1/0 lv 6 Darius I won't take the risk of gifting him a double kill and dooming my poor top laner. And if I have a losing top match-up and an even bot match-up with herald down and drake up it seems stupid to me to not go for the bot gank if I can.

summonerschool,fo2k0j0,t3_g5bvmc,1587465340.0,"How do you forget to farm jungle camps? It's the most relaxing thing to do in the game :3

What made me escape Iron IV(kekw) and gave me a majestic 70% wr in Bronze IV(kekw) was playing scaling picks and balance everything around farm. Always have a plan. If you want to get a drake and you don't know where the enemy jungler is you know that you have to gank bot, rotate to take it and then farm your bot jungle. Try to have as little camps up as possible. And be sure to not take strange routes to reach your camps.

If you see the enemy jungler botside and you think that his topside camps are up(and you are topside of course) you can take them, but be sure that you don't get collapsed on if his jungle is warded for some reason. If there is a wave that is crashing under your tower you MUST take it! If your laners are ignoring sidewaves you MUST take them! Farming is the best way to stay relevant throughout the game. It doesn't matter if your champion is an early game one or a late game one. You should also consider that laners don't always react really fast to ganks so in terms of pure resources camps can be better than ganks. If you are 4 levels down the enemy laners you will likely be useless because soloQ isn't proplay."

1) Not araming and not taking useless fights. This advice gets spammed a lot here and maybe I misunderstood it but it's really terrible. You should play towards your teammates intentions. You should get what you can based on what your teammates do. Sure, collect that juicy sidewave undertower but if you feel that a fight might break mid be sure to be there asap, because your teammates will engage at a number disadvantage and tilt because you were not there.

2) Reading and watching a lot of guides but missing on some fundamentals. I had kind of a general idea of macro plays but I ganked from awkward spots expecting a perfect follow-up(never going to happen in Iron) and I didn't farm efficiently."
