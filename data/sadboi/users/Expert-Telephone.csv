heroin,foqa8cj,t1_fopzmqp,1587988221.0,I have naked lunch but found it hard to read. I gave my copy of junky to a friend but really want to re read it. I'm 3/4 through Cities of the Red night but I haven't picked it up in awhile. I liked that poem you posted
BPD,fnnme9q,t3_g2tm8s,1587095830.0,:( I hope you're okay
CompulsiveSkinPicking,fnjlcac,t3_g2530s,1587001389.0,I do this for hours a day. I'm too scared to look at my scalp it hurts so bad I feel like I've really hurt it  I don't know how to stop unless I'm busy doing something
BPD,fn9dh3c,t3_g0eogj,1586768708.0,Yes
BPD,fn97r8y,t1_fn975w3,1586762416.0,"I don't think I could hurt anyone. But I feel like these other people on here are saying they do feel bad about it but for some reason end up doing it anyway, I'm not them so I don't know but I think the people on here are just relating to behaviors they exhibit... Maybe not totally realizing the affects it has on people. I don't know. I do things without thinking about the consequences frequently and I don't often take people's feelings into account and then after realize I fucked up. I don't know... I know something is wrong and I do it anyway, it isn't good but for some reason I keep doing things I know suck, feel bad about it then do it again. I DONT KNOW. I'm just trying to say I don't think anyone on here was bragging or anything uhgg I'm tired I can't explain my thoughts"
BPD,fn975w3,t1_fn96ned,1586761803.0,?? Who doesn't feel empathy? I just assume I haven't hurt anyone because I'm garbage and it was all a trick anyway and anyone who is talking to me is talking to someone else anyway .. also I added to the last reply saying it is understandable to be pissed off about that
BPD,fn96lmy,t1_fn95y27,1586761235.0,I figured as much and that's totally understandable being pissed off about that

BPD,fn8sm1t,t1_fn8saxy,1586749187.0,"I am super manipulative. I'm really mean and abusive. I'm mad you idiots are shaming someone for trying to be honest about something shitty they and others do. I find it's really helpful and makes me feel less alone/scared to admit the shitty things I do to other people like my doctor and therapists. Don't try to silence and shame people. Everyone wants to do better, it's good to be able to admit and recognize what you're doing is wrong"

I think most people who are interested in that kind of thing were abused in that same way so they're kind of fucked up and they can't really control that."
cocaine,fn3fwxc,t3_fyzfzn,1586619921.0,This looks exactly like my friend's place the other night... What's with this weird beer

BPD,fmhvq4o,t3_fuytth,1586095019.0,Yeah. I feel pathetic and that I should be able to over come my feelings because other people are struggling worse but I just feel sorry for myself and I'm just a weak waste of life... I hate myself

interestingasfuck,flnwee5,t1_fljdan7,1585327150.0,People with babies will often have a bin full of pissy and shitty diapers....this idea isn't that crazy and it would save money and waste.... You could keep the used rags in something with a lid.. have you ever owned a cat? They're litters can smell like piss and shit but that's pretty acceptable. I'm surprised and confused at the closed mindedness of commenters :s

BPD,fg45dns,t3_ewn2fp,1580496507.0,"I haven't read all the comments but I am someone who threatens myself. I gave been diagnosed with bpd and my emotions suck . My boyfriend and I have been together on and off for eight years. He sets up strict boundaries and stands up for himself and tells me when I'm hurting him. If I start to threaten myself and have a meltdown he calls my family/ambulance immediately. He doesn't want to be manipulated and though I am manipulative when I'm freaking out over whatever paranoid delusion is going on in my head I ultimately don't want to manipulate him so he nods it in the bud, he is supportive of me but he doesn't put up with threats"
