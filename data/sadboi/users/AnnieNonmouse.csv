BoJackHorseman,fr1tose,t1_fqz069l,1589825770.0,The sound was excellent in those scenes. There was a melancholy piano chord I think? Like a very simple one. And there was this white noise or something when things were quite and then like you said the people yelling down at her. One of my favorite Diane episodes.
BoJackHorseman,fr1tfv2,t1_fqyarco,1589825649.0,It's funny I like that episode as much as I like every episode but it's not a stand out to me. I do have that voice and it was a really creative way to show that type of depressive thinking but I ended up liking another similar episode a lot better. Anyway point being I experienced with this episode what you experienced with Free Churro. Just thought that was interesting.
BoJackHorseman,fr1sszc,t1_fr0ulsb,1589825342.0,"Yeah that's not a contradiction it's more of an addition. You *can* still be the person you want to and it's never too late to do that as long as you're alive but saying you're a good person ""deep down"" is meaningless and not taking active steps to be the person you want to be."
breakingbad,fr1cf12,t1_fr0subj,1589817263.0,That is one of the only times I disliked her and honestly even then I do understand as she has no clue how important Jesse is to Walt (crazy that she was the one to say put the hit out and he was the one resisting) and that Jesse is the one being manipulated by Walt 99% of the time. She was married to Walt for more than a decade and suddenly Jesse is in his life and he's a meth manufacturing king pin lol. I guess from her side it would make sense she didn't care about Jesse and just wanted to protect her family.
breakingbad,fr1bub2,t1_fr0soyj,1589816974.0,This is a great point and I just want to add a small detail to your last paragraph. Walt had made a show of how much money he was earning and made sure to tell her many many times that he makes a lot of money in a short period of time. It's really reasonable that she assumed they would make it back no problem. She did it for a good reason and like you said all the characters in the show do things with consequences you could never reasonably predict.

stepparents,fqq26ka,t3_gk9y5o,1589558121.0,"I went through this. I'm more child free leaning for myself than I was in prior years but I love my boyfriend's kids. I got pregnant at 19 I knew I wasn't ready for a kid at all (financially or emotionally and the way I grew up I couldn't live with myself if I had in a kid in similar circumstances) I also knew my BF did not want more kids. It was a quick decision for me and I knew what I wanted before I even talked to my BF about it. He was on the same page and we got the abortion.

I *still* had those same hurt feelings. Even though I was sure. Even though I knew it was the right decision for me. Even though I would do it all over again if I had the choice. I felt devastated for all those same reason you listed. Like my BF didn't care about me since he didn't want kids with me, like I resented his kids and the attention he and his family gave them, like I was all alone in this surprise grief. I was so angry and I felt the same way like I had killed my ""child"" and that scared and surprised me (because I view it the same way your BF does) and I resented my boyfriend for that too. 

It really throws your body into a whirlwind of hormones. It does a number on you and you can never be sure if it will be easy but you're not alone in having these complicated feelings. Like I said I really don't want any of my own now but I still remember very clearly that turmoil I was in and how angry and sad I was."

I am working from home so I'm not judging anyone who is in dire straights and wants go work I just keep seeing it the other way and find it interesting.

At least Dan finally calls out Rachel in the end even if she cops out by saying she was ""corrupted"" by the city.

I was like ""Uh well I can't agree with you on that one I think your other friend was right to be upset with her...50,000 (at the time) people are dead.""

People are going out to eat. Very few people wearing masks or gloves at the Winn Dixie I went to and a mother came in sans protective equipment with her two little girls and let them literally run all over the grocery store like it was a playground (I'm not exaggerating they were pushing tiny carts and doing laps around the store and around certain aisles the entire time I was there). Ugh I needed to vent a little sorry."
CoronavirusUS,fpgiq09,t1_fpd7qyb,1588603500.0,"To me this sentiment isn't directed at people who are experiencing economic hardship. At least from my end, I'm not upset with those people, I'm upset with the people who are protesting because it ""impedes their freedom"" to be told to stay home and I'm upset with the people are are upset they can't be out at bars and restaurants because they just don't believe it's serious and they don't want to be told what to do. 

The people who need to work and have no money and the people who are in violent situations trapped with their abusers or who are suffering major mental health problems because of isolation - those are not who this is directed towards."
AskReddit,fozmfhq,t1_foyaaa6,1588193103.0,I think maybe he's saying we don't need to compete in the suffering Olympics. There are many studies showing that office workers (especially those with jobs that aren't really integral to society but service luxuries - ex. a paper company that buys paper and then sells it to you when you could go direct to the paper manufacturer) see a negative impact on their physical an mental health form their jobs. I worked retail and fucking hated it so I'm not saying retail and the inconsistency of it also doesn't impact your health negatively because I know form experience it does but it's not a competition.
AskReddit,fozlid7,t1_fowumhr,1588192664.0,"I agree to an extent. I work an 8-5 and prior I worked at a grocery store. I wouldn't trade KNOWING my schedule and having a consistent paycheck for working retail again. You're right that it's a huge privilege and one I don't take lightly since not many people without college degrees can get the kind of job I have where I live (not that it's anything special but it's a nice white collar job in a an office). 

Still after 6 years of working there I feel that it's not necessary for me to present 1/3rd of my life when the work can get done quicker, but we still have to be sitting at our desks for the hours required. That's the only thing I dislike about office life, the constant worrying about appearing to be busy and appearing to work when it shouldn't matter, I should be able to go home when it's slow and just be on call until 5, and I should be able to work form home a few days a week because there's no reason for me to be in the office except that they are more traditional. I've been working from home and I've seen a real improvement in my overall well being. 

That's a better problem to have than what I've had to live with before though, so I get your sentiment."

If you were being destructive (and it doesn't sound like you are in these situations)  then yeah he would not be wrong in helping you calm down and be mindful. If you just want to be alone while you're upset and then try to talk about what's bothering you calmly later he needs to respect that and let you. When you're not already fighting you should talk to him about it, and how you don't think it helps when he dismisses you like that.

All that is said hoping that this one comment doesn't encapsulate your entire relationship (which I'm hoping since you're engaged). However, if he won't discuss it with you and refuses to stop dismissing your feelings even after you guys have calmly discussed it (again not while you're arguing about something) then he's a jerk and yeah you should probably reconsider the engagement."

stepparents,fo2x9hz,t3_g55o1p,1587476235.0,"Yeah this used to piss me off so bad.

I also am honest with them if I don't think something I made was a hit, like ""well i tried to do this but it didn't work, next time I'll try x - what do you guys think??"" 

Seriously though the one thing I will NOT tolerate is being rude. I sat them down and told them a few times that it hurt my feelings because I worked hard to make that food, and that there are nicer ways we can disagree. They're 10 and 13 now and this system works really well for us (they even tell me I'm a good cook sometimes!).  Good on you for not putting up with the rude comments!

CoronavirusUS,fmpnzcw,t3_fwlcom,1586284222.0,"My boyfriend delivers pizzas for a local place and he says the same thing about the nice the neighborhood the less he gets tipped. Some people even have acted like they're doing him a favor when they give him $2.

I grew up pretty poor and have now clawed my way to a lower middle class and I can't ever imagine ordering food if I didn't have enough to tip the greater of $5 or 20%. It's unkind. If you can't afford that $5 I would usually suggest you cook a meal at home instead. Now though I guess patronizing the restaurant so the delivery person can at least get their crappy paycheck is better than nothing? I still agree with you it's crappy and I don't understand it.

EDIT: I gotta say I'm really disappointed in what seems to be the prevalent attitude in this thread. First off, ordering food for delivery is not budget friendly on it's own, like at all. I could stock up on food for the next week or two and my diverse meals will cost a fraction of what ti would cost to order food *before* tip. So for the people saying they're entitled to diverse meals for cheap because they have no money I truly don't understand - it's already not cheap. I have been in a situation multiple times where we were squatting and could barely afford to keep our water on much less have good food. I get it - it was awful. I have a lot of empathy for your situation. But the selfishness I'm seeing in this thread is so gross.

You don't think the people who are delivering (in the US for *below the minimum wage in many states*) have these problems as well? You think they don't deserve your $5? Come on. This is peak selfishness. I get you don't want it to be your problem and the employers should absolutely be held accountable for paying a livable wage but they don't and you know that. So knowing that and refusing to tip someone who is exposing themselves to you and others to get you that food, who spends their own money in gas, and who is a human being likely with financial problems of their own since they are willing to do that job in the middle of fucking pandemic is pretty shitty. You may not be wrong on principal that you shouldn't *have* to tip but you know the situation and if you still don't do it you're an asshole."

I also feel you're gate keeping a little , a disturbed sense of self is a main symptom which can lead to having a jarring reaction to your reflection. Stopping mid-cry and getting distracted by something (even by their own reflection) and suddenly being pleased (so switching from upset to pleased very quickly) seems more like BPD to me than NPD. 

It didn't read as boasting or cute to me, more so a lament of how some of us don't have a handle on our emotions or thought processes and it can lead to bizarre actions like stopping mid cry to take selfies. The absurdity of that is a little funny to some people. It might be scary to others, or upsetting, but it was funny to some people and I think that's totally okay. 

This is very serious and I agree that I dislike when people play off their mood swings or abuse of others as a quirk and something the other person just has to deal with - I just don't think this post was what you made it out to be and didn't seem to be trivializing anything in my opinion."

BPD,fiqpzk5,t3_f94yv9,1582649528.0,I experience this...also living out of my car but keeping my full time job. I think about this and about stealing cars all the time. I also think about leaving and cutting ties with everyone and pretending to be someone completely different. It's all faded a little as I've gotten older but I still think about it from time to time. Sometimes I actually worry about going through with it as I do have an established life. I never thought other people did this.
BoJackHorseman,fio0yx8,t1_finxy5l,1582574165.0,"I think it depends on how you want to see it but yeah he definitely doesn't get a happy ending. He lives though which gives him the possibility of a happier ending. He'll probably revert again but he has been and seems to still be trying to act better. From the first season to the last he actually has made a ton of progress, and I think the fact that he was willing to deal with his loved ones leaving him graciously was a sign he has grown a little. So to me that quote in question is reflective of his journey. Being better is going to be really difficult, it'll get easier if he keeps doing it but he's going to have to keep trying otherwise it will always be difficult. 

I disagree about PB though, I think he cares about Bojack he just doesn't connect with him like Diane does, he doesn't fully understand Bojack in that way but he doesn't have to to care about him. I think that's present in the Oscars episode where PB says something to Todd about Bojack's past and how it affects his actions."
BoJackHorseman,fin4ued,t1_fin0xwv,1582555808.0,"I think it ties into the larger theme of the show which stars Bojack though. The whole idea of the show seems to be not using excuses ""I am a bad person"" to justify bad behavior. The way to be a good person is to do good things, and it will be difficult but you can get into the habit of it by doing it every day and before you know it you've done more good than bad. So even though he doesn't actually say it it is the story of the show and the show is about him so I don't think this is that weird. 

Honestly the red flags line bothers me more. I like it but I don't think it's as integral to the theme of the show as this line and it gets so much attention."
BoJackHorseman,fiaw84e,t1_fhl9f0n,1582309619.0,"I think every person is supposed to represent different points of view on ethics and morals / life and death. The dinner was a long conversation about what it meant to be a good person in life, if death brings peace, who's life was important and why, ect. I think Corduroy was representative of impulse and chasing good feelings despite the consequences. This was all a dialogue in Bojack's head too so I think it was him arguing with himself about the topic and his brain supplied people who would be best fit for each discussion point."
BoJackHorseman,fiavsry,t1_fhwp2gi,1582309365.0,"As one of those assholes that relates to him (begrudgingly believe me) I am *really* glad they didn't do this. I like that the show makes the point that you don't get to undo your bad choices and you don't get to escape the consequences forever but the end isn't hopeless. So many people who relate to Bojack feel like they are better off dead and this was the first show that made that option terrifying and said ""that's not the way to go, it's a permanent answer to a temporary problem. Instead just do better in the future and deal with your past and maybe you can find peace."" I needed to know that, like so many other things in this show I needed to know. Dying wouldn't solve his problems. It wouldn't make the things he did bad suddenly right. I like that the show acknowledged that. Sorry I didn't mean to word vomit all over your conversation, haha."
BPD,fi3xcl8,t3_ei3rkd,1582129633.0,"Yeah I feel like there is a version of me most people know and no one knows me really. I feel that way all the time.

Or only 1 person knows about. So I have like a handful of people who each know a handful of secrets but none of them interact and so I feel like no one has the full picture."

I see this with my stepson all the time, he is used to Tik Tok length entertainment and has a hard time watching a show or movie even one he begs to watch. I've heard really good things about Daniel Tiger though and I'm glad it helped clean your son's palette after Caliou lol."

BoJackHorseman,fh696sl,t1_fh1bjhz,1581296322.0,"I guess you could make that argument but honestly that would be very poor storytelling and the way this show has worked so well in the past I don't think they would have showed us the door, showed Penny looking at it like ""oh okay"" and then made Bojack feel so guilty about it if it was supposed to be framed as an equal party contribution to a drunken accident. 

I think it is vague but the fact that Bojack feels so guilty about it has always been telling to me. Same woth the Sarah Lynn thing. He has always been desperate to outwardly excuse his actions but he can't keep up his lies to hinself because he knows he messed up."

BoJackHorseman,fguxwql,t1_fgua9j1,1581131935.0,"I hope this doesn't seem condescending but how recently have you watched the episode? After he talks to Charlotte and she rejects his advances and tells him he should leave Penny approaches him again and he verbally tells her to go to bed and then he walks into he room on the boat and leaves the door open for her. Again I don't think its cut and dry but he was hoping she would come in which is why he left it open. That's not great. 

Also agreed. This is a show that benefits from questions and discussions!"
BoJackHorseman,fgtgpus,t1_fgsltev,1581104231.0,"Listen I love Bojack. I relate to Bojack so much. He fucked up here though and in many other situations. The point isn't to excuse his behavior or be on his ""side"" it's to want him to clean up and choose to be better, part of which is being accountable. This can also be construed as rooting for him though, which I do.

Bojack was a much older man and the point isn't about force, he's supposed to be the more responsible adult in this situation. Penny and her friends have so little life experience compared to him. He is also a famous movie star. He also is a family friend who lived with Penny's families for some time. All of those things came together to make small choices he made the wrong choice. he recreated an experience he had with Charlotte with Penny, he told he she looked like her mom who was was obviously attracted to, and in the end when he's feeling down he leaves the door open for her to come in even though he can say he told her not to. I'm not denying she could have made better choices herself but he is definitely more in the wrong and she is completely entitled to feel like a victim now that she's grown up more. 

I don't think you should have been downvoted but that's just Reddit. People are disagreeing with you and despite how the downvote button was intended to be used it's basically used to show disagreement."

GossipGirl,fgq6qjw,t3_ezx5pa,1581018915.0,"This is a tough question. I think they both spend their whole teenage lives trying to prove their dads wrong. Serena sees her dad abandoning her as saying she's not worthy of love, and Bart constantly disapproves of everything Chuck is and does. 

I think Serena suffers more though. I feel like Chuck tries to make something of himself due to his daddy issues and while that comes off as unhealthy ambition sometimes it usually leads him to success. On the flip side Serena's constant craving for attention and love where she feels her dad left a hole leads her to making a lot of poor decisions in her relationships."
BoJackHorseman,fgp668d,t1_fg50o4x,1580997846.0,Oh so all Owls look the same to you?? (jk I thought so too).
BoJackHorseman,fgp63k5,t1_fg8gtl8,1580997792.0,"Yes here's the quote in case anyone is interested: 

""*You can live your happy Zelda life in this happy Zelda town, and pretend you're a happy Zelda. But I know you, and this isn't you. People don't change, Diane, not really.*

*Mr. Peanutbutter's a Zelda. He's happy and he's carefree and he's loving. But you and me, we're Zoës. We're Zoës, Diane. We're cynical and we're sad and we're mean. There's a darkness inside you, and you can bury it deep in burritos as big as your head. But someday soon this darkness is gonna come out, and when it does, I want you to call me.""*

That's what Wayne said to her and then she did go back to him and did something pretty unkind (I know she didn't think the book was mean but it was supposed to be Bojack's memoir, and he thought it was mean. So that's all that mattered really). I totally forgot that Wayne's quote came full circle!"

GossipGirl,fgm2hny,t3_ez3iuy,1580916662.0,"I think that considering their relationship was the only one in the main cast that grew from a real friendship he did love her. 

She and Chuck had something similar in the very beginning but as soon as they hooked up it was always about declarations and grand gestures. Similarly Dan idolized Serena and she viewed him as a sort of savior, neither of those seem real to me. Dan and Blair talking about their life, their dreams, movies, music, art, ect - that all seemed real. She did a lot of growing up and so did he, they both started out really close minded and judgmental but grew out of it when they formed a real connection. 

They were both hardworking, ambitious, intelligent, and interested in similar things as they grew up. They had so much more in common than Derena or Chair. I think with Chair in particular Blair and Chuck only had the worst parts of themselves in common, which makes for great drama but again not a real loving relationship. 

It's also one of the few relationships I can think of where Dan was able to sacrifice his happiness for a woman and not expect anything in return or feel owed, he just wanted to see her happy. Similarly it was the only relationship I can think of where Blair felt loved and safe in her relationship while also not feeling like she was losing herself in the other person.

 I'm still so salty they ripped apart even the friendship to make  way for the fan service couples in the last season."
relationship_advice,fgm19qv,t1_fgll5db,1580915883.0,I mean to be fair that mindset is new and basically a reaction to the long standing idea that women who sleep around lose value which has never or rarely been an idea applied to me. Also the point being that he brags about it to his current gf on dates in detail. That's either really socially stunted or he's insecure and wants to make himself look better.
relationship_advice,fgm0x4a,t3_ez73tv,1580915658.0,"I would definitely tell him that you don't want to hear about who he's slept with because it's really rude to randomly brag about that on a date (c'mon dude).

My guy is much older than me and also has a much longer list. It rarely gets brought up and never in a ""I hooked up with x girls"" way, more like he's telling me a funny or interesting story about his life and might mention it in passing (and I think only once did he actually talk about sex because it was relevant to the story).

My point is sex is private anyway and I think it doesn't look well on him to be blatantly talking about his ""exploits"" period, but much less on a date. If he gets offended with you telling him this or says you're being immature I would leave and let him do some growing up."

Anytime I couldn't see my legs I was nervous there was a snake near them or on them. So I'm saying it's more than just an initial shot of ""OMG EW!"" It's almost a legit phobia and yet I can appreciate that they are just animals trying to live their life and think a picture like this is sort of cute. It's weird. 

I agree though the context definitely makes a difference for most people!"
