FlightDispatch,fquy1ub,t3_gl1qa4,1589666277.0,"Can’t hurt to have the training. I went to IFOD in September last year and graduated in November and don’t regret it. Came from a background of absolutely no aviation experience, and I left feeling very confident in my abilities as a potential dispatcher. There’s a few companies who always look to hire new dispatchers (PSA and Envoy) I probably had 6 or 7 interviews before I was hired by a company. I got hired by a small regional one in Wisconsin who’s owned by United in early March. Sadly they called me a few weeks ago because so many dispatchers along with all sorts of other airline employees have been furloughed. There’s still a future for us, but until travel picks up it may be a bit harder to find a job. Doesn’t mean there won’t be any, but it may not be the one you’re wanting. Also be aware most dispatch jobs you’ll have to move to a hub city. Psa is in Dayton? And Envoy in Dallas. Some are in better spots than others. One thing that shocked me was the income. The Wisconsin one was going to be the highest out of all of them. Right at about 30k a year. The others I applied for were about 25-28k before taxes.. but I’ve met a few dispatchers who are making 100k after 20 years. So it’s nice to know there’s a possibility of that kind of income. I have a fear of flying and lost my job of 12 years when I went to IFOD. I def don’t regret that decision even without a job in aviation right now. It’s a challenging license to get and accomplishing it gave me a lot of confidence in my abilities. You can always get a job doing something else in aviation and when dispatcher positions open up for that company you’ll be considered quicker too. I had a few classmates who were schedulers and fueling planes. The companies they worked for paid for the training."

PublicFreakout,fquat8h,t3_gktbfa,1589655364.0,"It basically takes a major mechanical error, or total pilot fuck up, or a mother plane crashing into you to bring a plane down. Turbulence will suck, but it can handle it. And even if you lost an engineer or something major, in the USA you’re probably within 1 hour or so of a major airport if you needed to land. Which sounds like a lot of time, but it’s not when you factor in decent altitude and the speed. So really within about 15 mins they could have a dispatcher say go here and land within 30-45.  

As much as with think the plane will magically fall out of the sky it won’t. Hell you could glide for a good bit to the nearest airport if you had to. 

There’s so much redundancy on a plane that the most common error will be human error. A 2 engine plane can fly 1 hour in still air with one engine in op.  A 3 or more engine plane can go 2 hours in op in still air.  You have 45 mins of reserve fuel almost everywhere you go an you’re not supposed to use it unless it’s the end of the world and aliens landed at your airport and you had to go to the next one after you’ve already floated around a bit. There’s so much that goes into letting a plane fly “legally” that it has to be a freak accident or again human error to cause an issue. 

Now, that kind of turbulence there, either the dispatcher didn’t read the weather charts and pipreps right, or the pilot deviated in some way from the flight plan. Some turbulence can be expected if the weathers rough, but that kind is usually being avoided big time."

So unemployment for now is a better option for me, and if a client wants to track a vocal or have me mix a song remotely at least I can keep that on the dl with cash. 

Just try and have faith and stay positive things will bounce back in some way. This virus may not be going anywhere for a while, but eventually everyone’s going to have to take that risk of working and going out. It’s gonna suck, and it’s scary, but it’s just now our economy works sadly. 

Chances are you won’t be evicted if this carries on. Too many people are jobless and fearing that too. I think landlords would rather take a loss for a few months, and at worst raise rent the following year or ask for back pay.. that or look for government bailouts. Either way if you stay and even aren’t paying, you’re still a tenant for the future which is money they’ll eventually get. Kicking thousands out while they aren’t working will only leave thousands of empty spaces, which would end up lowering prices. 

I’m hoping by June I can pick up a few small gigs. Even if they’re just people wanting backyard parties or house shows of under 20 people.  Anything to keep making some cash. Just look at this time to learn and improve your skills. Maybe try marketing yourself more. That’s another thing I’m doing.

So when I do program anything it’s very basic.. almost too basic. So I get upset at that. Lol hell I can’t even bring myself to program electronic music cus I get so critical.

It basically says you weren’t paying enough attention while driving. Get enough of them and you shouldn’t be behind a wheel cus you’re putting others at risk..  like why argue that? 😞

I won the case 2 years later. Came at a perfect time cus my health got real bad and I had to quit my job of 12 years. The money was just enough to get me through about 4 months after medical bills. I actually got a decent chunk because of my car insurance, but my medical bills at the time racked up to like 50k. And I never had a surgery. And apparently when you sue someone from a car accident and have health insurance, the health insurance company gets all if not almost all of their money back. I think I had about 10k left in my pocket. Still was nice, but got spent on bills and at hospitals since I didn’t have health insurance at the time. 

The concussion was weird. I felt fine after the wreck and went to work. (I’m an audio engineer) was mixing a band live, then suddenly had a migraine come on real quick. Lights got brighter, and had halos, I started to get clammy and panicked, threw up and fainted at the board. The guitarist saw me pass out and jumped off stage to check on me. After a few slaps and something to drink I came to. Drank some coffee, and smoked some herb for my headache and nausea. Prob shouldn’t have at the time but I had to get through the gig. Thankfully I could sit for the rest of it, but I had to move equipment that night. Never unloaded it from my car though. When I left the gig I drove straight to the hospital and by then I was crying from the pain in my back and head. They did an mri and cat scan. My l1-l4 were totally out of whack. Like a shaped and bulging, my t5 and t6 were fractured and shifted to the left and right, my c5 and c6 has impacted my spinal cord. So much that they scheduled a surgery 2 weeks out if they couldn’t get it moved a bit quick. I was already dealing with neuropathy in my hands and weakness in my legs. Within a few days I actually pissed myself and didn’t know it cus I was losing feeling there. My left arm/hand locked up real bad within a month. Still have issues with it but it’s manageable. More like bad arthritis now with some tingling. I think I went to the er 4 times from that wreck. All cus the pain flare ups. I stayed on oxys 20mg for almost a year straight, flexeril 15mg, diclofenac, tramadol and gabapentin. Which only added to the problems when I got off them. I had muscle groups no longer responding to physical therapy. Like my glutes wouldnt engage at all..  Had to try and get off the oxys.. thankfully I wasn’t taking them at the high a dose I was told. I took the bare minimum and gave myself days off as shitty as they were.. once I got off most the meds I started looking into alternative treatments. I ended up getting on massive doses of testosterone. That def sped the recovery up lol along with gave me a boost mentally. That year was quit a shitty one lol 
Looking back my drs should have probably given me testosterone and an anabolic steroid during physical therapy. It would have def sped up the process and saved me a lot of time. Buuut that’s not what the medical industry wants lol"

Cops were surprised she didn’t kill the children in the car. 8 kids in a 7 person car..  her hood was gone, engine ripped out, windshield destroyed from a kid smacking it..  I ran out to help but she refused any.  So I called 911.  Ended up having to sue her cus she had a revoked license, criminal record, and no insurance. I drove off and went to work only to collapse later that day from a concussion and whiplash. Spent the next year in physics therapy  due to multiple damaged discs. 

It’s scary to think right now a lot of people are being given a license without a road test. And you are right. After 15-20 years someone should be re-evaluated when it comes to their road skills. Eye site doesn’t mean shit if you can’t pay attention 😞"

One thing I’ve debated about trying now is doing a normal dose and trying to figure out what exactly is going on with sounds, and if it could help raise my voice again.

I still debate about buying a Harley, but after trying out the Iron 883 and the 1200 I still loved my scout more. The power and maneuverability are pretty drastic.  Still debating about an FTR S or a Triumph Speedmaster. For all the bikes out there, everyone seems to be making a better bike under 15k

I will say this though, Harley has a tighter and larger community. The only people I know who ride Indians are hanging around the dealership. Don’t see many riders around. Harley riders are eveeeeerywhere.. but the irony is that when I’m caught riding my scout Harley guys are like oh shit that’s a scout! I’d love to own one of those. It’s almost like they’re so loyal to Harley they dare not test the waters. Just admire from afar."

If the owner drove an old beat up truck and was stressing his ass off and on the verge of suicide, I think the driver would understand.. but drive a Ferrari and deny your employees pay, fuck that guy. I hope other drivers quit and move on to better companies."

researchchemicals,fpq6ina,t1_fpppelh,1588816158.0,"Damn s that’s sad. I had a friend who ended up like that. He always wanted to hang with me and get high, but he was younger and pretty reckless. More so than me at the time. So I never even smoked pot with him, but he found substances his own way.. ended up overdosing on coke along with I opiates later on. Kept doing psychedelics too often..   now he’s basically a burnt out schizophrenic☹️ it’s sad.   Hell I worry about a female friend of mine cus almost every time I talk to her or see her she’s tripping on acid or mushrooms. I know they’re somewhat safer but I’d only trip 5-6 times a month if that. Had a few times I’d do a bit more, but I didn’t live that way all year round. Thankfully she’s alright for now..  but i still worry with acid. When I did it in the late 90s early 2000s it was either lsd or bunk. Now you’re probably getting 1p lsd or something if you’re lucky. If not prob nbmoe.. which scares me. I won’t touch that. 

Yea I’m sure all the drugs in my system def played a role then. 

Really? That’s crazy. The headspace is def clearer on amt. at least at the dose I did. Idk how big of one they had, but acid.. I’d just be constantly going what? What??? And laughing. Then wondering why I’m laughing. Lol"

researchchemicals,fppmk8i,t1_fppm0u8,1588805063.0,"Yea I was a dumb 17 year old at the time. Didn’t think about any of that. I had also been tripping on robotussin and mushrooms earlier that week. 

Jeez. That’s a terrible. Is she better now? 
I’m glad I came out of whatever happened to me. Another friend of mine did some that next weekend and they ended up on the roof of their apt building after running around naked screaming in the hallway. Fire dept and police got called and even the local news station made it out there. They got him down and I think he spent a few days in the hospital but eventually recovered. 

I’m guessing that’s why amt was scheduled. Isn’t it a maoi? And wasn’t it was an antidepressant in Russia or something for a while? It never felt that powerful to me.. but I certainly learned my lesson"
researchchemicals,fppk455,t1_fppjkgc,1588803754.0,"Yea I knew 2 other people who freaked out on the same batch of amt I did. I don’t even remember freaking out honestly. Or well the build up to it. 

I know I drank milk on it which apparently was a big no no.. and I did coke along with smoking weed. So I def think that contributed to it.. but all I remember was one min I’m smoking the next I’m pissed off and ripping my clothes off, chipped a tooth, and I’m starting to say some crazy shit. Had my friends holding me down, and I had an out of body like experience. I could see them holding me while I’m ranting about all sorts of shit. Mentally I felt sober. It was like I was laughing at myself. Like damn you’ve really fucked yourself over this time. Maybe 15-20 mins went by like that? Hell idk.. but as soon as I was in it I was out. I suddenly yell at my friends to get off me and I stood up and puked this neon greenish vomit. Then I felt great and kept tripping another 8 or so hours."

They already take advantage of non disabled employees, but the ones who are.. they’re practically slave labor. If I recall the law doesn’t state they have to be paid any kind of livable wage. So they could be making 10 cents an hour and it’s fine. Goodwill did that. 😞"
