InsightfulQuestions,fo0n4em,t3_g4nzax,1587416107.0,"In the begining of all this, I hoped that now is the one and single time during my lifetime that there could be some huge changes in society all over the world. I hoped that now would be the perfect time for a universal basic income. I hoped that, with a huge distance to their normal everyday lives, people can see the injustices of our current societies even more and that they would have time to reflect upon them in isolation, instead of distracting themselves constantly. I hoped that this collective experience would bring us closer together, as one global community. I hoped, that in the face of death we once again know the things worth living for.
But then again, one or two months into this crisis, I am not so sure anymore. It is blatantly obvious that this crisis hits those people and societies that were vulnerable before, either because of a weaker immun system or worse economical status. I am worried about the global financial and economical crisis that will follow because, again, it will hit the poorest the hardest."

I tried to spin it a bit further and took a look at the main character's name, Rosa. The name itself obviously comes from the flower and it could symbolize the good in the human struggle that consists of the evil things we are able to do but also the guilt we feel about it and our good sides. The flower could symbolize the beauty of humankind in contrast to our darker actions.

Googling the name Rosa also brought me to an interesting historical character that has to do something with the topic of slave trade.
From the wiki article about Rosa Dr Carvalho Alvarenga:

>Rosa de Carvalho Alvarenga also known as Dona Rosa de Cacheu and Na Rosa ('Senhora Rosa') (1780s – d. after 1857), was a Euro-African nhara slave trader.

>She was the **daughter of the Portuguese Manuel de Carvalho Alvarenga from Cape Verde and an African woman** and the sister of governor Francisco de Carvalho Alvarenga. She married the Portuguese official Joao Pereira Barreto (1772–1829) and became the mother of Honorio Pereira Barreto (1813-1859), who was governor in 1830-59. **She traded in slaves, cotton, rice and beeswax and played an important role as the business channel between the Portuguese and the indigenous African population**. She also acted as a political diplomat and mediator between the Portuguese and the indigenous African population, particularly during the warfare of the 1840s. At one point in the 1850s, she achieved a near monopoly of the slave trade of the region

Just like Rosa in the show, who is the daughter of a black man and a white woman, she is somehow the connecting point between the history of slave trade and the involvement of Ares in that. Interesting here is, that this historical figure of Rosa becomes a slave trader herself, despite of her heritage and at the same time because of it. Rosa in the show is also not a morally flawless character. She tricks Fleur to get replaced as the assistant and she kills her own friend Jacob. 

I think the same moral ambiguity also works for the name Carmen, which makes me think of the opera Carmen. A woman who is standing between two fronts.

Edit:
And of course, the name of the show, Ares, the Greek god of war."

From the wiki:

>Liberia began as a settlement of the American Colonization Society (ACS), who believed black people would face better chances for freedom and prosperity in Africa than in the United States. The country declared its independence on July 26, 1847. The U.S. did not recognize Liberia's independence until February 5, 1862, during the American Civil War. Between January 7, 1822, and the American Civil War, more than 15,000 freed and free-born black people who faced legislated limits in the U.S., and 3,198 Afro-Caribbeans, relocated to the settlement. The settlers carried their culture and tradition with them. The Liberian constitution and flag were modeled after those of the U.S. On January 3, 1848, Joseph Jenkins Roberts, a wealthy, free-born African American from Virginia who settled in Liberia, was elected Liberia's first president after the people proclaimed independence."
