Computers in chess are significantly better so they nerf themselves to let people beat them occasionally whereas in duel links the computer doesn’t actually understand anything it’s doing it’s just activating cards it can activate. I personally just don’t get much sense of pride in beating a bot at a strategy game that they’re ill equipped to understand. At least with humans their mistakes you understand whereas the AI will do completely nonsensical things constantly. If I have an Anki, and they can’t beat over it they will just set monsters until I win via direct attacks lol. At least when ur PVPing, the enemy can actually understand threats and attempt to counter them in a smart way."

Everyone can practice fire before they go on the show and women can absolutely make fire just as well as men can, I don’t understand why we’re trying to pretend like women can’t do that. Also, recently more women have found idols than men including last night vs the two biggest dudes who find idols everywhere. I think while there’s maybe some unconscious bias from producers towards male winners that it doesn’t have a big effect and the bigger issue is simply the evolution of the game favoring big moves, which women are targeted greatly for making whereas men typically can do them without repercussions.

Rascha's effect is this

This card can attack directly. If this card is Normal Summoned: Target 1 to 3 cards you control, but not more than your opponent has in their hand; shuffle them into the Deck, then discard the same number of random cards from your opponent's hand (or as many as possible), and if you do, this card gains 1000 ATK for each card discarded by this effect.

It didn't get destroyed after necrovalley left the field? On his turn, he just drew, activated Rex's ability which took me down to 1 LP. Thankfully I had an out to it but this seems like it's bugged or do I just not know how card effects work. Shouldn't it have been destroyed after Necrovalley was?"

Saying he’s not a good player is just insane though, back to back final 3s playing his type of game, if he were a girl he’d be beloved on this sub. Just because he’s a huge tool doesn’t mean his gameplay wasn’t top tier. He brought his alliance back from like a 7-4 merge and brought the exact two people he wanted to the final 3. There’s never been a more dominant single player except Kim. His one flaw is the glaring lack of a social game but that doesn’t make him a bad player. He’s not the GOAT by any means but calling him a bad player is just silly. Know who’s a bad player? Chet. Just cause you don’t like someone doesn’t mean you have to think they’re a bad player. I don’t like Ben, but I don’t think he’s a bad player because I’m not a fan..."
survivor,fpe8pls,t1_fpd9i7r,1588542591.0,I’m catching up on all of the older seasons and the first I watched was game changers cause I’ve been a huge Sarah fan on WAW so far. Season wasn’t that great but I’m a huge Sarah fan.
AgainstDegenerateSubs,fpcblwm,t1_fpcb3s5,1588494435.0,"I’ll never understand how such hatred can come out of such a loving religion. Jesus says to love thy neighbor, yet you have unprovoked showed utter contempt towards millions of people.  It is telling that your initial comment was removed for the use of an incredibly ignorant and offensive slur. I never once told him to contact me, I told him that there are plenty of resources out there for troubled teens including the church. Yet somehow I have a feeling that you’ll believe any of the organizations who offer support to young people such as him are the true evil in this world despite the Church’s rampant issue with priests lecherous behavior towards young boys. You label the Pope who best represents Christ’s own words, the one who speaks of this plight within the priesthood, as a heretic. Hatred and misunderstanding has clouded your heart and mind and I hope you go on a spiritual journey so that you may accept the true love of Jesus again. Love thy neighbor, regardless of their sexual orientation. There is no place in this world for hate. 


> If anyone says, “I love God,” and hates his brother, he is a liar; for he who does not love his brother whom he has seen cannot love God whom he has not seen

AgainstDegenerateSubs,fpc9vbx,t1_fpc9lh6,1588492637.0,"You should probably reevaluate your morals if you believe that telling someone to be introspective and look within themselves is somehow even remotely a sign of predatory behavior. I genuinely have no idea why you believe the things you do, but I hope you calm down and try to allow a hint of rationality and empathy in your mind. What specific aspect of my advice to a clearly troubled teenager do you believe was incorrect? Telling him to stay healthy and happy? To go on a journey of self discovery? I can’t even fathom how you got what you believe you got from my innocuous comment."
AgainstDegenerateSubs,fpc5x6p,t1_fpc3d5k,1588488679.0,"I don’t really care about the subreddit drama and I’m sure I’ll be downvoted, I’m really sorry to hear you’re struggling like this. Teenage years can be so incredibly difficult, if you ever need someone to reach out to there’s so many resources out there. Pope Francis has made it clear he doesn’t believe homosexuality is a sin and I don’t think you need to stress out about this so much, I’m sure it’s incredibly difficult for you right now. If the church gives you guidance that’s great but right now you’re at such a formative moment in your life I think it’s best if you try and make this self discovery for yourself. Plenty of people are happily homosexual and still devout Catholics, you might simply be bi or some other place on the spectrum. You’re also 15, your identity is still changing rapidly. You should try your best to do some self reflection on the topic, maybe reach out to some gay Christians for advice on what they went through, maybe that’ll help you out.  Hopefully you come through this a happy and healthy person, I’d also recommend getting off reddit or at least drama subs such as these, they can be incredibly toxic and right now you should be focusing on positivity. Cheers"

moderatepolitics,fp9plhc,t1_fp9pd0d,1588431845.0,"? If Biden’s worse political enemies aren’t bringing this accusation up it speaks to the credibility she has among the people who are most likely to believe her. Fox has zero moral high ground here, also, you realize Kavanaugh is literally a Supreme Court justice now? Right?"
moderatepolitics,fp9ozxb,t1_fp9otwa,1588431469.0,"The mere fact that zero republicans are bringing the story up as though it has any validity is enough. Even Fox News isn’t jumping all over this, maybe it simply isn’t as credible as fringe parts of Reddit wants to believe?"
moderatepolitics,fp9ohi5,t1_fp9o71q,1588431145.0,"I mean the only thing I remember was Democrats saying we needed to have an investigation into the situation and the GOP rushed ahead without one. That’s literally vetting claims, not to mention she testified at risk of perjury whereas rheade has changed her story like 5 times. You can try to pretend there’s a direct parallel all you want but it simply isn’t the same situation."
VALORANT,fp75hct,t1_fp759e0,1588364410.0,"There’s no way that’s ever happened to anyone, do you have proof of this? Unless you have like 2000 losses in silver 1 there’s no way you win 15 games in a row without ranking up. Just doesn’t happen. I’m not even trying to defend their system as I agree it’s dumb, but don’t just make stuff up lol"
survivor,fp6vq3c,t1_fp6umxw,1588359412.0,"I mean I agree but who’s making the judgement and what are the limits? I don’t really use twitter at all but the only time I have said anything hateful was towards the president after something despicable he said. Should I not be allowed to use social media? I agree with you in general though because often times people do get ridiculous amounts of hate for absolutely no reason. It’s honestly baffling to me, Ben is annoying the hell out of me this season but it’s never once crossed my mind that I should find him on twitter and tell him that. What’s the point? I’ve never understood why people get so bold on platforms like that."
survivor,fp6ubgn,t1_fp4ffhe,1588358720.0,Curious how you see that actually working
VALORANT,fp6po8j,t1_fp6kz2e,1588356433.0,"The one things that allows for CS is that with enough data we’d have a pretty damn good idea about the exact things you need to do to rank up, eg. around MVPS ADR Utility damage etc. If we know the exact number change after every match that could potentially be an issue, personally I definitely hope that they add it somehow."
