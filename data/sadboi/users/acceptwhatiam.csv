japan,eyh1rn6,t1_ey7zuyx,1567080421.0,"Lastly, i think it is not true that the goverment follow the general trend, the atmosphere that general ppl have made. Actuallg it is somewhat more like vice versa. Some left politicians tweeted that korean ppl should be resent quoting lee sun shin, the most respected naval general in korean history who fought against japan. They explicitly intended to provoke anti japan sentiment. 

 Recently north korea launched missiles several time. During Sk - usa joint drill,on the official announcement sk government even alternated the way to call this joint drill not to offen nk. The threat often comes from japan, but sk carried out more expanded military exercise in dokdo in this climate. I am korean and i know and believe that dokdo is under korean sovereignty. So we dont have to care when we do defense drills in our land. But in terms of diplomacy, sk cares too much about nk and cares too less about japan. I dont think nk is sk' brother or ally. Sorry that this is off the point"
japan,eygzjy2,t1_ey7zuyx,1567079345.0,"And i totally agree with the mention ""very ethnic nationalistic at the same time when involving japan"". I would rather modify it to ""mostly ethnic nationalistic and this get even more severe when involving japan"" there r many ppl who actively participate in the boycotting. But almost half of them do it because they care about other koreans, not because they hate japanese. Recently, national sentiment has get more anti japan. It is true. But not majority of us think the boycott is the solution. A considerable number of koreans r calling for a better, calmer way to settle down the problem."
japan,eygy0lj,t1_ey7zuyx,1567078608.0,"As i am a koean, i dont agree with some points u made here. I wil lwrite what i felt as a korean. 
Just bear my broken english with tolerance. 

1. Although lee myung bak visited dokdo and aroused tension at the end of his presidency, he was pro japan actually. He has even been criticized being pro japan in south korea. The conservative bloc in sk is considered pro japan and the left bloc is close to nk and china. Even the think-tank, research lab of the first ruling party the minju, wrote a report that claimed -thanks to- the escalated tension between sk and japan, the support for the moon jae in government would rise. 
2. Moon jae in government is the most pro Nk ever as far as i know.  27 years old, i have lived in sk for the whole my life till now, i experienced 5 presidencies. And moon jae in is the most pro nk president ever. He seem to have been totally immersed in issues related to nk. Even before he became the president, it was his top priority issue.  He wrote it in his essays too. During moon's presidency, diplomatic politicians have been reluctant to cooperate to the u.s.a. 'The pro-nk left bloc versus the pro usa and japan right bloc' is really exists."
AskReddit,esrwb7f,t3_bxfzf4,1562238690.0,"Im a korean. And i personally have affection for japan as i stayed for half a year in japan when i was a univ student. Despite the political diputes and historical problems being unsolved( i think politicians in each country make historical problem even worse for their own sakes..) , civil realtions is still going on and expands. i admit that  some anti-japan atmiosphere still exists in korea, however it is not dominant. Individual Japanese and korean can be closer. As generation changes and social exchange between japanese and korean youth grows, i hope the relations get better. We young people are comparatively more capable of seeing history apart from the political position. Hope that korea-japan can be nearest and closest neighbors.."
