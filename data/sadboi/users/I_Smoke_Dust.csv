Than 9 *minutes*, but it does go much earlier than that if I'm actually using the phone, particularly with making phone calls. Besides that though there's no speaker besides the shitty, muffled one used for talking, like with your ear to the phones. This means the phone can't ring anymore, only vibrate or silent(the vibration is shit also, naturally), can't use speakerphone, etc. It randomly fucks up to where I can't read any texts until I turn the phone off and on again, I literally get **no** service near me, so people can't reach me and I can't reach them, both at home and at work(my boss loves this). The only hope is that once it gives me the option to have the text I wanna send marked as ""pending"" that it eventually sends during whatever brief sliver of a window that I get 1 bar of service, bit usually it ends up failing and never sends the text. The back cover of the phone broke in half, and I lost the top half at work a long time ago, so it's always exposed, and now I have no volume buttons so I need something to poke the circuitry underneath where the buttons should be to change the volume. And oh yeah, it's an ""Obama phone,"" so it's just some cheap, free government phone that would make any random flip phone from 2006 look like a godsend.

Not once have I seen you shit on Ayton or anything close to it, and even better is how much you've gone out of your way to actually praise Ayton and give him credit where and when it's due.

And of course there are somehow still some who've never came around and continue to proclaim that he not really any good or even that he was trash lol. Shit, the fact that there were so many people like this that were *actual Dallas fans* themselves just goes to show how much of a media bias there was against him. This fact especially made it clear that there was indeed a strong narrative being pushed in the media(mostly social media) that he was garbage/not good. Like why the fuck would the guy's own team's fans turn on him? Because they just regurgitate the same idiotic nonsense that all these other clowns and haters would spew out of their mouths, instead of thinking, looking, watching, analysing, and deciding for themselves whether or not he actually was a good QB or not.

Edit: But yeah, as for Dak(lol) there's just no logical explanation as to why he doesn't get the same credit or praise that Wentz does, outside of people just hating on him due to the team he plays for, plain and simple. Dak has better passing stats, way better rushing stats, a better W/L record, more 4th quarter comebacks and game-winning drives(and this can't be discredited by pointing out how he's had more opportunities though, because he's also got a much better W/L ratio in situations where they've attempted 4th quarter comebacks and game-winning drives), a laughably more durable history as far as injuries go, etc. Like Wentz really has nothing on Dak, and by the way you hear about the comparison you'd think Wentz doesn't not have any single aspect of the game on Dak."

Being a millionaire today doesn't necessarily mean shit honestly, unless a person has like an 8 or 9 figure net worth. Like take my grandparents for example, they're technically millionaires I suppose, but they're the complete opposite of the type of people Bernie wants to go after. They don't fit the mold at all and have only ever helped out the community, never ones to take advantage of anyone or anything even really. They're pretty much the prototypical example of model citizens who went after the American dream and absolutely succeeded in doing so, taking no shortcuts along the way, accomplishing all their goals along the way with help from nobody but each other.

My grandpa made his living working for Remax for quite a while I believe, and eventually was able to leave them behind and start his own real estate business. Over time he's accumulated a long list of clients, as well a pretty good source of income and at least a few properties, everything had been obtained and accomplished through hard, honest, nonstop work.

A person like this couldn't have become a millionaire 30 or 40 years ago just by working hard, being an honest, smart individual who saves wisely, doesn't waste, and does good work. Even just 1 million 40 years ago was a small fortune, and you can see why Bernie would equate someone who had this kind of hoard of wealth back then with the rich and powerful that promote and propagate inequality.

I mean, imo no, I still wouldn't have considered them a good team by the end of the year, but definitely average anyways. Then you've got the fact that Darnold played one of the best games of his career, maybe even the best to date. Outside of the one pick he had, he was on fire and also has the stats to back it up. Lastly there's 1 more huge asterisk to put up next to this defeat, all the crucial injuries we had that sidelined a lot of guys for that game. I forget all the specific injuries, but I believe there were 4 key guys out for us, and I wanna say they were Cobb, Gallup, Byron, and one of the linemen, maybe Tyron. Our offense was hit hard at the time with these injuries.

...I love how amazingly sidetracked the conversation has become btw lmao, totally went off on a crazy tangent there.

Edit: Actually apparently Byron and Amari played. With Amari I might've been thinking about how he was hampered with the foot injury, but still played. Or maybe he left the game early? Idk, but the injury shows, since apparently he only had 1 reception, for 3 yards lol.

Edit 2: Ok, so there's this:

It's just like why NE in the past 2 decades or so has had an easier division schedule than the other teams in the AFC East, they got to play 3 shitty-mediocre teams twice almost every year, while the others usually played 2 shitty-mediocre teams and what was often literally and otherwise at least close to the best team in the league twice. That was certainly a more extreme example of lopsidedness though, the teams other than the best 1 in the NFC West this year are much better than those Jets, Dolphins, and Bills teams were any of those years just about, and SF is certainly not quite on the level of the Pats dynasty teams of the past 2 decades.

Edit: Though actually yeah now that I think about it you're definitely right, I'd take switching one of the lesser teams in the NFC West out for having to play SF if it meant I also got to play the Panthers and Lions instead of the Saints and Packers.

Edit: Also, if you're worried about the Seahawks then I'd say it would make sense to also be worried about Dallas, especially if they can get some of these suspensions overturned to help bolster that defensive front 7.

As for the team people are mostly happymost of the time I'd say, but there are a decent amount of negative fans who just wanna complain about shit all the time. I think all those Super Bowl victories spoiled them and set their expectations too high. I was only a toddler during the last one though unfortunately. Even a lot of the positive fans can flip in an instant when shit starts going wrong and the losses pile up. The 2018 season was so fucking annoying on the sub, they started the season 3-5 and it was all doom and gloom, everyone must be fired, just nonstop fucking whining. Then sure enough it was all for nothing, they ended up going 10-6 and making the playoffs anyways."
AZCardinals,fptsnw6,t1_fpsmsa9,1588897466.0,"Yeah I know how it was for Cards fans back then when they were still in the East, though yeah only been watching since ~2005. Whenever I mention this on here people usually look down on me for liking Dallas also lol, and I can see why. Whenever I mention it on the Cowboys sub though people don't ever give me shit for also liking the Cards, and I can also see why for that one lol.

Edit: But yeah, grew up in AZ with a Cowboys fan father."
OpiatesRecovery,fpqpplg,t1_fppxeyu,1588828730.0,"That's what I'm saying, the one thing that's always made me really regret using and feel bad when I do is my family members' dismay for it. With none of that to worry about and even some encouragement instead I'd have nothing stopping me from feeling bad at all about using really."
OpiatesRecovery,fpqpefr,t1_fppvv7i,1588828488.0,"I mean, it *is* pretty valuable technically, financially speaking."
OpiatesRecovery,fpqp9z4,t1_fppqk3k,1588828392.0,"Yeah, especially with a bunch of my family members there partaking in it, encouraging it, I would've caved also most likely."
AZCardinals,fpqp3e6,t1_fpqdvcx,1588828250.0,"Damn, technically they have every single team in the NFC West projected to have a winning record, that's nuts. I mean, I guess it depends on how you look at it since really 8.1-8.3 projected wins would all round down to an even 8-8 record. *Actually* I guess if you wanna be **really** technical the closest record to 8.1-8.3 would be 8-7-1, which is still all winning records lol."
AZCardinals,fpqo8fk,t1_fpqh49u,1588827601.0,"Ha Dallas is my other team besides the Cards(NFL only, no Mavs, etc.), so technically I got that guy anyways, but what's even cooler and certainly crazier is they also got CD Lamb! Between the Cards' and Cowboys' luck I was very pleased after the first round, and of course much more of the rest of the Cardinals draft as well."
AZCardinals,fpqny3v,t1_fppzd5i,1588827385.0,"Honestly I was expecting both Simmons *and* Wills to be gone when our pick came up, and certainly that at least 1 of them would be anyways, but they were both there still somehow! Maybe that's what was seemingly making the FO take so long to make the pick, I'm pretty sure we only had ~1:00-1:30 left when they put the pick in."
AZCardinals,fpp5mvi,t1_fpp3h2f,1588796382.0,"Yeah I'm in New Jersey currently and my two teams are the Cards and Cowboys so same here for the most part. At least with Dallas though they're on primetime games pretty frequently, much to the dismay of the people who don't like them lol."
cowboys,fpp3yf2,t1_fpp0wp2,1588795544.0,"Yeah that's ridiculous, I could maybe see the same guy somehow committing/getting called for that penalty twice in the same game, but it being called on 2 different players it's absurd, at least statistically speaking anyways."
suboxone,fpp3pnk,t1_fpp34cs,1588795421.0,"Yeah those people can get fucked honestly, it's night and day comparing a user's life on dope to their life on suboxone. *Technically*, being on suboxone isn't being *sober*, but it most certainly does count as being **clean**."
AZCardinals,fpp3fo9,t1_fpm3xqc,1588795280.0,"Dude all 3 of my teams have been absolutely killed by close game defeats over the past year's season. The Cards you know, then there's the Suns who had a complete shit record in one score/close games, and finally I believe the worst of all was the Cowboys(sorry, dad raised me to be a Cowboys/Cards fan in Arizona). Dallas had losses of 2, 2, 4, 4, ,7, 8, 10, and 11 points, which was their worst loss. What's maybe even crazier is that their lowest margin of *victory* was **8** points, their other wins were by 10, 18, 19, 23, 25, 27, and 31 points! I think they had like the 5th best net rating/points, but still finished .500 somehow lol."
AZCardinals,fpp1rij,t1_fpkop9d,1588794451.0,"I mean, it's really not all that bad though honestly, and it could be **so** much worse. When I found the sports streams on Reddit awhile back it was a fucking godsend, I was used to the shittiest streams ever at the time. The streams I would find and have to sit through were terrible, tons of ads just to get to the video, stupid countdowns before you could close ads and finally try to see what the stream looks like, constant stuttering, buffering, freezing, streams going off and on and off completely all the time, the worst fucking quality audio and video especially, like 360p was above average and great honestly.

Edit: And of course there were the times where I couldn't find any streams or even worse, the time before I knew about streams/they existed. Having the follow along with the NFL.com gamecast thingy just reading the lines of what happened lol, not even getting to see it."
cowboys,fpp0ihx,t1_fpludoq,1588793832.0,"I definitely remember this, the fury was intense, but I'm not sure if they were both called on the same player or not?"
nba,fpozno2,t1_fpjltdj,1588793409.0,"Definitely gotta give you the 2nd jump and possibly the not being as fluid mid-air lol, though not sure about that one and more importantly not sure just how much that would matter and come into play. Either way though, it's very clear Ayton generally wins in this area we're talking about, he's more athletically and physically gifted than probably 99%+ of people his size, though of course that's not exactly a big sample pool lol."
suboxone,fpoz6pt,t3_geknl7,1588793181.0,"Wow, 5-6 hours in with 10 comments and 25 upvotes, and not a single douche has chimed in yet with that bullshit about suboxone ""not counting as clean time,"" I am impressed and pleased."
cowboys,fpjhefp,t1_fpjc2kl,1588668578.0,"That's honestly a huge detail lol, makes it much less interesting imo."
nba,fpjh5xl,t1_fpitv1j,1588668324.0,"I will definitely give you that he's more aggressive than Ayton and that can be a positive, sometimes not though as you alluded to. I'm not so sure about having just as much lateral quickness though and Ayton has him beat on just about every measurable, his strength, length, athleticism, fluidity, etc are all better."
cowboys,fpjgyow,t1_fpin76h,1588668109.0,"Couldn't agree more, and I've hated him for it ever since."
OpiatesRecovery,fpij24j,t1_fphoesa,1588641936.0,"Well, you'd know better than I'd know, but I feel it's probably not too farfetched that fent could be there more than people think. I know where I've been using lately the people I've talked to who were using just a few years back in the same area said that it wasn't all fentanyl then like it is now. You're probably right though, more than likely not fentanyl."
cowboys,fpih65e,t1_fpho6a7,1588640819.0,"What gets me isn't just that also, but the fact that they went with the fucking rookie over the seasoned vet, who was also in his prime(when he actually was able to stay on the field, I know)."

nba,fpibjnz,t1_fp8h8nj,1588637536.0,"Wow, you're pretty low on Ayton compared to...well, just about any Suns fan I see on Reddit lol."
nba,fpiaxgq,t1_fp8rrgm,1588637177.0,What's even crazier imo is Ayton has had a better FT% than Doncic both years lol.
nba,fpi8q2y,t1_fp8n2f6,1588635908.0,"I know this post is old now, but are we really comparing Ayton's potential/ceiling to Bagley's lol? There was a clear gap in this regard before they got drafted, and it's only widened since, I would even say significantly with Ayton's defensive improvement."
IdiotsInCars,fphmbow,t1_fpgb4r3,1588623802.0,"The fucking impact made me jump slightly, scared me a bit honestly lol. It seemed so quiet so I turned it up pretty loud and I didn't exactly see the impact coming so it took me by surprise when that loud ass crash happened."
