relationship_advice,fqickbj,t1_fqi6vxj,1589394198.0,"Ahh translation stuff is hard. Yeah I get it. Glad it’s not a reoccurring thing. maybe a weighted blanket then? A lot of people say weighted blankets help with anxiety and the need of physical touch. I have a huge one for when I get flash backs and what not. You can get some that are relatively cheap and come in different weights. Also there are different self holding the techniques that help. Like a palm on the forehead and the other palm on the upper stomach area with light pressure. Maybe when you initiate the hug have a blanket with you so you can wrap her up and the slight pressure and weight will be there when you end the hug. There are a lot of tools out there that can help with her lack of physical touch. 

Setting boundaries is still a thing. Keep trying those in conjunction with the above. Hopefully it’s just the quarantine things getting to her. It’s been happening a lot where people miss the social intimacy of other people."
relationship_advice,fqi0sft,t3_gj1rfi,1589387879.0,"This really worries me.

Do you have someplace else you can stay? I know with quarantine it’s pretty difficult right now but if there is a place you can stay other than your house I suggest doing that. Possibly with your dad? 

What your mother is doing isn’t okay. Crossing boundaries like that isn’t okay in any sense of the word. It’s not a love language thing or just give her more hugs. She shouldn’t be saying you’re my son I can do whatever I want. That’s what abusers say to their victims. I don’t want to say that’s what your mom is but I’m not going to say that it isn’t a red flag. 

I have a long history of abusive relationships and those words are usually used when there is a lack of control for the abuser and the need to regain dominance. 

Just as a precaution try going to stay with your dad till the end of quarantine. And tell him about everything that is going on. Your feelings are valid and what she is doing is invalidating them."

AmItheAsshole,fq5yxpd,t1_fq5fcmo,1589120909.0,"There is a HUGE issue that the trans community have unknowingly placed on themselves.

A lot of newly transitioning people have a hard time coming into the trans community, ESPECIALLY with the older ages. 

Some people project their self hatred onto others and if they see something that reminds them of how they dislike themselves or their community, so ensues gatekeeping. And I’m saying people because this doesn’t just lie with trans folk. So in the case of Taylor. He may like his name just the way it is. But to a  trans person, along with cis people, they may see it as “you are not conforming to my idea of a trans person” therefore you are not allowed to be trans. 

Taylor is defying the cookie cutter standard of a trans persons journey. And for some ungodly reason, his trans and cis friends are not here for it. 

“Everyone has a different journey. Mine is not the same as some else’s.” This is something that is more or less said by trans folk. It means not to judge another’s life or steps."

Only because, from your description, your parents are most occupied with Jess, and seem to consider adopting her a gesture of kindness. Adopting a person is not a gesture of kindness or rescue or project. It is really frustrating for me, an adopted person, to look at your parents in a good light because of how you describe them. 
For you, you are very much projecting your frustrations with your parents onto Jess. Jess has got some stuff to work through, and that can only happen with therapy and possibly medication. Trauma is a hard thing and PTSD is even more complicated. I still get flash backs and it freaks me out, it’s been 5 years. Maybe get some therapy for yourself.

This is a really big deal right now and everyone is talking about it on the Nextdoor app. 
It really is the issue of what they are bringing to the town. Some people understand the “it’s their home they should be able to come back regardless” but I really stand on the side of “don’t come here, wait it out where you are”
NBPT has a large population of young families and older retired people. I see kids around my street and downtown all the time. Everyone, so far that I’ve met, really care about each other. 
I live by myself but I do worry about the couple that lives upstairs from me, they have a new born. I worry about the older couples that live next door, at the end of my street and at the top of my street. And most of all I worry about the 6 kids that would play with each other on my street. 
There is a housing authority near me and there are always elderly people going in an out in their walkers and wheel chairs. I’ve made friends with some of them from walking my dogs all the time. 
It’s just very risky to come from a hot spot to a town like ours. We wouldn’t fair well, even with a minor outbreak. Sadly many of the older people and younger also don’t wear masks. It’s been very hard to get people to wear them here."

after reading all the comments and your own responses, I think the general consensus is for you to get your own lawyer that will only be backing you and have your best interests at heart, fight for full custody (that way you have control over when your ex will have visiting time), do not let him near the birthing room or the birth certificate, and minimize contact with them until after the private birth. 

I saw my brother go through a battle like this and let me tell you it was a godsend when he got full custody. My nephews mother was trying to convince her son that her new boyfriend was his real dad. It was horrifying. This is your child. You have decided to keep this kid. It is your duty to make sure this baby is raised in a healthy space, not where some ex and woman thinks that they can just slap a dead kids name on your kid and call it theirs. You are not a surrogate. You have a say over your body and your baby.

Edit/add-on
Keep all text messages and Facebook receipts. Screenshot everything. This may help you with custody. My brother was a single dad and still got full custody, it is completely possible. You are the mother. You have that on your side."

MyChemicalRomance,fg5334f,t3_ewt4lo,1580517074.0,"Yo like this is so fucked up. My coworker was BRAGGING about how her friends buy a bunch of tickets for MCR and SCALP/RESELL them for like 600$. 

I looked at her in the face and said “no. That is horrible. I can’t believe you think that’s okay. Shame! SHAME ON YOU! That is NO WAY to be making money. How dare you AND YOUR FRIENDS think that is okay?! Horrible ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE. SHAME. SHAME ON YOU” 

She didn’t talk to me for the rest of the shift. I can’t stand her. Horrible. Shame."

Having your own space is awesome.

If she shows resistance, just gently remind her that you both are your own people and that she may recharge by being around people and socializing but that you may recharge by having personal time alone. Everyone is different and she should be able to respect you and your choices."
relationship_advice,ffp9a7j,t1_ffp95wy,1580089374.0,Omg that is perfect. He reads like a mad man and would totally find this helpful. Thank you SO much!
relationship_advice,ffp94tg,t1_ffp8kb5,1580089273.0,"OH WOW! That is a GREAT conversation starter! He and I both LOVE to talk about different perspectives on people and cultures and words in general and how somethings are perceived! I’m pretty sure he won’t feel attacked but will want to understand why it’s not the best word to use when fawning over me. 

He is in fact very shy and grew up in kind of a small community and continues to find different cultures and people “exotic”. I’ll def bring up some of the points you made. Thank you so much for responding. This was very well thought out and written :)"
