A lot of people say weighted blankets help with anxiety and the need of physical touch. I have a huge one for when I get flash backs and what not. You can get some that are relatively cheap and come in different weights. Also there are different self holding the techniques that help. Like a palm on the forehead and the other palm on the upper stomach area with light pressure. Maybe when you initiate the hug have a blanket with you so you can wrap her up and the slight pressure and weight will be there when you end the hug. There are a lot of tools out there that can help with her lack of physical touch. 

Setting boundaries is still a thing. Keep trying those in conjunction with the above. Hopefully it‚Äôs just the quarantine things getting to her. It‚Äôs been happening a lot where people miss the social intimacy of other people."

Do you have someplace else you can stay? I know with quarantine it‚Äôs pretty difficult right now but if there is a place you can stay other than your house I suggest doing that. Possibly with your dad? 

What your mother is doing isn‚Äôt okay. Crossing boundaries like that isn‚Äôt okay in any sense of the word. It‚Äôs not a love language thing or just give her more hugs. She shouldn‚Äôt be saying you‚Äôre my son I can do whatever I want. That‚Äôs what abusers say to their victims. I don‚Äôt want to say that‚Äôs what your mom is but I‚Äôm not going to say that it isn‚Äôt a red flag. 

I have a long history of abusive relationships and those words are usually used when there is a lack of control for the abuser and the need to regain dominance. 

Just as a precaution try going to stay with your dad till the end of quarantine. And tell him about everything that is going on. Your feelings are valid and what she is doing is invalidating them."

Taylor is defying the cookie cutter standard of a trans persons journey. And for some ungodly reason, his trans and cis friends are not here for it.

Only because, from your description, your parents are most occupied with Jess, and seem to consider adopting her a gesture of kindness. Adopting a person is not a gesture of kindness or rescue or project. It is really frustrating for me, an adopted person, to look at your parents in a good light because of how you describe them. 
For you, you are very much projecting your frustrations with your parents onto Jess. Jess has got some stuff to work through, and that can only happen with therapy and possibly medication. Trauma is a hard thing and PTSD is even more complicated. I still get flash backs and it freaks me out, it‚Äôs been 5 years. Maybe get some therapy for yourself.

after reading all the comments and your own responses, I think the general consensus is for you to get your own lawyer that will only be backing you and have your best interests at heart, fight for full custody (that way you have control over when your ex will have visiting time), do not let him near the birthing room or the birth certificate, and minimize contact with them until after the private birth. 

I saw my brother go through a battle like this and let me tell you it was a godsend when he got full custody. My nephews mother was trying to convince her son that her new boyfriend was his real dad. It was horrifying. This is your child. You have decided to keep this kid. It is your duty to make sure this baby is raised in a healthy space, not where some ex and woman thinks that they can just slap a dead kids name on your kid and call it theirs. You are not a surrogate. You have a say over your body and your baby.

Edit/add-on
Keep all text messages and Facebook receipts. Screenshot everything. This may help you with custody. My brother was a single dad and still got full custody, it is completely possible. You are the mother. You have that on your side."

I would never in my life ever think to leave my family for my bio family. And my family was not rich or in anyway wealthy. One of parents was extremely sick by the time I graduated high school. I stuck by because no one, and I knew no one could replace them or give me the same amount of love that they gave to me. I could never think of it. 

He‚Äôs 14. He may know what he wants right now, but in the future? Idk. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm suggesting therapy. This is too much to unpack with random people. You need a professional."
AskReddit,fgyvr94,t1_fgyj45t,1581187739.0,"I am not a singer, but oh my god I do some of this when I‚Äôm singing on the way home from work. I sing for about an hour straight and really focus on my breathing and how my diaphragm expands and contracts. I really didn‚Äôt know that this was helping me sing for longer, it just felt more comfortable to me . 

I sing as form of therapy. Helps with work stress."

I am so so proud of you. This must have been a hard decision but you knew when something wasn‚Äôt right. You made the healthiest decision and the safest one to boot. 

This is very big step into the long road of recovery and management of your illness. You took the first step forward. Again so proud of you. Big hugs. üíï"

I looked at her in the face and said ‚Äúno. That is horrible. I can‚Äôt believe you think that‚Äôs okay. Shame! SHAME ON YOU! That is NO WAY to be making money. How dare you AND YOUR FRIENDS think that is okay?! Horrible ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE. SHAME. SHAME ON YOU‚Äù

Having your own space is awesome.

If she shows resistance, just gently remind her that you both are your own people and that she may recharge by being around people and socializing but that you may recharge by having personal time alone. Everyone is different and she should be able to respect you and your choices."

He and I both LOVE to talk about different perspectives on people and cultures and words in general and how somethings are perceived! I‚Äôm pretty sure he won‚Äôt feel attacked but will want to understand why it‚Äôs not the best word to use when fawning over me. 

He is in fact very shy and grew up in kind of a small community and continues to find different cultures and people ‚Äúexotic‚Äù. I‚Äôll def bring up some of the points you made. Thank you so much for responding. This was very well thought out and written :)"
