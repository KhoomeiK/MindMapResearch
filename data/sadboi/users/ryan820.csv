In essence... take care of yourself.  Mentally and physically but also ethically and morally.  Life is so full of distractions, good and bad, and in the end we have to be vigilant against losing sight of who you are as a person.

The Man in the Glass

Dale Wimbrow Sr

 When you get what you want in your struggle for self  
And the world makes you king for a day  
Just go to the mirror and look at yourself  
And see what that man has to say.  


For it isn‚Äôt your father, or mother, or wife   
Whose judgment upon you must pass  
The fellow whose verdict counts most in your life  
Is the one staring back from the glass.  


He‚Äôs the fellow to please ‚Äì never mind all the rest  
For he‚Äôs with you, clear to the end  
And you‚Äôve passed your most difficult, dangerous test  
If the man in the glass is your friend.  


You may fool the whole world down the pathway of years  
And get pats on the back as you pass  
But your final reward will be heartache and tears  
If you‚Äôve cheated the man in the glass."

I have a 12.9‚Äù and it is my absolute favorite tech.  I used it for literally everything, including in my work flow, but it still lacks some of the smoothness that comes with the MacOS and other things like a mouse etc.  

I use the Logitech keyboard/case with mine, though, and it is fantastic.  I can see how the new magic keyboard is well-received just now especially with its trackpad.

The alternator failed and the battery had issues as well and discharged super fast. I was able to turn on pilot controlled lighting but about 200 feet above the ground on short final and with now no power and thus no radios the pilot controlled lighting for the runway turned off/timed out. I thankfully had my instructor with me and she had a small flash light on the steam gauges and I was able to fly it down based on pitch, speed and descent rate locked in. Jammed on the brakes hard to stop as soon as possible. We stopped safely on the runway and suddenly the lights went on for runway. Another pilot had arrived to land. We taxied clear in time but that was really scary. 

We contacted ATC to let them know what happened and where we are. We got our battery charged and and started up and things were working fine again- the alt was working etc. 

Five minutes out from class C airspace we lose power again. I literally got clearance to land from ATC over my cell phone. 

We did squawk radio out transponder before entering class c but I had my clearance already. Thankfully the class c airport was fully light and I landed just fine.

Because I was in a job I hated working for a company that I once idolized and revered. I was working for a boss who would never let me advance (I applied for positions and even got them only to be told I was too imperative to my current role) and I saw no future there as leadership made one ethical debacle after another. 

I left that job in November. 

I have a new job and I work from home full time. A rarity, I know. I don‚Äôt even like this job but you can put up with a lot of shit in the comfort of your own home and the ability to just turn things off. 

I also did something back in the summer of 2017 that set this all in motion. My wife asked me, hey, do you think we can cut our costs as much as possible, save like hell, invest and pay off all debt...like super fast?  Retire early? I wasn‚Äôt sure but I said let‚Äôs try and it worked. I mean we are still saving like hell but we paid off our house and carry no debt. We are both working from home. I do my job and make sure my clients are happy. Life is good for me. 

However, there is more to this story. I allowed myself to sort of self destruct over the years. I worked very very hard, stressed over the shit men stress over - being an awesome husband and dad, great at providing, work being a huge part of my life to the point that it began to define me. I was tired, emotionally and physically. My health, while I was cardiovascular healthy, was crap because my stress was off the charts and I was stuck in the grind. Up at 445AM, work out, shower, drive to work, online by 6AM to talk to Europe, at the office late to talk to Asia. 

W T F. 

I couldn‚Äôt do it. So I changed everything. I am now focused on making sure I‚Äôm financially independent. I left my toxic job (that I told myself I loved) for a job that is remote but fits the bill. I do what I want when I want. I have no debt. I don‚Äôt do the rat race any more. Fuck that shit. 

I recognize that I‚Äôm saying this all while other responders here are out of work and many may even be facing really tough times. It sucks and I know it because I have been there before (layoffs, staff reductions...I‚Äôve been there). Hell, I found out I‚Äôd be a dad the same day I was let go from my job at the time. Fun times. 

But I used all of those experiences to harden my will to control my life (within reason as you can‚Äôt control everything). I have a friend who is furloughed from my old company who talks with me almost daily now, asking me what I did. None of it is a secret. Decide what you want and adjust your behavior to match that goal. It‚Äôs hard to do and yes it can seem unachievable but it is. 

I should also mention, don‚Äôt lose this chance to also slow down and take time to reflect. In fact, this single thing might be the catalyst one needs to gain control of their new normal."
GoodNotes,fovdln3,t3_g9stj1,1588099544.0,Mine is simple... slow down.  Going slower allows me to be more deliberate.  I also make sure to check my form and how I'm holding the apple pencil.  It's a tool I'm just not  used to and so I have to make sure I'm holding it so it's comfortable.
AskReddit,fov498x,t3_g9ml8q,1588095131.0,"Mine is ‚ÄúThe Port Key.‚Äù 

I thought I was clever. I‚Äôm not."
Bonsai,fov42hp,t1_fouq5zk,1588095044.0,Yeah that‚Äôs typical. Basically one needs to take the range of conditions and half it or even more. We basically have a small sliver of hospitable conditions here in Colorado. Lol.
Bonsai,foulw78,t1_foubbfd,1588086438.0,"LOL Yeah... gardening of any type here is a challenge.  For Colorado, I bump up some of the more water retentive soil components that people in other places that actually get rain wouldn't add just to help the roots handle our intense dry air.  I also up my shade cloth, more so than our low-lander brethren.  A 50% shade cloth here is a 20 or 30% most other places.  

Good thing is, our sun is INSANE.  I can achieve very small needles/candles on pines and VERY small leaves on deciduous like maples and elms (maples are super hard to keep nice here, though)."
Bonsai,fou0pkc,t3_g9eewf,1588072736.0,I live in Colorado and not really in the mountains and my GOD it is nearly impossible to grow moss here. Of the natural moss I can find it is very limited and honestly I can‚Äôt bring myself to disrupt the delicate semi arid environment knowing it‚Äôll be a decade before it grows back!  Thankfully I do have volunteer moss from time to time in my greenhouse but it rarely lives outside during the season. I‚Äôd love a bag of moss like this!
projectmanagement,fou085m,t3_g9ho4v,1588072293.0,"I get it and your feelings, they feel awfully true to you just now and that‚Äôs okay. I‚Äôm here to say your feelings, while they matter, are quite likely not very accurate. 

Also, don‚Äôt let anyone make you feel anything. YOU decide how you feel. Just yesterday I finished a proposal, which I have NEVER done before in my old jobs, and had put dollar and hour estimates together based on numbers my team gave me and they were all wrong. What did I do?  I plugged them in thinking these super smart people had their shit together. NO! They did not. My boss called me out on the mistakes in front of everyone. At first I felt really stupid and foolish and I felt like he was doing this against me. Maybe he was...I don‚Äôt care. The fact is, yes, I should have doubled checked everyone‚Äôs math and it was my mistake but I don‚Äôt need to let myself feel like a fool...I made a simple mistake and nothing got damaged and I fixed it anyway. My point is, we are called to get a project done and sometimes that‚Äôs silly stupid stuff like making sure your people know that their math sucks and they should double check but said nicer. Lol. Also it means that I could just thank my boss for catching the mistake and just be better next time (in my defense, my boss will find fault with literally everything I do). I work with some very bright and sharp people and that‚Äôs all great but deep down I know things would become very rocky if I didn‚Äôt do my job and that‚Äôs important. 

Only let you decide how you feel. 

Also, consider having a crucial conversation with those who actively do things that are upsetting to you after you‚Äôve nailed down why it upsets you (to make sure you‚Äôre not making something out of nothing). There is a very real thing called Crucial Conversations please look it up. It really helped me effectively communicate when things get too personal or emotional and bring it back to professional and constructive."

Denver,fomukum,t3_g8aojw,1587904310.0,"I know this doesn‚Äôt help your wife but I for one refuse to allow people to be dicks to our grocers etc. maybe I‚Äôm inviting more trouble than it is worth but I tore in to a jerk at the store a few weeks back who decided she had the right to have adult tantrum in the store. It is amazing how quickly people, even adults, will snap out of it. Yes it requires someone to correct that behavior and most would not but I‚Äôll not stand by while some hard working person gets berated for things outside their control."

UlcerativeColitis,fo6p9fn,t1_fo6ndtu,1587564039.0,Thank you and I hope you‚Äôre doing well!  I was diagnosed back in 2004 so I‚Äôve been dealing with this condition for quite some time. That said my case has been specific and localized to two areas and for the most part I‚Äôve done well. The issue is that as you get older it gets difficult to control and you increase your chances of cancer etc. I‚Äôll be okay and thankfully I have a doctor who is forward thinking and making sure I have all the info to make a good decision.
