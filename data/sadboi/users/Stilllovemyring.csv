What you describe does not really resonate with my experience. Normally, for myself and the other people with bipolar who I have met, bipolar disorder means having both mania/hypomania and depression. The exception is that people who experience mania and no depression are diagnosed bipolar 1. Mania involves losing touch with reality, scary wild decisions, overwhelming racing thoughts, extreme anger, and other serious life disrupting symptoms. It is not unusual for manic people to be hospitalized.

In her youth she was an explosive personality known for making huge scenes when she was upset, preferably in public. She would undress at the slightest provocation. She wore a totally sheer dress to my mother’s wedding. We have someone chaperone her and choose her outfits for all family events. 

She is also a compulsive liar and exaggerates all her stories.
