You are walking on eggshells waiting for the next ball smack. This will cause PTSD as you are needing to ALWAYS be alert. It freaking hurts and is psychologically stressful to always be wondering when the next attack will come. You in no uncertain terms asked her to stop. You said you would leave. If you do not leave she will learn to do whatever she wants with boundaries. There is NO TWO WEEKS. She does not need time to break a fucking habit.  Print all this. Pack a bag. When she does it again leave. Do not respond to her love bombing or text threats once you leave. Good god man.

iamatotalpieceofshit,fpv0ebl,t1_fptqr6d,1588930301.0,these are the people that have the country held hostage politically... unfortunately to 65% of us held hostage are not the revolution type because it is not them that should be revolting it is us.  Covid is also a fascist dream to curb descent.
iamatotalpieceofshit,fpv08js,t1_fpu4o57,1588930131.0,People where I grew up in rural America think every Mexican is trying to cross the border... like every single person that lives in Mexico.  They have no concept of Mexico city being an international city or many parts of Mexico being safe or that anyone in Mexico works for Pay Pal or went to college.   I have a few open minded ones that I got passports and took to Tulum and other parts of Mexico and they are blown away.  Most won't go because they think they will get killed.

My rural family and high school friends have changed over the last couple of decades (with the NRA and Fox messaging) from having guns for hunting etc to having these guns around and be very ""anxious"" to use them. They day dream of the intruder, of a citizen arrest and civil war.  Each of them is like their own military industrial complex where they have invested so much into this gun culture that they are itching to use them.  These two remind me of that, the whole citizen arrest etc.  This is why the proliferation is bad, just more chance of a gun used like this, a wife getting shot, suicide.  My dad on the other hand has about 75 guns on his farm.  No assualt weapons, no glocks etc.  You never see his guns and he never talks about them.  aka: responsible dem gun owner like most people were 30 years ago.  You have in these two the combination of racism, gun worship and a pent up demand to use the guns."

You can literally cause the entire thing to happen, then say some BS that your were attacked.  Any reasonable person knows that defies common sense yet here we are.  It may not work but it is muddled enough that they are going to at least be able to make a defense of it or get it to manslaughter because they never intended to kill him just be good ole boys and arrest him for black."
