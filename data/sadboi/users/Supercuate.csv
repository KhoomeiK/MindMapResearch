Hi OP, hope you don\`t mind I\`m here to respectfully disagree with some of your points. You have good sentiment, wrong approach in my opinion. Addiction is a sickness that, if not treated properly, it will kill you. Addiction is so insidious that you can ""recover"" from cocaine and never touch it again, but 10 years down the line without being careful, surprise! you are an alcoholic. I think addicts are addicted to addictions (at least I am) and there are no benefits at all. Getting sober and the path to recovery is a never-ending job, incredibly risky, you build and build for years and in 1 second everything can be demolished by 1 decision. 

Grateful? yes. I can agree that the ones that show you the path to recovery, ""recovered addicts"", are the wisest people. Even though most of them are dead or relapsed or fu\*\*\*\* up. I am grateful for their insights and wisdom, I’ve been given very useful tools to get my shit together. 

Resilience you say? well, not everyone is capable of being resilient for a number of reasons. The people that don\`t have rock bottoms and go straight to the dying part. Zero resilience. Maybe some sort of resourcefulness, because It is really hard to be a street junkie and still get you fix every day. 

You speak of the ""the void of purpose"" that God fills in for you, because no amount of drugs, money and/or whatever, will never fill. Today for you It is God. And that\`s cool. 

I think ""the lack of purpose"" or the ""crisis of existence"" is part of the human condition, you need to Own It and find yourself worthy goals to meet the purpose you give yourself, and never lose focus, because you will. Many days your addicted insidious brain will shatter god, or whatever purpose you gave yourself at that time, it needs to be solid enough to deal with that crisis. And the question down the line will be ""Is it worth it to get high to deal with this or I better not because my purpose is \*whatever gives you purpose\* \*God\*"", the decision balance should always tip to a worthy goal you give yourself. 

You need to understand that, down the line, when you have a couple of years sober on your back, it is a very lonely path. In that loneliness you need to find solitude, in solitude you need to learn to be happy with yourself. This is my speck of wisdom to you. 

Humble you say? It’s debatable. I did not feel humble when I stopped doing coke or drinking I have been fighting addictions since I was 18, I\`m 36 now, married, my wife is pregnant with my first child, hopefully a boy :p, expected month: October. Today we are moving to a bigger place. We have a good life, stable jobs, health, we are happy. I don\`t feel humble, I feel like a boss. What can kill me, wont. It doesn't humble me, I feel proud.

Hope you are well,

Keep up the awesome work. I got into DCS when I got my Rift S 6 months ago and I was blown away instantly. I felt vertigo and adrenaline when taking off, which Im kind of addicted to, I have never felt and had the experiences DCS VR provides. Particularly on DDCS server multiplayer, there is nothing that comes close to it.

In order to show my continuous support I bought everything you have to offer and I will continue to do so, because I want to give you money so you can keep on rolling, even though there are many modules I will probably never fully learn, but fly occasionally just for the heck of it, like the I-6 or yak 52. 

The experience is always mind blowing. Again, nothing comes close to the immersion I get. I want to say thank you for that, DCS VR takes me to the places I need to be after daily responsibilities, I think DCS is going to be a part of my life and hopefully my son\`s one day, when he is old enough to get the VR headset on and maybe fly formation or do Tomcat Ops, Pilot and Rio. I know we will connect in ways that no other medium can provide.

I am particularity interested on the Vulcan API integration (for VR performance) and thank you for this status report. I hope you get a hang on the spaghetti code. 

To the Community,

I understand the rage & frustration bros. It is not in our interest to demoralize and hate on the dev team, the efficient way to communicate issues and feedback is by using the official channels. 

We are all on an Open Beta, we all know and accept the risks that rolling onto OB implies. We need to take ownership of the risks we take. It sucks of course, but we accepted those risks. Its our responsibility to own them and roll back or wait.  

This is a niche very smart community, DCS is not for everyone. It\`s a really special thing and part of our lives. 

Thanks for Reading.

Best Regards,
