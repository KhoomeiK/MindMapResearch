Anxiety,fcr1mxy,t1_fcqhwvb,1577895457.0,"Excellent, OP! 
And remember, even if you had had a panic attack, it was still a victory because you did it. Keep winning!"

Anxiety,fc6yiz7,t3_egdenq,1577492799.0,"Not a doctor, but some of these sound similar to me and is a combination of continued low level anxiety symptoms after a rough day or panic attack and some depression. In my case, the  anxiety usually brings about the depression (cyclical for being depressed about being anxious).

I’ve gotten much better over the past few years at understanding how it's affecting me and interrupt the cycle. Have to make real effort to change the routine (RUT) that brought it about in the first place. Eat better, exercise, journaling, focusing on happy hobbies, and spending time with others."
Anxiety,fbytjo3,t3_ef2u2x,1577225941.0,I have blasted could have been me by the struts when attempting to do something that makes me anxious. I just love the chorus to pump me up as a reminder to do what I am doing. For healing and to learn to do more and enjoy my life

Anxiety,fbyq8on,t3_ef3vhg,1577223465.0,"Excellent work, OP. Be sure to note every win you experience so you have concrete evidence to refer back to when you migh worry about what if’s. Telling yourself that you are excited rather than anxious or afraid is a great subtle tweak to lessen the reactions or fighting your symptoms. In my few years of therapy, I have learned that I have a worried/negative outlook and tend to make anxiety a self fulfilling prophecy. Saying yes, and then doing it are amazing steps in the right direction. 

You either win, or you learn when it comes to taking your life back from anxiety. BRAVO AND ENCORE"
Anxiety,fbypvpo,t3_ef57tf,1577223199.0,"Remember, everyone, even non anxious people has dark or strange thoughts. Learning recently, it’s about how you respond to them. If you react fearfully, they carry weight and will continue to bring anxiety.

The recommendation was to chase those thoughts. MAKE them stay with you, and potentially even turn them around. (Think Ridukulus from Harry Potter). It’s a way for you to take control of the thought processes. It was covered in a later chapter of DARE by Barry McDonagh. Worth a read or a listen if on audible."
Anxiety,fbyjray,t1_fbwbc1u,1577218662.0,"OP, just out of curiosity, what sort of effect did 2 or 3 mg have? I had a part time script for .25 when I finally decided I was willing to go with chemical help. Last year, new doc upped it to .5 that I still only take on days I anticipate higher levels or if I’m already struggling. But even this amount has me feel pretty sleepy. How did the larger dose affect you? Did you to sleep pretty hard after usage?"
Anxiety,fbtg42r,t1_fbtbhpa,1577077676.0,"For sure, if you can or are willing to afford it for the annual cost, Headspace is a great app.

I also have been working through the tools taught by the DARE process from Barry McDonagh. Getting the short book on audible and going through it a few times this year as a refresher has helped healing"
Anxiety,fbtf94p,t3_eedk4o,1577076875.0,"I have had some decent results over the years with venting exercises. The way I understood the teachings was that just voicing things out loud and making your brain hear it's own thoughts and worries can lessen their effects.

Directions stated to spend 7-10 timed minutes in front of a mirror and just voice anything that is worrying you or what you are afraid of. Doesnt matter how off the wall unlikely or even repeating yourself. Once completed, be sure to take another handful of minutes to mindfully breathe to re-center yourself.

It's all good news and success is happening"
