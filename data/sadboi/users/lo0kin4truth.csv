To cut to the chase, I think that you honestly have no obligation to take up the role of caretaker for your brother. It sounds like your mom is in over her head with taking care of him (for him to abuse her and get away with that is verrrrry bad). Has she ever considered looking for help, in therapy or assistants? Like I think there are people who would be able to step in and do some Mary Poppins-esque magic in the way of helping him learn and adapt so that he can be more independent. And more importantly, can find a positive way to redirect his anger.

Dissociation,fr3ybhc,t1_fr2l11x,1589869793.0,"To me it sounds more like you are not going to allow others to have the opportunity to help. One post I read I had a very strong sense that you have a belief that *you* have to get yourself out of this “rut”, and since it’s just a “rut”, you should be able to do that. But after more than a year of this same experience and not making strides by yourself, you’re realizing that that belief was incorrect. And maybe you still feel like you *should* be able to get out of the rut... but because you’re not, there’s clearly something wrong with you, or your worth is low, or something to that regard. 

Maybe posting the vents to see a bunch of people saying things to support you is a way for you to say that you at least “tried to get help” but it didn’t work. And since you tried to help yourself and didn’t succeed in the past year, and now that you’re reaching out and no one is saying what you want them to say / maybe you’re not accepting the help, that validates your feeling that there’s nothing to be done in your situation.

Just re reading the mom paragraph and I understand why it would still be hard to talk with her since she seems to relive her trauma with you in the room pretty often.

> you can’t make anyone understand if they don’t want to try

You nailed this one. It sounds like you are going through a huge ordeal just to explain your side of things and he just has a mirror held up, deflecting your concerns back to you as *your* problems. He does not sound worthy to date a person as thoughtful and intelligent and patient as you. It is so clear to see that you are very talented and strong and confident *outside* of your relationship to him. I think it’s just a matter of building yourself back up, and giving yourself many many reminders that who he tries to portray you as is not an accurate representation by ANY means.

You know so much about all the reasons why he has stopped being a good boyfriend to you. It’s clear that you are convinced of that, at least that you are when you revisit this post. But there’s discrepancy between what you seem to dislike about him and the relationship  and what you believe you have power to do. 

I’d like to posit a question - if your younger sibling, or good friend, or even just your past self was in your same exact position, how would you feel? What would you say, how would you advise them in this situation? *We accept the love we think we deserve.* What if you deserved *just as much* as your favorite person, or as much as your younger self?

Like, I flunked out of college after being a straight a student in high school. Felt like a total failure. Half a year later, I saw a post here about a bipolar individual who was also struggling in college, but was getting C’s and B’s and they were proud of that.

Well, there are *many* bipolar men out there who are as active about bettering themselves as you are. I understand you have a close bond with your boyfriend. However, you are right to read these signs as reasons for incompatibility. 

I am dating someone ten years older than me. He looks good on paper, but what really matters is that he’s made me a better communicator, more honest, and that I feel like there’s a possibility we’re ground in the same direction. 

To me, it sounds like you are dating a 19-year-old who has twenty years of life experience on you. And right now you are probably being the mom figure in this relationship. 

I think the thing I always ask myself when I have doubts about my relationship is... would I be happy if my little sister were in my position? 

It just sounds to me like not only are you moving nowhere as a couple, but he is stunting your growth. 

Do you live with him? Could you move out?

Edit: I will also say that I’ve never been able to keep a relationship with someone who was as unstable as I was. I’m super avoidant and being with a person who is actually secure in relationships has helped me tremendously.

autism,fm3r3e4,t1_fm1wd09,1585733811.0,"This makes me think of my own parents... not in a positive way. They are good people, but suck at communication and all things related to mental health.

I’m nt, my brother is autistic.

He was raised in a household where he *had* to wear those scratchy shirts, even though he “threw a fit” over it. 

I remember mimicking his stimming behaviors, like rocking back and forth on my feet while moving my arms in the opposite direction. My parents would always tell me to stop doing it, especially when we were in public. I assume they did the same with my brother.

He was put in a speech class in elementary where he apparently did nothing, and should have been in counseling. He was always bullied but my parents never openly talked about that with us kids. 

Video games were his first love, and at 23 years old, he’s facing persecution for still being so into them. 

My dad would give him big reading assignments during the summer. Theological and big-wordy books no elementary or junior high kid should have been forced to read. In how my dad treated him, like he was a project to be fixed, he became estranged from us, his siblings, even more so than before. 

We couldn’t even talk about it. Honestly we didn’t even know any of it was bad, really. We had no power, we had never been shown how to communicate, except in movies which were clearly fantasy because no child could have an adult conversation with their parents.

We teased him too, of course. I took advantage of how easily scared, jumpy, and ticklish he was, downplayed his hurt and outpourings of his heart. Maybe because that’s what I saw my parents and older siblings do. 

I learned through looking through his emails that years before, he had very nearly jumped off our roof multiple times to kill himself, when he was still in junior high. Later, when my dad read my diary that revealed these findings, he explained that he had convinced my brother that he didn’t really want to do it. That he was being selfish. That everyone goes through that and he just had to talk him out of it. I was the one who had to tell my youngest sibling of the finding, and she cried just as I had. 

Despite all this, I wouldn’t have joined this subreddit had I not met my boyfriend, a full-fledged aspie. Meeting him a year ago, I was shocked that he could just choose to wear comfortable shirts and comfortable jeans, and that his parents didn’t heed any mind when, on my first time meeting them, he went to the bathroom for ten minutes before coming out to greet anyone. His friends don’t make fun of him for acting goofy in the living room or playing too many video games. They always make sure to cater to his food preferences when he’s over. 

This was very long and maybe not welcome... but, please, please. Do *not* be my parents with your autistic children."

aspergers_dating,flj8jrz,t3_fosjmb,1585202465.0,"Hi! NT female dating aspie male for over a year.

A LOT of this resonates with me. Especially how your husband is so fond of carbs and oily foods and won’t add greens to the diet even if it’s good for him and you want more variety. 

I completely understand the desire to want to change his habits and the frustration that he doesn’t care and won’t budge. I don’t think that’s bad for you to be upset about. But despite how frustrating it is that his desire for variety is 0 and yours is much greater than that, I do agree that it’s unfair for him to expect that he will change now that he’s home more often. 

I don’t live with my boyfriend, but I’ve anticipated how it would be food wise... I gain weight every weekend I see him, so if we were together long term I would be ADAMANT that I eat and prepare my own meals myself. I like variety and salads as well, so I would need to have a conversation with him to let him know that I’m not going to eat out every day or eat the pizza with him if he orders one. That might be a good strategy for you to take since it will reduce your personal investment in what foods *he* eats when your meals are cooked by you. 

Is part of the issue that he is the one preparing all the meals, so he won’t cook food that you want when he’s also eating it?

I think other positive benefits for this plan is that if you eat healthily with variety on your own, there might be a day a few months down the road that he shows interest in how you’re preparing a specific meal. And maybe he might let you have him help make it. And maybe that one meal will eventually make its way onto his list of go-to’s. A lot of maybes, so don’t think this is very likely to happen :)

For my guy the one time I ever saw him add a meal variety that was actually green and healthy was after he made a trip to see family, and his brother - in - law showed him and had him help cook an incredibly simple three-ingredient veggie stir. Then he sent him home with a recipe and instructions, and because it was shown to him and it was very simple and it seems like it was just a positive experience for him, he immediately got the ingredients and made it multiple times.

Personally I’ve only done therapy through BetterHelp and I found it very useful, though I haven’t used it since December due to financial reasons.

aspergers_dating,flhcxbj,t3_forlt2,1585160333.0,"Hi, thank you for making this post! It makes me happy to see how excited and happy you are about dating him, and that your excited energy is going towards learning about him and preparing yourself for what to expect. 

I’ve dated an aspie guy for over a year. Here are some things that are different about dating him versus most neurotypicals:

**Honesty**
- As you commented, he is very honest. If I ask him what he thinks about something, I don’t have to worry about if he’s covering the truth. It’s easy to keep track of what he likes or doesn’t like because he unabashedly shares it or reacts negatively. 
- The downside of this extends to when you’re trying to look nice for him and ask him what he thinks of a dress. If he doesn’t like how it looks, he’ll blatantly say it, most of the time without giving any kind of reassuring “But *you* look pretty.”

**Routine**
- Get used to it! More than 95% of our hangouts have the same shape or pattern - I come over, he tells me what work he still needs to get done, we plan around that and figure out food, then we decide on activity (video game or tv show or maybe shopping), and generally we transition to the bedroom by that point. Sometimes the bedroom time will happen much earlier if we haven’t seen each other for a while, but even then, he really likes figuring out a schedule as soon as it’s over. 
- Plus side, I don’t have to worry about being bored or doing nothing with him because he tries to schedule for maximized togetherness. 
- Downside is I’m generally the person to decide on spontaneous activities and it’s hard for him to be excited about those because they’re out of the norm
- It is also very very hard to alter his schedule even if it’s negatively affecting him and he knows it. He’s a Taurus too so very stubborn haha

**Mind Blindness**
- You May have come across this in readings already, but basically it is *not* naturally wired in an Aspie to be cognizant of others and their needs, and likewise hard to interpret social patterns and nuances of neurotypicals. My aspie has made it a hobby to learn social skills so it is clear that he makes an effort to show me interest and be aware of others because it is important to others. 
- You will know best how your guy is, but I’m sure there will come a time when he’s busy or stressed and stops asking you how your day was when you’re expecting that empathy and support. And if you’re like me, then you’ll start seeing that as a sign that he doesn’t really care about you, and become insecure, and then hide it from him since you know that he doesn’t mean to, he’s just busy. (Don’t do any of that, but that was how I responded...) which brings me to

**Communication**
- Yes, he’s honest, and yes he’ll tell you he likes you probably from day one. But neurotypicals dating culture makes us expect that he’ll continue to give us compliments, will notice when we’re feeling blue, will tell us that they like or love us when either is the case. Do *not* expect this from him. And do not expect yourself to just be okay with him not saying these things that you want to hear. I tried that for a year, didn’t work, until I finally told him that I was feeling insecure in the relationship because it didn’t feel like he was very into me. 
- PLEASE DONT MAKE THAT MISTAKE! I would advise being forthcoming with what is bothering you in the relationship, using the gift of his appeal for honesty to help you. It is legitimate that you want to hear him tell you that he likes you more often than once, and if you let him know this, he should be happy to work on this to make you happy. Likewise you should be learning (as you are) to be understanding of when he is too stressed to adhere to social cues and give him a chance to be his autistic self without judgement. It’s a balancing act :)

This is already very long but I will add one more just because it affects me as a gift-giver a lot!

**Gifts**
- My aspie very rarely likes gifts that are given to him, unless they are actually something he’ll use in his special interest category (ie hot new video games, and even then it’s a coin flip if he’ll actually show interest). What a lot of his family and friends will do is give him things that are useful for day to day life, ie clothes, but the downside is that he will seriously not remember who gave him what.
- I have avoided giving him many tangible gifts since gift giving is my love language and it is very hard to see a thing I worked hard on not be appreciated at all (which can happen lol). Instead I try to see my time with him as a gift and appease my gift giving nature by sprinkling in random things here and there that won’t be a big deal if he doesn’t use them or whatever. 


Again, this comes back to communication. If you just ask him what kinds of gifts he’s bound to like, or what his love language is, or any other number of things by just asking him. If you’re unsure of his interest, ask, and he will be honest :)"

BipolarReddit,flfz30y,t3_fobxgb,1585123597.0,"I don’t have a lot of advice for you since I am in a very similar boat. Living on my own for the first time since January, things were about to pick up with my finances... and now I’m having to apply for supermarket jobs while my roommates all are moving home to family in countries where they actually have healthcare and support.

I’m also staying up late and sleeping in late... eating way too fucking much... and every day I’m telling myself I’ll go on a walk as per my usual workout, but I always neglect it since it kind of feels like there isn’t a point. 

I’ve never been able to stick to a routine as a bipolar individual until I had to force myself to show up on time for work. Now that that’s gone, everything feels like a mess. 

I’ve been trying to balance video game stints with movie breaks and eating meals. And reddit. Really just feels like there’s nobody to keep me accountable for anything and so why bother?

siblingsupport,flfy2yj,t3_foboij,1585122411.0,"And I think I would add that in my experience with people on the spectrum, honesty is always ALWAYS the best course with them. They appreciate it immensely since their communication style is often straight-up and kind of unfiltered. So I don’t imagine your brother would feel ashamed being told to do it in private unless it was presented to him as a shameful thing"
siblingsupport,flfxwxb,t3_foboij,1585122207.0,"Hmm. So he doesn’t have a tablet or computer or phone to use for those purposes? I imagine that he is going to keep going to the computer room to do that even if you guys are explaining to him the why nots, as that is a habit for him and it doesn’t sound like he has any other visual stimulation available to him. 

Not saying that he couldn’t masturbate without visual aid, but it is probably a lot harder especially knowing that there is a computer to use just down the hall. So to him it might feel like he is being restricted from masturbation entirely since that is his routine (I’ve been dating my aspie for over a year and if there’s anything I’ve learned, it’s that he loooves routines.) 

So I guess I am on board with getting him his own tablet or computer and just initially giving him freedom with it. Not only are you giving him a private venue for meeting his sexual needs, you’re also kind of rewarding him with a bit of independence and privacy in exchange for him changing his habits. 

I think that you guys could even make the tablet more of a reward by only giving him access after certain daily things he needs to do get done. So maybe he has it through the night, but he needs to have brought it down to the living area/kitchen by breakfast time, and can only use it in public until 12... and then he needs to put it away and do his chores or etc if he wants to have it for the evening. 

This is all speculation and probably a bit hypocritical since I just moved out of a household where my parents were adamant about controlling our (mine and my autistic sibling’s) device privileges. I really don’t know what would be best for your brother since I don’t how he functions or what drives him. Maybe try cross posting to r/Aspergers or other subs?"

I am curious to hear where your parents are in this. Are they distant? Do they have traits that you sometimes make you wonder if they are abusive? My guess is that your sister has taken on this hyper-anxious relationship with you from having an emotionally distant parent, somehow finding that she was “starved”for connection and seeking that out in you. 

Perhaps you’re already aware to some extent where the behavior is coming from - but it helps to look at the “why” to see the situation from someone else’s shoes, especially when there are patterns of interaction with people you care about that you want to work to change.

Can you say more about the history of this issue? Have you ever talked to her about it before? What is your general course of action to her taking your time and energy and expressing this clinginess? Have other family members or siblings witnessed what has been happening or intervened?"

AskWomen,ffb1pp5,t1_ff8kh1q,1579749595.0,"A similar story from the other side :)

My 9th grade best friend was all about this elite small choir at our school. They were having try outs at the end of the year and even though she was a freshman and they weren’t likely to pick her, this try out and group was all she was talking about. Both of our older sisters had been in the group several years before, so I knew about it, but didn’t see myself as being very outgoing to go for the try outs.

But eventually, she convinced me to try out. She kept pushing and pushing me, and I realized that I really wanted to make it. I didn’t want to try out - that was the scary part!! - but I had always loved competitions and suddenly, this tryout had become my next target. If I made it, I’d be in the advanced choir, doing the music that I loved at a higher difficulty but with better singers. 

My best friend and I went to tryouts together. I got the dance down probably the best out of any of the 9th graders or sophomores. I smiled and sang as best I could. Though not super talented with my voice, I could always stay on pitch, and had a fine timbre for the alto notes.

So, somehow, I ended up being the only sophomore in the elite group the next year. My best friend gave me a half hearted congratulations and I really didn’t know what to say to make the situation better. As we were in different groups, I hardly saw her anymore, and when I did there was such awkward tension that made hanging out an infrequent thing. 

**TLDR;** My best friend encouraged and cajoled me into trying out for the same elite choir at our high school that she really wanted to be in. After I was selected (and she wasn’t) we drifted apart hard core."

You are probably very correct that it will become very useful to not let things build up between us (and when I say us, I mean frustrations that I have to manage on my own when I’m not communicating with him). I naturally take a lot longer to process things and react, which makes me more patient but also makes it much easier to “let things build up” until I feel so upset at actions he’s not aware of that the relationship seems fruitless.

Possibly your guy feels overwhelmed by the uncertainty of how much more you want him to express his affection. For us, he started small by just asking how my day was going. One simple step. Possibly for you guys, you could ask if he could show you one sign of affection every time you see each other for the first or last time of the day. A greeting hug and goodbye kiss for instance. That’s already twice as much affection, and it’s an easy to remember standard for him. He only has to try to be affectionate with you once more than what he is currently comfortable with."

More like, you start going down a certain calling or way of living - and many times your life gets harder. Which is all good for growth, but there have been many many many Christians who have had serious bouts of depression - just like any other group of people."
