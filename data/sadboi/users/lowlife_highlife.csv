Either she will realize how toxic her behavior, and actively make some changes to save your relationship, or this will end up causing constant fights and you will have feelings of resentment towards her. If you sit back and let her walk all over you, you will lose yourself friends and eventually lose her anyway. If she doesn’t change, there’s no saving your relationship. Behavior like this only gets worse if you don’t make a conscious effort to nip it in the bud."

""However, as part of taking extra precautions, these children will remain in self-quarantine until their parents have tested negative. At that point, they will also be tested to ensure that they remain negative. Until then they will be regarded as potentially infected. This means they will continue not attending school.

findareddit,fioel28,t3_f8u8iq,1582581721.0,"Firstly I would just like to say I am incredibly sorry for your loss. I have lost my older brother to cancer recently. 

I have a very similar situation in my family to your’s. When I was 15, I had identical twin step-sisters who were also 15. One of the girls passed away from a sudden and rare lung infection. Her twin was absolutely devastated. She also went off the rails for a bit, but eventually came back to normality with both individual and family therapy. Grief manifests in different ways and I commend you on recognizing survivor’s guilt in your son. It sounds like he is in deep at the moment, and you might need an extremely emotionally charged moment or conversation to get him to realize he is heading down the wrong path. I don’t really want to suggest an intervention, but if you show him how much his actions are hurting you, it might change his mind about what he is doing. After my brother passed away, I had drug problems and academic failings. Once I saw how much more hurt I was causing my mother (she told me this with tears in her eyes) I realized I needed to change my ways and checked in to a rehab for 3 weeks. Now, I am the one that supports her and my family through our grief process. I hope your son can make a similar turnaround to myself and my step-sister. Once again I send my condolences."
