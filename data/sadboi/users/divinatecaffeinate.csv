Not to mention all the times I surely can’t afford to “just take an uber,” getting from place to place. it sickens me thinking about the extra time i take on my daily routes avoiding sexist men, when possible. it rained a few days back, so the Stoagie Joes lechers were forced to cram themselves inside behind glass, like the zoo animals they behave like. I recently returned a mean AF gargoyle face to a crusty weirdo giving me the same look, so I guess I’ve picked up some strategies....This city’s gonna give me frown lines :["

survivorsofabuse,f329t0l,t3_df2mqz,1570598810.0,"Have you considered that different things you may be tuned into on a more basic level, maybe even elements of the background or setting, could be triggering you? This was something I realized when I felt like I was teasing out a web of recognizing different triggers while pushing myself too much and unfortunately feeling sexual pressure when triggers started really bubbling to a surface after not having previous sexual issues with my loving partner. Unfortunately I don’t think he had the maturity to make space and time while I began to understand I was being triggered just from sexual stimulation or situations, sometimes. and he was occasionally coercive about his need for more sex, made me feel I was letting him down to sometimes really freeze and not be understanding myself why or what was happening. it was a loving long term relationship but you do start to question how much someone can be an advocate for your growth and overcoming trauma and thriving when they put their want over your feeling of safety, or don’t have the capacity to hear you when you say you feel unsafe.

Edit: I guess what I’m saying is...it may be that one day you feel that your pain and the fear and anxiety involved in existing as a survivor means you are a more mature and sensitive partner, and you likely need a mature person yourself. But it’s important to remind yourself you deserve a mature, giving, sensitive partner, too. And it’s so much work or can feel like just too much homework at times, too, but we also have do things like try and learn to be gentle accepting parents with ourselves, just as well. I’ve found that yeah, therapy is the big first part of that, and try speaking to yourself with compassion when possible. It’s hard because I struggle with self-loathing to the point I know it’s tied in with feeling no confidence and lots of fear in the, ya know, outside social world."

adultsurvivors,es8glg4,t1_es4fv29,1561697197.0,"Hey, I just want to say I’ve lived these exact moments in my head during sexual moments and voiced these thoughts that you do anxiously and angrily. I’m no longer in the same relationship where this was happening to me, and ultimately I had to decide that even if my boyfriend at the time was never intending to, I believe there were dynamics in play where I was reacting in a triggered response at least every other time with sex, even times I initiated things or thought I was in the headspace for it. I also want to say there was a time frame where it was happening more often, and it lasted that way for enough time for me to start despairing and feeling potentially ‘broken’. Things were made worse with my partner initially questioning the realness of my memories resurfacing, this was the most hurtful and triggering of anything that occurred, due to hearing the same type of statements from a caregiver when some of the abuse took place. 

All that said, after I finally started staying with my truths, finding the most compatible therapist I’ve had, and also just being assertive about my experiences being legit, things did start to feel less unbearable to live with and I felt less doomed and broken. I just want you to know the feelings of hopelessness and powerlessness are temporary, and hard to see past when you are very understandably operating in survival mode."
