People that come from loving and stable families do not understand this, I have found, and it is useless to try to explain the dynamic. They sometimes just think that you're mean for doing it. When family ask about it I tell them the truth but keep it short. The narcissistic parent is an expert manipulator and they can make you look like the bad guy, lol. I hope someday that you can find that peace with your parent. Maybe you already have. Every situation is different and remember that my kids are now grown, so that impacted my decision as well. However, my mother did try to manipulate them when they were younger, which I really struggled with. Do I take their grandmother away from them? Etc. Good luck with your situation. Cheers."

But if you think about it logically, what are the chances that any civilization, much less a species that resembles us, exist at the same time as we do in the vastness of time since the Big Bang? Personally, I believe we may be the first sentient beings, at least. That being said, I'm not saying that there couldn't be rudimentary life forms out there or even more complex life, in terms of reproducing,etc. But the odds that a life form lives in our galaxy, or close by, have eyes, and are flying craft that look like Star Trek ships to spy on us seems very unlikely to me. The universe is fairly young yet. The odds of this happening are so astronomical that it defies any logic that we as humans could fathom. It's a nice fantasy, though."
