exmormon,fbymr6r,t1_fbym2pz,1577220875.0,"Thank you so much!  It’s tough, the hurt has been done.  It will definitely take a lot of healing and forgiveness for that to happen.  💙"
exmormon,fbyhxat,t1_fbyhmmq,1577217326.0,"Yes!  A huge piece of me has been missing.  It’s the religious Mormon bs that they took to far and cut me off.  🙁. I’ve celebrated with friends and their families every year since.  I didn’t realize how many people had weird family dynamics, I thought I was the only one."
exmormon,fbyf97d,t3_ef1awa,1577215421.0,I haven’t seen my immediate family (active Mormon) in almost 10 years.  This photo really resonates with me today.
exmormon,fb972mq,t1_fb80rzp,1576631036.0,"Interesting statement!  I think once you see the business and money side of the church it’s enough to lose whatever testimony you started with.  Looking back I’m not sure I ever really had a testimony- I believed because I was told to and just went along with it.  I had no choice though since I was a kid/teenager.  As an adult, using my adult brain, so much is amiss and I would never ever sign up or buy into the 3 levels of heaven crap amongst other things."
exmormon,fb7r3am,t1_fb7qyr5,1576597417.0,"Right?!  Makes sense!  It’s insane, even though I’m so far out and detached, there is still the lingering mind F of the cult 😩😩😩"
exmormon,fb7pzqw,t1_fb7ngck,1576596664.0,"That makes a lot of sense.  Why should the participant suffer because the person performing the ordinance lied and is deemed unworthy.  Thanks for sharing this.  It’s all bs, but hypothetically speaking, if “the church” was true this would make complete sense."
exmormon,fb7napg,t1_fb7n3b3,1576594758.0,I agree 100%!
exmormon,fb7mzcc,t1_fb7m8wc,1576594528.0,"It seems to me that it would be invalid since the person performing the ordinance is a liar and an “imposter”.  I always say this, but “the church” sets people up for failure.  I think if people answered the temple interview honestly very very few people would make it inside.  

I went through the repentance process many times as a teenager, and the immense amount of shame, and guilt I felt passing the tray on during sacrament, being unable to partake because I was deemed a “sinner”.  I think at that point I had only made out with a boy or 2, but according to the bishop at the time I was on a downward spiral to hell lol 🤕. What a mind F all of this is.. smh 🤦🏼‍♀️"
exmormon,fb7lt6s,t3_eboyw9,1576593661.0,I agree!  Fuck this cult! 🤬🤬
exmormon,fb1y5ks,t1_fb1vwi3,1576442863.0,"They push it on you all through your younger years and adulthood.  If you have some sort of independent though left after the mind f, when you look at everything for what it is there are 101+ reasons to walk away.  Packing your bags and leaving takes a lot of courage.  You will go through periods of guilt.. I did- good ole “Mormon guilt”.  Listen to your heart, your mind, your soul, and your gut.  All human beings have within them the knowledge of right and wrong- “the church” gets it wrong on many levels. It truly sets people up for failure in my opinion, amongst many other things.  I’m not bitter- I’m in my 30s and haven’t been in ages.  I’m just happy I see it for what it is.  Leave when you’re truly ready.  Don’t let anyone pressure you, guilt you, or discourage you.  You will leave when it’s your time to go 💙"
exmormon,fb0ognr,t3_eazwpj,1576427855.0,"I never made it past baptizing dead people,  From the way the endowment ceremony has been described, & from the videos that I’ve watched on YouTube, I think I would be really creeped out.  Adding a sex offender to the mix makes me SO thankful that I listened to my 16 year old intuition and left “the church”.   Glad they caught that sicko."

exmormon,f98tb6q,t3_e4bwop,1575182628.0,I believe in God and hardly drink.  I haven’t been to church since I was 16 (in my 30’s now).  Just because you leave doesn’t mean that you have to go to the polar opposite extreme.  - just my 2 cents
exmormon,f98s2t3,t1_f98prd0,1575182162.0,"Sickening... 

On a side note most of my patriarchal blessing was about  the word of wisdom- I was pretty disappointed.  Huge build up to it, and then a complete let down 🤦🏼‍♀️"
exmormon,f98ooci,t3_e4832m,1575180913.0,A lot of “competent” physicians prescribed life damaging opiates to lots and lots of people.  Interesting perspective they have.  #gag 🤮

exmormon,f97rn53,t1_f97rcff,1575169404.0,I have the papers to remove my name from the church and haven’t been since I was 16.  I have finally made the decision in my 30’s to jump ship.  People keep telling me about this letter.  I guess I know how I’m spending tomorrow morning :)

I am a female in my  30's and have experienced being homeless at 16, bullying, and rape that comes with homelessness.  I was adopted into a fucked up family, and have suffered from abuse as well.  I want you to know that I have experienced thoughts of suicide many, many times.  You are NOT alone!  I hang on for the sheer hope that it will get better and things will eventually fall into place.

JustNoChurch,f94msle,t1_f94cii9,1575093859.0,"Thank you for your kind words.  You came out on the other side as well and that makes me happy.  I do not feel strong some days, but I keep pushing.  

It’s a complete Mind F isn’t it?  That back and forth between the “what if it’s true” and “what if it’s bs” gets exhausting.  At some point you have to make the choice and walk away.  I completely agree with the last sentence of what you wrote.  There are many religions that believe that they are the one true religion.  With so many making that claim, how does one really know?  And the more unraveling I do of the Mormon church, the more I realize it’s all bs."
exmormon,f94gi5h,t1_f94fl86,1575087530.0,"I haven’t thought of that before.  If you don’t resign and have your name removed from their records (a very long and intricate process), they will find you, and still consider you a member of their church.  Mormonism isn’t something that you practice on Sundays. It embodies every minute and every second of your life.  It’s a way of life and dictates the way you live.  Unfortunately a lot of people are born into it and don’t have a choice.  🙁"
exmormon,f94ev0j,t1_f94dlc9,1575086039.0,"Sadly in the Mormon church, it doesn’t work that way.  They always end up finding you.  Resigning is the way to completely sever ties."
exmormon,f94esvq,t3_e3o5uq,1575085984.0,I have mine printed and am signing and getting it notarized tomorrow.  Such a courageous thing you’re doing!
JustNoChurch,f949k12,t1_f9492nh,1575081415.0,"I literally never thought of that.  The minute I decided to go against their Mormon beliefs, they started trying to convince me that I was the one with the mental illness.  I never thought that it could be the other way around!  Makes perfect sense!  Thank you 🧡"
exmormon,f93yhy8,t1_f9223iu,1575072014.0,I agree with this 100% !  I left the church in my late teens and lost my family (who is still very active to this day).  It almost destroyed my life.  It has been extremely tough to recover from losing them.  Most days I feel very alone.
JustNoChurch,f93x1zv,t1_f93tku8,1575070850.0,Thank you!  I will check it out :)
JUSTNOFAMILY,f91fc2f,t3_e310m2,1574988290.0,"I REALLY needed to read this today.  I cut my ""family"" off about 4 years ago, and for the same reasons (lots & lots of abuse).  It seems easier at times, but then there are days where I miss them, or the concept of them, & family.  It hasn't been easy for me as it has been difficult to get close to people.  I am in therapy working on learning how to build healthy relationships.  

I know that we do not know eachother, but I am being honest when I say that I am proud of you for staying true to yourself and walking away.  It takes immense amounts of courage, which you, my friend, have.  Stay strong, and reach out with you need to chat/vent."
