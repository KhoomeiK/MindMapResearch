itookapicture,fgepeyg,t1_fgep6jo,1580705623.0,Lol I should make it the symbol of my entire freaking life in that case
analog,ffpaxa2,t1_ffp8bd4,1580090514.0,Thank you!  That is a 1954 Dodge...I spent a while perusing google images to figure that one out!
analog,ffngt6z,t1_ffnfyon,1580065778.0,Thanks for the critique!  I always get so worried about using a wide aperture at night because it’s so difficult to focus sometimes.  I might retry this shot around f4 though.  Definitely worth a shot!  Thanks again!
analog,fekig99,t3_epj180,1579200717.0,Congratulations!  I’m coming up on three years myself.
AnalogCommunity,fe5xyrn,t1_fe5xxbj,1578877435.0,"I’ll check it out, much appreciated!"
AnalogCommunity,fe5xupb,t1_fe3nhy1,1578877363.0,"Just saw this, thank you!"
AnalogCommunity,fe5xthb,t1_fe418po,1578877342.0,"Thank you so much for the info!  I already have a ilford stop bath and rapid fixer, which developer would you suggest?"
AnalogCommunity,fe34mwa,t1_fe316pl,1578845857.0,"Yes, film onto reel, into tank, 100° water into tank.  You think that’s the issue?"
AnalogCommunity,fe2m6ys,t1_fdwwxyv,1578840404.0,"I just developed another roll, was careful with all the temps, got reticulation again.   Everything was at exactly 100° throughout the entire process.   Could this problem originate in the pre-soak?  That’s the only time there has been a temperature spike."
analog,fdyj4ry,t1_fdyimik,1578780336.0,That’s great advice!  I’m going to try that tonight!
AnalogCommunity,fdxtbbl,t3_en8nsx,1578772694.0,Well with the DF96 you control development with temperature as opposed to time.  Normal development is 80° and each additional 10° increase is pushed one stop.  I feel like I should try standard 3 step chemicals as opposed to the monobath.   Time is easier to control than temperature.
analog,fdx3om5,t1_fdx1wh8,1578764988.0,"If I remember correctly I was at f5.6.  Probably could have went to f8.  Also, I scan the negatives with my DSLR so maybe that wasn’t perfectly focused."
AnalogCommunity,fdwct10,t1_fdw919f,1578757428.0,"That sucks, it ruined some of my favorite shots on that roll..guess I need to pay closer attention when developing.  Thanks!"
AnalogCommunity,fdwce61,t1_fdwaz62,1578757281.0,Haha well it’s never happened to me so I wasn’t 100% sure.  I wanted confirmation so I can make sure it doesn’t happen again.  Weird thing is it’s not on every exposure on the roll?  Thank you!
AnalogCommunity,fdwc0rk,t1_fdwabay,1578757182.0,"I pre-soaked at 100° and washed around 100°, maybe there was a burst of cold water during the wash?"
analog,fd7b8j3,t3_ek85kq,1578201864.0,I LOVE the juxtaposition of that bright red with all muted colors around it!  What a great shot!
BipolarReddit,fcnfxn0,t1_fcn51js,1577810898.0,"It is sometimes.  Once you do though, it’s an accomplished feeling."
BipolarReddit,fcldhm2,t1_fclcu1z,1577745276.0,Yeah I could tell that it wasn’t going to be long before things took a real nosedive.  It gives me pause to realize that I’ve been using romantic relationships as an escape for the last fifteen years.  No wonder none of them worked out!
BipolarReddit,fcldbrf,t1_fcl2yro,1577745169.0,Thank you for the encouragement!  I need it now more than ever!
BipolarReddit,fcldae3,t1_fcl4lgy,1577745144.0,"I think the fact that we CAN recognize the issues is a huge advantage in our favor.  It really takes me back to when I was gambling and spending thousands of dollars on stuff I didn’t need, sleeping maybe an hour a night, but I couldn’t see what was happening.  I couldn’t even slow down to think about why everything I was doing was just wrong.  Now I can at least slow down and realize it’s just my brain, and I can do something about it.  I’m not a prisoner in my own mind anymore...for the most part!"
itookapicture,fc4hhgd,t3_eg3bmq,1577416793.0,This is such a great use of depth of field!  Beautiful shot.
itookapicture,fc4hdmh,t3_eg1xsx,1577416702.0,This is an awesome capture!  I really like how the flow of water seems to disappear into the abyss..super moody and thought provoking!
BipolarReddit,fc3gi9i,t3_efyelo,1577389291.0,"The biggest issue I can see with disability is that, even if you’re somehow approved, it takes FOREVER to get processed and approved, it is not something that would be approved overnight and help your situation.  The best bet is asking your employer to just be patient as you go through this period of instability."
nocontact,fc21qbt,t1_fc21a9c,1577336972.0,"It’s not pathetic, even though it feels that way sometimes.  It’s just like withdrawing from a drug, but at least an addict knows when they’re getting a fix.  We don’t have the luxury of being able to see a needle in our arm.  Our addiction is in our minds and the “get well bag” can be an idealized thought or an “innocent” peek at their FB.  I’m with you in the struggle though, we’ve got this!  They don’t deserve our time or energy anymore!"
BipolarReddit,fc1zrpn,t3_efhont,1577334944.0,"It took me about two months for me to a) really notice the effects of the meds and b) get accustomed to how they made me feel physically.  I WAS on 200mg lamictal and 1050mg of lithium...stopped taking them and need to get back on ASAP.  300mg lamictal should be tapered up in like what, 8 weeks though?  So it might take a while for the meds to actually get to a level where they are effective."
BipolarReddit,fc1z8mc,t3_efqk07,1577334422.0,"I’ve been off my meds too...can’t sleep, will go more than a day without eating, binge eating when I do eat, really craving alcohol after almost three years sober.  I think I’m with you on getting back on meds..lesser of two evils I suppose."
BipolarReddit,fc1w7uj,t3_efq2g4,1577331619.0,"I still think about the last time, two years later..every day is a win, and I’m so happy you gave yourself such a fantastic gift.  You’re truly an amazing, strong person!"
nocontact,fc1qov0,t3_efc4ct,1577326678.0,I spent all day thinking about how much fun I had with her on Thanksgiving...blahhhh get out of my head!!!
BipolarReddit,fc17471,t3_efh2rj,1577310155.0,"Merry Christmas to you!  I needed this today, truly a wonderful post!"
bipolar,fbzd05z,t3_ef7ye1,1577242617.0,A breakup and yet another Christmas completely alone!  Yay!
