cyclothymia,ey3rbfu,t3_cv0tlg,1566771676.0,may i ask how you’re diagnosed with cyclothymia and major depressive disorder?

cyclothymia,evdsa8v,t3_cjhbk6,1564446179.0,"often people with undiagnosed cyclothymia/BP1/BP2 who show mostly depressive symptoms will have mania when given an SSRI because it’s only treating one half of the issue and the other comes into light. it would probably be very helpful to see a doctor about this, because if you keep it unchecked it’s bound to get worse and impact your life a lot more."

bipolar,esurgow,t3_c92szz,1562287904.0,"oh gosh i have to say the same. i go through weeks where i can’t do anything and i always feel the worst, but he sticks around :’)"
bipolar,est0bm9,t1_essrufy,1562260332.0,"definitely when i’m hypomanic am i pretty sex crazed (wanting to do it all the time, experimental, etc) and when i’m depressed it’s like anything sex related repulses me, even the thought."
cyclothymia,eskumv0,t3_c6pnuz,1562073887.0,"To be diagnosed with a bipolar disorder type thing, you need to have symptoms like this for at least 2 years, or 1 year if you're \~under 18. It could've been that alcohol was a trigger for your anxiety, but beyond that, I'm not sure. All I know is that for most mood disorders, the periods of mood swings are longer (lasting days to weeks) and not rapid over the course of the day. When you hear rapid cycling, I think it refers more to switching every few days, not every few hours. I know that with borderline personality disorder, the mood swings you describe fall more in line with that, but again there are a lot of other criteria that fall into that. It could also just be symptoms of your anxiety and adhd presenting themselves in different ways, because I know for me my anxiety makes me very irritable."

bipolar,es4q92b,t3_c5tm3z,1561591043.0,glad i’m not the only one who gets depressed in the summer. it’s always right at the start when i’m done school and i have no more responsibilities... seem to lose all purpose and life
bipolar,erizxe8,t3_c2bd88,1560911746.0,needed this

bipolar,er5iukf,t1_er5c8dv,1560526931.0,this sounds kinda perfect.
bipolar,er5ip7n,t3_c0g6bl,1560526843.0,"My meds require me to eat at least 350 calories right before bed time and it’s honestly the worst part about the meds. I either have to take it with dinner and then end up falling asleep at 8 (they make you drowsy), eat dinner, then eat again later OR skip dinner and eat a very late one instead. It’s very irritating. Two times now i’ve forgotten to take them at night and had to take them in the morning (today being the second time) and these first few hours are hell. extremely depressed and wanna die just to get rid of this awful feeling."
bipolar,er5ibbo,t1_er4i953,1560526614.0,"I’ve just recently started Latuda, which is typically a treatment for people 15-17 with schizophrenia, but in mild doses works for people struggling with bipolar. i find that it helps so much because my main issue was that my head would never be clear and id always feel everything too strongly. it really helped my clear my head almost immediately after starting and there are no side effects (that i feel anyway) other than drowsiness (which is why you take it at night). as a byproduct it helps with my anxiety as well and there’s a very big difference when i’m on it versus when i’m off. i’m not sure how old you are and if this even applies to you, but i wanted to let you know that i think once you find a medication that works for you, it’ll be obvious that it’s working. basically when you know you know."
bipolar,ept0epq,t1_eps6jun,1559476742.0,"okay yeah that’s pretty much how i feel. i see all the signs and it’s agonizing but i’m still like “oh you’re just faking it !!”. i feel like i’m almost constantly in a mixed state, with exceptions here and there."
AskReddit,eozxbsj,t1_eouxpsv,1558967829.0,i’m from a pretty large city (Ottawa) and in the suburbs it’s definitely like this too. mostly on the sidewalk but people are usually very nice on the road.
