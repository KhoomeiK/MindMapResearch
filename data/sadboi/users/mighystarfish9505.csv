GirlGamers,fm5l0h0,t1_fm5krpj,1585774912.0,"I dunno cus that would mean that only men-only platforms exist - which is ridiculous. Of course I’m sure we have all had shitty experiences as a woman who games. But by no means is Xbox only for boys. And any platform allows for the ability for private game chats, party chats etc and if you only invite your girls then hey! Girlfriends only platform right there x"
GirlGamers,fm5idf5,t1_fm5i9z5,1585773519.0,Honest to god this is why stereotypes exist around girl gamers. COD ISNT THE ONLY GAME ON XBOX
BPDmemes,fbt0jx5,t1_fbt01n9,1577065105.0,"It’s taken me two years to receive a diagnosis and still on a 10 month waiting list to see a specialist. I find the opposite effect... hormones completely exaggerate all of my bpd symptoms! If you think it’s endo definitely push for a diagnosis.. I’m UK so have NHS so easier said for me. However, if they weren’t alarmed by anything surrounding investigation of your ovaries then that’s a good thing; they didn’t find any scarring from endo growth woo!!"
BPDmemes,fboaxt0,t3_edx7lt,1577008660.0,Endometriosis lol
BPD,fadf3ws,t3_e8m5nn,1575968160.0,Amen to this. I also have endometriosis which exaggerates ALL of my bpd symptoms for like two weeks of every month
BPD,fabhp0q,t3_e8chmg,1575923392.0,"I can cycle through this in a day or within a few hours. It’s intertwined with ability triggers which lie extremely close to abandonment. I usually find the motivation comes from an honest place; you want to get better, you want to achieve. But this is closely followed by self doubt (questioning ones ability). The thought of not being able to do something then becomes overwhelming, thus you’re back to triggered headspace or feeling like you won’t ever get better or even worse... can’t. 

I find it with mundane things too.. the weekly shop. I get all mustered up, I’m gonna walk through the park get some shopping etc. Then I just don’t, I question my ability to get dressed, to even choose what I should wear. I find myself checking the weather app several times, making sure I’m dressed appropriately. Then I can’t even find a simple outfit to throw on to go to the shop.. the seed is then planted. If I can’t even dress myself how the fuck am I gonna leave the house.

BUT.. we just need be kind to ourselves. If having a shower and cleaning your teeth is all you can do one day then praise your progress and achievements and don’t doubt your ability to do more on the days that you do. Some days I’m at university 9-5, cooking a weeks worth of meals, doing my extra reading, housework, public transport, podcasts, gaming and tv show catch up all in one day. Others I put fresh pjs on and call it a day.

ITS THE SMALL VICTORIES AND THE GOOD DAYS WE SHOULD BE THANKFUL FOR. AND GOD DAMN PROUD OF OURSELVES FOR."
BPD,f9l0bbq,t3_e5gic4,1575411574.0,I can purposely trigger depersonalisation by staring at my toes or hands for too long. Man body parts are weird af
BPD,f87epdt,t3_dz9hq3,1574329580.0,Books! I always do this with books.
BPD,f81temi,t1_f81swa9,1574176925.0,"Mines called Bumpy Doodle (he has those bumps *bumpy doodles* that worm fabric gets that just feel amazing to touch haha). Even talking about my blanket makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside. 


Aww yay. I'm glad his words though mine did that!!
So happy there's other people that experience such deep love and need for Blankets haha"
BPD,f81sc7e,t1_f81rzhj,1574176212.0,"I have the exact same... Its even got a name. And its got to the point that other people know the blanket is a he and almost a person not a blanket if that makes sense.

But the beautiful thing is the love that you put into the blanket is your own, so the love you feel back from it is yours. - my therapist always says this to me."
BPD,f81qvkp,t1_f803c8i,1574175211.0,Yep it's crazy. Around 75% of the population according to Hurlburt (2011). There's some really interesting psychology regarding conscious experience and the physiological phemonema that is inner speech! It's more common in those with psychological abnormalities.
BPD,f7yc4f4,t3_dy13tj,1574091804.0,My internal monologue is basically a life interview. So fun(ish) to find other people who do this! I recently found out that most people don't even have an internal monologue... Imagine not having the voice inside your head. Mind blown
