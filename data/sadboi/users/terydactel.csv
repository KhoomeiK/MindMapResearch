Watches,fplrswr,t3_ge7r41,1588718242.0,"Kinda depends what your end goal is honestly. If you want to grow a collection, I say get the mid range watch and hold off on the grail. In a way the longer it is unobtained the better as once you get it part of that ‘grail magic’ lost. It’s like the thrill of the chase is gone lol. If you see yourself being totally content owning only the omega, I say keep saving. I dont see much point in purchasing a mid range to liquidate after a few months or a year. You’ll just be losing money most likely."

I did it all using the pliers on a leather man multi tool, if yours is really hard you could go at it with some sand paper til it gets thin enough to manipulate maybe or just sand the entire mushroom cap off"

whiskey,fmnc3yn,t1_fmnbqkz,1586222719.0,Yea that’s what that one article I sent did. They got no lead emission as a result. Not sure why they hadn’t caught on yet. Also not so much for decanters but for rocks glasses I like the weight and feel of lead crystal. I don’t care how a decanter feels in my hand though lol
whiskey,fmnb6dy,t1_fmnao5i,1586222119.0,"Not that I know of. I’m not super well versed on glass though, I doubt there would be anything though. I only know a decent amount about lead crystal because I did a research project on lead emission from crystal glassware. As far as why people still make it, its softer and can be carved for that reason allowing very intricate and beautiful designs. Basically it’s just a luxury item that is fun to look at and break out at parties. Fits a similar role to fine China."

whiskey,fmn90vi,t1_fmn52yh,1586220763.0,"If you can’t find information from the seller/manufacturer you can typically tell from the weight, there’s a pretty significant difference. Also hold it up to direct sunlight with a white sheet of paper or wall as the back drop and see if it causes an incredibly vivid rainbow on the backdrop. This is because lead crystal has a much higher refractive index than normal glass. Also you can see if it sounds different when ‘pinged’ than normal glass."
whiskey,fmmgqhr,t1_fmlkno9,1586204962.0,"Often antique lead crystal decanters, if they’ve been used, are safe. In ‘Release if lead from crystal decanters under conditions of normal use.’ They found 50, 163, and 1410 micrograms lead/liter for 20 year old, 10 year old, and new decanters respectively. Most of the lead is gone after 10 years of use, if yours is truly antique odds are it’s perfectly safe. Of course, any level of lead is bad lol. Also, look at ‘Use of Modified Crystal Decanters With No Lead Migration for Cognac Storage.’ Basically they added a protective glass layer which i would imagine you could have done at any glass blower to your decanter. There was no lead migration for the protected decanters."

If retractable isn’t a big deal, I’d get the Prometheus writes alpha pen. I own both in titanium and prefer the Prometheus for the cartridge and overall feel, there’s absolutely no tap of the cartridge against the body as well which is a huge plus for me. Both are excellent options though."

I’m jealous though, engineering is so interesting. 

And yea dude I’m a senior in undergrad (I say that because it sounds like you’re at a similar point in your life) and I’ve kinda given up on dating. It’s unfortunate but I’m looking for something serious and long term and the majority of women I’ve been in relationships with weren’t looking for that. I think guys like us need to wait a few more years and then start really looking. After I got heart broken for the third time my friend sat me down and had a heart to heart and basically said I was dating college girls but wanted a women so I shouldn’t expect anything besides heartbreak. There was a lot of truth in that I think. Our time to shine will come, we are investing in our future and in a few years we’re gonna be golden bro, you’ll be working for spacex with a steady career and be looking to give a girl the world, someone is gonna see it dude and whoever she is is gonna be one lucky girl haha"

I really hope you find an awesome girl who doesn’t give two shits about height bro. And any woman who cares about height to the extent that they write off a dude on that alone is most likely not mature enough to be in a long term relationship. It’s all about give and take.

Watches,fd5mrxf,t1_fd5mgos,1578179160.0,That was my initial thought as well but I believe it’s authentic. I think it’s a little bit of an illusion from the camera how the date window seems slightly off.
Watches,fd5mea7,t3_ek3s25,1578179043.0,Looks authentic to me but dirty haha. As long as the dealer is reputable and the price is reasonable I would trust it.

balisong,fcus278,t3_e6x38c,1577987355.0,Need buying advice. I got an AB 3.0 on the last drop and love it but want something a little less ‘solid’ for my next purchase. By that I mean feels lighter and more bouncy if that makes sense. Almost like a bm51 but heavier. My thoughts are replicant or the Atropos channeled titanium kirat with zen pins. With that being said does anyone have advice on which one would be better for what I want and when the next replicant drop should be expected?
SuicideWatch,fctahtu,t3_eiqkwh,1577937297.0,"I went through almost the exact same thing about a month ago...

I like to be social but I get burnt out so I have to take breaks every now and then and just be alone. And try your hardest not to cut anymore, I know for me it’s just regret... it’s nice to feel something but try and embrace the numbness for now... I hope this helps"
