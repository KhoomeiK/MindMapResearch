math,fhb2ue9,t3_f23pxq,1581433540.0,"Definitely repeating a few points brought up here, but consider looking into applied maths, and possibly a CS minor to enhance your implementation of your knowledge/skills. I don't know if you'll still be able to commit to another minor on top of that.

Career wise, a lot of my applied maths batchmates specialized towards financial / operations research, and that is where a lot of business and finance job opportunities lie. I was in the minority that specialized more towards modeling and analytics, which I feel is more industry-agnostic. I *think* either of these two still have activity in research/academia, but I'm tempted to say analytics might be hotter in demand... I'm biased though :>

Also just a thought, but you might also consider looking into science & maths communication, given your possible interests in multiple STEM domains and perhaps your strong arts/language skills? Even if you don't end up in a strongly involved R&D-like position at the forefront of discovery, good science communication is vital in a) convincing the masses the utility of such research, and hence the need to lend support to such projects; and b) inspiring new people to seriously consider pursuing different STEM domains."
math,fhayt84,t1_fhack26,1581430723.0,"Honestly same, I landed in applied maths through basically process of elimination. What really narrowed things down was me trying some basic mini-courses in the few remaining sciences I was familiar with, and decided, *nah*.

I was close to going down the CS route though. But at that time the CS scene in my uni was too competitive (probably still is), and I was kinda a late bloomer in terms of appreciating and navigating maths before uni clarified things for me."

MathHelp,fg5lnyj,t3_ex08rx,1580530917.0,"In both cases you're trying to merge the -v with the fraction on the same side, so that you can work on one larger combined fraction. One way to do that is by rewriting the -v as (-v\*{denom})/{denom}, using the denominator from the fraction. Then with a common denominator you can merge (-v\*{denom}) into the numerator of that fraction.

Put it in more algebraic terms: 

a/b - v = a/b - vb/b = (a - vb)/b"
