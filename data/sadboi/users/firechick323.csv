NewJerseyMarijuana,flhd02x,t3_fou921,1585160371.0,Currently still in line. 1 hour total so far. I think there’s about 1/3 rd of the line left in front of me
NewJerseyMarijuana,flh9kdf,t1_flh7z1q,1585158591.0,"No problem. Currently in like 28 mins. I can see the building now 😬 it looks like they have 1 car at a time filter into their parking lot , that must be where the slow down occurs. The line is building steadily behind me."
NewJerseyMarijuana,flh7fco,t1_flh6qa6,1585157467.0,"I arrived here at 945am , there was already a line of over 50 cars , and was given a slip and told to come back at 2. Nervously, i arrived here at 1:20 due to seeing they aren’t accepting anymore patients. I was told in the morning when i come back to go to the end of the main line. There are about 50 cars in the line presently (i counted the best i could as i was driving to the back) someone in a golf cart comes to your car and takes your card and slip as well as the menu they give you with your order on it. The line seems to be moving fairly steadily. I asked him what happens next and he said as you move through the line you get to reception and they take care of the rest. 

That all being said I’ve been in the line for 10 mins and I’m still pretty far away from
The actual break water building. Side bar i wish golf cart guy could just bring out the order and i give him cash and go. That would certainly streamline this.

Also please be careful as you drive to the back of the line if you were told to come back. It’s a 2 lane road and people come flying around the bend towards the back. Fed ex trucks etc"

NewJerseyMarijuana,flgns7d,t3_foo5zr,1585146730.0,I don’t think you can leave the line. I received a ticket and was told to come back at 230 and go directly to the back of the car line
