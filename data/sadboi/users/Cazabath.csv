schizophrenia,fffre41,t3_et7ymq,1579890149.0,"What is told to me is that during a psychosis there is a shit ton of dopamine in the brain and yeah that can cause brain damage.  
You can tell them, but imo it is weak argument to get someone seeking treatment. If I'm psychotic I'm thinking about all my delusions, what my voices tell me and trying to find patterns and sanity in the chaos. Telling me it's bad for my brain is kind of irrelevant compared to all the other problems I'm experiencing. And I'm quite reasonble when I have an episode (can communicate normal, work, go out and see friends, know that everything I experience could be made up by my mind). I have no trouble seeing, when someone is through to the other side that (s)he is indifferent to your argument. Moreover someone can think that you are part of a complot and disregard everything you say. This can be said about all the arguments to convice someone to seek treatment.  
Best thing in my experience is to just listen and try to understand what (s)he is going through without encouraging the delusions. Never say flat out that it is not real and that it are (just) delusions, hallucinations. You can give other explanations of experiences. For example two people start laughing when you pass, if (s)he says:""See everybody laughs about me."" Say:""I think that the other one just told a really funny story of his weekend."" You can also ask of they think that there are other explanations for their experiences.  
To get them seek treatment is difficult. Most people who are in psychosis are really paranoid and wouldn't trust institutions and counselors. Of course you can bring it up and say that you think they need help, but if they don't agree don't push it. You will push them away or make them distrust you. Best is if they understand self that they need help and than you can help them to find the right institutions.

addiction,ewvh7wk,t3_cq6e9d,1565806140.0,"I have been there (and maybe starting again being there again) and let me tell you, you don't want to be there. I slept less than 20 hours a week, was really paranoid, there where times where I lived for 3 days on 4 slices of bread and no sleep. By keep using amps I fucked up my study, mental health, self esteem, exaggerated mine social anxiety. If you can stop on your own or maybe with counseling. Imo it is something worth sacrificing your grades for. Forget the whole ""I reset and then only sometimes do small doses"". I think your already to far in, you probably will relapse sooner then later. Only 1% of the addicts can go back to using moderately and it isn't worth it finding out that you are not one of them.  
If you want to stop, stop cold turkey. Amps have minor to no physical withdrawal symptoms. The first few days you would be fucking tired and sleep a lot. Try to distract yourself with a busy agenda. Go to college, hang out with friends (who do not use), game, just anything to get distract yourself from the craving. Remember that craving only last for 20 minutes till 30 minutes (learned this in rehab). Have a back up plan when you start feeling cravings to distract yourself long enough to let the craving subside. A good method is to tell a few people what you are doing and ask if the want to help you. If you feel cravings call one of them, tell them that you have cravings and then start talking about things you like, what you will cook for dinner, how your day was, ect. This alone can help to stop the cravings. Also quit with beer for a couple of weeks. In my experience beer is really good in exaggerating cravings, combined with lower inhibitions makes for an easy relapse.   
Go to the gym. An healthy mind in an healthy body. It will help your body to recover of the onslaught that the amps have done. Moreover your body starts to make endorphins, which make you feel warm and good. And start eating good and healthy, the faster your body recover the faster your mind.  
Last thing, you may experience anhedonia. I don't really have a good advice for it except keep going and engaging in your hobbies, colleges and friends & family. It will get better. It took me five months of being clean before I noticed that I felt (much) better then when I used.

I too have problems keep conversations going outside things I know or are interested in. Maybe try asking and talking about common experiences you both have had. Like ask him about his high school experiences and chim in with your own high school experiences. This can lead to both telling some fun anecdotes. Like ask him about teachers he hated/liked and tell something about the teachers you hated/liked or about the crazy shenanigans you and your friends did in high school. This way you have something to talk about what you both know and get to know each other and get comfortable. Another would be ask about his friends. This too can lead to both telling some fun anecdotes or stories or to how you both see friendship and what you value in good friends. As a plus you get to know him a little bit better through his friends (you are the average of your best five friends).  
Lastly again prepare. Think of questions, common experiences like high school/uni/vacation/friends, think about you want to tell about yourself and what would be interesting to tell like what you are doing with your life and maybe some good stories.

Never had a full blown psychosis, but that shit is fucking confusing. I hope I can give you a clear picture of it, but keep in mind that I'm not good with words and that it is kind of difficult to put those kind of experiences in words.  
Someone can do a some little nice gesture to you like help you with your groceries that you dropped, I then get paranoid (s)he does it to steal from me or poison my food or is someone from one of the secret societies that are plotting to help me and make feel good about myself. Of course this is already to react adequate on the situation. After an hour your voices kick in and are saying (s)he is friends with your coworkers and they all set this up to see how you would react to him her. After that you are thinking of all the things that your coworkers have said to you and have paranoid en delusional thoughts about it. Thinking that they are working with the FBI and monitoring you every motion or that the place you work with all your coworkers does only exist to give you work. This is a small example how one thing can become big, with multiple of those experiences occurring a day everything seems to intertwine, change and you don't know how to react or behave around people, because maybe they are helping you, plotting to kill you or are maybe just actors in some kind of Truman show. Your start questioning what is real and you can't give an answer, because in your head all the hundred paranoid ideas and believes could be real and you just don't know what is real or just a thought anymore.   
When an episode comes to an end all the paranoid ideas and delusions become less regular, but some have been so strong that I still believe them, although I don't see any evidence for them that it is still true. So I become less confused.  
Of course this is for me and how I experience it. I can believe that for someone who have a full blown psychosis that when an episode is ending (s)he will experience what described above."
