bipolar,flxm4t0,t3_frlese,1585585564.0,"Guilt keeps me up at night. I can‚Äôt shake it. Cause who I used to be before my diagnosis and my medication is not who I am, but I can‚Äôt change the things I did or explain myself to the people I hurt. Or my goodness, the ways I‚Äôve embarrassed myself. üòÖ"
bipolar,flxlk6e,t3_frrvxc,1585585254.0,Propanolol can be used to prevent panic attacks. You take it before you enter a situation where you know you‚Äôll be anxious. It helps keep your heart rate down.
mildlyinteresting,flxkzgd,t1_flxal00,1585584936.0,That‚Äôs what I saw too haha

bipolar,flxkl3j,t3_fro7jg,1585584713.0,Proud of you! All very well said. Keep on your journey!
bipolar,flxkbx9,t1_flx334w,1585584569.0,"It helps a lot to have a diagnosis. It may be bipolar, it may be something else. But if it is bipolar, just explain to her that it‚Äôs biological and she hasn‚Äôt done anything wrong. Try not to get angry with her. It‚Äôs important to do what you need to do for yourself, but also understand that it‚Äôs an adjustment for her too. It‚Äôs not her fault that she doesn‚Äôt understand. A therapist would also be able to help you with how to talk to her. For now, just explain to her how you‚Äôve been feeling and that you just want to see someone to make sure that is or isn‚Äôt what‚Äôs going on. The fact that she said she doesn‚Äôt understand what she‚Äôs doing wrong, even though an incorrect statement, still shows that she cares about you and wants you to be happy. She might be more understanding than you think. Just give it time and communication."
bipolar,flwg9ml,t1_flwfglz,1585549608.0,It drives me crazy when people say that stuff. And I admire your courage.
bipolar,flwg5sq,t1_flvwcjj,1585549504.0,Same
bipolar,flvug2v,t3_fqebcn,1585532379.0,"Thank you both so much for your replies. I‚Äôm starting to feel better today, so hopefully it continues to get better. I think I‚Äôm just having a hard time finding my footing with all this change going on, and tired of this illness. Sometimes I can get more and more depressed just wishing I was normal. But that‚Äôs not how it is, and I‚Äôm learning, or at least trying to learn, to accept that and accept myself. I also recently joined because of this forum. It helps to see that other people do get it, even if we don‚Äôt communicate in person.
I‚Äôm always here to lend an ear if you want to talk as well. Thank you. :)"

bipolar,flq0yfa,t3_fq7iw0,1585375019.0,"I‚Äôm bipolar 2 but I feel the same way. Especially lately. I think I probably had the gene to develop bipolar, but at the same time, I sometimes think that maybe I wouldn‚Äôt be bipolar if it wasn‚Äôt for the way that I was raised. But it doesn‚Äôt do any good to focus on that because we can‚Äôt change what happened....but I mean yeah, I think about that more than I should."
bipolar,flq0ndy,t3_fq48c0,1585374707.0,This speaks to me somehow

bipolar,flmhp36,t1_fll6jva,1585283954.0,I‚Äôve seen some crazy sh*t with sleep deprivation hallucinations. I‚Äôm glad seroquel is working for you!
bipolar,fkwl396,t3_fl32a1,1584595883.0,"Before I was correctly diagnosed, I was diagnosed with depression. Sertraline sent me into maaaaajor depression, dissociation, and zaps of light whenever I would turn my head. I was watching my cousin‚Äôs new puppy at the time. I had to call someone to come help me because I was so low I felt like I couldn‚Äôt move. I didn‚Äôt stay on that for long.

A couple years later, I was on a really low dose of Seroquel so I thought I could go off of it without talking to my doctor. I had a lot of visual hallucinations and major paranoia."
bipolar,fjcjbqq,t1_fjc2nun,1583222488.0,"You can‚Äôt push her to find a goal and work towards it and you can‚Äôt ‚Äúhold her accountable‚Äù in the sense of trying to make her do something. The best thing my partner does for me when I‚Äôm in a mood is just letting me know she‚Äôs there to support me. She will do things for me and let me know that it‚Äôs okay to feel the way I do. On the other hand, sometimes I get irritated for no reason and she doesn‚Äôt excuse it just because I‚Äôm in a mood, and I love her for that too. Of course, if I explain to her what‚Äôs going on she‚Äôll forgive me, but she doesn‚Äôt let me bulldoze her feelings either. We remind each other that both of us and our feelings are valid. The reason others are mentioning medications and therapy is because that is the solid foundation that needs to be put in place before you try to fix any specific issues. If she‚Äôs not taking care of herself or at least trying to, everything else is going to be much more difficult.
She‚Äôs also an individual, so we can‚Äôt answer every specific question. You need to communicate your feelings to her honestly and she needs to be able to do the same."
bipolar,fjci8ks,t3_fcqtog,1583221191.0,Yeah I‚Äôve experienced that before. I think that‚Äôs what it is.
bipolar,fjce5wi,t1_fjbtyq8,1583216707.0,This makes so much sense. I‚Äôve wondered about this for a long time.

bipolar,fjccls7,t1_fjatfy4,1583215170.0,"Also, shortly after I quit seroquel I started having vivid hallucinations so that scared me away from trying new medications"
bipolar,fjcbwj0,t1_fhgkco1,1583214510.0,"I‚Äôm curious about this too. I‚Äôm on lamictal and it‚Äôs worked reasonably well but I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs enough.
I tried seroquil, it just made me sleep all the time.
How‚Äôd the conversation with your psychiatrist go?"
