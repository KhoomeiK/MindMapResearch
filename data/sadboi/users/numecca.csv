They worship God. Or they believe in a Grand Creator. If they believe that, then how do you overcome their resistance to the idea that they are the creator; that they are god?

What I‚Äôm trying to understand. Is how these concepts could be presented to somebody who is religious, where they don‚Äôt offend the belief system. Or are not presented I. A way that conflicts with the belief in an almighty God.

Who here has the chops to do just this? Not considering what distribution vectors that would be used to get anybody to even care. 

Crypto does not know how the world works. It stands on this stupid narrative that normal people don‚Äôt care about. Credit cards had the banks as their vector of distribution.  What do we have?

CryptoCurrency,fovd0hl,t1_fovcauu,1588099265.0,This is not a selling proposition to normal people. Manufacture desire please. Because you don‚Äôt understand distribution. Clearly.
CryptoCurrency,fovb6ls,t1_fousnt1,1588098395.0,"It bothers crypto people that every country is spinning up a national currency and has access to everybody instantly. Whereas this bitcoin thing. Not so much. 

# What‚Äôs the plan for this?

Let‚Äôs hear the brightest ideas from this community. On how to compete with the fast follower with every conceivable advantage in the world. Knowing that once people start using it, it‚Äôs like getting them to switch search engines. 

Please crypto, your elaborate plan, for manufacturing desire and distributing this object widely and evenly. 

Tell us.

Wen experience that‚Äôs actually approachable?"

Bitcoin,fodh9bz,t1_fobwjit,1587684670.0,"Notice how I got downvoted. Everybody thinks one way here. And I‚Äôm completely against this thinking. I‚Äôm against the product and your expectation of it if you think that the only thing this thing should do is make you money in fiat. And all the people who downvoted are sheeple. 

So. I‚Äôm going to answer your questions very completely. Because I think you asked a very good question. Starting with the very first thing yo said.  

I‚Äôll be back later when I don‚Äôt feel as mentally lazy. Thanks for your thought provoking comment!! It‚Äôs a good one. And we need to look long and hard at it. Talk soon üôå"

Who here can fix that? Can you do perception modeling? No. Nobody here can. It‚Äôs not important because this is going to fix itself. üçø"
