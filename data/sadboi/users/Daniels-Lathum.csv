Accutane,fkd9uf3,t3_fheh6z,1584072118.0,"I bought niacinamide at GMC once, and as soon as I took it it felt like I was dying. My skin turned red, my body started shaking like crazy. I also felt pain in my stomach for a short period. Then I felt like my body was in a different dimension. I would never recommend taking niacin for any reason."
Anxiety,fkd8z85,t3_f31qmf,1584071485.0,"That was a long message. 

I’m not nervous about anything in my life. I’m in college, and I’m doing what I’m supposed to be doing. All of a sudden I get this feeling that takes my body to a different dimension. I was told that anxiety was the cause of these attacks. Now I get this feeling a lot more often. My only question is how long I will have to deal with this, and what can I do to get rid of this shit naturally? I don’t want to be taking any medication for it. I never had to deal with anything like this. The only thing that’s changed in my life is my medicine for skin (Acutane) that I started taking daily. Anxiety was one of the side effects, but I’m not really sure that Acutane is causing it."
