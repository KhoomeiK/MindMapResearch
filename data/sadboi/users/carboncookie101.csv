AmItheAsshole,fc69bin,t1_fc67ix4,1577475249.0,They are thankfully not complaining about it at all. And my parents understand and I suspect they secretly wish they could do the same.. but they are just so much better people than me. haha

AskReddit,f06gqd4,t1_f06282n,1568437493.0,maybe has to do with the heating turned off by a timer. wood cools off and starts to make cracking noises as it contracts again. (had a similar situation in my old flat)
