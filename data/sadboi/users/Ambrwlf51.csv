Unexpected,f8k8yn2,t1_f8k0fo6,1574608696.0,"I’ve been told that goat’s milk is much easier on the stomach than cow’s milk due to smaller fat molecules in the goat’s milk. As a dog rescue, we use goat’s milk mixed with Esbilac puppy formula for bottle-feeding orphan pups. We never give straight goat’s milk because it can cause “the squirts”. See, I didn’t have to spell diarrhea there!"

I understand what you’re saying ...sugar is probably a bad delivery system for vitamins. I use a brand called “Alive”, hoping it will keep me in that state, lol."
femalehairadvice,eonaxsj,t3_bsh2rt,1558708181.0,"Pre-natal vitamins. Gummies because they taste good. I’m almost 70 and my unprocessed grey hair grows the national average of 1/2 inch a month. So, 6 inches a year is normally what to expect. 

Hair also grows faster in summer. I use an infrared sauna several times a week and it seems the heat also speeds hair growth. I’m curious about your fingernails? Do they also grow as slowly as your hair?"
