depression,fqb18mn,t3_ghdi7l,1589228806.0,"One of the best books for depression was Amy Poehler's ""yes please"".
It's funny but there is this one line that helped me so much.
""The talking and worrying and thinking is not the thing.  The doing is the thing.""  It's easy to remember and reminds me that my brain (and yours) LOVES worrying, thinking, planning, talking, catastrophizing....YOU NEED TO INTERRUPT YOUR BRAIN AND DO SOMETHING.  There is no other way.  Clean, exercise, write, play, take meds, go to therapy.  All the solutions are doing.  Zero of the solutions are not doing."

depression,fp61qyp,t3_gb8bjf,1588344423.0,"This post you've offered up will help a lot of people.  I would encourage you to try and expand on this.  A message in a bottle to all those who suffer from depression.  Get it all out and on paper.  Make it your legacy to drive a sword through the heart of this terrible affliction that so many people suffer from.  Consider this post the first step in that direction.  Organize your thoughts, make this mean something.  You are in a position to speak about this much more than most will ever be.      

The last thing I'll say is don't give up.  Fight this.  Take the next few months one breath at a time and give up no ground to this cancer.    

I'm so sorry this is happening to you.  I don't know you but I have love for you friend."

You seem to know this stuff.

How do you think this all plays out in terms of people returning to 'normal'?

Really appreciate the thoughts and energy."

Seriously I'm curious what you mean by incorrect information?

Harmontown,fnzpru9,t1_fnumxwt,1587398577.0,"He also wasn't nearly as funny as he thought he was. 
Kept referring to 'knocked up' as the avengers of comedy because the cast was so 'stacked'.  Was weird.  There's a reason he's on masked singer I guess.  He was funny in knocked up though.

Harmontown,fnsh70t,t3_g3cgyr,1587221541.0,"directed an ad with Ken Jeong once.  He got it in his head that I wasn't giving him enough respect.  Before you roll the camera you rehearse what's called blocking.  You set marks on the floor so the camera man knows where the actors are going to be.  It's for lighting and focus.  You do this with a stand in, then you bring in the real actor in the case of a celeb.  Until the actual actor is in it's a 'best guess' situation.  We did this, brought Ken in and I asked him to please just rehearse what he wanted to do so we can make some final adjustments to accommodate his performance specifics.  I thought I was being polite and respectful.  The worst is if we start rolling, he does something great and it's not useable because his blocking was super different.  He took this as me 'using him as a stand in' and fucking went OFF ON ME.  He was such a huge crazy prick to me in front of my crew.  My producer called cut just so things didn't get out of hand.  I went to his dressing room to 'apologize?' and he screamed at me referring to himself in the 3rd person etc.  I just said 'sorry' not because I understood but because I had to get my day for my client.  

TLDR:  Ken Jeong screamed at me while directing an ad with him and I still don't really know why.  I think he might be a crazy person or just an asshole."

It really is one of the worst side effects.  Becoming an asshole.  Knowing you're becoming an asshole and feeling like there is nothing you can do about it.  

My tip is to really embrace the stoics starting with this book:
