BPD,fqqfe72,t3_gkaybv,1589564572.0,"I feel this! I could never put it into words. I’m dealing it with now and I do think the more you love yourself and are sure about yourself, the better a relationship will be. I know that when I’ve felt “myself” in a relationship it has been stronger. It’s something I struggle with myself so I’m sorry I can’t be more of a help"
BPD,fqpzx8l,t1_fqppngk,1589557002.0,I find it helps at times but I’m still lost in my brain :(
BPD,fqpy9nv,t1_fqppd8q,1589556166.0,Yeah I have wanted to try seriously for years but I give up each time. Currently on a break from my bf and ruminating on the best thing to do and all the negative stuff is really not helping me sort my issues out. I will give it a try tonight before bed 😌
BPD,fqphhim,t3_gk2fb9,1589546518.0,This is literally me. I could of wrote this. It’s the thing that stops me getting better because I’m constantly living in a state of fear and worry.
vaginismus,fqm6aov,t3_gjkm4e,1589472233.0,Literally what I thought when I watched it 🤣🤣 cakewalk.
BPD,fqe9qef,t3_giadl9,1589304040.0,I feel this :(
BPD,fpxgdt0,t1_fpxehbg,1588982168.0,"Look up Sheryl Paul and her articles about anxiety in relationships, it’s helped me before. It’s always trickier in a first relationship but in time I think you’ll make a good decision. Thank you! That means a lot 😊"
BPD,fpx7to1,t3_gg32v9,1588977335.0,"You are me right now. Currently struggling with those feelings of disconnect and I feel resent sometimes too which hurts. We have been arguing a lot and similar things to what you explain. I decided to go on a break and get some space yesterday so for 2 weeks I’m just going to focus on myself and see what’s what. This pattern has happened in all 3 of my major relationships but it feels so convincing each time and I never know if it’s my feelings or mental illness or both..

I don’t want to leave him either as he’s my best friend but sometimes that’s what’s needed- a break. Maybe you could try having a few days space yourself? Just to see if you feel a little calmer? I know how hard it is trust me, I’m tortured every day by thoughts such as these. I wish you peace and hope you work something out soon"
BPD,fprkwye,t3_get9n5,1588856631.0,"This was like reading something from myself. I get the same feelings and they really take over despite the fact you know it’s irrational. I’ve had the same issue with my bf and a close female friend even tho I’ve also met her and like her etc. The fact your bf is so open is positive and I know it’s hard but be kind to yourself. As another poster said, people without BPD would also find this quite uncomfortable yet with BPD we tend to really feel that jealousy and react in ways we regret. I hope you manage to overcome this and feel better soon x"
BPD,fpcxjek,t3_gc2rw1,1588515232.0,"I’m in the same position as you and it’s horrible. I’m not long distance with my partner but he has a low sex drive and to me it’s very hard as every guy I’ve dated has had a similar sex drive to me. I’m not exactly the horniest person alive but it hurts me to feel rejected and it’s gotten to the point where I do feel resent. Like you, we argue a lot about it and I feel rejected and hurt. I think it hurts me because we went from being very passionate and happy to gradually him rarely initiating and me getting frustrated/upset each time, which obviously makes him feel worse. It’s something that currently has driven a wedge in my own relationship and I feel the same enotuons as you, that he doesn’t make the effort anymore and I miss that feeling of him really wanting me. My boyfriend watches porn too and even though he still makes sexy comments towards me and kisses me etc, it doesn’t feel like how it did when we started dating. There are times where it’s amazing and I notice this happens on days where I am not overthinking/depressed. 

It’s an awful cycle to be in and I know how shit it can make you feel but you need to try and remember that men can have low sex drives, its always stereotyped that all men are sex crazy but it isn’t true. He may feel embarrassed to discuss it and depression does make your libido lower itself. I would try having an open discussion with him and see what he says. It’s a tricky situation to be in because I think with BPD we need that physical reassurance that we are wanted and it must be even harder with long distance. It’s hard to know when we are being irrational or when our feelings are justified and with something like sex it’s hard enough to discuss already. I hope you can sort things out with him. Sorry for the long response, just I read this and it really resonated with me."
BPD,fn51t3r,t3_fzit1a,1586653907.0,Omg yes. I’ve never seen anyone else explain it like this and thought I was crazy.. it’s like I feel left out from his life before I knew him.
BPD,fn1cg2t,t3_fyh7we,1586559145.0,Yeah I get this feeling when people seem to be doing better than me or have anything up on me... really sucks
BPD,fml9k1v,t1_fmkuuqe,1586181819.0,I’m the same
BPD,fml9iqo,t3_fvuc8f,1586181796.0,"I’m the complete opposite. Relationships bring out the ugly in me, the insecurities, my BPD traits are triggered all the time. When I’m single I’m confident, easygoing, feels like the “real me”. Most of my relationships have ended due to BPD behaviours and mental health issues. It sucks"
BPD,fm1h8pk,t3_frjskq,1585678381.0,"Yep. Completely get this. It’s the worst, it’s something I wish I knew how to control but haven’t got the hang of yet"
vaginismus,flwqw8k,t1_flwj1d7,1585561543.0,"No I mean he knows I have this issue and that I’m dilating etc, he just doesn’t know I haven’t had PIV before. I should of made that clearer hahah"

BPD,fi0wvhq,t3_f5tso8,1582046387.0,"I feel this. I don’t act out as extremely but I feel it inside. One of my boyfriends best friends/housemates is a girl. Recently it was her bday and he got her a cake.. immediate feeling of jealousy, why is he doing that for her? Sometimes if he mentions her I wince and act up a little. I know her and she’s actually really lovely and wants to hang out with me more so I know rationally she isn’t a threat but ofc BPD can’t see that lol. I really don’t know how to fix it yet , jealousy is something I really battle with."
BPD,fi0jb6r,t1_fi0igbp,1582038298.0,"It’s so awful I feel like it takes over my entire brain and it’s destroying my relationship. I’m the same, it feels like the worst rejection. I have trouble listening to him talk about it after too, like what happened at the party or whatever. That awful sinking feeling comes. I’m just glad other people relate, it’s a hard thing to deal with and having people relate can be reassuring."
BPD,fi0hx07,t1_fi0h7dx,1582037375.0,"It’s horrible isn’t it, because communication is so important. I’m the same, if I do end up lashing out I always message him after explaining how I really feel and the reasons behind it. I wish I could just stop in the first place. People tell me my bf has changed for the better as he used to be a proper wild child but I’m so insecure I can’t feel that. This whole thing sucks :("

BPD,ffx8v93,t1_ffwh70h,1580320177.0,"Sorry to hear that, that sounds tough :( I am the exact same, I had two really awful relationships when I was younger where I believe this stems from. I don’t even know how to bring it up with my bf even tho I know he is very supportive, my therapist said she will type up something to show him! I hope you feel better soon"
BPD,ffx8lkd,t1_ffwu3ys,1580320016.0,"Yes I do this too, it feels better sometimes when I have my own plans in advance. last night it was a spontaneous thing so I felt even more anxious. And yes absolutely he’s allowed to have time with his friends, I would never deny him tht, just wish I didn’t get so horrifically angry or anxious :("

BPD,ffv6bg7,t1_ffv3tu3,1580256716.0,"I am the same, I like to party and go out etc so it makes me feel even worse for feeling this way. I used to be a lot worse, very controlling and manipulative, I try very hard in this relationship to not be like that person I was years ago. It’s hard. It also doesn’t help when he goes out they all drink until the mid morning, makes me feel so anxious. I’m just glad other people get me :("
BPD,ffuxfne,t3_evc2ha,1580251184.0,"I’m like this with my boyfriend and his life and success, some days are better than others. It’s really hard and something I’m working on in therapy, wish I could offer advice but just want you to know you aren’t alone!"
BPD,ffutaes,t1_ffus2h5,1580248930.0,"It’s just frustrating as I know he loves me and is very open about his love for me, he’s very supportive and reassuring etc, but he doesn’t know how bad things are. I wouldn’t dare tell him in case he’d think I’m a psycho. Also when he goes out they all stay out drinking until 9/10am, it just makes me feel so anxious. He used to be a looottt worse, staying out for days on end, I just hate feeling this way😔"
