Periods,fgxq6et,t3_f0rm5b,1581175550.0,"I am 27 and have the same problem currently, actually. I have polycystic ovary syndrome(PCOS) has your doctor checked you for that? It usually involves (one of these, a few, all or more) labs, pelvic exam and pelvic ultrasound. 

They found mine when I was about 12, which is when i started my period for the first time.

If you're feeling faint and dizzy I would contact your dr. They may want to check your levels to make sure you're not losing too much blood. Mine told me yesterday when i messaged about the same issue, that if it continues they want to check mine and discuss BC which im genuinely not interested in because weight gain and mood changes and the lot.

I dont have much advice to give, however when it comes to getting blood out of fabrics, Ive become a professional, lol.

If you have the brand Dawn dish washing soap/detergent, I personally squirt it directly onto the stain and rub it in either by taking the fabric and holding a side in each hand and rubbing them together where the stain is, or a brush. If the stains are real bad, take the same dish detergent as I mentioned before rub it in and all that and wash in COLD water. When the cycle is done thoroughly check to make sure the stains have come out before putting them in the dryer as once you do dry them, it sets the stains and its pretty much impossible to get out.

As for carpet stains, (which I have gotten out of bed and dripped a trail before from bed to bathroom), use dawn dish soap and white vinegar. You can make a mixture half and half or just squirt the soap on the floor and then pour some white vinegar on top and scrub with a brush. Use COLD water as well in the mix and blot with paper towels or a rag/white wash cloth and then leave a clean towel or something on top and step on it to really soak up excess moisture. That should take care of the stains.

I hope this helps and makes sense, lol!

Also, please know you're not alone, I know the struggle all too well. I'm open to chat if you need help.

Good luck!

I've always been ridiculed over eating, not eating, what I'm eating, etc.. Last weekend I went to a restaurant by myself for the first time ever and it was mortifying. I felt like everyone in there was staring at me, I hadn't eaten at all that day, woke up early and it was almost 8pm so I got a meal and a dessert. I felt HORRIBLE the whole time. 

Personally though. I tend to either binge, restrict or starve and cycle through those quite often. Being legitimately fat also makes people think ""they can't have an ED, they're HUGE!"" Well, we can and do, sadly."

Fevers can do some weird things to our bodies and coughing hard enough/off and on for a long period of time can burst blood vessels and what not so it's in your best interest to seek out care from my personal, not a doctor, opinion


Best wishes, please keep us updated!"
AdultSelfHarm,fde4yho,t1_fdcz0jh,1578331284.0,"Thank you, that means a ton. I'm hoping things start to look up soon since its barely a week in to 2020 and nothing but bad has manifested in mine and my families lives.

It never feels good to fall back into habits you once considered banished from your life in any sense of the word. I hope things get better for you and again, for anyone who needs to chat, my DMs are open. I'm not the best at answering in a timely manner but if its a crisis I'll pull myself out of my own funk to help others. 

Much love!"

AdultSelfHarm,fdcjgse,t3_ekmu50,1578276419.0,"This is relatable as i'm turning 27 in less than 2 weeks and have been self harming since I was at least 12ish? Off and on of course. I went several years without and ended up succumbing to the urges again a year or so ago. Hell, I did it about an hour or 2 ago. 

Please know you're not alone. Its a terrible coping mechanism and hard to quit after some time but as an adult it feels even more difficult to handle considering a lot (i think, if not at least me personally) figured they'd quit once they turned 18 and things would be better. 

I truly wish you the best and if you need to reach out, my DMs are open.

Much love!"
medical_advice,fbzinsa,t3_efaj54,1577247977.0,"NAD, but i have PCOS and my testosterone was elevated somewhat and the other hormones were normal. Currently having similar, but not as extreme, issues with hair, not having periods (its been about 254 days i believe) and am taking metformin for it. I personally say go get your levels checked! Also im 26, going on 27. You're not alone. Good luck!

Edit: for spelling"

morticians,fbc77ig,t3_e63s6g,1576717319.0,"I understand that the things I've described i can handle are very different from in person experience, ive never had the ability to do anything in person except once and my anatomy teacher was a dick and wouldn't let me go due to a permission slip ""deadline"" when I wasn't there the day it was due. Anyway, i appreciate all the legitimate feedback besides the snarky answers. I'm here to ask questions, describe what I can and get feedback that is constructive. There is a difference between being real with someone and having attitude/ being rude. 

I legitimately have always had a DEEP interest and somewhat of a passion for mortuary science, forensics, crime scene photography, etc and I have begun to overcome a lot of things I used to refuse to watch, witness, go through, etc... 

I find that a lot of my issues are flat out anxiety, or so i assume as I've trialed and errored as much as I can.

I truly appreciate everyone for being real and giving me things to consider and try and those who were fairly rude, I'm not mad, im just frustrated as I would like constructive feedback, not just ""ok cool, pussy, fuck off and go do something else"". Type stuff

I don't want to discredit anything anyone has said  and like i mentioned before, all feedback has been appreciated and I plan to look into what I'm able to at some point to maybe shadow someone in the field(s) ive3 interest in.

You all rock for answering (most, if not all of my questions)

medical_advice,fahkm4q,t1_faguo0g,1576087762.0,We have not seen anything like fleas or bed bugs or the lot. Fortunately its getting EXTREMELY cold lately so a lot of stuff has died and gone to hell where it belongs lol. I do have a cream they gave me at urgent care for what they though was shingles but never got a firm diagnosis. It's called triamcinolone 0.5% cream 15 grams from like september of 2018 lol. It has helped very very slightly as far as itching and some of the inflammation/redness

Kinda ok with it tho since 25 bucks + tax&shipping is RIDICULOUS for a CUP lol. I just like it a lot. :("
