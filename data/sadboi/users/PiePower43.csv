But it gets so much better and opens so many more options. Personally o use smash stick cause down smash down smash down smash up smash and side smash. For game and watch the stick can be either smash or tilts cause he’s pretty versatile. I’m not the best at doing f tilt without the stick but best advice is just practice

Down air auto cancels so you can air dodge to mix it up after. You’re super light so be careful. Back air is good at edge guards and spacing. Bait strings are fun. Chef is another noob slayer at ledge.
MrGameAndWatchMains,fpyhso0,t3_gg8nny,1589004120.0,Aggressive back air and defensive forward air (ie forward air drift back). Forward air is foot at pressuring and back air is good at spacing and pressuring but there are times to use forward air over back air. Also shield in neutral is good (up b duh) and even up smash is good in neutral (people think they can punish/challenge but it has invincibility and no end lag)

I was saddened by it but didn’t post on social media or anything. I’m just saying if you actually commit suicide people who you wouldn’t expect will care. There are going to be ass holes that say “my friend died be sad for me” or make a fucking reddit meme so “your memory can live on” but just FYI some people you wouldn’t expect do actually care. Also a good way of not giving those ass jokes free internet clout is to not kill yourself (super useful life hack ik)

teenagers,fnk6j8c,t1_fnk01th,1587016465.0,"First of all, I recognize I’m not the target demographic. I am a 17 year old male and this movie is for little girls. Second, this will contain spoilers.


I listen to EDM/electronic and they literally murdered the entire genre in the first scene. Like honestly wtf. I take this as a personal offense that fucking K. Pop and smooth jazz (honestly can vibe with the reggae and country) get more attention. Like I relate with those fish on a spiritual level. For one, the king fish can’t decide between having a blue or green heart which I totally relate too because those are clearly the best colors but I can’t really pick which I like more. Also he’s a literal fish thing. Third he listens to EDM and electronic and that’s literally my whole thing. We are the same entity.


Ok ok on a serious note how’s the movie? The plot is shit. It’s super predictable and you already know what’s going to happen from the very first scene. This is why I have the “not target demographic” warning because for a little kid, this movie is wonderful. The songs a super catchy and I really liked all of them. It’s super colorful and happy and fun so I understand what they were going for. There were times it got insanely cheesy and I was just like UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUGH WHYYYYYYYYYYY such as, 

tiny bean boy wants to die lol he’s revived so he’s sad

Reeeeeee you don’t listen

Reeeeeee I have no friends

“We are the same” “I’m nothing like you”

Music should bring people together

But overall, the movie is really good for a little kid. They skip over “boring” genres that children are less likely to listen to so no classical, no slow music, no EDM or electronic etc. which I find is a really good choice. By skipping these, (not saying I’m against them but many children don’t find them appealing) it shows that the movie really wants to captivate their audience which I really really like in a movie. If you’re baby sitting, this is a great movie full of songs that the kid’s will love and will keep them entertained throughout the whole hour and a half. Some stupid parts include, 

Yodeling horse dude but NOPE it’s 2 midgets in a costume

I’m angwy wit u UwU I’m gonna swing abut it

Tiny thing dies at the end

HEY LETS RANDOMLY SING FOR COUNTRY PEOPLE 

BECAUSE THEIR MUSIC SUCKS

Baby with deep voice for no reason at all

Country music is about sadness and death instead of actual country themes like horses or farms or jeans or anything actual country has

Everyone has their own rhythm

Pinky promise

PINK PINK PINK PINK PINK


How’s the music? The movie is a musical and I am sorta a bitch for those. I love them. I will lick their god damn shoes. The music... slaps. It’s packed full of bangers. I honestly really really loved it all. Most genres featured have a song upon introduction and honestly every single one is amazing. YES AS MUCH AS IT PAINS ME TO SAY THIS, EVEN THE K. POP. THE K. POP WAS GOOD! I just really like music overall and am not very “oh this genre is shit” because I just vibe with everything so to me, who likes almost anything, the music SLAPS. To most people the music would be eh. Or probably alright. But to me and my kid brain the music was amazing. Keep caution because they do play a tiny part of Gangnam Style and YOU WILL DIE a bit inside when that happens but overall, it’s all very good music. 


Is it worth a watch? Maybe. If you want a dumb fun movie then totally worth an hour and a half. If you’re baby sitting, DEFINITELY WATCH with little girls or little kids that like bright lights/colors and loud sounds (which I think is all of them). 


That’s my review of Troll: World Tour. It’s completely factual so I hope you don’t disagree because then you’d just be wrong. You don’t need to watch the first movie to understand everything. I was fucking high or something when I watched it (not actually but it was like 4am some random night) and I don’t remember literally anything. Honestly good movie for kids but that’s about all. I rate it a 4/10 for being to cheesy and predictable (again, I’m not target demographic)"
