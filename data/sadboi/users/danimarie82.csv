I was working as a nanny while going through a lot of it, and my boss, who is an Internist and also the medical director for our local Hospice, practically begged me to go to PT over the chiropractor. She said that the whole back cracking thing works for some people but she has also seen people get seriously messed up from it. I personally decided that it wasn't worth the risk."

teaching,fpesmfm,t3_gcpy3c,1588554065.0,"This is where I am too. I am certified but only have 2 years of full time teaching experience because jobs are super competitive in my area (NY) and I have made it to the final step on more than one occasion only to lose out to someone with more experience. Every time I ask for feedback I'm told that they think I'm great, but the other person just had more time in the classroom (unless they are lying to me, who knows).

I currently work as a TA and I actually really love it. It's all the best parts of teaching without the meetings, parent conferences, and million other responsibilities. I work 1:1 or in small groups with kids all day, and then I go home and forget about it. I do help my teacher prep and we bounce ideas off each other all the time, but all the real responsibility and mentally draining aspects of the job are on her. The only thing is that the pay is terrible in comparison. I am certified in Childhood Ed Birth-6 and Students with Disabilities Birth-6 with a Master's in Literacy Ed 1-6 (which is more than the teacher I work with) and I make 1/3 of her salary. Of course I have less responsibility, but that part is still disheartening.

NY is a pain with their certifications and I am almost out of extensions and renewals so if I don't get a classroom teaching position in the next 3 years, it might never happen. I'm not entirely upset at the thought of not teaching, I just don't know what else I would do because I don't have the money or desire to go back to school again..."

I'd be lying if I said that I don't still struggle with feelings related to the weight gain from time to time, but ultimately I know that's what is best for me and I just feel better in general. I don't miss the dizziness, headaches, palpitations, and fatigue.

Of course everyone is different but unless your coworkers are really big jerks, people will generally say nothing as opposed to commenting on the weight gain. Good luck and keep up the good work!!"

I have ongoing issues with large pores, texture, and sagging skin that I am trying to come to terms with and I understand that some of it is just genetics. This isn't just a post to complain about my skin...I feel like it is changing again and I'm not quite sure what to do to make it better.

I have really been focusing on moisturizing and being gentle with my skin. I posted a few days ago that it feels like products are not really absorbing anymore and I am starting to experience more issues. For example, my skin has been feeling slightly itchy and tight for the past few days (almost like when you get a sunburn but I wear sunscreen every day and my skin is not red). It also feels ""heavy"", for lack of a better term. At this point I am assuming that my skin is dehydrated, but using hydrating cleansers, Liquid Gold, and 5% Urea cream has not really helped. To be fair, I am not very consistent with the Urea cream but I use the Liquid Gold every night and most mornings. 

I know that I am getting older (but I am still only 37) but I don't smoke, drink only occasionally, try to stay on top of my hydration (a minimum of 80oz of water a day) and always wear sunscreen. So although I try to be as positive as possible, sometimes it does frustrate me, especially when my skin actually feels uncomfortable. Any other suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!

- Rinse face with water in the shower

- Neutrogena Hydroboost Gel Cream applied to damp skin

The day I picked up the car, my dumb ass had just assumed the final price (and the quoted payment) included all the taxes and fees. It did not include the taxes. I was both angry and embarrassed for being so naive that I just agreed to everything. I rolled it into the financing so the final payment was $40 more per month than I was expecting. I had also put down a $500 deposit to hold the car (it was being shipped to the lot) and at the time I didn't want to lose that when in the grand scheme of things, I probably could have saved much more than that if I had been more aggressive in my negotiating or looked elsewhere.

I'm interested to see how it does in the warmer weather, especially before I start using the A/C."
nyjets,ffiiyv2,t1_ffif0tf,1579974993.0,"Chrebet is the reason why I became a Jet fan. For years I actually hated football and the fact that my dad dominated the tv watching it on Sundays. Then Wayne came along and I loved his story, determination, heart, and talent. I have been a fan of the Jets and football in general ever since. 

I finally met him about 5 years ago and told him that story. He's a super nice guy."
30PlusSkinCare,ffiiisb,t3_etogqa,1579974687.0,"I am in the same boat. I lost 100lbs but not until my mid 30's, so nothing snapped back and it was noticeable on my face. I also have issues with larger pores so my skin sagging, even a little bit, makes it more noticeable. Will fillers also help to make the pores a little less noticeable? You are all providing great information, so thank you!"

I'm not going to lie, most days I hate it, but I also know the alternative. I haven't been dizzy and almost non-funcrional for a few months now and while things like wearing bigger sizes again stress me out, I know it is the best thing for living a full life. Keep going. It's worth it. You're worth it!"
studentloandefaulters,ff07t82,t1_ff00fsq,1579466138.0,"I moved to Florida after grad school and had a teaching position for 2 years and while I loved my class and coworkers, I hated Florida so I moved back to NY to be closer to family. Through the years I have also worked as a preschool teacher and nanny but none of that comes close to what I would make as a classroom teacher. I currently work in Westchester County and I only make about $2,000 less than I did as a classroom teacher in Florida but the cost of living is higher.

I've had interviews over the years and I have made it to the demo lesson portion of the process a few times, but I always lose out to someone with more experience. So I'm in that cycle of not getting a job because I don't have experience but needing experience to get a job. In hindsight I should have stayed in Florida for another year or two but I was so miserable at the time. If I had any idea that I still wouldn't have my own classroom 10 years later, I definitely would have sucked it up and just flown home for a lot of visits..."
studentloandefaulters,fezlt1x,t3_eqncb7,1579458763.0,"I graduated undergrad in 2004 and I make my last private student loan payment to Discover on the 25th of this month. Took out about $53,000 and ballpark I can figure is that I paid around 90,000 (I have never seen this info explicitly stated in my account information). The interest rate started creeping up in the last few years so I feel bad for everyone who still has a large balance left to pay. It's so obnoxious and unnecessary. While I am obviously ecstatic to no longer be paying $753 a month on those loans, I still owe $28,000 in federal loans at $200 a month and that's on the graduated repayment plan. It's like the never ending story.

Also, I am a certified teacher currently working as a TA so while I work in the field I went to school for, I am not earning the salary I would be if I could secure a full time teaching position. Unfortunately those positions are few and far between in the area where I live, and even more so if you don't have any connections..."

Rosacea,fc5ie10,t3_eg6uf4,1577458441.0,"This has never occurred to me but I guess that makes sense. I will often get rough, sometimes even painful patches on my upper lip that often involves the skin right above as well. Sometimes it will come out of nowhere (last week it happened while I was at the mall doing some Christmas shopping). I don't know how to make it stop but in my personal experience, no lip balm that I try has helped. I often just use vaseline right out of the tub."

AskTrumpSupporters,fby8tq6,t1_fby3cxp,1577210889.0,"My sister got married with the thought that it was forever. My ex brother in law decided to cheat two years into the marriage and after they had my niece. He disrespected my sister and their marriage so he should be ashamed but my sister did nothing wrong. She even tried to work it out in therapy and he refused to cooperate. 

Sometimes people are just awful to each other and you shouldn't have to put up with that abuse if divorce is an option. There is no reason to be miserable if you don't have to be. In my opinion staying together just because ""marriage is for life"" is ridiculous. My sister is now remarried to a wonderful man who treats my older niece as his own and they just had a baby together. Everyone in that situation is in a better place because of the divorce."

EdAnonymousAdults,fbc4l7e,t3_ecfzo5,1576715519.0,I have this thing where my skin is super sensitive. I've tried explaining it to people but they look at me like I'm crazy...it's almost like overactive nerves or something. If I accidentally hit into something the pain lasts way longer than it should and is often more intense than I would expect for just bumping into something. Sometimes even a tight hug or a pat on the back lingers for a while. I also have back pain but I have had 3 spinal surgeries so that's not really ED related. I do think that I tend to tense up a lot more in general though. I'm just a hot mess! lol

SkincareAddiction,faiowg9,t1_faig8su,1576113111.0,"I honestly had no idea that there was any risk involved and now I'm just really disappointed in myself for not knowing. I don't really use actives very often but I do commute to work 90 minutes round trip by car and now I cringe thinking about being exposed to direct sunlight with virtually no protection. 

Beyond my commute I am not really outside all that much in general except for occasional walks and 30 minutes for outdoor recess, weather permitting (I work in a school). In the summer when I am home more often I reapply lotion as needed and use regular pressed powder to help with oil. I bought the SPF powder to use on my commute home when I felt like I needed it, especially after tretinoin was added to my Curology formula, but I am still deciding if I want to actually use the Curology or not."
