loseit,fpfm48i,t3_gd4i33,1588575553.0,"I like to address things differently. Many people feel restricted while eating healthy because they often see it like like - i can't eat this, i must eat this, i must lose weight etc. I try to look at it as - I want to lose weight because I want to feel good in my body and when I see something unhealthy I'd like to eat, I will tell myself that I choose not eat it because I don't want to (not because I can't). And even if you slip and eat something unhealthy, do not think any bad of yourself, that you failed etc. - we are human and things like this happen, because we can't be 100% perfect. Some people think losing weight = you just eat healthy, lose weight, feel good. However, many times you are in bad mood, you feel like you want to eat something unhealthy, you might lose motivation - it is a very hard journey so do not feel bad when you can't do everything 100%

If I were to highlight one tip, saying 'I choose not to eat this food because I don't want it' really helps me because you feel you have a power over that decision and I really won't eat it."
loseit,fpflcho,t3_gd5hsr,1588574838.0,"I know this weight is very alarming but unfortunately, if she doesn't want to change, you can't change her. But some people might eat a lot if they have some problems and food gives them comfort. So maybe it would be better to sit with her and talk to her if she has any problems in her life etc. Teenagers can have a lot of problems and because she ran away so you don't see her means she is actually ashamed of eating so much but on the other hand, she can't stop it for some reason and it is important to address that exact reason. She might seem very body confident but I don't believe she actually feels good in an overweight body.

At her weight, I wouldn't recommend running as it can do more damage than good but at this weight, even a simple walk is very healthy...but of course, if she doesn't change her eating habbits, just sport won't save her."

notliketheothergirls,fhdgvhp,t1_fhbbf09,1581485930.0,"Yes, I undestand what do you mean. 

What I meant by my comment was that some girls will always tell anyone what gamers they are etc. because someone who just enjoys games doesn't have a need to tell everyone all the time. I don't view this as - some girl plays games = she wants to be cool/unique or whatever. I was only talking about girls who actually say that they are not like others because they play games.

And I believe you are not the case and I truly support people who are really themselves and enjoy what they are doing. And also, do not be afraid to be judged. I know it is not easy when a person is struggling mentally and emotionally but maybe if your wear some merch, you might actually meet someone with the same interest! I mean, you never know? 

I actually agree with this concept of 'uniqueness' you talked about. Maybe because I was diagnosed with panic disorder and sometimes I just wish I was like other people who do not stress about everything and are not overly sensitive (but I also keep in my mind that I'm surely not the only one who feels like this...which helps actually! The most damaging action a person can do is to isolate themselves).

I must admit that my point of view on if girls have always like games might be influenced by the fact that I have a brother who is 7 years older than me  and we always played on PC or PS from when I was about four and I have been in a lot of lan parties etc., so I always viewed gaming as something normal everyone can do when they like it. 

Anyways, what you said is not a stupid rant, it is your opinion and you should stand with  your opinions. And I believe reddit is ideal for discussions like this. Better to have a discussion than just have all people agreeing :) 

All good to you."

MMORPG,esd3qpq,t3_akxlo8,1561846298.0,"Many things seem to be incomplete imo. I don't really think it's P2W - i played international version since 2008 and I never purchased anything through the game. Still had 4 reborn characters with reborn pets. 
Equipment can be broken but only if you fight mobs 15+ lvl higher than you, the destroying process had 3 stages (good, used, wearing) and can be repaired (with cash shop item though). The respawn does not always happen, you can do Goddess Skill quest (which is quite difficult for newbies) with lvl 8 player and still success even if they die during the battle. After bursting with lvl 25 cows, they never moved faster than my team. You can burst to lvl 100 without cash shop weights pretty easily. Getting to lvl 199 does not make sense because the cape has the same stats as in lvl 198. 

I would not say this game was THAT bad because Chinese version is still working and LOADS of people from international version actually move there, there is a Discord group which covers everything, there are people helping with quests for free etc. 
However, one thing that was really bad with the international version was that cash shop points cost...well...too much. In Chinese version, you can get like 2.5x more points for the same amount. Also, the more points you buy, the bigger discount you have (my friend is at 8% discount right now) and you also get points back when you spend them and you can buy IM things with it. So yes, Chinese version does not try to take that much of your money. 

The worst thing about the international version is that the developers stopped caring about the game in like 2013. Drop events were no more just like updates. In Chinese version, there is a maitenance several times a week, every month, there is an even and it is also updated with new items and you can reborn a pet that you could not reborn in the international version."

And after some time I feel bad :( Then it's good again etc. I found that for me irregular sleep schedule is the worst and it makes me feel unwell. I have to work on that."

AskReddit,es4nh9n,t3_c5x7i3,1561589031.0,"For my university internship, I was working in an insurance company office. There was a woman who was talking dumb things all the time. For example, she didn't get how mirrored videos and photos worked. She just didn't get it and asked how a phone could take a mirrored image/vid. Then, she said something like - I don't get it, I don't think you can capture anything mirrored.

 One day, another co-worker brought homemade lavender syrup and told us we can mix it with water and drink it and the woman went like - ,Lavender? Where did you get lavender?...it's a plant, no? So people like...grow it? Or no? You can grow it???'. And in my mind I was like - hey, how can you work in a company like this when you don't even have a common sense."
