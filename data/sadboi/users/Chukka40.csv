nursepractitioner,fg3l36i,t1_fapz1e8,1580484090.0,"YESSSSSSSS!!! Less stress, less anxiety. More respect!"
Noom,fg3l09j,t3_erynkv,1580484035.0,We got this y’all!!! I’m down to 146. Time of the month then back to 146.6 and today 146.8. I’m sure after the water weight subsides it will be back down...
bipolar,ffauucl,t3_esiawo,1579745013.0,Looks like mine!!!
Noom,ff8zn8x,t1_ff72m4e,1579701045.0,"Me too!!!!! It’s incredibly frustrating! I’m gaining and losing the same 2 pounds! I was down 3, but then I shot back up 1.4 pounds. But...I’m still less than I started and like the last poster said, it is as if I go between a certain couple pounds and then it becomes between a certain lower 2 pounds. Like I started at 150, hovered between 150 and 149, then between 149 and 148 then shot down to 147 to go right back up to 150 and then back to 148.4 then 148.8 and then back to 148. It’s incredibly frustrating!"
JUSTNOMIL,fdakrix,t1_fd9avvn,1578247160.0,My husband was adopted and he says he always knew also! There was a children’s book about adoption involved in his childhood as well. His sister was also adopted from a different set of birth parents. She sought out her birth parents and my husband has not. They were both very close to their adoptive family!
nursepractitioner,fb7uxxq,t3_ebqtvm,1576599959.0,"I work for a large orthopedic practice with 17 physicians. It’s hardly a mom and pop with over 300 employees and 3 locations. We have our own CT scanner, MRI and state of the art surgery center. We are huge. I have been working for the clinic for 3 years and we get a substantial christmas bonus every year. Every employee gets one and it’s the equivalent to 1 week’s salary. So...it is not 100% unheard of."
nursepractitioner,fapxsn1,t3_eadzf4,1576294964.0,I’m an FNP working in an orthopedic Urgent Care Clinic and  I work 3 days a week. There are jobs with somewhat flexible schedules.
nursepractitioner,fa5axzc,t3_e102qi,1575813353.0,"I work in a private practice orthopedic clinic with 3 locations and 5 Urgent Care NPs. We see ankle sprains, broken bones and all other orthopedic related injuries and ailments. We work 8-7. M-F no holidays and no call. We do a rotating schedule as well. You work every fifth Saturday from 8-2 and we get paid $350 extra for each Saturday we work. I cannot complain at all. We are all salary."
nursepractitioner,f9ujwp2,t3_e4yuq3,1575652271.0,"So...I’m in a DNP program right now and it’s sucking the LIFE out of me! I want to quit every other day! I am not sure if it’s worth it or not! If you are on the fence and know it won’t do anything for you, don’t do it! I’m an FNP and have been for 3 years now. Love my NP job..."

depression,f3551b3,t1_f34k74s,1570668592.0,If only that were true. The women who are cliquey and exclusive are in their 30s and have multiple children! Some people NEVER grow out of being cliquey bitches!
depression,f354rda,t3_dfmw9f,1570668396.0,"This is 100% exactly how I feel right this very moment! I have always been that friend to most people in my life and it’s extremely hurtful. I was just telling someone today that when I start speaking the same people who were a captive audience to the other person who was speaking just before me, suddenly disappear into their phones . They have inside jokes and memories I am not a part of and they know nothing about me because they never ask. Meanwhile, I always listen to their stories about their kids and offer advice and laugh at their jokes. When I chime in on a group text nobody responds or laughs at my jokes. I have given up and decided to stop trying with these people. The bad thing is, I work with these women every day."
depression,f20vyyk,t1_f20vk1t,1569864754.0,"My sister and best friend have both struggled with suicidal tendencies. I have watched both of them struggle. If they can get through it, so can you. Please hang on..."
depression,f20vnct,t1_f20vk1t,1569864644.0,Do NOT!!! Please don’t!!!
depression,f20q2vz,t1_f1xolay,1569862644.0,How are you today????
depression,f1xo1c6,t1_f1xnpxy,1569801296.0,I’m serious! I’ve been there. Not wanting to exist. Being sad. Feeling helpless and invisible. You have to start living your life for the what ifs sometimes and block out the what is if you can. Lots of daydreaming helped me realize it can and will get better. The only thing certain in life is CHANGE. It will change!
depression,f1xng7q,t3_db29de,1569801021.0,"Don’t do this!!! Life is ahead of you! You do have a lot to look forward to. You just don’t know what it is yet. I assure you, it does get better!"
depression,ewtj9lc,t1_ewmyszc,1565746475.0,"YES! I feel like I’m always celebrating other people as a guest into their life for filler or for a gift, but nobody celebrates me and my life. I feel like if I just didn’t show up one day it wouldn’t matter at all and people would hardly notice."
depression,ewtixuf,t1_ewmqmv9,1565746257.0,"Me TOO! I’ve felt this exact way for a long time. I feel as if I’m not interesting enough for anyone at work to listen to. I start to speak and they disappear into their cell phones. Meanwhile, when someone else in the group speaks they listen??!?! They don’t know the names of the important people in my life, but I know everything about their kids and loved ones. Mainly because nobody asks me. I feel absolutely invisible. It’s a horrible feeling and it’s a recurring theme in a lot of my social interactions. Not all, but enough to affect me."
depression,ewq2h7w,t1_ewpwm6l,1565655203.0,I have moved so many times in search of the perfect place. I now know this is a common phenomenon with depression. Thank you! This and my desire to disappear and feeling invisible to everyone all makes sense.
