wow,ffhdclg,t3_etm5cb,1579930709.0,"As long as essences exist, my desire to play alts is zero.
Done it on 2 toons, not doing it again. 

I dont even care to level a toon because i know i’ll eventually reach the essence grind again and stop playing the character.... essences aged like milk left on a counter in summer."
wow,feznyw3,t1_fexum80,1579459504.0,"Is that why they do this same deal every 6 months??
Its an obvious cash grab.
Its been an obvious cash grab since the Dreadwake mount. 

People who deny this are begging to be robbed by corporations. It’s so blatant that it’s not funny.
Imagine if my way of saying Thankyou... was to charge you money. They arent thanking you dude they are incentivising you to buy a 6 month sub. 

Watch them release another 6 month sub with a mount deal.... in 6 months."
wow,few3sjy,t3_eqmfte,1579404942.0,"Are you undergeared or something?
Getting to thrall and killing him with 3 orbs is not exactly hard.

Like fair enough be angry if you want for failing.
But it’s not the visions fault you died, its on you to perform at “high” enough level to kill a boss with 2 mechanics. Work on your gameplay and the vision wont punish you.

And before you tell me how behind you are, unless you fucked up EVERY vision you got this week then you’re not. Get more gear, pop food and flasks, use lust and down thrall it’s not hard. 
If you’re under ilvl 430 start by getting geared......"

wow,fevrqmj,t3_eqqf82,1579400735.0,"I thought it was the same as the others before it so i just rushed thrall and missed my cloak upgrade.
Big brain right here."
wow,fevnjzn,t1_feuc2rm,1579399381.0,"Exactly.
People who complain about raider io are cro magnons"
wow,fevnbh0,t1_feupu3m,1579399285.0,"Make your own groups then? 
I also main priest but i’m not gonna sit around complaining about not being a druid. I just make my own group...."
wow,fep5i6h,t3_eq7wd0,1579312583.0,A portal too and from the Vale would be really nice. Uldum i can kind of tolerate the way it is.

The rest of us will die horribly..."
wow,fei2deq,t3_ep9ucr,1579128764.0,"Just go for thrall or whatever the stormwind last boss is.
Dont bother faffing about trying to explore yet, the cloak upgrades are far more important.

Just take it easy on the mobs leading up to thrall, i almost died pulling them all on my first vision.
Do you have your essences? Are you undergeared?"
wow,feg1ess,t3_eovgpo,1579072796.0,"Focus your BiS essences, its very worth it."
wow,feg183m,t3_eowp6z,1579072576.0,"You wanted furries, and this is what you get!!!!

Ide prefer Blizzard fixed every other clipping armour piece in the entire game. But 15 years later i’m pretty sure it’s not going to happen."
halo,fdmstwp,t3_em5bfw,1578564062.0,"I end up on SE asian servers too, i was literally just thinking about this.
I finally found a queue and it dc’d me anyway.

I get the impression that the matchmaking is not 100% functional, i would like to believe invasion isnt dead yet. It’s a lot of fun."
halo,fdhp58s,t1_fdhl5hh,1578427364.0,"This^
I am yet to find the report function. I think a lot of players would actually report afkers and bots if the function to do so wasnt hidden in some convoluted UI probably on microsofts website.....

Make it a simple right click > report 
So then we can start making it easier for 343 too see who’s obviously hacking and exploiting"
halo,fdhnms9,t3_elg5sc,1578426466.0,"Or just remove the exp cap.

Its like bloom, it should not be in the game."
