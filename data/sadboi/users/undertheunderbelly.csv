fresno,fqu14aa,t3_gkhgp4,1589649987.0,"I lived in El Centro for a year and a half and I lived in Fresno for a little over a year and a quarter and let me tell you, Fresno beats El Centro hands down. Unlike El Centros brown landscape, Fresno had a lot of green trees, grass, shrubs. There are hiking trails and parks and dog parks. There's even a disc golfing course in woodward! Fresno is about 10x the size of El Centro with a lot more choices in food, shopping, and people. When it gets hot, it's only about 105 and it's no where near as intolerable or long as El Centros half-year summers. It also actually gets cold ! 

I like Fresno. It's not perfect, but damn if its not leagues above El Centro, CA."

puppy101,fot64jq,t3_g9e30k,1588045505.0,"So for whatever reason, your reaction to her biting is enough of a stimulus to overcome her love of her toys. Whatever you're doing - whether it's yelling, pulling away, playing with, or moving around - needs to stop. When she bites, make a fist and SLOWLY pull your hand away . Don't give her attention, turn your body away. Eventually she will learn that biting means playtime is over."

DepressionRecovery,f5h6pf5,t3_dnx2ba,1572201141.0,"There was a day I forgot to take Effexor without realizing it and had the worst headache and anxiety. By the mid afternoon, I ended up getting a migraine from hell and had to leave work early because I literally couldn't tolerate even looking at people (I work in a clinic where that's kind of important). I went home and collapsed on the floor and cried for an hour curled in a pitiful ball. 

Didn't realize it was withdrawal until the day afterwards when I saw I didn't take my daily medications. I was on the lowest dose too. 

That shit don't fuck around"

""She must be so agitated at me. She must hate me."" - This thought is probably my anxiety. I'm going to put this in the anxiety box and analyze it later. 

Then I'll try to distract my mind with an activity. 

Or ""I'm just a useless piece of shit."" - This is depression talking and means I probably need to nap this shitty mood away. 

It helps most days."
