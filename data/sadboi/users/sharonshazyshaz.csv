 I have noticed that in my case if it is a female doctor I say a bit more than when it’s male."
Fibromyalgia,fmrgnog,t1_fmr6vpo,1586322638.0,Yes. I also write down everything and somehow when I get there I only say a couple of things and I just feel guilty saying the rest.
Fibromyalgia,fmqoizr,t3_fwpgmm,1586303721.0,"I remember when I was around 14/15 yrs our doctor told my parents that I was looking for attention because he couldn’t figure out what was wrong with me. I am still not over that and I hide how I am feeling most of the time. I am almost 30 now but each time I get test results from doctors I feel like that teenager again. This whole thing  sucks.

I am so happy though that there are people out there who understand and are going through the same thing."

Fibromyalgia,ffcx396,t3_essl6s,1579809077.0,Thank you for this. I am going to copy the parts that relate to me and send to my family and friends. The struggle of keeping a job in this condition. Migraines and brain fog are the worst for me. I will in meeting and my ability to process information or make a sentence just disappear. It makes me feels so dumb and useless.
mentalhealth,ffbw644,t3_esr13w,1579784776.0,"Yep and it is amazing. Now that I don’t have instagram I realized that they were things I used to do or places I would visit just for pictures and to check in. Now I am doing things I really enjoy and have saved a lot of money, time and emotional stress. Delete it and don’t look back!!"

Fibromyalgia,fee7n8o,t1_fedlhey,1579028079.0, My heart beat super fast if I drink/eat anything with Caffeine in it. I will try cutting the other things you suggested. Do you have any advice on what to eat especially for breakfast? I usually have eggs for breakfast/yoghurt for breakfast so it is going to be tricky to cut out dairy and eggs.

southafrica,fay950v,t3_ealvsq,1576396865.0,I understand what exactly she meant and seriously stop labeling everything as racism. Let people share the experiences ( which as a black woman born in the 90s can totally relate to). The question should be why does it make you uncomfortable when people share their experiences that are race related?
