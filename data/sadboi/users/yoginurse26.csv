getting_over_it,fisdiji,t3_f9gab3,1582682765.0,"I think your indecisiveness is a symptom of a bigger issue and that's evident by your self loathing and spending a lot of time trying to get motivated but the pressure you're putting on yourself is keeping you stuck in a very exhausting cycle. 

It doesn't sound like you're in the right place right now to commit to a new career path. I think it's amazing you have a stable job, relationship and have lots of passions all involving working closely with others and being of service to others. But you're trying to fix a lot at once. And I think you need to learn to change your inner dialogue and take manageable baby steps to build yourself up. I think that will lead to you ultimately having more clarity with your career choices and life overall. You just need to disciplined in those small steps to change. Motivation is transient, you don't require it to make changes to get better, you just need commitment. Spending one less hour laying around on days of will add up over the week. Maybe you can start therapy to sort yourself out. But please be gentle on yourself.

Also you have so many passions, not one job may fulfill you in all. You might want to consider what's best in terms of what education, loans, time commitment, type of work schedule, job duties, etc. you want to deal with when you start the job. Those are all important to consider."

Makes me feel less cursed. I know how terrible this all is. My psychiatrist said the propranolol should act not as a preventative med, but as needed for panic. What has helped with the psychosomatic part for me has been CBT. I worked with a psychologist for 9 months and it did help me manage a lot.
