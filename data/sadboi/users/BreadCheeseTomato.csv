I took the biggest bong rip, looked at my friends and giggled waiting for their reaction. Next think I know I am alone in the room. I look over at the turned off tv and these terrifying clowns on a carousel were singing. With each turn of the carousel it was like each clown exited the television. I felt a malicious vibe from them. They were getting closer and closer. I was screaming, crying, completely afraid. I yelled out ""stop fucking touching me!""

And then I was back. I never moved and my friends were across from me again. My friends mum even came downstairs to check what was going on and lit a lavender candle for me. She had her hand on my arm and a worried expression on her face. I realized I had just screamed at this beautiful lady.
