lgballt,fqpu0ka,t3_gk6py5,1589553957.0,"Other people here have already said their takes on bi being an umbrella term, but I would also like to give a take on it as well.




I may not be a pansexual, polysexual or omnisexual, but I would like to present an explanation on why bisexual would possibly be considered as an umbrella term for pansexuals, polysexuals, and omnisexuals.




In theory, there is definitely distinctions between these terms. It's easy to see as it is defined clearly here. Now in practice when determining what sexuality you are, it's not as easy as it looks. What's common for all four of these sexualities is that there is attraction to more than one gender, so it's easy to identify yourself as bisexual because the experiences are similar and the differences between the sexualities gets blurry. Identifying as either of these sexualities but bisexuality would be easier when there's representation of that sexuality in their area, being online often enough in LGBT areas to know that such exist, or always learning more about other gender identities and sexualities under LGBT, but that isn't the case for everyone who would possibly be any of the three sexualities presented.




Some places have little to no representation of those three sexualities, possibly having more bisexual representation than any of these sexualities. Some are very busy with their lives that they don't have enough time to learn and question their sexuality further if they really are bisexual or don't question it further because they feel that the label bisexual fits their experiences accurately, even if there other sexualities that accurately capture their experiences better.




Regardless whether we like it or not, the label bisexual might have become an umbrella term unintentionally because there's lack of representation or knowledge of other similar sexualities, and it's okay if those pansexuals, polysexuals, and omnisexuals formerly identified themselves as bisexuals before knowing that these other similar sexualities exist.




Determining your sexuality isn't an easy process, and you are still valid even if it turns out you might be wrong about your sexuality. It's not the end of the world if you were indeed wrong about it. At the end of the day, it's just another part of yourself that makes you *you.*




If they happened to be any of these three sexualities, let them be the one to decide that they would identify as either of these and discard the label bisexual. They have to be the ones to do that, not us."
TheDragonPrince,fqplurd,t1_fqpfi32,1589549375.0,"You propose a good story idea on what could've been season 3's romance subplot, but I worry if the build up towards that would overshadow Callum's development if it was executed in the show's limited 9-episode format. If it had more than 9 episodes per season maybe, but as it is now I like it. That being said, I would've preferred Rayllum to go slower than what we had in the end. Callum's feelings for Rayla came off to me as a surprise considering how he had just gotten over Claudia. Maybe more ship teasing in Rayllum, just never becoming canon that quick. But considering the possibility of TDP getting cancelled after season 3, I think it was a good decision for Wonderstorm to get it canon quick along with developing Soren as a character, letting Claudia go down to a questionable path with her father, and other things that make season 3 great."

It was only in the beginning where it was difficult to moderate the community and make announcements when there were like 3 mods available to moderate, which wasn't enough for the growing community.

I will agree on how hard it is to submit comics though. That being said, there are still a few comics around here that could've been taken down during the implementation of new rules. I checked the comics dating some time after the new rules announcement here. One comic had a teensy eyebrow and a few comics were ""This is Me"" content that might've been taken down due to being overdone and kind of unoriginal, but haven't yet. With that in mind, I don't think the mods would be that strict with comic submission but then again maybe some of them were simply overlooked.

lgballt,fnuxpat,t1_fnuqluj,1587273940.0,"Well, I wouldn't call this my first exposure to LGBT but this idea is like a stepping stone to me to understanding LGBT. When I was younger, I was exposed to the idea that males can be feminine and vice versa for females. From that exposure, I learned that it was alright to be different from others. Heck, be proud of it, although I may had been arrogant and stupid just because *I'm nOT liKE THe oTHer gIrLs*.

During my last year of elementary school, I welcomed the idea of me possibly being a lesbian or bisexual since I noticed that I didn't have a major crush on a boy in school and maybe I might have a crush later on in high school. There was a time I thought I did have a crush on a boy, but years laters it turned out that it wasn't really a crush.

Come junior highschool, I got attracted to a girl in my first year of high school. Then I was like, ""Oh, so I guess I was actually bi all along"". By then, I already had an understanding that men can like other men and women can like other women, and that's okay. Some people are just different from me and it's natural. I didn't care very much about sexuality because of that, although I was concerned if I'm met with hostility, scorn, and fear which was why I didn't come out immediately to others. Last year, I never realized that my parents were actually homophobic until I bothered to listened to them on the dining table. They were just being subtle and casual about it. Younger me thought their jokes about it were just for fun, but later on I learned that jokes steeped in homophobia were still no good regardless whether funny or not. So I guess you could say that I deconditioned myself without knowing that they were subtly homophobic all along."

lgballt,fnudu0h,t1_fntmy2b,1587259880.0,"It might sound quick at first, but honestly I've been questioning whether I was truly bisexual or not ever since December. During that period I was learning, I discarded the label for a while and went with queer before coming back to using the bisexual label again just so things wouldn't get too complicated for me since I was busy with other things. Learning about asexuality, its spectrum, romantic orientations, and types of attraction were overwhelming to me and I definitely had epiphanies about it which were similar to the last panel. I had thought of making a panel where I was actually struggling to comprehend all this and was like, ""Oh my god, what if I'm graysexual all along‚Äìwait, what if I'm feeling isn't correct at all according to graysexuality?"", ""Am I really graysexual? But I get horny at times . . ."", ""But being bisexual doesn't seem right anymore . . ."" I was overwhelmed with confusion because of what I really am and frustration because learning about asexuality and all that isn't as easily defined as a dictionary might have about these terms. It can vary from person to person when it comes to asexuality and graysexuality. It was already difficult enough to decide whether I should go as a graysexual or not thanks to learning about it, but then I had a hard time telling if sexual attraction was present in my previous experiences with crushes. I had made a [vent post about this](https://www.reddit.com/r/asexuality/comments/fz1ali/bisexual_op_confused_whether_to_identify_as/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) in the asexuality subreddit that details this confusion with sexuality.

However, I ended up drawing that last panel because by that time an epiphany struck me really hard because I was able to categorize those attractions with a higher degree of comfortableness than it had before in previous epiphanies. I had some idea that my previous attractions weren't sexual prior to this big epiphany, but I wasn't confident and sure at the time. I didn't like to jump into conclusions easily. However, after reading a comprehensive page about types of attraction again, everything clicked for me. Yeah, something definitely was off about my previous attractions and how easy it relatively was moving on from those crushes."
