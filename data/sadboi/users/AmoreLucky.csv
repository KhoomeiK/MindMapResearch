Once he and mom go to Amish country for fresh fruit and I got some days without them in the house, I'm in a much better mood. I don't even want to draw or create downstairs because I'm afraid my stepdad will laugh at me after asking what I'm doing or make a single mocking remark like he always does.

Otherwise, I'm stuck. I can do some chores, sure, but I'm just in my room most of the day when he's home and he's home all the time. He even criticizes me for not doing much, not doing needed chores, asking how I can live with a roommate if I act like that. He even argued with my mom about my diet and exercise habits, saying I pig out on food and don't move. My mom was pretty upset by that as was I. When that particular argument happened, I broke down. He made me break down several times since he and mom got together.

His accusations have become a self fulfilling prophecy now, I can't do ANYTHING as long as he's home, and he's on disability, so he ain't going back to work any time soon. He complained about me to the point where he actually has something to complain about.

Went from alcoholic rages to ""holy crap, I'm dying because of my alcoholism"" rages. Beyond his rage, he thinks he's king of the household and I'm an irresponsible brat.

Does he show love when he argues over petty stuff? Even pulling the ""If you don't like it, there's the door! There's your car! Just get out!"" and other similarly phrased cards during said arguments?

Does he show love by attacking my character after said arguments? Insisting he be treated like an authority when I'm 25 and not a child? Saying I need psychological help if I don't like how he treats me? (That actually happened one year)

Does he show love by accusing me of things and refusing to back down when I defend myself? Even getting mad that I even AM defending myself? Thinking it's backtalk and all?

Does he show love by saying he didn't even hit me, yet berating and talking to me like I'm a wife beater after finding a single flaw in my personality or behavior?

Does he show love to his own wife by treating her almost the same way minus treating her like a delinquent teenager?

I don't think so. Yes, arguments and fights happen, but verbal abuse shouldn't have a part in that. Saying hurtful things shouldn't have a part in that either. I thought it was just alcoholism, but it's him. He's old fashioned and stubborn, so if his parents taught him the earth is cube shaped, he'll believe that even if you showed him studies proving otherwise.

In my stepdad's household, you're the problem, even if something was ultimately his fault. He'll blame you for thungs he contributed in if they mess up. I never had to deal with my dad doing that. They both yelled, but that's the only similarity between the two. My dad's not... like this.
