ABoringDystopia,fr4k1fy,t1_fr4jm0m,1589890398.0,"Idk about bars, most fast food places are just rush rush, never stop, orders piling up on the screen and you're scrambling to keep up. Then you get interrupted by some Karen over some benign bullshit outside of anyone's control, and fall even further behind, all while being yelled at by customers and your boss. And then when there's some downtime, and you really could use a breather, the supervisor is on your ass because they'd rather see you wiping counters that you already cleaned than chilling for a few seconds because you're mentally and physically exhausted.

And this isn't a busy day, this is a typical day, and you come to dread work every single moment of your life. It just looms over you like ""shit I'm off now but I got a morning shift tomorrow"" and the stress just never stops even when you're at home. 

Coupled with that, there's the financial stress you inevitably have being a fast food worker, and despite that you **loathe** every moment you spend there, you're literally begging for more shifts.

Also, even when you have a couple days off, you know they're going to call you, and you have to grapple with the decision of whether you want to ruin your day of freedom and have a little extra change after rent, or forego the extra hours to enjoy some much needed time off at the expense of having another week of rice and soup.

Oh and then fast food during all this, you get damn near a dozen Uber Eats and other delivery service orders within a span of minutes sometimes, that's no exaggeration."
