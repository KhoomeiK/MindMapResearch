emetophobia,fhzrmdq,t3_f5gqtt,1582008865.0,"I’ve taken it twice... was terrified of potential side effects. I went to sleep after I took it, and woke up feeling a little weird (not n*, just slightly “off”). No v* either time. I was so relieved."
SuicideWatch,ffsm2bv,t3_euo34a,1580185122.0,I am so so sorry that you went through all of this. It was not your fault. Not at all. It is awful that your parents blame you for it. I hope that you can get away from your parents soon!

SuicideWatch,eyw85lo,t3_cz2mrq,1567523253.0,"Completely understand feeling that way. I had a very similar situation. I was having flashbacks every day/night and thought that nothing could help make that pain end. If you have access to healthcare and can see a trauma therapist (or a therapist who also does trauma work) I highly recommend it! I did EMDR and now I can look back on those memories and I feel nothing. I can recognize that what happened was terrible, but I don’t feel the trauma aspect of it at all. Flashbacks all stopped, I feel so much less anxiety every day. I got my life back. I hope that your situation improves and I am SO sorry that you have been called a liar by your family members. If you want to talk about any of it / have any questions about EMDR etc., I’m here."
