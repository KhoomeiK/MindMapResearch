depression doesn't necessarily equal being suicidal, I'm just kinda ambivalent towards life.

The worst thing is the memory loss. I can't remember entire days or weeks sometimes right after they happened. I can't remember emotions, which makes it really tough to talk about my depression in detail.

I actually just started a job in customer service, and I've been complimented on how well I interact with customers and I think co-workers are surprised at how I can maintain my attitude for so long. I'm not sure how to feel about it. Although it doesn't feel too bad if I make them laugh or if the interaction seems positive in general. It makes dealing with not so happy customers or shitty customers easy though.

I feel bad because while small talk can be kinda easy, my feelings being dampened or barely there, makes bringing up any meaningful topics impossible, I can only really comment on what's immediately around me, or just lie about my experiences/feelings."
