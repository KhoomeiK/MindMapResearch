I will be 40 soon, and I am still putting in the work, but it pays off. Neural plasticity is a cool concept to learn and understand. Essentially the more you use a neural connection (lile- oh fire is hot/hurts) the stronger it gets, and the easier it is for the neurons involved to fire. Think of it like digging a ditch for water. The deeper the ditch the more easily water flows in it. When you actively rewire your associations and automatic thoughts you are digging a new ditch and tossing each shovel full of dirt into an old connection. Eventually your trigger will not act as a trigger anymore, because it is associated differently. 

One of the drawbacks of sexual abuse is that it causes folks to associate sex and intimacy in a negative way and makes us feel unsafe. A lot of the work I have done personally involved learning to associate sex and intimacy in a positive way, and now it is about the closest thing to worship in my life. Somehow I was able to start seeing it as sacred and empowering, rather than shameful and debilitating. I have my kinks for sure, but I am not ashamed of any of them."

Marriage is commonly viewed as some magical nonsense where there is no conflict between partners but that simply is not true. If you can handle them and their habits now, you can do the same married. It is control- you have to control your environment so that you avoid triggers until you are ready to resolve them, which is the next step in the therapeutic process.
