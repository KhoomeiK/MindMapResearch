Since it does give people diarrhea he-might-be embarrassed so anything you can do to alleviate that would probably be huge.

And since it is technically contagious (you're probably fine if you aren't taking antibiotics or anything) it's a good idea to excersize as much hygiene as you can together until you know the bug is gone.

AskNYC,fg7h0q1,t3_excbmo,1580592307.0,"In my experience making friends in NYC is exceptionally difficult because people here tend to be busier than they might be in other cities. Unfortunately no matter how much someone may want to be your friend if it involved hopping on the subway to meet you somewhere after a long day/week of working it's just that much harder to do. Same with dating. It's just a little bit harder to find time for friendships when you live here. 

But that doesn't mean you can't. It's just a bit more of a grind. As you get older I think that's also a factor. People have families or are settled down and aren't as likely to have huge social lives. You might have an easier time making friends in another city, like I did, but you might not."

I'm still taking the medicine got 8 more days to go after today and I have a pretty okay feeling about this so far. 

What I'm the most worried about now is developing post infection ibs after I'm cured because I am a candidate for it. I'm in my twenties which is when people usually get IBS, I've had this infection, and I am very depressed which is also considered a risk. 

Wish me luck everyone. I wish the best of luck to all of you in dealing with this awful infection I hope nothing but good health and speedy recoveries for everyone here."

cdifficile,ffz2t37,t1_ffz28az,1580362111.0,"I just found out today after a month of ""maybe but probably not I guess"" that I do in fact have c diff. But a month ago was when it was really bad and I really wouldn't wish that on anybody, even my worst enemy deserves better than that.

If you absolutely have to have clindamycin and there's no realistic alternative look up probiotics that have S. Boulardii as this is the bacteria that seems to have the highest rate of success preventing c diff from most of the accounts I've seen, I think Florastor has it.

Eat a lot of yogurt, drink a lot of water, and make sure you know what to look out for.

Also just to let you know what you're in store for... You may have a successful run on this without getting c diff but this still isn't a fun antibiotic, it is a damn strong one. Even before I had anything that had anything to do with c diff this antibiotic gave me a really bad taste in the back of my tongue that just.. Stayed there for like an hour every time I took it, I got dizzy a lot, I felt nauseous, and a little bit dazed... Kind of like being drunk or high minus the fun stuff. Riding my bike was out of the question. I wouldn't drive a car right after you take it. That kind of thing."
cdifficile,ffz26j5,t1_ffz1avh,1580361546.0,"Idk why he would prescribe something that powerful for what I had....which was....no infection at all. He gave it to me as a precaution. I feel like if we're excersizing caution we should be taking a serious look at...okay...how strong of an antibiotic do I really need? A precautionary antibiotic for a hypothetical infection I could get but probably won't and do not actually have? Do I really need two weeks of this stomach nuking pill? I asked the doctor if there are alternatives because my dentist will probably want me on an antibiotic again when I get my implant put in and he said there were lots of alternatives to clindamycin so like....

Why pick the one that gives people a deadly infection at a higher rate if you don't absolutely have to?

The irony is it didn't prevent an infection.. It caused one."
cdifficile,ffz0fqa,t1_ffz0avh,1580360021.0,What I'm worried about is I stopped my first round of them so early and they like half treated it. Like it isn't as bad as it used to be.

If there are zero other options some people say probiotics help prevent it but that'll depend heavily on what kind of probiotic you're taking.(I believe the kind you want is S. Boulardii. I probably spelled that wrong) yogurt, drink a lot of water, if you get diarrhea get help immediately even if it doesn't seem that bad at first...trust me you do not want to experience what I experienced."
