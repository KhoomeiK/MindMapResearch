memes,fpge8ks,t1_fpg10im,1588600891.0,"I agree that many people’s perception of feminists is being misandrists due to the media’s constant attempts and successes at creating a strawman of the word. This however has always been the case ever since the suffragettes first demanded equal votes for women, therefore not something that has recently been corrupted. So I guess what I’m saying is that while what you are saying is true this is one of the things that we need to address as a society and we should not give up on feminism and I do think that we are slowly getting through the phase that has existed since the 1920s and possible earlier of feminists being seen as ‘crazy’ and I have seen this on reddit of people being more understanding to the real not so scary objective of feminists which is equal rights for both men and women and have great hope towards the future. We should not give up on the word feminism now because it’s perception is corrupted as this has always been the case showing the issue is more sexism than feminism, and therefore as society becomes less sexist the term feminism in my opinion will become less controversial. I’m a feminist and so are many of the people I know and we know that there is this perception of us as ‘misandrists’ which isn’t true of course but we accept that with the passage of time hopefully one day, the view on feminists will change and that is one of the issues in the battle against inequality. Anyways I guess that’s just my input, not trying to argue, just want to add some thoughts. :)"
Anxiety,fol99mr,t3_g82gg4,1587857419.0,"Yes! I often struggle with this but I find it helpful to know that it’s actually irrelevant whether or not we exist because reality is only how we perceive it. So if we perceive reality as “real” technically it is as everything around us is just how we perceive it so it is real, you still feel emotionally connected to things and everything we care about can exist regardless of the “real” condition of the universe as we are seeing it for ourselves right now, so it doesn’t really change anything either.  I find it’s the same with being optimistic, by being positive you make yourself happier and your life is greater as a result as you are changing your perspective which is technically changing reality for the better. We as humans have more control than we realise."

Anxiety,fna95yp,t3_g02gqq,1586793349.0,"Yeah I get this a lot, I used to just make  the assumption everyone hated me, and would constantly think over everything I had done if someone was acting differently. I lately have been interested in Buddhism and it teaches that a way of having peace of mind is kindness and always thinking before you speak so you know that there is no reason for someone to dislike you. However if someone continues to dislike me now I try to bare in mind that they must be the problem not me. However I still believe it’s important to stand up for yourself, under certain circumstances."
