There is tons of advice to use rollers to release the fascial tissue, which is painful but darn benificial. I would hit the roller at the end of the day and maybe first thing, but sometimes the release can cause more fatigue. 

Something that may help is alternate nose breathing in a consistant rhythm.  
It helps to calm the nervous system and will help with your concentration so you can get some work done. 

Plug one nostril, inhale (4), hold (4), exhale out opposite nostril (4), inhale (4), hold (4), opposite nostril exhale (4)..... 5mins +++

it is also known as ""U"" breath as you are ""flossing"" the energy channels.  Done to a rhythm of 4:4:4:4

You will gain clarity, mental strength and a little thinking stamina for work.  It could soothe the pain a little more if the time is elongated 8:8:8:8

Fascia is mostly water so keep up hydration during the day during therapies.  

Chrinic pain is effing exhausting. I hope things ease up for you soon."
