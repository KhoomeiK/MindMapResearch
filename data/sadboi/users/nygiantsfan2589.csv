But I also like turn off your brain and relax games. I remember I used to play Skate 2 so much and just ride around skating. Like hours mindlessly skating around finding cool spots to try different things on. But there are some genres of games I won't like no matter what. I'm not a fan of RPG of Turn based games. I just could never really get into em. I like puzzle games but only a few. I remember there was this game on the psp called""Mercury"" that I absolutely loved.
