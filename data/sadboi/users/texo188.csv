Drugs,fdjne58,t3_ellw1g,1578479345.0,"Hi, I was a poly addict myself at some point as well. Iâ€™ve experimented with a few stuff as well, I have taken MDMA with a dose of speed, or just straight up speed as well at times. Does not feel good, and Iâ€™m glad youâ€™re sober and not chasing those highs hopefully. After the second time of a dose of speed I did, my friend said I turned back to her and looked like a demon or some form of evil sheâ€™d never seen before. I donâ€™t think I was much the same after that either. 
Iâ€™ve tried medications too, like ssri and vyvanse for add, which at this point I think itâ€™s best I stay away from stimulants, and the ssri i guess helped maybe somewhat with mood management, but I didnâ€™t stick to it because I feel like it was just going to stick my brain into this cage of conformation and thatâ€™s not how I want to deal with my problems, at least not anymore. 
I feel you and thereâ€™s always hope, the fact you are taking the medications show you want another chance to be and feel better. You can definitely switch things around, take supplements, work out. Decide whether or not you want to stick to meds, I will occasionally take 5-htp or GABA supplements for the way my brain feels. You should definitely try out a GABA supplement essentially they make you feel relaxed as soon as you take them. Also magnesium is good for bone and liver function, vitamin D, omega-3 for the heart and cognitive function, and B100 complex after food to help you digest food and also good for nerve functions I feel like, I can feel it repairing mine slowly but surely right after I take it, collagen etc. I take those everyday (except for the GABA Iâ€™ll take it whenever I feel like), but those could really aid you in recovering and feeling back to life once again. Those I listed are some of my favourites theyâ€™re so great you should try them out. Taking care of your body leads to your body taking care of your mind, eat healthy foods and also your favourite foods, go for walks in pretty nature trails or even at night if you can to clear your mind and thoughts, try to get moving and find joy within yourself and your thoughts, listen to music that calms you, and Iâ€™m sure youâ€™ll get back into the groove of things. Itâ€™s never too late to repair things and youâ€™re doing great on your sobriety! Keep it up! At the things I listed are things that help me keep it up and feel more full of life as well. You can do it, good luck:)"

Drugs,fdjlnkn,t3_elq1jj,1578476820.0,"Probably both, but I did start my whole drug extravaganza especially MDMA at 16 so I wouldnâ€™t have expected less. But you are spacing them out, I would do it around 4 times every year, I did it maybe twice last year, my New Years resolution is not to do it at all this year. Iâ€™m almost 20 but because I get to experience these drugs on my already deteriorated self from abuse at a young age, I think I would mainly just stick to mushrooms, not even smoking weed at least for now. I think weed also affected my mood after starting MDMA
I have read that your serotonin receptors are never the same after even one or two times of MDMA no matter how spaced out, bc itâ€™s totally unnatural for your nerves to release that much serotonin. Rip, serotonin receptors"

Drugs,fdjkgwm,t3_elpfac,1578475096.0,"In my experience, I started smoking weed at 14 and was having crazy trips, but I liked the thought of losing my mind maybe therefore I was smoking with friends every day. The trips walking out of the forest would be crazy, Iâ€™d get really high (and slow). Then I tried MDMA for the first time right after I turned 16 at a festival, and that turned into doing it maybe 4-5 more times in that year. Shrooms came the year after and I felt really enlightened and woke during that period, something I probably shouldâ€™ve take and ran with vs doing chemical shit. But Iâ€™d say MDMA is a big culprit in that. Serotonin is completely depleted, your brain is kind of never the same tbh. Depending on when you started smoking weed, it could have similar effects as your brain is still developing. I canâ€™t smoke weed now either at almost 20 even after taking a few month break, because I had done it so much before, it doesnâ€™t feel as good or rewarding right now. I wasnâ€™t so bad before but I was susceptible to substances probably because of an addictive personality. Iâ€™ve gotten over most of it but when I relapse it doesnâ€™t feel good or anything like it has felt before. Itâ€™s definitely caused my mental health to be pretty unstable even when Iâ€™m sober sober (Iâ€™m also borderline and mood problems+anxious, stuff Iâ€™m not sure I wouldâ€™ve felt as intensely if I hadnâ€™t done some of the things)If you donâ€™t feel good smoking, try to put it down for a bit, and see how you feel, you really donâ€™t need it and you also feel a lot more clear minded when you donâ€™t. Try to start taking supplements like omega-3 and b100 complex as those are super good for the body in many ways, as well as magnesium. But yeah, if I could go back, and not do a bunch of shit as heavily and carelessly as I did back then, I would probably be totally different now and it would be easier to be happy with myself. You can only improve the future as of now but I think this is most common with people that have a history or background to be susceptible to mental problems as well. Best of luck to u!!"
Drugs,fdjjwco,t3_elpkjp,1578474271.0,"Try not to drink too heavy on coke.  my favourite supplements are omega-3 (good for the heart) and b100 complex I personally think helps with nerve function as well as other stuff, b100 is bomb but make sure you have something to eat before bc I had it on an empty stomach and puked bad once. It also makes your pee like bright green but yeah those 2 are great try them out"
Drugs,fdjjrhl,t3_elpyvj,1578474080.0,"Something in your body is damaged from the binges is what Iâ€™m thinking, maybe try detoxing, even eating lemons help.

Drugs,fdjjma6,t3_elq1jj,1578473879.0,"From personal experience, I wouldnâ€™t take mdma if you get on ssris at any point, you could get serotonin syndrome
But honestly take care of your health first, itâ€™s probably not worth risking it. Mdma even one or a couple times completely alters your brains ability to produce and release serotonin like you had before, so just take caution of that too, could possibly be a factor in lower moods. You could maybe try natural alternative or supplements, idk natural ones but 5-htp every other day restores your mood kind of, but I would take other supplements like collagen and magnesium bc it makes my joints hurt a bit. Personally I find taking supplements and taking care of your body could you just as much good than those medications, they could mess your mind a little bit too with some more side effects like thinning your stomach lining so it causes more discomfort etc. Just my opinion but if you get on medications and they help and you can commit to them then thatâ€™s just as important too"

BPD,fcdz8uv,t1_fcdq2tg,1577615310.0,"I got weirdly dependent on mdma when I was 16 and after. mental health wasn't as prevalent then, so the experiences I did have, especially with sensation, skin, music etc. (btw even then, sex wasn't amazing, mind definitely isn't in it, i find it's more for just intimacy hugs etc) now i'm almost 20, and having taken a break from that party brain depleting bs unbeknownst to me, i decided to try it out a couple months back for my friends birthday. and I think i totally get where you're coming from. the whole skin being almost numb, it's not so sensational anymore with bpd, i almost freeze up if you know what i mean. and yeah, the same physical energy and dopamine hit i would get back then, definitely is almost not applicable now with my mental state. but mainly, I feel like that all ranges with perhaps a problem with a lack of intimacy, or struggles to connect with intimacy. with an anxious mind + mdma, you aren't really able to let yourself go and fully submerge in the experience, chemical imbalance would probably play a role here too. but yeah, my advice is.. take care of your body before and after ingesting the mdma, try to eat healthy foods during the comedown for now, and truly, give it one or 2 maximum more shots if you wanted to )spaced out), if its just the same, please dont touch it anymore. the comedowns i experienced when i wasn't educated have probably leaked into my life and personality to this day and it's harder than anything i can explain. it is absolutely not worth it, regardless of how great it may sound.

You're not the devil, and if you truly believe so, it's probably the devil himself taunting you. Try prayer, at least getting God closer to you in any way so regardless of what happens He's still right by your side, whether near or far.

You're capable of change. If I am then you are. It's all in the baby steps/which feel like they are so meaningless but once your vision brings you step, by step, closer, until you're almost there.
