depression,f72di59,t3_dpl4bu,1573359449.0,"I know how you feel.  Today has been kinda of a bad day as far as my depression.  I don't know why I feel sad, over no reason.  It's very draining to put on your happy mask when all I want to do is stare at the wind and let go , close my eyes and just be me , I'll be myself when I get the chance to have alone time. You know I don't want my spouse thinking I'm not stable or so. Honestly there is no reason for me to really feel like this BUT  I do I have been curse with this disease , it's a weird feeling, you just feel like you don't belong anywhere and I'm so tired of it. I feel so sad right now. So I know what you mean about living a double life.  It really feels that way."

jobs,ezy5jy4,t3_cbglwb,1568258406.0,"I know exactly how you feel.  A big problem is my anxiety that is one of the things that slows me down so much. I been quitting my jobs because or either I don't like it but mostly because I get anxious and I know I have to learn the job quickly so that even gets to me even more so when something way complicated comes aboard that I have to learn I'm just ready to quit because i feel fear of not learning it quit and have to be let go because of not catching on , ppl will definitely will talk about you when you don't catch on quick because they think you stupid I actually learn but slow like I sed having anxiety messes everything up. So my spouse thinks that when I quit a job is because I don't really care I guess but in all actuality I don't want to tell her the truth because I feel like a looser I am already not confident you know.  And it's a bad feeling when you know ppl are talking about you because you not catching on quick like the rest they automatically assume you dumb. Then on top of that years I tried offing myself and every since I feel my memory is not the same so between that and my anxiety but mainly my anxiety it makes me a slow learner.  Is depressing because you don't feel secure in your job specially when you start a job and you need to be cross trained.  Sucks because I don't feel free to talk about this with no one and if I do talk to my spouse she most likely will think I'm just looking for a reason to quit my damn job. It gets lonely I just feel no one understands but me. Hell"
depression,ey9fu1t,t3_cw85xs,1566942380.0,I feel you. Freaking sucks. Sometimes I be like hell best to be dead instead of dealing with all this you know.  Atleast I and nor my wife or my family wouldn't have to deal with me. In this year I had around 5 to 6 jobs and wind up quitting.  Sometimes I wonder if depression will take me out at times I feel like dying will solve it all bcz ppl think always the worse.  So I'm starting to just sitting alone bcz no one understands even my wife I feel she doesn't understands me anymore but it's just she is just tired of me . Idk I'm just tired my damn self.  I wouldn't be mad if I get a illness and I'm told I'm going to die that would be a favor.
depression,exvcmii,t3_cueymw,1566596928.0,"I battle with so much anxiety and depression.  Today I got call from the manager that pretty much I got fired for my attendance.  I had 2 abcense today was the 2cd one I wanted to get my wife's car out the shop bcz she had to go to work and I wanted her to just sleep and I got fk over. Now she thinks I wanted to get fired or don't know what I want in life. I'm so overwhelmed I'm starting to feel even worse about myself I never ever had got fired in 39 years. I'm so mad at myself and I know she's mad at me as well. Yes I was very anxious bcz at times I feel my anxiety don't let me function like I should so at work I wind up being the last in learning stuff or maybe don't learn them at all, then on top of that you feel embarrass bcz you know and feel ppl watching you bcz they think you dumb I'm starting to feel even my wife has lost faith in me. I'm thinking over and over and over in offing myself I feel then her struggle with me will be taking care of and I sure don't want to worry my family with my problems.  I feel like a failure I feel alone. Like on the real I'm starting to feel no way out but offing myself. I honestly feel my presence and existence is a burden.  I don't know if I would give my chance to get out of this mindset but I don't feel that honestly there is no other way bcz at the end ppl gets tired of your crap. Even the ones that love you will get tired of you.  Maybe in all honestly there is no hope for ppl like us we are just running against the wind and is igsosting. I feel alone so alone.  I want to be free."
