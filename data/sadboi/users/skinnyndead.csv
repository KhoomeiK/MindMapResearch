I personally can’t shower at home anymore without super loud ass music or videos in the background or unless intoxicated which can get a bit much at times. The last time my mother had a shower was at home which is also where she was able to function normally for the last time before she passed away.

It will be so hard and devastating for her to hear, but she deserves to know everything and after losing a loved one unexpectedly I know how shocking it feels. I feel like the shock and anxiety is there for a reason and that is so we won’t start to rationalize the death and in the end killing ourselves.

I always wanted an education, and there are a lot of people who don’t have it but still function many times even better than those who have an education and steady job.

I have just never been in such a situation before. Yes she is hospitalized at the moment and I asked her if she can think about telling her sister, which she seems to have done since I got the message from Allison. I was allowed by Laurel to tell her family that she is hospitalized if they ask but nothing more, which I’m afraid my answer to Allison would really tell."

I have had the impression that she has spoken to you, but I do not know what and I think it is time for her to get the professional help she needs and deserves.

I have the impression that she has talked to you, but I don’t know what she has told and I think she needs to get the professional help that she deserves. 

I don’t know about this, I will think more to myself and see if I will write this to her. They told me that there is nothing wrong I can tell and someone really has to know about this. I will really appreciate if you have any comments to it."

depression,f5vf4j5,t1_f5vefrt,1572488045.0,"Thank you for your comment and suggestion, I thought about writing that several times, but a voice in my head is telling me that I would in that way say “yes she is in fact suicidal and yes I have known about it for a very long time”. Since her family hasn’t listened to her until this day those few times she has tried to reach out, I feel like it is not my place to tell them about her issue until she is ready. Sorry, I hope you understand what I’m trying to make sense out of. I am calling the suicide hotline at the moment again to ask what they think would be appropriate to say without harming my best friend in any way."

I am fully aware that her family and closest people should have been informed by me about what she is going through a long time ago and I would have done this is in absolutely any situation if any person I know is in danger. The problem is that I newly got to know her sister and Laurel doesn’t trust them at all with her problems. She “suggested” to Allison a while back that she is suicidal without feeling like she was heard and I am honestly very glad that Laurel at all decided to tell Allison recently that she is hospitalized. I will try to write to Allison the way you commented and hope that she at least understands why I did what I did. If not I understand that too. It would be devastating to loose Allison as a friend because I really care for her, but I’d do anything it takes for Laurel to feel safe and heard."

I once in a while listen to the song my mother wanted to be played at her funeral and get back into the mood I was in at that time. I think it has something to do with my brain not wanting to even stop grieving and also because I feel so numb most of the time that listening to the song and at least be able to cry is a form of relief in itself. I feel like that song brings me closer to my mom and my mind just misses everything about her so much that any emotion at all that brings me back to her is a relief.

When my mother passed away I was also the one to talk on her funeral and I was such a mess. I really understand how it feels to be left without a mother at a young age and attended my mothers funeral at the age of 19 earlier this year. It is so unfair and it is so disgusting and awful all at the same time and no words are even close to describing how it feels. There is no right way to write an eulogy and to be honest I feel like your post was a kind of eulogy itself (if I understand the word correctly, sorry I am not a native English speaker). When I talked at my mothers funeral I was so angry and mad and it was as I wrote earlier a whole mess, but it shouldn’t be nice or fun. I said how fucking unfair it was and how much I miss her, I said all the things I loved about her and why she was the greatest person to ever exist. I blamed myself and I blamed everyone who attended the funeral and I talked about her cancer diagnosis. I honestly regret some of the parts, but that was what I wanted to say at the time and that was the only things I was not numb enough to talk about."
GriefSupport,f5grmjh,t3_dnn78s,1572196390.0,I am so sorry for you loss dear. I lost my mother to cancer in January and it still hurts as hell. Losing a parent is to me the absolute worst thing I’ve ever gone through and I feel your pain so much and know how hard the grief is. Do you absolutely have to finish right now or is it possible for you to travel back home and settle down for a while? Your college is always there waiting for you and losing your mother must be so hard to deal with. Most people attending college don’t have other problems as grief they have to deal with and it is very important that you don’t compare your abilities to attend classes with other people who have a stable life situation at the moment.

Going to your boxing lesson may seem like the dumbest decision or even the hardest task to do right now, but is it possible that you try to take a step at the time? Try to pack your bag, then do your next step which may be to change or to eat something, then the next step which may be to leave your house. It may seem so difficult when you see the full picture, but dividing it into small steps can maybe help you. In worst case you’ll not be able to push yourself to go inside or maybe even leave the house, but the most important thing is that you tried. If there is someone you feel you should apologize to, for me it is always easiest to write a message so that I’m able to write everything I feel I need to say in the best way possible."

I can assure you that even though liking or loving someone so strongly continues through out life, it becomes less “obsessive”. I really hope you are able to sit down and sort things out. You seem like a genuinely lovely person and the last thing your mind should ever worry about are the heavy thoughts you are carrying."
SuicideWatch,f5czhz7,t3_dnj3u5,1572145720.0,Agree. Personally the most hurtful thing is when I tell the person why it hurt and they don’t seem to care or want to understand why it’s so hurtful.
SuicideWatch,f5cz6yj,t3_dnlyq4,1572145460.0,"First off I just want to tell you what a great writer you are. You have a wonderful vocabulary and I am honestly surprised that this is written by a 16 year old teenager. I am considered a regular “young adult” and I can really see myself in what you’re writing about yourself and your experiences. Falling in love at your age is a strange ting and I myself used to obsess over guys for months before finally moving on so you becoming friends with a sweet girl sounds absolutely normal. Taking pictures of everything, especially those things that have a meaning to us is a way of expressing whatever is important to us as an individual and I personally don’t think you having pictures of the girl you’re in love with or taking pictures of your scars is strange. I must confess that I have taken photos myself of scars, not because I want to show them to others or admire them, but just because I’m caught up in the moment and feel like I want to capture the chaos in front of me. I think you’re a very smart teen and you reflect like an adult about several things in your life and talking to someone close to you such as a parent or an adult you can trust in your life or at school would help you see if you should be worried about having suicidal ideation. It seems to me as though you might be numb to some things in your life which may be normal, but also may become something of concern. Don’t be afraid to reach out to adults you trust to talk about your feelings or difficult thoughts you have stored inside you."

Masturbate a lot. 
And watch whatever you want. Rest and don’t stress yourself out by overthinking."
laika,ezd0lbi,t1_ezczzpd,1567843340.0,"No I understood, I’m trying to discuss the options here lol. But I think it would be perfectly possible to make a trilogy or at least a part two as you’re saying. The question is if answering some of the open questions would hurt the first movie. I love Finding Nemo 2, that would honestly work with Coraline in my opinion."
laika,ezcztpn,t1_ezcyxef,1567842986.0,"Right, that sounds fair enough, actually when I think about it, I don’t think it would ever be possible to remake a half as good Coraline. It sounds very pessimistic, but the fact that everything is perfectly in perfect in its own way makes it just perfectly hole as a movie. At the same time I’d never in my life would say no to watch a remake."

laika,ezcyrbq,t1_ezcy64v,1567842515.0,"100% agree, but as long as it doesn’t become a remake or a poorly thought through continuation! This is the sad truth about really good movies, only in very rare cases do part 2’s get half as good or better."

AskDocs,evx4ooi,t1_evwzypz,1564881796.0,"Thank you from the bottom of my heart so so much for your response and for just reading through my messy post. I honestly feel like I have a thousand more questions, but I don't really know where to begin, I am first of all so impressed by your and doctor's in general abilities to break all myths that I as a regular person thought was right things to do. Thank you very much, I have read through your answer a couple of times now and will read through again later so that I am sure that I have not missed any of your points. I will talk with my father about all the points you were so kind to highlight, but I don't feel comfortable talking with him about the nonenal process, because it doesn't personally bother me at all, I am just in general scared because I don't know what this process may do to his body and his health. I understand that excessive amounts of lipids are extracted from his body which produces the smell, I just in my mind start to think that maybe his body looses a lot of important components from his body because of this, or maybe I am just not understanding this to the fullest. I also don't know how to talk about this with him, his wife (my stepmother) tells him every day that he is an old man as a joke which he doesn't take seriously, but sometimes dwell on what she tells him. Through your work with elder people, how do they act when the talk is about their age? He himself says that he is old and I have to prepare for the worst because he knows how hard my mothers death has been and still is for me, I just as I stated in the original post want him to live as long as possible for his physical and mental health and I am just so very new to this because I never worried for my grandparents as a little child and in my eyes my dad has absolutely always been a very active and happy father. Please don't feel the need to have to answer this comment if you don't have time or energy to do so, I am just very grateful for your help you already delivered."
depression,evwszj7,t3_cllwmp,1564872616.0,"Happy birthday!! Please don't cry because of other people's actions. You are such a special person and someone forgetting to congratulate you should honestly not deserve to be called your friends. Please find the strength and courage to do something fun, I always go to the movies alone, and after my mother passed away, I have to go to the movies alone. Is there any particular food you enjoy that you can order home or takeaway? It is amazing that your birthday is on a Saturday which means your most certainly are able to enjoy doing whatever you want today and if you don't feel like going to the cinema, finding something nice to watch at home may be an option. Just please don't use this one special day to cry all day, you can cry any day of the year, but today you should really treat yourself in whatever way you want. To be completely honest after having the worst year of my life, I have congratulated 10% of all the people in my life and I feel really shit about it, but I just have no willpower of anything left inside of me to do it and I believe i have about 20-30 people I somehow are connected to or know in any way that I haven't been able to congratulate, including friends. I really have never done this on purpose, but everything becomes so hard with what I am going through and I hope your friends manage to congratulate you. Me and my friends often congratulate each other late at night and I hope that's the reason they haven't reached out yet. The people closest to me I have always congratulated very late at night because I have used the whole day to find out how to make the most sincere birthday wish."

depression,eulv7dt,t3_cglb3p,1563907975.0,"I’m so sorry you all feel this way. I have 70% of the time I’ve been with others in my life not felt like an outsider, but when mental illness hit me like a tsunami, I started to understand how outsiders feel and how lonely it may be. I’m just thankful that at the point I’m at now, few things feel important so I rarely feel like my new role as an outsider burdens me. Just know that being on the other spectrum is fun then and there, but I think I felt even more lonely at those times I was walking home after having a good time than staying at home now as much as possible and avoiding any contact."
SuicideWatch,ergikar,t1_erfx7bb,1560841056.0,I am so sorry this is what you have to go through
SuicideWatch,ergigvd,t1_erfprto,1560840927.0,"Thank you for both your comments. He is a kind and loving father who has made me sad and hurt a lot of times, but in the end, he is my father so I forgive him always. I think it’s true that he does it because he loves me, but he does this because he worries and he has told me he is worried and therefore texts me. My stepmother also texts me, but maybe three times in a week, but she straight up says that I need to live and not kill myself, which my father doesn’t. I love them and they hopefully don’t hate me, but in my situation where every little thing in my life is too hard to do without cancelling everything and lay in my bed all day, his texts become way too much. I find myself often trying to reply to five different texts from him everyday. I don’t know 100% he does this because he feels obligated, but I have a very strong feeling about that in the way he has changed in contacting me and how he does it. My father has never texted me so much in my life before and since all the texts are simple and without any context a lot of times, I fell like this is all to check that I exist without the constant calling as he did before."
SuicideWatch,ergfmi3,t1_erer62r,1560837272.0,"Thank you for this comment, as I wrote in the post, I really do think he is very kind and loving, it’s just so very hard to answer texts every day, sometimes up to five times a day in the state I’m in now."

depression,erentkt,t1_erejvi1,1560788687.0,"Have your therapist considered putting you on something else? 5 mg I a very low dose for an antidepressant. I started Remeron last week and my starting dose was 15 mg and I believe they are planning to up it at least to 50. I am in no way saying antidepressants are a miracle cure, I’m just saying that depression is all about the brain and medication is the only thing I know of that may help with the chemical imbalance and help the cells start to function properly, especially when you have had this going on for such a long time. Look at this as though you’re riding a bike for the first time, you need a bike to even start biking which is medicine, while therapy is the supporting wheels on the back of the main wheel on the bike (jeez my English tho). It doesn’t sound that good your weight loss, if it’s not a part of you exercising and eating healthy, I would be concerned about that. I really wish you the best, I can’t even imagine how hard it must be for you to go on for so long, I have been diagnosed roughly two months and this is eating me up alive from the inside."

BingeEatingDisorder,erehhzs,t1_eregpw4,1560784242.0,"Okay thank you, your comment make me open my eyes. I have all the four first criteria every day and the last one maybe once a month, but the depression I have and the medicine makes me feel numb most days."
depression,ereejuf,t1_eree3qp,1560782077.0,"The flu-feeling is awful. You just walk for days waiting to get physically well again and after weeks realize it’s all because of mental health. Yes all my tests are great except iron, which should have gotten better. I feel your pain about therapy, I really do! I just honestly from the bottom of my heart want everyone in here to get well, but I only know that a therapist may come up with good suggestions that suits every individual. How do you feel after therapy? Do you feel like me, as though talking may even make bad things I talk about become even worse for real because I point them out?"
