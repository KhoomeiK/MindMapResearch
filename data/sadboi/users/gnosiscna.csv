EatingDisorders,fkcas0d,t1_fkc731q,1584049196.0,"That’s the tricky thing with eating disorders. If you confront it, it will make the person struggling with it so angry and defensive.

Orthorexia is often misunderstood as “being healthy”. So that could be the reason why he’s in denial, he may not even understand what’s happening. Eating disorders are often about control, so if he feels out of control in another aspect in his life, this may be his way of coping whether he realizes it or not.

Always stay calm when speaking about the topic. Always speak out of care, not anger. Maybe preface conversations with “I’m not trying to hurt you in any way or attack you” , or something like that.

The thing for you to remember is that you are not responsible for their eating disorder. If you bring it up in a caring way and they get angry, it’s not your fault. You are just really concerned."

Sometimes the best way to get someone to open up with what they’re struggling about is to ask how they’re genuinely doing.

EatingDisorders,fgpnoye,t3_ezqkjx,1581008453.0,"I have met a few people like you. They struggle with their weight, but don’t necessarily have the typical ed symptoms such as fear of food, fear of gaining weight, body image, etc. From what I learned from them, certain treatment places have made them feel isolated, mainly because the therapists didn’t have any training in that type of eating disorder. I have heard from one person that I met in treatment that she did better with an outpatient team rather than an intensive program. I feel the reason sometimes they get put or suggested to go to a treatment center is mainly to monitor your weight. If you have hyper metabolic syndrome, that can be deadly if not monitored. I would speak to your team about how you’re feeling to see if they understand. But quite honestly, the way I see residential treatment centers is a way to rehabilitate and make sure you’re okay medically, mentally, and behaviors have come to a slow or stop.

Edit: Alsana (I was there when it was still castlewood), from my experience has been pretty individualized treatment. They still have the meals with staff, but in groups, a lot of it is individual assignments that you share. You had weekly meetings with a dietitian and multiple sessions with a therapist a week."
EatingDisorders,fgn5ghh,t3_ez7t90,1580938066.0,"I met a man in treatment once where he was so in denial of his eating disorder, that he didn’t understand why he was there (his parents made “consequences” if he didn’t go voluntarily). He said he was just being healthy and exercising. In reality, he may have been eating more than what a typical “anorexic” would eat, but he would train so much at the gym that he eventually just lost all of his muscle mass and fat. People have put exercising as a good thing, no matter how much you do, which is totally false in some cases. There are health consequences that I learned in treatment that I had no idea could happen with men. You can apparently even lose your ability to help create a baby if you are too malnourished. If you’re hurting your body for so long, your body picks and chooses what things it absolutely NEEDS to keep you alive, and drops the “unnecessary” things. You can lose your menstrual cycle, hair, nails, or anything else that isn’t “necessary” for your own life. I would look at why you exercise so much. Why do you feel the need to? How does it make you feel? Essentially beating an eating disorder is identifying why you struggle, and creating positive coping skills to help. If exercising makes you feel happy and calm, what else can you do, that’s not exercise, to make you feel that way?"

Things can easily turn into a competition with yourself and food when you still have an ED thought process. Someone mentioned seeing a dietitian. That is a very good thing to do as long as you make sure they’re a non-diet dietitian and educated very well in eating disorders. They’ll help you come up with a meal plan suited for your needs. It’s possible that you may lose weight while recovering if you are currently “overweight” (I use that term lightly because it doesn’t define your health) if you are set up on a balanced meal plan, but I believe that recovering first is WAY more important that the goal of losing weight."

My mom eventually took me to therapy when I was about 13 and sat in all of my sessions. She would tell the therapist how I was causing all the problems at home and that I had anger issues. I would try to explain to the therapist what really happened, but he always sided with my mom.

Regardless of how fast or slow you recover, you’re still making progress. You are a lot more than just your eating disorder. I wish you luck!!!

But she’s always talking about how men are disgusting and rude and only want “one thing”. It’s a hidden (not really) double standard that women don’t want to take accountability for. Feminism is being equal. That includes respect."
Ipsy,fbkfukn,t1_fbkfghg,1576949668.0,"Oh, then that’s my bad. I don’t know why but it feels like there haven’t been add ons in a long time. Maybe I just missed them. After over a year of being subscribed, I must be losing my mind. Thank you for the reminder!"
bettafish,fbk58ew,t1_fbivu04,1576944957.0,"He cleans with a gravel vac and hand feeds so there isn’t any waste. He feeds them 5 pellets every other day. I also got him to switch to prime for conditioner. I didn’t even know paraguard existed, so i’ll definitely have him use that. I was suggesting him dose with aquarium salt just a couple of times because i’ve had great luck with it. It helped velvet on my betta when I first got him. He’s not wanting to buy the test kit because it’s “expensive”, so the most he’ll do right now is take a sample of his water to a store for them to test it. it’s better than nothing I suppose 🤦🏼‍♀️ Thank you so much for your help."
raisedbynarcissists,fbive9q,t3_edhrd7,1576916145.0,"I rarely if ever got in trouble when I was a little kid. I loved my parents and I thought they loved me and I always wanted to be around them. It was when I started to get older, 10-11 years old, that I started to get into trouble. It was for the smallest of things too. I remember distinctly that I got grounded over not using the “right” faucet setting while washing the dishes. I got grounded for not cleaning my moms bathroom correctly. I got grounded whenever I wasn’t the perfect servant that I used to be as a little kid. I started to act out a lot as kids usually do, but since I was never heard out, I had a lot of pent up anger. That eventually turned into a lot of hostility towards her and a lot of hateful words and it turned into a huge mess by the time I was 14. At 22, I absolutely despise both of my parents. My mother is narcissistic and emotionally abusive, and my father enabled everything she did."
bettafish,fbittr9,t1_fbitqp5,1576913962.0,Thank you so much. He’s really upset about it. One of his bettas passed about two weeks ago and he got this one in hopes things will go better. I’ll pass along your help to him!
bettafish,fbitqnr,t1_fbiqflz,1576913844.0,Thank you for your help! it’s much appreciated.
bettafish,fbitlz1,t1_fbitbnv,1576913668.0,"That is what I suspected. I told him to do daily water changes and he said he will. He uses prime for his conditioner. Would you suggest him getting stress guard to help with potential trauma to his bettas body?  His decorations are good for a betta, but i’ll double check to see if he’s added anything.  Thank you so much."

mentalhealth,faxchs4,t3_easfbd,1576381876.0,"My scary part is fear of becoming an adult. I was sad for so long, had so many people take care of me throughout my teens and now that i’m better I don’t know if I can take care of myself. Having to support myself is terrifying because i’m scared of working because i’m scared of missing out on something. idk if that makes sense."

If you referred a friend when the 1800 points offer was available and only received 600, I would email customer care about it."

raisedbynarcissists,fai6i6j,t3_e98oqj,1576100867.0,"My mom CONSTANTLY complains about everything. It’s too hot, It’s too cold, she had to work a lot, she didn’t get hardly any hours for work this week, the family doesn’t have a lot of money right now, she doesn’t want to work, my dad ate out, my dad isn’t helping with “anything”, my dad is useless, the house is a mess, she’s too tired to clean, other people should clean up. Whenever my mom starts complaining, all I say is “oh, okay.” and leave the room. I don’t remember her not complaining about at least one thing a day, ever. Even when I was little. I have very little feelings towards her anymore other than anger. I think about what it’ll be like if she dies. I don’t think i’ll cry or be upset. If anything i’ll be relieved a little bit."
Ipsy,fai3alj,t1_fai2671,1576098957.0,but thank you for pointing me towards that website! I had never heard of it. I’ll definitely keep checking that out.
Ipsy,fai2pyw,t1_fai2671,1576098621.0,"My problem with the plus and why i’m so hesitant to try is is you do get 5 full size products, but I absolutely love a lot of the samples too that you receive in the regular glam bag. In the ultimate you get the samples and the full size products. I just can’t justify spending $600 a year on makeup when i’m not financially able to."
Ipsy,fai0cwt,t1_fahzgc4,1576097235.0,I’m glad you commented because I didn’t know about the negative reviews on the ultimate. Honestly i’d love to try it out but I don’t have the budget for it.
Ipsy,fahwvvj,t3_e9bx3y,1576095177.0,"From what i’ve heard I think you can get the different levels of bags at once (like glam bag and glam bag ultimate). I also hear that the glam bag plus is always a hit or miss. Most people enjoy either the regular glam bag or the ultimate. 

Unfortunately it’s too late to receive the december bag and won’t receive your first one until january."
LongDistance,fahm4yf,t3_e9amz7,1576088709.0,"I’d ask her what she needs. I have a friend that’s in college and we’re typically really close and talking a lot, but during her senior year this year, she’s been more distant due to stress and finals. I always say to her that I understand that she’s busy and not to worry about not texting me. She’s welcome to text me whenever she feels she’s available.

I suppose ask her what she needs. She may not want to make you feel bad by saying she would like some time for herself and her studying, but you can reassure her that it’s okay and you understand. 

If she says you’re okay and feel free to talk whenever, then I wouldn’t worry about it. She’ll text you when she can."
