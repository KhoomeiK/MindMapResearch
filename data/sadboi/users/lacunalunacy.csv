Having lived the larger part of my life still as a christian, the son of a pastor in fact, i can tell you that my experience has been just the opposite. There is a structure to the universe, and it may well have been created by a force or being beyond what we can understand. 
How much that should matter to us, however, is all but inconsequential. We shouldn't feel obliged to try to be the best version of ourselves in order to make some grand designer happy. We shouldn't be kind or take care of eachother cause otherwise we could be condemned to suffering. 
We should  seek to be the best person we can because to do so makes us stronger and happier. We should be kind to our neighbor because they are deserving of our kindness regardless of some eternal scoreboard. I argue that a truely good person would live a life of kindness and honesty regardless of whether there's a being above or not.

Ultimately, if having a god helps you to get up in the morning, to give what you don't need to someone who does, to try and make the world a better place, than I hope that god embraces you and shows you the path of happiness.

Can probably find them at a medical supply store. They feel weird with shoes on, but they're pretty comfy without.

So most breaks don't happen just randomly, or just because. There's a ton of genetic and environmental factors. The idea behind the psych ward is to take you out of the environment that is causing the stress, help you stabilize any neurochemical imbalances, and teach you coping mechanisms that will help you stay stable once you're back out in the real world. 
It also provides a comtrolled environment for observation so that if there are mitigating factors like chemical dependencies, you have the opportunity to get clean and let your brain re-equalize so that your behavior can be observed without the effects of those substances.
Most people, even ones with delusions or severe depression don't necessarily want to kill themselves when they aren't having an episode, so the ward is a place to be safe while you are having an episode, and to provide you with the tools to weather the storm and mitigate future episodes so you don't wind up back in the ward.
