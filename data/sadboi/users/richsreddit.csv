AskMen,fqbf7oj,t3_ghw9ei,1589235869.0,In my personal experience time seems to be the most helpful thing when it comes to getting over relationships that ended with little to no closure.

I used to think it was mostly just men who did it but I also realize based on my own personal experience along with what friends/people have told me it seems common that women engage in that as well. It definitely makes the dating landscape seem much more fucked up because it feels like you might as well cheat so you don't end up being the one who gets ""cheated on"". In my experience, my ex did cheat on me before leaving me (she denies this because she broke up with me even though all she just did was make her other relationship official less than two weeks after dumping me). However, this doesn't mean I'm cynical about love nor do I stop trying to make it work because that would only mean fucking my own life up over the shitty things someone else did to me. I'm currently in a much happier relationship with someone who truly appreciates me and I'm grateful to have that now of course."

At the end of the day while you played daddy to her child at some point or even formed some sort of bond it is now over because unfortunately the love between you and ""mommy"" didn't work out.

I do things like exercise and watching my diet as well as taking certain nootropic supplements to help my mood and cognitive ability.
