I was starting to worry honestly ;-; it’s currently 5:08 am rn so sorry if anything I say makes no sense or is too short . I’m glad to know you seem to handling pretty well now , not because it gives me hope for myself , but because I know how it feels and it sucks ass so I’m truly happy for you :) how the heck you manage seeing a Psychiatrist more then once ? I’ve seen 3 in 10 years (very hard to come by ) they always tell me , they will contact me but never do but oh wel , when the pandemic is over I plan on some how meeting more . Hopefully I can find a decent one too :) thanks for helping me not fully give up ❤️ goodluck during this pandemic stay safe"

I guess I’m still in early onset for the voices part of the illness . The loudest I got was like an 8 and it was a little girl laughing for 2-3 secs .  I’m guessing when I reach 10-10 multiple times , maybe illl believe 100% always . But who knows xD btw hope your doing well :D"

Anxietyhelp,fqcwkca,t3_gi5gjw,1589271392.0,"My advice , see doctor . They should give you something regardless if they take it serious or not .  I’m not a pro or a doctor but I wouldn’t wait too long , you wouldn’t want things worse . And trust me , it can get real bad to the point you will never leave your room aka where I’ve been for years . Goodluck ❤️🙏"

schizophrenia,foey5ia,t1_foey1j5,1587718956.0,"Thanks for sharing ❤️ it was good to see you say they locked you in the room with them , instead of locked in your own room alone with the voices C either way I bet that was horrible . Hope all is going smooth for you :) thanks again"
schizophrenia,foexzoz,t3_g5bdjh,1587718786.0,"The side effects . I was diagnosed just before the pandemic . So when I had the worrying side effects , I had no help no one to go to . So I stopped . But my schizophrenia is at the point of development, I don’t need medication . I only gave it a shot because they refused to treat my anxiety , lying to me saying abilify will help both my schizophrenia and anxiety . They did help for voices but yeah . After I stopped taking the meds . Voices came back , and at one point was slowly getting worse . But before a full blown episode it went down again. 1 month or so later without meds I’m fine . I’m still disabled from the anxiety but schizophrenia wise I’m fine . Idk how long I can go before my schizophrenia requires meds but gg . Hope all goes well wit you ❤️"

schizophrenia,fmjbdvv,t3_fvn3v9,1586126863.0,Just wanna add. This isn’t ment to freak anyone . But I find this picture really cool . It was taken around the time I was doing evp (talking to ghosts with phone ) which probably was a factor of my schizophrenia development later on in life . Let me know what y’all think ? Idc if you guys think it’s fake . But if you believe . What do you think this is ? The church back then said it’s my protector . But I doubt it
schizophrenia,fmheo88,t1_fmgg72m,1586077016.0,Your remind me of myself in terms of humour xD everyone gets mad at me tho bc I’m never serious . See you on the 6th floor .
schizophrenia,fmhdro5,t3_fuy1co,1586075985.0,"I thought I was the only one . I’m here wishing I could talk to the girl I keep hearing . Maybe it’s bc I was bullied z maybe it’s bc I’ve been  stuck in a room for 5 years bc of anxiety and have no one to bond with . But sadly . I’m here wishing the voices get worse to the point we can have conversations . I never had any negative voices maybe that’s why . Btw how long till the voices got loud when you first started hearing ?? For me when I hear the girl , it’s so low I can’t make it out and it’s only a word or two being said each time then it goes silent . Unless I’m around noises then I hear a bunch of random stuff almost constantly . Rn I hear her at 4-5 only usually understanding my name or can you hear me .  But when I answer . I either hear nothing or I hear smth that I can’t make out . I feel like I should feel like shit for wanting to talk to the voice since there is many out there wishing they wasn’t Sick with schizophrenia. But it is what it is . Btw hope you and your family is doing well rn In this sad 2020 ."
schizophrenia,fmhdciu,t1_fmhd9vl,1586075511.0,Thanks 🙏
schizophrenia,fmhd70f,t3_fv9olf,1586075336.0,"My schizophrenia isn’t bad yet but for now . Usually everyday I hear things from other sounds but mostly what I hear is my name , for example. Matty , Mathew can you hear me ? I heard a little girl laugh at a 7 for loudness  twice since the onset months ago . I’ve heard rarely like 3-4 times . Kill . Or kill amber which is my sister . For the most part I can’t understand anything bc the illness is still pretty new for me , at least the voices anyways . I always hear a older girl talking usually , couple words each time I hear anything . Besides when I had a almost full blown episode where I just constantly heard match can u hear me over and over at a 5 .  Thanks for sharing . It’s nice to be able to share this stuff wit people who can relate and understand . Ps now here’s a question for you . Did your illness start suddenly at a high volume ? Or was it really low voices? For me still find it hard to believe I have schizophrenia bc how low the voices are . I can’t have conversations with them so idk . But everything connects and doc says I have it so aye Z btw bless everyone here best of lucks on covid 19"
schizophrenia,fmhc3hd,t3_fv8xsp,1586074130.0,"I don’t really suffer from schizophrenia yet . I’ve had the voices part of the onset start months ago , but I do suffer from anxiety big time to the point I’m bed ridden too afraid of everything bc of the uncomfortableness I feel when I leave home . So I do know what it’s like is what I’m saying bc I had people say that to me for anxiety . People can’t take it seriously unless they have been through it . Specially when it comes to schizophrenia, it can be very hard to know what it’s like . Even for me I can’t imagine what it’s like having schizophrenia at a disabling state intill I reach that . Basically fuck everyone don’t listen nor try to pay attention . If they can’t be bothered to listen or to try to understand fuck em . Keep your head high brother . And best of luck on staying safe for the virus , I say this for everyone reading bless everyone ❤️"

schizophrenia,fky9vk4,t1_fkxpg8j,1584644518.0,Thanks for sharing ❤️ the visuals seem like they would be scary af ;( I’m glad you don’t hear that much theese days like before but I really hope the visuals can lower too . Appreciate the share ! :)
schizophrenia,fky9kov,t1_fkxmw5h,1584644348.0,"Thanks for sharing ❤️was very hard to read because it’s actually really sad ;( I feel for you man , I can’t say I totally understand what that is like my prayers go out to you for your future . And I’m really curious , by the end of this story you shared , how you doing now ? Are you managing a lot better now ?  And thanks for the pills advice , it was hard to take at first bc I thought they would kill me but I’m mainly taking it for anxiety now as motivation because my doc says it helps it too . Taking abilify but idk I don’t think it’s gonna help the anxiety disorder I got because they basically ignored my cry for help as soon as they diagnosed me for schizophrenia. And as for the music you was talking about , I can relate a little , for me when I first got diagnosed , it triggered and episode I think ? Because at a week span of seeing the pro, the voices were more often and louder , then that’s when I noticed the water talking , then (and I only had this once well during that ep of a week) I could hear voices mimicking my music , or singing the lyrics past the actuall notes , and as like you, I eventually started hearing messages in the songs or reply’s to my thoughts . There was a point where In movies I could hear hidden messages like as if the director made a mistake on audio editing . But lucky for I can listen and watch YouTube since then normally . I really hope tho that your doing well and I really appreciate you sharing and reading my post ❤️"
schizophrenia,fkwzezb,t1_fkwz3lz,1584612664.0,"Yeah I get you :) and atm I Believe you 100% that what I hear is imagination or illness related . I’m sure soon enough I’ll fall back down but I’ll always remember this so ty ❤️ I don’t know what you mean about the unknown tho , but I’ll just add , ghosts are 100% real tho , I just don’t know what happens after life , it doesn’t end that’s for sure but idk what I’m saying sorry xD thanks again buddie :)"
schizophrenia,fkwz76m,t1_fkwwkxg,1584612397.0,"Thank you for sharing brother ❤️ that is good advice really , I just realized I hear more when I’ve been stressed , and a 7 holy cow that would be scary ;( the loudest I’ve gotten I think was 9 which was only once , it was night time and when I opened my door to the pitch blackness I heard a little girl laugh for aprox , 2 secs .

schizophrenia,fkwya9s,t1_fkwxls7,1584611235.0,Hard not too tho because started hearing voices for about a week after messing around with talking with the dead (besides child hood when I sometimes heard stuff) I even have a picture of one of the ghosts from the house. It was watching me . Idk if I can send pictures on this app but if I can I’ll prove it . But I keep trying to tel myself that what I’m hearing is just my imagination.
schizophrenia,fkwxfrn,t1_fkwwrb9,1584610150.0,Thanks for the reply ❤️ I hope your able to manage now ;(

schizophrenia,fk8ydnw,t1_fk8sj6j,1583965181.0,Well I am glad that’s how you used to feel and not anymore :) ty for everything :) and there’s no reason for my anxiety other then it being due to a disorder so it will be like that for life same for the voices just need the right pills :)
schizophrenia,fk8qpsk,t1_fk8pqyc,1583961094.0,"Thanks a lot 🙏 well for me it’s when I go outside I feel like I’m being watched constantly , ever since grade 9 which is first year of high school for where I live I started having anxiety issues that after few years basically disabled me . But I did used to hear things in the past when I had this anxiety but they always went away so I guess it just really started to begin around age 21 . And it doesn’t really help that when I was younger I used to do evp’s with my phone (talking to the dead ) I even have a picture of a ghost watching me and I think all that plus my child hood just builds into this . It just sucks imagining the future bc at 22 I honestly still feel like a baby. I’m matture and able to be alone but what if when I’m truly alone , bills , food , everyone I know dies idk what would happen because I don’t even think I can take care of myself due to anxiety . Sorry idk what this rant is hahaha xD basically I think I’m fine rn but if I do really have it then I guess In a year it might peak to its max or sooner"
