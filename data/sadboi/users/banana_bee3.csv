Is she going through snark account followers? Tbh a little bummed, I unfollowed awhile ago but I always dreamed I get blocked after a comment lol"

AnimalCrossing,fq2e8yh,t3_geqei3,1589055297.0,"Possible scam attempt? I just had two unknown visitors try to come to my island and I’m very confused.

I only have two best friends/friends (who I know in real life) on animal crossing but today I had two different visitors appear on my island. 

I visited another player via Dodo code to sell turnips (met using the turnip trade reddit community) and when I returned to my island and had my character standing just outside of the airport I saw the “flight information” screen pop up and a player named Sprout (can’t remember the island name) walked out right next to my character- then the “Someone is on their way to your island” message appeared! I panicked after hearing about others having their island invaded and powered my whole switch off. Luckily I had just travelled so everything was saved and when I turned it back on things were back to normal.

I’m confused why this happened and worried I did something wrong? I didn’t open my gates for visitors and have never had anyone but my two friends visit. They arrived so quickly after I got back from the other island (Sprout was not the person I visited to sell turnips), could they have somehow piggy backed and gotten in even if I didn’t open the gates?

Has anyone else had this happen? Does anyone have an idea why this would happen? I feel very uncomfortable that someone was able to find my island and visit with no warning."

1) I bought one to play- never played before but it’s so fun and I wanted to get involved in what everyone was talking about!

2) I loooove decorating and am trying to give each part of my island a “theme”- pirates, art, Central Park, etc. Getting all the DIYs together is the slowest part for me

3) Not a villager of mine but Moose the Mouse is on my roommate’s island and we dislike him for his attitude.

4) probably like 8 hours a day. This is my job now that I’m out of work from quarantine lol. (So like........ almost 300?)

Thank you!!"

I got into all the fan reviews and felt like I missed stuff- and think I paid more attention to the Flint/Silver/Guthrie side of things and this time I’m picking up a lot more on what’s going on with Vane/Rackham/Bonny/Max plot and it’s amazing.

Idk how I’ll ever watch another show, too....
