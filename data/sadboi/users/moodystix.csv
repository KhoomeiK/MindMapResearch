I don't like making this comment about myself, but I really resonated with the parts of guilt and shame you were going through when you were young. I've had a porn addiction for years because I found porn when I was 10 years old, my parents never supervised me. I was a neglected child, and I don't know if blaming them for that because I still love my parents. I felt so awful for tearing my hymen and them sending me to a gynecologist so they can perform a revision on my ""whorelike"" vagina, as I used to call it. Each night I prayed to god for him to give me my hymen back. I pleasured myself all the time, I never stopped. We had issues at home, poverty and family issues. I became disgusted with sex and my body until my ex came, and he made me do (actually groomed me) to do sexual stuff with him I didn't want to do. He knew my trauma. I didn't consent to giving him a blowjob the first time and it sickens me how stupid I was to let it happen (I was 16). Now he's gone and I'm feeling better every day, but my libido is gone and I still hate sex. I want a way out of this.
