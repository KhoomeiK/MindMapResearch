offmychest,fqp8sno,t3_gjzxx1,1589539093.0,"Mental illness is fucking horrible for everyone involved. When I was 14, I had a boyfriend who had really severe mental health problems. He was so sick. He couldn't find relief and it was so hard to just stand by and watch, even just at 14. He hung himself on our half year anniversary  and his death changed me.

At first, I just wanted to join him. For the first few years, I was just filled with regret and guilt and shame. I then became the hard person to be around. I had my own suicide attempts that I'm lucky to have survived. 

I'm at a point where I figure life has fucking sucked to this point,  and I'm ready for it to not suck. Recovery is hard as hell but I just never want to see a look on someone's face like how that husband had, and I never want to make a partner feel like how I did.

You make sure that you get yourself some counseling, okay? You don't need me to tell you that you see some fucked up things and this clearly stuck with you. She is sick and may try again, but you did everything you could to keep her healthy, safe and alive. Thank you for that. You did all that you could do, even if you felt like you may have wanted to somehow do more.

You take care of yourself. Thank you for all you do."

Vent,fknvhqj,t3_fjjn9g,1584374772.0,"For about all of my 22 years of life, I felt the same. I grew up in an abusive home, I experienced the loss of 4 close family members  before the age of 12, and when I was 14 I had a boyfriend who died by suicide. All of that just fucking shattered me, you know, I hated being alive because it was just suffering. 

But every time I attempted suicide (there were many times), I just couldn't go through with it or I guess I didn't give enough effort. When I would swallow fistfuls of sleeping pills, there was a huge aura of disappointment when I woke up the next morning but a little bit of me was relieved. Things sucked for a really long time.

I don't disagree with you, man. All of my life was just so painful and if I couldn't experience happiness, I just wanted it to go away. I wanted it all to stop. But I guess because we're hard wired to you know, not die, I was stuck with being alive. When I was around 20, once I started to leave the very abusive environment I lived in, I began to adapt a mind set of ""well, some stuff is fun, so maybe I'll try to find more and see if I can feel less shitty so if I gotta be alive, it doesn't suck so much"".

I started to really dissect my life. I do all the time. I look at what happened to make me who I am, and I try to predict what I can do with that. Can I help others? I dunno. Can I get better? Can I be happy? I think so. So I just started... trying to be happy? I just didn't want that pain and hurt anymore.

I sound like a hippie or someone who's like ""just don't be sad"". That's not what I'm saying at all. Your opinion is valid and honestly right, there's so much that sucks. And you know that you ""can't"" die yet, it would hurt your loved ones. You didn't come here asking for advice, so I'm really sorry I'm just throwing this all at you. You just remind me a lot of myself when I was really depressed. 

You're being realistic, and I think you can apply that realism and maybe start looking at stuff that isn't so shitty. Lots of people lie and steal and hurt you, but I mean, it feels pretty good when you can paint a pretty picture or build a desk by yourself or organize/decorate your own apartment. Yeah these things are trivial, though i had huge expectations for what was supposed to make me happy and every time I couldn't fulfill them, I sank deeper. But I just started looking at really small things, like I think red looks good on me, so I wore it more as I like the color and whenever i catch a glimpse of my shirt I'm kinda happy. I know it sounds stupid, but it makes having to be alive easier and more enjoyable. 

I hope that you can find joy in things. I think you're incredibly intuitive and intelligent, and I hope you know I'm not meaning to  discredit your life experience. Like I said, you just remind me of me, and  I hope you can maybe pet a dog and enjoy how their fur feels or bask in how happy they are to be pet by you. Dumb crap that like makes it easier having to exist."

I'm in Canada but the shoppers drug mart near me has them, they natural orange flavor is LIT 

I think he is showing concern. We mostly share sweets so I think he's just like ""honey, you gotta be healthy, but also you didn't save oreos, so that makes me sad""

It bugged me more yesterday but i kinda get his perspective. Not ideal but he isnt a therapist so I cant really complain  lol."

EUGENIACOONEY,fkcytsz,t1_fjh1m5a,1584064315.0,"She has been beaten into a position of submission since birth. She was repeatedly disrespected, neglected, blamed, and mistreated by her family. All Eugenia knows is trying to keep the peace so someone doesn't explode at her for something she didn't do. She was taught that standing up for herself made her ""mean"", I almost guarantee her Mother made a threat against herself when Eugenia even tried it. That enough was to scare Eugenia into thinking she cant stand up for herself because people get hurt and it would be her fault. 

So she let's things happen to her. She takes blame, she takes the beating, because anything that even looks like she *might* be thinking about retaliating, gets punished and I'm certain its severely. All she knows is walking on eggshells and the word ""no"" doesn't get to be used by her."
