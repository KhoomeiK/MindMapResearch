Coronavirus,fq8m20x,t1_fq8hkjg,1589169409.0,"This woman did literally what you’re advocating for and she died. Her death may not have been acute/immediate (I.e. run to a burning car to pull out a victim when you have no protection) but her  actions resulted in her death. A patient codes and isn’t breathing and you have 2 choices: go in and save them, or take AT LEAST 3 min to don your proper PPE (assuming it’s been provided, which it isn’t in all situations) and hope they haven’t died yet. Of course as a nurse who has been treating patients for 40 years (just guesstimating, the woman was 61) is going to rush in on a code blue. 

All I’m saying is a code blue is pretty immediate danger for the patient. We all know victim blaming is a thing but god damn."

Alternately, Costco has these Kirkland “sparkling” drinks that are the generic version of the Sparkling Ice carbonated flavored water. They’re super dangerous cuz they’re way sweet and totally hide the taste of vodka. When I drink those I usually only need 1 because of how strong I can make it."
