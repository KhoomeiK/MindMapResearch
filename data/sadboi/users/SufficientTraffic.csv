Sort of a ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just a victim, there‚Äôs no hope for me, I‚Äôm broken, there‚Äôs no point trying‚Äù etc etc.  Abuse does predispose people to adopt a victim attitude in everyday life, so it seems calloused to me to shame people for that response.

Also, if resources from websites for ptsd help you, it‚Äôs perfectly fine to use those resources even if you‚Äôre not sure you have it.  You‚Äôre harming no one by accessing those resources, and if it helps you, that‚Äôs a win for everyone.  You don‚Äôt have to feel like a fraud."

I‚Äôm so sorry you‚Äôve experienced this too, but it‚Äôs nice to know I‚Äôm not alone.  ‚ÄúSad‚Äù was dangerous growing up - it would escalate most of the time, or yeah, it would mean borderline suicidal.  Emotions in general were dangerous - you were either happy(or pretending
to be) or things were bad.  So getting used to a scenario where emotions other than perfectly happy are okay has been....a process.  It goes the other way around too - I get scared to tell him *I‚Äôm* sad because I don‚Äôt want him to freak out about it, then I get confused when he takes it in stride.  He‚Äôs promised me before that he‚Äôd tell me if anything was wrong, and I trust him, so I try to just hang onto that promise when I‚Äôm feeling super anxious.  It doesn‚Äôt always work, though.
