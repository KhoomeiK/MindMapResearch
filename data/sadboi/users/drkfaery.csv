personalfinance,fk89z7a,t1_fk898rg,1583952136.0,He has excellent benefits and time off. He would definitely be making more with cut hours then unemployment. I would tell him to find a hospital hospitality job but he has diabetes which is high risk for him to get it so I don't want to expose him. I guess I will just go with my gut. If everyone else leaves he is sure to have job security. Hmmmm thanks for giving me things to think about. I think him hinting at his seniority is a good sign.

DirtyDave,fk7k7mx,t3_fgnke6,1583938157.0,I am sure this is due to the criticisms he had recently over his comments about the tornadoes and such.

Shelter, food, love....is all she needs. Plus all the other advice I have seen, due to the situation you may qualify for help in many areas for raising this child. I am cheering for you!

Also you don't need to spend a lot of money on clothes and toys. Consignment stores, FB Marketplace, craigslist. Never pay full price. Carters online has amazing sales on clothes. They grow out of toys and clothes so fast. You may also have friends/family to pass stuff on to you. Remember kids need love not things"

DaveRamsey,fk1xqtf,t1_fk1xc5a,1583788975.0,"See this is what people always say however my husband and I do very job specific things. We would probably have to go back to school to do something else. He is a chef at a hotel and I am a Veterinary technician (like an RN for people but I do more). 

I could maybe get paid a dollar or two more but would definitely lose out in the long run because of the good benefits and paid time off. 

Super afraid of taking on college debt as I see how people are suffering with loans. I could probably pay cash for college but my money would be gone.

Now my husband probably could find another job, however for him it is definitely not a good time to be looking!"
