Recently China accused India that India's new investment rules violate WTO's principles, but a little digging up led to the conclusion that it's totally legit. The rules conform to WTO's guidelines. Now, WTO was formed to allow free trade and pamper cross-cultural relations and diversification, thus promoting globalisation. But allegations like these really deteriorates relations between countries and it affects business on a large scale. This is why I asked the question. What's WTO even doing?"

Sleeping will result in waking and waking up will result in why did I wake up? I don't want to.  I can't sleep because it'll bring tomorrow and  tomorrow is no good.  I don't want to sleep because tomorrow's always a chore. I don't want to sleep because tomorrow is always miserable, it's always the same. Everyday when it comes around the time I should sleep I don't because I feel I'm not tired enough and I've not done anything fruitful throughout the day. Sleeping makes me more tired than staying up all night, than before I got in bed. How can I be so tired yet don't go to sleep? I would rather be gaming or music or watching stuff. It feels good and comfy in the night and nobody else is here. Sleeping causes dreams and I dream something I can never ever achieve in life, so again it brings all that melancholic feelings upon me. So, I don't want to sleep. I want to stay awake as long as possible, not doing anything productive. I don't want to go to sleep knowing I'll wake up in the morning having to go to a place I don't want to, where I don't belong and see people and do something I don't want to or like to. I don't want to do anything at all but I don't want to not do anything either.
I have heard it from people (probably you'll think or say that too) that's it all in my head which is a result of sleep deprivation, but believe me it's not. It's not that. I really can't explain how and what I feel like.  I just feel really uncomfortable."
