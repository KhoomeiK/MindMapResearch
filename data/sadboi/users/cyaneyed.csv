Sure, so..
change is hard
being a teen is hard and
being a teen girl is hard
giving up privacy is really hard
being forced to is really hard

However... being a teen girl without parents, who has been abused, probably beaten, possibly raped is much much much harder.

Life isn’t perfect for anyone, but think of it like, you’re riding in a car on the road of life. The new girl is hungry, cold, standing in the rain, walking alone.

Making room and being crowded in the car is a little inconvenient, but you’re saving the other girl’s life. You’re raising her up to be warm and safe and it will take a long time for her to trust that she won’t be hurt or booted out of the car like others have done before.

You didn’t ask for a new sister, but she didn’t ask to have her life destroyed and to be hurt and alone and put in this position.

When you are 18, you can leave and get a job or go to school and live alone (if you can afford it), but until then, try to imagine how it would feel if you had been so hurt, neglected and abused by your own parents that you had to be taken away? Really feel it. Imagine not having enough food day after day or being raped or beaten just for existing.

Work on that empathy.

This change may be difficult for you, but it is a very good and kind thing. Do your best."
AmItheAsshole,fpnb8aj,t3_ge7xqy,1588756723.0,"YTA The mother of your child is entitled to have love in her life. People move all the time. 

Daughters absolutely need their moms or close female role models, it is extremely important during childhood and puberty.

Children need a mom who make a big deal over little boo boos and are there to safely talk to and cuddle with without worry about image. No man I’ve ever known personally has the empathy to distinguish between happy screams and pain-filled yells. Most men I know universally hate the super-high pitched squeals and screams of happy children playing. Women’s hearing literally changes once they have kids to better distinguish sounds of distress in babies/toddlers.

Then, later, I’m sorry but men, while loving and sympathetic, don’t understand how devastating puberty can be on a woman’s body and mental image.

It’s not just the body changing, bleeding (needing to pay attention to diet to not pass out during this time) and hormones that change you from a confident kid to an acne-covered, depressed self-hating transitioning adult, but dealing with unwanted attention from boys and men of all ages, when to be subtle and when not to be, ugh bra shopping, exploring the need for love but not understanding it’s not the same as the shallow pressure for sex.

There are 100s of different social and physical issues that come up. Learning that it’s okay to cry frequently, that your emotions are still valid, even if you’re upset because of hormones. Learning how to wash blood out of everything. Learning that you bleed even while sleeping so it’s a good idea to sleep in some light fabric, black, shorts on top of underwear. Learning to keep changes of jeans and underwear in your locker when you’re inevitably surprised by a period starting with what feels like a shot glass full of blood coming out of you while you’re in the middle of doing something else.

Dealing with other girls being cruel or making comparisons, being left out because you’re not cool anymore, learning not to be shy about going to planned parenthood without any shame or fear, because a woman needs to be proactive and confident to control whether she gets pregnant or not and to get frequent examinations before but especially after becoming sexually active.

Some women get frequent UTIs. A mother who also had them can replace fear with understanding. The pain of them is unbelievable.

Taking a daughter away from her mom is incredibly cruel to your daughter, not just the mom."

CatAdvice,fnykdwv,t3_g4i8lh,1587365821.0,"My kitties are indoor-outdoor cats. They are mostly shy but one of them would walk into any neighbor’s house if he thought there were snacks.

(Side note, All of my kitties have chips, collars, gps trackers and know where home is and they know I’ll always let them in for breakfast if they don’t come back before I go to sleep/shut the door.)

Now that said, I agree with another poster, feral cats are almost another species. They weren’t raised to look at human faces to receive food, pets and treats, it’s unlikely they’d walk in unless they were still a baby/less than a year old.

You may want to take a photo and post a “found” flyer around the mailboxes to see if anyone is missing it.

If a kitty comes around often and seems very skinny, sometimes people move and just leave their pet cat behind, but if it’s well fed, clean and happy, it may be a neighbor’s and just lost it’s collar.

What I wanted to point out is this though, my cats walk around and explore on average about 5 miles a day. They love to be outside unless it’s raining or cold and when that happens they stare out windows until they fall asleep. They come home often during the day for a bite and a nap (and cuddles) then go for another walk. They are creatures of habit and they know where food and love come from.

If your kitty is used to being independent.. when you lock it in an apartment and keep it as an “indoor only” cat, it really won’t understand, especially if there is another family to go to.

You’ll need to play with it constantly, hide cat treats around the house, really do a lot to keep it stimulated and tired enough that it doesn’t mind napping at “home”.

You may want to get a harness/vest and take it out for walks because outside makes him happy.

There’s no need to be upset. It sees outside as home as much as your place. The kitty will be fine. It just may take some time to adjust.

You can get a spray bottle of water and spray the kitty and yell NO! When it crowds you at the door trying to get out, but that may make it want to get out even more, not understanding why you’re punishing it.

When it’s very late, or I know it will rain or snow and I come in with my hands full I yell back back back and use my foot to block the door, but they’re also old enough now to spend a night outside and know everything is fine.

Best of luck. Don’t worry if it “escapes”. It will be back like always."
