New York asked the same thing last week and got the same response.
MomForAMinute,fkykem8,t3_fl3lfk,1584650487.0,"I work in a public health dept in the WIC program. I’m not a medical professional, but I work with a lot of them. There have been no confirmed cases within 50 miles of me, but I have been in a state of panic/anxiety for about a week now. I’m not sleeping well. I’m snappy. They limited the amount of people coming in the health department, but I’m still freaking out because what if someone does bring it in? We also have home health nurses. They could spread it. I don’t want to bring it home to my kids and my parents and in-laws.

 Plus, my boss is the Public Health Coordinator leading the testing protocol, and she’s stressing everyone the fuck out. The atmosphere of my office is tense, which is just feeding my anxiety. 

Yesterday, she offered to let me take my eventual lay-off early. Someone had informed her that I’m not comfortable working with the potential threat of COVID. I felt a little betrayed, but I felt relief, too. I started my lay-off today. It just sucked that in the 2 hours I worked, my supervisor and the other nurses had to keep talking about how people need to realize this isn’t a big deal and basically made me feel like a drama queen. But after I walked out, I cried from relief. 

I’m not sure why I felt the need to post this, but I guess I needed to get it out. The world is scary right now. You’re not the only one feeling it."

We had a our judge kind of screw us over, although it was our lawyer/car loan bank’s fault. The bank we had our car loans through didn’t file their claims in time, so when they did, the trustee objected to the untimely filling. This is how I realized that the bank hadn’t filed their claims. My lawyer hadn’t caught it. So they quickly filed on the banks behalf. The trustee told my lawyer that when this happens, they will object to it, it goes in front of the judge, the judge overrules it, and it gets added to our payment plan. Well, for some reason, our judge didn’t. She wouldn’t include it. The trustee nor the bank had ever seen this happen. Lucky us. But the bank let us continue paying the cars outside of the plan, so we could keep the cars. This was nice because we hadn’t made a payment on them since we had filed our chapter 13. So we’re caught up on that and should pay them and the chapter 13 off around the same time. 

So good things can come out of all this mess! Good luck, and I hope you get good news! Reach out if you ever have questions or just need to vent to someone who’s going through the process!"

It sounds like your attorney isn’t the most competent. You’re not supposedly to be living lavishly while in chapter 13, but you should be able to make ends meet. I hope your lawyer can amend your payments to make them more reasonable. This is no way to live."

He gets more restful sleep. I get sleep. The machine is silent. I hope your husband follows through with the appointment and gets something done.
