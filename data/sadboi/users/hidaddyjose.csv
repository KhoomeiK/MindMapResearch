ArtistLounge,fq5mefr,t3_ggskr4,1589110816.0,"I'm currently at college to be an Art Teacher. I'd say it's entirely possible to learn most everything you need from skillshare and YouTube. In fact, you could likely learn everything you need just by doing masterstudies. The biggest obstacle for most people is putting in the work. I work best in a classroom environment. But if you have the intrinsic motivation to learn and practice art on your own, then all the better.

That being said, I'd also highly recommend researching some art history. smarthistory.org is a great resource. The Art Assignment YouTube channel is also pretty great. When I took a class on it my professor told me it's good to understand how problems were solved in the past and how those solutions have lead us to where we are today. It's helped me a lot more than I thought it would and is rarely touched on by the average YouTuber.

I'd also recommend a few different ways of practicing. Of course, the most common advice is to draw regularly. Experiment and such. This will develop your technique, and as it develops I urge you to be mindful of incorporating those techniques into your practice. Another thing I'd recommend practicing is idea generation. Creativity can be learned and improved. By drawing up a few thumbnail sketches and developing an idea on a regular basis you will become more comfortable and confident in the creative choices you make. Similar to how you'd experiment with different drawing techniques.

At least, that's what works for me. Good luck!"
selfhelp,fpyryjl,t3_gg2hu4,1589008426.0,"I might have an idea to build on that.
About a year or so ago I started working out in a very similar way to how you suggest here. I had a broad goal to simply be active everyday. Whether that meant weight lifting, yoga, cardio, basketball, cycling, or whatever. I tried to make sure I did something everyday. Overtime I've gotten a much better idea as to what works for me and I've learned a lot about how to workout more specifically to get the results I want.

Since the pandemic I've obviously been limited in my options and have begun focusing primarily on bodyweight exercises I can do at home. Since I'm forced into a more specific type of workout I've begun to delve deeper into proper technique. Doing a proper push-up, crunch, pull-up, exc.

What I've realized is that even though overall I'm putting out less reps on any given exercise, by being mindful of proper technique I'm actually able to gain a lot more (and be safer in the long run).

I think this approach could be a good analogy for other areas as well. To get as much output as possible while still being mindful and aware of any techniques that you learn along the way.
Kinda reminds me of ""perfect practice makes perfect"".

Though, I might prefer something along the lines of ""thoughtful practice produces thoughtful work"" or something like that.
Of course, I'm mostly past the initial stage of experimentation and finding out what works for me and what doesn't."

depression,fonyjnx,t3_g8eq07,1587929002.0,"About a month or so ago my best friend killed himself. I can't imagine what it's like for you and I'm sorry that you're going through this. It's hard for me because so many things in my life remind me of him. From songs, to certain streets, to video games. When he died I thought of a post I'd seen a long time ago. I think it's helped me a little bit. After reading your story I went to find it and found someone who quoted u/GSnow:

Alright, here goes. I'm old. What that means is that I've survived (so far) and a lot of people I've known and loved did not. I've lost friends, best friends, acquaintances, co-workers, grandparents, mom, relatives, teachers, mentors, students, neighbors, and a host of other folks. I have no children, and I can't imagine the pain it must be to lose a child. But here's my two cents.

I wish I could say you get used to people dying. I never did. I don't want to. It tears a hole through me whenever somebody I love dies, no matter the circumstances. But I don't want it to ""not matter"". I don't want it to be something that just passes. My scars are a testament to the love and the relationship that I had for and with that person. And if the scar is deep, so was the love. So be it. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are a testament that I can love deeply and live deeply and be cut, or even gouged, and that I can heal and continue to live and continue to love. And the scar tissue is stronger than the original flesh ever was. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are only ugly to people who can't see.

As for grief, you'll find it comes in waves. When the ship is first wrecked, you're drowning, with wreckage all around you. Everything floating around you reminds you of the beauty and the magnificence of the ship that was, and is no more. And all you can do is float. You find some piece of the wreckage and you hang on for a while. Maybe it's some physical thing. Maybe it's a happy memory or a photograph. Maybe it's a person who is also floating. For a while, all you can do is float. Stay alive.

In the beginning, the waves are 100 feet tall and crash over you without mercy. They come 10 seconds apart and don't even give you time to catch your breath. All you can do is hang on and float. After a while, maybe weeks, maybe months, you'll find the waves are still 100 feet tall, but they come further apart. When they come, they still crash all over you and wipe you out. But in between, you can breathe, you can function. You never know what's going to trigger the grief. It might be a song, a picture, a street intersection, the smell of a cup of coffee. It can be just about anything...and the wave comes crashing. But in between waves, there is life.

Somewhere down the line, and it's different for everybody, you find that the waves are only 80 feet tall. Or 50 feet tall. And while they still come, they come further apart. You can see them coming. An anniversary, a birthday, or Christmas, or landing at O'Hare. You can see it coming, for the most part, and prepare yourself. And when it washes over you, you know that somehow you will, again, come out the other side. Soaking wet, sputtering, still hanging on to some tiny piece of the wreckage, but you'll come out. Take it from an old guy. The waves never stop coming, and somehow you don't really want them to. But you learn that you'll survive them. And other waves will come. And you'll survive them too. If you're lucky, you'll have lots of scars from lots of loves. And lots of shipwrecks."

The study I think of is one I heard of a long time ago where employers were less likely to give people with black names an interview. What I wondered is what these employers would say if you asked them if they were racist. Likely, they'd say they weren't. Yet, the bias is still there.

And that if we don't recognize that we have these prejudices and stereotypes about other races then it can only make things worse.

Also, I was giving examples of other groups that people are apart of that are effected similarly. Sexism and Racism are similar just with different groups. And Nationalism is essentially the same mentality except you're prioritizing the people of your nation (though I'm specifically thinking of how Americans only care about people dying in other countries if the person dying is an American).
