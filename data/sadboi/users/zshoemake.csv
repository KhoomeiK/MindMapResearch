dogs,fhv97gy,t1_fhv8unl,1581894744.0,"It’s tough. I appreciate you not judging me lol. I’ve had dogs my entire life, but they’ve all aged gracefully and then boom a serious problem like cancer and it’s a quick decline. These 2 chihuahuas are resilient as hell and their aging process has been slow, regardless of the aggravating aspects of having a couple of senior dogs. I could easily see them both living another 3-6 years"

MMA,fh22vgc,t1_fh22g2b,1581232767.0,You know I honestly have no idea what these judges are looking at. My experience watching mma has been a challenger in a championship fight has to make it undeniable if he wants a decision victory. It’s happened time and time again
MMA,fh22r13,t1_fh22n2b,1581232620.0,You’re mad bro take it easy.
MMA,fh22q5e,t1_fh22jvl,1581232592.0,I thought Reyes did very well moving around and essentially taking Jones leg kicks out of the game plan. The main thing he was lacking was a pure connection on a punch or kick in his flurries
MMA,fh22cpe,t1_fh228rl,1581232137.0,All Reyes had to do was push forward in 3-5 and he would’ve won. He backpedaled and in whatever twisted way these judges score fights they sway toward fighters who control the cage and give constant pressure.
MMA,fh228y9,t1_fh22761,1581232014.0,If you think I’m wrong you must be new to watching mma. Don’t leave it in the hands of the judges
MMA,fh227bh,t1_fh223cw,1581231962.0,"People are too emotionally involved lol. I am 100% a Jon Jones fan. I was worried he was gonna lose this fight, but once I saw Reyes backpedaling I thought he might have a chance on the cards. When I saw Reyes not even try and fight at the end of the 5th at all - I knew Jones had won the cards"
MMA,fh223nt,t1_fh21zyz,1581231843.0,"He thought in his mind he had it won too. He didn’t even try and bang at the end of the 5th. Fight until it’s over, he’ll learn from that mistake"
MMA,fh21z6n,t1_fh21ygc,1581231698.0,"True, and took off the entire 4th and 5th"
MMA,fh21vji,t3_f14nmn,1581231586.0,If Reyes maintained his pressure rounds 3-5 he would’ve won. He gassed out and you can’t backpedal for 2 rounds in a championship fight as a challenger and expect a decision.
MMA,fh21j6d,t1_fh21c1j,1581231199.0,If we took a shot every time Cruz said championship rounds we’d be fuckin hammered right now

hiphopheads,fgy1vx7,t1_fgy1jiq,1581178638.0,Yea that’s kinda what I was thinking. There’s a lot of endless arguments about white artists that start off hip hop and then go off and do something else like rock or country - and they get slapped with a culture vulture label. Riff Raff - as ridiculous as his character is - is a full send as far as being committed to being a rapper and just that.
hiphopheads,fgy0yz5,t1_fgy0m99,1581178370.0,Lol not trying to be a dick but I’ve been seeing a lot of Post Malone is a culture vulture type discussions and it made the think about Riff Raff.

science,f48dciz,t1_f48bi5m,1571436715.0,"100% yes. There were neighborhoods were walking down the street got you frisked, searched, questioned. I was arrested at lunch in front of my whole school for throwing a hat on the floor in an argument over me not giving it to the assistant principal demanding I give it to him. I was charged with “threatening and intimidating a public official.” Idk if I would say I have ptsd, but there were kids who went through way more bs than me and I would assume that none of us are 100% ok with the experiences that we all shared"
science,f488jt6,t1_f46erby,1571434283.0,"My high school had an SRO, with no counselors, nurse, or social worker. The SRO’s name was Big House, and the rumor was he was put into the school rather than regular police work because he was a drunk. The school had every problem a school can have, gangs, drugs, violence, underfunded, high turnover rate of staff... We didn’t have lockers, had a gang related dress code (no bandanas, certain color shirts, a specific jacket, etc.), had to carry clear or mesh book bags, and didn’t have lockers. There were over 1000 freshman, and less than 150 seniors each year. One of my classes almost every kid was on probation for criminal charges outside of school, including myself. Idk why I felt the need to say all this, but I relate to this article in those ways."
