I ended up getting antiks with a high-top boot and got ankle braces, as well. My skates are similar to the ones linked below (I think mine were the previous model). The boot is made of leather. I haven't had a problem hurting my ankles since. 

I just ordered Moxi Lolly's, which are suede high-tops. I'm honestly quite confident my ankles will be fine with the suede and my ankle braces. I haven't tried yet, though, so I can't be 100% sure. I believe if you were to not have ankle braces, you would need a stiffer boot. I imagine the braces do the job that the stiff boot does, if not better.

One thing is that he is referencing Sigmund Freud's psychoanalytic theory and psychosexual stages of development. His work is from the early 1900s, and has since been refuted by other experts in psychology. To me, this says the author is using sources that confirm his biases. 

Another thing is the author's language, in general. Using phrases like ""so-called"" or ""it's not suprising that"" make it seem like he has an opinion. Of course, everyone does, but when writing something like this, it's important to be as objective as possible. When a person is *showing* the reader that they have an opinion, it's possible that their writing is biased.
