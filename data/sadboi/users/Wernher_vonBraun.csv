LSD,fp0xgf5,t1_fp0wzr8,1588219128.0,"Most people would say because it loses the magic yada yada. I mean everybody I know myself included kind of goes through a period of high dose-high frequency in their psychedelic exploration, before finally finding their groove. I used to do it every couple weeks but after a point I just kind of laid off a little.

There's nothing wrong with it at all, I mean it's pretty safe so no matter what you usually come out learning something. Many friends learned they should ease off a bit, many just got disinterested, some didn't."
LSD,fp0ws4g,t3_gad2x5,1588218682.0,I think it's just how it is used recreationally. In my opinion the two aren't mutually exclusive- having a good or fun time while also having a therapeutic or beneficial session.

I think you accomplished pretty well the overall sound, the instruments all tie in together and the vocals go hand in hand as well. Guitar solos dope as hell too. My only thing I'd say is that I feel sometimes the vocals are a little to highpassed/EQd to the high ends however I also understand that may just be what you were going for and has nothing to do with my preference lol.

IndieMusicFeedback,fmc11wy,t3_fuakj2,1585936904.0,"Love it. The synths supporting the vocals are rad, and the vocals are A+ as being tolerable (I actually like them). I like finding music with a good mix of guitar and other instruments without being too flooded by the distortion."

microdosing,fkerstk,t1_fkedjyx,1584119341.0,"I do agree with you on most points here. I'm very familiar with schizophrenia. Obviously the scare and hollywood mumbo jumbo is a bunch of B.S.

However, chemically, psychedelics exacerbate schizophrenia. Sometimes it's more for some than others, and often people have the willpower to pedal past that if they are able to work with their own mind well enough.

However, as far as microdosing psychedelics go, it probably isn't very good for schizophrenia. A one time psychedelic shop every now and then is risky but at the end of the day just one event. However, microdosing constantly bombards you with psychoactive chemicals that in one with schizophrenia, only stir it up even more... and it compounds.

Not saying don't  go for it, just be extremely careful brother."

Ayahuasca,fjy3gwc,t1_fjxsv6j,1583689070.0,"This is Kambo. It's chemically unrelated to aya but often done in retreats or before ceremonies. It is a frog venom applied onto a burnt spot on the skin that allows a physical release and is used to release energetic blockages in the body among others.

iamverybadass,fjxyomt,t1_fjxo2ae,1583686342.0,"Every source I've found claims that Humans don't have hierarchy like apes. Humans are also generally monogamous as we have evolved so to ensure the survival of our children.

iamverybadass,fjwqm91,t1_fjvw79e,1583643264.0,"Hate to be that guy, but primitive humans in the dawn of evolution didn't have leaders besides well, fathers and mothers. Hunter gatherers relied strongly on group cooperation and communication skills which is why humans have developed as they have. Our ability to work together cohesively as a group.

IndieMusicFeedback,fis4kyx,t1_fis1njs,1582677647.0,"LOL I apologize, spotify can be a bit cranky at times. The track linked was ""how little we know"" but any work. I appreciate the feedback. The synths and instruments are all hardware equipment. Many of them come from a kurzweil workstation but the ambient pads come from is a roland JX3P. But strings, piano, and synths to fill the spaces mostly. The ending string instrument is an appalachian dulcimer that ties into the chaotic noise.

The lyrics go as

""In our home see no care,
Down below warming skies
I do not understand 
How can we be this way"" twice for the first two verses

""Far beyond wired minds,
Giving through neuro signs,
How can we be this way,
How can you be this way"". On the last one."
IndieMusicFeedback,firaz5d,t3_f8vhbt,1582660882.0,"I think you near perfected as much as such a song can be perfected. The vocals are smooth and accompany very well.

IndieMusicFeedback,firah4h,t3_f8wbw0,1582660600.0,"I mostly like it a lot, especially the drums which I think work well with the tension and placing. My only  beef is that at points especially in the chorus the vocals seem a little thin or almost isolated- the vocals themself actually aren't bad at all however so it shouldn't be that hard to perfect."
IndieMusicFeedback,fira0d4,t1_fir9u89,1582660336.0,For sure!
IndieMusicFeedback,fir9ooj,t3_f9fh3e,1582660152.0,"On lunar, right off the bat, even though I'm not normally attracted to the cleaness of a lot of rock, I think it fits very well. The vocals kick off with a sick bass line and nice electric guitar chords I like a lot. The melodic guitar lead accompaning the verse around 1:30 or so I like, but sometimes feels it wanders a little for the common listener. Though I personally don't mind and think it adds some nice complexity. All in all, I think a really good job was done and will be following!"

Ayahuasca,fiixg3t,t1_fiix7bq,1582429361.0,"Understandable. I personally know of Peruvian and Brazilian shamans who endorse facilitators of ayahuasca retreats in natural areas in other areas too, but looking for the authentic experience is also very important.

I generally advise against solo tripping on psychedelics at high strengths which is why I reccomend ceremonies of any sort so much. They bring such a different deepness and level to it, as well as keeping you safe. Even the most put together psychonauts can sometimes have bad moments in extreme states or ego death which can lead to physical danger without ceremony ""angels"" or assistants as they're called."
Ayahuasca,fiix1rl,t1_fihjt48,1582429062.0,Also you don't have to do it in South America. There are plenty of shamans or facilitators in the states who are exceptional and have trained in South America.
Ayahuasca,figwu42,t3_f7r2u8,1582404229.0,"I know many bipolar people who have seriously been helped by ayahuasca and psychedelic medicines. With that being said you must play the safest route. Try to research as much as you can, and at the end of the day, know what you're getting into. I reccomend if doing aya with bipolar to try and take off as much time for yourself and integration as possible before jumping back into the normal world.

Of course a good facilitator is everything as well...
Just play it safe, stick with your gut."

5MeODMT,fh9rncp,t3_f20ekb,1581388043.0,"Firstly I think it's great you've found somebody to facilitate a journey.

Generally the dosage is something done on the spot in my experience, and shouldn't really be price dependent- you're paying for the facilitation rather than the medicine.

How strongly it affects you can be predicted very loosely. Things like weight for instance, aren't even very good indicators of whether somebody would have a strong trip or not. You basically have to generalize based on your own instinct. Of course, the facilitator will be going over all these issues on the spot.

As for previous trips I believe this will be a good way to help settle energies created good or bad. You won't probably have the time or the headspace to consciously work through individual trip's moments however it will help dissipate complications stirred up because in my experience it helps you see past those."
5MeODMT,fgpqj3h,t3_ezt1l5,1581010051.0,"Some people do pretty high doses, in my experience the vest threshold range is 60mg-90mg depending on how sensitive the recipient is, but can be hard to gauge. Often smaller people who are more sensitive to say marijuana, *may* be more sensitive. 100mg is a lot in my opinion, but each facilitator does their own thing.

Also, eating and diet isn't too big of an issue as it may be with say Ayahuasca. Just try to not eat a few hours or even at all after you wake up the bufo day. Of course once you do it, a good solid meal is very important.

Meditating could also be useful. Many people after feel the desire to meditate but if they haven't had experience meditating in the past, it can be mixed. So if you will want to meditate set a routine down now so you feel comfortable doing it after your experience."

DMT,fgam2vh,t1_fgaceh4,1580652855.0,"Again, that's a product of the ego, and I completely understand because I used to be 1000% like that. Now however, it is a little more than the ego. There are people that seek to take advantage in this physical realm or do bad, but having people you trust and care for is important to the experience.

I felt very similar until a 5meo experience with others and realized that I was just like them and these people I didn't even know, I felt very close to. I realized all these barriers and walls I'd put up were just my ego trying to separate myself from the people and world around."
DMT,fgac08m,t1_fg967su,1580649465.0,That's just the ego. You should try to find a way around that or be so into it it doesn't matter. Kust my two cents.
BetterEveryLoop,fg7bt1x,t1_fg7bkx7,1580588730.0,"No no and lastly, funny, but no.

The police aren't there to protect you, merely to prosecute. A fight happens in merely a few moments, police take minutes to arrive.

If somebody supports Nazism, they support the purging and destruction of my people. I'm not going to just let that slide."
BetterEveryLoop,fg7b76g,t1_fg7aw43,1580588308.0,"And how did ""the police"" respond to the Nazis threats of violence against the German Jewish population?

If you wear a Nazi swastika, you are standing up for what they did, standing up for the atrocities committed. Is that not intention to fight?"
DMT,fg7651b,t1_fg73psl,1580584906.0,Have a friend serve you. It's much easier to just focus on a good inhale and nothing else. Then after do the same for your friend. If you have cool friends that is.
5MeODMT,fg75v8i,t3_exaw6d,1580584724.0,"Maybe but not really. It will still eventually last just as long. Also, before long you'll be too gone to even continue properly vaping it. A slow steady and gradual inhale all at once filling lungs completely is the way to do it in my experience."
5MeODMT,fg4rj1h,t1_fg4r13e,1580509517.0,"Depends on the healing. Usually 5meo breakthrough results in an incredibly profound journey that is more in the long term like a jolt to our consciousness that can help us kind of re center ourselves if integration is done properly. It usually doesn't directly give you answers.

LSD gives much longer to contemplate and reason with yourself or meditate or do whatever. However on very high doses it may have diminishing returns.

And I cannot stress this enough, have someone to tend to you during 5meo journey. It is wildly important especially if you are already susceptible to LSD. They just need to be present and make sure you don't hurt yourself physically."
5MeODMT,fg4qqxo,t3_ewvu6a,1580509022.0,"There are a lot of variables at play here. How much are you doing, what way of smoking, freebase or venom, etc.

I'm guessing that if you black out on acid than you probably won't remember a thing on 5meo, but I could be wrong. 5meo is far more intense yet far shorter."
COMPLETEANARCHY,ffu4f15,t3_ev4wos,1580234263.0,Damn I thought armored and armed police at high schools was just an American thing.
5MeODMT,ffu4aab,t1_fftjmro,1580234182.0,"Just that I don't really know how to minimize the risk. Maybe being in a field or something with no hard or sharp objects, but one could still say choke on purge while on their back."
5MeODMT,ffruzo4,t3_euvnlk,1580166438.0,"There isn't a guide for solo tripping because it just isn't safe to do alone. There are so many risks that even a friend to have sit for just the hour you do it could save your life. What you do in the peak state of 5meo is wildly unpredictable, even in those who are usually completely still. It can all change."
5MeODMT,ffqqz7e,t3_euob2t,1580141608.0,"So a few points- firstly no psychedelics will really prepare you for bufo/5meodmt. I assist in ceremonies with it and people who have never done psychedelics before respond just as well to it. Think of it like this: an acid trip is much closer to being sober than an acid trip is to breakthrough 5meo.

Secondly, the best case would be to search around for a facilitator. I personally do not know of any in the UK, however, new people are always appearing or facilitators traveling places to perform these ceremonies. So try to keep your ears perked about it, ask around, etc... It isn't easy to find but isn't impossible."

shrooms,ffpksdc,t1_ffpgudr,1580097460.0,"I want to build upon more what the other comment stated. I a trip state you are in a high energy mode and ultra sensitive and aware of information you are taking in. The phone happens to have endless amounts of information, much of it gross filler, advertisements, fear based news, among others. There is just so much information and so much to access it only serves to disconnect you from yourself during a trip- which is usually the opposite reason people trip.

This is at least my experience."
5MeODMT,ffnsbma,t3_eub8gv,1580070118.0,"Maybe a little but I don't think that's the main cause. I think thrashing is generally just caused by in the moment confusion and lack of awareness in the state of ego death. Among thrashing, spitting up, rolling around, standing then falling down, and rarely grabbing at one's face may also occur on either."
5MeODMT,ffn83tg,t1_ffn7nud,1580063000.0,Usually the window of ego death and the hazy moments around it are the ones most fail to remember much from (besides maybe a few snippets) simply because the brain doesn't build memories normally in that state.
5MeODMT,ffn5bf4,t3_etyxs1,1580062166.0,"Some feel after that a complete blackout happened- however a few things. Firstly, it doesn't matter much as the ego death/soul release happened and is all that truly matters, it worked. Secondly, as said in the other comment, reactivations help progress the trip. And lastly, in consecutive journeys, it becomes more accessible."
5MeODMT,ffijzi0,t1_ffihkmu,1579975688.0,"Since bufo/5meo is so obscure it may be difficult to find things centered on that unless you have a firm knowing of the community around the facilitators etc in a particular area.

However if searching in facebook in groups maybe ""Bufo integration,"" ""5meo integration"" or just ""psychedelic integration"" for a broader and larger group I'm sure many will come up that have friendly and helpful people. I can ask those i know in the community (I'm in NYC atm) if they know anybody in that area- I'm sure they do."
5MeODMT,ffe64ac,t3_et0xtu,1579837701.0,The eclipse vaporizors do really well at least for bufo venom. The vapor genie is probably best for synthetic.
5MeODMT,ff9on1g,t1_ff9ndzt,1579717405.0,"Probably; but keep in mind synthetic or freebase is up to 5x more potent than the toad venom so adjust accordingly. And even a small amount of it can be equivelant to a very powerful mushroom trip In comparison, but only briefly."
5MeODMT,ff9du61,t1_ff9dcko,1579710853.0,Well vomiting is exceptionally rare. And a comfortable setting on an open floor space is usually the best place to do it (inhale on your knees then lay back). However that is only my suggestion.
5MeODMT,ff9cbib,t1_ff9bnlg,1579709747.0,"It depends. Sometimes people will have beautiful internal experiences but very hectic outside experiences, or lay in a very meditation like state but go through what they feel is past lives of trauma or be ravaged by emotions in a very therapeutic way. It just comes down to the person really, it can be hard to know exactly what kind ot reaction someone has, I haven't found too much of correlation to anything really.

If anything, maybe those who are articulate in their actions and stay more inside their head remain calmer, while in that moment of ego death people may become aggitated due to not knowing what is going on at all (as your reality basically has been vaporized) and frantically move around in an attempt of confusion."
5MeODMT,ff9c1i0,t1_ff9bij3,1579709541.0,"Not too sure about DMT itself but I do a lot of work with threshold doses of bufo (5meodmt) ceremonies. I think it is absolutely critical to have someone with you even on a moderate dose of 5meo simply because it is completely unpredictable what you'll do. Some people roll and flail around and yell, and when they come back, have no recollection of it. Though that isn't everybody. If your friend is interested you can always switch off, one under while one holds space and one holding space while the other is under.

Also occasionally people spit a lot of saliva up and very rarely may vomit but it isn't often.

If you are looking for a more psychedelic and less transcendent or spiritual experience, DMT is up. 5meo often blows right past the typical psychedelic effects since it really elevates to such a higher levels things like visuals just don't even matter anymore.

Lastly being alone doesn't matter for say introspection or whatnot, because under a threshold dose, you shouldn't even be aware of your surroundings or who is around you. It's just a product or the ego not wanting people around ultimately."
5MeODMT,ff9a6fd,t3_esb3jm,1579708351.0,"Doesn't much matter people often do threshold dose 5-meo with no previous psychedelic experience and have the most profound and impacting experience of their lives, being very calm during it. People who have extensive psychedelic usage often do threshold doses of 5-meo and get very aggressive in the state of ego death but still have profound experiences. They're just different. Just make sure to be in a safe setting with someone else there to prevent anything from going bad"

5MeODMT,fegwj4i,t1_fega2pw,1579104113.0,"It's also just what kind of injuries are subverted. Some people roll around and thrash, flailing their arms and legs which any part of their body can hit hard objects and get hit on (and has happened rarely. myself and others when assisting stop this). Some people frantically stand and may just fall down and could hit their head if they weren't eased back. I've had a guy once try to roll into a fire too. You never know."
5MeODMT,fdz424t,t1_fdz2rpj,1578786424.0,"I only say that as a recommended safety precaution. Beyond that, with a sufficient enough dose, it shouldn't really matter whether somebody is around holding space or not as you typically aren't in connection with the environment around. In my working with bufo however I've seen enough injuries or situations resulting even with helpers that I'd never in a million years recommend doing it alone."
IndieMusicFeedback,fdyuuj1,t3_enan7p,1578783835.0,"I like it a lot, very calm and friendly and accessible. You have a very good voice, bravo for that.

In that state people become wildly unpredictable drawing from their subconscious, even experienced users."
5MeODMT,fdycjvq,t1_fdy3vkc,1578778307.0,Well that's one way to do it. Often periods of energetic release come in that ego dissolution stage and many times aren't even remembered. However despite the lack of memory the effects are still there and very apparent.
