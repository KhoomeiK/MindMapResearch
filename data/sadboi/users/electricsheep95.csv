My mental illness used to be much worse but meds (stopped taking them a year ago) and therapy helped. However, lately, I hadn't been so sure about my therapist anymore. I think it started when she invalidated a friend's trauma response to what would be considered rape if he were a woman. She basically said it wasn't the same with men and I wasn't comfortable with that take. I decided to give her one more chance after I quit my job at the call center and she basically agreed with me when I said I felt like a spoiled child and simply suggested entry level jobs I could try. I left the office feeling humiliated and hating myself. Then covid took over and I'm without money (I'm not getting any now because I'm staying with my parents) and under lockdown, so I can't really look for another therapist. I plan to once I get a job because my parents, as great as they are with other stuff, don't really believe in therapy or mental illnesses and I feel shitty wasting their money on it."

unpopularopinion,fnu5ady,t1_fnu1u5e,1587254827.0,"It sounds like that to me, too, and a lot of women don't like it. In my native language female isn't used for humans at all, and even when referring to animals it's a very cold, scientific way of referring to them. I'd never tell someone my dog is female if they asked. I know this is true for a lot of languages other than English, but even English speakers have a problem with the word being used casually, especially since it's much more common than ""males"". 

You'd think it'd be way easier to say ""women"" than to keep replying to people who don't like being referred to that way every time you use the word. Save yourself some trouble and in the process respect women and use their preferred term."

Maybe they motivated me to work on my dreams, etc. We don't all bring the same things to the table, and although I understand how you feel, since I've been feeling the same way lately, I know it doesn't mean I care more than they do. Besides, sometimes you have to tell people what you need, even if you think it's obvious and want them to guess. Call a friend, tell them you're down.

It's funny that you mention my issues with self-worth, because for years now I've felt so good about myself, and that all ended when I started looking for a job. I love myself and I'm proud of who I am. Until I remember I'm unemployed and 25 and then everything else gets shaky. Suddenly the fact that I'm a loyal friend, that I care about people, that I can sing, and play guitar, and draw, etc seem irrelevant, because I'm not financially independent. It's this weight that takes the joy from everything else I love about my life.   


It's crazy because I don't think of other people in these terms. I couldn't care less if my friends have a job or not, I love them. I wonder if I can learn to see myself the same way."

I'm the same as you. I like to hang with friends, draw, read, write, etc. Most of those things are free or close enough to it to not matter. Lately I've decided I want to take a diving course and I'm using that as motivation because otherwise I just don't need the money enough to put myself through hell for it. 

Ideally I'd like to work as a freelancer, like have a patreon or something. It isn't easy at all, but it may be a way for those of us who have ""irrelevant"" skills to make some money."

I read books on alternative societies, I join solarpunk groups, I advocate for change, but the one thing I can't do is stop judging myself according to those same standards I disagree with. I think it's partially because it's not just my life, I'm impacting my parents' life as well. But what they spend on me is nothing and they love working to the point of not knowing what to do with themselves on days off, so even if I didn't exist they'd work. My dad has told me he'd pay 10x the money he gives me if it made all my negative feelings regarding this situation go away.

I'm sorry that some days are hard. I hope something changes and that things become easier for you. I truly believe we weren't made to work this many hours, and that your reaction is only normal. We're missing out on life because we're creating profit for someone else. It's sick."

I have several I imagine, like being on a skyscraper in the future, looking out the window, seeing flying cars and neon and listening to the distant city noise below. But sometimes that's not enough.

He was pretty unflexible on that. He was also right-wing, sexist, very conservative, while I was the opposite.

Ever since I left my parents home 6.5 years ago, my views on the world changed a lot, and became different from theirs, but I kept trying to live up to their standards. Even when I disagreed with them, I couldn't make a decision I knew they wouldn't approve. I know this is super specific but for me it was mainly about having someone tell me I'm not crazy, that my family often makes no sense and is hurtful, and that I don't have to live by their rules. That I'm intelligent enough to choose what's best for me. I learned how to say no, and endure my mom's emotional blackmail when I did so. I don't think I could have done it with just my friends support because part of my dynamic with my parents is them making me feel like my friends and I are just kids (we're around 25), naive, ignorant, etc and that their advice is superior. Having someone outside of those two groups, my therapist, really helped to give me perspective."
