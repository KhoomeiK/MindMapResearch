privacy,f4kefl0,t1_f4kcgql,1571648662.0,"Not sure where you are in the world but in Canada anyways most isp‚Äôs won‚Äôt even allow you your own equipment, you‚Äôll be assigned modems/routers with your contract that have to be returned upon termination of the contract. They are able to see all the network activity on your router including device addresses, that‚Äôs why with Shaw on their newest equipment when you login to your router it‚Äôs actually not even just your plain old 192.168.1.1 webpage it‚Äôs an actual web service, they are serving up the information  about your router including data usage, device addresses, device type, all the typical info. 

In regards to carrier software, wether you bought it from the carrier or not once it‚Äôs activated it‚Äôs downloaded and installed. Who really knows what‚Äôs in that binary blob but from experience with freedom mobile (a Shaw company - I‚Äôm seeing a pattern) once carrier software was installed my device started sending out probe requests for a SSID that was a 16 digit numeric string, thought that was pretty weird and somewhat of a privacy issue because it was easy to tell who was a freedom customer just by catching some packets with wireshark and we all had the same probes. Anyways, they did this nasty thing where whenever a Shaw hotspot was in range (and their is many) it would force a connection to it without me even realizing and 
I‚Äôd be sitting there loading webpages at dial up speed until I realized I had been connected to one of their public hotspots. Annoying behaviour for sure and no way to make it stop. Also by forcing a connection to a public hotspot Shaw is catching my MAC at that specific location which is another privacy issue. Obviously carrier software is up to no good and running tasks without us knowing the full details. Rooting and removing isn‚Äôt even a guaranteed due to functionality being broken by missing carrier modules. It‚Äôs not even just carrier software, all devices are shipped with manufacturer telemetry as well. If you‚Äôve found a way to bypass all this than good on you, but the gp won‚Äôt be taking all these measures and it‚Äôs unfortunate that they would even have to."

Well I don‚Äôt have any links I can pull up right now although I‚Äôm not arguing anything that isn‚Äôt common sense about data collection, feel free to search up data processing/collection philosophy if you want. 

Data is just an observation about something. So when I enter a search on google, observations can be made about that search ex: say google analyzed my search history, all my searches could be tokenized and a frequency analysis could be used to get a broad image of the topics of interest to me. These observations about the data we supplied are the bread and butter of internet companies, and as I said earlier this is the data we won‚Äôt be aloud to see about ourselves because it‚Äôs not ours. These observations they have made about us are indeed tied to our accounts, otherwise they would be useless. How would they be able to send us a targeted ad without this vital info? 

Google doesn‚Äôt sell user data, which is the raw data you supplied (voice/searches/emails) because it‚Äôs useless on its own, it‚Äôs a false sense of security to revel in the fact that ‚Äúthey aren‚Äôt selling my user data‚Äù when it‚Äôs worth far more to interpret this data and than sell the interpretations. Which again are of course tied to your account. 

The free analytics google ‚Äúgives away‚Äù that you are talking about is really just the primitive data that can be gleaned by anyone who owns the web server anyways, if your hosting a site go look in your raw server logs you‚Äôll see info like requests, cookies, ip addresses, etc. Google analytics just packages this up in a neat and tidy way and scores google another bonus because you‚Äôll have to put their cookies on your website to use these analytics."
privacy,ezqkwqt,t1_ezqj1bn,1568060623.0,"Lol...I know what fingerprinting is, I don‚Äôt think your getting how raw data is used. Do you really think these company‚Äôs are selling your raw data to marketers? Do you think xyz company selling yellow t shirts is buying mass search data and than sifting, sorting, analyzing it and finding customers likely to buy yellow shirts? Of course not, google/amazon/Facebook are doing that and creating bundles of profiles that can be marketed to and that‚Äôs where the value is. 

You say they only had 100mb of your data but that‚Äôs literal garbage until these company‚Äôs make something of it. Browser uniqueness aka fingerprinting is merely one of many tools to follow you around online to aid in the collection of your data that will go on for further processing."

Now we have a male in his 20s who could be assumed to have insomnia, now they can sell this profile to marketers. This is the data you will never see.
