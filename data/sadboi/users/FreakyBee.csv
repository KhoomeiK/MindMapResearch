I think we won't see any mass gatherings (concerts, sporting events, possibly church unless it's a small crowd, etc) until next year. The exceptions might be golf and maybe NASCAR w/out a crowd, as it's easier to practice social distancing with these events. We will probably start to see restrictions easing up in June a bit - healthcare clinics, hair salons, maybe restaurants? Masks will be a hot item through the end of the year, though hopefully there will be more around as time goes by. Not sure if schools will open up in the fall, or stay as distance learning. As for parks and such, you'll probably see them reopening, but you'll also see a limit on how many people allowed in. It's going to be an interesting few months. :/"

Went to Shoppers in Fairfax. They must have had a large shipment of tp & paper towels come in that morning, because it was everywhere. Lots of different brands and sizes. Shoppers also had stock in:

\- baking items (they were stocking flour and sugar when I went through)

\- lots of frozen items - veggies, pizzas, rolls, breakfast food, etc.

\- lots of cereal

\- milk - they had a good variety of all different sorts of milk, maybe 1/3rd stocked

\- some pasta, sauces, etc.

\- Lots of cheese

\- small amount of sanitizing wipes, limited to 2 per person

\- Diapers, baby wipes, baby formula...maybe half stocked

\- Lots of candy and beer/wine

Shoppers was out of most fresh food (no citrus, apples, bananas, potatoes, onions), most meat (couldn't find fresh chicken and very limited stock on ground beef/beef in general). They did have a large quantity of turkeys.

EDIT: 7-Eleven near Santini's in Oakton had milk, eggs, small quantities of wipes, deoderant, some meds, hygiene items (plus all their usual stuff) if anyone just needed to take a quick trip and didn't want to deal with the store."
