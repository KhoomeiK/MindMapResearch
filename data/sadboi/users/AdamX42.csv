You know what else he did? Yes sir I dont believe I need to say it. Anyways, I think abortions could be the first step of this country's downfall to Stalin's capitalism. I dont just see abortion is murder, I see it as something much worse to come. The communists way of coming into our country and churning it. Also, I love to look at the bright side. Imo covid is amazing, its killing people in a way that's not murder (Other than China most likely making it) and boy do we need some good old death on our hands. Sure, abortion is good for overpopulation, but it also shows how weak people are and its depressing. You know what's not depressing? I honestly dont know, mostly everything is. Its amazing how we're all going to die someday and all we do is talk about our opinions instead of be kind and do other shit right? Looking at my generation and how much depression has impacted us because of social media and humans trying to get attention. I was actually diagnosed with psychosis and it's probably the hardest thing I've ever dealt with, its leading me to suicide honestly and politics keeps me afloat somehow.
