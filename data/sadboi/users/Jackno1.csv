I get that you really want a body like a cis man.  Women don't want that.  Cis women don't want that, and trans women don't want that.  Trans women are negatively stereotyped as ""ugly"" and ""masculine-looking"", which is why cis women tend to take it as an insult.  (Obviously trans women look all kinds of ways, and so do cis women, but the *harmful stereotype* is definitely ""ugly"".).   Trans women often value being read as cis women, or as simply women without people considering ""Trans or cis?"", because being made to feel closer to a man can be dysphoria inducing, and also it's often used to treat them as men.

If you want top surgery, that's not going to make you not a woman.  I'm also on r/butchlesbians, and there are  women who get top surgery and still identify as women.  There are women who do T, sometimes low dose or limited courses.  There are nonbinary lesbians who are women and also other genders (like me) or not any binary gender, but feel like ""lesbian"" is part of where they fit.  It might be good to spend time on a variety of communities here and get to talk to people who have varied relationships with their gender.

The changes on T aren't perfectly predictable.  They vary from person to person.  Some people go low dose to get slower changes.  Some people find a limited dose of T is right for them.  Some people realize they've made a mistake and stop.  (Some of the changes on T are permanent, and don't reverse if you stop, but they come on gradually.  A month on T isn't going to have the same permanent impact as two years on T.). It'd be good to read about the different options, and get a sense of what is inevitable on T versus what you can pick and choose.  (You can't pick and choose how your body reacts to T, but you can choose things like the dosage and if you stay on indefinitely or not.)

For what it's worth, I don't feel very different.  More relaxed, and like some things that used to be a problem no longer are.  I cry less, and am less *overwhelmed* by negative emotions, but I'm still in touch with my emotions and I have cried since being on T.  My interests haven't changed.  My voice is starting to change, which makes me happy.  (Singing-wise, I was never a great singer, and I always loved doing the deep bits.  People who are more into singing have tried different things, including no-hormone transition and low-dose, which us supposed to be easier on the voice.).

I'm a bit over two months on T, and I'm seeing relatively quick changes but not huge radical ones, and I feel better.

Also, imposter syndrome around ""I want to be a man, but am I allowed to be?""  These are all things that many trans men experience.  

And there's a lot of catastrophizing narratives around being wrong.  Being mistaken about identity is only a problem if either you or the people around you make it a problem, and isn't an inherently catastrophic thing.  And medical transitioning is a serious decision, but some TERFs have been pushing narratives that make it sound scarier than it is.  Detransition is rare, and ""detransitioning when you don't want to due to money and/or safety issues"" is a lot more complicated than ""detransitioning due to being wrong about being trans"". 

Testosterone can do a lot, if you decide to go that way.  It can make for some surprising changes to how you're seen.  It takes time, but if you look at some of the timeline videos out there, a lot of trans guys have significantly changed their appearance to something that gets their gender read correctly with a lot more consistency."

Do you have a therapist who is good on trans issues?  Are you in a situation where you could feasibly get one?  If so, that can be a help.  It can also be good to journal, and just...take time noting your feelings and preferences, seeing how stable and persistent they are. 

As I said, it's not all or nothing.  It's *recommended*, if you're doing both T and top surgery, to do T first, but it's not catastrophic or impossible to do it the other way around.   T makes gradual changes over time.  It's not ""One shot and you're Buck Angel"", it's repeatedly taking another dose and getting gradual changes, some of which are permanent.  There is the option to do a limited course of T, or do lower dose for slower changes.

You don't have to push down part of your personality to be a trans man.  You don't have to fit yourself into some rigid artificial idea of masculinity.  You don't have to hold yourself to rules that you wouldn't hold other men to.

If you hit the point where you feel like your gender identity is more complex or nonbinary, that's okay to explore.  It doesn't necessarily make having transitioned a mistake.

Something that's helpful to know about detransitoning - while there *are* people who detransition and completely regret it and wish they never medically transitioned at all, that is being presented as a lot more common than it is actually is.  There are also people who've gone back to identifying as their assigned gender, while being really happy that they've medically transitioned and enjoying the physical changes.  There are also people who've gone on T and stopped again, not because they regret it or they detransitioned, but because the effects of being on T temporarily for a limited amount of time were right for them.  (Ditto people who did any combination of hormones and surgeries while choosing to not do surgeries and/or hormones.). There are people who detransition out of necessity due to lack of support, safety, and/or access to medical care, who resume transition if their circumstances allow.  (This is more common than detransitioning out of regret.). And there are a lot of people who transitioned, have been consistently happier than they would be if they hadn't, and never detransition.

I've found that a good place to follow, and helpful with ""What if I hypothetically end up regretting it?"" anxiety around transitioning, because it shows queer women having a place for people who've physically transitioned and may even be happier due to physical transitioning.

Try not to scare yourself too much with hypothetical regrets.  If you start wanting your body to change back, then you can navigate what you're comfortable doing on that front.  But if your gender identity ends up not being ""permanently and exclusively a man"", that doesn't necessarily mean your medical transitioning was a mistake."
ftm,fqxfqnt,t3_gle39f,1589731597.0,"I'm sorry to hear that.  

I wouldn't assume you can't get top surgery.  There are people who do top surgery for trans guys who can't or choose not to be on T, and for nonbinary people who might not ever be on T.

ftm,fqxfe3x,t3_glfitm,1589731424.0,"My advice:

\- Don't rush into any medical decisions you're not ready for.  If you need time to think it over, that's perfectly acceptable.   T isn't a now-or-never thing, and neither is top surgery.  Especially for minors, I think there's a tendency for people to hear stories of people who were sure at an early age and transitioned relatively young and feel like there's a deadline, or there's ""no point"" transitioning after a certain age.  *Most* trans men transitioned as adults, and *plenty* of trans guys transitioned as adults and are happy with the results.  Honestly, if you need more time to think it over and figure things out, there will still be the option of transitioning when you get older.  

\- Don't try to force yourself into a role or an identity that makes you unhappy.  That's bad for your mental health.

\- You don't *have* to settle for the gender you were assigned at birth just because it feels like you might be able to tolerate it.   A lot of people get sucked into the idea that they're only allowed to be trans if they're completely miserable as a cis person, and that's not how it works.  You can be a trans guy because you'd rather live as a gender that makes you happy than as a gender that you have to train yourself to find tolerable.  That's a perfectly acceptable choice.

\- If you can get a good supportive counselor, that can be a big help."

I think there's a lot going on that doesn't get much visibility when it comes to AFAB women and woman-aligned people with physical dysphoria, and how the best option is often something that's not widely recognized by a society that assumes if you want your body a certain way, it must mean certain things about your gender identity.
