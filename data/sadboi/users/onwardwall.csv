StarKid,fr29y56,t1_fr29rpm,1589833671.0,Yes! I’m just sifting through them now. It never even occurred to me that there might be a starkid reddit until this morning. I love this fandom.
StarKid,fr1ye3o,t3_glo5ak,1589828038.0,Holy Musical B@man is one of my favourites for humour and tone. I also love Firebringer

StarKid,fr1xzl2,t1_fr1x632,1589827837.0,"I think that’s a cool theory but I’m not convinced of it, just because of how the characters can be pretty morally gray. I mean Wiggly is “evil” by our definitions but I would like to see them play with Webby as a more “gray” godlike character. Webby sounds like a spider so I see it as a black spider spinning white silk, though ready to eat things in its web. I think the character would be a lot more fun if it’s not boiled down to just being the “good” to wiggly’s “bad”."
StarKid,fr1w4vl,t3_gm6nye,1589826929.0,Definitely. Webby was also warning Hanna about Wiggly

BipolarMemes,flcokxa,t1_flcdwxo,1585039602.0,"So true! Mania just makes me realize I can be such a good person, but that’s also why I’m so hard on myself. I know what I CAN be, but without the mania I’m never IT."

BipolarMemes,fkiyse2,t1_fkixpde,1584231871.0,"Honestly I have no idea how you do it in the states. I’m in Canada, and lucky enough to have my fathers private insurance as well so my prescriptions total about 32$/month, and even then I find it pretty steep considering the fact that I can only work about twice a week. I really hope that things work out I for you soon, while Wellbutrin and Risperidone  don’t help me 100% (I still get a lot of manic swings and I can be pretty irritable at times) i don’t even want to imagine how I’d cope if I couldn’t afford them anymore."

relationship_advice,fkiknx9,t3_fiowwe,1584222263.0,"I can’t believe he did this to you. Please do not forgive him or ingest anything he gives you again. Replacing your medication, feeding you your pet, feeding you garden slugs, rubbing your toothbrush on the toilet... all of these things are absolutely horrific and disgusting. You could have died. You survived this man’s disgusting treatment now please thrive without him. You are going to begin to feel much better, I hope, after treatment and part of that is because this man will no longer be poisoning you. Nothing you could have possibly done would warrant him treating you like this. Saying he started doing “tests/experiments” on you signals he saw you as a labrat, not a partner. Please keep us updated, and ignore anybody telling you to kill yourself. You are clearly a kind, loving, and compassionate person. He took advantage of you and that is disgusting. I’m sorry."
BipolarMemes,fkiiv57,t1_fkid9ro,1584221047.0,Dang that stings. It’s so hard for me to find the right medication and therapy is too expensive for me at the moment. At least we have each other.

MrsMaisel,fbxqi9n,t1_fbvcj4u,1577197668.0,"In regard to the 'mother's brisket' thing, if it were a family recipe why isn't Maisel saying it's a family recipe? She says it as if her mother made it up, but then why is the mother never seen making it? Also to further the point of the mother supposedly being a bad cook, why when they come back from Paris is she prepared to help and direct Zelda on how to make a French meal for the dean of Columbia but we KNOW from when they were in France that she can't cook at all! So confusing."

MrLove,f7m0430,t1_f7lsutt,1573851546.0,"I’m mostly a passive player, i find it a fun way to kill time and it’s part of my morning routine to do all the daily quests. I even pay for gems sometimes to facilitate my “gaming” experience I. The game (lets just be real, it’s weirdly addictive and I love Gavin & Victor ) I’m also genuinely interested in the story’s main plotline. What I don’t like however are the dates, I just feel like there’s too many of them and I don’t care about Lito or Lucien AT ALL, I also don’t want to spend so much of my time reading about the date that I find hard to fit into the story’s main plot, is she dating all of them and none of them know? Idk, i just don’t like them. I know most people do though, it’s just not why I play the game. I frequent the reddit enough that I can usually read about what happens on the more interesting ones that provide some good character development. But yeah."

TheOA,ezukh5o,t1_ezujfjs,1568154335.0,"I think it’s because the OA was doing a lot more for many people than these other shows which aren’t very original or inspiring. The OA has literally saved people (you can read some of these stories on this subreddit), it’s forged a community, and its story and puzzles have stuck in our heads like almost nothing before or after. It was important for us. These shows, while flashy and fun, aren’t important to us. We are hurt. These shows they are renewing, for a lot of us, simply prove that Netflix only wants to make very hip trendy shows with little to no depth to their story telling and shows that rehash the same cliches we’ve been seeing for the past 20 odd years in television."

You do not know these people’s bodies, their stories, who they are, how quickly they learned them to participate in flashmobs, you know nothing of them. Please do not judge criticize them in this way, it is unjust."
