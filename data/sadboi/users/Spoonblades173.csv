You came here for a reason, as did all of us. We all have problems, some more than others. But please. You may not think so, but you do matter to someone in this twisted world. Take it from us. We know what you’re going through, and we don’t want to fail you. Barrel through the pain. Just because the pain won’t stop coming doesn’t mean that it is all that exists. Please. Don’t do it. I don’t know what we would do if you came here for help and we couldn’t do our part in making sure that you get the help that you need."
