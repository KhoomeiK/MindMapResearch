Wukongmains,fmey5ov,t3_fuumqa,1586016050.0,"2 things to take into consideration against these match-ups:

* wave management
* CD window trading (ex. did darius/nasus just use a Q to take a creep/waveclear? Go in and punish him for that. Just make sure to exit the trade before their CD comes back up or if you're taking too much agro)

for darius, you're looking at these couple of things:

* Using E to reposition yourself into his inner Q ring (I'd avoid using W because it gives him the healing)
* Try to bait out his Q by pretending to mindlessly walk up for a minion
* Farm until 6 and run him down

For nasus, you're looking at these points

* Go in whenever he wants to hit a creep. Avoid using W unless if you positioned yourself between the nasus and his turret for extra damage
* Basic wave management skills: freeze wave near your tower, forcing him to overextend. This calls in a jg to kill him or he'll have to give up that cs to avoid dying. Push the wave when he recalls.
* From the first point, you can also prime-lock Q when he seems like he wants to go for a creep
* Farm up until lv 6 and run him down. It is also possible to do this without your ulti if you played the lvs 1-5 correctly

Recently, my parents have been received this wonderful offer where my family's current Yamaha (1980ish) upright piano can be traded in for a Hailun baby grand piano (for \~5k CAD).

&#x200B;

The seller claims that this is a good offer since he claims that Yamaha pianos are known as ""practice pianos"" and the Hailun one is known as a ""performance piano""

He says that the piano matches the sound of a steinway and sons as there was a test blindfolded, where a pianist claimed that he could not tell the difference between a hailun and a steinway and sons piano.

&#x200B;

Is this Hailun a good offer for my parents to take? When I play something on it, it feels very different (the sound seems a bit like muffed) and the keys feel really weird in a good way (I am able to play a pianissimo without using the una corda pedal).

&#x200B;

what are you thoughts regarding this?
