HighStrangeness,fmv4r5a,t3_fx7pd8,1586406060.0,YOO when I was like 14 or so I used to live in Alabama and I saw something exactly like what’s pictured. I was swimming with my dad in our backyard pool late at night. We heard a low deep rumbling sound that seemed to permeate all around us then within a minute we saw triangle silhouette blocking out the stars moving right over our heads. It seemed to have small dim lights on each triangle edge but I’m not exactly sure as that was 6 years ago. Shortly after it passed over us 3 helicopters followed suit right behind it.
