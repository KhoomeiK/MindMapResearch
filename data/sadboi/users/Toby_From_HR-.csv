China_Flu,fjst8ol,t3_feupgd,1583600285.0,"How would buying masks at Walmart, Lowe's or Walgreens in any way effect healthcare workers from getting masks when their companies and hospitals are ordering from distribution centers or directly from manufacturers.... Last time I checked I don't think they are sending hospital staff to pick up N95s from the local Walmart. 

The people are not responsible for the government and the hospitals failure to plan. If individuals would like to buy masks they are more than in rights to do so. If someone wants to buy a pallet of TP because they are worried and have extra cash to spend, they can."
sanantonio,fjpm4hl,t1_fjplt74,1583554539.0,"It states in the article that the CDC claims that surgical masks are not effective, yet the CDC website itself shows research studies that state otherwise. Also, how in any way at all will a consumer buying a mask from a local store impact the ability of hospitals to acquire masks? Last time I checked they don't buy from Walgreens or Walmart.

As a side note... If masks are inefective why do we need to reserve them for health care workers?"
sanantonio,fjplfmb,t3_feo2ud,1583553987.0,"San Antonio is more concerned about the possibility of not being able to get their Chinese made Fiesta Medals.
