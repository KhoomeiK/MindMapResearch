All I'm saying is in online dating, women have the upper hand and you really need to do something special to cut through and be noticed.

Sometimes, just going to see the doctor in and of itself helps because it is tangible evidence that you are actively trying to correct your mental health issues. I know you say you cant afford it but look into your options. There is also a credit card you can apply for with 18 months no interest monthly payments to pay Bill's with.

I had bad anxiety that day and it made it really hard to concentrate on the girl I was on the 4th date with and acted really awkward around her and I know she picked up on it...I ended up mentioning it the next day so she knew I wasnt losing interest in her. Hope this helps."
