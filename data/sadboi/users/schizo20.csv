schizophrenia,fg39grp,t3_ewnmge,1580475244.0,"Also a message I sent to a doc earlier who I F’d up with because I showed up late. I’m just posting out my life now, but I don’t expect you to read it if you don’t want! I guess I just wanted to post it so I don’t have to explain myself in a different post later! I left everything how I sent it but clipped out my name at the end. And also this is what I mean I feel like I’m changing all the time. Feel free to say getting on meds isn’t hard, I would appreciate the info, and I am ok with sharing why it has been hard for me. I’m not in the business of bashing docs and cutting out conversation (except when I’m anxious/paranoid to talk)

Hey Doc,

I wish you could’ve been my doctor. I also wish I was on meds now. But I showed up late and I understand you probably don’t want patients that are going to keep showing up late. I’ve been on this self love stuff for a couple weeks, but it’s hard to see that the rest of the world loves me too. And this is being spoken from someone who is with themself all the time, I really have no one with me, family, friends, psychiatrist. I am in a circle with myself and saying hurtful things to you doesn’t hype me up or anything and I don’t intend on trying to do that. Anyways, I just wanted to say that I feel like a lab rat to you and the medical profession in general. My diagnoses is schizophrenia, that’s my introduction, hello this is me, my identity now. Like I’m not my own person. Like I can’t think. Like I’m something to be studied, which I turn out to be. And you don’t even want to see me to tell me you don’t want me as a patient and your office wants to charge me with $150 because I inconvened you. But this is my life and I have to be here all the time. So I’m inconvened. And trust me, I’m not into getting stuff I don’t deserve, but I wish I got $150 for how much other people being consumed in themselves has F’ed me up. And I’m not just talking about my schedule. But also that’s just my fault (I’m trying to say sorry here for showing up late). You get to go home and be happy. So I guess I’m saying I’m wishing you and others would care and shoot, maybe at the core I’m envious. Navigating this health system has been absolute hell and I can’t get on meds. For my fault and maybe for other people just caring about money or their morning coffee or something. And no I’m not making these attacks directly towards you, but just how my little (really nonexistent) interaction with you perfectly describes how it is being here. I wish I got to know you. Because I’m so numb right now (and always) and I don’t know if I’m making false assumptions about you. I’m not here in this world with you and I wish you knew how that felt and the many ways this sentence means to me. I wonder if I showed up just a couple minutes earlier if you would have the energy to unf*** up my life and remove all the s*** I hear in the head and my grossly unstable mood. And my unsureness in my connection to God and my conception of you and psychiatrists in general. But I know you care about your people (family, connections with coworkers, friends, life) and you have boundaries. You’ve got a life to live and that’s so healthy. But if I think hard I realize I’m similar, I watch out for myself. I do know that some parts of me look out for me and they speak my mind when it’s time. I hope you have a good day, doc, I do hope you do. If you really read all of this, I appreciate it, I really do, especially considering I’m not your active patient. I typed this with NO ill will.

Sincerely,
M"
schizophrenia,fg38lcu,t3_ewnmge,1580474425.0,"Also to explain the pic a bit: on the left hand it says “God save me, from them, from me”. I’ve been feeling the presence of God recently, despite being atheist for a good amount of my life. I’m holding on to a force that can save me from people in their own circles and myself from letting other peoples circles affect mine. Also talking about voices I have and being paranoid about different things like people in my car, cops, etc. Also talks about how I’m so different at times and how I might not be here one day because a circle I’m in. Also (in relation to “them”) gives me comfort from the judgement that I’ll get if I’m not here one day or do some stupid shit (like I did before going into the hospital, I’m sorry!!), because I trust in that “me” to have made the choice. Also now talking about the judgement I’ll get for being out of line here in this post 😢😢 (but I did get on meds and went to the hospital, I just feel like maybe these aren’t the ones!). The “(:” faces represent the judgement I feel from others because I remember my friend telling me years and years ago (despite my terrible memory!) that if you use a “:)” instead of a “(:” then it’s weird. But I think I take it to heart because that’s what I see in people. They are in their own circles and see me so different, I am no one to them, and I mean nothing to them, and one small thing can mean something so different, and you can F up w someone so quick. Also with voices, you say one say thing and you’re F’d. So I drew a “🙂” and said “this is me” with arrows pointing to the “🙂”s.

On the right hand it says “invite them with prose (PROSE again on the right bc handwriting, I wanted that one especially to be clear), confidence, and normalcy”. It’s because I feel like I feel like so much depends on communications and crafting up a good way to say something. And maybe that has F’ed up my relationships w people and maybe including the useless (and sometimes debilitating) meds that docs gave me from my  bad explanations. I am a different person at times and one person will give a good explanation and the other is in a different world. For confidence: I feel like I gotta just be confidence and make my self act in some way to come off to other people right. It can change everything, at least in my case. I’ll start believing stuff, other people start believing that I’m not okay, and then there’s a vibe that lingers. For normalcy: just what has become normal. In this world, what people believe, and what I believe"

schizophrenia,fb6dtp6,t1_fb69plj,1576547821.0,"No see a therapist, seeing things isn't normal and that's something to talk about. And if you end up having more psychosis later in life (or maybe now since you said they just started back up) then I think it's important to start early. When you talk to your therapist they can let you know whens a good time to start going to the psychiatrist to see if there's a diagnoses that describes what you're going through and/or get you on some meds to help. I just mean that the treatment is really up to you. I just typed all that out because in my eyes it's easy for a misunderstanding to happen and for them to get you on antipsychotics. But I mean it's not the end of the world, maybe antipsychotics would help you. Or maybe you really need to be on antipsychotics, a lot of people do and especially in this sub. I guess my point is that you shouldn't blow off any skepticism. Listen to other people, especially docs, but just don't forget to listen to yourself. I wouldn't want you to deal with this by yourself because then you're only relying on yourself for input. And with delusions that can be dangerous, but even just in general it's good to get input like you did with this post"
schizophrenia,fb4rs4k,t1_fb3kw1u,1576514390.0,"Not an issue, lots of people with psychosis come here. All are welcomed. Seeing things that aren't there isn't normal, so it's good to get some perspective on that. Don't get stressed about posting here, if someone is here only for the folks that are currently diagnosed with schizophrenia then they can just not comment on your post, simple.

You said you started seeing things in November, so really anything could happen. You could really have psychosis that will last for X years (maybe even your whole life) or maybe you're caught in lots of vicious cycles that is driving you crazy. You could just be thinking that you're seeing things that may be feeding into a vicious cycle of stress and confusion for you (but I mean you could also be in vicous cycle if you're psychotic too, so vicious cycles are something to watch out for either way). That's why I suggest trying to look into ways to calm yourself and reduce symptoms early because if you're not actually seeing things then feeding into the cycle of thinking that you are will make you go crazy. Kinda like if you were in an argument and you keep denying the other person when you know you're wrong, then eventually it becomes natural and the argument goes on forever. Now I'm not saying that you know you're not seeing things and you're faking it, I'm saying that IF you're able to reduce symptoms/experiences you're having with regular ways of calming yourself and accepting this world then you DO NOT want to get sucked into taking antipsychotics, regular doctor appointments, etc. All it takes is one convincing clinical evaluation and a diagnoses and you're in the MH system for the long haul. If you were actually misdiagnosed then you will be facing an uphill battle with future psychiatrists and care providers to convince them that there must've been a misunderstanding on the diagnoses that a past doctor gave you. Either that or you're explaining to the same doc that there must've been a misunderstanding, all while they don't trust you because they think you're delusional. If there is any way you can reduce stress, hallucinations, and anxiety with things like fish oil, meditation, stress management, sleep, journaling, etc. then do that early!!! On the other hand, if you end up figuring out that there is a diagnoses that fits you really well (like schizophrenia for example), then finding these strategies early is still really important. I forgot where I heard this, but if you start getting treatment early onset, then your chances of still being able to function later on are improved. Or maybe that was just about getting on antipsychotics early, I don't remember.

Edit/TLDR: I'll also include that it's generally accepted that all of this psychosis stuff is not an exact science just yet. That's why I encourage caution and skepticism when swimming through the mental health system. Even if your diagnoses is correct and you should be on meds, it's good to understand why you're taking something. Caution when you think you're faking it. Caution when you're getting on new meds. Caution when you think you're right over your doctor's advice. Caution when taking your doctor's advice. Caution when taking advice from my opinions. Because once you believe in something it can change everything: the decisions you make, how you act, and the expectations that you feel from people and yourself. Just be careful and as real as you can be with yourself"
schizophrenia,fb3gvin,t3_eb992r,1576472748.0,"I think you've gotten a lot of feedback on the faking part, I definitely think it's a common thing among folks with psychosis. With that being given, I wanna play devils advocate to bring up my thoughts on the other side of this because I think about this a lot for myself. Maybe you could be really anxious/depressed/bipolar or caught in a lot of viscous cycles. Have you talked with a doc recently? How would you describe your hallucinations? Because for myself when I had my first psychotic episode I felt like my brain was overloading trying to make myself see something that wasn't there. But I also wasn't sure if that was a delusion or not because it also tied in with some other thoughts I was having. If you think it's more of an envisioning thing or quick flashes that you don't get a good view of, then I'd say keep doing what your doing with a little bit of skepticism. Could be schizophrenia, could not be. Now if you're seeing a little girl standing in the middle of the road or see/feel insects running up your arms then I'd say there's a better chance that your diagnoses is correct.

I just bring this up because meds can be harsh on your body and treatment is expensive. If you go years down thinking that you're seeing things and going into viscous cycles of thought I think that can really fuck you up. I feel like that's why I'm okay with self destructing now and I really admire everyone that's able to keep up with life consistently. Again, I say this because I think about it for myself. People can only understand what you're going through to the extent that they listen/care/understand, so at the end of the day you're the one that will have to figure out what's going on because you know you the best. I think for me light journaling has helped me out the most. I just write down things that I'm feeling, things that are starting to become problems, and thoughts I have. If you figure out that it's possible for you to suppress some things you're experiencing without meds (like calming yourself, therapy, social interaction, non-stressful environments) then I'd try to follow that routine because it's much more rewarding than the life on meds if you don't need to be on them. Plus, even if you need to be on meds those finding techniques to calm yourself down are helpful anyways.

With all of that said though, just keep trying to figure out what's going on and getting treatment if you have the slightest suspicion that you need it. Feeling like you're faking it can be a delusion, believe me I get it like a mf'er. But if you're one of the lucky ducklings that can run free from the land of APs then I'd take your ticket and run with it fast. And I hope none of this comes off as invalidating anything you're experiencing, that's not my intention. You know what you're experiencing the best, but I just want to give the other side as something to consider"

Honestly alcohol hit a lil bit differently there. Despite all the warnings with weed for folks w psychosis, I’ve been a heavy weed smoker for a while because I like it. I do notice that I occasionally get anxiety, paranoia, and hallucinations (mostly auditory, but not voices) when I smoke, but I’ll do it anyways because I don’t mind too much.

I’ve been big anti-medication and anti-medical system for the last few months because my paranoia targets that + bad experiences with psychiatrists specifically, so that’s why I ended up not wanting to continue meds. In the last few days I’ve been opening up to the idea of going back, so I’m planning to call on Monday to get an appointment scheduled again. I’ve been a unstable psychotic/manic/depressive mess and I need to start getting back on treatment.

My weight loss has been due to depression and some hallucinations. Most of the time food smells like it’s rotten, laced with something, or like someone cummed on it. But it’s not bad all the time, sometimes I just don’t think about eating. Though I hope APs will keep me at a lower weight. Risperdal shot my weight up like a mf’er, so hopefully I’ll get an AP that does the opposite of that if they switch me off Abilify.

And I appreciate the heads up on alcohol. I’m not looking to start another addiction, but it was nice to loosen up and just chill for a second.

But regardless of what I get persuaded into believing, I’d rather be here with me than be naive.

edit: And I think my other answer would be to feel like myself again. If I had convincing evidence that this world wasn’t taken over and things couldn’t see all my thoughts then I wouldn’t have as much fear.

I was failing school because risperdal gave me lots of debilitating side effects and my pdoc just didn’t care. That man had made his mind up and I was going to take risperdal. My parents told me this.

Another pdoc ghosted me because their receptionist gave me her personal phone number. I called her once telling her that I was running late. She told me that my appointment was and hour before the time that I received and 5m later I received a call from the receptionist telling me to not  to call that number. I agreed, but before hanging up with the pdoc I scheduled an appointment. When I went to this appointment I couldn’t find her so I left. No one there at the building they told me to go to. Never contacted them again.

My sister also has issues with this, she is diagnosed bipolar. She can’t even get them to take her seriously to get an appointment. They keep rescheduling her and she can’t get an appointment.

My therapist doesn’t say much so sometimes I think it’s because she’s just telling me ramble and okay with it. Sometimes she’s quick to schedule the next appointment and I feel like it’s because I’m just income for her and their group. It feels like a business to me. To extend off of that I’ve been told that some doctors get commission for getting you on a specific antipsychotic so I don’t trust them, especially when they act like they know everything and tell me everything I need to do without explaining anything. Like they don’t even interact with what I say and you got me fucked up if I’m going to put their antipsychotics in my system without a real explanation. I know that they’re smart and they went to school for this, but I have to go through hell everyday, they don’t (hell being whatever symptoms of schizoaffective). I wish they realized that that hour means a lot to me because I’m going to be alone for the next month or however long. But I don’t blame them entirely, I know they’re seeing a lot of people so giving 100% individual attention to every person they see may not be healthy for them. It’s okay. But that’s why I trust myself before anything they say to me because I know that I care more about me than they do. But that last part is just life. It’s just that I have trust issues paying them for the hour to care about my life when I know they can’t.

I think these things simple things have manifested because I get paranoid about medical people too. Sticking needles in my back, restraining me, etc. I feel like I’m about to me stuck by a needle and took back into the psych ward.

I thought it was more descriptive of the thoughts I had been having recently. The girl I see in the back of my car or the various foods that are yelled at me or the bugs that bite me don’t have any meaningful connection to me that I feel the need to talk about.

I usually only post on here because I don’t talk to anyone about my condition. My family does know that I’ve been diagnosed with schizophrenia and they’ve seen me psychotic sometimes. And honestly I get worried that yes, maybe I am a faker. Some of my first posts on here are about how I’m a poser. I second guess hearing voices that are telling me that I’m not hearing voices. I wonder if maybe I’m too dependent and use schizophrenia as a cover up because I didn’t learn how to not self destruct when I was young. My voices could be me just putting myself in a panic state or something

And all of that comes into a vicious cycle. I’m sure that I’m a poser so I don’t seek help or medication and then I deal with the consequences. And again, I’m not saying I’m schizophrenic. Maybe I don’t need to be on risperdal, maybe I should be on different meds or maybe I just need good therapy.

On yalls point about identity, I feel like I’ve made it apart of my identity because it’s always been me vs the world and I think that’s how is. I feel like I’m expected to be apart of society, think “their” way, take meds to dull my mind down. No one understands the things I see, hear, feel, etc even it’s it’s not schizophrenia. I feel like folks on r/schizophrenia are closer to me than everyone else (maybe similar to the neurodivergent and neurotypical stuff), but I still understand that it’s just me. Everyone is far away dealing with their own things, so I know it’s only me, but that’s not a bad thing. I understand. I think your post is an example of that (not to say your point is bad, maybe I’m completely misled in the way I feel about life). Y’all say that I just need to get on medication, but to me that doesn’t feel right for all the reasons that I listed. My “delusions” have always been antithetical to the notion of help, so I never seek it. I’ve always been paranoid about taking a leap of faith into the medical system and medication. I don’t trust beings that are alive because I feel like everyone is controlled by demons and they’re all working with each other. Like when you made this post it’s because your inner demon was trying to get me and others on meds and hold you tighter into meds. The only one who can verify that is myself because I’m here with me and that’s why I need to wait to make the decision for myself to get proper and active treatment. I’m not going to go to my medicine cabinet and start taking risperdal again until I believe it myself. So I’m waiting for that time to come and if it’s meant to happen I believe that it will. I just bring these things up because that’s why I don’t trust anyone. And again maybe that goes back to needing therapy or I didn’t teach myself that I need to be normal, take my meds, and function. Maybe I use the “antithetical to the notion of help” thing to keep myself in the same loop when I’m not actually schizophrenic. I’m making steps like going to the psychiatrist and therapist and outpatient groups, so if it’s true I believe I will figure it out at some point. 

On yalls point about not being medicated, I’m not medicated currently and haven’t been for ~4 months? A big part is the poser thing and also that I don’t trust the docs. Every time I’ve been inpatient I don’t trust because I feel like things are set up somehow. Plus, if I could trust them idk how I could’ve gotten this diagnoses 4 times by different people. I feel like they’re trying to sell me meds. Like they earn a commission, among other things.

I appreciate you posting this, even if I’m not schizophrenic. I think you have a very valid point. I didn’t reply with the intention of saying “I feel like I’m not schizophrenic, but look, I actually am!!” It’s been something that’s been on my mind and I see y’alls points. I’m seeing a different psychiatrist soon so maybe I’ll get a different diagnoses. I like open dialogue and I don’t feel like you should face the shit storm because the last thing I want is for this community to be ruled by downvoted and shutting down posts that may be true."

I drew the flower because it felt like an actual moment of silence and peace that I've been hoping for. Like I heard a ""shhhhhhh"" and a flower silently sprouted from the wish of silence. Silence definitely represents a good thing for me and I think it's something that my voices like too. Their intentions are bad with it though (it means peace for them which means taking control of me), so that's why I'm not sure if silence ultimately means a good thing. The flower is kinda bittersweet because I know the voices enjoy it, but I'm sure in my liking for silence

I'm hoping to get better at drawing things because I think that I could really express what voices mean to me that way. But I'm glad that you liked it and many others were able to relate.

I always need to make reasons to cover up my sz because if they knew that I had sz then I'd have to deal with the awkwardness. So I guess I'm glad that I don't need to deal with them actually knowing that I have sz, but I do have to lie all the time and just pretend that I'm multitasking in my brain when in reality my brain is like a little octopus dancing in circles that makes me / gives me the opportunity live in multiple realities. I'm not sure if dealing with the awkwardness would be better than having to lie all the time because if someone knows I have sz then I can't tell if they're genuinely pure anymore and that's dangerous for me. It's like if they know I have sz then they know enough about me to obfuscate their real intentions and then I'm not safe from them.

But that’s just me. My reaction is based on the relationship that I have with my ex, so maybe your ex wouldn’t react similarly. I still think it’s a good idea that you didn’t honk at them though."

schizophrenia,eyznd4j,t3_cyvha2,1567621556.0,I usually can’t show emotion so I just try to fake it. Even the people who think they understand me still find it weird if I’m not showing emotion. It’s exhausting. I feel like I’m a sociopath for it

Thank you for this"
schizophrenia,eytemgn,t3_cyoqqd,1567434482.0,"There’s a schizophrenia quiz that’s been going around that, so maybe you should take that and see if the questions are close to your experiences. If the results only further your suspicions then I’d visit a doctor. When I was developing schizophrenia I only experienced 1 and 5 from your list"
schizophrenia,eypix54,t1_eypbju6,1567301420.0,Same here. Biggest thing that happened was someone trying to get out by slamming the door with a chair.
schizophrenia,eypinlx,t3_cy159l,1567301196.0,"I smelt my ex on my fingers sometime last week. Like how things smelt in the early/good parts of our relationship. Then I smelt SEX on my fingers.

Washed my hands a hundred times god dammit."
schizophrenia,eyoupvb,t3_cxa2k9,1567283650.0,"I’m going to spill some tea for you because I sound exactly like the guy you’re describing. This will be a bit verbose so apply the things that you think are applicable to your situation. Also this is not a description of everyone with schizophrenia, just me.

Before I started dating my ex I told her I had schizophrenia right away so she would know. I felt like that was something that she should be able to decide whether or not she could live with for the rest of her life (if the relationship got that far, which it didn’t). I cared about her too much to let that truth dawn on her because she’d certainly figure out my diagnoses later on. To some degree, I didn’t want to be with her because I was afraid that I’d be a burden on her. I wasn’t seeing a doctor and wasn’t taking medication. Before I was doing both and the medication was TERRIBLY debilitating. I dropped out of school because of it.

During the relationship and after it I’ve gotten much better. I’m in college now, I’m very likely to get a good job in my field when I graduate, and I’m currently working an internship fine. I’m not taking any meds right now and I still experience symptoms. I feel like the symptoms are manageable for a small subset of people with schizophrenia. Whether or not that is sustainable in the long run is up to the gods, but I have hope. If you’re still considering seeing this guy or even just being his friend all I can say is be there for him and don’t be manipulative. I felt so alone and having someone there to tell me what was real and what wasn’t helped. If you have some manipulative aspects it can really fuck with what is real to a person with schizophrenia as it did with me + you may become part of their paranoia/delusions. If he has a suspicious that may be true, please don’t point it back to his diagnoses. At the same time, give him independence. For his and for your wellbeing.

If you have any questions feel free to PM me, reply to my comment, or sift through my post history. I’m tired because I’ve been at the hospital for a while so a vast majority of this comment may be shit. The TLDR will probably be a bit more clear.

TLDR: 1) It’s possible for him to manage without meds. Whether that’s sustainable in the long run is up to the gods. Research suggests not. 2) maybe he doesn’t want your support because he doesn’t want to be a burden on you. I’d suggest still being there for him, I think he’d really appreciate it. 3) If you do break the barrier of being able to support him, let him be independent to save headaches on both ends."

schizophrenia,eyomxmt,t3_cxsi57,1567279784.0,I felt like someone was there going to sleep with me rubbing my eyebrow. I felt like I was being touched or brushed with something. I saw black dots everywhere. I heard voices yelling at me. The world was so loud. Racing thoughts.
ExNoContact,eym0the,t3_cxl5ah,1567196675.0,"I feel like it depends on your situation so idk. In most cases I feel like (a) can be manipulative and disrespectful for no reason. I don’t really like when people feed off me, especially when I went in having genuinely good intentions. Additionally, I feel like getting empowerment from crossing your ex is just another form of dependency. I think (a) can be well deserved in some situations, but I would personally err on the side of (b).

Just my opinion :)! You know the situation with your ex the best and ultimately it’s your decision."
ExNoContact,eyk66ti,t3_cwoxo1,1567138192.0,"Hey I saw your post earlier today and was thinking about you before I went to sleep so I hopped back on reddit to find your post and comment. This person is such a shitty person. So shitty that someone else that doesn’t even know them was bothered enough to be thinking about them before they went to sleep. Fuck them, you deserve so much more. This woman doesn’t even have basic decency, RIP to whoever’s life she’s fucking up now. Keep your head as high as you can :). If I was in your position I’d be in shambles because that is some downright manipulative power move type of stuff."
ExNoContact,eyk5j9a,t3_cx8o2y,1567137586.0,I’m adopting this mentality; it’s so applicable in my situation. Thank you for sharing!
ExNoContact,exsgztp,t3_cu7e0w,1566544184.0,"It seems like most people are saying that it’s a bad idea because it’s a indirect form of contact, but I personally think you should get that sweater back. I like the idea of contacting his mom and making it clear that you just want the swear back, you’re not trying to start any conversations. I like that you have the mindset of trying to sever ties. My ex has a shirt that was gifted to me from my parents. I was going to ask for it back, but I decided not to and just forget about it. For me that was sufficient to “sever ties”, but I think if I was in your situation I’d want to get the sweater back. Sure, you can move on without it / breaking NC, but personally I see a possibility of you getting your sweater back being beneficial (as long as you wash it a 100 times if/when you get it back!). Just another opinion :). Like I said, I believe you could  100% sever ties without getting the sweater back. This is just my thought process if I was in your situation."
