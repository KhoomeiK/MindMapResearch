rant,fpmc4oc,t3_ge5mmn,1588729875.0,"Without criticizing you, I want to explain my position.  My purpose for writing this is to help you understand why what your describing happens. 

Good is a feeling, it isn’t something everyone can agree on.  That is a fact.  So, when you say “this music is good” you can be talking about anything.  When Hip-Hop started sometime in the 80s it was meant to invigorate the free wheeling African Americans.  Similar to funk.  It was supposed to make you move and dance.  That was the goal.  The music and hip hop today still does that.  You are right about the lyricism.  Although saying all hip hop today is trash, is too broad a statement.  It’s the same kind of statement that gets racists in trouble(Ex. All black people are loud.). Anyways, the lyricism of mainstream hip hop pop is lacking something.  It’s lacking the humor, effort, care, vocabulary, etc that 90s hip hop seemed to have.  This is because hip hop started in the 80s.  All genres have a peak. This is just the natural rhythm of everything.  Everything degrades.  In order for you to have the great hip hop, you have to have the terrible hip hop.  

That’s all I got."

I have the same problem.  I can say that if you do stutter, pretend that you didn’t.  Some people stutter and say something like “bleh, I’m sorry, I stutter when I talk.”  Don’t do that, it calls attention to it.  People are not paying attention to the way you speak, but they pay attention to the information.   So, if you insist on saying something after you stutter say “What am I trying to say, hold on.”  Then after you think about what you wanna say, say it slower.  This usually works for me and it should work for you.  Good luck!"
