Anxiety,fqe4lyw,t3_fj2y1a,1589301664.0,"Good Michigan news today! 

Indicators that show Michigan‚Äôs positive progress in the coronavirus crisis:

**1. Average number of new cases a day has plummeted.**

**2. Deaths are down 45% from a month ago.** 

**3. Hospitalizations are down 64% from a month ago.**

**4. Testing has almost tripled.**

**5. Testing is finding fewer new cases.**

**6. A projection model used by the White House projects a sharp drop in Michigan‚Äôs coronavirus deaths in June and July.**

Some of my favorite quotes: 

>""Even with more testing, the number of cases has declined. In the first seven days of May, Michigan had 3,754 confirmed new COVID-19 cases, compared to 7,818 during the first seven days of April, a 52% drop.""  
>  
>  
>  
>‚ÄúWe have not seen a significant jump in the death rate, and hospitalizations have not mirrored the increase in the number of cases we‚Äôre seeing.‚Äù

Basically even with TRIPLE the testing, our new cases are still less than what they were last month, and the case increase isn't leading to a comparable hospitalization increase, meaning a higher percentage of new cases now are mild! Yay Michigan!
