SuicideWatch,f84q4g2,t3_dyznxz,1574257763.0,"I feel this so much.. also i think the reason people only help or can help suicidal people up to a certain point is because most people don‚Äôt understand what it‚Äôs like to feel that way.
From my experience having been hospitalized and having been in a few therapy groups i can safely say that suicidal people are the only ones that can truly help other suicidal people. We know what it‚Äôs like and probably care enough to try and make an effort to take the pain of others away even though we (atleast i) are usually convinced that we ourselves are a lost cause. 

I wish i could help you, friend. All i can do is tell you that, if you want to, that i‚Äôm here for you if you need/want to talk."
