Giving my bullying boss time to play the isolation/silent treatment game (for about 7 months now). I've tried to turn it into a time for peace and calm. I walk the office stairs, meditate and find practice exercises for the technology she challenged me to learn. About once a month or so she tells me we're going to discuss my new assignment. The dates she promises come and go without a word. I made the mistake of asking her in an email, when are we going to meet (I've been waiting patiently). She responded in an email that "" I have not been waiting patiently!"" So ... I won't send her anymore emails unless she sends me one that requires a response. No more taking her bait. I'm here when she develops the emotional maturity to have a conversation with me. Not sure there's anything I can do at this point, but wait for the MCCR fact finding conference."

Anxiety,f9tlsb7,t3_e6t3w4,1575631131.0,"It might not be in your head. You might have a bad boss in a toxic environment that he or she fosters. I'm in the middle of a Civil Rights battle with my boss through the Maryland Commission on Civil Rights. I spend most of my work day doing anti anxiety exercises. Because nobody talks to me or responses to my emails and I don't know why. I didn't have run ins with everybody. Some of those folks just stopped talking to me. So, I've been in intense, "" tackle my anxiety"" mode. Meditations, frequently walking a few flights of stairs, my favorite music with stereo headphones, the Headspace app, YouTube anti affirmation videos and binaural beats, CBD, chamomile and valerian root teas, ashwagandha and almost anything I can find on the internet that doesn't seem dangerous.  And I feel like I'm really getting better. I started the intense focus about 3 months as go. With effort, you can gain some ground on your anxiety.  Beast wishes. Good luck."

Anxiety,f44xkah,t3_djfs5j,1571361109.0,That Headspace app has been great in terms of keeping me on a schedule/regiment. It's  like a consciousness you always kind of knew.
