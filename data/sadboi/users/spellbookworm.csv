depression,f8egg42,t3_e0e60k,1574527124.0,"Depression isn’t glamorous or relatable or something you change out of with the next season’s trend.

It’s staring at the wall for hours at night thinking about the time you fucked up something 6 years ago, unable to let it go. 

It’s wondering if you should have some sort of emergency plan in case you have another breakthrough “bad day” on the meds and relapse into cutting. 

It’s being unsure if feeling numb is better than feeling like you want to die all the time.

It’s worrying that you will never feel normal, dreading the fact that this *is* our normality and the battle is lifelong, and knowing that people still stigmatize us because their vision of depression is a single tear rolling down a young beautiful girls face."

pettyrevenge,f7i9x1w,t1_f7i5fwn,1573755659.0,"One of my proudest moments: 

There was a lady standing in the bathroom taking a call, and I really had to shit. And she was just standing there by the sinks. Just talking on the phone. Maybe she likes the smell of people's poop, idk.

Anyway, I am the reigning champ of the public bathroom Mexican standoff. I will literally hold back searing hot diarrhea if need be, until I am completely alone, because caca time is a sacred and private moment meant only to be shared by me, myself and I. On many an occasion I have spent upwards of 10 minutes doing my best Hoover Dam impression, forcing the other woman(en) to sigh in exasperation and leave, defeated by my butthole of steel. But *this fucken woman*. I mean, who just has a fucking phone convo in the bathroom, *for fun*? There are empty hallways *right there*!?!? She tested my patience and poopchute's reserve far beyond the limit.

I am a super reserved person. Like, I can't even be mean to the bitchiest person in the world's face, because confrontation is not my style. But after a morning workout, fiber gummies, and a hot cup of coffee, my colon does not fuck around. It's a matter of life or death. And this goddamn woman. Would not. Leave.

So I put my palms to my lips, wrist to wrist to form a v-shape (or, for this purpose, a butt shape) made a seal and BLEW as hard as a fucking could, resulting in the **loudest, wettest sounding fart in the universe.** She went dead quiet for a moment, and I knew damn well the person on the other line of the call could hear it as well, because they went quiet too. And then I said in my most stern, no-bullshit voice I could muster, ""A little privacy, please??"" She left pretty quickly then.

And thus, my reign as the Supreme Office Shitter continues unchallenged."

One of my bullies in high school tried reconnecting with me. Why? idk, maybe looking for a quick booty call or something.

I think he was just extremely insecure, but definitely weaponized it.

Now he's all SJW and ""cares"" about women's rights and, worst of all, works as a teacher of students who are at an impressionable age.
