BPD,fn4j7uh,t3_fzf1fn,1586642488.0,Yes please!! Trying to learn the skills on my own gets overwhelming pretty quickly for me so having a community to learn with would really help.

westworld,flvwxm5,t1_flvwfeg,1585534061.0,"YES!! I have been looking for this, the scene with Thomas is what really sold it for me. “When will we stop pretending” line reminded me of the first time Delores and William slept together as well."

TheOA,fhhbly1,t3_f39px2,1581600100.0,"This made me think about the saying “eyes are the window to the soul” both are pretty significant in The OA. Prairie’s blindness, the eye keychain, the soul/invisible self."
