depression,fng3jpr,t1_fng3d1p,1586921481.0,The best they would do for my depression was therapy but stopped paying for it once they saw slight improvements in me thinking I was at 100% and have tried many times
depression,fng33wh,t1_fng3189,1586921190.0,I have. Then they always find some type of excuse or just say that I have to do it because they own the house and I’m still not old enough to leave yet

Animedubs,fnbxm5c,t3_fyeop7,1586824351.0,"Since quarantine started I have gotten into anime for the first time so I have watched 17 animes and planning to watch more soon! Some of my favorites have been 7 deadly sins, sword art online, darling in the franxx, no game no life, rising of the shield hero, one punch man, andhighschool dxd. Definitely some thrilling anime’s that my heart got connected to! 11/10 in my book"
AskReddit,fl8ywg5,t3_fncbz6,1584935939.0,"Nope I would not, I have to many extra lumps of fat"
DarlingInTheFranxx,fl8yszs,t1_fl8xaiu,1584935866.0,I feel like a remake would keep the life in the characters since we already have a good backstory with them so they don’t have to be reincarnated. But I hope season 2 comes regardless and hope they do it well!
DarlingInTheFranxx,fl8yhbg,t1_fl8yerx,1584935616.0,Why do you have the need to comment? There was no need to do so and I didn’t plan on spamming it.

DarlingInTheFranxx,fl8ppo2,t1_fl8c1wx,1584929281.0,That’s probably true but I wanted to still try because you never know
DarlingInTheFranxx,fl7l7b7,t1_fl74apf,1584904038.0,My thoughts exactly! I felt like my heart was ripped out during the show because of how invested I was in the emotions they all had for each other and the situation! I didn’t like the whole reincarnation idea because they wouldn’t be the same
DarlingInTheFranxx,fl73w9u,t1_fl73um2,1584893649.0,Your probably right but it never hurts to try.
