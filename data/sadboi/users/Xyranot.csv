I hid this however as my area is extremely prejudiced in general. I would dress in female clothes at every oppurtunity I could and often dreamt of waking up as a girl one day. I knew that some people changed from men to women and vice versa, but I thought this was more of a choice thing rather than a medical need, so I initially dismissed it. It was actually my boyfriend who introduced me to what being trans really meant at the end of 2018, and since then I've identified with it a lot, although I didn't come out first until last year, and have yet to come out to most of my family."

mentalillness,fna0tdp,t1_fn9ttxg,1586788805.0,"Okay so this is just my personal experience and it doesnt necessarily mean it will work for anyone else.

As soon as I left that hospital, after the worst week of my life, as soon as I stepped out the front door, the cold air hit my face, and I was just so appreciative of everything. Not regretful, not anything, just appreciative, and still. For the first time in so long all the shit in my head just stopped. That moment gave me a small glimmer of what life could be, and so I decided to work to get that feeling again. I exercised daily, experimented with many different experiences and hobbies I had never tried before, got in to music, got in to Buddhist philosophy, (I attribute a large amount of my recovery to Buddhism, particularly meditation) and I found my boyfriend, which tbh is probably the biggest reason I got better. I just felt like he completely filled that hole in my soul which had been screaming at me all my life.

Again, this is just me, this may not work for you, but you have to try at least, because something will work, and you'll look back on these moments as relics of the past, while you're living your best life. Please, please, keep trying.

I don't know if I'm allowed to link here but you should go to YouTube and search ""For fuck sake don't kill yourself"", this changed my mind sent towards the issue a lot.

And if you ever, ever, ever need anything, message me and I will respond asap. Don't ever feel like you're bothering me or anyone else by asking for help. You deserve happiness, you deserve love, you are beautiful, I love you."
