None of which could have been recorded in a studio unfortunately. The best we can hope for is boombox recordings, and some of which planned songs are probably on the MoH soundtrack. Do re mi was played by Eric, Kurt and Pat. If it was recorded/still exists, only time will tell."

Cannabis will become huge in Europe in the next 20 years. Not because of people changing their minds or becoming more informed, simply because of the huge amount of money that can be made from it. North America has shown that, we just need to wait for the rest of the world to latch on."

What I found useful is using cognitive behavioural therapy techniques to breakdown my thoughts and looking at them analytically. Once you decrease you anxious thoughts they'll decrease when you smoke too. Good luck!

It has, however, made me realise more how truly gifted and talented Kurt and others were to be producing the music they were being so young. I no longer see Kurts demise as this romanticised legend as I have throughout my youth, just a talented but very troubled young guy."

NUFC,esvvked,t3_btedvd,1562304827.0,"I'm still confident the takeover is on. I assume we're under transfer embargo so no assets can move in or out of the club. Obviously the Perez was a buy out clause which can't be avoided, but the likes of Joselu who is allegedly moving to Deportivo, still hasn't moved and seems to be 'held up'. He also didn't attend training. 

The club knew Rafa would be leaving, and as incompetent as we are at getting things done quickly, again it seems we are unable to hire anyone due to this embargo. For example, Pardew was hired just a couple of days after Hughton was sacked. Same with McClaren and Benitez. 

This is just my opinion, but personally I am still quitetly confident."
