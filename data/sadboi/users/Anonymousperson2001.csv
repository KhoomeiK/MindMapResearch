So when I was growing up, I was the perfect daughter until 3rd grade. After 3rd grade, I started getting bullied at school, my parents started comparing me to other children, I started lagging in studies, I hated myself, I wanted to die, I felt like no one understood me or liked me, my mother started hitting me more, my younger sister started hitting me to get attention and then she used to lie and say that it was self defence, I stopped being the confident child I was. 


Then there was that time when my mother found out my search history and she realised I might be into girls, lmao the beating I got. Everything continued to get bad especially because I wanted to die, so everything just natural got worse. I used to dream day and night about getting away from all this. 

It happened to me last year, I went to another country for uni but I had to come back because of the virus and the flashbacks have been so bad. Everything got bad. My mother has been okay until today, I know the pattern. She is gonna start being who she is and I am gonna hate myself even more."

I know I don‚Äôt want to die but death just sounds so peaceful and permanent, I used to fantasize about suicide so much, two years ago I would have attempted but now? I am just used to thinking that suicide will bring me peace, I know I don‚Äôt want to die but I don‚Äôt want to stay alive either. I just want all of this to stop. The thing is, I know if I don‚Äôt get help I am gonna end up attempting suicide maybe not now but in a few years I‚Äôll be done with trying everyday. Even therapy and medicines work to an extent, mental illness don‚Äôt really have a proper treatment (that‚Äôs my opinion, I could be wrong but that‚Äôs what I think). 


I know myself, I keep changing my addictions to stay alive. As far as I can remember I actually had healthy addictions (I mean no addiction is healthy but it used to be healthier), I used to play basketball everyday for 6 hours once that stopped helping me stay sane (or maybe the bullying got worse or my mother got worse or maybe both) I started cutting (that‚Äôs the only addiction I haven‚Äôt been able to stop, I easily change my addictions but cutting? I can‚Äôt stop cutting) then I started binge eating to feel better, then my mother started calling me fat and I started restricting and that was so addictive (I used to go weeks without having a proper meal, my migraines started around that time), then I actually started thinking about suicide every second of my day, then I started drinking so I could feel happy for a while, then I went numb (I have been disassociating so much I don‚Äôt know what or where I am), then I started vaping (it helped relieve stress and headaches), then I started studying 24*7 and then I started smoking cigarettes (I reduced my intake from 6 cigs to 1 cig a day) and then I started weed (I went back to my country and weed isn‚Äôt legal here so). 



Now I just binge tv shows to numb or distract myself from the reality. I know I should stop escaping from reality but I can‚Äôt, it just hurts too much. If I was still on campus, I would be studying all day and then being high until I passed out/slept. I kind of liked that part where I used to study all day but it started affecting me a lot, I love socializing but my anxiety has been eating me up a lot recently."

I forgot how bad I get when I come back to my family , I forgot how bad it gets. I am binge watching shows so that I can disconnect from myself (I dissociate so much I forgot what feelings were). I started watching Skins, I knew that show was gonna trigger a lot of stuff for me. I am watching an episode where the kid is failing and his his dad starts to compare him to someone else and his friends are doing well academically and I just felt this pang in my chest. That‚Äôs my childhood, never being good enough for anything, always failing after 4th grade, being bullied at school. Man even the teachers knew I was being bullied and they just made it worse for me. Then at home my mother used to scream and hit me so much that I had no place left to feel okay or safe. Then I somehow made it, I got into a good uni (like one of the best in the world) and I was better there, I realised I had c PTSD. I started getting help and then the virus happened, I was getting help after so many years of torture and then I had to leave. I had to come back to my country, to my family, and they apparently don‚Äôt hate me, it‚Äôs just me who hates me. My family doesn‚Äôt scold me anymore or scream or shout or tell me how useless I am, I mean I actually miss the beatings at least they made me feel alive. I am so addicted to pain and all of my mental illness that if I try to work on myself it gets worse for me. I am not actually stupid or dumb, I was going to enjoy this summer at uni, I was gonna enjoy my birthday after 10 years, I was excited for my birthday. Now I am here, trapped and I don‚Äôt leave my room. I have so many flashbacks and panic attacks that I have to convince my mind that the day the travel ban is lifted, I am gonna fly back to my uni and never come back. My family isn‚Äôt bad to me anymore they just wanted the best for me and then they just sort of got lost in the way and took their anger out on me when I grew up and now they aren‚Äôt angry at me, probably my siblings are taking it now. I am so tired, I just want to go away from myself away from my mind, my feelings and my head. I just want to go away forever. I want to go back to my uni and study all day and be high until I fall asleep. I miss studying, I am gonna do a math major lol am I even gonna get a job with a math major? Other than teaching?

My mother was physically abuse to me until I was strong enough to fight back and was verbally abusive until last year.

 My younger sister hated me growing up and used to hit the hell out of me and used to convince my mother that I was at fault.

I literally avoid doctors, man I had two surgeries because I tried avoiding doctors when I was sick."

I love playing sports so running normally used to help me but as my mental illness got worse and worse even cutting doesn‚Äôt help me anymore.

So I get why people think running helps and I am kind of too tired to argue with people so I just say nothing."

TrueOffMyChest,fml2dpd,t1_flxdewy,1586176770.0,"That‚Äôs not the thing, I am smart enough to get decent grades as I know the stuff in uni this year but I genuinely wanted a good score not an average score and every mark I lose on an assignment, my anxiety just makes it harder for me.


I was finally getting professional help and then covid happened. I was finally working to get my life together, I was genuinely changing but now I had to come back to my country (I am in international student) and stay with my family and it is toxic for me to stay here. I am losing my mind, my family isn‚Äôt even abusive right now, it‚Äôs just the memories that keep re surfing are not good.


 I feel like I am trapped, like I can‚Äôt breathe. I genuinely can‚Äôt breathe (it‚Äôs my anxiety) and I am talking myself down from suicide or cutting/burning myself everyday and its just exhausting man, then I have to see my mom who is one of the reason why I am pretty sure I have cptsd, depression, anxiety and anorexia. It‚Äôs just too much. 

3 weeks ago I was in Canada, at my uni studying (yeah my mental health was just as bad but I was doing something and away from most of the toxic people) and then I decided to come back. I still don‚Äôt know what tf was wrong with me when I decided to come back. I should have stayed there, atleast I wouldn‚Äôt have to be stuck here. I would rather be lonely on the campus than be here. I wish I could go back and slap myself out of the thought of coming back. I just want to go back so bad.


I never actually understood how or why people felt homesick, I think this is the most close I have been to feel homesick. I know I should stop thinking like this and accept the fact I am here and I can‚Äôt do anything about it other than wait but I am actually scared I might end up doing something to myself if I stay here."

I have had so many panic attacks since I have been back. I feel trapped. I feel like I can‚Äôt breathe. I don‚Äôt see a way out, I need an out.
