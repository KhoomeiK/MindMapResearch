nosurf,fpqp4rt,t3_gex33q,1588828279.0,"I think internet addiction rarely exists without some context to it. If you are really addicted, your addiction had a ""purpose"" for you, something you try to deal with with it. 

Something one guy in my ITAA group often says is ""I don't want to live in reality."" I feel like that expresses people's ""motivation"" to be internet addicted a lot of the time. When you are online, you don't have to deal with your life and your emotions. So, when you spend a lot of time online because you are addicted, you never deal with them and they pile up. Then, life outside the net seems even more unpleasant and you spend even more time online.

I think now that you have reduced your time online you start to get confronted with all these undealt with emotions. I am certain it is the case for a lot of people getting away from the internet.

I don't really know how to deal with them the best way, personally I like to talk/ write about them to kind of sort my emotions. But it will take time to deal with them for sure. Good luck!"

this is sadly so true

&#x200B;

As long as you are taking it slow and really taking care of your impulses and all like you said I don't think it's problematic to date someone. Have you told your therapist all the effort you are making with this new guy to start a healthy relationship with him?"
BPD,es3ji2a,t3_c5qm0q,1561563972.0,"I'm sorry you have to go through this, I can imagine it's terrible. Having somebody be on the ""stronger end"" of the relationship is something really common with having an FP I think. It must feel so terrible waiting for them to make that decision while desperately having the urge to tell them how much you miss them and wanting them back so bad. Waiting for something is always uncomfortable, it must make you so anxious feeling this.

As hard and difficult it is, the best thing to do really is focusing on yourself. Focus on your hobbies and goals and also on getting better at stuff like controlling your emotions and distress tolerance. it is not easy at all to do that and it is definitely not the comfortable situation, but I think it's what you really should do. 

I hope you can get clarity from this soon and get better!"
