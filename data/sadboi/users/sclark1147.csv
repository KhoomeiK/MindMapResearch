GRE,fqzdo13,t1_fqz9x8c,1589765185.0,"Excellent resource, thanks!"
thisisus,fkwc9mb,t3_fkhoip,1584588600.0,"I love the depth of emotion and the realistic portrayal of family dynamics on this show... but the slow plot development is bumming me out!  This entire season has been painful in that I am committed to the story and characters and want to keep watching, but every episode leaves me a little disappointed and let down. Unsure if I'm up for another season the way things stand. 

And WTF Randall! I don't hate his character at all, but the depth of his pain and psychological instability is agonizing to watch- and to think that by manipulating his mother to participate in the trial he may be adding a whole new layer to his suffering if the trial doesn't work or causes the Alzheimers to speed up. The guilt will break him and his family. Ugh... sadness all around."
thisisus,f8105zq,t1_f3cjbn1,1574144269.0,You never stop needing a parent.
thisisus,f810403,t3_dgiq6t,1574144205.0,"People change.... Miguel in his younger years very well seemed flawed (and also the end result of wishy washy writing). In his older years he seems to be pretty one dimensional, a devoted and slighted orbiting member of the Pearson clan. I hope they develop his character more in the coming year to flesh out what is a confusing character."
thisisus,f80wen2,t3_dx016l,1574140393.0,It certainly seems like he does.

depression,f0pqbfb,t3_d60j6j,1568842878.0,I feel like most people are too wrapped up in their own shit to really dig deep into mental health awareness and try to understand the reality of it.
depression,f080slz,t1_f07q7xp,1568472870.0,Can I ask what anxiety meds you take? I've only in the past to tried a few antidepressants and they didn't work for me.
depression,f08011p,t1_f07v5t3,1568472429.0,Exactly. And the sad thing is I sometimes think they're right... not that I believe it...  but other people seem to heal their depression so if I can't then something must be wrong with me that isn't depression.
depression,f07l0au,t3_d4218u,1568464330.0,"My family, all of them, absolutely do not believe in depression. I am the way I am because of my own shortcomings and not a disorder or disease and I get no empathy or consideration. It's a nightmare. I feel you."

depression,ewbr1y2,t3_cn5vlj,1565271015.0,Ugh this is me. There have been a lot of days this month I immediately wake up and start crying.
depression,ewbqx31,t3_cnj98t,1565270956.0,I wish I had an answer... all I can say is I feel the same. A therapist once told me to go through with my usual interests and hobbies like I would when I enjoyed them and the spark will come back..... eh the spark pokes through here and there but it's like there is this wall between experience and feeling and I can't break it down.
depression,ewbpvzh,t3_cnix2c,1565270494.0,"Maybe you are subconciously choosing men like your father? I've been there.... still kind of am. I'm always looking for men I have to earn attention from, like with my dad I never got his attention. 

About this conversation- is the relationship so good it's worth this shit? He sounds kind of boneheaded ..... might wanna move along."
depression,epvth5q,t3_anh7tv,1559549975.0,Been low. Terrified of where this depression flare is going. Just feels worse than usual. Hiding my tears at work is becoming a problem. I'm making mistakes at work because I'm in a funk and the overtime is exhausting me. Making me worried I'll get in trouble or lose my job.
depression,epvt23i,t3_bw1bva,1559549271.0,"A little older. I'm 32. Went to college for Park and Rec Management because I was passionate about natural conservation and tourism- Was lucky enough to get lots of grants so I only left school with $3000 in debt and quickly paid it off. My twenties was spent moving from state to state doing seasonal park jobs for minimal pay and no benefits. Long story short- it was a big waste of my time, though fun in spurts. Cut to me now- I want to go to nursing school but live alone in a town with rising rent costs, I have no friends or family here (have lived here a year and a half) and work at a hospital with a salary just above someone at Taco Bell. I take orders from people ten years younger than me who make triple my salary and while I'm only in debt $5,000- it's crushing me to the point of wanting to commit suicide rather than wake up another day completely alone in a town I can't afford at a job I hate with no hope for a better future.

So moral of the story is lighten up- your twenties are for exploring and searching- you're thirties are for suicide hotlines and Zoloft."
