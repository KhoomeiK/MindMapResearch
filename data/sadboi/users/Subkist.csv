woodworking,foge5ft,t3_g4sj5x,1587751422.0,"So I've been chatting with a friend at work and he's convinced me I need to get a nicer table saw than the \~$300 models, so I've narrowed it down to 3- but I'm not sure where to go from here. I want to do some detailed furniture work, and portability isn't really a concern so long because it won't be going anywhere except my garage. My dad used to have an old delta contractors saw, but he got rid of it for a much smaller skilsaw and he regrets it, and I don't want to end up hating whatever I get. That, and I don't want to spend more than $600 if I don't need to, but I am willing to look above that if I REALLY need to.

I'm looking at these:

* [Dewalt](https://www.lowes.com/pd/DEWALT-10-in-Carbide-Tipped-Blade-15-Amp-Portable-Table-Saw/50040968)
* [Delta](https://www.lowes.com/pd/DELTA-Contractor-Saws-10-in-Carbide-Tipped-Blade-15-Amp-Table-Saw/1001385562)
* [Metabo (Hitachi)](https://www.lowes.com/pd/Metabo-HPT-was-Hitachi-Power-Tools-10-in-Carbide-Tipped-Blade-15-Amp-Table-Saw/1001279880)

I've heard a lot of good things about the Dewalt, and with most of my tools being yellow I feel I may be biased, even though I don't want to be. The delta seems to be a contractor style, so I'm wondering if that would be better for me long term but I don't know how these fare against the folding style. Lastly, I feel like I'm cleaning furthest towards the Metabo because it's on sale right now and I could easily get another toy with the money I would be saving.

I would be very appreciative if someone could point me in the right direction as I really don't want to under-think this. Thanks in advance!"

I realize out of context those words are fairly vague- I'm talking about done heavy duty sliding rails like you would use for very heavy furniture or server rails. The things are baby to hold up heavy servers, and slid out are capable of holding a surprising amount. You're gonna be better off grabbing a standard set instead of server specific ones as they can get expensive due to them being manufactured to mount in a server rack. The furniture ones aren't bad at all. I'll see if I can find a link for you

Futurology,fn3z9n3,t1_fn3j7u5,1586630864.0,"I've worked in the oil industry for awhile before I switched to tech, and while yes it isn't cheaper, that's usually not the underlying issue. The issue is the EPA is corrupt as shit. They have all these fines and regulations, but they really don't care about the environment so long as you pay the fine. And the fines aren't logical, they're political. Take for instance a well in the Mississippi Delta. The ecosystem is largely farm flatlands with the occasional bayou running through. The well must be surrounded by a fire wall (dirt wall) that's capable of holding a day and a half of production plus 150%  the capacity of the storage devices on site (I can't remember the exact numbers but that's semantics- it's a safety factor of ""hold more in than it needs to"").

Typically in these areas they are extremely salt water heavy, and when I say salt water I mean extremely salty. Ocean water is around 3.5% (35000 ppm) salt, whereas the stuff that comes out of these wells can get up to 45% (450,000). That shit is gonna kill whatever Flora it gets spilled on. Plus nothing will grow there again in your life time, unless you replace the soil. Well the EPA doesn't care about that shit. That's a slap on the wrist (literally, it's almost inconsequential). But if you spill a drop off oil into that waterway, and the EPA sees it? They're making you put on the highest level of PPE and going to spend days making you scrub the site, and then you're going to have a 6-7 digit fine plus lawsuits coming your way. That's the difference between 1000 barrels of salt water vs a gallon of oil. The one that does the actual environment damage on orders of magnitude more than the oil, is fine orders of magnitude less than the oil- even if said oil ""spill"" could be cleaned up with a roll of shop towels. It's fucking ridiculous. 

Now, I've only worked for smaller companies, but those are owned by locals and they all care about the land they're working on because it's the land many of them live on. They don't want to see their beautiful backyard trashed. So they take care of it. They are extremely careful not to pollute or harm their surroundings. It's the big guys like Chevron, Exxon, or shell that you have to worry about, because they have the money to throw at the EPA. And it's sad how the laws are written too because a lot of the smaller companies will buy older wells off the big guys, because they don't care about getting the most production out of a well that they can, they just want the initial 3-5 year primary production. Well these but guys don't really give a shit so an oversight or fuck up they set in motion 40 years ago that's now owned by the little guy is thrown in the little guy. A lot of those instances can ruin a family owned company. 

I've seen the EPA fine PEOPLE hundreds of thousands of dollars for putting the wrong color generator (yeah, that thing you have in your garage) on forms. 

The EPA doesn't care about you, or the environment, or the animals that live there. The EPA cares about your wallet and how much control it can gain over you and how many politicians it can buddy up with. Fuck the EPA. They're corrupt as shit."
