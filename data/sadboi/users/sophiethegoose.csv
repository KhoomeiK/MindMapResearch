depressed,fqyqsyg,t3_gljgas,1589753018.0,"Hey ❤️ just wanted to say that everything you're feeling is totally valid and not entitled or selfish! I also struggle with a feeling of always chasing things to find satisfaction and feeling like I'll never reach it. But I hope you can find at least glimpses of happiness, even in the smallest of places, and you keep on keeping on :)"

depression,fqaeirr,t1_fq8ps8b,1589217712.0,"I agree! I am depressed a lot of the time but am still, in ways, fairly optimistic. Mainly about short-term or more trivial things. But I find it hard to be optimistic about the future and the bigger picture."
DearEvanHansen,fqadcyk,t1_fq8cul2,1589217148.0,"I think Cynthia being distant from Connor was not really due to her neglecting him - I'd say she was actually quite focused on trying to ""fix"" Connor (while he was growing more distant) and so Zoe felt neglected. But in the cut song ""in the bedroom down the hall"", it mentions her getting Connor to see counsellors and ""the cures a mother tries"". I think she was trying to help, but didn't know how."

DearEvanHansen,fq29u8i,t3_ggeiuz,1589054137.0,"You can do both at the same time! Someone made a list of songs with corresponding pages of the book so you can listen to the songs in context of the story :)

depressed,fpv4nfq,t3_gfop6e,1588934742.0,"Hi there, just wanted to reach out and say - what you're feeling is completely understandable, and it's hard to keep going when you find no meaning in things. But know that you are inherently worth SO much. Please hold on, people are rooting for you!"
