AskReddit,ewqecle,t3_cpipwq,1565663674.0,"Okay,so it's like 5 months ago,
My uncle came to visit my family
I,of course didn't greet them because I can't get out of my comfort zone
But my family pushed me so I got out n said hello

After a few pointless talking, he,my uncle,complain about why i don't socialize enough with my family (they,including my family, don't know i have problems n i don't like sharing it)
So i just sat there silently n was so pissed off i might cry
It takes about 1 hour of ranting?his face was the face of someone with relieve while I am masking my pissed off face with a smile
Highlight of the ranting was ""yeah,I've been like you but I can endure it like a boss"" and ""don't be like this,be hppy you have many years to live"" AND ""You teenagers are not like us in the 70s,we played outdoors,socialize n think about our future"" AND ""StAy PoSiTiVe""
How people treat me is different from what people treat you n happiness doesn't come easily
With all the things i've been through,you have the balls to say that?yeah great.
Well i'm at the wrong too cause i don't tell that i'm depressed but oh well"
