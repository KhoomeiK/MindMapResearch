internetparents,fr4qz8v,t3_gmhbfb,1589895092.0,"Hey kiddo,

Before we dive into this hole, I want to clear up a few things. Consider them ground rules: foundations for where we’re beginning.

1) your father is not ‘possibly’ mentally ill. He is mentally ill. It’s not something to be upset or embarrassed about. It’s like a physical illness, in that it gets worse if you don’t treat it, and gets better if you do. Everyone will get a ‘mental cold’ at some point but there are other people who get perpetually ill. It doesn’t matter which your father is, it’s important to recognize that his brain and heart are sick, and not to dodge around it

2) your father’s depression began way earlier than you think. Depression begins before symptoms show. Likely, the depression began before his divorce with your mother. That better explains how and why he would have given up on a dream. If he wasn’t ill before, then he would be more likely to have continued the pursuit for a sense of ‘normalcy.’ It also better explains why he would have had an affair. EDIT: (I’m leaving in the affair part even though I now realize that it may not have been an actual affair. I misread when you said he possibly fathered a son as an illegitimate relationship. Please excuse me if I’m wrong)

3) you can have a relationship with your father in many, many, many capacities while still setting hard, strict, and impassable boundaries. You can love him and still put up walls and set lines. There is no mutual exclusiveness between ‘I love my father’ and ‘I cannot be around him.’

You may think I’m getting nit picky with your words or phrases, but I promise that it matters. The words people use show a deeper implication than I think they understand. You weren’t thinking and planning what you were going to type out, so it was from the heart. Therefore, every word you wrote is a true reflection of how you see the situation. These little nitpicks show me the perspective that you have that are at odds with the whole picture. Please recognize that this is not a fault in you, but an inevitability for being part of the situation. That’s why you ask for help, is it not? 

Okay now the meat. Firstly, I want to congratulate you for thinking rationally through this. It can be extremely tough to see a parent in a vulnerable spot. As children, we see our parents as pillars of idealism. They represent all that we mentally attribute to stability and expectation. They are our constant, and become the definition of ‘adult’ for better or worse. The day that a child sees their parents as human instead of ideal is a sobering one, and the earlier it happens, the earlier the world loses its luster. To have your brother experience that at 11 is admittedly young, but not young enough for it not to be a teachable moment. 

Your father is in an exceptionally vulnerable place, as he has been for a while. He wants someone: anyone or anything, to fix it. He likely believes he is a catalyst for the poor things that have gone on in his life. He probably believes himself unworthy and undeserving, and spending time with you is a reflection of a life he believes he let slip away. To him, just seeing his children happy and stable is a reminder of his failings, stemming from a fulcrum of your mother. You didn’t do anything wrong, you’re the representations in his mind of a wonderful world he let slip through his fingers.

The worst part? He’s probably right. This probably is his fault. And he’s going to have to make peace with that. He made the decisions he made, and he regrets them. But he’s going to have to set up, and realize that he cannot undo those mistakes: only learn from them. You cannot tell or teach him how to do that. He’s going to have tighten his bootstraps to do it himself. It will be the hardest thing he’s ever done, but he won’t heal without recognizing that making a mistake is part of life. And until that moment, your presence doesn’t seem to be a wholly positive one for him. 

I think it’s most important right now to care for your sibling. They’re the victim more than anyone right now, because they had no say or influence in the negative emotions that are going on. I think what’s best is putting up limitations between you and your siblings and your father. You can, and most definitely should, maintain a relationship with your father. Spend some time with him. Make memories, and share your feelings. But, as with any mentally ill and untreated person, you need to know when the right time is to step up and assist, and when to step away.

As the resident adult with a sound mind, you have the unfortunate and horrid responsibility of being the mediator. You need to be able to judge when your father is no longer healthy for your siblings to be around, and find a way to set up barriers. This could be a conversation topic (‘we are here now, so we don’t talk about mom, because she isn’t here. Period.’) or a duration (‘I learn if dad has a beer or two he becomes too caught up in himself, and so either dad doesn’t drink, or he goes to his own room if he can’t help it.’) but these limits need to be hard and fast, and without exception. You then become the example your siblings have, so that they can also set limitations with your father habitually, and grow and nurture their own relationship without having to think about these limitations. 

Your father also needs help. Badly. No human can do this alone. I’m a firm believer that everyone can benefit from a person to confide in. While I prefer the arm’s length separation of my therapist (who I have grown to love as a human, as he does me) perhaps your father can begin his growth and healing with someone he cares about instead of someone more distant. I think, when you’re ready, you can broach that topic with him. Let him know that him getting help doesn’t make you love him any less, and if anything you would be more proud of him to be brave enough to ask for assistance. Perhaps his mother; or his affair partner can be that confident. Otherwise, I know a lot of therapists are still open and busy in the new online world of today, as Covid has only increased peoples recognition that their mental health has been stable only by habit, instead of strength.

The path ahead is going to be hard, kiddo. But nothing worth it in life is easy. It’s important that during this time, no matter how far apart or close together these lines you set are, that you hold fast to them. And find someone to talk to. I can feel the hurt you have behind these letters, and it’s not fair for you to have to swallow your fathers pain and your own.

Best of luck."

Wow I am seeing people attempting to give advice that just borders on misogyny. It hurts inside. 

Let me try and give you some advice, knowing that no amount of advice is going to make this go away. This is going to be work, and you’re going to have to keep working at it for a while. 

First off, your Significant other chose you. Every female friend he has is another person that he could have chosen, and didn’t. Every female friend is a person he has a connection with, and still comes back to you. When he tells you you’re beautiful, he does it knowing what every one of those women look and act like. And when he tells you you’re funny, or smart, or wonderful, he does it knowing everything that they bring to the table as well. And yet he chooses you. Every day. 

Secondly, how does he feel about your male friends? Old childhood people you knew from a different age? The memories you share that aren’t romantic or sexual in any way? You’d get pretty upset if he was angry every time you wanted to continue friendships with them. Because in the end, friendship isn’t determined by sex or gender, but by intellect and humor. If you’re focusing a friendship on what a persons hiding under their clothes, then it was never really a friendship to begin with

And finally, I want you to look at why you’re upset. Are you upset because you think they look better? Are you afraid of the time he shares with them? Are you afraid in losing emotional intimacy? Share these fears with your boyfriend, and allow him to support you in those fears. Let him know that you have those fears, and that you are working through learning not to be jealous. And tell him that in those moments, you need his help in reassuring you. And then be comfortable being uncomfortable."

You two need some time away from each other.

As you said, mental illness is stepping in between you two. And when put under stress, your first instinct was to run. Is it good, is it bad? Who knows. But your fight or flight instinct kicked in, and your heart told you where to find comfort. It is not with this boy. 

Your boyfriend sounds sweet, and concerned, and a hair clueless. He seems to be logical, and look several steps ahead without consultation. He believes that giving you things is an expression of his love, and hopes that you remember those THINGS as points of stability that his love is not something that can just vanish. A lot of men are, actually. Whether it’s good or bad is irrelevant. It is what it is, and we’re not here to talk about whether it’s good or not.

You, are emotional. Your heart guides your actions and intentions. You feel your way through confusion, and trust your gut will see you through. 

People who process the world differently CAN work together, but only if both parties are willing to step outside of comfort to see how the other views the world. He needs the ability to see when you’re stressed that logic is secondary, and you need to see that what’s in front of you is not the end of the tunnel. You’re both young, and need some time to look into that.

Living together is really done well with two humans who are secure with who they are, and can begin melding their habits and problems together as a unit. But, like a sandwich, or falls apart if one of those pieces of bread isn’t cooked, you can’t be a stable unit if one of you is still trying to rise.

This relationship CAN work, but you need to work on you first. And when you can finally feel secure in yourself, then you can work on living together. So start back at the beginning. Begin talking to him again, then act like a relationship. But move slowly. Don’t move farther or faster than your anxiety allows. You’ll get there one of these days. But not today, kiddo."
relationship_advice,fqft3w6,t3_gic71d,1589331165.0,"Hey kiddo,

This sort of shit from your wife is beyond petty. She’s a grown adult, and has been for a while. There’s absolutely no excuse for her to act like a child. This kind of intention dig, to leverage an intentionally damaging truth during an argument showcases the same immaturity that most teenagers have. This woman has probably said other absolutely horrid things to you over the years. If not to your face, then at least behind your back.

However, I want this post to be a post of reassurance. 

I want you to go up to your eldest. Sit her down and ask her an honest question. ‘What do you call me?’ 99% she will say ‘dad’ and be confused. But the confusion is irrelevant. The answer is the important part. She will call you dad.

This is because being a father is not a product of correctly ejaculating. Being a father is a choice of dedication and emotional investment into the growth and nourishment of a child as they grow into this world. Biology is irrelevant. Nurture is fatherhood, nature is siring 

Your oldest is an adult now. One who understands infidelity, and that love is more complicated than waiting for Prince Charming to kiss you awake from slumber. When you sit her down, and ask her, be prepared to tell her the truth. ‘Would you still think of me as your dad if I wasn’t your biological father?’ 

It’s important that when your oldest finds out (because she will) that she knows that YOU still love HER. You still see her as your child, and I’m positive she still sees you as her father. Why? Because she still knows that you were the one that sat her bedside. You attended her concerts, her baseball games, her hobbies that seemed to come and go like the wind. You held her after heartbreak, and helped her move in to college. Those are all things that the man who ejaculated in her mother did not do. And so while it may be his dna, it’s not his daughter. 

Why would the younger ones be any different? Did you not change their diapers? Did you not hold them crying? Did you not witness their first words? Their first steps? Don’t they call you dad too? If so, you’re still their father. 

The only choice you have in this is whether the woman who birthed them is still your wife. Being a husband or wife is a choice. It looks like your wife cares not for those responsibilities. But being your childrens father does not need marriage to complete. You are still their dad regardless of whether you’re married to your wife still.

Long story short; regardless of the conception of your children, they are still your children, and your wife can’t take that from you. No matter how hard she tries."
DMAcademy,fqdphlo,t1_fqdowu4,1589294291.0,"If I do it right she will love it. She is constantly afraid of her patron taking her powers away, so having the power be innately hers is a validation that no one can take anything from her"
DMAcademy,fqdlrit,t3_giah7a,1589292285.0,"I’ll take a risk, knowing at least one of my players is on reddit. If your name is Sophie, Daian, Juara or Red, please keep the secrets secret. If you spoil it, it’s on yourself.


One of my players is a Warlock Pact of the Fiend. We spent a lot of time pre-campaign working on her patron, why she would have found them, and the moment that she would have signed the deal. The family she is part of has always signed deals with this specific Devil, forfeiting their own souls; and offering the souls of their children in order to gain the power to reverse curses and diseases. The kind of ‘evil to create good’ vibe. It’s a family secret, and while all of the family inevitably gets into the contract, part of the new contract involves placing their children in great mortal danger in order to entice them to call out to these demon and sign their own contract. 

However, the moment that Sophie signed the contract was the first one that was completely on her own. She was nowhere near her family, and only snooping around her father’s restricted books gave her the name of this devil, and the potential of power. She signed the contract with no family members to barter with, and therefore has taken a deal that in order to save a life, she must forfeit another to this Devil patron. 

However, here’s the twist. The moment that Sophie signed this contract was during a cult ritual that the player thinks was unsuccessful. She believes the ritual was unsuccessful because the latent power of the Devil protected her, killing each cult member and stealing their souls for his own evil schemes. This, is the point of the ruse. This never happened. In actuality, the ritual was incredibly successful, and Sophie is slowly transforming into an avatar of Dendar, the Night Serpent. One of the priests used Modify Memory, making Sophie believe she had called upon a higher power, and killed them, so that they could stalk her progress from afar without issue or suspicion. 

The truth is that the Devil patron doesn’t exist. The player character’s family has never made a deal, and don’t know what Sophie would be talking about, and the magic that Sophie believes is coming from a patron is truly coming from herself. She is a sorcerer, utilizing the skill set of a Warlock because she has self-limited herself to it. The patron that Sophie has made up is an old imaginary friend she had when she was a child, that she morphed into a ‘Devil’ because her fiancé is a Tiefling. If she returns home and directly inquired about the patron, her parents will look nervous and upset, but only because they are afraid that their daughter, now in her mid 20s, still cannot let go of the imaginary friend she had as a child. I am hoping this will distract her well enough with the insecurity that she will read it as parental worry with a family-patron. 

Inevitably, if she doesn’t figure it out, I plan to have the Devil patron face Sophie, and use identical powers as she does. If she defeats him, she will learn that he lives within her, and always have. If she loses, the shade of herself will laugh and tell her that she cannot even win against her own fears, before retreating in the shadows. In the end, I’m waiting her her to have a crisis before teaching her that her power is her own, and no one else’s."

Look, being intimidated by other men, bigger or smaller, is a self confidence thing. It really doesn’t have anything to do with them, but with your brain using them as a reflection of your sense of self. 

It has less to do with you thinking they are big, and more with thinking you are small. This can happen regardless of your size, or your sex, or gender. Self image doesn’t care what you actually look like, only what you convince yourself you look like. And it can only be gained by you. 

Here’s my recommendation, sport. Start working out. Seriously. Build up the muscles that make you feel strong. It’s really a trick, kiddo. Building up muscles will start to make you feel more secure in your body, will show you that persistence pays off, and will teach you that the body that you’re given is not the one you make. You in your heart are a man, and that’s well and good. But irrelevant. You can sculpt the body you wear to look exactly as you picture yourself: and then you’ll soon realize that how tall you are, how muscled you are, and how your hair is styled is really irrelevant. Toxic masculinity has taught us men that your worth is determined by what’s on the outside. But once you are comfortable with what you look on the outside, you can begin to realize that it’s what is on the inside that matters.

Besides, as strange as it sounds, the gym is surprisingly a good place where everyone there, male or female, is there simply to better themselves, and sculpt themselves towards feeling better. You may find that there are other men lifting there, big and small, who can help you find the body that makes you comfortable. 

Start on the outside, and then realize the outside doesn’t mean squat as opposed to the inside. Does that make sense kiddo?"
relationship_advice,fq9rllt,t3_ghlm90,1589205590.0,"Hey kiddo,

I want to start by expressing empathy for you. Anxiety is very real, and can be emotionally consuming. It can feel like someone is squeezing your heart, and claws are scratching at you. The fear and anticipation is all consuming, and it doesn’t appear that your boyfriend respects that.

Actually, it seems like your boyfriend doesn’t understand it. It can be hard for people who do not have a mental disorder to understand what it feels like. One of the positives about Mental Illness Normality is that we can talk about it more openly and honestly. The problem then becomes that the words are overused. People use ‘depression’ when they mean upset or bummed. They use ‘Anxiety’ when they mean nervous or on edge, and use ‘OCD’ when they mean detail oriented. As such, it has kind of taken the ‘importance’ out of these serious illnesses, and nullified what they really entail. 

It looks like your boyfriend has assumed that your very real anxiety is more of ‘nervousness,’ taking the normalization of the word at its colloquial value instead of its seriousness. I don’t think he really values that anxiety is serious, and that what you have is actual anxiety, not nervousness. Not killing this bug is a symptom, not a cause. The real cause is ‘not trusting your house is safe, that he will protect you, that he respects your fears and needs.’ The bug is just the catalyst. I mean, if you can’t trust him to do something as simple as killing a bug without getting distracted, what if it was something serious? 

I don’t think he understands that this isn’t about the bug. This is about what the bug represents. A clear, concise and easy to complete task that you needed him to do. It was easy, and it was simple, and he still couldn’t do it. He’s probably looking at this at straight face value. Wondering why a bug would be so important and disbelieving that something so simple could trigger something that has such respectable power as anxiety. As such, I’m sure he’s deduced that you don’t have a ‘real’ anxiety, but instead are just overreacting about a minor fear and blowing it out of proportion. I think you’ve explained what triggers you, and what that causes, but haven’t really set the foundation of what that MEANS. You’re talking to him about step 2, when he doesn’t have a ground in which to begin that. Talk to him first about what it means to have anxiety. Why it matters. Why it’s serious. Why it’s real, and that a bug is a symbol, not a cause. 

I think you two need to have a serious conversation about respect. Does he honestly respect your requests? Does he value doing a simple act that takes only a few seconds over whatever would have taken that time? And if those few seconds are so very valuable to him, how can you trust that something serious will be taken with respect? 

In my opinion, you need to be able to get him to understand that this isn’t about the bug. If he can’t look beyond the surface, then he will never understand your underlying emotions. And if he doesn’t understand that, then he will never have a deep and intimate emotional connection. And isn’t that what having a partner is all about anyways? If he can’t do that, he’s really just a glorified fuck buddy. And you deserve more than that. 

Just my two cents"
internetparents,fpwukhp,t1_fpwrv1g,1588970241.0,"First off, you didn’t do anything wrong. People grow apart. They grow cold. They grow tired. Many of these reasons on his own. Casting yourself into fault is just a way for you to feel like you can have control over it. Let go of that impulse. It’s simply not realistic. 

Secondly, there is no such thing as ‘wasting’ a time. Time passes, and how we use it is irrelevant of whether it moves or not. Therefore whether time was wasted or not is a reflection of societal expectations, which are all shit anyways. You spent last year surviving, and coping with a brain that was spending most of its time expressing how hurt you are, and just making it say to say. That in itself is a lot of work, but not work that you can show anyone else. It’s the foundation to a plain building. 

2020 is a shit year for us all. The pandemic brings the strains of stress, relationship trouble, insecurity, and every terrible emotion we tried to bury under a guise of ‘productivity and worth’ that is a terrible construct of the culture we live in. You matter and have worth because you believe you do and for no other reason. But you can’t begin believing that until you stop caring what others think. 

And honestly, you won’t feel better right away. There may even be some time where you think you feel worse. And then one morning, without explanation, you’ll remember JUST how shitty you felt in the past, and you’ll realize that happiness, like aging, happens in imperceptible baby steps. 

So here’s my challenge to you for the coronavirus. Try and find a place you want to be. Somewhere brand new. Somewhere that makes you feel brand new. Tell me when you find that place. And look HARD. I’m really excited for when you find it."
internetparents,fpwpiqy,t3_gfvxg8,1588967610.0,"Hey kiddo,

I remember being 25. It’s a tough age. And by tough age I mean fucking ruthless. You’re old enough to be an adult, but you don’t have the excuses of being 18-22 any more. You’re expected to find a job, get married, and start pumping out babies, and anyone or anything that stands between that is an offense to those who helped you grow: even if it’s not their or your fault.

Here’s the thing you learn with age. No one knows what the fuck is going on. This whole world is a big mess. There’s barely a rhyme or reason, there’s no playbook to when you should do something by when, and your parents barely know much more than you do. And that... that’s a good thing. 

Hear me out. Right now, I hear that you feel detached. You feel unconnected, and untethered. This manifests in you as depression. You long for meaningful relationships, and a ‘meaning’ to life. I’m sorry to tell you that there is no true meaning to life. Nothing beyond spending your days chasing happiness. 

But, there are those who have their rings of marriage, their children on the way, their promotions lined up, who feel eerily similar to you as well. They feel tired out, and locked into a life that moved without their choice. They crave freedom and hope to detach themselves from parents who cling, places with roots, and jobs without leeway. They want what you have. 

But it doesn’t really look so swell from your point of view, right? Grass is always greener... as they say. 

What I’m going to tell you right now is a pipe dream for most. It might even seem far fetched for you, but I promise if you start today, it’s possible. You are in a perfect place in your life to pick up everything you ever care about and move. Leave the parents who don’t respect you, the ex boyfriend who takes out his own insecurities on you (conversation for another time) and find a place that makes you feel brand new. You aren’t old enough yet that you can’t remake yourself, and you’re not too young that you will have difficulty beginning to start again. In uprooting yourself, and finding a place that makes you feel a certain way, you’ll find that doing the daily chores we all cycle through becomes a little easier, and a little easier, until you kind of enjoy it. You may find someone who loves you who isn’t at all attached to your shitty ex, and the you you want to be will be within your grasp. 

I’m not saying it will be easy. In fact, it will be really hard. But, I know the pain of wishing an artery rupturing in your brain to relieve you of the crippling desire to end this miserable existence. I didn’t uproot myself until it was too late. I was too old to make friends again. I was too connected to ever really leave my home town behind. And so I didn’t last. I was pulled back, and made peace with that.

But you, if you are unsatisfied, then nothing can stop you from going somewhere beautiful. Somewhere where the cruel words of your parents can’t reach, and where when your ex inevitably tries to reach back, you are the reason he can’t. 

Remember, when you have nothing to lose, you can do anything. And you are at the right time to take the world in your palm. I’m excited for you"

Here’s the thing with alcoholism: no alcoholic knows they are one. They justify it by making comparisons, excuses, and denial. Because no one Wants To be an alcoholic, they’ll just say they drink often, or heavily. Or maybe just lie and say average. There’s a lot of excuses alcoholics will make, but until they recognize they are one, they will never seek help. 

I’m not saying you are one, but at whats the threshold that makes a person one? Is it 2 drinks a day? 4? 9? What counts as a drink? 9 beers may be too much, but what about 3 glasses of scotch? 

You can’t put a number on it, so I usually say it’s a problem as soon as you believe you can’t do anything without it. And I think you’re starting to skirt that line between habit and addicting. 

The question I would begin to ask yourself is ‘why?’ Why do I want this drink? Why do I need it to sleep? Can I sleep without it? And if not... maybe I need to talk to someone about why I need alcohol in order to complete functions other people can do with out it. 

Alcohol is a wonderful recreational drug. In moderation it can lower inhibitions, and be a wonderful social lubricant.  It can taste wonderful, and pair well with unique flavors. I love alcohol, but the moment I feel like I ‘need it’ I have to wonder why I’m leveraging any situation on having it.

What I would do is try substituting your ritual alcohol with something less potent. A drink every once in a while is fine, but substitute it with a soda, or a tea. Try non-alcoholic drinks, until you can begin accomplishing tasks that don’t need the alcohol. Remember, you are not your dependence, but your dependence can change you.

I’m proud of you for reaching out before it became a problem. You’re wiser than most, and there’s plenty of room to make sure you can still enjoy the things in life without letting them change you. Best of luck."

Your brother is a rapist. The end. Your parent accept it because it ‘gets them down.’ But they’re choosing to ignore it. If they have their way, it will disappear. You will be forgotten, the worst crime you can commit to a human being being lost to blissful ignorance.

This is something that destroys people. Panic attacks, anxiety, and even suicide because of the fallout. Your parents don’t care. They get ‘bummed’ and ‘down.’ But, do they get down when you talk about the symptoms you talk about? Your parents are being selfish. They are refusing to acknowledge that you want to set limits against your rapist. Would they have done the same if your rapist wasn’t family? Would they have told you to make connections, forgive and forget, if it was some random stranger? Of course not. 

That person is your brother, but has forfeited family when he assaulted you. He is your rapist and nothing else. Treat him the same way you would have if he wasn’t your brother. He is your rapist first, and your family second. One of them he chose, that’s the one you treat him as. 

Set whatever boundaries you feel okay with. And if your parents don’t respect it, set boundaries with them too. You have no obligation to give forgiveness you aren’t ready to. Even if you are the asshole, you’re in the right, and that matters more.

Before going through with this, think about it. It might be a pipe dream; and it might not be possible. But, if you’re truly beating yourself up so much over it: you may have another way out.

First off, get your mother’s ring. You have plenty of time for it to be polished, and reset, because you aren’t on a time crunch. Make sure it’s perfect, and exactly the heirloom you were dreaming about.

Secondly, take her on another trip. Nothing huge, but somewhere you’d take her on a date that has personal, and real memorable significance to you. A park you had a picnic, the lightpost you first kissed by. A coffee shop you saw her for the first time, even before you ever had the courage to ask her out. Every couple has this place, but not every couple find it. Take her there, and tell her how much you love her, and how much you value her. How you respect the patience she has with you, and how she is willing to love you despite your mistakes and your flaws.

Finally, propose again. Seriously. If you’re worried about how it looks, try again. You already knew she would say yes when you proposed the first time, and you know she’ll say yes now. Except this time, she won’t see it coming at all. And with the heirloom, it’ll show that it has personal significance. But this time, don’t just say ‘will you marry me’ tell her honestly ‘will you take me for all of my flaws: all of my impulses that show up poorly. For every mistake I make to show you how much I love you. THIS is how I want you to remember me proposing, not the first mistake I made. Will you take me trying again and again to make you proud, with this, with love, and with everything else?’

Buddy, show her that she doesn’t have to settle with what you put on the table if it isn’t enough. Show her when you make a mistake you’re willing to make it better. And honestly you can make proposing to her a new tradition. Do it every year, or whenever you look at her and wonder ‘how did I get this lucky,’ or whenever you have a new gift to give her. 

I’m expecting not everyone will like this, but advice doesn’t have to just be ‘move on.’ If you don’t want to, or don’t think you can, try again! Proposals are an expression of love, not a formal stepping stone, who says you can’t do it twice?"

relationship_advice,fpgixt9,t3_gdbk5d,1588603621.0,"Hey kiddo,

I think the disconnect here is about the difference in both of you as to your opinion of what ‘his child’ means. To you, it means passing on his genetic material, his biological history, and all of the things that make him physically his, and how they mix together with another human’s biology to create new and unique life. It’s a beautiful thing we can do as mortals, and conception should never be taken lightly. 

But I think he considers it something different. To him, raising a child is the emotional connection you have to creating and cultivating how a new human experiences and interprets the world. It is a more emotional connection than a physical one. And honestly, he seems like he’d be a great father for an adopted child. In that vein, he really isn’t raising a child, he’s just giving this couple the only thing they can’t biologically create on their own.

You have a disconnect because you want both the physical and emotional experience of creating and raising a child to be a unique experience that you can cultivate together. You want this to be new for BOTH of you, you don’t want to see a child that looks like the man you love grow up being loved by someone else. To him, you’re threatening to leave him over something that is akin to simply masterbating and having someone raise the goo in the tissue. I understand both of your points of view, but I think each of you fails to recognize the importance of the other.

I would have a serious discussion with him about the commitment he wants to make to the growing of this child. Make him aware that the child may want to know about him when they grow up, and you aren’t comfortable knowing that he could grow an emotional connection to a pseudo-family that doesn’t involve you. You love him and want any family he has to include you. But also recognize that the sperm he donates isn’t yours. He can do whatever he would like with it, and will have to live with whatever consequences come with it: whether it be an uncomfortable stain on a towel, or an uncomfortable family. Unless he is treading into emotional affairs by merging his life with his coworker’s, he isn’t cheating on you, and he isn’t hiding a child from you. 

I understand your uncomfortable-ness as well though. Your loved one is making a permanent decision without even thinking about you. Talk to him about why he didn’t think as to your feelings, but recognize that he doesn’t HAVE to tell you what he does with his body, the same way you don’t HAVE to tell him what you do with your body. 

Also be aware that you’re very young. As much as I love happy endings and true love, the person I was dating at 19 who I thought I would spend my life with has been away from my life for years. I hope that this relationship lasts, but the only way it is going to is if you begin to recognize that you cannot control his actions, he begins to recognize that his actions have an impact on you: no matter how distant it feels from you. He is beginning to take on the permanent decisions that come with adulthood, and can no longer do as he pleases while only considering himself. But you have to recognize that just because you want something doesn’t mean it will happen. He has fully rights to continue doing this, and you leaving him won’t stop him. If you’re uncomfortable, please leave him so you can find someone who also wants to share the physical aspects that come with raising a child, and let him find someone who believes that raising a child is about a connection, not biology."

relationship_advice,fovbjdv,t3_g9pobk,1588098564.0,"Hey kiddo,

I’m gonna take the devil’s advocate approach here. I know it’s not the typical route of r/relationship_advice but I think the first step towards healing this is coming to a mutual understanding of where you are both at emotionally. As he is not on here, nor asking the questions, I can really only talk to you. I sincerely hope you read this and think about it before taking any steps forward

I want you to try and imagine how he is feeling. Two people in his life have died. Forever. They aren’t coming back. There is no second chance. This isn’t a pet, where your memories of an ending are preluded by age, and often the release of suffering. This isn’t his parents, which we all recognize will die before us, and we spend our whole lives preparing for. This is a friend. The person you choose to spend time with for the rest of your life. Friends grow old together, or grow apart. But his didn’t. They died. No goodbye, no last words. Gone.

Your boyfriend, due to this, has spiraled into a depression. It’s obvious based on his poor hygiene, his binge eating habits, and his lack of emotional response. Now, for those of you who think depression is just being sad and VERY sad, I regret to inform you that you’re wrong. Depression is an emotional black hole. It takes your feelings of joy, your feelings of rage, of jealousy, desire, anticipation, and even anguish and consumes them. There is nothing left. You are empty and void. There is nothing that gives you pleasure, nor anything you allow to give you pain. It is a defensive tool for keeping your heart safe while you cope and heal. Some people will heal during this time, and others... never will. They have to accept that or else they risk never escaping from the void of emotions. It can be tempting for those who have felt great loss to stay in that void: after all, what can hurt you if you never get attached? Coming out of that will be his journey. It may take a month, a year, a decade, or the rest of his life. He will have to choose.

But during this time, you are focused on you. I certainly can’t blame you. It’s the best advice most people can give; only you can control you. But I think you’re taking it a hair far. In all the posts relating to your relationship with your boyfriend and his depression, I have seen very little where you go out of your way to try and help him on this journey. This doesn’t necessarily mean you aren’t, but your posts here are often more along the lines of ‘I need this from him and he can’t give it.’ Why there is nothing wrong with that, I want you to imagine your requests from his point of view.

He is trying not to emotionally collapse as he deals with the loss of two people he loves, and a third person is asking him to give love in a way he currently isn’t comfortable with. When confronted, he shuts down, because to be emotionally vulnerable right now is to risk losing the mild progress he has made in coping with this loss. As this subreddit has said countless times ‘you cannot judge what a loss means to each person, because each person feels a loss differently.’ While this sentiment is usually to humans whose partners want them to get over a loss they themselves have gone over, I want to use it here. Because you’re the partner who wants your boyfriend to move on faster than he wants to right now.

This is grounds for breaking up, if you want to. You could leave and find someone who can satisfy you in the way you’re asking for. You will feel loved by a person who can respond to your needs right now. No one could blame you for doing so. But before you do, imagine you’re in his shoes. You lost someone you love, and he breaks up with you for not wanting to have sex with him. 

That he forgot your birthday seriously sucks. It really does. It isn’t fair to you that a day celebrating your existence is lost on a person who is focusing on their own right now. But does that celebration mean as such to you as the bond you share in helping him become emotionally stable again? There is no right answer, but if your answer is yes: you two aren’t compatible. You need someone who responds more to you, and he needs someone who can be more independent. It’s not a bad thing, just different.

Think about it, before you do anything. And be steadfast in your answer. If you leave him, know it’s for you: the only person who will always be here for you. But if you stay, know it’s for him, and the bond you share.

Curious to see what happens. Good luck."

internetparents,fokmfpk,t3_g7zvuq,1587844808.0,"Hey kiddo,

Your resentment is understandable, as a victim of abuse seeing someone you care about also suffering through abuse is definitely something you would react to. 

That being said, you cannot control the relationship he has with his parents. You can only control the relationship you have with him, and the relationship you have with his parents. Trying to control the relationship he has with anyone isn’t too dissimilar to what his parents are doing. So let’s focus on how to help your relationships so that you can begin to distance yourself from abusive people, without having to say ‘this relationship is over because of people who are not us.’

In terms of your relationship with his parents. The cruel things they say to you and ways they act are only symptomatic of their own problems, as I’m sure you’ve surmised. Those horrid things the say and do are only reflections of how they think about themselves and each other. They direct it at you to avoid having to face the reality that they are flawed and do not like themselves. The best thing you can do is ignore them (obviously easier said than done.) You aren’t forced to have a relationship with them, so any time they direct their abusive tendencies toward you, just shut down. Don’t acknowledge them. Don’t acknowledge what they’ve said. They’ll get frustrated, and that only proves that they’re only doing it to feel power over a person they can’t control. 

As for your relationship with your boyfriend, it’s important for you to recognize that he’s probably not ready to detach from the constant of the poor relationship that is there. So, the time you spend with him should be spent to the fullest, and you cannot blame him for the time he can’t spend with you. He likely already feels bad enough as it is, the last thing he needs is to feel guilted from the other person he cares about in his life. 

There may be a time in the future where your boyfriend comes to you for emotional stability. It’s then that you’ll have to make a choice of whether you can care for that without forfeiting the work you’ve done on you. That will be the real test of this relationship. Things beyond that like children and marriage are too far in the future for you to really bet on. You can really only focus on the NOW and the near future. Work on that before you build on children. 

I think the relationship is salvageable as long as you can separate your relationship with him from your relationship with his parents, if not physically than at least emotionally. If you cannot do so, leave him now so he can find a way to be independent on his own.

I hope that helped some, kiddo"
internetparents,fokkmsu,t3_g7ymd3,1587843831.0,"Hey kiddo,

Don’t let anyone tell you what you can and can’t believe. There are a million things we are learning about the world every day. The world we knew yesterday is nowhere near the same as today. At anytime, anyone could discover ANYTHING and completely change how the world is thought of. Just because you cannot see it doesn’t mean it isn’t there. 

That being said, every culture has depictions of their own Father Christmas. Some say he is a Christian saint, while others just a giving jolly man. And yet those same people who will give descriptions will say he doesn’t exist. A weird duality, don’t you think? I think people are putting too fine line on what they think ‘existence’ is and isn’t. 

If you believe in Santa, whether you’re 8, 28, or 88, the only thing I can tell you is that I am jealous. I wish I still believed. I wish my world wasn’t filled with cold facts and mathematic equations. I wish there were still things that filled me with wonder whose explanation WAS the question. Santa exists, because he exists. And that’s all there is to it. You have something greater than anyone your age: the ability to believe in something that stands for simple goodness from your heart.

Keep that spirit alive for those of us who lost it, kiddo."

The dentist can be kinda scary, and everyone gets scared of going at some point. But ask anyone afterwards, and the worst thing that happens is the anticipation beforehand.

I would have been proud of you even if you didn’t get into Berkeley. Whether or not you’re proud of you has nothing to do with Berkeley. It has to do with you.

Did I ever tell you that I got accepted to Johns Hopkins? It’s true. I don’t talk about it much because I didn’t go. Everytime someone asks me I tell them something new. It’s always close to the truth, but it never is quite on the money. But I think you and I know the truth. I didn’t feel like I deserved it. And if I didn’t deserve it, how could it be that big a deal? 

Getting into Berkeley is a BIG DEAL, kiddo. Don’t short the sign of it. Professors whose whole job is to find the best of the best looked over thousands of applicants and decided that you were one of those best of the best. The question then becomes what you think of it. It’s been your goal to do something like this, and you were hoping to feel different. But that’s just it. You were always you, always capable. The you who could have done it just took the steps needed. You didn’t change when you got the letter, because you were you the whole time. Only now you don’t have that goal. 

That’s the thing about goals, kiddo. When you reach one, you gotta find another. 

It’s up to you whether you go or not. No one but you can make that choice. But Set yourself a new goal: you already made the big one. What’s the next thing you want to accomplish? You want to be a doctor? You want to be a professor? Run a library? Run for government? You can do all of it. But you won’t feel any more you than you, because it was YOU that did it. And you can do whatever you set your mind to. The letter from Berkeley only proves what I already knew all along

As for whether you’re proud or not? I can’t make you as proud as I am. But if you aren’t proud of this, let’s shoot for the moon together again. And when you do that, we will shoot for the sun, for Pluto, and for Andromeda. And I’ll be rooting for you every time.

Look, you sound young. And when we’re young we do stupid things for love. I’ve certainly done MUCH more embarrassing things.

Let me give you some advice on romantic gestures. When they work, son, they WORK. Your love interest will never forget them, and will be swept off their feet. However, for as impressive as they are, they work equally in the OPPOSITE direction. The same gesture that sweeps one lady off her feet is like eating fish heads for another. It’s all about perspective.

You shot your shot, son. And for that I’m proud of you. But in the future, if you get a no, it’s a no. If her boyfriend told you she wasn’t interested, let her come to you and tell you if that’s a lie, don’t go after her. There’s a reason dating is like fishing, and not like hunting. It requires patience, and for the fish to bite, not you to shoot. 

However, stand by your decision. If it had worked, how would it have felt? Amazing, right? You can be disappointed, but don’t be regretful. If anyone asks, tell them the truth: ‘I thought it would be romantic if it worked. It didn’t, oh well!’ The other young ones around you are only going to react to her reaction, not the intent, but you can. Don’t worry about what they say, and always do an action you’d want someone else to do to you.

Your actions does not a creep make, but in the future, wonder how the fish heads taste first. Okay, son?

I’m sorry your father never gave you a real childhood. There’s no handbook on how to be a dad. Yours really didn’t help. But it sounds like through all the hurt and hate that you really figured yourself out. All of your words are coming from a place of someone who knows where they stand.

And you didn’t need a father for that.

Your father can’t make back the time he wasted, and if he knows any better, he’s the one who should regret it more than anyone. It’s up to you whether you give him time now or not. There is no right answer. The hurt is going to be there regardless, the question is whether you think that he’s trying to make amends or dodge guilt.

The only thing I can really say as your internet dad, is that I’m proud of you. You didn’t need him to be you. You learned on your own what most dads have to tell their kids. And that’s nothing to scoff at. He’s the one who lost out, because you seem like a hell of a kid to have.

You teach your son to be a good person my showing him what that means. It means you have to be a good person. Not sometimes, but all the time. You have to surround yourself with people who love you for you, and who show your son that good always conquers evil

The more example he sees of you doing it, and of the people around you doing it, the more examples of being a good person he will have. Abusive partners are signs of abusive families. 

As for whether or not you keep attracting them, that’s a bit of a misnomer. You have to know in your heart what you’re worth, and be willing to give a good man a good shot. And you gotta take no shit from bad ones. If your next partner shows any sort of signs of abusive tendencies, kick em to the curb. You’re worth it, kiddo.

But you can’t control his father. Hopefully when he’s old enough, he’ll begin to understand that maybe dad isn’t the best person, but don’t take that opportunity to demonize his father either. Let him know that he has a choice: he is not his father or you. He’s his own person and must make his own choices.

Look, your bio father and mother are in denial. Bring trans hasn’t been accepted for very long (and for most STILL isn’t,) and your parent probably grew up hear horror stories of trans people committing atrocious crimes due to their confusion. They probably heard lies of sexual deviance, and somewhere along the lines tied it up to ‘trans people are bad people.’

After that, they learned to justify it. Any negative stories about a trans person was BECAUSE the person was trans, not just happening to be a trait of. Your parents probably never met anyone who was trans, and everyone they knew was good, right? It just further enforced the notion.

To change someone’s mind, it has to be done a little at a time. You, being their child, is not a little at a time but a blindside. Their first thought was probably that they did something wrong. But, instead it was easier to deny. The child they knew, the one they had visions of growing up a certain way, is gone. That child isn’t real. And you stand where their imaginative child stood.

In a sick way, they’re grieving. You can see it in their response. To me, it sounds like your bio dad is stuck in denial. It’s one of the hardest stages of grief to get past. 

Is that fair to you? Of course not. They don’t see how lucky they are to have a child intuitive enough to know who they are.

And so, perhaps your father would prefer to live in a land of imagination than to care for a child he helped create. If so, that’s not your dad. Anyone can make a child, but not everyone can be a father.

To answer your question, your father won’t respect your opinions because he refuses to believe you are who you are. And in that, he has shown you that he doesn’t want to love YOU, he wants to love who he imagines you being.

Perhaps one day your parents will realize that you have always been you, and are just now showing it. And maybe then they’ll realize that if they could love you then, they can love you now. And if they do, your relationship will be stronger than most.

But if they don’t, I’m here for you. I’m proud of you for showing who you really are, unafraid. Stand by yourself. No one knows you better than you. And I’ll stand by you too.

It’s perfectly okay to grieve, no matter why. You’re probably letting out the feelings of betrayal and hatred that have been burning up within you for years. Take all the time you need to grieve, even and especially when it feels nonsensical. You may find that the grieving process keeps coming up, again and again, and that’s okay. Each time will be a little better: like a good long cry. 

As for life advice, it’s only passing on the mistakes we’ve made in hopes that you won’t make them too. And you’ll make new mistakes which you’ll pass on to your kids.

But, you don’t need parents to learn mistakes from. But, if you want to hear the advice I’ve given and gotten, here’s 10 for you, from your internet dad

1) just because you don’t smell you doesn’t mean that she doesn’t. Smell nice, but don’t smell strong

2) never wear something on a date you wouldn’t wear anywhere else: being a fraud doesn’t make a good partner. That being said, dress up. 

3) work harder when your boss isn’t there. It doesn’t mean they aren’t watching

4) always arrive 5 minutes early. That way if the address is wrong you aren’t late

5) make your bed. It’ll teach you that the mundane mornings make for great evenings

6) everything is sold to you, even if you aren’t paying money, you’re paying time and you never get that back

7) should is a bad word: it shows you think there are people watching you. People don’t care enough

8) wear clothes that fit

9) own your mistakes, but don’t dwell on them

10) say please, thank you; and I love you. They are words you can’t overuse"

Love sucks. It hurts and it aches and it sucks and sucks until it doesn’t. But just because it hurts now doesn’t mean it will forever. 

Hurt is one of the greatest and most powerful emotions because it is a reflection of how much you care. The more hurt you feel, the more capacity you have to love. And someone who can love so very much WILL find love. It’s about when, not if.

And you may get trampled again and again. But remember every time you’re hurting that this is because you’re so full of love.

Sending hugs

Even if your birth parents don’t have faith in you, YOU have faith in you. Long after they are gone, you’ll still be here. And you know what, I have faith in you. You did better than I ever did in Uni, and for that, I’m thrilled.

You can do whatever you set your mind to with enough grit and determination (and a hair or two of luck). If you want to be a lawyer, be a damn lawyer! Your birth parents probably steered you away to save you from disappointment, without realizing that they were the ones disappointing. Disappointment is a part of life, and as long as you’re willing to take the punches, you should shoot any shot you want. 

Remember, family is who loves and supports you, not whose blood you share. Go for whatever dreams you have, but don’t let it kill you if it doesn’t work out. Dream Big, Plan realistic.

This is your brain trying to justify the urge to do the do, if you catch my drift.

Your body has gotten used to you whacking the weeds, and as such is juicing the fruit more. When you didn’t let loose, the pressure built up and your brain was trying to figure out why it would do that. As such, it showed you beautiful women because it thought ‘well hey, if I saw beautiful women, I would have some pressure built up in the pipes, right?’

Your brain is just doing what it can to make sense of your body. Don’t get worried. That being said, lay off the leaves. This is a good wake up call to show your body is getting to used to this. Try and wean away. By no means do I mean to neglect the little guy, but maybe not visit Pleasure Town every day, okay?

To me, it sounds like you’ve been an adult for a while. Age doesn’t equate to adulthood, no matter what the government will tell you. It really looks like your questions are more oriented around becoming independent, which is something everyone has to deal with eventually. 

Let’s start first with money, because that’s more concrete, and in my opinion a little more demanding to ‘solve’ right off the bat.

I doubt your birth parents are going to cut the cord the first day you turn 18. The looming threat is to try and put a fire under your ass and start getting you out there and self sufficient. I can see where they’re coming from, and I think you’re starting to see that too. You need motivation, and part of becoming independent is working even when no one gives it to you. 

Lots of jobs aren’t hiring immediately, but other jobs are coming in to replace those jobs that are changing to adapt in the current environment. You might have to get creative about work, and maybe have to do some jobs you don’t like at first. Telemarketers are still hiring, and haircuts are going to be in SERIOUS demand when this shit show is all over. Nows a good time to get in contact with those companies showing you’re interested (even if you’re not.) there are also hiring sites that will show some temporary work if you want to try something out. The jobs won’t be great, but they’ll give you some money, and that’s a good place to start. The important part is getting you some experience that doesn’t need schooling. 

As for your loneliness, there’s no way to make money without interacting with other humans. Just show them yourself, and you’ll make connections. As long as you aren’t openly antagonistic, the bonds of shitty work will forge faster than you think. Be open to new experiences, and you’ll find people in your life. Friendship over discord isn’t a bad thing, but it’s not human interaction: and you can see it doesn’t leave you with much after you sign off.

Some middle grounds could be to see if any tech companies need paid Mod positions. See if Discord or Skype are hiring for any positions, even if it’s moderating to see if there’s profane content. You won’t have to do the job long because of turnover rate; and your experience would be a plus in this situation. 

Let me know how it’s going. Well work through this one step at a time. 

-Dad"
internetparents,fnotih1,t3_g270ye,1587133297.0,"Hey internet Kiddo,

I was like this with my mother too. She’s a wonderful woman, but relied on me when I was young as assurance from someone she loved.

You’ve redefined your relationship from one of dependence to one of respect. The relationship can’t go back to what it was, and so as long as you’re okay with it, this is going to be what it is. If you’re not, let me know and we’ll work on talking your mom down.

But you’re realizing what all parents or pseudo-parents realize: no one has all the answers. Your sway on her opinions comes from a place of love and respect and understanding. As long as you know that the decisions she’s making are still hers, don’t feel bad being there to respect and reinforce the decisions she makes. That being said, you can’t decide FOR HER. Let her make the choice, and be there to support whatever the results are. She needs someone to be there to feel as though her choices are valid, and you can do that regardless of age. 

I understand the discomfort you feel with the responsibility, but as long as you are simply there as a support and not as a decision maker, it’s okay. In the end, she needs you for the same reason adult kids need adult parents: to be an emotional lifeline as a just-in-case. 

If you’ve done it well so far, you’ve already breeched the hard part. If you want, you can start backing off: slowly, but if you don’t that’s okay too. Just trust in yourself that she will make a decision no matter what: she just cares about what you think. 

Hope I could ease your mind

internetparents,fnosiom,t3_g32gpp,1587132735.0,"Hey kiddo, 

This is tricky. Broken homes are a symptom of underlying problems, they are not the problem themselves. Your mother and father both have issues, and it looks like you’ve been caught in the crossfire.

First and foremost, look after you. Do whatever is best for you to make sure you’re in the healthiest place you can be, temporarily or permanently as needed. Nothing can be done by you if you aren’t safe. 

Secondly, addressing your father, this isn’t your fight to fight. Don’t do anything reckless. However, that doesn’t mean don’t do anything. You can’t help whether your father is going to be affected by this or not. You can’t shield him and you can’t make him not feel what he’s going to feel. This is a time to be emotionally supportive of your father. Allow him to work through the pain your mother is causing him, and let him know you love him anyways. He’s a human: he’s a fallible man full of mistakes and regrets. If you want, let him know that those mistakes don’t define who he is, even if they’re a part of him. 

Thirdly, don’t make your mother out to be evil to your younger sibling. Let them come to this discovery on their own. Souring the relationship on your own could cause them to begin to resent you. If your mother is the way you say she is, your sibling will figure it out on their own eventually. You just need to be a crutch for them until that happens. Clean their wounds and give them a place to cry. But they won’t really get it until they GET IT, y’know?

To sum up, you’re in the crossfire of two adults who couldn’t coexist. The pain is deeper between these two than you could ever fix: so don’t try and fix or shield anything. Allow things to happen and be there to support the people you love. 

Hope I could help, kiddo.

internetparents,fnn7tcb,t3_g2qzqu,1587086295.0,"Hey kiddo

You aren’t stupid. It happens to everyone. Really.

My first accident was when I was 17. I was driving a rental: your grandfather had his car in the shop. The car was a beautiful silver: shiny and clean and new. And your grandfather, god knows what he was thinking, told me to hop in the front. 

I had my learner’s, too, but I hadn’t been on the road much. The only practice I had was with my mother’s old mini van, which drove like a boat. Cul-de-sac’s are easy when you’re only turning left... 

So when he told me to drive down the street to the beer store, my heart JUMPED. I was equally nervous and excited. Lo and behold, first turn out of the neighborhood the car in front of me stopped too quick. Instead of hitting the brakes, I floored it and nailed her. She... wasn’t so nice. You know what my father said to me? The same thing your lady said to you, and the same thing I’m saying now: ‘It happens to everyone.’ 

I was pretty scared to drive too. But you know what? It made me a better driver. I learned to always be prepared a step or two ahead, no matter what. I stay the speed limit, use my blinker, and watch the road. And you know what? 

A learner hit me 3 years later. Side swiped me after I had parked outside of work. 

All I could do was laugh! It happens to everyone.

So don’t worry about it, kiddo. Keep your eyes peeled, and let the kid who hits you off easy.

Now get behind the wheel and take a deep breath. You’ll be fine :)

Love ya, kiddo

Look, how you grew up isn’t who you are nowadays. It’s a lot like your shadow: always attached to you, and always following, even when you can’t see it. But that doesn’t mean it IS you. 

So maybe when you were growing up you weren’t the favourite. Maybe trying things wasn’t allowed, even if it was never said. But that’s your shadow talking, not you.  The shadow of your mother and I, the shadow of expectation, the shadow of shame. 

Today, though, you’re all grown up, and you gotta stop living in your own shadow. You can’t snip it off and make it go away, but that doesn’t mean you gotta be in it all the time. 

Here’s the truth, kiddo, you’re gonna suck at roller skating. And you know what, when you do is when I’ll be most proud of you. Because those bruises and scrapes you’re gonna get are going to be badges of honor, that you stepped out of your shadow and took on something new. And regardless of whether you get those bruises on your thighs skating, on your elbows surfing, or on your heart dating, for each one I’ll be there rooting you on. World isn’t nice, especially for us, but that doesn’t mean don’t try. 

Listen, I want to hear from you next week this time about your skating time. Tell me when you fell. Tell me when you got back up, and tell me how proud you were when you did. Cause I sure as hell am. It’s gonna suck at first, but you gotta persevere. It’s like eatin your veggies: it sucks until you’re past it.

Instead of worrying about the potential that holds too many variables, think of the paths as two roads. Each road will guide you to a city, and each city will lead you plenty. You cannot worry about what is in the other city you will never visit, but instead on making sure your steps lead you there. 

You choice must be the one that leads you the most inner peace in the time that you can control: now.

From what your post states, it looks like Cujo here has decided to place his trust in your husband. This is a common thing for dogs to do in a rejoining situation: to begin by picking one person to be their emotional rock. This person really sets the tone for the emotional tune that carries throughout the household. This is especially prevalent for the first 3-6 months that a dog is relearning a new home.

Dogs can come in 2 flavors when moving into a new home: the first kind of dog is on their best behavior, they cuddle with everyone and never cry. They’ll hold their business until their bladders explode and can even be timid about eating food. These dogs think that they’re guests in the home, and that it’s not really theirs. After settling in, these dogs can become destructive or loud as they realize that this is their home too. This isn’t a bad thing, but often something new pet parents aren’t prepared for! 
The second sounds a bit more like Cujo. These dogs don’t believe that this is permanent and so they don’t put any emotional investment in anything save for one person. Cujo is showing you his absolute worst right now because he has little interest in forming a bond with someone he doesn’t think is going to be there for him. It’s your job now to let Cujo know that you’re ready to be there for him. 

It sounds to me like you’re doing what you feel comfortable with in terms of bonding with Cujo. I think that’s great, and shows that you’re willing to try. However, since Cujo is the one who needs the cheering up, I think you really need to be the one willing to come to him. Start by calling his name. Say it in a sing song voice and get very excited when he responds. We want to get Cujo to realize that when you call him, it isn’t for punishment, but for love. Throw in some treats every once in a while too. While many people might think that this is spoiling too early, it really isn’t: we’re associating your voice to positive reinforcement. 

When we get to the point that Cujo seems calm around you, try some basic commands. ‘Sit’ and ‘Look at me’ are probably our two best because they’re really Intuitive for dogs, and can be performed quickly for fast rewards. Spend about 10 minutes a day working on those two, even after he seems to know it. We’re constantly trying to let Cujo know that when he does simple tasks, he’s making us happy and comfortable, and we’re showing him appreciation for it.

The final thing that you can do for Cujo is called ‘snapshot rewards.’ When Cujo does something that you like, like coming to sit next to you, being peaceful and relaxed, or wanting to play with you, we can reward him that way! Think of it like taking a picture of something you like and showing Cujo ‘this is what I like when you do it!’ These moment can be rewarded with treats, or with something else Cujo likes like a toy, or scratches, or even just a positive voice.

The last thing is to check your own emotional health around Cujo. If you’re stressed around him because you’re afraid he won’t like you, or might hurt you, he’s going to react to that. Cujo, being a pup and not a person, may not understand it is him that’s the problem, so he’s going to feel you be tense and think that the atmosphere around you is tense because you’re there. Try and relax around him. Include him in your day to day activities like walking, without focusing your whole energy on him. Be yourself, and Cujo will come out of his shell and love you too :)"

AskReddit,fic4zzy,t1_fiax2r5,1582337766.0,"Can’t believe I had to scroll this far down.

The music by Keichi Okabe is one of the best scores ever written, 

Jameson Price and Liam Obrien alongside Laura Fucking Bailey make for gorgeous voice acting of the main characters, 

And while a poor combat system, definitely one that tried its damndest to be cool and unique, like a dynasty warriors that cares about magic."

Doing something is not weakness, it is strength. This is your pivot point, OP. This is where your life can change for the better"
SuicideWatch,fia1x8x,t1_fi9ba2l,1582290731.0,I wish I could have everyone know how much work it is. There are no days off. It’s a daily fight with yourself to find things to live for. Menial chores that are difficult to do because all you want to do is crawl under a rock and sleep for eternity. It’s work.

SuicideWatch,fi86cnt,t1_fi83mrh,1582234284.0,"I would have. I didn’t care. Pills looked easier than anything else. I had guessed the same thing I’m guessing everyone else who doesn’t believe you and I, and all those who say it: you just didn’t take enough. 

I figured if I chugged enough the pain would be temporary, and then over. I took maybe 3 bottles? Then when my stomach felt ready to burst with the water, I started chewing more. I was just in the thought that if I took enough, it would be over. It wasn’t. I still woke up, and I also have an annihilated liver, chronic ulcers, no stomach lining to speak of, polyps up and down my intestines and a guilt that never goes away. 

Even after my family forgave me, years later, I still realize what it would have looked like if I hadn’t woke up. That’s what made me realize I needed to work for help. I’m hoping I can get one person here to realize help isn’t given, it’s clawed at. You have to want to get help; not passively but actively. You have to make choices to change. And it’s hard. It’s really fucking hard"

SuicideWatch,fi834ji,t3_f6vgg2,1582232551.0,"I tried to explain this on a post in this sub earlier talking about the romances of overdosing: and dancing until you die.

Thank you for being so articulate. There is no feeling like the death of your organs, slowly one by one. The only difference between you and I is that I planned. But I misjudged my bodies ability to reject the pills. Your body doesn’t want to die, and it will keep making you throw up or excrete or sweat to get everything out. No matter how much your mind wants to die, your body will shut your brain off and do what it can to keep existing. 

And the aftermath is horrible"
nier,fi3z265,t3_f4c5w1,1582130636.0,The only thing to remember from route A is that you aren’t supposed to know as much. Route B is supposed to fill in confusing details from Route A so that you get a more complete story leading into later endings
SuicideWatch,fhw8sz5,t3_f4wkn5,1581909258.0,"Yes, the writing that you said sounds beautiful.  But as someone who took a lot of pills, it’s not that simple. You’re awake and aware. You vomit, and expel. Your insides try and become your outside and it’s violently painful, and worse, it’s slow. You can’t keep the alcohol down long enough to get drunk, and you can’t breathe deep enough to get high. There is no romantic dancing, no time to write on the walls. It’s suffering, and when you wake up, you live with the pain you gave yourself forever. 

You can dream about it, but let it be a dream. Nothing in reality is ever as beautiful as dreams anyways."
SuicideWatch,fhp21jl,t3_f46mjt,1581780340.0,"You are the inspiration this sub needs.

For everyone who also thinks they want that noose, and for all of us who stay on this sub to tell everyone that life is worth it.

Seeing you post has made it all worth it, bro."
