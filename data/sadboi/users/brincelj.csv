BPD,fl7f3vf,t3_fn22ni,1584900437.0,"Sorry to hear your troubles. I don't have any advice, unfortunately. :(

But I can relate a lot. I was fired recently because there were performance issues related to my constant zoning out, due to mood swings. I'm not even looking for another job, because I am incapable of getting my shit together right now.

I am a silent borderline though, so I don't have outbursts. Well, at least not against other people. I'm banging my skull in fury instead, when I just can't bare all the self deprecating thought repeating endlessly. 

Anyway, just wanted to let you know, I understand you pretty much."
BPD,fl6i7ne,t3_fmx7c9,1584870054.0,"I was thinking of asking this question the other day!  Yeah, you're definitely not alone. I also had feelings of guilt when I started watching porn. Fast forward 20 years, and here I am, a self-loathing, disgusting bisexual pervert wondering ""Why me? Haven't I got enough issues?"" 

:'D"
BPD,fkj2hnk,t3_filcvx,1584234525.0,"I don't know if it helps, but I think that I completely understand your feelings and I am very sorry that there's nothing I can say to help.

I feel the same bitterness, envy and self loathing for the same reasons and this is indeed madness.

Sometimes (always, actually) I feel like I was a bird in a tiny cage, unable to move, let alone fly, while watching everyone else soar carelessly. Or like as if life gave me everything to be successful in the start, only to take away everything, one by one, through failures, mistakes, accidents and tragedies, only to show me where my real place in life is -- on the landfill.

I do urge you to not give up however. You deserve to be happy, no matter what you achieve or not. Shit, most people don't even care, ever. I truly know how hard it is to be kind to ones self, but you must try to give yourself a break. You are still young and can live a fulfilling life for decades if you can release the burden of wanting to prove your worth by pulling off some great feat."
BPD,fjm22l1,t3_fe49ip,1583459808.0,"I am 32 and have struggled with this all my life and have got myself into a range of unbelievably embarrasing situations (for which I loath myself to this day) and ""partnerships"" where I was being taken advantage of, big time.

I deliberately started learning how to say no in the last few years, as I was fed up. It's not easy, but it is, in fact, an aquirable skill.

So cheer up and just stop giving a fuck about how other people feel when you're not their personal 0-24 problem solver for the first time in their life. :D"
BPD,fjm0tbq,t3_fe5maj,1583458967.0,"I have no idea what to say, apart from, that I read your earlier posts and can understand your feelings and why you have done, what you did and really sorry for your hardships. Your environment might not understand...but who cares, honestly?

I know it doesn't mean much, but, as a fellow BPD person, I can only say: keep calm and try not to give a fuck. Or at least give less fucks. Other people really aren't worth as much, whoever they are, to make you kill yourself.

Give yourself some time to rest and then go and look for the kind of fun and life you want to live, that makes you happy, regardless of what anyone else thinks, however crazy that life may be. Just lose yourself in something, that sparks joy -- and is NOT self-destructive -- to forget all the shit for a while.

Theny you can sit down one day and think about how to really get yourself together. 

Dunno if I helped. But I'm honestly wishing the best for you now!"
BPD,fiwpmal,t3_f9zg5z,1582796884.0,"I feel this too. In fact, I explicitly asked my girlfriend to stop telling me she loves me, stop asking me if I love her, and stop making gestures of love. Problem ""solved"". :D"
BPD,fi8kd02,t3_f6z32j,1582242221.0,"You're not alone, I feel exactly the same way.

But that doesn't mean we're not both too far gone. :P :D"
