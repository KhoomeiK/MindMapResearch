Flex also allows you to specify flex properties (grow, shrink, basis) on the children, whereas with grid you need to define the columns / rows all at once on the parent. (The article above calls this content-out vs layout-in.)"

node,fc7m6sc,t1_fc7l5hr,1577512000.0,"Yeah, the details would get a bit tricky. I imagine there'd be lots of array operations (intersection, subset, difference, etc.) along with grouping.

E.g., to find recipes matching a user's profile, it may look something like:

    SELECT
      recipe_id
    FROM
      recipe_ingredients
    GROUP BY
      recipe_id
    HAVING
      -- Here <@ means ""is a subset of""
      -- user_profile_ingredients is an invented variable
      -- containing the IDs of the user's chosen ingredients
      ARRAY_AGG(ingredient_id) <@ user_profile_ingredients

Edit: not sure why formatting is weird :/"
node,fc7dmjv,t3_egkvf2,1577504323.0,"There are lots of ways you could approach this. The first step I would suggest is what you've already done: consider the set of use cases you want to support, and use them to inform your design.

If you want to look up recipes given an ingredient, then you should likely have some sort of index on the ingredient ID so that you can grab recipes from a given ingredient quickly.

One (one!) possible way to accomplish this would be to have three tables:
  - An ingredient table (has name, id, description)
  - A recipe table (has name, id, description, instructions, etc.)
  - A table to join the above two (each row has ingredient id, recipe id, and amount, for example)

Then, you can query all ingredients for a given recipe and all recipes for a given ingredient using the third table. This design doesn't address your later points though -- e.g. how to suggest recipes / ingredients."

css,fbzcu4v,t3_efas3v,1577242459.0,"You should be able to accomplish this using media queries, as you noted, along with `calc` and viewport units (`vw`). See [MDN's article on lengths](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/length) for more on `vw`.

For example, you can encode ""screen width - 200px"" as `calc(100vw - 200px)`.

I've only done a little C#, so forgive the potentially noob question:

Are there any concerns here about increases in runtime or memory usage? For each adjustment we perform, we're now storing an entirely new Enumerable object, and for large Enumerables, we may check these adjustment functions against a large number of entries.

(E.g., if I want to adjust 100 elements near the ""end"" of the Enumerable, then this will check each of those 100 adjustment filters against all the items leading up to the ones we want to change.)

I suppose if this is a concern you could update the replacement argument to be a function `(item, index) => replacement`, and then you'd only need a single layer in between."
