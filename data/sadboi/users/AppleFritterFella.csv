I want to do the RIGHT thing, even if I have to suffer for it and deal with the consequences.  So I keep my legs shut, stay out of risky situations and receive the benefits from it (no STDs, no baby-mama drama, etc).  YOU, on the other hand, seem to go with 'do whatever, no one cares'.  Which, popular as it might be, is a very bad way of living.  Overall, my life is healthy, hearty and full of good things.  No idea where you're at, but judging by your handle, Sinnuendo, you aren't terribly... restrained.  And will suffer the consequences of it.

Do I believe women should go through these tests?  Absolutely, since more than one person is at risk from their behavior.  Is it invasive?  Yes.  Uncomfortable?  Yes.  But making sure both you and your partner understand the consequences is more important than making you feel 'good'.  A woman's body isn't always just her own.
