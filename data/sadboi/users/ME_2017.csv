For a lot of people, the effects of weed and other drugs change as we grow. Whether it’s positively or negatively - you should definitely expect to see weed change for you other time. 

Weed, for the most part, has never negatively impacted my life. Yeah there were a few times when smoking all day everyday just had me stuck at home in a foggy depression, but I always snapped out of it quickly. But in recent years, it’s just been starting to make me uncomfortable. If I’m not careful about how much I smoke, then I can really put myself in a negative situation. If I get too stoned, then I get lost in my thoughts. I’ll sit there and overthink everything that has and is going on in my life and start to get very depressed and anxious. 

While I love weed and all the medical/social benefits it has to offer, after over a decade of daily smoking I’ve finally accepted that it’s come to a point in my life where I need to treat the plant with more respect. I need to enjoy weed for what it is in the right amounts, and not think it’s “cool” to smoke full blunts to the face and burn through grams a day. Couple puffs here and there is plenty to have me feeling good. Being stuck ina cycle of constantly having a high tolerance to the point you don’t get high anymore, then quitting, only to smoke my way back up to that point again is no fun. 

Sure weed is not heroin or crack but if you don’t take it seriously it can and will fuck up your mind. Be respective of your limits and your environments. Don’t smoke just for the sake of smoking because you wanna be high all the time. Understand that there is a time and a place for weed smoking. 

It’s a beautiful plant with lots of benefits and there’s a great culture of people who enjoy celebrating it every day. But my attitude has shifted from the way it was when I was 15 years old and pledged to smoke every single day for the rest of my life. I’m 26 now, and while I will probably smoke weed until the day I did, I will only do it at appropriate times and only consume appropriate amounts."

A week after he turned 18, he got arrested for it. Our state had mandatory minimums for selling in a school zone (this was right across the street from a school).

He snitched on anyone and everyone he ever knew that sold weed in our town and got all his charges dismissed. Growing up ina small town, him snitching on a few dealers was enough to scare everyone into stopping selling and nobody knew where to get weed for a while. 

His name was in the paper and a kid got pulled over and arrested with a shit ton of weed on his way to sell to him (after he got arrested). It was an obvious set up. He was a known snitch. He fled the state and moved a thousand miles away. 

Turning 18 is no joke. I’m sure this kid would’ve snitched regardless, but he was only one week into turning 18 and was facing serious consequences so he chose to do what he did."

It makes no sense that you feel you’re in the position to speak for small business owners especially when you’ve never worked at a restaurant lol.

And I get it, you hate the tipping system. And I can say “that’s what we do” because that IS what we do here in America. How many people do you know go out to eat and don’t leave a tip? Probably not many, if any. Sure, it’s no law, but it’s an unspoken rule here in the US. I don’t disagree that the system is flawed, but serving and bartending is NOT a minimum wage job, it’s usually a high paying one. When you’ve been doing something for years, you expect a certain tip percentage when you provide good service (15+%), so when people under tip we make comments about it. Also FYI, in some states the laws don’t require minimum wage, they require a tip wage. When I was working in NJ we made $2.14 an hour, but we’d get paid minimum wage if our tips failed to reach that amount (even though that never happens). You seem angry at the restaurant industry for some reason. Dude we didn’t create the tipping system, but it just is what it is, and I don’t see it changing any time soon. I ain’t complaining, I’m an engineer, I’m only serving in between jobs, and honestly my tips equal the same, if not more than I make to be a mechanical engineer.

The first guy I worked for straight up told me he only declared about 20% of his actual cash sales. Also nobody declares cash tips, at all, not a penny of them. A lot of bus boys and kitchen staff are paid under the table. And like I’ve said, I’ve seen owners take the cash from someone’s bill and just pocket the whole thing. The guy I’m working for now has the IRS coming after him. I’ve worked at 5 restaurants; and 3 of them were long term, trust me it’s true for all of them.

Also, as for your rant about tipping, we live in the US and we tip here. Until restaurants start to adjust their prices and start discouraging tipping, that will never change. Yeah, it’s shitty restaurant workers don’t get a paycheck so we make a big stink about getting shitty tips, but you would too if you rely on tips to keep food in your belly. 

And for what it’s worth I’m not some uneducated peasant that works in a restaurant. I’m just in between jobs right now. I worked throughout high school and college in the industry and it’s just a good fall back when I need quick income"
starterpacks,fgqlu6p,t1_fgqea5e,1581026669.0,"Yup. Hit the nail on the head. I started as a bus boy at 16 and worked my way up to eventually bartending and doing a little managing. I was so shy I could barely speak, and working there broke me out of my shell and really opened me up to the world. Defiantly changed the course of my life. 

I served and bartended throughout college and had an awesome friend group through all my coworkers. So many great memories (even though we were stoned and drunk half the time). Worked with so many crazy people from all walks of life. 

I’m currently in between jobs because I just moved, so I’m serving at two different restaurants. It’s not ideal, and I certainly can’t wait to be back on the 8-5 grind, but I’m secretly loving the shit out of this right now. Feel like I’m in college again."

starterpacks,fgqj0ib,t1_fgqhg5e,1581025123.0,"Yeah but how much time do you spend with these restaurant owners? Are you there during normal business hours? It seems to be true anywhere I’ve gone.

Most restaurant employees in general smoke cigs, and smoke a lot because it’s a high intensity job and smoking is the only real excuse you have to take a break. 

A lot of owners are alcoholics because of the stress and the fact that they have an open bar and can make whatever drink they choose at any given time. And just being in that environment exposes you to a lot of drunks. 

The Red Bull thing is generally universally true because it’s impossible to work 7 days a week for long hours and not need some caffeine boost to stay afloat. 

The weed is definitely not true for every restaurant owner, but it seems to be true for every owner and employee I’ve ever worked with. 

Tax evasion comes from the fact that a lot of business owners (this is not limited to restaurants) tend to under declare on cash sales. Not declaring cash tips is also very common. And paying employees under the table as well. I’ve seen many times where we were about to close, and the owner does the sales reports, and then just takes whatever cash he gets after that and pockets it. 

As for the charging thing, it’s very common for restaurant owners to nickel and dime, even ridiculous things like a cup of dressing that couldn’t possibly cost more than a few cents. 

The alternating between being cool and being a dick usually is consistent with them being slow or busy, because when they’re busy and people mess up orders and/or customers get impatient, it brings out their true personality when they have to handle these situations. The industry in general just seems to turn people into dicks."

starterpacks,fgqe81w,t1_fgq7beh,1581022479.0,"Oh I have a good story. The second restaurant I worked at was owned by easily the biggest pieces of shit on planet earth. We had to pool tips, which is bullshit but that’s a story for a different day. 

So somebody the owner had a business relationship with (accountant I think) came in and got drinks and food at the bar. She comped their entire check. Knowing their bill was comped, they left $60 in cash which was clearly a tip for us. The girl who was bartending later told me that the owner said to her “oh I think they left the $60 for the food”. And when she argued her on it, she decided to only take half.

Still pisses me off to this day, especially the fact that she had the audacity to take the whole thing."
starterpacks,fgqcyer,t1_fgq9pb4,1581021909.0,"Yeah I hate when they’re dicks. I know it’s not right, but there were plenty of times where I just gave them the side of dressing and didn’t charge. 

It also sucks when they won’t do anything about people having horrible experiences. I’ve had that many times before, where the kitchen or server blatantly fucks up, and the owner won’t even comp a drink or offer a desert. 

Like you said, we understand we gotta make money. But in the long run you’re losing a potential long term customer over what? A $5 beer?"

But if I’m in the wrong setting or smoke a little too much, I lose my shit. My anxiety will increase ten fold and I’ll get super depressed as i sit there and reflect on my shitty life. Sucks because in my teens and early 20s weed was always a good time.

As far as hunger, when I’m not smoking I instantly lose weight. If I get stoned I’m eating everything in my house and that’s a promise. My new problem is this fucking abilify that makes me eat nonstop. 

As for the dope, you need to stop that shit man. I’ve been there before. Being a chipper is almost more dangerous than being an addict. Your tolerance is low, you’re very likely to OD. What if you get fentanyl? Can you get oxy’s (assuming they’re real)? Stay the fuck away from dope dude! It’s a death sentence."

I’m not a full blown schizophrenic, I’m just incredibly bipolar and erratic, and I’m pretty sure I have ADHD.

As for side effects, I definitely have them. When I bumped up my dose last week I felt horrible the first few days. Now I don’t feel a thing. 

As of now I don’t plan to stop taking them for at least 2 years. The thing I can’t seem to understand is how I or the doctor would know when I’m ready to jump off? If I’ve been on them for a certain amount of time, how would they know if I’ll be stabile or not. Seems risky, but who knows."
