Had headgear. It kept popping off in my sleep and cutting the corners of my mouth. I’m a kid. I play with germs 98% of the day. I clean my hands when I gotta. Whatever. 

I’m in choir one afternoon. Start getting a bad headache right in between my eyes and my forehead. I rub it so much you can see a visible red T. I go home, mom gives me kid tylenol, and I guess I went to sleep early on the couch. 

I wake up with a sore neck and that headache is worse. Maybe I slept funny on the couch she says. My forehead is looking a bit more red. My little brother has a checkup scheduled that day so my mom figures she’ll bring me too. 

He takes a look at me. Takes my temp. Tells her to drop my brother off with someone and take me directly to emerg. Don’t panic - he’ll meet her there in an hour. At this time, my headache is so bad I want to die. I distinctly can remember that pain. My forehead is beginning to swell at this point. 

We get to emerg. They’re having drs flown in from Sick Kids. They’re having specialists from all over. They ruled out meningitis. They don’t know what this is. 

By this time, its like 6PM. They’re admitting me. I’m being set up with an IV and I’m terrified. My dad comes to see me. He doesn’t let on how bad it looks - but my Nana does the next morning. She comes in to see me and walks out saying “sorry must be the wrong room”. I tell her no, it’s me. She gasps.  

I look in the mirror in the bathroom across the hall. My little personal one only had a toilet and sink. I look like Worf from Star Trek. My face and forehead have swollen so much and the veins and muscles are bulging out. My eyes were squished in underneath a giant forehead. 

Turns out, I had cellulitis. The headgear caused it. I got saliva/germs in the cuts and it infected my head. If my mom waited another day it would have crushed my brain from pressure and swelling and was passing down my neck towards my heart. I spent a wk on IV antibiotics in the hospital and it was honestly kinda fun there haha. But yep. There was that time. 

There’s also been a few suicide attempts but we don’t talk about those."
AskReddit,fopgy2k,t3_g88ccd,1587961215.0,"So.  

My mom and sister were gone somewhere. 

My dad had forced me (his teenage daughter who hated outside labour and heights) and my younger brother to help reshingle the roof. 

They left to get some more supplies & I stayed home, to naturally talk to my friends via dial up. 

Cell phones were still newish in the way that - very few of my friends had them. I’d gotten a pay-as-you-go peanut phone for Christmas. You know the ones. 

My cell phone rang. Odd because that rarely happened back in the day - minutes cost money still. Most friends opted for text that did have phones. Cell phones didn’t have caller ID for everyone back in the day - only if you paid for it & a whole whack of other things. 

The conversation went something along the lines of - what was I doing? It sounded like an older, sort of mildly british man, with a very deep voice. 

I told them I was helping my dad reshingle the roof. They responded with, no you’re not, I just saw them leave, I know you’re home alone. 

I immediately hung up and used our house phone to call my mom who said it was probably my dad fucking with me. I called my dad who swore up and down it wasn’t him. 

They called again - I answered again. They wanted to know if I was scared and what I was really doing and if they should come over. I asked who they were. They said they’d see me soon. 

FULL PANIC MODE. I called my mom back, she didn’t answer. I call my dad, nothing. I freak the hell out and grab my dog, lock every door and window, set the alarm to home & hide in my bedroom with him thinking okay - this is it. I’m gonna die. I then called the phone company and changed my phone number for my cell. 

No one came (as far as I know I stopped watching the driveway and our driveway was VERY long and tree covered, we lived on a 10 acre farm with lots of forest) and no one called our house phone (which was widely known by my circle at that time) & no one contacted my new number. My parents came home and I just remember being terrified for a week after that, that someone was waiting down our driveway for me. 

Never know who it was and no friend ever fessed up either."

I was bullied. A lot. So much so the police came to my house shortly after columbine happened. 

I didn’t have access to weapons & I had zero plans to kill anyone. 

But the bullying on me & my breakdowns in school were enough to merit that by my principal. 

I dyed my hair black. I only wore black. I bought black eye liner. I switched to metal and rock music. I wanted to make everyone terrified of me, as terrified as they made me feel.  

The police came again & I was transferred schools. New school was amazing. I made friends. It was amazing. But I never forget those fucking years of torture. 

I contemplated suicide a dozen times. Attempted half that. Be lying if I said this song wasn’t playing a few times. 

My brother committed suicide in 07. In front of our same shared HS. I’d graduated.  That place is what fucking nightmares are made of. I have 2 other siblings who barely made it out (one graduated, one didn’t). This is a small Canadian city and I think it breeds curses. More than just our family affected anyways.

I was called a “master masker” by a colleague (higher up than I, he is a psychologist, anyways) as no one detects depression in me. 

I suffer from it horribly. So much that I think its “all in my head and I’m making up depression myself” ... it’s bad. 

I go to work. I function **SO** insanely well there. Outside of work? Zero to minimal function happening. If anyone paid attention - they’d notice I never eat while there. How many days I wear the same clothes. Don’t shower... but no one does I guess and if they do they don’t comment because my work is outstanding.  No one calls me out for crying when I walk out of a bathroom, its simply “unspoken & understood”. When I come in “tired” looking... I haven’t slept in days, albeit I tried. I come home and dread long weekends w/o something to “do” (ie fuckin’ work)


Right now I’m on a MH leave from work... otherwise I would have been fired because I could *feel* myself going so intensely downhill. My job gives me self-worth. Being off is better for me but it feels terrible. 

I’m great at staying social. Pretending to interact as I imagine it. Cause for the most part I dunno where I am while doing that... at least I know I’m faking it all. I don’t lie to myself.

I shower. I eat (one meal a day). But I can’t make myself do much more. Then I feel “proud” for my *accomplishments*."
