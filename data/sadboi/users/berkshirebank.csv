iamagarbageperson,fq8cn5p,t1_fq6y3oc,1589163187.0,"The context in which this is being discussed involves adults and the way in which you expressed your point seemed as though you were a proponent of later in life violence to facilitate some kind of citizen mandated justice, it’s impossible to target the children of racist parents which is generally who will be rearing these kids but that would result in more hatred I think, The solution (I think broadly) lies in exposure to those minority groups and thorough interaction to form an educated opinion (which if the individual is open minded and patient will result in recognition of commonality) it just seems like too simple of a solution for a complex issue involving generationally metastasized prejudice. I don’t mean to be invalidating I was just curious on my end and don’t really understand the format of implementation for your suggestion. I just think hurting people is a bad way of enforcing healthy lasting change.  Thanks for taking the time to reply. Who knows there’s probably a lot that can be reconfigured or highlighted in regards to hate crime laws. I think being reprimanded by a third party usually discourages poor behavior than two groups settling it themselves? But I’m not qualified to discuss laws just a thought"
iamagarbageperson,fq5ewsv,t1_fpqrovi,1589102758.0,"There are too many variables involved to attribute  a high success rate occurring with just a simple implementation of psychological conditioning. I think if racists were being killed or injured on a larger scale, mass retaliation would occur (racists would find validation or justification to harm others through defending themselves lethally) and it would be a cyclical mess of a race war and reintroduction of prejudice and racism."

Although I do think this concern is healthy and should be addressed, if you have a teacher you trust, you should have a conversation with them about it, clear the air and express your difficulties and maybe brainstorm options to assist you in thriving or redirecting, sometimes your approach is faulty but sometimes a change of scenery is necessary not that I’m directly implying anything to this specific situation, because I don’t actually know you, but please try to speak with someone who can help directly within the school system! :^> <3 I hope things work out"

SuicideWatch,fmjm7fv,t1_fma9iuv,1586133135.0,"It seems suitable to make someone aware of the existence of something that may be helpful, of course there’s a stipulation of research and the implication that professional intervention is always necessary anyway, it isn’t something attainable otherwise, it feels similar to recommending someone look into meds in a general sense which of course implicitly accompanies the suggestion to see a psychological professional, apologies if I’m proliferating bad information. But maybe my suggestion was a bit relaxed."
writers,fmewycr,t1_fmdzgqw,1586015322.0,It’s been removed from its context. I was emotionally focused on this. But my grandma is in bad shape and her toes are necrotic from infection and I never claimed to feel attached to the human body but seeing and hearing of her apathetic behavior is upsetting. I hope when she’s dead she’s just given the right of careful preservation which obviously while living she isn’t being granted. I guess it’s gross because it’s hardly intrinsically  pleasant. it’s pretty clear how I feel but I’m unsure how the reader will be affected by it but I assume it will align similarly with my feelings it’s a commonly grim experience. The mechanical comment I’m having difficulty commenting on is it necessarily an issue? Thank you for the response

When you’re such a state that makes you unreceptive towards most other treatments ECT is recommended, and hey if you’re intent on dying any possible side effects really aren’t of concern especially because they’re minor in comparison to suicidality."
