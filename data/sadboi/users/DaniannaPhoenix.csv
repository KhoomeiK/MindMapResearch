As far as the “clout” complaint goes... that all these people “don’t care they just want clout!”

I this a better question/observation is:

“Why does Onision generate so much clout for those youtubers who are looking for clout?” (Which realistically is all youtubers... some just want a different type of content/clout than others)

But, Onision generate clout because of his actions regarding very young women, and teenage girls. 

He generates clout because he has intentionally angered and upset people for “clout.” 

He spent many years on the speaks channel being “preachy”. Acting as if he was the moral arbiter of all things, and now people are calling out his lack of morals when it comes to many things, but particularly young girls... a demographic he intentionally and deliberately targets, engages with, and dates.

While I’m glad he’s trying to be more “vocal” about the 18 plus stuff... it feels like there have been no real changes in HIM.

Next thing... in my prediction of this ridiculous saga that really shouldn’t exist...

They’ll be another teenager in his life... dating wise... someone who “breaks the mold for him.” He “said a million times he HATES teenage girls” (despite all the history... ) but this one breaks the mold! That’s just how I see things unfolding in the future.

I did the same thing. I used to be socially involved, volunteered, worked, and had hobbies. Now just working 40 hours a week wipes me out socially and mentally and emotionally.

I pictured myself being a different person by 30. Yeah I’ve heard people tell me the same thing... I’m more quiet “more broody” and more frantic than before. Less focus. Less drive. Less ability to concentrate. Too worried to hang out with.

But it’s not the end of the world. I’m still who I was, with added experiences, and new coping mechanisms. Some that I hope to shed when I’m ready to. Some that I won’t.

It just wasn’t as painful for me when I stopped mourning for the person I thought I would become that doesn’t exist. But there’s still a mourning process, and I’m sorry for that.

Idk. The people worth having in your life will stay. Even if the relationship with them changes, the people not worth having will go."
narcissisticparents,fl61vkh,t1_fl31a4t,1584851840.0,"I do the same thing. But I catch myself and feel horrible. My mother and brother are almost... incapable of the self awareness of seeing this.

I also have a problem of tuning people out when they talk because while being homeschooled... my mother would talk to me about her martial problems after screaming at me for making a mess. I just learned to tune out after a certain amount of time, same with my ex husband who used to say shit like “if people knew you like I knew you.. they’d know why you’re bruised up!!”

So yeah sometimes I can be controlling in conversations, or just get excited and say shit. It’s a fear of the conversation going someplace that’s going to fuck me up all day... or just stupid ADD lol"

narcissisticparents,fl2m8sd,t3_flx6g4,1584754384.0,"This is the WORST realization.

My N mom homeschooled me. So a lot of my socialization abilities come from her. Talk and don’t listen, just wait for your turn to talk and say whatever you’re thinking about vs. anything in relation to what the other person said...

I have to watch myself and try and not do this. But it’s difficult once you’ve passed the age your brain developed the social norm part of it. Yes!! We can all adapt!! But it takes time and practice and hope that other people will have patience and believe that you mean well.

I would highly recommend getting a therapist. Even if they are hard to find during the covid 19 pandemic. Maybe an online one would work?"
narcissisticparents,fl2m39r,t3_fm63iq,1584754277.0,"You’re already steps ahead.

I moved out when I was 18, back in at 21 and out against at 22.

My brother told me, “since you’ve been gone, moms been really difficult to deal with. She’s been taking all her anger out on US instead!”

I remember trying over and over to get my brother to see how fucked that statement was. And how a lifetime of being her only “anger outlet”, especially while homeschooled would fuck a person up. He didn’t get it. He is now 28, and hadn’t been capable of holding a full time job over a year due to his own NPD issues

Don’t be hard on yourself. Scapegoats are like the tortoise. They get off to a slower start than a lot of their golden child counter parts. But as life goes on, that strength you developed from being your families punching back, separating from them, and moving on gives you a strength other people won’t understand. It will make you strong, and you’ll be okay."

HomeschoolRecovery,fkyp2a2,t1_fkwmyu0,1584653197.0,"I agree with the cult comment. A full reply on how much I agree would be too long of a comment lol.

The only situations I saw where homeschooling seemed okay was when kids were bullied mercilessly, and there wasn’t another school to go to... and one other time I knew of a kid with dyslexia. 

He couldn’t be in the regular class because he slowed them down, and the retarded kid class held him back. He was NOT retarded or even stupid... very smart guy. Just letters didn’t line up right for whatever reason when he saw them. 

The special ed teachers were so preoccupied making sure these other kids didn’t bite each other, shit their pants, piss in the room.... they didn’t have much time to help this kid reach his full potential. 

So that’s why I’ll alway say... there may be like a handful of times homeschooling isn’t so awful... I just feel like 95% of the time, it’s cultish, controlling, mentally ill mother’s who fail to report abuse due to the “us”vs. “then mentality” at least that’s how it was in the late 80s in the south when I was homeschooled.

Sorry for the long comment"
HomeschoolRecovery,fkynjej,t1_fkx4gjn,1584652299.0,"There are a lot of states where that is not the case.

And I’m open to the idea that maybe things have changed since the early 90s/late 80s or homeschooling. But, back then it felt that way. “Us” vs “them”, mostly religiously motivated, or paranoia motivated parents.

I seldom saw or met any people who homeschooled due to their child’s learning disability or Autism. In fact, the one family I knew with five kids homeschooled all of them... and once the mother had an autistic child she sent him to school because he was “difficult.”

It’s hard for me to picture homeschooling as anything other than a parent being controlling."
HomeschoolRecovery,fkwff1o,t1_fktiki0,1584590964.0,"I could have worded it better. I just feel like homeschoolers have this “not turning on their own” mentality, even when there may be a family in the homeschooling community that is clearly abusive."
