Many of the stories say cruise bookings for 2021 are up 40% — a figure that seems almost incredible given what is going on.

It is, in fact, incredible.

The 40% figure, which came from CruiseCompete.com, an online cruise marketplace, was misinterpreted, according to the company’s top executive.

Bob Levinstein, the CEO of CruiseCompete, told The Points Guy the 40% figure referred to a change in the type of bookings the company was receiving. The company was trying to say it was seeing more far-off cruises being booked versus close-in cruises.

It turns out bookings for 2021 aren’t up by double digits at CruiseCompete.com: They’re down by double digits.

“Looking at everything on the books for next year, we are down about 23%,” Levinstein said.




https://thepointsguy.com/news/cruise-bookings-strong-despite-coronavirus/

What cruise bookings there are, are people on all the cancelled 2020 cruises who were given up to a 40% bonus to rebook instead of refund, and the cruises they are booking are substantially cheaper. Not good for revenue when things do reopen.  The cruise ships that do go out will be under capacity and tickets sold below cost, if they are even allowed to go at all. 

You’d have to be an idiot to book a cruise knowing 70% of the ship can get infected from one case of covid, and it might be weeks of quarantine in a 8x8 room before you find a port willing to let you debark. But there are idiots in the world!"

EVO in Scottsdale switched from selling entrees to repackaging wholesale restaurant supply foods into consumer-sized packages and built an online grocery store overnight with curbside delivery.  They were the only place that could get you white flour in a city of 5M people.  Still might be.

No reason Sweet Tomatoes couldn't have built an online custom-salad ordering system and deliver curbside, drivethru, or pay servers to drive it to your house like a pizza place.  They just lack imagination."

Quality wood species - good. Oak, hickory.  

Plastic in any format - bad bad bad. Plastic plank floors, plastic countertops.  Shit they don’t even make the good credit cards or shopping bags out of plastic now. 

Real stone - good. Quartz is also in, which is stone ground up and reformed using epoxy. 

Metal doors, solid doors.  Windows with high R value."

To me it looks like shipping damage. 2x4s are delivered on a pallet and lifted by a fork truck. It looks like the fork lift tines were too low and when they drove toward the pallet to pick it up, the tines hit and blew out that section of 2x4 because it was on the outside. 

That needs to be cleaned up so it doesn’t make drywall bulge but otherwise it’s fine, if a little sloppy."

GoRVing,fps6qx7,t1_fpri5dw,1588868401.0,"Here’s just the (red map) Tesla branded superchargers in the US. That’s the ideal ones to stop at for me, admittedly limited to major roads. It’s not like a car where you just drive and hope you bump into one - the Tesla knows where all the stations are, how many people are using them, how many minutes you should charge at this one to make it to the next, etc. and it’s constantly recalculating optimal charge patterns for your trip. Feels like a spaceship.

The car wants you to stop at a given supercharger for usually 10-20 min. If you charge longer there, it will then recalculate your later stops to be shorter. Best case I can do 7 hours of highway driving with a 20 min charge at about mile 290, not towing. Of course I “only” have a 310 mile range Tesla. 400 mile range ones went up for sale this year. 500 mile range come out next year, and 600 mile range Tesla’s are on the roadmap for 2022. 

Other (green map) is all the nontesla chargers between Dayton and Cincinnati (purposely picked a not particularly charger friendly area).
