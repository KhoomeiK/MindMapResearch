Mental illness is more like a spectrum, it spans from mild to severe, and it changes you accordingly. 

Personally, I started to suspect myself having mental issues not until I had a breakdown at work, and generally unwillingly to participate any kind of social activity later on. I also suffers from self doubt and the feeling of worthlessness. 

One thing that kept me going is that I exercise a lot, just to feel I’m not stuck and stop growing as a human being, to start building my self worth again. Maybe you can get out of that sinkhole by doing something you can see progress physically. It’ll get better if you let yourself.

horror,fln07sm,t3_fn4wdd,1585304091.0,"Unpopular opinion: this movie is overrated. 
At first glance, this movie’s premise is so enticing and quite fascinating. It certainly has potential. However, in the movie, there is too many problems.  For example, who is the girl; do they really had enough food for all floors? The notion of the ignorant mass? Why one the second day, they left F/2, then the lower floor is already killing each other? Why did the protagonist ration food each floor yet there’s still not enough for the lower floor? 

Don’t get me wrong, I love pro-modernism as much as the next guy, but this movie is too problematic for its symbolism to shine through. Whether it’s sloppy or a open-ended master piece, it surely lays within the detail. And this movie is disappointing."
