So, really, what's the point of working hard? In the end, something bad will happen. Probably economical since I'm 24, and healthy. I probably lose my home and my belongings will be taken and I probably live on the streets. My family is in a similar situation. Why should I continue with my life anyway?

No subsidy or anything towards local business owners, which makes my family's situation worse. They have to go to work everyday and have to pay taxes and stuff.

I can't advice them anything anymore because they're slowly panicking over being at home 'forever'. They feel like it's not going to end. I can't help them anymore. I told them to be asking advice from here but they're not doing it, which makes me feel worthless amid this panic over virus.
