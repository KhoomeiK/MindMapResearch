beauty,fqtlmuo,t3_gkvxbj,1589641398.0,I used to work in swimwear for years. If you want a lot of support you can get a bra style top. Some brands make up to an F so you can defiantly find your size. The two brands that stick out as having good underwire supportive tops for large cups are Tommy Bahama which ties around the neck and back with an underwire cup or there’s Becca which will have over the shoulder straps more like a bra. La Blanca has a good bra top too but it runs in dress sizes but still can accommodate someone who is busty. Hope this helps! I know how hard it is to find tops when you are top heavy and need support.
