AskReddit,fqwrxxw,t1_fqups3b,1589715609.0,"that one im not so sure about. i would want it to be humane like i said. if the ailment is so awful, should they stay alive? but ""awfullness"" is very subjective. you stumped me there! do you have any ideas?"
AskReddit,fqupm2w,t1_fqumw1n,1589662640.0,"there would be a legal contract to protect everyone involved, included the child. so if the mother is looking for a family with an agency then she has to sign and agree not to back out at the last moment. it's understood that holding the baby could really change your mind, but that expecting family has waited for the baby so it's rightfully theirs. if they both decide that the mom should keep the kid after it's born, then they can mutually void the contract.
if the mother doesnt want to choose a family herself, then the agency just goes to the top of the list and asks if they would want the child. if not, they keep going down the list until somebody wants the baby. and when a family says yes, they sign a contract saying that they wont back out at the last minute. and last minute would be within like two or three months of the due date, unless for some emergency that would need to be determined as reasonable in a court.
if the family decides they dont want the child for whatever reason? i thought of two things. one, the mom can choose to raise the child until a family decides to adopt the baby, putting her baby at the top of a list to be adopted. she'll also receive money to care for it. or two, the baby will stay in the hospital while an agency alerts the families at the top of the list that a newborn baby is up for grabs.
and this is all one by one by the way. not like ten families are alerted and they have to be the first. the only time it isnt one by one is when the mom chooses to look at families. then i think she should be given the top five families profiles to check out."
AskReddit,fqumrbm,t1_fquluud,1589661385.0,"ah okay cool.

i would say that the children ""dont count"" seeing as they arent there. so with a stillbirth, the family is allowed to try again. if the baby was being given up for adoption, the family who was meant to receive the child would go towards the top of the waiting list or like in a top priority kinda thing. and if they die later on, it's fair to have another. they arent alive to use up resources so someone else could take their place."
AskReddit,fqulayw,t1_fqujl3u,1589660740.0,"well if i use this world as a sort of model, there are however many women who cant have kids at all or try and cant carry to term, etc. and so most of those women and their spouse if they have one will go to an adoption agency and be put on this looong waiting list to receive a surrogate.
most humans love sex because it's an instinct. so even with free birth control, theres bound to be slip ups or people who just choose not to use it. so each pregnant woman who doesnt want to keep her child would be paired with a person or couple as soon as they reach their second trimester(i dont know how much you know about pregnancy but women are told not to mention theyre pregnant until the first trimester is passed/after three months because thats when youre more likely to lose the baby for whatever reason)or the pregnant woman can get a list and pick a nice family. it would have to be people at the top of the waiting list though because, of course, it's a list and it should be fair in the order that people are picked.
i guess im more hoping that we wouldnt somehow run out of people who want kids and cant have them or want to adopt an extra. it's a possibility but small i would think. and there are always celebrities or wealthy people who just have the funds and would want more children. but again, thats being hopeful and that isn't something i would really use if this were a reality to ensure that each unwanted child is adopted.
babies and young children are more likely to be adopted than older children and teens so why not get them from womb to family as soon as possible? 
did i answer the question or did i ramble?"
AskReddit,fqujzz1,t3_gl10gq,1589660159.0,"maybe less testing. i feel like some teachers teach to the test so we only learn what we need to for a test, then move on to the next text and learn for that one. and some teachers do try to remind you of things or incorporate things learned previoisly but yknow. why the hell would i remember one thing i learned first quarter when it's third quarter (easily the hardest quarter) and i have 5 or 6 other classes?
and i feel like we should have more homework for relevant classes. of course i mean core classes and less for electives. practice is so important. i had a geometry class in high school i basically never had homework for, so it was fine because i had free time but i wished i had more of the structured practice so it wouldnt slip my mind as easily until next class. i had over 10 problems for homework every day in algebra two/trig and precalc and it helped A LOT for tests and quizzes. a class here is 90 minutes but you also have that class every other day so you can imagine how easy it is to forget everything."
AskReddit,fquip39,t3_gl10zx,1589659582.0,"when i was in sociology as a junior in high school, i came up with a two child policy for an assignment where we had to pick a problem in the world and come up with a solution. it's essentially like the one child policy in china but less inhumane and more reasonable in my opinion.
married couples get two children. single individuals get one. if you find out youre expecting and are already at your limit, you can have the child and pay i think $2000 or $5000 per month to the government to keep it. the money goes towards keeping healthcare free for everyone in the country. if you dont want to pay the money, you can put your child up for adoption and be guaranteed that they'll be adopted before even giving birth. the mother can pick the family or leave it up to adoption agencies. this is basically like surrogacy or literally finding a couple to give your baby to in our world now. the foster system doesn't exist in this world. or you can have an abortion for free. everyone is also offered every form of birth control for free. 
i didnt work out the super specifics like if you have a child and hide them or if the thousands of dollars is enough to keep healthcare free or if it's too much or if it's illegal to marry someone to keep a child like how it's illegal to marry someone for a green card. i just said no killing kids. it was just a project and i was actually really proud of it because i did a lot of research about china and how it worked pretty well for them. 
we had to make a website and i made a petition on that one website thats big for signing electronic petitions and everything. i kind of wish we presented them because it's super controversial but i think it's a topic everyone could have an opinion on. do you really need 13 kids? i get wanting to see the outcome between you and your spouse but why do you need more than maybe two of your own when there are i dont even know how many kids in the foster system? i dont even see why the system exists when there are so many people and families and couples who would kill to have a child but cant. why not pair each kid who's given up for adoption with someone who's on that adoption list right away? abortion is another thing but i think it should still be a thing just because there are so many reasons and cases to get one.
i dunno. just somethin to think about."
