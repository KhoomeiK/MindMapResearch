Switching to metric units for everyday measurements would cause unnecessary confusion and could even pose safety concerns in the early stages of the transition (e.g., think of automobile drivers not be used to their speedometers showing kilometers per hour instead of mph). Plus we’re Americans. The world doesn’t dictate to us. We are free to use whatever system we want. Why not stand out?"

I set like 5 alarms every morning and getting up is a 2 hour process if I get up at all. I even have a “sonic bomb” alarm which is extremely loud and even has an extension to a vibrator that shakes your entire mattress. I don’t even wake up to that half the time. Or I wake up, turn it of while my mind is still essentially asleep, and go back to bed without realizing what I’ve done. I was fired from my last job due to this (even though I had disability accommodations in place — lost my job but I got a nice settlement because the company didnt want to be sued after I had my attorney send a demand letter. Still, I’d much rather have the job back)."
leaves,ezxof0c,t1_ezxkhrs,1568245531.0,"I’ve been looking for a good app to use too to help with quitting. So far I haven’t found anything good in the App Store. I tried Grounded: Quit Weed but it doesn’t really apply to me because you use the app to track how many grams you smoke per day so you can see how much money you save by not smoking that amount. However, I vape so I don’t really have any inputs to use. I think the “Quitting Weed” app is not for iOS because I can’t find it on the App Store. 

Does anyone use an app for iOS that is made especially for quitting an addiction or that has been helpful during the quitting process?"

So I haven’t smoked at all today and now I don’t even have the option (which is good). But I find that instead of having more energy and focus I just have no interest in doing anything and I can’t concentrate or pick a single task to do. And once again I got zero studying done. 

Also, what is a little unpleasant is that I am having suicidal ideations. Please, please don’t jump to interpret this to mean I am suicidal or want to harm myself. It’s more along the lines of just thinking life has no purpose, what is the point, and would it matter/would I be missed if I was gone/didn’t exist?

This is gonna be a rough withdrawal. Another fear I have is alcohol. Usually I hardly drink at all, even socially. But in the past, when trying to quit, I have replaced weed with alcohol. In the summer of 2016  when trying to quit I was at a point where I was taking 10 or more shots over the course of a few hours on weeknights and during the day I would find any excuse to drink a beer. Nice weather=go out an drink a beer in the sun. Phillies are on= grab a cold one and kick back and watch the game. Going over my friends to hang by the pool= make sure to bring that 12 pack or case. 

I don’t want to be pessimistic but I have tried in the past to quit had some success only to detract from that success by replacing one bad/dangerous habit with another. I also worry about the impact withdrawal symptoms will have on my bipolar disorder. I already am depressed. I already have anxiety. I already have lost interest in things I once in enjoyed. I’ve already withdrawn from my friends and the outside world and started to isolate myself. I’m scared the symptoms of withdrawal are going to push my limits with handling these feelings/emotions/behaviors. 

I wish there was a way I could keep weed in my life but just do it in moderation and have rules around it. One rule could be no smoking before 9 PM. Another could be no smoking during the work week, etc. But it seems like when you have issues with weed as bad as mine everyone’s advice is to quit altogether. But, honestly, the thought of never being able to smoke again depresses me. Even though I just wrote about all the terrible things it has caused or contributed to, there is still a big part of me that enjoys it, misses it, and wishes I could get high right now. And also I’m trying to quit but am I quitting forever? For a month? For a year? I’d like to think I don’t have to quit for ever. Instead I’m hoping to go completely sober for at least a month (probably longer) and then reintroduce weed and use it much more sparingly with similar rules as mentioned above governing my usage. But then I read or hear that this is wrong approach and I can never go back. But my thought process is if I can go without it completely for a significant period of time then I should eventually be able to use it but only sparingly. Going without it for a time will teach me self control and that I don’t NEED weed to survive on a daily basis. 

It’s all very confusing. Not sure which approach to take. Don’t want to say bye to weed forever. Just want it out of my life now so I can get back on track and accomplish my goals."
