\- Uklanja pitanje ""A sta danas da obucem?"" - deca bi se brze spremila za skolu. Slican efekat kao kad neko ima iskljucivo jednobojne, crne carape. Uniforma se slaze sa ostatkom uniforme.

\- Smanjilo bi diskriminaciju 

\- Deca bi se manje opterecivala izgledom 

Lose strane:

\- Morali bismo da biramo izmedju skupe uniforme koju vecina roditelja moze samo uz kredit da plati, i necega sto lici na radnicku kecelju. Kompromis bi mogao da bude obicna majca + farmerke (identicni), ali i tad bi postojale letnja i zimska varijanta, kao i rezerva uniforma. Cak i u minimalnoj realizaciji, to bi bilo opterecenje za vecinu roditelja.

\- Ne bi mogli kreativno da se izrazavaju kroz oblacenje. Ovo mozda i nije toliko lose - vikend bi bio vise ""poseban"", a mogli bi da se kreativno izrazavaju i kroz druge aktivnosti.

\- S obzirom na to koliko je sve korumpirano, sigurno bi se neko ugradio. Posto bi uniforme bile obavezne, njihovu cenu bi kontrolisalo samo to koliko roditelji mogu da plate. Ako se ikad uvedu uniforme, glasam za jednobojne, genericke majce, koje bi mogle bilo gde da se kupe.

My guess:

-In the serious department, the situation would be reversed, as most of the girls would opt for serious/non hook up stuff. Like, an average boy could score a 10/10.

By serious I don't mean arranged marriage, but more like...a lot of dating/meeting family and friends before sex. Sure, it would feel like a friend zone with occasional kisses and romantic stuff.

Examples: going to college/ taking a job in a distant place (other continent), changing appearance drastically without considering particular person's preference, socializing with other people (non-sexually) without fear that SO would misinterpret as cheating, changing hobbies, dealing with mental health, not having to call someone each day/often/ever, being able to go wherever without judgement, starting a PhD while the other person would rather start a family, drastically changing diet or sleeping schedule, taking unusual vacation...

Sure, you could say that you can do most of that while in relationship. But in some cases, you would have to talk to the other person and compromise. Especially if you're living with them. It is practical for some people to stay single while figuring out different lifestyles.
