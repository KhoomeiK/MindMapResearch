> the view from within ones’ home looks much like the apocalypse, as the economy spirals in turmoil while people heed their governor’s orders to “stay home.” Venturing out to the grocery store or for a stroll in nature brings about a surreal feeling of being in the twilight zone as people keep their distance while sporting masks and gloves. They have managed to sink the population into fear and despair, while battling it out over the “cure” for this virus that has swept the nation, or so they say. It’s hard for most people to see past their fears, their financial situation, and trying to cope in a situation everyone was forced into, not to mention the elevated anger everyone is feeling from freedoms being unnecessarily stripped away. But, this is about much more than a “cure” for COVID-19.

Codependency,fp5jt0i,t3_gbcxud,1588331913.0,"I have been having the same questions about this exact experience. 

The only difference is, I absolutely care so much about bonding, that maybe i think I believe i am bonding, but the reality is, I am going through this too. 

About me, I love sharing and talking with very specific people and viseversa, if the other person doesn’t want to share and bond, i do give them space, but, if they still want to be apart of my life, it’s just in other ways. But, i always still share, so now, i am curious after reading your post, if maybe they dont want me to share? Maybe i am a nuance on them. I have never even considered this. Just took their individuality and loved them for it. Once in awhile, they will share with me, but not usually, and i do give them the attention they give me, and usually that’s just listening and validating when they do. But, now i am wondering if they think if i even care, i do care and i want them to be confident in their own experiences, because they are just as important. But, if they are uncomfortable with me sharing or if they think i am over sharing, id want them to tell me, like recently, a friend told me to reach out to my therapist about somethings and i did, and it was absolutely so helpful, because I probably would have just kept over sharing till I finally felt good... and that’s not at all how this healing works.

Once i was actually taken to the hopital because the blisters weren’t healing, but they all looked like just regular scabs and not some burn by time the doctor say me. They said they had no idea what it was or what happened to me. I shook my head and started crying at the doctors office. The doctor got upset as well and told them to get me back home and gave them a prescription for something, i still have no idea for what... my entire body was in pain for days, weeks after, my legs and feet hurt the most. I had scabs between my toes. I didn’t go to school for a long time. I got to see my school records and i misses the majority of that year with sick days. SO...As a survivor, i can actually advocate maybe more for the child than anyone else, but this is a topic that should be talked about, the children never get to have their say, they never get to say anything, it’s always about everyone else, including the abuser. I know i havent had the best of times growing up, but wholeheartedly believe, we should never ever stop talking about this stuff."
TrueCrime,fo2kr4w,t1_fo1txza,1587466117.0,"I am so sorry if i seem to be not respectful, that is not my intention. I am genuinely concerned, interested, and almost trying to prepare myself for the worst. Something like this could easily happen to anyone, by accident or on purpose. Im always going to think the worst, but that’s something i need to work on, since I already have lost so much faith in some people. I should read some more of this thread, i been just chatting with you. So I apologize, I haven’t read anything more, i have been still hung up on the actions of this man, he has ruined not only the surviving child but the entire family. I apologize if i am coming off so strong. But, there so much more to all of this, and if this mother is in shock, she needs all of our help. There is no way i would know how to deal with this on my own in the aftermath. We are talking years of emotional pain, and physical pain."
TrueCrime,fo1mck1,t1_fo1l3nj,1587436446.0,"The insanity that would break out in that moment would always be painful.. it would break me, for years.... so, id hope to do everything i could to never repeat that mistake again. Even it means being single and having to do things a lot differently for what might feel like forever. Every time youd go bath your child now, it will be a constant reminder of what happened, and how do you console yourself and your child at the same time as they need you to help them understand they are safe now. This one moment has now cause a life time of trauma."
