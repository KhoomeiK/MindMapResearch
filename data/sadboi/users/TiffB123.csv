EatingDisorders,fjbdxx8,t1_fj59rnd,1583191186.0,"Hi, I'm a 17 year old girl (pretty much one of the most statistically likely person to have an eating disorder lol) from the UK as well. I just wanted to tell you that going to your gp is genuinely the best advice I could give you. My anorexia started when I was 11 years old, quite overweight and very shy. When I'd talk to a friend about it, they would say that it's good because I was so fat anyway, so I believed them and simply stopped eating and didn't even think there was a problem with it. My family forced me to to the gp, who did not focus on the fact that I was overweight and that losing the weight would probably ""do me some good"". She focused on WHY I wanted to lose weight, and a lot of my reasons were the exact same as yours. But I wasn't able to stop  myself because I was so obsessed with the idea of 'I'll stop once I get to a healthy weight'. Skip to a few months later, and I was still overweight (less so, but still overweight) so I still wasn't eating causing me to end up in the hospital for 4 months because of my ED, self harm and suicidal thoughts. Please, please do not think that your struggles aren't valid or don't mean anything because that's the same reasoning that lost me my entire childhood. Thin does NOT equal healthy, and neither is starving yourself. Please seek help and don't stop until you find a medical professional willing to give you it, I promise it will be the best thing you ever do"
