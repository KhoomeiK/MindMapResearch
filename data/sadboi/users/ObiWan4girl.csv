And I'm getting so frickin tired on good days. I literally can have a good day and have fun but once I start thinking about suicide again I can't have fun anymore.

On bad days, I usually curse myself for being such a coward and for not being able to make decisions. I also curse my mother for being terminally ill, because I know that if I kill myself she would die too. Not that she will be too sad or anything.

Sometimes I do manage to have a good day even if I have the thoughts again. It usually happens when I go out with a specific friend of mine. But the problem is that aside from afterschool hangouts I can't talk to her at all. And often after school I have no strength at all, I can barely get out of my bed, not to mention that unless necesary I never get out of my room. 

So I'm stuck, and it's so damn painfull."
