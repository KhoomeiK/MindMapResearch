BPD,fni26sw,t3_g1uoz1,1586972718.0,"I think a diagnosis gives you a roadmap that tells what types of things might be helpful and things to look out for as well as a framework to put everything in. Everyone's a little different, but I think the general ideas are helpful.

I'm quiet and no one would ever guess that I have BPD based on my actions, but my head is full of a lot of toxicity and I am working very hard to be better. I had this fantasy of ""coming out BPD"" where the whole world could see that BPD wasn't narcissism, and not everyone with BPD acted a certain way, and then everyone would change their views and the world would accept people with mental illnesses... Then I realized that all of the kind, introspective people wouldn't change their views about me at all, since they had always been accepting; and all the negative, self-centered people would dismiss the new evidence, and point back to that one time in 2014 when I cussed at another driver giving them evidence to preserve their worldviews. We can't control what others think. We are not our diagnoses."
BPD,fmx9g86,t1_fmwv8n1,1586460878.0,"For me, getting my inner critic to settle down a little helped a lot. I think there's a combination of approval/gratitude and acceptance/validation that go together to help get there. E.g., I want to tell you that IRL production is over-rated, and that you have value just by being you. I really believe that about you, but I have a hard time believing that about myself. Since that is too difficult for me right now, I'm going to do something easy, like appreciate myself for appreciating a song I'm listening to. I'm enjoying the song, and it is amazing that I'm able to listen to this work of art that someone else made and I appreciate all the people that went into getting those sounds to my ears right now, from the people who made the speakers, to wi-fi, to the internet, to the first guy who banged a stick on a rock. When I'm unable to do this, it is usually my critic judging me for not being productive, or not having written my own song, or for not being in the moment and being critical instead--so my critic is criticizing me for listening to him!

So my suggestion is to start small. Maybe try reminding yourself that you are thankful that you took a hot shower today, pleased that you read a little about BPD just now, maybe you approve of the weather today, and know that you made a post that helped remind me that I need to notice my own merit, too."

I understand wanting to know what you're supposed to feel or how you're supposed to react, and I think that is a symptom as well. We were not allowed to feel our own feelings, shamed for feeling them, so we look outside in the hopes of feeling the correct emotion.

If your calculations show you should be using, say, 50, 55, and 60, but the machine only says 40, 50, 60, you'll have to compromise, and maybe do 50, 60, 60 or 40, 50, 60.

For the assistance, don't worry too much. Things like rows, pull-ups, and face-pulls should probably always be in 5/3/1 assistance to make sure you are getting enough back work (I also think lunges are awesome) but the rest doesn't matter. There's a number of ways to progress. Say you want to stay around 3x15 (three sets of fifteen reps) on accessories. Maybe when you can hit 3x20, or 5x15, go up in weight and try for 3-5x10.
