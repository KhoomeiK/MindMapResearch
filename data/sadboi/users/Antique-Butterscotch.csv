I was struggling to restrict and not binge, it stressed me the fuck out and I felt like I was going crazy, and I think I turned a lot of my self-hatred (of being heavier than I’d like and not achieving my goal by binging) onto others to make myself feel better, I guess it was like, “at least I’m not that fat” kind of comparison (with the people “lower” than you cuz obviously I felt like shit compared to those “higher” ones lol) mentality. It’s usually not towards people irl tho, but rather I’d binge watch Supersize vs Superskinny and the like on Youtube and of course read the comment section. I’d never and had never treat anyone differently solely because of their weight, but I definitely felt contempt and like I was better than them and was doing something right by weighing less, then. It was a really unhealthy outlet for my negative and warped feelings towards food, weight, body image, self-esteem, shame, etc. It’s hard to admit, and I’m glad to say that I’m wayyy less malicious, cynical, and judgmental towards the people in question these days, but yeah, I’ve had some shameful and ugly thoughts."

UnsentLetters,fpqi2ay,t3_e956jr,1588823288.0,"Gonna write this down before I forget it although I’ve already forgotten much of it the moment I woke up.

So last night I had a dream that we somehow had interactions either in person and/or texting, but I heard from you through two different platforms with quite a few messages and the last ones read something along the lines of “I’m really not into you at all anymore”. You said it with so much certainty, it felt quite cruel, but that’s not unusual. To make things worse tho, this girl who I’ve always felt inferior to was somehow also in the dream and you met her. You were telling me something like, how angelic and cute and perfect she was, I can’t recall the exact verbiage, but she was like a doll, with perfect skin and looks and such. She really is though, she’s so easy to fall in love with, and you saw and did just that. I remember myself thinking if you knew we had the same birthdays. Regardless, it wasn’t a great feeling, at all. I wish I could just know that it’s reality already. I wish I could stop being stupid and actually believe what I think and move on.

Wow. It’s been 3 months since we last talked. Haha. April was truly like hell for me, depressed month who? And so was the beginning of May. They went by so fast. Everything went by so fast.

I heard today that there might be lots of hurricane coming up this year, I hope you’ll be coping well. And this is the least and most I could do. Unless we’ll be in contact then, which I highly, 99.9 percently doubt."

UnsentLetters,fpex3fh,t1_fpewabn,1588556833.0,And yeah that of course means the perhaps most important part that I really really really need to stop reminiscing the good parts and imagining us being together still/again lmfao.
UnsentLetters,fpewabn,t3_e956jr,1588556328.0,"I really, really shouldn’t be thinking of you like this, like sure I could keep the hope that one day perhaps we’ll connect in some way again, hopefully romantically but that’s unlikely but, before that happens I need not have that hope and wish in my heart, yeah I still love you but I shouldn’t fuel that love, like you weren’t, I gotta try to think of you less and less, especially in the romantic sense, actually accept that you’re out of my life, and I don’t need to think about you when it comes to everything in my life, what you might think of something, what you might like, what you dislike; your opinions shouldn’t matter to me. You, unfortunately, should be like just a stranger to me, I will unavoidably think of you, but I can’t fuel that thought, in fact I gotta discourage it, remind myself constantly, X isn’t in your life anymore, they’re not relevant to you in any way shape or form anymore. You’re not relevant to them anymore. They stopped loving you long time ago. They quenched the fuel almost instantly. It’s the right thing to do for you to do the same, even though it’s been way too long, long after they did it, but it’s not too late. X has left. The end."
UnsentLetters,fpcmr3u,t1_fpcmdri,1588506300.0,"It’s like the same reason why I’m in so much distress that I’m ugly and a failure lmfao, cuz I just never want to actually believe it but I’ll be so much happier and at-peace if I could just accept it fundamentally. It’s so hard isn’t it? Have I really accepted anything negative in my life so far and not go flip flopping back and forth over how I feel about it? Yeah. It’s so damn hard. But it’s necessary. It is."
UnsentLetters,fpcmdri,t3_e956jr,1588505924.0,"I think I had a dream last night about one of us, probably you, sending voice messages to me somewhere somehow. I remember feeling, wow, are we really doing this, I’m hearing your voice again? I think that’s what happened rather than the roles being reversed, but either way, I was surprised that we were again listening to the other’s voice.

Maybe in my mind that signals being closer and our relationship, in general, being better than just two acquaintances texting politely. Hearing one’s voice is quite intimate to me, I guess.

Oh and I just really realized that if I’m not special in any way in life and definitely not a person selected and blessed by a supreme power, why would I be particularly lucky when it comes to relationships? Just because someone has dated me doesn’t mean they will love me forever. I am just like every girl who has been dumped, it’s simple, I’m unwanted, I’m not special, just like it has never happened before in my life, it’s not happening this time either. Life has shown me the truth, you have told me how you felt, but I just refused to accept and believe it.

I guess that’s the key, really, really understand that I’m not special or lucky, and so it’s only expected and normal and realistic that you would’ve moved on and not thinking about me like the way I think about you anymore. I say it all the time, and I do mean it when I say it, that you’ve moved on from me long ago, but I never truly, wholeheartedly, believed it like it’s gospel.

I must. I can’t have hopes and expectations that things would be different for me and I’ll be Cinderella anymore. It’s not impossible that I will find the right person who’s nearly everything that I’ve wanted, but not this time.

I need to I need to I need to. I will believe it eventually. I will. I have to. I will see and accept reality. I’m not special to X. X isn’t thinking about me. That is ok. Someone in the future will want me the way I want them to. I might never meet that person but just who knows. X tho? It’s said and done. There’s evidence. I gotta remind myself of it, over, and over, and over again.

Goodbye X, for the millionth time, thanks for making me feel loved at certain points, I will forever remember and cherish them, and it still tears my heart apart to think that it’s possible that I will never have that again with you, that we’re truly not meant to be together and done for good, but I will heal, tiny bit by bit.

Goodbye, someone who I’ve loved more than I’ve loved anyone else romantically in my life, this is so hard for me, but it just validates that I’m facing a great challenge, and it’s ok and expected to heal and move on so slowly, but every bit of success, of me realizing the truth and reality, of me refraining from reaching out to you, is commendable.

Goodbye, someone."

i want to stop missing you. i kinda just want to forget and avoid everything between us, but at the same time i wish i could talk to you, just not about the issues. it hurts to think, especially cuz i know you won’t have the patience or care to. and so it would hurt more to do.

perhaps it’s destiny, it’s the lord telling me that you’re not the right person by not making you love me back the same way i love you, that the future is for someone else, someone better for me. i want you to be that person, but it’s nearly, if not totally impossible it seems. it’s in your nature, and i can’t change you, neither would you want to change for me. and it’s true, i’m not good for you anyway either, you deserve someone who’s more like you, who wouldn’t run into so many problems with you. i might be willing to work on the problems, but i don’t try hard enough and maybe i just can’t fix them, it’s in my nature. such simple notion yet i can’t, i just can’t accept it. i wish i have my heart completely broken and shattered into unmendable pieces so i wouldn’t be stuck here right now. i feel like i might never move on. i miss you daily, tbh a lot of it is physical, i can’t imagine anything besides you, you always come back to my mind. maybe i just need to try harder and harder, but this is the easier way out, and in a way i separate it from the real world, but it does get in the way of moving on big time. i really am quite disappointed with everything that i don’t have much hopes regarding that but physically i can’t shake."

No one deserves me lmfao. K told me tonight that I reply to everything someone says pretty much and I thought of why I do that. It’s cuz I know how much it sucks to be on the other side.

Probably not enough to get drunk let alone throw up and cry (ok maybe that one is possible), but it’s something, and it’s my way of doing da pahty. Lol, kinda ironic that it’s what I wish I could’ve done on mine, lol. Although not watching a movie.

Anyway. Stay safe eh. Goodbye, one more time, stranger."
UnsentLetters,fmv2541,t3_e956jr,1586404199.0,"Wow I can’t wait for this to be over lmfao why am I kinda anxious lmfao. I was washing my hair just now and I could actually kinda imagined us being friends years later and like I’d be able to see you with a new person and be ok with it and I was just like wow. These moments are rare and I wish they stay. I think one day it will stick. I realized that because this is my first relationship I’m having an especially hard time with letting go just like when I had to let my best friends go for the first time when I was young, but with time you realize that some people, no matter how much you like them and wish they could stay in your life, they won’t. You’ve taught me a lot, thank you."
