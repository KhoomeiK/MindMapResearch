wholesomememes,fphw56c,t3_gdh3vl,1588628904.0,"This makes me think of a moment I shared with my dog, Toffee, who passed away 2016. We had her for 16 years, the best 16 years of my life.

When I was 18 (now F26), I had tried to take my own life by overdose. I remember sitting on my bed crying writing my suicide note when Toffee came in to my room and stood by the door staring at me as I cried. It felt like she knew what was happening.

I remember cuddling her and crying, and crying, she couldn’t say anything, but I know she knew I was in indescribable pain. It was a moment I’ll remember forever. I miss her ❤️

Thankfully things have changed since then and I got the help I needed, but if I had the chance to go back to that moment I’d savour that cuddle even more."

relationship_advice,fp9e14z,t3_gc5cxy,1588423596.0,"I’ve experienced this, I was with my ex for 2.5 years and he was my absolute best friend. We did everything together, had so much fun and he treated me like I was royalty. Honestly, no one I’ve dated since him has managed to keep up with how well he treated me. He set the bar.

The only problem was, I found myself becoming less and less sexually attracted to him. I still wanted to be around him because he was my best friend, but I had lost all interest in him romantically. I didn’t even realise that I had, I just knew that I really didn’t want to have sex with him anymore. I even questioned my sexuality at one point. I ended up not having sex with him for over a year and ended up putting it down to low libido. It wasn’t a low libido.

He had no motivation to ever leave home and get a job, while I was living abroad and chasing my dreams. We were on two completely different paths and I definitely had outgrown him. I then realised I had to put my own happiness first, and this is the advice I want to give to you. If you’ve found that you’ve checked out emotionally, it is very difficult to come back from that... especially if there is no sex taking place. I suggest you have a conversation with him, tell him exactly how you feel, maybe some time apart might change how you feel? You’ve been with your boyfriend for 3 years, you seem to have outgrown him, which can happen when your partner doesn’t share the same drive you do.

The bottom line is no matter the outcome, you’ll be fine, I promise. If you do choose to break up, know that it will be hard, but ending a relationship you’re not truly happy in is honestly one of the most freeing experiences ever.

Best of luck, OP!"

AskReddit,foalus5,t3_g69kfu,1587648853.0,"I remember sitting with a group of friends on the school football pitch on a really nice sunny day just minding our own business. Guys from a few years above us were playing football and messing around. 

All of a sudden I see an apple flying through the air at a really fucking high speed. It proceeds to hit one of the girls in my group in the face with such a force that the apple literally split in to two parts. Everyone was freaking out incase she went blind or something.

There was also this one time a kid tried to sneak out of school during lunch time, as only sixth formers were allowed to leave the premises for lunch. 

Basically he climbed over a spiked fence, it ended up going through his finger and through his neck. Literally sliced through his entire finger to the point where it was hanging on by a thread. Weirdly enough though, he didn’t die from the fence going through his neck. Got lucky I guess!"
