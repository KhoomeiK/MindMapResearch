unclebens,fji9nc5,t1_fjgg8ed,1583363014.0,Oops - that post was meant to say 3bags 🤦🏼‍♀️. I think the aborts were due to too much spawn and not enough coir to handle that much pinning at once

When there is green mold it releases a fucktonne of spores everywhere that are probably (tbh noone seems to know for sure) best removed with bleach otherwise they will still be in the air and on everything soooo bleach bomb literally every surface you have before you start another tub otherwise its likely to fail

I am 29 now and was living with undiagnosed depression and anxiety since I was 12 and have had suicidal tendencies since then... it does get easier and it IS worth it.   
You said yourself that mushrooms have always been a healing process for you (they are for me too) and then you added in a partner that had never experienced them and it fell apart - what that says to me is that he needs to understand the medicinal value of this substance on his own - like you did. It sounds like he has ALOT to deal with - that isnt your responsibility, you need to work on you and love yourself before you can love another. Trust me - loving yourself is the important lesson in life, once you are at peace with you then you can support another who is finding their way.  


This life is hard, but it does get easier and it is worth it - keep going. I promise you will come out the other side of this. Dont shy away from mushrooms because of this, just keep putting yourself in situations where they are healing to you. It's clear you can recognise negative triggers - show foresight and have the strength to say no when the setting isnt what it should be.

You can do this :)

Oh, and weed always made my anxiety worse because it would just take me deeper - I dont suggest taking it, but we probably have a different relationship with it. Only you truly know if it's a good idea or not... be strong."
