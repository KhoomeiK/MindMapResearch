kratom,fbygemc,t3_ef16q6,1577216238.0,I found that tossing more than a teaspoon at a time makes a big mess.  I usually take 3 t.  Or a scant tablespoon (2x daily).  Toss and wash just makes a big mess for me.  Shake it in a bottle with water (not much water). ..its easier.
kratom,fbyg6rx,t3_ef16q6,1577216085.0,"Nooooo! Don't inhale it!   I use a disposable water bottle and a funnel. I fill water bottle with about a finger of water. Use the funnel or make a funnel out of paper..put my dose in..shake it and down the hatch.  Have something to back it with...or after downing , put bottle under tap to get the remaining kratom that clings to bottle and wash it down again.
Toss and wash can work, but everything needs to be just right..i have yet to be able to toss and wash consistently without some kind of a mess.
I tend to get Kratom dust all over me.  There is no way I can hide my use!"

I found that watching the clock and letting ten minutes pass without doing anything helped.

My psychiatrist confirmed that I had it..and that little was known about treatment (20 years ago). He said that in some cases it just vanished.  

Waiting and being mindful for 10-30 mins helps me."
