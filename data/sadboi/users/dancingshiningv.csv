business,fnj39eg,t1_fnixatj,1586991139.0,"I’ve been reading more and presenting one or the other is more about a context thing. Also, if you’re a tech company, pitch decks are more common. It’s a meme w/o context, agreed. But it still made me wonder and ask around here. Thanks!"
business,fnj300r,t1_fniyxca,1586991000.0,I was thinking about that. Presenting a pitch deck in this particular case would still be an investment of time that might end up in them refusing my option. Thanks!

If a  company needs Slidebean and they can’t afford the subscription at the moment, the CEO encourages people to [shoot him a tweet](https://twitter.com/caya_c137) and he’ll help out. We are prepared to discount our services for companies that are struggling, as well as offering monthly plans (which don't currently exist).

Hope it helps!‍"

WFH,fkxq83d,t1_fkwln1r,1584633298.0,"Thank you for sharing! I hope your surgery recovery is fast and safe! I'll search for those standing desks you mention, I'd love one! 

I kinda understand where you come from... I don't have a roommate, but my mom (who lives abroad) came to visit last month. The plan was for her to stay at my sister's a few days and here other days, but now we're stuck in my teeny-tiny studio apartment. 

That being said, and since you requested tips, I think that if you gather more energy after recovering, another conversation with your roommate is in order. Maybe from a place of how you feel, instead of what they're ""doing to you""... it'd also be useful, if they definitely don't want to move the office to the room (unfair to me), to establish time limitations, not only space limitations, so you can at least cook and have your meals at ease. 

With my mom, it required more than one ""talk"", but we're sloooowly reaching some sort of a routine. I tolerate her TV on with the news most of the time, but if I have a call or if I'm working out, she has to turn it off. She tolerates that I'm prepping breakfast while she's still sleeping... and so on. We'll get there...

Good luck!"

Dance,fk3z3e6,t3_fgdm02,1583849776.0,"I love you seem to be so clear on your dream of dancing! Here’s what I would do:
- Talk to my parents about this very seriously. If you are not supported by them, at least they know.
- Don’t stop dancing. If there aren’t enough local hip hop classes, I’d take other disciplines or even go online. Platforms like Steezy can work. 
- Go on Instagram or TikTok where most dancers have accounts and share their tour dates for workshops and intensives. Galen Hooks has an amazing one for beginners (a goal for me) and you can check out where do they take place. 
- You are 15. The world is ahead of you ❤️
Good luck!"

Antibacterial wipes and spray are always available at the office so we can dissinfect our computers/headphones/mobiles/surfaces, and the hand washing, coughing/sneezing protocols keep being reminded via internal messaging. Staffers had plans to attend a couple of major events in the US but these have been cancelled. More measures may/will be taken as the situation evolves in both offices, Costa Rica and NYC."
