wholesomememes,fr2omld,t1_fr2c7z1,1589840986.0,There are so many variables within this question. It’s impossible to answer. For a year when I was covered by a parent’s private insurance I paid a $10 copay and saw the therapist weekly. Currently I pay no copay so it’s free for me. I go weekly now too. Well it’s Telehealth currently. But these two situations are very different and it’s possible I live in an area with better access to mental health services.

mentalillness,fomy568,t1_fomu6dj,1587907359.0,"I agree about a therapist and anger. Also it sounds like everyone is frustrated and the frustration is undermining your worth. Having an addiction doesn’t make you worthless.  Having an addiction means you have a problem you need to deal with. It’s pretty easy for too many people to feel ashamed of our problems but we’re only human and not perfect. You have some good insight since you see the addiction and how it’s not a good mentality. Use the insight and work with a therapist to find out why you dislike yourself so much. It’s easier to not dwell on destructive thoughts if you can redirect yourself to you actually enjoy, rather than continuing to avoid something with the addiction. It’s not easy but it’s worth it."

AmItheAsshole,fnfilk9,t3_g1268l,1586908751.0,"I’m reading my own experience in your situation, OP. So if I’m way off just disregard.

I’m sensing the sibling rivalry is a HUGE source of continuing pain and that it is borne from your parent’s treatment of you and your sister. It’s only been in the years after my one sibling died that I’ve been seeing clearly how shitty my parents were, and how they were responsible for the rift we felt as siblings. The gaps in favoritisms were hugely in her favorite. With my mom, I was absolutely always wrong when it came to an argument with sis. Well I was wrong at everything according to mom especially, but also dad. 

You gotta deal with it. 

I’m voting NTA. I’m fairly certain the remarks you made to your sister were designed to hurt her. I’ll give the benefit of the doubt concerning how you treat your sisters kid when around her. Saying anything to the kid about all this, her existence basically being bad, should be off limits. The kid is innocent.

My own experience of being treated unfairly leaves me thinking the comment was somehow “deserved” in the sense that favoritism so incredibly toxic and venting a little bit is hard to avoid. But there’s a point where you - and sis - become accountable for your actions and the attitudes that guide them. You are in large part who you were raised to be, but there’s a point to claim responsibility and become the person you want to be. Living in anger is not living.

If I’m right on any counts, please get into therapy. It helps. Maybe r/RaisedByNarcissists would help illuminate some things? I’m not sure. I’m just adding it because it’s recently been helpful for me."

Sorry that therapist did that. I’ve been with a non profit clinic for quite a while (as a patient/client) and the providers before the clinic were not great. Not everyone at the clinic is great either, but I’ve been mostly lucky finding ones I could work with.

I have experienced this. And my mom doesn’t actually love me either. You can read about my mom’s kind of crazy over at r/RaisedByNarcissists. I’m the good kind of crazy. I have issues I’m working on but I try to do good and be nice to people. Your comment about not wanting to be your mom makes me think the same applies to you. Simply being aware you don’t want to be that kind of person is great guidance into a different direction. 

Did therapy help? Is more therapy (with a different therapist) possible? I had to forgive myself for a whole lot of things. I’m just now getting into dealing with my own trauma in therapy and don’t have much I can share. It’s still very confusing to me. But just in case you need to hear it, you don’t have to forgive them. Any forgiveness is for your own peace. 

Maybe you can relate to my recent thoughts... I am trying to forgive myself for being hurt. For not dealing better. For not leaving childhood unscathed. For being weak and vulnerable. For being a kid. For basically being human. None of it is something I’ve done wrong but it’s stuff I’ve felt needlessly guilty for. I went through a version of hell so it’s no surprise I came out angry too. 

I’m sorry if I’m talking about myself too much. It’s just the way I communicate the ideas when I’m unsure how else to say it. Hang in there. With the obstacles you’ve overcome and goals you’ve reached and just looking for help somewhere ... I’m betting you’ll figure it out."

The not understanding why or feeling like I did it to myself somehow kind of drove me crazy for a long time. I definitely thought I didn’t deserve compassion. I thought I needed to try harder or toughen up or something else my jerk parents probably taught me to think. But that was lies even if they thought they were the truth. 

Mental illness is complicated for sure. It’s your responsibility to learn to manage it but you 100% deserve compassion regardless if you have a “good reason” to be depressed. The process of learning the skills to improve your life can be a little slow but you deserve compassion at all points of the journey. One of those skills I had to learn actually was compassion. It was tough but I went from very suicidal for many years to actually wanting to live.

AmItheAsshole,fibcs7g,t3_f7d1as,1582319255.0,"Wow. Forcing you to sign the check is effed up af. Soooooo NTA. I’m assuming your parents were pretty manipulative when alive too, and the people who are speaking against you are probably all enablers. 

To be fair, I’ve been reading r/RaisedByNarcissists for the last hour, but I don’t see how there wasn’t a lot of other bs and potentially abusive behavior going on if your parents planned to manipulate you from the grave. 

People don’t know what they don’t know. The people speaking against your decisions haven’t been in your shoes, experienced your experiences, felt what you felt, but it doesn’t mean you’re wrong at all. I’m just some internet stranger but I think you handled it perfectly."

mentalillness,fi1d3f9,t3_f5u3vz,1582055343.0,"That really doesn’t sound right. I don’t really have anything helpful to add about the specific situation but...

It can be just a diagnosis and not necessarily a disability. Many people with mental illness support themselves. On the other hand many people receive SSI because they can’t and have proven themselves as disabled. I’ve heard of special accommodations but don’t know anything about them or the definition of disability in that context. 

I’ve heard that once you’ve been diagnosed bipolar, you always are bipolar, but the context may be important. I think this was mentioned when I was sharing that a new psychiatrist diagnosed me with depression rather than bipolar which had been my diagnosis before that point. But it may be completely different if you’re not being treated for bipolar and you are thriving. I’m not a doctor or any type of mental health professional. 

I really think they’re taking it way too far by requesting your records. Is there any way that not disclosing a past mental illness diagnosis could bite you in the butt later? I don’t know myself, but if there is a chance this comes up again in the future, it would be good to know. Heck, I’d like to know. But it’s not something that would be on xrays or lab tests so idk"

therapy,fhpl6v0,t3_f4a747,1581791744.0,"Bad therapist or not, this doesn’t seem to be a good fit. At all. Wish I had something to offer but I expect it will be difficult if not impossible to urge your friend to see someone else. Perhaps you could google the therapist. Maybe there’s a pattern of clients regressing. Idk where you’d go from there but it is the only action I can think of. 

That said, I actually got a whole lot worse in some ways before I got better. It can be part of the process but I’ve been part of the extreme end of mentally ill. I’m on disability. I don’t know if that’s why my journey was like that."

therapy,fhpa9fh,t3_f48prb,1581785049.0,"Try looking for a not for profit community mental health clinic. I’ve had several caring therapists but all of them were at such a place. The ones at private practices definitely seemed more concerned about money. It’s not a rule either way (not for profit doesn’t guarantee caring and private practice isn’t devoid of caring) but maybe the probability increases? It’s just my experience to have a lot of success with caring therapists at that type of clinic. Though I had to wade through a couple crappy ones too.

I believe therapy can be much more than “paying for a friend” (as I’ve heard some clients’ experiences seem to be) and if finding irl friends is an issue a good therapist should help to find healthy friendships."

mentalillness,fhmj64c,t1_fhlwjbs,1581713556.0,I think they are oblivious that they are avoiding their own feelings of inferiority. They can’t stand the idea they’re not perfect so they do anything to convince themselves they are. There’s also a feeling of being justified in seeking revenge. I’m not sure they are unaware of it but don’t care about who they hurt.
mentalillness,fhmilni,t1_fhmcz4x,1581713319.0,"I can confirm. I knew something was very wrong before I had any idea what it was. Could see some of my actions I knew weren’t right but the big feelings behind them, the confusion about what was happening, and the complete lack of knowing what else to do about it prevented changing on my own. Lots of therapy later, I have self awareness and am very different. I believe that my bpd was learned via trauma. I thought I’ve read personality disorders generally are learned but I’m not a professional."

OCD,ffk5mfl,t3_etwiv6,1580016634.0,Sounds like me 100%. I use what I’ve dubbed “disqualifiers” to take away any certainty in my statements. I sometimes use disqualifiers. I might use disqualifiers. I spend way too much time thinking about which words to use to be exact when I remember but then I start doubting my memory and go back and say/type “it may have been” etc. and right now I’m going to - with high anxiety - post without re-editing this ten times and ultimately deleting it.

Sh!t still sucks pretty often but it’s still much much better. I took therapy very seriously with an effective therapist and it made all the difference. I honestly believe that if I can do it anyone can. 

No a switch doesn’t just flip when you survive. People sometimes just can’t understand what they haven’t experienced. It makes them ignorant of issues related to serious depression. Some may really listen when you explain, some won’t.  But it doesn’t mean they have bad intentions. Some of it is because it’s all they know because it’s all they’ve seen - on tv. They won’t know better unless they are told otherwise."
