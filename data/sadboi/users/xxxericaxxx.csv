I have anxiety depression bpd and add. I need a therapist though for sure that‚Äôs the next step because I agree starting medicine without therapy doesn‚Äôt actually cure you.

I was starting to feel better also the previous day bc I started yoga. I‚Äôm thinking of getting on Lexapro because my body knows it from before. Thanks for talking to me even though it felt kind of harsh lol. I‚Äôm just worried about taking medicine because of future withdrawal but I know I need help and to combine it with therapy. üíô

It‚Äôs a female I‚Äôm almost positive as it seems like she is in heat right now. I‚Äôm not sure about being around other pets and it will take her just a little while to warm up to you and feel safe but she adapts so quick in the right environment. She interacts well with my hamster but I‚Äôm not sure about anything that isn‚Äôt caged. She might be about six months I‚Äôm not sure at all I haven‚Äôt taken her in!! She is long but still such a kitten lol. She‚Äôs so cute and wants love she just has to trust you first and feel safe and knows you will continue to feed her. She has had trauma for sure and is constantly rubbing on my feet and now is okay with petting and she speaks a lot to me and is very vocal and a quick learner. It‚Äôs going to be hard to let her go seriously but it would be best for her to go to a home that is allowed to have pets and isn‚Äôt allergic and wants a long term commitment!

I would seek out for a therapist and confiding in a close friend if you have any.  I would definitely keep my distance from him and don‚Äôt feel obligated to go around them or him for any reason until you are feeling better. You don‚Äôt have to feel obligated to feel any certain way. That is painful and traumatizing. I‚Äôm sorry. You are NOT overreacting.

abuse,fn0kxjg,t3_fyhrw1,1586543837.0,"try looking up things about BPD (borderline personality disorder) and how you can help as a partner and to understand her better. I‚Äôm not saying she is in the right, and I know you need security and love and just care about what‚Äôs right, but your partner is having this meltdown so easily from past trauma and it‚Äôs most likely beyond her control. I can relate to these acts of hers, like her responses and explosions and I have borderline traits and insane anxiety and depression and ocd. I just know that sometimes even though I‚Äôm causing more harm than good and say things so meanly and seriously, it‚Äôs out of my control and it‚Äôs scary. Substance abuse is a huge concept in personality disorders or being empathetic because you feel too much. Maybe you‚Äôve hurt her in the past and she is still hurt or hates herself for some reasons or maybe just hasn‚Äôt acknowledged what‚Äôs fucked her over in life and is destroying her health and baby‚Äôs wellbeing and losing her shit. It‚Äôs shitty and that makes me feel angry knowing she is drinking but I want to tell you more than just talking shit on her. Good luck. ‚ù§Ô∏è message me if you need anything."
