lexapro,fquynta,t3_gktck1,1589666547.0,If I didn’t have scary side effects I would love to be on it. I’m willing to try again just with a much lower dose like start with 1.5 and then up by .5 every week until 2.5 and just stay on that until I feel it’s necessary to go up if I do. I have anxiety depression bpd and add. I need a therapist though for sure that’s the next step because I agree starting medicine without therapy doesn’t actually cure you. Happy for you 💙 this inspired me to try to take it again.

BPD,fphi4ak,t1_fphhqd9,1588621683.0,Thank you for saying that lol. I agree. My parents never got me help even though I desperately needed it until I was 20 or 21 and I finally got help. I’m always so afraid on taking medicine because I am so paranoid over everything so that’s also the dilemma. Thank you. I think I’ll try that.
BPD,fphge5j,t1_fphdbgt,1588620817.0,I understand but my eyes were huge it felt like I was having a bad come up on Molly. I felt calm probably because my body was going through so much therefore I was not thinking of anything else besides surviving and feeling these side effects. I was starting to feel better also the previous day bc I started yoga. I’m thinking of getting on Lexapro because my body knows it from before. Thanks for talking to me even though it felt kind of harsh lol. I’m just worried about taking medicine because of future withdrawal but I know I need help and to combine it with therapy. 💙

lakeland,fodcumx,t1_fobw790,1587683082.0,I have so many photos and videos I’m not sure how to send you through reddit but you can message me! It’s a female I’m almost positive as it seems like she is in heat right now. I’m not sure about being around other pets and it will take her just a little while to warm up to you and feel safe but she adapts so quick in the right environment. She interacts well with my hamster but I’m not sure about anything that isn’t caged. She might be about six months I’m not sure at all I haven’t taken her in!! She is long but still such a kitten lol. She’s so cute and wants love she just has to trust you first and feel safe and knows you will continue to feed her. She has had trauma for sure and is constantly rubbing on my feet and now is okay with petting and she speaks a lot to me and is very vocal and a quick learner. It’s going to be hard to let her go seriously but it would be best for her to go to a home that is allowed to have pets and isn’t allergic and wants a long term commitment!

I know diet has a lot to do with it also but I just wanted to hear some words of yours about it. ❤️
helpme,fn18816,t3_fyot5s,1586556739.0,I’m so sorry. That is not okay. I’m sure he remembers as he is older and it would only make sense for you to not remember if anything. I would seek out for a therapist and confiding in a close friend if you have any.  I would definitely keep my distance from him and don’t feel obligated to go around them or him for any reason until you are feeling better. You don’t have to feel obligated to feel any certain way. That is painful and traumatizing. I’m sorry. You are NOT overreacting. Write this on r/twoxchromosomes for some beautiful female support.

abuse,fn0kxjg,t3_fyhrw1,1586543837.0,"try looking up things about BPD (borderline personality disorder) and how you can help as a partner and to understand her better. I’m not saying she is in the right, and I know you need security and love and just care about what’s right, but your partner is having this meltdown so easily from past trauma and it’s most likely beyond her control. I can relate to these acts of hers, like her responses and explosions and I have borderline traits and insane anxiety and depression and ocd. I just know that sometimes even though I’m causing more harm than good and say things so meanly and seriously, it’s out of my control and it’s scary. Substance abuse is a huge concept in personality disorders or being empathetic because you feel too much. Maybe you’ve hurt her in the past and she is still hurt or hates herself for some reasons or maybe just hasn’t acknowledged what’s fucked her over in life and is destroying her health and baby’s wellbeing and losing her shit. It’s shitty and that makes me feel angry knowing she is drinking but I want to tell you more than just talking shit on her. Good luck. ❤️ message me if you need anything."
