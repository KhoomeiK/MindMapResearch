i felt like such a failure and financial drain. i felt stuck and didn't know how to tell my parents i wasn't going to classes and that i was sexually asssaulted. i was suicidal and numb at the same time. the best choice i ever made was to call my mom and tell her everything. i told her what was going on and, even though i dreaded the conversation, she completely supported me and asked if i wanted to come home. 

life can get really hard sometimes and it may seem like you're alone, or a failure, but you never are. everyone goes through things and in most cases, the people closest to you will bend over backwards to help you. good luck with everything and if you ever need to chat, feel free to pm me!"
