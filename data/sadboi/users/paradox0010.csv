digipen,fqkces7,t1_fqgqnbw,1589424410.0,I kinda figured lol. My states lockdown is extended to the end of the month. I’m trying to push my enrollment to 2021 instead. I look forward to seeing Redmond! It sounds lovely. 😄
digipen,fqkc8p3,t1_fqf39es,1589424314.0,"Lol I figured. Mine just got extended again. I already am trying to get my enrollment in 2021 instead, especially since I didn’t expect to get accepted this year."
digipen,fqkc3jk,t1_fqg93u5,1589424231.0,Thank you so much for all this info! I did check safety stats and I assure you it’ll be ten times better than where I am right now. I’ll definitely be keeping all of this in mind.
offmychest,fqf0sy1,t1_fq3nihd,1589316811.0,True true.
offmychest,fq39lob,t1_fq38qct,1589064287.0,"I did, and hopefully I’ll hear something soon. But it’s also a matter of me having to move states. That’s the real issue cuz I don’t know any one over there to stay with. The closest people live 4 hours away. I guess that’s what scares me"
SuicideWatch,fo3h92i,t3_g5ejp3,1587486871.0,"I know this isn’t what you’d like to hear but you can talk to me about anything and I will listen. I can give you advice but know it won’t be pathetic as the ones you said. I’ve been through some shit. I know people that have been through some shit. I know better than to brush them off. If you trust me on that, you as well as anyone who needs someone to listen to them can dm me. I know I’m some rando on the internet, but really. Anything without judgement or distain. 

Hang in there 💕"

starbucks,fjd9fo1,t3_fco0qs,1583248632.0,This reminds me of a coworker who after just saying: “if I have to make one more $;&(/@& pink drink I’m done” and immediately getting three orders for pink drinks

SuicideWatch,fcm6igu,t1_fckfusz,1577765502.0,Idek dude
SuicideWatch,fbsv7qh,t3_e46fmp,1577061170.0,My parents intentionally kept me off of meds and out of a real therapist even after I told them I was suicidal and self harming.  I didn’t even tell them I have PTSD.
SuicideWatch,fbsukbz,t1_fbq8o5x,1577060790.0,We all care. I’ve been in your situation before. We all have. We know the pain even if we haven’t been thru the exact circumstances as you. Please. For our sake. We want you here.
SuicideWatch,fbsu1ot,t3_ee66b1,1577060532.0,"Yes. Incredibly. I have bad paranoia about my family, friends and bf tho which can take a toll of its own. Idk if I can offer to talk with you, but if you ever need to talk lmk."
Cringetopia,f9liu0w,t1_f9li85v,1575424160.0,"I’m not saying that, there’s no way anyone can agree completely. It’s the idea that we all agree, but we seem to have a lot of different ways of getting to it."
Cringetopia,f9l64g4,t1_f9l5pho,1575415343.0,"Exactly it’s just strange to me. The idea of feminism is to be equal in regards to men, not overpowering or belittling them through almost desperate measures."
Cringetopia,f9kwbyd,t1_f9ktgyg,1575409186.0,Yeah I know I was making an example. Any woman in my life who doesn’t agree with feminism I’ll bring up women’s suffrage.
Cringetopia,f9jzxk9,t3_e5gnuh,1575389728.0,this is a perfect example of how fucked up the movement has gotten. im happy as a woman that i am able to have more privilges than 20-30 years ago but damn. we really got to do this?
