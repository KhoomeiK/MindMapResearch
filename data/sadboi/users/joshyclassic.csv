Psychosis,flm0enj,t3_fpnl39,1585271693.0,"All a know about it  is psychotic depression is a thing. Basically being so depressed or uniquely depressed can lead to symptoms of psychosis. As MDD i think stands for major depression, but could be minor also. Since psychosis and depression are treated differently i would assume multiple medications. At least in the beginning"
SuicideWatch,flg0wnw,t1_fl90dhp,1585125836.0,"Its not all its cracked up to be, just imagine actually saying ""ok im going to jump through this window"" the moment you start running is the point of no return. Its less of a conscious decision than you would think. This coming from someone who has tried and failed on 3 occasions in a mental institution. Each time was more frightening because i think your body starts to realise you dont want it. Most suicide options are quick or decisive. No one tortures themselves to death. My point is i dont think anyone who actually goes through with the act is really thinking about whether they are a bitch or not in the moment. Scared people and brave people have both done it. Hope you are doing well my friend"

The only thing that did me any good was the meds she prescribed me, so in that regard it makes sense to keep going. It wont happen overnight but anti-psychotic medication and antidepressants helped me and eventually didnt need the former at all. Apparently 6 months to a year is an average amount of time it takes to recover from a psychotic episode, but everyones different. Some it may take a month, or many years."
