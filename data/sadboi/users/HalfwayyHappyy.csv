You've made it pretty clear to him you'd appreciate the honesty and that he could be honest but he just isn't. My ex lied about big and small things just like that, consistently. Some of the things were so silly, things that had nothing to do with our relationship that he would lie about anyway. If he's a pathological liar, he will just continue to do it. He doesn't seem to respect you wanting honesty in your relationship. Either way, I do hope it works out! <3"

comphet,fhiuadt,t3_f3b1he,1581631965.0,"I definitely know what you mean with all of this from the Twilight crush, to basically faking your way through crushes on guys and all that. The term ""gold star lesbian"" really irks me as I don't think lesbians who HAVEN'T slept with men are any more valid than lesbians who have. It can take time. Some people are late bloomers, others not. Some know early on, some only suspect, and some don't figure out until they're married to a man and have children. You shouldn't let that deter you. I definitely don't think you're faking your sexuality. I used to worry about that, worry about not being ""lesbian"" enough (still worry about things like this and question myself, tbh) because I've had two longterm relationships with guys but really it doesn't invalidate your feelings towards women or lack thereof for men. It's just a process. Especially depending on how you grew up, what influences there were. Plus not having a lot of gay friends or family as a child, I think it makes you more likely to try to be straight even if you're doubting that you are just because that's the ""norm"". It's nice to be able to relate though :) Thank you for sharing this, really."

Also, does the skin being bumpy/picked at make you chew at it more? If that's the case could you try putting on a good moisturizer at night to help them heal with gloves over top? Maybe if the skin healed some, you'd be less tempted to chew. I know I do that to my lips and cuticles when I'm anxious and sometimes even if the skin is fine, I'll pick at it depending on my anxiety level. But having the skin smooth and healed up seems to help me be less inclined to bite and pick. Same with my cuticles. Just a suggestion!"
demisexuality,fhimea6,t3_f3bzkd,1581627575.0,"Asexuality seems to be a very large spectrum, some asexuals being sex-repulsed and some not so much. I assume demisexuality can be similar in that sense. You can definitely be gay and demisexual. Demisexuality as other people have said is about being primarily sexually attracted to people you have an emotional connection with. Asexuality is a large spectrum. It can be a lengthy process of trying to figure it out. It sounds as though you're on that spectrum. Wherever you fit in is perfectly fine!"

You might like both, neither, or everyone. It just depends. You shouldn't punish yourself for it. I used to self harm too, for different reasons. Please don't hurt yourself, I know that's easier said than done. 

If you know where it'll go with her and you aren't ready for that, you can by all means set boundaries with her or just let her know where you're at with this. 

You can't force yourself too much out of your comfort zone so listen to yourself. Set boundaries. Go slow. But isolating yourself from everyone is unlikely to help either. If you still want to hang out with her as friends, set boundaries. If you don't, just let her know. 

Just please don't hurt yourself."

ehlersdanlos,f83yt7i,t3_dyv26l,1574224858.0,This winter when I get symptomatic I find myself throwing open the patio sliding door and standing in front of it or opening the window in the car with the heat running on the rest of my body with my head partly out the window. Lots and lots of sports drinks. Also I generally have one coke every day or every other day. Sometimes it feels like it helps. Sorry I commented a ton of stuff 😭
ehlersdanlos,f83ylr2,t3_dyv26l,1574224671.0,"I've had it since I was about 14 then it got worse at 17 and now I'm 21. When it got worse the first thing I noticed was how eating gave me tachycardia. It was so uncomfortable and still gets uncomfortable. Even now if I eat too much I gotta lay down or sit a long time and let my food digest. Went up to 136 at the doctor like 20 minutes after I ate and had to wait it out. Sucked. Then that my hands and feet would swell and hurt and feel hot sometimes. Overheating was easy to do. Having to lie down on floors in public when I'd get symptomatic. Nauseous with overheating. Poor temp control, too hot or cold. Developed hyperhidrosis so A LOT OF SWEATING. I get very fight or flighty with my adrenaline surges so for years they told me I was just anxious. Got diagnosed by an endocrinologist with a poor mans tilt table . It's taken a toll on me and being able to go places like the mall or out shopping without lots of rest stops and throwing water on my face. Just today I got symptomatic at the doctors office and had to throw cold water on my face, arms, stomach and sit on the floor because it was cold while chugging a body armor. Flare ups are like..oof. Tachycardia, sweating, shaking sometimes, feeling ill and clammy, lightheartedness, feeling like I just wanna jump out of my shoes and run. I get panicky fast."

ehlersdanlos,f7mov2l,t1_f7mok1b,1573869345.0,"No they told me they're not worried about it based on my symptoms. I popped something in my neck maybe 6 days ago. Tense muscles, couldnt move my head to the side because my muscles hurt. Ever since I've had tingling in my neck, shoulders, face and back with occipital pain that sometimes shoots up the sides of my head. But it switches sides depending on how I lean and it's not constant. I mean if I lay down and take the pressure off it gets better as does just generally shifting positions. I've been trying not to worry. The er doctor told me shes definitely not worried about that so I took her word but it still freaks me out."

relationship_advice,f25gnvt,t3_dc23eh,1569974053.0,"Staying friends after a breakup can be really difficult to do if it was a one-sided breakup or a bad relationship. If one of the people still has feelings and it wasnt a mutual ending - friendships just make it take longer to move on from in my opinion. I think whether you tell her why you stopped speaking to her or not is up to you but it sounds like you're making the right decision for yourself by not continuing the friendship. Also consider if telling her why you're no longer speaking to her would cause her to beg you to stay or try to convince you to change your mind. Might be more heartache than what it's worth. Either way, I hope you're doing well!"
DiagnoseMe,f1dmc37,t3_d8vkkp,1569389542.0,"NAD but it kinda sounds like Orthostatic hypotension, that thing that happens from standing up too fast. Sounds like you couldve passed out, especially if it improved once you sat down. Also not eating all day long can add to light headedness and fainting. But I am by no means a doctor. I havent heard of that causing lips to turn blue but I know it can drain color. If you feel completely better, getting checked out by your regular doc would still be a good idea (if you still feel like that or are having other emergency symptoms, you should go to the ER). Hope all is well!"

birthcontrol,ewfdkcj,t1_ewf6bhp,1565358225.0,I just checked in my medication reminder app and it seems I took the pills for 3 to 6 months. I'm not 100% sure when I stopped because I may have stopped the pills before I archived them in the app. It definitely took being consistent for the bleeding to regulate. Seems like a hassle but honestly it was worth it for me. I'd say be patient and consistent but if it doesn't work out or start to get better after some consistency - let your doctor know and discuss other options!
relationships,ewe1ehd,t3_cnuuq2,1565312232.0,I may not have the most helpful advice but I've been through similar situations. He kept telling me he didnt deserve me and didnt love me as much as I loved him and in the end I had to decide to love myself enough to leave. It hurt for a while and it took time but for me being alone was less exhausting and heartbreaking than begging for someone to love me when they just didnt. You sound absolutely wonderful and I'm sorry you're going through this but it will be okay. You deserve someone who knows they love you and they show it.
birthcontrol,et4hsx7,t1_et4h94k,1562450490.0,"The spotting did indeed regulate, I dont remember exactly as it was a few years ago but I think it took one or two months.

birthcontrol,erpqhss,t3_c39em8,1561125496.0,"I'm on my second implant in a row. I love it because i dont have to remember to take pills and being I have migraines, I'm not supposed to take estrogen pills anyways. The first year I had some excessive bleeding problems/prolonged periods but my doctor remedied that with a course of bc pills, once it was fixed I stopped taking those. I'm not sure about other side effects as much because I have a few of my own chronic issues so I wouldnt be comfortable blaming anything (like headaches or weight gain) on the implant as I think the correlation is pretty unlikely. At this point my periods have been very spaced apart for the last maybe 2 out of 4 years. I'd definitely recommend giving it a try and see if it's right for you as you could get it removed if you didnt like it!"
