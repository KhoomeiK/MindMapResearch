BipolarReddit,fqmjufk,t1_fqm78cn,1589478630.0,"Mine is pretty similar. Brain fog, frequently forgetting what I was just about to say, going into a room and not remembering why. My doc dropped my dose down to 200 this week because it was really starting to interfere with my day to day life, so hopefully that helps! I only started taking abilify so I cant speak to any side effects it’s had on my memory."
BipolarReddit,fqkvku1,t3_gjbww1,1589437558.0,"Love Lamictal! Only drawback imo was some memory loss. I was on 300Mgs and recently went down to 200mgs in hopes to combat that. But it really has been the one drug that really kind of got everything on track for me. I’ve only had a few hypo manic spells. I’ve had more downs but they don’t last as long, and are really aided by my anti depressant. It’s worth the wait. Just be patient and hopefully it will impact you positively!"
bipolar2,fqbnocq,t1_fqbkfpy,1589240417.0,That’s good to know! I can definitely use some motivation at this point in my life lol. Just hoping I don’t experience any of the restlessness or weight gain some other people went through 😪
BipolarReddit,fqbgf2k,t1_fqbc16v,1589236496.0,"Ugh okay that makes me feel better. I’m pretty active and trying to get more fit, so I’m also really hoping it doesn’t mess with that. Thanks and good luck!!"
BipolarReddit,fqba455,t1_fqb9rpg,1589233249.0,Thank you!
BipolarReddit,fn81sdu,t3_g03ssl,1586732111.0,"Omg exact same thing happened to me in 2016, 2 years before being diagnosed. It was a stressful 3 month period of mania. For me I think it was brought on by my mom being on hospice & me looking for literally any distraction. I think it’s fair to recognize your fault in it but honestly, when you have mania glasses on it’s like no one and nothing can get through to you. Also like f*ck the guy for going along with it cause he definitely should’ve known better. Anyway, sending lots of love!"
BipolarReddit,fmkizjq,t3_fvhtxv,1586156579.0,"Got diagnosed in 2018, around the same time i started doing EMDR (trauma therapy). Had bought a weed vape and used too much one night and flew into a manic frenzy. Spent all night writing jibberish in my journal and legitimately feeling like I was being possessed and having flashbacks of said trauma. Had experienced other episodes in high school but never connected the two until that point. I still partake in it, just tend to stick to edibles since it’s a more slow burn/relaxed experience for me. Smoking it usually triggers the most anxiety for me, especially if I smoke too much.  Bummer cause the right strains tend to help with my insomnia!"
bipolar2,fhqa2n0,t3_f4aakh,1581801359.0,"Oh god I feel like I cry all the time lol. I’m at 300Mgs but also take Wellbutrin at 150 to help balance out the downs since those are usually my worst. I know adding ability can help too, but my psych wanted to try Wellbutrin first since it’d worked for me in the past."
bipolar2,fhbzlod,t1_fh9nxym,1581453212.0,I like that! Being okay-ish. It’s just hard when you’ve lived your whole life on either end of the spectrum so being in the middle consistently is like 👀
bipolar2,fhbzi9s,t1_fhb4ors,1581453157.0,Oh my god literally my inside narrative lol
bipolar2,fhbzgud,t1_fh9wito,1581453133.0,"My sleep has been amazing too! I never realized how much it helped because even after meds, it’s such a struggle to have a good sleep schedule. So hopefully I can keep it up lol"
ChildrenofDeadParents,ff4fief,t3_eraqho,1579562375.0,"Lost my mom 3 years ago and it still sucks but I promise that sometimes it sucks a little less. Year 1 and 3 were the worst. I see a lot of mom and daughter pairs at my job and it always feels like a kick at my heart. I’m getting married next year and I hate realizing she won’t be there to help me pick my dress or watch me walk down the isle. You’re allowed to feel angry and jealous. Even if it’s temporary relief, it’s better than no relief at all. Sending you lots of love and good vibes"
bipolar2,fecrw0t,t1_febb44o,1578982268.0,I think I just haven’t found the right people to understand where I’m at. I have maybe 1 or 2 people that have been around for a while but I’m always so paranoid about”ruining” things even more by making ANOTHER plan that I’ll end up bailing on the night of. I guess I just need to have my faith in myself and them
bipolar2,fecrr8m,t1_feckk6s,1578982134.0,That’s so sweet your SO helps out! Mine is a bit of a happy hermit herself so she’s not the best at socializing but I think having her keep me accountable may actually help. It’s just so hard treading the line between being “honest” with someone about what’s going on and not recognizing it at all. I’ve come to terms with my diagnoses but I think I still worry about what people may think when they hear about my mental illness esp since Bipolar still has a negative stigma around it *sigh*
bipolar2,fecrkev,t1_fec7wrd,1578981939.0,"Okay this is like the best thing I couldve read right now. Grief f*cking SUCKs! And that in addition to crazy mood swings really doesn’t help. Thanks for sharing, and you’re totally right. We do deserve love and friendship! I just gotta keep trying and wait it out for the right ones. Hugs and luck to you too <3"
