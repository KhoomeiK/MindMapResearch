depression,fao0p2m,t3_e9v975,1576254886.0,My parents are supportive . But society in general does not know because I agree that once you come out as depressed you are not a part of the normal population in uni or at work or in family occasions. People just don't care and personally I don't blame them. But it is upsetting that people aren't treating it like it can lead to suicide.

depression,fagfl4d,t3_e8xd2o,1576052294.0,When I was depressed. Thc helped me a lot when medicine failed. I know it might not be sustainable outside some European countries and the US but if u can access it legally I'd give it a go. Be careful if you have panic disorder or severe anxiety. It can exxasserbate anxiety if u smoke the wrong stuff.

depression,f8ogtoq,t1_f892oux,1574680276.0,"thank you, i might be a narcissist . my older brother is one too and he too is very successful . I am also bad in relationships, i always lose interest in my partner, even a girl i was crushing on for like 10 years and finally got to be with because i was attractive to her eventually for some reason. but i never feel wrong and so i do think u might be right about narcissism and i feel like you are right about me having a mix of mental issues . but i am not fully a narcissist because as much as i love feeling like i am right, i do still know and accept and admit that i am wrong and take the L so to speak. i dunno. i logged into reddit just to post this and ive had the account for a while. when you say you relate do you relate to my confusion about my mentality or do you also relate to my symptoms?"

depression,f88zcvt,t3_dznvug,1574364227.0,"i have a woman that is madly in love with me, and I WAS in love with her for years , but depression can kill any emotion or just make it useless. i would also think that if i can just find a lover i would be just fine. but that is not always true, i hope you nderstand that you are the reason depression comes and will be the reason it goes. I am still depressed, but i dont let other things or credit other people for my depression. you are way more important to yourself than you think, be selfish, care about yourself more. it can cure depression, and if it doesnt cure it, it can atleast make things clear on what causes what. I could be 100% wrong about you, but I am 100% right about myself. i hope you are too. also dont kill urself its not cool"
depression,f88ybdv,t3_dznyk1,1574363685.0,"i hope you didnt hurt yourself badly. It must have been piling on if you attempted now. just chill and realize that you are still alive and you are going to find the way to get out of this situation. if you hate the town, leave it and never ever return, i was so depressed i took a flight to a different continent and felt much better. it comes and goes. so when it comes, dont try to go , wait for it to go."
