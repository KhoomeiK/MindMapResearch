We drive metal boxes with blinking lights at over 60mph/97kmh. But with our lifespan, everyday is a trial because all we know is what has been taught and what we discover. So knowledge lost must be relearned and documented. We are both a miracle and a tragedy in one form."

depression,erl4ate,t3_c2fuf3,1560977957.0,"I want to tell you that you're right, but it does get much worse if you have major depression as an adult. Imagine wanting to curl up and do nothing, but you have to keep moving in order to keep your house, electricity, and food/water going. And if you say ""public assistance"", I'll say that's one more thing to be depressed about.

Think of it as a reason to get your depression taken care of [find your coping mechanism] while you're still being supported. Plus once you find your coping mechanism, you can build your adult life around it. Maybe not the most sound advice, but it works for me. I found that waking up early made my depression worse, so now I wake up at noon and work evening shift. I might miss some family events, but that's okay because they made it worse too."
depression,eqa2rrr,t1_eq95knv,1559923790.0,Just try to stop thinking so far into the future and think about every detail that you're going through now. Try to use most of your brain power to process the present and you'll have less time to think about the future.

depression,epegjbu,t3_bul2i4,1559182439.0,"That's called life. You have to learn how to cope with these feelings. The smile was her just in a good mood from her day, or remembering the good things with you. The frown was from the last part of your relationship where you broke up and the half hearted smile was her trying to show you that nothing's wrong with how things are/were/how things ended. Don't make her feelings drag your feelings down. 

Just remember, when you're with someone they can be part of your world. But when you break up, their feelings should be separate from your feelings."

But if they left me alone then I got my answer. They ended up leaving me, which is honestly better imo, less wet eyes when I finally pull the trigger."
depression,eoon498,t1_eoohihm,1558742729.0,"This is beautiful. I love every part of this as I try to tell the same message to everyone I come across with depression. If you're unhappy with anything in your life, you can change it by starting with yourself. Understandably, chemical imbalances will hold you back or delay the process, but once you change *the chemicals you put into your body* you'll start to notice a difference. Diet can influence you just as much as medication, and if you don't understand that, then you're ignorant about how life works. Look at yourself deeply and understand the world before you go to give up. Sure the whole thing is pointless at the end of the day, but we will all reach our expiration date eventually. Enjoy what you can and do the most to be happy because time will take everything from you. *anything and everything you come in contact with is a form of a chemical compound* 

Hope this opens up a few eyes."
depression,eokkjt4,t3_bs9kpn,1558656786.0,"Crazy to think that other people think the same way that you do. Why not think of it as a weight lifted? For example, I don't care to make an embarrassment of myself any longer because at the end nobody will care."
depression,eokjp77,t3_bs1328,1558656218.0,"As someone who battled with weight, this speaks to me. But this is where you have to take the little bit of hope and stretch it for yourself. You can change anything about yourself that you want to with enough will, minus a few things. Even if you're depressed, the amount of will that's kept you alive to read this is enough. 

Weight is a tough issue and honestly I resorted to tolerable fasting. Just by cutting down on how much I ate in a day made a difference long term. Even a change of diet will help, but don't try to go from 0-100 or else you'll damage yourself. But if you say you can't do it, then what's the point of complaining? It's a battle of self-will vs. the things that make you depressed. And if that pisses you off, then use that anger to start because that just means you either fear the change that will better yourself or you don't understand what I was saying in the first place and you need to re-read.

Understandably though, your weight gain may be caused by genetics. That's a tough one, but why not turn your self-loathing into helping? Become a Bio-geneticist and look to assist yourself or create new research into weight control at a genetic level. You're only restricted by what you *think* you can't do."
depression,eokhnpg,t1_eojwshb,1558654864.0,"It's ironic that depression can help with anxiety. I found this to be my case as well. By knowing that it can end any minute, I've found more strength to accomplish tasks I otherwise couldn't or wouldn't do."
