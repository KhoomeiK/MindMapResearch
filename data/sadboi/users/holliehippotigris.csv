I previously have lived in a group home and one of the workers was inpatient with me as a patient and it actually made me feel better about them. They were very upset when they saw me on the unit and stayed in their room the rest of the day. When they came out for a meal I went over and told them that everything that happens on the unit is confidential in my eyes and that I would not tell any of the other patients at the group home or his coworkers about seeing him. And that the fact that he came in and got help instead of hurting himself in some way made me have more respect for him and trust him more in treating me because I knew he understood and  knew how hard it was to have mental illness. After that he was fine with being on the unit with me and actually went to groups. We talked about it and were able to set up and maintain boundaries once back at the home. 

I know thats not possible with all patients (boundaries) but being hospitalized isn't necessarily a career ender and should have absolutely no affect on licensing or someone's job in mental health.
