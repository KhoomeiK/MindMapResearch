the t shirt was on the tighter side, i mean it wasn't tight just very well fitting so if you want it to be a bit bigger/baggier i would say get a size up.

the hoodie fit me perfectly. 

but i don't know, i don't work in small, medium and large measurements.

i wouldn't go off me, its a big commitment with the money and ordering etc... so ask someone else or the internet. sorry...
