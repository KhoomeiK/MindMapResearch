AskWomen,fos6uyr,t1_forzrsb,1588025035.0,Came here to say this one. Fate. Not coincidence.
AskWomen,fobvsy5,t3_g6hkcx,1587664219.0,That my mom died when I was 36. I would tell that hormonal brat to enjoy every moment she gets with her mom.
AmItheAsshole,fo05agm,t3_g4saq8,1587406327.0,"NTA. Sounds like he’s super insecure. You’re doing what you can to better yourself and your health, and he is sabotaging it. He should be supporting you in your efforts, and instead he is focusing on how your health and weight-loss makes him feel insufficient. Don’t allow him to make this about him, and don’t you dare stop taking care of you for his sake. He doesn’t seem to care about what’s best for you, so much so that he thinks you have some kind of “agenda”. So not ok."
Divorce,fnwmeim,t1_fnvvq6n,1587321165.0,"Came here to say this. My ex had tons of personal debts, into the hundred thousands, that OUR money went to paying off. I was never allowed to spend money on anything for myself because it all had to go toward getting “us” out of debt. Found out later he was cheating me on the whole time, and when we got divorced, all his personal debts went with him. Bye, ya bitch."
Anxiety,fnurcfl,t3_g3z40y,1587269084.0,I’ve convinced myself at least 6 times now that I have it. It’s definitely not just you.
relationships,fnur0hx,t3_g3xd2f,1587268849.0,"I was 32 when I found out my ex was cheating on me. We were trying for baby #2 and had just put an offer on a house. None of that happened and I thank God I found out when I did. It’s hard sharing my daughter with him, but I can only imagine how much more complicated it all could’ve been. Take the time you need to grieve. It took me years to get to the place where I am now, but it is possible to move on, rediscover yourself, and eventually find love again. Only good things for you, OP."
relationship_advice,fmbv46x,t3_fu7b20,1585933772.0,Personally I feel splitting a McDonalds bill as taking too far. Eventually those kids will become aware of this bill splitting. It would scream to me that you don’t care about me enough to cover the cost of my burger. I’d never want to put the kids in a situation where they feel uncared for. Covering them for meals and other basic needs is a way of showing you care and love them. Let their dad and your gf financially handle the big stuff. You and your girlfriend should be able to handle the small stuff.

AskReddit,fl17igk,t1_fl16rpq,1584723508.0,I get that. Sounds like she’s scared. I honestly don’t blame her.
AskReddit,fl17c6a,t3_flt20t,1584723412.0,"My anxiety. Anytime I cough I think I’m dying, and by default so is the rest of my family. Anytime my kid coughs I think she’s dying, and by default so is the rest of the family. I’m scared to leave the house. We have enough food to last maybe the week. Then what? Go to the grocery store that will be sold out of everything we need,  just to get sneezed on by someone, which will likely result in all of us dying. Oh, and I’m 3 months pregnant and can’t take Xanax. So that’s where I’m at."
AskReddit,fl168nz,t1_fl0cymh,1584722802.0,"Sorry but she’s right to have you not leave the house. This thing is crazy contagious. In my area, the people dying aren’t just the elderly. The majority have been adults in their 40’s and 50’s. I’d rather be stuck at home cleaning with my mom than go out and run the risk of infecting myself and my family."
relationship_advice,fkihroj,t3_fiowwe,1584220307.0,You’re taking this extraordinarily well.
AskReddit,fh1qmc4,t3_f0xd5p,1581221358.0,Not even a little bit. Creeped out just thinking who might be on there.
DunderMifflin,fh1b8q5,t1_fgzobws,1581213031.0,I also enjoy the Garden Party and a couple of the episodes in Florida. But I was not a fan of the Erin / Andy storyline for the rest of the series.
DunderMifflin,fgz5dy3,t1_fgyuwaj,1581190895.0,You’re right. Definitely a great scene. Then the opening credits rolled and the funny stopped shortly after.
DunderMifflin,fgxg8fw,t3_f0or5k,1581172442.0,Nice sentiment. Too bad it was the worst.
DunderMifflin,fgxg5p7,t3_f0rvz1,1581172408.0,"I’ve actually grown to love Robert California. I liked season 8 better than the last couple episodes of season 7. Those are not good, especially the ones with Will Ferrell."
whitepeoplegifs,fgpfzhl,t3_ez32to,1581004047.0,Can I please unsubscribe from the reality show?
AmItheAsshole,f3hvauc,t3_dgz2ph,1570928951.0,"NTA. Not for nothing, but if she hadn’t been taking her birth control for awhile, she was probably looking for an “accident” long before the actual night the baby was conceived."
