explainlikeimfive,fpirdmz,t1_fphu2sm,1588647010.0,"This is the real answer. 

I’d like to add that in a lot of ways TVs and Monitors feel like they swapped with each other in the last decade. Monitors used to offer cutting edge technology. Now they only excel in response time. TVs on the other hand are coming out with all sorts of features and tech by the year that are either lacking or not even available on even the most expensive monitors. 

Wide colour gamut is still missing in many monitors. HDR colour gamut when included is usually not as great as TVs as well.  No local dimming. Shitty contrast ratios and horrible black uniformity. Panel types aren’t progressing either. VA used to look so promising. It’s been largely the same for a long time. OLED didn’t make it onto a monitor until 10 years after the first OLED TV."
GameStop,fpcsagz,t1_fpaiczp,1588511285.0,"Not at all. I’d actually say this has been common since the beginning of online shopping. Ordering online affords you the time to shop around. When it just started becoming popular I remember thinking you could get most things cheaper online if you knew where to look or took the time to. 

I think it’s remained the same and only gotten worse for some people. Even though most games especially at launch are the same price among vendors. You now have so many different vendors to check through before buying unlike before. So many things to consider when you’re ordering something you won’t have immediately as opposed to just buying it and never thinking passed that. 

Is there a bonus for going with one shop over the other? Will the game be cheaper in a month from now or is it one that never goes on sale like Nintendo games? What about key resellers? Digital or physical? Will Honey work? All questions you could ask yourself and actually have time to look up comfortably as opposed to in store."

By the end of it I knew they didn’t give two shits about minimizing the cost to the student. It was even more damning that these major changes they made were not even implemented tactfully.

As for free games you’re gunna find free games just as easily and of higher quality as well through PC and once again, more frequently. Because right now other platforms are trying to pull users off of steam and onto their platforms. For example the Epic Games Store. I haven’t bought one game from them but in the last year I have accumulated over 40 titles I got for free from them. Games like Inside, Celeste, Everything, Hollow Knight, Slime Rancher.

You need look no further than at this month’s Humble Bundle for an example. 12$ for 3 decent titles upfront then 4-6 more at the end of the month. Yakuza Kiwami alone is 20$ on the playstation store.  ‘On average’ is being generous since personally I can always find games cheaper on PC than console.

If they pick the controller up twice a year I don’t see how that qualifies a stat like this either.

This has nothing to do with gender politics. When people use the term gamers they’re talking about people who frequently play a variety of games in a variety of genres. That’s a distinction that’s important from casuals which are people who play only one game or one type of game only or play games with great infrequency. You wouldn’t call yourself a cinaphile cause you watched every Avengers movie. It’s the same concept. I don’t know why this community can’t or refuses to accept this. If you just play Clash of Clans exclusively then Im sorry you’re not a gamer."

It is not ‘usually’ treated this way unless it is acute and there is reason to suspect pressure is building quickly and will continue to build. Some people experience this chronically and there are less invasive methods to control the onset.

For example I mentioned in another comment you can get compartment syndrome from sitting too long. The treatment would not be a fasciotomy, it would be to get up and move around if possible before going that far."
nononono,f85w0pg,t1_f85td1j,1574284383.0,"Well that mechanism of injury sounds very brief. I’d say they were correct in their diagnosis or belief that this was compartment syndrome in your case. 

I would guess that after being run over your foot began to swell and fill with so much fluid it filled the space between what’s called the fascia (connective tissue that you can think of as a layer over the muscle that connects it to the bone, skin and anything else around jt for stabilization) and the muscle. This is the ‘compartment’ and you will find them all over the body. What happens if this goes on unchecked is basically the same as with crush syndrome although it’s more nuanced than this.  

The difference to understand is the process that makes it happen is more because the build up of pressure from the increased fluid rather than a lack of sustenance (Oxygen) to the muscle as is seen with crush syndrome. 

I hope that makes sense and I hope you recovered well!"

MGS popularized the stealth genre. Carving a path for many beloved stealth games and honestly MGS is the best of them still. 

No mecca game matches Zone of the enders to this day. Period. 

PT influenced a wave of clearly inspired horror games including RE 7. There is a direct correlation with when this was released and the setting horror games decided to take on after it. 

Snatcher although not commercially successful is considered one of the best adventure games of all time. 

He somehow made an apparent walking simulator more engaging, interesting and polarizing than any actual walking simulator has ever been. 

All his games contain unique elements and themes not seen in any other game. And he has done this with unmatched consistency. Pretty much every one of his games even titles succeeding the original in a series manage to introduce something actually new and not seen before each fucking time. 

Themes. The theme informs everything in his games. Making for some of the most interesting moments in gaming history. 

If he isn’t high tier then nothing is and gaming is dead to you. You may as well give it up at this point if you can’t see that he is in fact, based on his track record, one of the greatest there is. It’s irrefutable and I notice a trend in people like you who claim he is a hack or just trying to be artsy for arts sake. Saying just that and having absolutely nothing else to say that stands up against the mountain that is his body of work. And usually when I talk this way about him I get DVs but no one has shit to say back other than he’s full of himself. And I don’t disagree but that doesn’t make him average. If what he makes is average then wtf are all these AAA games coming out half finished?"

gaming,f7g30x6,t1_f7fkcwx,1573693260.0,"There are a few key things to know about the social strand system. 

Obviously it’d be ridiculous to be able to see every structure built and every item left behind by every player. So instead what you do see is best described as a small cluster of things at any one time. 

What other players add in their world has a chance to show up in your world to a point. This is true for things built by you as well. 

You can like other players structures. The amount of likes they get influence the structures likely presence in other players games and the structures staying power. 

If you notice a player who builds lots of useful things or seems to be constructing a lot in the same area as you. You may enter a contract with them. This guarantees you’ll see their structures more often and visa versa. 

Some structures require large amounts of materials of which you won’t be able to transport all at once to the structure. With the social system players can help contribute to the building of this structure bit by bit. Usually this means anything like a road or other structure with massive material needs will usually have the work cut in half by the time you see it thanks to other player contributions. Or it may already be built. These types of structures are the most useful so the chances you’ll come across many completed ones are high since they also garner the most likes. 

To directly answer your question. It will definitely vary from the day one players in the fact that there are now more large structures being established by more players. The day ones never had this but everyone after that is pretty much experiencing the benefit of the hard work of other players. If that’s concerning you can also disable it but honestly why would you unless you’re a masochist. Just think of it as a dynamic evolving map based on popularity."

If anyone is reading this and on the fence about the game. I’d say wait it out for a future sale. That way it doesn’t feel as bad if it turns out the game wasn’t to your liking. But I definitely feel it’s a game worth at least trying. Also don’t listen to the people who say the story is classic Kojima senselessness. They clearly haven’t played or weren’t paying attention.
