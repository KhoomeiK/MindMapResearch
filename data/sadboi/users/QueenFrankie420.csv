On top of that you can get all the way to a 3 day suspension and if you manage to go 6 months without fucking up again, it starts all over.

The origins of this misinformation started when ""chainmail"" in the actual mail was a thing. Someone wanted to see how far and fast misinformation could spread and sent out a leaflet of some true facts mixed with some completely false facts to see if people would believe it, share it, send it on. The fact that it still persists today with the internet and plenty of facts and sites that flat out dispute it with truth proves a lot about people.

Reasons a spider would likely not enter your mouth. Spiders don't like damp places, so intentionally entering your damp mouth or nose is unlikely. The air movement would be different from the rest of the room, indicating to most spiders that it's not safe, as if the damp wasn't already deterring them. Most of the time spiders would crawl into your mouth, rather than your nose, and if your mouth is open while you're sleeping odds are higher that you're snoring, making a vibration and a noise. So if on the off chance a spider has no sense of self preservation, you might have a risk of eating a spider in your sleep. But most spiders are smarter than that."

The most asshole person I've ever experienced and fucked with on the road was a guy driving a Hummer. He was trying to weave through traffic and I was in the left lane of a 2 lane road. He flew up behind me and I was doing the speed limit. The second he had a chance he got into the right lane and I sped up just enough that he couldn't get in front of me. The left lane was going faster than the right so he pulled back in behind me. I lifted my foot off the gas until I was going the speed limit again. When he thought he had the opportunity to pass me on the right again, I repeated the activity. We did this dance for about 15 miles. Him trying to pass me. Me thwarting him.

todayilearned,foza8ql,t1_foz7yf0,1588187280.0,"I don't think you're doing the math right on that. The average baseline for pregnancy actually only is 38 weeks, not 40. They call it 40 because they count the start of the pregnancy from the first day of your last period even though you don't ovulate until about 2 weeks later. They do that typically because it's easier than calculating the actual conception date. In line with that, that's also the big reason why the timeline can fluctuate. Some people ovulate 10 days after. Some don't ovulate until 20 days after. The only really predictable factor when it comes to periods is that they always happen 12-15 days after ovulation occurs if implantation doesn't occur. If a pregnancy continues beyond 42 weeks they typically induce or do a cesarian.

Even if we did include 42 weeks as the maximum line that's still not ""10 full months"" as you said. A month is 30-31 days excluding the anomaly of February. So 42x7=294 days and 294/30.5=9.64 months. If you go by the actual amount of time spent pregnant which is about 2 weeks less than that, even still going with 42(40) weeks, that is 40x7=280 days and 280/30.5=9.2 months. If you go with the average length of pregnancy which is 40 weeks or in reality about 38 weeks, you wind up with 38x7=266 days and 266/30.5=8.7 months.

None of those is ""10 full months""

There isn't really any such thing. Every person has different things about them that make them who they are. Some people are serious, others are funny. Some people are outgoing, others are shy. Some people are athletic, some are clumsy, some are into SciFi, some are into action, some are into comedy, some are into dogs and others like cats. Some people are Christians, Jewish, Catholic, Hindu, athiest, etc. Some people are Republicans and others are Democrats and some are in between. Can you see how calling yourself ""an average guy"" really tells me nothing about who you are?

Also ""getting with a girl"" doesn't really say a lot about what you are looking for. Are you looking for a casual relationship? Something serious? Just a fuck buddy? 

It's not impossible to do any of these things, generally speaking. You seem to be, from your other replies, stuck in the mentality that it is impossible, but I assure you it truly isn't. It might take more work on your part than you're currently applying, or maybe you're going for the wrong type of girl. Maybe you just need some tips.

First - girls are just like every other person with variations in interests and personalities. We aren't some mystical creature that you can't possibly connect with on any level. Really talking with a person can let you know if you're going to connect with them. Don't try to force it to work if it's obvious that your interests don't mesh. And saying that, you don't have to 100% have the same interests for it to work out. My husband is a republican, gun carrying, computer geek who likes shooting games and going paintballing. I'm a moderate Democrat who enjoys adventure games more than shooting games and I enjoy creating art. We have similar tastes in movie/tv genres, we both enjoy tabletop gaming, we both like camping and hiking, etc. Find a person you get along with enough that you want to spend time with them and look forward to seeing them, and make sure they feel the same. 

Second - girls don't like it when you act creepy. You might think you're not acting creepy, but you might be without realizing how creepy it is to a girl. I've had so many guys in the past think that they aren't being creepy when they were. Repeatedly asking a girl out isn't endearing, it's harassment. Talking for a while then sending an unsolicited dick pic isn't sexy, it's a turn off for most girls. Talking for a long time at a girl, not with a girl, about something you're into isn't a conversation and she's probably looking for a way to escape. And in line with that if she's making up less than 30% of the conversation, you're talking at her, not with her, with very few minor exceptions. If she's not making eye contact with you and she's not facing her body towards you in any way and you're doing the majority of the talking, she's not into it and probably wants you to go away but is too polite to say anything.

Third - you really need to realize that you are young, you have the time to learn and meet people and connect with people. Realize that you're not going to just meet a girl, start talking, and click automatically. My husband and I met over 12 years ago. We didn't start dating until I'd known him and been friends with him for almost 7 years. I'd dated 4 guys in between. He'd dated girls between too. Eventually we would up together and now we've been together almost 6 years and married for almost 1.

Fourth - don't overestimate what you have to offer. Don't think you're a 8/10 when you're really a 6/10. And don't expect to get a pretty perfect girl because quite frankly that doesn't exist. Unless you're accepting of a girl's flaws, you're not going to find what you're looking for.

Basically, look for someone with some shared interests. Don't expect to find them right away. Don't be creepy. And realize not everyone is perfect.

And don't expect to find someone without effort.

I don't know if any of this helps."

Advice,fn547so,t3_fzmusk,1586655531.0,"I disagree with the person who said that water is ""more hydrating"" than soda and tea. 

https://www.nhs.uk/news/food-and-diet/tea-compared-to-water-for-hydration/

""Drinking four to six mugs of tea a day is as good for keeping you hydrated as a litre of water,"" reported the Daily Mail. It said the finding disproves ""the idea that regular tea drinking can dehydrate the body because of its caffeine content"".

Is it possible that you're consuming more fluids than you used to? I've heard varying amounts of water that it is proper to consume, and I'm fairly certain (not scientific or anything) that the most accurate one I've heard is that you should consume 2/3 of your body weight in lbs converted to oz of fluids. So if you weighed 120lbs you'd divide that by 3 (40) then multiply that by 2 (80) then that's how many oz you should drink. Because every person is a different size, this is why I think this is most accurate. A larger, taller person should need more fluids than a shorter smaller person would, just like calories. 8x8oz glasses of water as a blanket just doesn't seem as thorough and also there are plenty of articles online that say it's not.

That amount includes any liquids in your diet, not just water. The real reason people seem to suggest drinking water in place of other beverages typically seems to come from either calories or ""caffeine is a diuretic"" which btw, water is a diuretic too. A diuretic is literally something that causes increased passing of urine, which is exactly what drinking more water does. But really any fluids do this, and the amount from caffeinated beverages vs uncaffeinated beverages vs water is almost negligible. The calorie aspect can be an issue for people who are trying to lose weight or manage their weight, and sugary drinks can also have a poor effect on those who are diabetic.

All this is to say if you feel better drinking water, drink water. If you want to have a cup of tea every now and again it isn't going to make you feel worse, most likely. I'd stay away from too much sugary stuff in general in terms of drinks and food, but don't feel like you can't treat yourself if you'd like. :-)"

WeightLossAdvice,fk9crvs,t3_fh5b9u,1583973420.0,"First off, I think it's awesome that you want to help her out. Have you discussed with her any goals or plans she might already have? Possibly already know this, but you should try to steer clear of anything claiming crazy results in a short time frame (examples like magazines saying lose 20lbs in 20 days) or fad diets, detoxes, etc. Most ""weight loss teas"" are laxatives, diuretics, or both.

You mentioned that you are trying to gain weight at the same time she's trying to lose weight, but there are a few things you both could benefit from. Not keeping junk food in the house is a great thing from a health perspective. It's not nutritionally beneficial to either of you, but you can still have it sometimes as a treat. Keeping a log (and not lying to yourself, really you're only going to hurt yourself if you lie to yourself) of what and how much you eat is beneficial, including tasting things when you cook, snacking, even a ""splash"" of creamer in your coffee can be more than you think. Speaking of ""more than you think"" investing in a decent food scale is something that goes a long way when it comes to realizing how much you're actually consuming. Also regarding the food log, make sure you're getting enough of all your vitamins and macros (protein, carbs, fats). Exercising together is a great motivator. Having someone else to say ""hey, let's get up and go for a walk together!"" can really kick both of you into gear, and it's really good for your health to be active.

A few weight loss tips. Calculate your tdee (total daily energy expenditure) and reduce your calories from that. 1lb of fat is about 3500 calories so if you reduce your tdee 250 calories you'll lose about half a pound a week, 500 reduction is about a pound a week. Don't try to lose more than 1-2lbs a week or you risk being deficient in nutrients you need to function. If you don't like the way a food tastes, play around with spices. Spices are low calorie and can add a lot of flavor. If you're feeling hungry after eating a decent amount, have a glass of water or tea and wait 20 minutes. If you're still hungry, have something healthy like veggies or fruit and maybe some more water or tea. Don't deprive yourself of treats, just fit them into your daily limit. Depriving yourself of things you like tends to backfire. Lift weights or do other weight bearing exercises, because they are good for your muscles and your bones. Muscles burn more calories than fat so you don't want to lose too much with the weight loss. Working them will help keep them from deteriorating.

Keep in mind when you first start on a weight loss journey, you often times will lose a lot at the beginning then it will slow down. This is totally normal, and a lot of the initial weight loss isn't fat loss. It's mostly water weight, waste (poop), and in the case of low carb diets, glycogen stores. It's also sometimes because you have lost weight but haven't adjusted your diet accordingly alongside your weight loss. As you lose weight, your caloric needs decrease as well and you have to adjust your diet/exercise to keep up. It's also 100% normal to eat in a deficit and not see movement on the scale for a few weeks then have a ""whoosh"" of weight loss all at once, it's called the whoosh effect often times online if you want to Google it. So don't lose heart if you don't see the movement on the scale. Use more than one method to measure your weight loss, like measurements and how your clothes fit. I personally measure more than the usual bust, waist, hips. I measure my neck, bust, chest below bust, waist, hips, thighs, calves, upper arms, forearms, and wrists. I realize mine might be overkill, but as an hourglass figured gal I find it to be helpful for me personally.

-walking in place in various ways, side to side stepping, knees lifted as high as they go, varying the pace, turning it into kind of a dance by wiggling my hips some, etc.

WeightLossAdvice,fiocac6,t1_fioc31y,1582580456.0,It's the difference between what you need vs what your consuming.
WeightLossAdvice,fiob7jf,t1_fio7ccz,1582579855.0,"In theory, if your tdee is around 1900 and you eat 1400 that should be enough to lose 1lb of fat per week, yes. Weight loss, as much as I'd love it to be, isn't just a math game though. Also as you lose weight your tdee will go down so you'll have to recalculate. This is a pretty good calculator, imo. http://justcico.com/"
WeightLossAdvice,fio55j3,t3_f8w92v,1582576492.0,"1 lb of fat loss in a week is a 500 calorie deficit a day approximately, keeping in mind that the scale does not only reflect fat loss. BMR stands for basal metabolic rate which is the base amount your body needs to per vital organs and can vary from what online calculators tell you due to various factors like how much muscle vs fat you have (muscle uses more calories than fat) and thyroid function, among other factors. Tdee is total daily energy expenditure and uses a multiplier based on your activity level. As such, online calculators should be used as an estimate, not an absolute. Also if you are eating too few calories your metabolism can drop. The Minnesota experiment calculated a maximum metabolic decrease of 40% in their starvation study amongst participants (an interesting read, you should look it up if you like that kind of thing) which is often referenced when talking about starvation mode as a myth. Additionally unless you are coming and weighing everything you are eating, you may be consuming more calories than you think, especially in the United States but I'm guessing you're from elsewhere since you used kg, because the food companies are allowed to round down amounts of calories in food. One YouTube mathematician I watched a video from calculated in progresso soups that the label indicated up to 40% more calories in the product than the label claimed was in the can. Again, this was in the United States, I'm not totally sure how it works elsewhere. Some studies show working out in the morning vs later on in the day burns more calories for the entire day. You also did not mention gender, but as I'm a female I would be remiss to leave out that hormonal fluctuations play a role in weight loss throughout the menstrual cycle, with some slight weight increases around the time of your period that even out near the end of it. Everything you eat or drink also shows up on the scale. Drink a liter of water, you'll see a a couple lbs increase on the scale equal to the weight of the water. Eat a higher sodium meal, you'll weigh more because your body will hold onto more fluids to compensate for it until it can get the extra sodium out (iirc it takes 6 water molecules to remove 1 sodium molecule from your body). Also if you're following a ketogenic diet and have too many carbs your body will start to store them again and that will be reflected on the scale as weight gain, but it's not fat gain, it's just glycogen stores. Not sure if this helps, but if you'd like to talk more, I'm totally willing to have a longer conversation."

WeightLossAdvice,fignfsv,t3_f7vyxx,1582401710.0,"How tall are you? You should calculate your bmr. What time frame did you lose the 14lbs in? A realistic goal would be 1-2lbs a week. Also as a female, where you're at in your cycle plays a role. The week before my period I notice that I tend to go up a little then it evens out about 3/4 through my period. A good caloric intake for weight loss is about 250-500 calories below your BMR."

WeightLossAdvice,fhj5lz3,t3_f3gfth,1581638550.0,"Your weight can fluctuate up to (I think average) 10lbs (idk metric, sorry) in a day due to what you eat and drink, so I wouldn't beat yourself up over it. Give it a few days and weight check should balance itself out. Like if you are x weight in the morning then drink coffee or water or whatever you're going to weigh what you weighed in the morning plus the weight of the coffee. Having a one off day isn't going to kill your progress as long as you don't let it become a daily habit to have days like that. I know so well how much the scale can be your best friend one day and your enemy the next. I don't know what kind of diet/meal plan you were following before but also if you were on keto and ate a bunch of carbs your body is going to hold on to that glucose for a couple days. Glucose is stored in your muscles in the form of glycogen so that you can use it in reserve in case of starvation, so any glucose (carbs are turned into glucose by your body) will be there until you flush it out. Also pizza has a lot of sodium which also causes your body to retain water. Iirc it takes 6 water molecules to carry out one sodium molecule so drink a bunch of water, continue doing good on your diet plan, and you'll see some results in a few days."

Try to avoid saying things like ""I'm not interested *right now*"" or ""I'm not looking to start dating *at the moment*"" because those can be seen as ""maybe someday in the future I can try again"" but at the same time make sure you're speaking to them in an age appropriate way.

Advice,fg50jtn,t3_ewwpqw,1580515334.0,"Honestly, nobody here can tell you if you're depressed because we're (mostly) not mental health professionals and (more importantly) nobody here is *your* doctor.

That being said, aside from losing interest in social media, have you lost interest in other things that you used to enjoy doing? Like if you used to go hiking, playing video games, making crafts, etc, do you not enjoy doing that anymore? Those types of things are more indicative of depression than the realization that social media is kind of attention whoring at it's worst. 

Also an indication of depression is significant weight loss or gain *without trying* but that also can be related to stresses. Appetite changes normally anyway, but significant would be like 20lbs +/- in a month.

The other person recommended a therapist, which is a good idea for some people. You can bounce ideas off of a professional and whether you're depressed or not it can help to just have someone else's input. Therapy isn't for everyone, and it's ok if you get a therapist and it doesn't work out for you. Sometimes you don't mesh with that therapist and need to try someone else. Sometimes therapy doesn't help at all.

I wish you the best of luck."

TalesFromRetail,fdzn7us,t1_fdyd5dj,1578791972.0,"My husband and I went to go see the new Star Wars movie on Sunday and everything there was automated unless you were paying cash. We went to buy tickets, 1 employee and like 6 screens for passing with a card. They have a rewards program and when my husband went to put in his info to pull it up, because they don't have an actual physical card, it said it didn't exist. We called the one employee over to get help with it and while he was trying to help us the couple next to us asked him a question and he just stopped helping us and helped them. Then when we went to get concessions it was the same story. They had a bunch of screens you ordered from, paid at, then got a number and had to wait for the employees to call your number. They had a bunch of popfigures and plushies and various other merch out and they had no prices on them but I found an adorable little Groot plush and wanted to buy it with the concessions if it wasn't too much. There was no way to scan it to find out how much it was so we tried to flag down an employee to find out how to get it and it took longer than necessary, and he didn't even know the right information. We decided to just check after the movie because it was getting close to starting and almost left to go to the movie before realizing we still had to wait for them to call our number. My husband remarked as we were headed back to the pickup area that if there were actual cashiers we'd already have had our stuff *and* the plush and be in our seats. After the movie we went out and I grabbed the Groot plush again and we tried to get the attention of one of the 2 employees behind the counter for a good 5 minutes.
