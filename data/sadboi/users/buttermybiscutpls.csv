Psoriasis,faojo45,t3_ea80qv,1576265857.0,"the best advice i can give if if you absolutely must scratch, just do it with your finger tips. also, i would tell you to try and not stress out about it because stress is also a main trigger for flare ups. i know its easier said than done, but accepting your psoriasis makes it more manageable to live with. cutting out any nicotine or alcohol also seemed to have helped me tremendously. personally i have scalp and elbow patches and i started my treatment every day for a week, then every other day, to now once a week and it seems to look the best its ever have."
Psoriasis,f7jzeup,t3_dw1wfq,1573790421.0,you‚Äôre beautiful. i have scalp psoriasis as well and recently had to cut all my hair off and it really helps getting directly to the patches. you‚Äôre your own worst enemy and i know its easier said than done but keep that pretty head of yours up (-:

XboxOneGamers,f3tao74,t1_f3tah24,1571125282.0,idk if you edited it or nah but like are you saying i was misunderstanding you trying to joke around? because i just kind of took it as a blatant attack.
XboxOneGamers,f3tadq0,t1_f3ta606,1571124892.0,im so confused on what you mean by that
XboxOneGamers,f3tabjz,t1_f3ta34p,1571124812.0,"you seem like a complete cunt, and i feel sorry you have nothing better to do than try to pick put flaws within people on reddit lol.... maybe get a life or something and you won‚Äôt feel the need to bring others down with you."
XboxOneGamers,f3ta7pm,t1_f3ta34p,1571124666.0,"well maybe don‚Äôt assume things like that? do you know me? no, therefore, do not go around spewing stuff that isn‚Äôt true. the keywords are ‚Äúyou seem.‚Äù how would you know my flaws? im a total stranger to you."
XboxOneGamers,f3t9wmc,t1_f3t9kts,1571124255.0,"well i don‚Äôt appreciate it, and actually found it rather unnecessary and arrogant. if you have a problem with me or what i post, don‚Äôt click on my posts in the first place..... it‚Äôs really that simple. i‚Äôm actually a super self conscious person and did not appreciate you being rude to me at all. i know not everybody is going to like me, but you don‚Äôt have to make me feel bad to teach me some sort of sick lesson when i finally felt comfortable enough to try and find some friends."
XboxOneGamers,f3t9h55,t1_f3t9ebd,1571123699.0,"like i just really wanna know. do you feel like a bigger person now, attacking me from an anonymous app?"
XboxOneGamers,f3t9g3a,t1_f3t9ebd,1571123663.0,can i what the purpose was?

bipolar,f391z5v,t3_dg38qj,1570742704.0,this made me laugh and im going through a depressive episode rn
depression,f38s8bb,t1_f364btm,1570739385.0,"does he have any way of contacting your parents? if they hate each other that much, i dont see why your toxic partner would even want to show his face in front of your parents. however, you could also take the route of informing your parents and try to keep the environment peaceful and calm so points get across. if this conversation goes civilly they might be more willing to help you more than you think. at the end of the day they are your parents and it may not seem this way because they‚Äôre being harsh but in reality they just hate this guy so much probably because care about you. idk if this makes any sense but just a food for thought"
depression,f3638t6,t3_dfw6bi,1570704682.0,"are you safe in this relationship? i also want to say im sorry to hear you feel this way. from experience, leaving a toxic relationship was one of the most freeing feelings EVER. i‚Äôm not saying this will solve all of your negative thoughts or problems, but it will be a heavy burden off your shoulders. did you know the first step to healing is acknowledging your issues? maybe you don‚Äôt have the energy to do both, but you can always start with baby steps. know you are worth more than to be treated toxically in any type of relationship. i know its easier said than done, but i believe in you redditor and i truly hope you can find this worth within yourself too."
depression,f362pvg,t3_dfvzhb,1570704215.0,"i know it seems endless, but it takes time to heal. i do understand what you are going through very well, it‚Äôs something i still personally struggle with. it seemed the more i obsessively dwelled over it, the worse it got. just try to surround yourself with healthy distractions even if you have no desire to do so. setting tiny goals like this will eventually build and maybe make you feel proud or successful? idk just medications will make the numbness worse (sort of like a robotic feeling) and has a high risk of throwing in some suicidal thoughts to the mix. speaking from years of experience. i hope you start to regain control of your emotions again (:  stay safe & strong"
