It means that we acknowledge that scientific progress is directly related to human power, wether this power is used constructively or destructively.

We should celebrate this power.

Self knowledge and knowledge of the environment means having a chance at transforming it and transforming ourselves as individuals and as a society.
We need less ""common sense"" and more ""logical sense""
because the ""common sense"" of the average joe differs drastically from the ""common sense"" of the scientific community or, for example, the ""common sense"" from the virologists, who warned us of the measures needed for this crisis, and we didn't listen, because we are used to the habit of not valuing scientific thinking over ""common sense"", one of the reasons.

Anything that goes against these basic notions is against Technocracy.

I'd add more thoughts, but my lunch break is nearly over."

Said factors can be improved, and if I can improved those things (which I slowly did) I can see my emotional state change.

Of course I am saying this from a cold perspective, but truth be told: I'm juggling between feeling in control and losing it and killing myself

I still feel and know I have control over my emotional state and life in general, is just that a lot of times I feel like it's not worth it, so that feeling of loneliness becomes sharper and more painful.

I guess I'll get better, if I don't I can just kill myself."

I was an outcast, I still feel like it from time to time, but hey, I learned social skills over time, through reading and testing, I learned not to act like an awkward robot, ironically I approached it with a purely logical aproach haha, but hey it worked

I still feel like shit, oh god I hate this life, but hey, I'm able to adapt, I'm not completely lost

yeah I have a hard time dealing with people and feeling satisfied and maintaining relationships and talking to girls, but I am not lost! And I don't think you are either, you're 14 and even though your life is shit right now there is still an endless sea of interesting, exciting and useful things you haven't experienced yet, just like me, just like everyone else

when you develop tunnel vision and think that nothing with change it's because you don't doubt at all about what you know.

But what if you could learn the things that they didn't taught you?

that's what I did

I never asked my parents about social skills, I just did it all on my own, I'm still learning, slowly, buying books, watching videos, testing people
over the years I've met people and friends and girls I had relationships with
I'm an ugly-average looking asian guy 5'7"" and I don't even know how managed to get a gf back then

I find it hard to make friends, to maintain them, I don't know why. Yet it is obvious that I need social connection, because I feel lonely as fuck most of the time.

It doesn't help the fact that what I learn from guides about making friends actually help me manipulate people's emotions.
