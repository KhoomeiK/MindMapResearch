I got anxiety, depression and suicidal ideation but not really any delusions or paranoia currently, due to avoiding any stressors.

I stopped taking my meds overnight multiple times in the past because I was fed up with the side effects. It sucked but then my psych would make me try new meds to see if it would work better for me. I couldn't communicate to my psych that I wasn't happy with my meds so I simply stopped taking them. The combination I'm on now, I have accepted for now at least."
NEET,fpjlv75,t3_gdmc9w,1588673390.0,I think losing a job can lead to a feeling of hopelessness and uncertainty for the future. That and many people derive identity from their work. It’s a complicated topic probably and I’m certainly no expert.

depression,fp8z6mk,t3_gbzlka,1588408231.0,I feel you. My mother would make fun of me when I was having bad panic attacks.
