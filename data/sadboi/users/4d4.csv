When I'm not trying to mold the church from my pew :-P, I can just worry about me and fill in the gaps in the church as I see them come up."

Psychosis,fmsgp1x,t3_fx6lxd,1586355102.0,I'm sorry if my advice is unhelpful. But I find that when I go through this sort of thing I remind myself that my being hurt or feeling bad is the whole point of whatever is blaming me for things. It doesn't actually care about whatever it's making up. It'll use anything so long as it can yell at me. And thus I realize that it's attacks are without merit.

If you were not explicitly and consciously trying to communicate to God it would not be relevant. I'm pretty sure God understands that dreams are fictional."

I've had two crises from my condition which threatened my job and both times I tried meds and both times the meds were a bigger threat to my working than the episode. Each episode had a point. Each was about a major problem in my life that needed addressed. 

The first time I had to leave my job at Google to go back to my hometown since I wasn't fully admitting how homesick I was.

The second time was fairly recent and I had to realize that several events that I thought were supernatural were actually vivid hallucinations. I had no idea that hallucinations could be that real.

 I'm very high functioning. If I hadn't gone public at my church the vast majority would have no idea.

schizophrenia,f9ngue4,t3_e5mf1o,1575484255.0,Cure? Forget cure it'd be nice to have a cause. Diagnosing someone with schizophrenia is like diagnosing someone with fatigue rather than cancer.

Also what you may not have noticed is that there is a ""preachers voice"" that has slowly developed among Evangelical Christian speakers in America. It features an authoritarian tone and the assumption that people will implicitly agree with what they're going to say. Matt has seemingly been able to abandon it."

tmbhpodcast,f6p5nhv,t3_drawe3,1573048123.0,"OK time for my pet theory. (full disclosure: I have a mild case of Schizophrenia)

Anyone see any resemblance between the virgin birth and Sons of God creating the Nephilim as found in [Genesis 6:1-4](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+6&version=NASB)? (might need to switch to your preferred version)

I'm wondering if the conception of Jesus and what was described in Genesis is actually the same mechanism.

I'll give you a moment to calm down and stop thinking I'm questioning the deity of Jesus or suggesting that there could ever be anyone or thing that could challenge his position.

It's just that so often sin in this world is just the bastardization of some good thing that God made. A great example of this would be rape. I don't think that was really part of God's design, but it certainly does happen. I wonder if these ""Sons of God"" discovered something that God had created, something that would be used for him enter this world as a human, and instead they used it for evil purposes."
