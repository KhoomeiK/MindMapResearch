CreepyWikipedia,fld3bru,t1_flckpe6,1585055445.0,"Yeah, so as far as I know it started last year when the host, Mike Boudet posted something misogynistic about women on International Women's Day and Wondery decided to drop the show due to this. The host of another podcast that I really like as well was pulled into it. It was Aaron Mahnke of Lore. Anyway the debate was really polarized and people were nasty with each other over what happened, what didn't happen, what he meant, it was just a joke,etc... 

It was this point where I decided I was done and had left most of the S&S groups I was in. I really enjoyed the podcast and didn't want to get sucked into the BS, I just really liked the show. I guess what happened was that he stepped down and a gal named Tricia Griffith who had been on the show a few times, and who has her own website called websleuths came in to narrate the show. She did a great job, and her interviews with him were great, but for me it wasn't the same so I stopped listening for awhile. 

I get back on and listen to the old shows mostly because I feel like the show really filled a niche and I haven't been able to find anything quite like it. Some come close, but not close enough. I have listened to a few of the new ones now that he's back narrating, but it seems like things have changed and some of this mysogynistic and other negative speak/behavior has become more prevalent in the show now, and I personally don't want to support that. To each their own. 

I think this is ongoing though, and new things still come out. There is some info on Wikipedia. Just wish the old show was back."
CreepyWikipedia,flb9qqt,t3_fnntsh,1585000249.0,"The unexplained disappearance of a 12-year-old boy named Johnny Gosch. The podcast Sword and Scale did a great two part series on it. Episodes 5-6 I believe. (Politics of the podcast aside, I thought that the first and second season we're incredibly well done.)  I highly recommend it and there's a book or two on my reading list about the subject as well. It's worth going down in my opinion.

BusinessFashion,fkpge0f,t3_fjout6,1584409527.0,"So true. I had a fun idea though. I think I may overhaul my wardrobe if I end up working from home. I feel like this may happen any day now. (I live in Salt Lake City if anyone was interested) I'm trying to stay indoors as much as possible to help do my part.

Anyway, not sure if any of you are familiar with the book called ""The Curated Closet"" by Anuschka Rees. It's amazing! She has you take pictures of all of your outfits for two weeks and helps you streamline and create your own authentic style. There is a workbook as well. It goes into color palette, style, shape, patterns, textures, creating a physical fashion board so you can really pick and choose statement pieces, etc.

Anyway, with all the extra time I see coming my way, I think I'm going to revamp my style a bit and come up with some new ideas. Take a bunch of photos, get inspired,  clean out  and organize my closet. 

It could also be fun to post about future work attire ideas. Or maybe what your dream work outfit would be and why.  I'm working on becoming a life Coach that focuses on self worth and growth after trauma so I feel like I have been living solely in mind the last few months. I need to reconnect with my physical body.  I have also been kind of stuck and uninspired with my choice of clothing that I wear to the job that pays the bills. I realize that that needs to change. 

Sorry for the novel. I don't really post on Reddit that much. 

Stay safe and stay inspired!"

 I wouldn't eat near my boyfriend unless he's watching TV, playing music or there's some sort of background noise. (I'm not bothered is we are eating together). He's told me multiple times that it doesn't bother him and will joke about it, but I still worry about it sometimes. 

I work in a cubicle now as well, and am constantly wondering if I am making too much noise. I am working on getting past this and realizing that it's to make noise just by living and you are allowed to. You don't need permission. The same with realizing that it's ok to take up space and just validate  that you're here and deserve to live comfortably and make and eat that crunchy popcorn or what have you."

Thetruthishere,fg2b0oo,t3_ewggug,1580441670.0,I've had experiences on and off since I was little. The most recent was about two years ago. I was going through a really hard time at work and was dealing with a lot of negative energy. I woke up in the middle of the night and it was standing in the door frame of my b bedroom. I blinked a few times to focus and stayed still because I was terrified. The last time I held my eyes closed it left.  After that encounter I feel like it was the negative energy that caused it to show up.
