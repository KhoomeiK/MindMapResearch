Suddenly it changed in my mid 20s and I realized that my prefrontal cortex had finally completed development. Your central mode network or whatever it‚Äôs called is not in full gear yet. In other words, your mind is still so moldable. You have a lot of neuroplasticity. IMO 16 is just not the right age for psychs. The benefit won‚Äôt be as pronounced yet.

I also had a nightmare experience and had a legit psychological near breakdown afterwards, but the experienced forced me make peace with death and the fact that I don‚Äôt have control and suddenly the impossible happened.

Your entire life may be a dream, a simulation, anything at all.  Reality is probably so much grander than any of us can imagine. And that‚Äôs real. Don‚Äôt limit truth.
