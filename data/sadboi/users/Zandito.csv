transgender,fquvyt7,t3_gkscw4,1589665378.0,"LOL the National Guard is the military. I‚Äôm not all ‚Äúhoo-yah‚Äù, but you don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about."
Gin,fqul8pt,t1_fqtd7fj,1589660712.0,"Well, I can tell you who to blame..."
transgender,fqul71e,t1_fqtr6ep,1589660690.0,"As someone in the military, I can factually say that you are boiling the military program down to a biased, one-sided version. There are annual programs the military has to provide medical care, training, supplies, and shared experiences with other countries. NATO has all sorts of countries in the Middle East, so to say that is only an American fight with the purpose of corporate gain is false. We have had other countries join in the Middle East fight that aren‚Äôt even in NATO, they were just anti-Russia or their own oppressors, and felt they were on the same side of the friction. 
There are plenty of jobs that DO NOT involve killing, shooting weapons, or war at all. The military also provides a lot of job opportunities to people with disabilities; people who have families or situations where this is a way to pay for college, gain free training for better jobs, or provide medical insurance and stability for their families.
The military is just a sub-section of not only the US as a whole but foreign nationals can also join. Some foreign nationals join bc they want to thank the country for freeing their land of oppressors, or gain a quick passage to citizenship. 
We actually allowed homosexual members to have legal marriage and health insurance prior to it being a federal law. The majority of our grandfather trans members are actually in Senior Enlisted or Officer positions, and interact with Congress to fight for not only military trans rights but Nationwide trans rights. 

So to just boil the entire system down to a small percentage of your opinion which is from an outsiders‚Äôs prospective, and second-hand knowledge is poor research and spreading hate."

transgender,fqtd1n7,t3_gkscw4,1589636421.0,"To answer the question: very likely it will not. If they lied to congress to have trans members and future trans members banned then this won‚Äôt change anything until the courts decide or we have a new administration.

In regards to the other comment: just because you are in the military does not mean you will go to war, even if there is a draft on which hasn‚Äôt happened since the 70‚Äôs."

transgender,fqqubsn,t1_fqppni4,1589572098.0,"You can not assess into the military if you‚Äôd had hormones or surgery. You can enter and serve as your ‚Äúassigned birth gender‚Äù, or if you weren‚Äôt diagnosed prior to the ban then you must also serve under your ‚Äúassigned birth gender‚Äù AND not receive hormones or surgery under your military insurance. While this person can serve as their true gender they will still have restrictions that grandfathered members don‚Äôt."
