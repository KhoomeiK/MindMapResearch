I also went to a big box store recently and about ten percent weren’t wearing any masked even though my state is in shut down mode. I had to ask a few people to follow the rules of distancing and one way traffic etc... I got some huffs and whatnot but I wonder if it’s only a matter of time until I meet someone who has an attitude with me standing my ground.
I could very easily see someone continue into my space which I view as assault.
