I grew up with republican beliefs. Will stay republican. But I support abortion (to an extreme extent tho) and I support the 2A completely.

I completely agree with the ideas of the protest, but I do not agree with going out and protesting. Apparently people are marching with guns at our capital??? Idk but if they are I think it’s dumb as hell and serves no purpose at this regardless. As for the protesters protesting at her house.... that’s unacceptable and completely uncalled for and is definitely an invasion of privacy and/or property and definitely harassment for sure. There is a constitutional right to freedom of speech and assembly, that’s part of the reason I totally agree with it all. Like that’s the whole reason our country was built/founded was bc we didn’t want GB telling us how to run over here as our own entity.

Again tho, not looking to be harassed but as someone who grew up being instilled republican beliefs but also as the tail end of the millennial gen, and does their own research both ways... I’m just sick of being told what side I’m on, constantly being called a shill (both side) and even getting banned from other subs over next to nothing... I think it’s completely ridiculous and this has all been a complete shitshow (now regardless of how you like or dislike Trump) once Trump even showed up as a presidential candidate before he got elected.
