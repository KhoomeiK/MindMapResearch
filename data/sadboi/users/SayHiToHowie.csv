> but I also was in foster care for 2 years of my life and out of her custody due to extreme circumstances of abuse. My father got mental help during the time and my mother refused to (I was only 14 at this time and in depths of ED at this time). 

Then you shouldn't be living with your mother.  You are an adult.  If you have to take a LOA from school in order to free up the energy to work, then do that.  You should get yourself out of the situation you are in if it is that bad.

> My degree and certifications rn are in elementary education/special education so i am technically qualified to work with kids, 

Just a word of advice.  I would scrub your social media accounts if I were you, because employers and parents do look at those now.  You have written a lot about your issues with your ED and your mother on the internet in accounts that you have identifying info about yourself and even pictures of yourself, and I don't think that is a good idea.  If I were you, I would make a throwaway account to use when you discuss your ED and your mother issues.  And go through your post history and delete any posts about these personal topics that are associated with your accounts in which you have posted pictures of yourself.  There is no reason to have so much personal info about yourself linked to your photo on the internet.  

> but i dont feel healthy enough to be at my very best for the kids i can work with. A desk job would definitely be less physically challenging for me to keep up with at this point while im still in school

Right now the jobs are plentiful but if we go into a recession, which is getting more and more likely, that won't be true.  So I would try to get one now so that if we do go into a recession you have a chance of keeping your job if you have done a good job.

The other people telling you the problem is your mother aren't helping you.  You need to get yourself out of the situation you are in.  It's doable.  Take out student loans if you aren't/can't work.  Go to school part time if you need to in order to free up energy to work.

Daycare around here is more than my mortgage, and we can’t afford for me to quit my job, so we just keep waiting and hoping that one day we’ll be able to afford a baby.

We want a kid desperately, but I think we’re getting resigned to the fact that we’ll never have one.

Lots of people have babies and deal with the financial consequences.  You are choosing to own your own home, which is great, but that is an added expense that you chose to incur.   Lots of people rent because it is cheaper.  Also, what kind of car do you drive?  Do you take vacations?

My parents lived in a crappy apartment and drove beat up old cars and never took vacations when I was a kid.  We were happy though.   Eventually they could buy their own home, but it wasn't until we were older.  They were able to do it eventually because we weren't given a ton of christmas presents, we wore hand me downs, my mom pinched pennies at the grocery store, etc. But we were happy and by scrimping and saving, they were able to not only raise a family, but eventually have a home that they owned.

You have put the cart before the horse, and decided to postpone having kids in order to buy a home.  That's your choice, quit whining about it.

The purpose of seasoning ahead of cooking is to let the salt penetrate the meat.  This not only gives the meat more flavor, it relaxes the proteins so that when they contract during cooking they expel less water.

So you end up with more flavorful and moister meat, but it won't tenderize the meat.

Yes, it's a good idea but not because it tenderizes.  If you want the ribs fall off the bone, they have to be cooked low and slow until they are fall off the bone tender.
