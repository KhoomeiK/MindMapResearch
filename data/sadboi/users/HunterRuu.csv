If I can't be the perfect employee and do everything right and perfect ""I will get yelled at and attacked and then I am not safe"" 

If someone walks behind me and I can't see them, ""I will get attacked, most likely raped, so I am not safe here""

I can't control these thoughts, I just react, and then I'm right back where I was when I was abused. It's like I can't get my mind past GTFO once I feel unsafe.

It's true when they say ignorance is bliss. My troubled mind puts me in denial all the time. 

Like, during my abuse there was this one time that my abuser turned off the lights and made sure the room was really dark I couldn't make out his shape or features at all, and he just acted differently. During, I blacked out. Afterwards I walk out into the living room and my abuser's best friend is sitting there and greets me, like he knew something I didn't and he has this dumb grin on his face. 

Logically I knew I was just passed off to my abuser's best friend. But my mind plays tricks on me. I'm still so dissociated from the situation. Since it was a repressed memory my mind comes up with excuses to try to make it not real. Like I had been in the hospital earlier that day for, what I now know is celiac disease, but I was on some major pain meds, so I probably imagined it, or something.

one of the things that helped me understand and validate my feelings about what happened is a book called ""Psychopath Free"" it explains that you're not just imagining every little loop that your abuser puts you through and even the treating this other woman like a queen is a calculated move to get her in the same position he had you in, while also making you feel like shit.

RATS,ey6nxqz,t3_cvsg7g,1566859986.0,"Some cleaning tips I've learned while researching...

* Some people don't like the smell of Aspen, so kiln-dried pine (and make sure its kiln-dried) and hemp bedding are good alternatives

* Litter training rats (as mentioned in a prev. comment) can help contain where they make their messes and make spot cleaning easier. Pee rocks and a separate bin with separate bedding is the easiest way to train them.

* if you give them some hay or shredded paper they won't eat it, but they will use it as bedding for their hammocks or hidey-holes and it makes it easier to clean them since the hay and paper will absorb their pee better than the fleece.

* invest in an air purifier, don't have it blow into the cage, but set it near the cage to help neutralize the smell.

Sorry for the long comment, but these are all little ways to help keep the smell in check, and keep you from having to deep clean every couple of days, which will make the rats pee more, and essentially smell worse!

RATS,ex853gp,t3_crhcck,1566068867.0,Love your rat tat!
RATS,ex3grbt,t1_ex3frxw,1565985279.0,"Ok, well I'm glad I posted this before I bought it! I'll have to do more searching and probably get a SNC or DNC anyway! Haha

I'm really thankful for your advice! I'm still a total newb at all of this, but I'm glad I can get advice and make the right decisions before I already have the rat babies and I'm freaking out! Haha"
RATS,ex3f07u,t1_ex3cxig,1565984523.0,"I've also been looking at a Parrot cage... 

SUPER DEAL PRO 61''/ 68'' 2in1 Large Bird Cage with Rolling Stand Parrot Chinchilla Finch Cage Macaw Conure Cockatiel Cockatoo Pet House Wrought Iron Birdcage, Black (61'') https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0734SYJQG/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_i_vzWvDb6K4D7K4

It's a lot of vertical space but I planned on a lot of hammocks/ledges/climbing to begin with"
RATS,ex3dvi6,t1_ex3cxig,1565984036.0,"That's what I was afraid of! I've been getting closer to buying a cage and looking at everyone else's with the double doors that open up a whole side of the cage, this one just seems to fall short! 

I'm not stubborn, and I'm willing to move the budget around to shell out the money needed for a cage that's better for both the rats and myself, I was just hoping it would be good enough to start with for the price! Bummer! Lol"
RATS,ex3chhp,t3_crb41w,1565983426.0,"I like this cage a lot! Its HUGE, and I believe it has the right spaces bars! 

I plan on using the bottom 1/4 of it for a digging box and PVC maze.

The downside is that the doors are super tiny and it'll be difficult to arrange/clean things, but I still think its doable.

I can't afford a $200+ critter nation right now so I feel that this is the next best thing.

Is there anything that I'm missing or something I'm not considering with this cage? Or is it a decent one like I feel it is?"
RATS,ex30x2m,t3_cr89bi,1565978431.0,"I would suggest pellets if they are just eating their food out of a bowl, that way they can't get picky and they get all their nutrients! 

On the other hand, if you scatter feed, mixes are really good and enriching way of feeding them. Since they are foraging they will eat what they come across for FOMO instead of getting picky!"
RATS,ex1wj8w,t1_ex0uioc,1565957623.0,"It would be really manipulative of the breeder to tell you she's culling them, and letting you think they've died, if she sold them to someone else!

Best of luck finding some rat babies of your own, I'm sorry it didn't work out for you this time!"
