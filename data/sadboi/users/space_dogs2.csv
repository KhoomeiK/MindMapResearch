Life,fnf8f3h,t3_g1f3sa,1586903316.0,"What are your interests? If youâ€™re interested in something there is always someone who is also interested. Try to find those communities. Obviously itâ€™s way easier said than done. Iâ€™m in my third year of college and my main friends are just roommates that I just got lucky to be randomly paired with. Roommates are always a good way to meet people too. I know it may feel as though your classmates arenâ€™t looking for new friends, but majority of the time thatâ€™s false. People are always looking for more people to connect with. Often times it can just be scary to put yourself out there, but Iâ€™ve found most people appreciate it because they were just as scared. Try to put yourself and see what happens, itâ€™s scary but most of life is and you just gotta push through that fear to find something amazing. I donâ€™t know if any of what Iâ€™m saying is helpful because every person and place is different, but I wish you luck in finding people. Sometimes it does just take time and pushing out of your comfort zone."

Meditation,fmbxgiz,t3_ftqnwv,1585935002.0,"Something thatâ€™s helped me is getting plants! During this time itâ€™s really hard going to completely no schedule or responsibilities so having plants gives you a little of each. So even when you arenâ€™t wanting to take care of yourself you still have to take care of your plants so it gives you something to keep an eye on. They also are incredibly beautiful and lift my spirits just by staring at them haha I also found waking up around the same time and actually getting dressed helps too. Obviously still dress cozy cause itâ€™s quarantine, but just changing out of your pjs is motivational. Iâ€™m really sorry to hear you are going through such a tough time, I hope maybe something said through these posts can help you. I know it doesnâ€™t feel like it now, but you are needed, you are important to this world, donâ€™t give up please. Try to find new things that spark interest, find new music, try art, go on a walk, build legos, anything to get you trying new things each day. Believe in yourself."

Not sure if this answers your question haha
ArtistLounge,fm8gwe6,t3_ftopg1,1585849168.0,"10000% okay!! You do what makes you feel best. Do art for you now and maybe one day youâ€™ll get the interest of sharing it, but if not thatâ€™s totally okay to keep it private. Art is a very personal thing and sometimes when we donâ€™t receive the feedback we were expecting it can be a let down, but you also should be proud of yourself for even putting it out there in the first place cause itâ€™s extremely scary because we become so vulnerable. But also you just completing a piece is really fucking cool and you should be proud of that above all things. Do what makes you happy and donâ€™t worry about the artists pressuring you to share, share or donâ€™t share, just never stop creating art!!(:"

Iâ€™ve been doing art for as long as I can remember from painting to wood shop to drawing to glassblowing to stained glass. I basically would try to get into any of the art classes that sounded really cool haha but recently I took shrooms and went exploring in the woods with my friend. Both being huge plant lovers, we looked at basically every plant in so much detail discussing the different parts of the plant and how beautiful each is. From then on Iâ€™ve been able to see an immense amount of detail in everything now. I have such an appreciation for detail and the time it takes to create those intricate pieces of art. Iâ€™m excited to explore this new side of art that I havenâ€™t yet dug info yet. And I wish you luck on your route to!(:"
