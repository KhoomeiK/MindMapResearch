asklatinamerica,fnmsws9,t3_g2mxm2,1587077537.0,"Yes. America is one continent for us. And has a lot of sense, since the landmass is 1. Then, there's the Ideological/historical/sociological difference. I think english native countries make the division to make the difference between the ""wealthy countries"" in North America, from the ""non developed"" countries in South America. And for us, spanish native people, we fight for the Colonialist vision of United States calling themselves ""americans"".   
Division in your case has a meaning, as the studies on centre-periphery logic remarks."

asklatinamerica,fncbazc,t3_g0ihuj,1586832688.0,"Historician here. As the two first comments say...it's complicated. Americans as individuals aren't literally guilty for the crimes their government commit. BUT, i think a considerable amount of americans agree with international intervention. They believe they bring ""freedom and democracy"" in those countries they invade. And that's not a matter of good and evil, freedom vs slavery, democracy vs communism. It 's a matter of power and economic profit. the government makes a speech on how America is bringing those nice things to the countries they invade, and you believe they will be better with your intervention. And almost every time.....they aren't.

Btw. I liked the ""level"" of the discussion here."

unpopularopinion,fn7xp6n,t3_g01r6p,1586729730.0,"I think it depends. I had depression, and one of the main problems i had was the inability to do nothing for myself, due to the self hatred. People don't always have the mental state to improve themselves. But there are also the cases when people tend to blame others for their inability to do something, when the real problem is them (like incels). So...idk. I think you can't generalize."

The other story is we had sex, and a few hours later i left. When I got home, i read a message from the same boyfriend telling me palta (""avocado"" his dog) took the condom envelope and left it in front of the entrance. His mother, with her gf and the gf sister, suddenly get in the house, and found the proof just there. Was embarrassing for him, and for me in consequence."
