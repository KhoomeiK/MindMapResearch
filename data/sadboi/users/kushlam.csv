mbti,fl6kn03,t1_fl6izwb,1584873256.0,"I think the important thing about emotional problems is many people, specially people who ""feel"" a lot, they need to let there emotions out. They might be feeling all sorts of things from feeling alone to wanting to end it all, they need someone, a ""sink"" to let these things go to.
So there are two ways to go about it imo
1. Stay silent. It will be awkward, very awkward, but if they want to say something, they'll say it if you allow the space for them to.
This is something which does not seem to work on paprr but it really does.
2. The above can be difficult to do sometimes as our natural reponse in a convo is to respond once a person says something. So, just repeat what they just said with a little bit of your own interpretation. That's it. For example, they just said, ""I feel terribly alone and I have no friends""  a good ""response"" can be ""Oh, you feel you have no friends and that is why you feel alone"". This does three things - 
i. Your interpretation of their problem is checked. They might very often correct you if you got it wrong.  In the above case, they might go on to say ""No, I feel terribly alone and awful and that is why I do noy have friends"".
ii. They actually feel listened to and acknowledged by someone at a time when they might not be able to justify the feelings they are having, even to themselves.
iii. In correcting you or otherwise, they might let out other feelings which help themselves and also help you in figuring their shit out.

Above all, empathise if you can, try and put yourself in their place to understand them better.

TL; DR -  Just listen or repeat what they said and try to empathise if possible.
