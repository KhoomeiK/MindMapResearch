EnneagramType4,fofshdj,t1_fof72q5,1587742033.0,"Thank you! I’m still kind of surprised how far I’ve come, although I still have my issues.

First of all, I had a really good therapist. But from the start, I took to non-directive therapy because I was so frustrated with CBT and similar approaches. I know CBT is very effective for a lot of people, but I would always have initial success with it, then gradually develop this awkward feeling that I was trying to put thoughts into my head rather than freely and naturally thinking the thoughts for myself.

Also, I had been deeply studying Buddhism, which has as one of its cardinal tenets “anatta”: the absence of an essential self. Now, Buddhism is a world religion, with countless interpretations, but FOR ME that particular teaching was not helpful. I felt like I had lost my core. 

So non-directive therapy was really good for me because it taught me to trust my gut. I also came to see how (and we 4s know all about this) I had been extremely hard on myself for decades. I work in media, and I had unconsciously fallen into a kind of performing in my interactions with others. I needed to reclaim some sense of authenticity, rather than attempt to morph into some “best version of myself”.

I really hope that’s helpful."
EnneagramType4,fof4i6h,t3_g6zpft,1587725730.0,"4w9 here. Not to get too personal, but a couple of years ago I went through a course of non-directive therapy that finally allowed me to be comfortable just being me, without trying to fit into some self-imposed concept of an ideal self. It's amazing how much easier and more natural life is. I still aspire to grow and be a better person, but I also value and love myself, at least the great majority of the time. But as a 4, my fantasy life is still vivid as ever!"

One thing I might recommend... the official PRS Youtube video for the Standard 24 (not the Custom) really, to my ears, captures what’s unique about the 85/15s.

The Paul's Guitar has the TCIs pickups, which I think would be more pleasing to somebody looking for a more vintage, traditional HB tone. And the Paul's Guitar has more pickup switching options, so that's a consideration.

“To master the sexual force you must have a high ideal, a tremendous love for perfection, purity and beauty. This is not easy and needs an entire science if you are to succeed. Without a high ideal, without an aspiration to live the divine life, it is not worth struggling against the sexual force because you will not succeed in sublimating it.

Following the example of Sri Ramakrishna, I’m pretty much a universalist too; I attend a Christian Church (yes, I see Jesus as an avatar) and my wife is a Muslim. So it wouldn’t be fair for a person like me, who admittedly has taken diksha from a guru, to claim I’m a full-fledged Hindu. I don’t do pujas, I don’t follow a vegetarian diet, and I don’t celebrate Hindu holidays in any big way. That said, I am inspired and instructed by those who do all those things. 

While I am grateful my teachers give me the option of embracing the parts of the Sanatan Dharma that resonate with me, my personal feeling is that claiming that doing so makes me a White Hindu is terribly presumptuous. My Indian friends seem to regard this as a respectful position.

Also, I think some converts are looking for a new, fresh identity. That’s not necessarily a bad thing, but there seems to be an initial phase during which Westerners interested in Eastern traditions play a bit of dressup, and I’m sure that’s annoying to those who those cultures belong to.
