The thing he is busy on other days. And as I said I've been sick and went through surgery so we haven't gone out with each other properly for like more than a month nor had sex for more than a month. And I ask to spend the day with him since he is free and my health is finally getting better, its not just about valentine's day.

And about my face skin I honestly just stopped using towels on my face, I found out that my skin is pretty sensitive, like literally my skin gets red when I dry myself with the towel and I didnt think much of it but it was causing so much trouble. So after showers or just before sleep I would wash my face with water and wait just a bit and apply my moisturizer while my face was still set. 

But idk about you, our cases are probably different.

Thanks again."
