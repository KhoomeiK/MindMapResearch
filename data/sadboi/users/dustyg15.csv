personalfinance,fgv107l,t3_f0m52c,1581134133.0,"Whenever you see a much higher apr than rate, that tells you there are more fees built in. The broker quote is higher because they are building their fees in to turn a profit. As soon as the loan closes, they sell the mortgage to a bigger investor. I work in mortgage and would recommend going to a bank rather than a broker."
TheOutsider,ffpqtf4,t1_ffpo70i,1580102462.0,The book doesn’t mention anything about New York. I believe they added this to fill content. Was interesting to see as we all probably wondered how far back this pattern goes
TheOutsider,ffpqmrl,t1_ffph520,1580102290.0,The previous episode was when he first heard from the outsider. They didn’t have the outsider talk like in the book. Jack just rubbed his neck and said he would do what he was told. Same goes with the child talking to the outsider. I assume they will have the outsider voice in jacks head next episode as they also showed the outsider confrontation with Ralph’s wife.
AskReddit,ffnit1k,t3_eu6iol,1580066464.0,Was maybe 10 years old. Was looking for new hoodies (hooded sweatshirt). Didn’t know how to spell it. Typed hooties.com into the url. Just a site with a ton of tits. Instantly turned the computer off and shamefully went to my room.

TheOutsider,ffgcag5,t1_ffg9c3i,1579903066.0,Oh damn assumed he is British. I thought at first maybe he was using the lisp in character. I don’t notice it as much as when he was for example Talos. I really would like to see him get more chances as the protagonist in acting jobs. Seems like he gets put into the antagonist a lot. He clearly is showing he can handle the lead IMO.
TheOutsider,fffsz57,t3_et85v2,1579891131.0,"Yeah just high lol. If you’ve watched Captain Marvel or Rogue One, you would notice that’s how he talks. Could also be part of him trying to keep the American accent as he is British"
TheOutsider,ffd7g0r,t1_ffcydzc,1579814891.0,The ones the news article holly is reading mentions. Also other inmates heckle him like they did Terry
TheOutsider,ffd7cj4,t1_ffcgqxe,1579814839.0,I have a feeling they push it to a later episode when he may be coming to grips with things not being as they seem
TheOutsider,ffd788f,t3_esvqip,1579814774.0,"The cantaloupe looks perfectly fine on the outside, but when he cut it open it was full of maggots. A symbol for things are not as they seem. Could be used as an analogy for Terry was perfect on the outside, but rotten on the inside. Also it’s foreshadow to the end with all the worms"
TheOutsider,ffceldm,t3_espwzm,1579797789.0,"I think episode 10 is aftermath and the planning to cover it up. I assume 7 ends with the death of Jack after the shootout. I could see 8 as a flashback or something the else that elaborates on something off book.

Interesting that there are multiple vehicles here and not just Jacks truck and the rented suv.

Has anyone watched the “weeks ahead preview”?
In that trailer Claude is with them in the convoy of suvs heading to the cave. We also catch a glimpse of The Outsider standing up from the cot in the cave. Interested to see how they expand on the book."
TheOutsider,ffb3qin,t3_esj5gp,1579751015.0,I like the way Will Patton voices her in the audio book. Sounds like this actress is trying for the same delivery which grew on me as the book went along. I feel people will grow to like her.
TheOutsider,ff55vq8,t3_ernakq,1579581109.0,He is the hospital worker that killed the two girls. This lines up based on the preview for next week where it shows him slipping and cutting Terry.
TheOutsider,ff55l51,t3_erkm14,1579580871.0,I was confused too but understood what they were doing by the end of the episode. The body was found shortly after Terry killed the kid as the van was still parked there. I assume he just missed the guy with the dog and left when the guy discovered the body. That’s when the little girl sees Terry get back in the van and drive off to the Peach Crease.

Anxiety,exn47z5,t3_ctrsqr,1566445893.0,"Happens to me too since I started lifting. Basically from what people have said on here it is from your body reacting to overexerction. This makes you feel like something is off and the anxiety creeps in. I find that I get the body buzzyness and anxiety symptoms from the adrenaline. I think you should maybe cut it back to build up. That’s what I’m going to do. Rather than go from 0-100, take it easy and build up. Be happy you are working hard to better yourself. We’re all in this together"

LightsCameraPodcast,es52005,t1_es4cqx2,1561599755.0,I’m guessing part of this was overblown by Dave. He was creating content. I’m sure there was some truth to it but the numbers on today’s episode and subsequent tweets etc drive content. Similar to the Ria situation last year and the countless times he had ripped into OMB and Gaz.
