I mean while it was happening, some of it was fun, a lot of it was stressful but there were some cool parts and even though I went on about how there isn't a way to go back and stop it from happening, even if I could I wouldn't, it changed me hopefully more for the better than for the worse, the only reason I'd think about it was so I could keep my family from being traumatized from the whole experience"
BipolarReddit,fnx5v29,t1_fnx2rw7,1587332078.0,"I meant like yeah we can take meds and we can take care of ourselves but there's still a chance it can happen again. I'm on medication but that doesn't mean our brain chemistry changed, like you said if we stopped talking it it could come back, that's what I'm talking about, I didn't phrase it right but I meant that no matter what we do there's always a chance we can go down that hole again.

Omg I came up with new philosophies (I called them theories) allll the time when I was manic I would send them to my friends and my partner and even my therapist. They were solid theories that made sense to others but idk. I made one called bubble theory and my therapist said I should write a book about it, I didn't but that was cool to hear.

I'm very glad that all my preaching happened in my bathroom while screaming, thinking I was giving these life changing speeches to all these people and I was hitting walls when the person would change.. but that also seems maybe even more insane than yelling at people because at least you're having a real conversation, neither are great and both are very insane but idk, everything was all in my head and that's a hard part to think about."

Idk what you mean by the second question. If by new lens you mean mania, it didn't just change anything it changed absolutely everything. Besides the fact that I like helping people and even with that I wasn't thinking about it, it was just what felt right. But besides that I didn't know who I was, where I was, what I was doing, or who any of the people in my life were, I could remember their sprit but I didn't really know who they were. I knew the person and the feeling I got from that person but I didn't know the body, if someone had said they were my mom i might've just believed them. Mania doesn't just change how you see the world, it changes almost every cell in your body.

Sleep would've given my brain a break to recharge so it wouldn't have run itself into a brick wall, it might not have stopped it but it would've slowed it down. I was up for 48 hours I believe and was probably getting very little sleep prior and doubt I drank any water during those 48 hours and probably again very little before and same with food. It was just a mix of everything that can make it worse, if I had known what I know now I would've made sure I ate and drank and slept and that helps tame mania pretty well, to an extent of course but the key to a healthy mind is having a healthy body so giving it the things it needs like food water and sleep it handles the hurdles a lot better."
bipolarart,fnt47co,t3_g3lqy0,1587234291.0,"It's a very scary thought... I wish none of us had to worry about that.

We shouldn't have to not only worry about the next time we loose ourselves but also if we'll ever get ourselves back..

I've been thinking a lot about stuff that happened when I was in a psych ward and I realized I truly didn't know who I was, I didn't know who the people in my life were, I didn't know ... Anything. I mean I knew a LOT but most of what I knew wasn't even real and the rest I was just guessing. It's really scary knowing that that could happen again. 

Let's all just hope that if (don't use when) we loose ourselves again we're able to come back and hope on everything that we didn't leave a path of destruction to go back to, at least not one we can't fix.

I used to go on this anonymous confessions app, whisper. I would post AMA's which means ask me anything and although the VAST majority of responses are ""what's your bra size"" and ""what're you wearing"" and so on and omg so many of them would start off with like hey and I was like 🙃 BITCH THAT WASN'T A FUCKING QUESTION I used to be fine with it like when I was younger and I just wanted to talk to people but small talk gets hella fucking old so I started writing in the posts ""get creative and don't just say hi or else I won't respond"" AND GUESS WHAT THEY FUCKING DID!! THEY ALL JUST FUCKING SAID HI!! God I fucking hate people. Okay it wasn't all of them but it was still an annoying amount. Anyway a lot of them are stupid but there are some interesting ones plus I found some of my best friends on there. 

Referring to this ""THE LAST thing I fucking want to EVER hear from someone is “that sucks’ because that’ s a lame fucking response. At the very least say something like “honestly, I don’t know what to say besides that really sucks” 

DUDE OMG I'M SO FUCKING SICK OF PEOPLE FUCKING NEVER PUTTING EFFORT INTO THEIR FUCKING WRITING LIKE HAVE A NICE SOPHISTICATED FUCKING CONVERSATION FOR FUCKING ONCE IN YOUR LIFE it's because our generations are just getting fucking worse which means they're getting stupider and idc that they're still young they're horrible and I genuinely don't think they're gonna grow out of it like do you fucking see these fucking dance moves?!?!?!?! Other generations get the Walts and the tango and the Charleston AND WHAT DID OUR GENIUS ASS CHILDREN MAKE?? THE MOTHERFUCKING FLOSS LIKE WTF IS THAT WHY DO YOU DO THAT?!?!? JUST FUCKING STOP!!! In the new Sonic movie he flossed twice and the audience sounded like if we had filled it with a bunch of hypersexual manic bitches who hadn't gotten laid in 10 years and have a lot of fucking hot people take their shirts off on screen 😂😂😂😂 wait fuck they'd all just start having sex with each other 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 and let's be real no  mania prone person could go 10 years without sex😂😂😂😂😂

Again with multiple perspectives.. so I kind of hear voices but I also think they could just be my thoughts but it's like there are different people in my head for all of my different emotions kinda like the movie inside out. They're not always there and usually it's only one at a time but sometimes they're all there and it's like we're in a conference room meeting like everyone around a round table and and people take turns talking (not organized turns obviously) but it's usually arguing from what I remember (I'm never really sure) and like in order for them to like say what they need to say they have to go through me so I'm being hit with emotion after emotion and then I look fucking crazy because I fucking do it out loud sometimes oh shit is that rapid cycling?? Yeah it is... Anyway I think of those as my different perspectives because it's like seeing everything through different lenses.. wait these are just like our moods changing I wonder why I created like people, unless other people do that to, that'd be kinda cool. My friend said it was a coping mechanism from my psychotic break/first manic episode/first psych ward addmittion  but idk how this would help me cope.. hm

Idk if you've ever been admitted before but like I sometimes just start thinking about how I was like admitted to a psych ward and like the psychotic part of the psych ward not the depression/anxiety/whatever wards (not trying to be offensive in anyway it's just an existential crisis lol) but like the fucking Looney bin like WTF??? WHAT FUCKING HAPPENED MY BRAIN FUCKING BROKE HOW DOES THAT FUCKING HAPPEN???????????? Like I was able to stimulate my brain so much that it just blacked out?¿?¿?¿ How is that even fucking possible???? 

You're so right all you need is to be insanely open and then people either realize it's okay to open up, feel bad and don't want you to feel alone or realize that they aren't alone and maybe they've been waiting for that person to open up to OR they get really uncomfortable and start avoiding you 😂😂😂. I've gotten a few times that ""I've never told anyone that before"" and I love it so much. Being able to make people open up about stuff is really amazing. Do you think that is a thing too? Like people open up more to bipolar people? We are known for being charming and magnetic so like 🤷 also I love making people happy and making them smile, do you think that's common too? Since you said you pay attention to what people need to be comfortable enough to open up... Honestly I kinda hope that it's caused by being bipolar, thinking about the good parts we get out of this makes the bad parts easier, not by much but still, being mesmerized but a sun set or the stars or the forest or the ocean or just anything beautiful is really amazing and just in general finding so much more beauty in the world and in people, it's amazing. ""You have to endure the darkness to see the light or appreciate the light or something and we not only see darkness, we see blackness and we see it a lot. 

Do you ever do hand gestures? Like some weird ass tweaker shit? Not being able to stop, going all around your body, really fast and sporadic like some stuff that if you were out in public at night and was seen doing it the cops would definitely be called ya know? Lol. I do it a lot when I panic, this one is definitely a coping mechanism. In the psych ward I was doing it when I was just talking with someone but I was doing it and she asked if I knew sign language and since I literally didn't know who I was I just kinda figured I some how learned sign language and so well that I didn't need to think about it 🤷 so I said yes lol

Idk if anyone here is bothered by just trailing off onto different tangents but like I need to rant to people that actually understand what I'm talking about and who aren't just going to feel bad that I'm going through this and not know what to do to help or even just to say."
BipolarReddit,fiy7czz,t1_fiy3agg,1582833963.0,"I was also watching psych ward documentaries last night and one of them most of the people were bipolar and seeing that behavior that you can recognize, the subtle changes in stature and behavior that other people can't really see, the little flicker in their eye, the mask that gets put on our faces, we can see them because we've done them and we've felt them and we know what that look means and just seeing that behavior in other people really shines a light on what we're doing to ourselves. Like one of the girls (who was seeing things) she was scratching herself because rats were telling her to and her mom called it self harm... I scratch myself when I have panic attacks or get really angry and it just doesn't feel like self harm I honestly thought that self harm was the one thing I didn't do... But I was wrong and that's really really rough to realize...

Also one of the guys with bipolar was a dad and the second time he was admitted was because his son said that he was starting to do manic behaviors... I don't think I could handle my kids telling me I need to be admitted, I'd be grateful obviously because they can see me better than I can but knowing that they know that behavior and that they know when I'm truly truly not okay... That's scary

I'm so far down a rabbit hole I don't even know what's happening. I just hope this new medication idea is going to work and that I'm gonna be okay for a while, how ever short that while will be...

Idk how we do this. I never like saying that I've been through stuff or that I've struggled or that it's impressive that I'm still fighting because I have a pretty privilaged physical life other than having chronic kidney stones which I also dont think is struggle enough to say even though everyone is so fucking scared to get a kidney stone and I'm over here constantly having at least 3 but like this shit is fucking hard and yeah we get through it but every time we have to get through something it leaves some damage no matter how aware of it we are, it's scarring us and we're abusing ourselves and this shit isn't something a lot of people could handle and idk how we do. It just feels like something I just have to get through and since I never let myself have a way out, suicide, because that's the only way out of this for good but personally I think suicide is stupid, I understand it and I understand how you could get to that point but if you get there and succeed you have no more points, there's no next anything, yeah it's likely that the next thing is going to be hard but what if it's amazing, what it it's life changing, what if you finally find the thing that works, if you're dead you have none of that. I believe suicide is an exit plain and simple but one of my friends doesn't share that opinion but she wouldn't ellaborate so if anyone reads this and doesnt agree that it's an just an exit strategy please explain because I genuinely can not see it as anything else. I mean you're exiting life, you're exiting the situation, it's not an option, it's not a strategy, it's an exit and a permanent exit at that. It has crossed my mind vaguely but again if you do that you don't get anything else, you don't get a second chance and there is no real proof that heaven or even hell exists so like it could just be black, not even black, it's nothing. There is no finding your soul mate, living out your lives together, there's no graduation day, there's no kids, there's no family, there is just nothing and I understand how that can sound appealing to someone whose been through a lot of pain and has fought long and hard but no matter how long you've fought you can still win the battle and the fact that all these young people are deciding to give up so early is so disheartening not just that they feel like they've been through so much but that they don't realize that life changes, that it gets better (sometimes worse) but it changes and the struggles you face today might not be the struggles you face tomorrow... That might only be true for bipolar... Awkward but still you never know what the future holds and if you cut that future off you'll never find out. Honestly I think all these young people who want to do it who also feel like it's not as big of a deal because so many people have done it they should get to like 50+ and then if they still wanna die they can do it but at least they gave it a fair shot at least they lead a life, contributed (possibly) to society to change to the greater well being of society and they fought truly for a long time.  I know this is a very controversial topic and I'm sure my opinion isn't widely shared but it's my opinion and I need to get it off my chest and I need to know what others think about it

I'm sorry for such long posts but writing my feelings is easy for me and so if I start I'll keep going until I've said all I need to, and usually I have a lot to say, at least in text."
BipolarReddit,fiy3agg,t1_fix2r5o,1582831651.0,"Also I have started thanking my fiancé when I'm like having a panic attack and he holds me and makes the shaking stop or he keeps me from hurting myself when I'm really mad or when he does one of the literal thousands things he can to help me get through this.

Dude this really fucking sucks like I'm a really optimistic person but this fucking sucks like wtf are we supposed to do? Literally the only thing we can do is just, get through. There are medications and therapies to help us get through but we're still going to be bipolar we're still going to have the ability to loose complete control over every aspect of ourselves, we're able to loose ourselves within ourselves and not care what happens to the rest of our life, that shit is terrifying and although I have a decent amount of years before I start thinking about actually having babies i still think about how I could pass this on to them and even if I don't they're still going to have to live with a bipolar mother and I've seen some videos and a commercial that fucking broke me, watching the kids talk about their parent's manic behavior like it's just another aspect of their life to just deal with and I'm okay with me having to do that because I have to and I still hate that my fiancé had to but he's here by choice, they won't be, they'll be stuck with me. The commercial I watched was for a drug and the beginning line was her daughter saying ""sometimes my mom can't do things with me"" and after that I turned up my music on my earbuds hella loud and tried to block everything out... I really don't want to hurt them, I don't want them to see me get blinded by rage or loose all feelings or loose all of myself I don't want them to see any of it and I'm good at hiding it but I can't hide everything especially all the time... It really fucking hurts to think about because I want kids but this disease makes it really really really really scary, so many things can go wrong. We can go into psychosis from the hormones and the post partum depression is already bad on its own but when you add in a disease that takes that spiralling and puts it in over drive... What if I forget about my baby? What if I go manic while pregnant and end up doing something that could kill it? What if I go to the psych ward again? I don't want them living with a woman who needs to be contained in a building inorder to not hurt herself or others? What if I black out again? What if I... There ar too many possibilities and it's making me not want to have them but I know I want them and I know I have the support to get through it but I don't just want to get through their childhood I want to be there and be present with them and for them always but that's simply not a likely outcome, at least not for all the time...

I've learned that you have to be open completely or maybe not completely completely but like you have to be open about yourself even if people don't ask because then they know they can be open to you...

I agree that rn he is not a good person but this is absolutely connected with his bipolar. I've broken up with my SO when I was manic and I've been broken up with by a friend who is also bipolar and every part of the OPs story lines up with my experiences. We can be very heartless people but it's not our choice it doesn't make us bad people it just means there is something very wrong with our brains. I'm very much aware of all my manic symptoms and even if I want to do something about it when it's happening I can't, the thing that takes over our brain to make us do these things or to make our moods change at the drop of a hat or to make us legitimately go psychotic it's truly not something we can control even if we try, it might help a little but not enough to stop us from unknowingly hurting those we care about. It's really really fucked up and I thought that after I was diagnosed and I'm able to recognize what's happening now I thought I would be able to control it and I can sometimes but when it takes over our brain enough to make us break off from the people we love, it's really not something we can control."

BipolarSOs,f8c067u,t3_e03c9a,1574449361.0,"This sounds like an extremely classic manic break up. We like playing the victim, our brains like telling us we're the victim even if we're completely in the wrong. I'm sorry this happened but how he feels right now is not how he's gonna feel in a few months or when ever this episode is over. That girl is a distraction, please please don't feel like he didn't think anything of your relationship because he did and probably still does but he's not him rn, he's a body that has been taken over by a very heartless personality. The ""you can't save what's been dead for years"" isn't something you should believe, it wasn't dead but when mania hits everything that we feel feels like we've been feeling it forever, we can't remember how we felt before and even if we can we can't ~feel~ the feeling anymore ya know? I'm really really sorry you're bring put through this and even though it would kill me if someone said this to my partner if I ever did this to him, don't let him back in if he comes back, this is a really fucked disease, this could happen again and you don't deserve to be hurt again.

You should fight very hard to not let him have that money, he's going to blow it very fast and most likely in a very stupid and impulsive way. 

Also keep in mind that when he comes out of this he might not remember anything that happened, mania can make our minds go black. 

And why he said all that bad stuff about you is because manic break ups are usually caused by the fact that every little thing that isn't how we want it gets insanely amplified until those are the only things we can think about.

Again I am so truly sorry that you have to go through this."
BipolarSOs,f4dy27d,t1_f4b6jqq,1571549206.0,"I'm so sorry, I remember psychosis and I thought literally any possible situation was about me, it's really really cringey to look back on now but at the time it all seemed so real and absolute, like how could this possibly not be about me? Mind set, mania blocks our prospective so much oh my God. I'm really sorry you have to deal with this and I'm sorry he's refusing to work on or probably even acknowledge that there is a problem.

Has it been constant psychosis since you married him? Or does it come and go?"
BipolarSOs,f499j21,t1_f4984fg,1571460057.0,I'm really sorry how long has it been really bad?
BipolarSOs,f498rub,t1_f48wwz3,1571459528.0,You're husband is very lucky to have you too. I'm really glad my post could lift your spirits a little bit.
BipolarSOs,f4989ie,t1_f48o4kq,1571459176.0,"It's really rough... She told me she hasn't liked me for a long time and that I was really annoying and thought the world revolved around me. But I feel like a lot of it was because mania kind of gives you tunnel vision and all you see is the bad and don't remember how you feel outside of that moment. But I also feel like I'm just saying that to make myself feel better...

Oh and even though she's apparently hated me for a along time she was still saying that she loved and missed me until the day she stopped responding to me."
BipolarSOs,f497uax,t1_f4916yz,1571458896.0,"I didn't write this because I'm unstable I wrote this because I felt the coldness and pain a love one caused me when she was manic and I hadn't realized just how horrible it is and now that I do I've been feeling horrible and I wanted say sorry to those of you who deal with this often. 

I take meds, I exercise, I do mindful meditation and I know how to control myself the majority of the time. I honestly don't understand how you got offensive, I'm genuinely sorry that anyone has to be put through this and I've only done this once and I would never do it again even if I went psychotic again, logic stays with me even if emotions don't, I try my best to be a joy to be around because it fucking crushes me to cause pain to others."
bipolar,f2fnach,t3_dd0cm3,1570220088.0,"I am, I also have a rare genetic form of kidney stones so I'm also scared to pass that on. I'm extremely scared of being pregnant and all of the hormones and how it'll affect me, post partum depression is also a big fear, and what if I get manic and want to go run away or I want to do a bunch of drugs and stop caring or even forget that I'm pregnant..
I'm very scared of the affect that me being bipolar will have on my child. I'm really scared of my child seeing my angry side and I don't want them to see me balled up in my room because I stopped feeling anything. 
There are a lot of things about having a child as someone with bipolar that are fucking terrifying and I'm just hoping it won't turn into a dangerous situation for my child's mental or physical health. It's honestly really hard to think about because I want kids and I want them to be biologically mine and I want to be the one to carry them but when you start thinking about the possibilities of what could go wrong... It gets really fucking scary and I haven't even thought about all the normal scary shit that comes with having children... I'm really scared, I still have a few years but, it's not really something you can just stop thinking about..."
