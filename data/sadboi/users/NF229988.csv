movies,fax8aui,t1_fawwolh,1576380158.0,For some reason this has put me off watching the movie. Everyone talks about how awful the movie looks so I’m kind of just avoiding watching it despite loving most Michael Mann films.
movies,f9siz0s,t1_f9shqqj,1575593378.0,I love that scene you can see the actor playing the Russian ambassador struggling to contain his laughter in the background.

movies,esmyah9,t1_esmtng9,1562117996.0,The Walking Dead sounds like it’s suffering a slow death. Every new season all I hear about is the viewers have dropped a record low.

Breaking Bad is the perfect example and if anything that show got better with each season, but what I like most is they knew when to finish. Not many producers would have stopped after five seasons especially considering it was arguably the most watched show at the time."

depression,ermq23i,t3_c2fuf3,1561033648.0,"It’s so much worst when your older as well. I’m 25 and although I work 35-40hrs a week I still feel like I’m such a burden and a disappointment to them, especially my dad.

My mum sort of knows I’ve got depression but she doesn’t know to the extent that I used to self half (recently relapsed) and frequently think about suicide. I’d love to be able to change things around for myself but I’ve wasted the last few years at a dead end job in an industry I dislike that’s really hurt potential for a career unless it’s entry level (even been rejected a handful of times in that area)."
