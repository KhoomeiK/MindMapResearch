The photo of her fingers yesterday: it surprisingly and sneakily bothered the shit out of me; a 30 year old woman well into recovery. I saw the lipstick on her fingers and was immediately taken back to a busy venue bathroom, crouched over a toilet, trying to throw up the four whole bites of sandwich I made myself eat in line before the show. It's loud enough I don't have to be that quiet. I look down and see a perfectly rounded kiss print hugging my middle fingers, like some horrific badge of honor. I spent all that time getting ready to end up hovering over a toilet crying. /End existential flashback.

I told myself ""maybe she uses that technique to rid her lips of excess product, I've seen people do something similar with a single finger/tissue etc..""  and I hope to God that's true. I really do. I really hope she was just blotting off. But it still took me there.
