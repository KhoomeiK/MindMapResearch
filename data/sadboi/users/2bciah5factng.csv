TooAfraidToAsk,fqkdhpa,t3_gjdnen,1589425033.0,"I'm also from a white, privileged perspective (although a member of the LGBTQ+ community), but my understanding is that, 1. it's not being used hatefully, and 2. it's an act of reclaiming the word and showing pride in who you are. Unless someone is suffering from internalized racism and intends to use it in a racist way, the n-word loses it's meaning as a slur (in that context, coming from an African American person). If both parties are from that oppressed population and are okay with it, the word is not hateful and, I would think, is perfectly okay. It's also, from my understanding, part of reclaiming the word. Some people may see it as taking away the harm a word can cause, as being proud of who you are and showing that it doesn't affect you (in that context, of course), or as a way to represent your community and culture. And I think the main reason it's not okay for other people to use it is because, historically, non-black people used it against black people, and it's not our word to use, as well as still having racist intent or meaning when coming from a non-black person.

Edit: This is not to say every member of an oppressed population is okay with being referred to as or hearing ""reclaimed"" slurs! They may have trauma associated with it from instances of racism/homophobia, they may not yet be comfortable enough with themselves to hear a reclaimed slur without feeling it as an insult or hate, or they may simply not see it as fully reclaimed or have any wish to be involved with those words, and it's important to respect that too and not pressure anyone to be comfortable with even ""reclaimed"" slurs and hateful things."

Repeatedly doing anything that you know makes a kid, or anyone, uncomfortable is a massive asshole move, even if they “should” have no problem with it. The question isn’t whether or not it’s okay to be uncomfortable at the word “penis,” it’s about how a parent should handle something that makes their kid uncomfortable and embarrassed. OP, YTA.

SuicideWatch,fq2sjzg,t3_ggnolc,1589059225.0,"Hey, I’m so sorry you’re going through this and I really relate to a lot of what you said. If you tell your therapist about your plan and make it clear that you are not safe, she is supposed to have you admitted to evaluated and then most likely sent to a hospital. She absolutely can overrule your mother as well, at least in most states. In fact, I’m many states in the US you have legal control over your mental health. If you can get yourself to a hospital (or call 911 and say that you are unsafe — that should work but not always), I believe you can admit yourself, without your mother’s permission. She also doesn’t have to know at first, in many places in the US they legally can not disclose your mental health information, even to your parents. Stay safe, if you ever want to talk I’m here."

If I were you, I would continue to officially document the things she says and does and get any proof you safely can. It also seemed like she was specifically targeting you and maybe your younger brother; does she say these things to them? Just to make sure she’s not trying to mess up your life or teach you things that will prevent you from being safe/successful outside of her care. If you’re over 13 in most states, you have control over your mental health care. Meaning, you can see a therapist, get medication, and do anything regarding mental health under your control and confidentiality. Even just talking a teacher or counselor at school could be the help you and your siblings need to get out of this situation, if you don’t know where to start.
