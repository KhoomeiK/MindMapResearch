Sometimes when I want to switch weapons I’ll hit the swap button multiple times to get to my desired weapon, but it hardly ever works in co-op when I’m not the host. It could be a similar problem but I’m not 100% sure."

They weren’t quite material looking, but almost more like ghosts. Only because I could see through them and I knew they weren’t really there... blah blah blah. 

After my eyes were closed I was shot off into their world where they showed me all sorts of cool stuff for a while. But when I had to leave again, they got really hostile and it kinda made me mad at them too haha.

It definitely didn’t surprise me though. I was expecting to meet something, just because i know how DMT is."
