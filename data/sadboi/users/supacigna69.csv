I am not a doctor and do not recommend the use of illegal substances."

selfimprovement,fnjlhpz,t1_fniw9nr,1587001480.0,Same here. I can go to bed so optimistic and wake up groggy and angry and depressed and work myself out of it. Haven’t always been like this but I usually am. The only time I haven’t is when i’ve been in love strangely enough.

seduction,fne3bl7,t1_fne2sd1,1586882314.0,"I think if it matters that much then you could change your diet, lift weights, grow facial hair. It’s not uncommon to feel the way you do. In the end it’s not really about looks, it’s mostly how you carry yourself. Everyone has their insecurities, myself included, but you have to grow to see past them for what is actually important. Michael Jackson is the greatest hit-maker of all time. Don’t take others words too seriously when the only words that matter are the ones you say to yourself."

TwoXChromosomes,fnaf4gq,t3_g0hmgi,1586796407.0,goo goo ga ga! enough of the lesser of two evils crap. this was made to look like reality tv. it’s all exaggerated and we’ll likely never know all the details of what actually went on. everyone on this show looks like a scumbag in their own way. who cares who was the lesser bad guy?
TwoXChromosomes,flwah52,t3_frg7wj,1585544237.0,good for you. reminds me a little of my father with my mother. he cooled off a lot over the years but now you know your worth. you’re not responsible for his actions. good luck.

depression,fk7h1c1,t3_fgnp3a,1583936287.0,"where do these thoughts come from? what behavior can change? people develop the life they enjoy. coming from someone who hated himself a few years ago, it’s a complicated arrangement of thoughts and feelings in your head that you can’t dissect on your own. go to therapy, be open minded, recognize where your thoughts are coming from, change behaviors. easier said than done but you only get one life and you and I both know doing the same thing won’t change anything. good luck."
AskMen,fj2v8ah,t3_farfql,1582955154.0,It’s a choice. You become aware of you behavior and the attachments behind them. Once you do this you step back and introduce new behaviors. Pretty soon you realize you don’t really miss drinking but always have the option to do so.
Drugs,fiu62hf,t3_f9mr4l,1582735764.0,One time I thought my dad was aggressively vomiting for a few hours. Turns out I was just hearing things. The mind likes to make up problems when you don’t have any. It’s called trippin for a reason!

dating_advice,f8a5fqx,t3_dzpb20,1574388223.0,"Read No More Mr Nice Guy and then Models by Mark Manson. Will give you the information you need to get past your neediness and recognize how to tailor your lifestyle. A lot of work from where you’re at now but if you want it bad enough you’ll read about the reality of your situation and get to a point where if you follow the steps you’ll get to where you want to be. Work on yourself and remember that you are the prize. Your happiness comes first. Sharing it with someone else is just a bonus. Getting on here and expressing your vulnerability is a good start, keep going."

socialskills,f4y64b7,t3_dm35fs,1571872755.0,"READ THIS. Therapy always helps but I suggest while you’re at it reading a book called Models by Mark Manson and No More Mr.Nice Guy! by Robert Glover. It sounds like a lack of self awareness. You’re too needy and you’re unaware of not only why you are where you are, but why your perception matters more than everyone else’s, not a woman’s. Women are amazing but you’re putting them on a pedestal. These books will help tremendously. Best of luck."
PsychedelicTherapy,f0pd11t,t3_d5x464,1568832156.0,I don’t know anything about anorexia but considering it is a mental health problem I would think it could help. Psychedelics helped cure my depression over a span of a few years. They are not a “fix all” but rather a learning tool to help you understand yourself better.
