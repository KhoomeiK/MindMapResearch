In reality my experience changes from moment to moment, though. I usually feel better or at least different after a while."

My sister works a second job in retail and well. She was almost hospitalized for a panic attack recently. It's not the same as you remember."

That husbandhousefamilycareer thing- it's not for everyone and that's ok! Sorry for the ramble, I feel strongly about this. I struggled with this for years."
AnxietyDepression,ewhh0yo,t3_coblda,1565407810.0,"Your gut feeling about other people can be wrong at times, just like anyone.
 If you aren't sure, check the facts. 
Are you physically safe? 
Are you able to endure the situation (like if you're standing in line for coffee... Something ordinary like that)? Can you comfort yourself in some way? 
Just start slow. Do what you need to do to get through the situation."
