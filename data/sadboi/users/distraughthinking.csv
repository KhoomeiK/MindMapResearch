He’s in school and has zoom calls everyday in the morning and works on homework for hours afterwards. I don’t have an responsibilities so I am extremely bored and craving attention, but, I stay quiet while he works out of respect. 

She’s an adult person and can entertain herself. I had asked my boyfriend to plan out time at the end of his day for us to sit and be close to one another, because I felt distant from him. She could’ve easily approached you in a similar fashion and told you her needs maturely, but she instead acted like a child.  NTA for those reasons."

I don’t feel horny, and I overthink things when we have sex, so why would I want to do it? Lately though I’ve realized that when I actually get into things I end up really enjoying myself. I just have to get over that initial hurdle and things end up being really great!"
coolguides,fpx2ri2,t1_fpnd2du,1588974572.0,I work at shoe store and I have probably 35+ pairs of shoes. Majority of them are very similar or they’re the same shoe in different colors. Most of my customers buy shoes out of necessity but a lot of the time it’s just people who really like to buy shoes. They add a lot to an outfit!

Skoliosexual is a new term which specifically means someone is attracted to non-binary or transgender people.

KindVoice,exrxzax,t1_exrxi4f,1566526941.0,"Have you tried opening up emotionally to the people around you? Like truly opening up? I just opened up to my boyfriend about a TON of things. I felt a sting of regret when I let myself be truly vulnerable to him but it did make me realize that someone is there to listen and that someone cares even if they don’t understand the struggles I am going through. I always held my feelings and emotions close to me but I suppose in some sense they were right, I did feel better spilling out my inner workings to someone. I am sorry you’re feeling this way. Even talking to him and feeling like I said, that loneliness subside, the issues still stand. I still hate myself, I still feel insecure, I still feel inadequate etc. I don’t know I’m rambling I am sorry.

Edit: I’m going through a bout of alcoholism at 20 years old and that definitely makes things 10x worse so props on you for removing that side of things."
KindVoice,exrxbxp,t3_cu4eam,1566526466.0,"Have you tried therapy? 

Life gets really rocky sometimes and it’s horribly tough to cope with it all. I constantly feel alone even with people around me. You can’t switch off negative thoughts like people assume you can. I am not very good at it myself but try to reassure yourself that what you’re thinking is simply intrusive irrational thoughts. You do have people around you, people who do care for you. I need therapy greatly and I’d recommend you find some professional help yourself. The relationships we have with people around us will never help us or fulfill us unless we are content with ourselves. We expect a cure all when we have company and the loneliness has subsided but the issues are still there at the end of the day. Not sure if that makes sense. I’m here to talk if you need someone to listen. We are all struggling in someway. I hope things get better for you!"

depression,evi9nha,t1_etsbgvq,1564539161.0,That’s what happens with me as well. I’ll be having a great day with the boyfriend. We’d spend time at the lake floating around and we’d drive listening to oldies. Then my brain wanders back to bad thoughts. I zone out and I’m staring into space just trapped in my head. My mood drops within a second and I’m sitting there quiet just thinking about shit. He immediately picks up on it and I just tell him I’m fine.
loseit,ev8sjht,t1_eufka8m,1564289946.0,God I hate pictures of me even though I look normal. It helps looking back on old ones to put things in perspective. I absolutely hate the way our minds operate but it’s very fascinating. I’m glad people have replied relating to this because sometimes I feel like I’m alone in this regard!
loseit,ev8sh8n,t1_eugzadr,1564289878.0,You’re right. It’s much deeper than weight loss. I have strong self loathing issues and that won’t go away by a physical fix. I need to work on my internal issues. Thank you!
loseit,ev8sfwh,t1_eug01jn,1564289839.0,I look so much at current photos that I become unaware of the vast change that occurred. My friend sent me a Snapchat memory from two years ago and my god my arms were humongous and my face was so full. Snapped me back into reality really quick and I was like holy shit props to me. That only lasts for so long. I’ll be patient! Congrats to you as well!
loseit,ev8sd58,t1_eufekqc,1564289760.0,"I am totally the same way! My coworker loaned me some clothes for work the next day after crashing at her place. She’s perfectly shaped in every way. I sat there completely degrading my body saying “that won’t fit me, don’t be silly” and then I fit in her size 0 jeans. I don’t really think they were size 0 but that’s what the tag said and none the less I fit into my tiny coworker’s clothes! 

It’s really easy to be filled with joy when shopping for your new body. I have something fit and look amazing on me and I’m ecstatic. Then one thing looks awful and I’m back to hating my body. 

Big props to you on the weight loss! I bet you look absolutely amazing and let’s both feel fabulous walking into a store knowing there is clothes out there for us!

I appreciate you and let me know if there is anything I can do for you too. I’ll try and stay positive :)"
loseit,ev8s47u,t1_euf1rru,1564289502.0,Thank you so much for your message. I’m also going to seek out help for the dysmorphia. We are both completely healthy yet it seems as if it we have tons of work left to do. The human mind is weird. Congrats on the weight loss and best of luck to you!
loseit,ev8s0bq,t1_eug43ik,1564289392.0,"Jesus, this is all too relatable. I’ve been that “big-boned” friend all my life and always hated my body growing up. My body has become much more womanly and even after losing weight but I’m still like ? That didn’t solve shit? 

I didn’t lose weight exercising but it’s obviously proven to have benefits in all ways possible so I should really invest my time in exercising! Thank you!"
loseit,ev8rwqp,t1_eufcapg,1564289292.0,I am really obsessive when it comes to my weight. I worry about every single pound gained even when it’s a normal day to day fluctuation. I think it’s 100% something that should be addressed with a therapist. I’m looking into seeking additional help for a negative outlook. Someone who can help teach me tools to steer away from self deprecating thoughts. It’s a night and day difference between my current and past self but I don’t always remember that.
loseit,ev8rrh6,t1_eufapb0,1564289143.0,"That’s so much weight though! We should be proud of ourselves. It’s a huge achievement and accomplishment. 

I think some days I truly recognize how different I look, especially when I look back on old photos. Other days I pick apart all the flaws in my body. Weight loss has left with me with looser skin and it makes me sad to see my tummy in certain angles. It’s hard to recognize that my appearance now is a vast improvement from my past self. 

I just didn’t expect to still be unhappy with my body after all the weight being dropped."
loseit,ev8rk4z,t1_euf8hgl,1564288940.0,"Sorry for the late reply! 

I am completely focused on my appearance and my self image that it is ridiculously hard to develop other important qualities in my life. I doubt my relationship with my boyfriend and find it hard to see what he sees in me. So you’re right, it’s insecurity that doesn’t stem from the weight loss. It’s an ongoing struggle.

I’m transitioning in life right now. I moved out of my parents’ house 11 months ago and I’m still trying to figure out adulthood. I think focusing on beneficial activities and setting goals will help but it’s just hard. 

My appearance and mental state kind of consumes my life, you know?"

sex,eszwlja,t1_eszpn7e,1562369036.0,We kind of skip foreplay because we get so hot and heavy and then it’s easiest just to slip into missionary. Yesterday he put my legs on his shoulders and fucked me that way. I’ve always loved that position and it was very random on his part so I really was digging it. We’ve talked about spicing up positions so maybe tonight will be more adventurous! Good to hear I’m not alone with the inability to do certain positions. His dick is really sensitive so that definitely contributes to the difficulty!
sex,eszvdet,t1_eszoyw7,1562368479.0,I have never really done reverse cowgirl so I feel very inexperienced doing it or I guess you could say insecure. It’s a lot visually and if I am doing the position awkwardly such as poor rhythm or his dick slipping out I just think it would be a visual mess.
sex,eszuzcc,t1_eszrrrk,1562368297.0,"The froggy position is so awkward. It’s really successful but I feel like some primal caveman going to town in that position. Maybe I should just lean forward, laying on him basically, and have him fuck me from underneath. I’ve tried leaning forward and leaning backwards using my hands to support my weight to make it comfortable for him but nothing works. Maybe a talk is in order to understand the pain. I haven’t tried circular motions either so maybe that would help so it’s not bending so much."
