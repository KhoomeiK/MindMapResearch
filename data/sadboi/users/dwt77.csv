I don't have many complaints-- I think my biggest disappointment would probably be in the price of the footswitch and the fact that it isn't included in the purchase of the amp. Even if the amp was 50 bucks more expensive or sold in some kind of a package that would be more reasonable to me. Also the Tone Studio software is a bit challenging to get worked out on your computer at first, and there are some things you can do in those initial stages that could actually severely damage your amplifier. I had a big scare at first because I couldn't get the amp to accept the folders, and then I wasn't sure how to fix it or back out of it once I was that far in to the process. My computer kept identifying the amp as a photo device. It was just a frustrating and somewhat stressful  initial process... Once I got it worked out, it was great though. Also I wish the Tone Studio itself had more to offer in terms of pre-arranged patches from Boss Studio and maybe like a forum for all Katana users to connect through Boss and download/upload their own patches would be nice. It is awesome as is with [guitarpatches.com](https://guitarpatches.com) etc ...But I'd love to see more support for user creativity and connection directly through the Tone Studio itself! Or even if Boss rolled out some specially designed patches for a small fee, I might be interested in that too... I had a pre-conceived notion going in that it was all somehow going to be available right through that Tone Studio. Didn't realize how deep the rabbit hole would be. If you have a brain that has to know all the little details this amp can go from being tons of fun to an endless game of minutiae and trying to understand all the nuances and details right away!  I should have spent the first month or two just playing with it on the on board settings and not even bothering with the other stuff! But my brain has to comprehend and know everything immediately... And the instructions on this thing only gives you the tip of the iceberg of what is going on! Learn from my mistakes....Just have fun with it and don't make it stressful!"

Tone Studio can be super tricky to install--- One thing that helped me that they don't mention on the site--- My computer was fussy at first (Windows). I had to shut down and restart to get it to sync up correctly with the amp a few times at first. It was trying to read the Katana as some kind of a photo device. Also when you go to put the proper folders in the amp to update it, you have to actually go inside the folder and drag the files individually in to the amp. I kept trying to drag the whole folder and that would not work for some reason. Little things sometime can be the most frustrating.

When building a sound--- I've heard two things--- Max out Volume and use Master to adjust the level or max out Master and use volume for level. I do the first one because that's what I've heard on multiple reviews of the amp on Youtube. But some people say the opposite. Still haven't gotten total clarity on that one though.

Someone gave me a tip to lower 16k by 6 db in eq and 8k by 2 db as a way to dial out the high end a little. What I've been doing so far is to boost my bass to 65 or 70 and take my treble back to around 35 or 40 ... This seems to give it a fuller sound and remove some of the shrillness.

For Strat blues -- blues driver boosted to around 25 on crunch ... volume max and play with gain to get what you want. Treble backed off a bit. Mid dialed back to 40, but the presence control up around 50. A touch of reverb...

Also if you go to [guitarpatches.com](https://guitarpatches.com) you'll find a ton of good options in there for free for just about any sound you want!

Also--- This amp is very easy to get caught up in the little details, and just forget to actually play! The first two weeks, I went on down the Tone Studio rabbit hole because I had to understand everything right off the bat... If you can help it, just play and have fun with it for awhile first!

If that patch is close, maybe start by dialing back things before upping things too?  Treble is a fickle thing on Katana or at least in my experience so far... A little really makes a big difference.

Just guessing here... Just noticed no one responded yet. 

Also I got a tip in a forum I'm part of that says to lower 16K by \~6 dB and 8K by \~2dB in the EQ as a general rule to dial out the ""shrillness"" that some with Katanas hear. That might be a good template for you to try out as a base line for finding a tone. I haven't experimented with it much yet.

insomnia,fk2vfjz,t3_fflxfu,1583810118.0,"Yes. What I have worked out for myself is a weekly sleep gameplan ...  Every night I take something different, running the gamut from prescription pills to herbs/vitamins/minerals to things like Benadryl covering all points in between. I do this to try to avoid the dreaded tolerance to any particular thing. If I notice the tolerance happening, I will take whatever it is out of my rotation for a month. This usually resets me enough to let it be effective again. I have to constantly tweak the plan, and move things around. Right now for instance on my CBD/melatonin/Valerian Root nights, I'm sleeping way less and often compensating by taking too much melatonin which is bad for you long term. So I have to figure something else out for awhile. Maybe remove one of those elements and replace it with something a little stronger.

I feel depressed about it. But it is the reality I am faced with. Also this is compounded by the fact that my spouse doesn't take insomnia seriously or have a lot of empathy or understanding for what this problem does to me mentally and physically. So not only do I struggle daily with this issue, I am made to feel like I'm an asshole for the way it impacts my life.

Let the feelings be what they are instead of resisting them. Sometimes with anxiety the way out is through. Instead of resisting you say---Ahh okay ...Here is my old friend anxiety. Embrace it with open arms as an experiment. See yourself as being somehow above the experience ...Viewing from outside of it in a neutral place of acceptance. Notice the environment --- Your surroundings. The sights and sounds and the feelings on your skin... The clothes on your back. The ground beneath your feet. The air ...How does it smell in the room? What are you hearing? Ground in to the senses and not the noise happening in the brain ... It is a form of mindfulness, but it happens slightly outside of yourself.... Zoom out like you're operating a camera overhead and see yourself down there panicking from your hot air balloon. Hope this helps."
insomnia,fjipnep,t1_fjio32t,1583372904.0,"Wow--- I'm really surprised to read this actually. I guess I kind of knew instinctively somehow that I needed these things because I take all of the things you mention almost every day.  I'll probably start upping my Tumeric though. I only do that a few times a week.  I exercise and do guided meditations, though I need to be more consistent with both.  Thanks so much for the helpful input! I really appreciate your time and energy in posting this."
AskReddit,fjhven2,t3_fdbdik,1583355769.0,Today a girl literally lumbered (head down) across the street without looking as I was moving full speed in her direction. (It wasn't a crosswalk.)  I'm sure I may have come closer in the past... But that's the one freshest on my mind.
BossKatana,fjagijv,t3_fbqjaf,1583173029.0,Does anyone possibly have the default delay settings or maybe (I know this is asking a lot) could take a picture of the settings --- Like within the delay part ...All the little nuanced settings within the delay itself?
BossKatana,fj7wd5u,t1_fj6ebgd,1583099721.0,Thanks... Yeah-- I've been trying to be super careful. I really think this is a legitimate case of the software having a mind of its own. Also my bad--- I left my usb hooked up to the computer overnight before this glitch happened. That won't happen again. I'm thinking I'll just back up everything to Tone Studio and factory reset it. Just bums me out because I was soooo close to having it all be exactly what I wanted!
BossKatana,fj5cl59,t3_fbdyg2,1583029476.0,"You might start cheap and see what you think of the Joyo Vintage pedal...  I just got that, and it took a little getting used to, but it adds a nice full retro chunk sound that isn't super over saturated. Mixes well with the crunch and low gain. (max volume)"
AskReddit,fiolm5r,t3_f8rn5x,1582585643.0,"Went in to the room and turned on the lights ... No less than sixty to eighty roaches scattered and hid. Immediately went to the front desk, and checked out. That is not an exaggerated number."
nba,fij7eyv,t3_f83z3a,1582436769.0,"There are special moments where this weird time glitch happens in basketball...   The timing of a shot or a pass or a dunk perfectly lines up in some artistic synchronicity that transcends the game itself. People defy even their own super human/basketball abilities, and the laws of physics (or something) bend just a tiny bit for them. A perfect moment. That's what this is."
AskReddit,fiit2za,t3_f80qhl,1582426227.0,"Still not in the ""former"" category--- But when he didn't invite me to his wedding that seemed like a pretty big red flag that something was askew. Also when his douche'y boyfriend judged me to my face about an extremely personal situation, that he clearly didn't understand, but  felt the need to be an asshole about... His reaction to that tipped me off that those opinions were actually his true feelings too.  He is just fully immersed in the cop lifestyle, and they just have this alpha dog thing mixed with this uber judgy thing... We grew in to different people. Also his true colors have come out multiple times when he drinks too much. 

I think he just has some sort of strange loyalty thing because of our past or something. Like he feels obligated for some reason to pretend to give a shit once or twice a year. I actually tried to end our friendship in the past, but he glossed everything over. Likes to pretend like I am his best friend. Maybe in his head I am. Truth is I haven't talked to him about anything super real in my life since the situation with the boyfriend. That was well over 7 years ago. When you are going through heavy (real life) situations that's when you find out who your friends really are. I paid attention and learned from it. 

This got long... Sorry. Feels good to vent about it because I never have to anyone."
BossKatana,fiioi47,t3_f7a2i7,1582423975.0,"Something I stumbled on to a few years back .... Dan Electro French Toast pedal with the Octave switch engaged can really get you close to his Band of Gypsys octave sound. They're pretty cheap if you wanted to add a funky pedal to your Katana. I'm planning on doing the same thing. Can't find anything that quite sounds like it through the Tone Studio.  It is a distinctive sound you're looking for, and this pedal can get you there. It isn't a particularly great pedal otherwise... But that effect is nice.  It is like this raunchy crunchy octave thing like Hendrix does --- Look at 6:35 or so on Who Knows off the Band of Gypsys album. It basically gives you that sound if you dial in your distortion right."
BossKatana,fiin016,t3_f7nlev,1582423511.0,"Would love this as well! Especially something that approaches his sound on Ghosts. Love that lead tone on that song so much! It is kind of like a Stevie Ray tone, but a little more of a heavy edge. One of my favorite guitar solos of all time."

nba,fhxjtn1,t3_f53119,1581955998.0,I legitimately believe Lebron hit the glass a millisecond before that hand hit the backside of the ball. But it is just about impossible to tell. I think the benefit of the doubt should have gone to the initial call on the floor because that is totally inconclusive.
nba,fhwpmyt,t3_f538t1,1581924362.0,Like he said... They just wanted to get to 157 first. That singular focus is what led him to greatness.
BossKatana,fhwi73g,t1_fhv78j4,1581916596.0,"I love the amp, and agree with you for the most part...   It would just be super cool if we had a display panel with some arrow buttons or something so we could just do a lot of this stuff right on the amp itself. Especially with the expression pedal! Even just a simple expression pedal button on the amp so we could use it as a basic wah pedal without having to ""assign"" it to anything in the Tone Studio... 

An Iphone compatible app to control the studio would be nice too."
BossKatana,fhwhmqy,t3_f4ylya,1581916102.0,Thanks for the tips! Gonna try this out.

nba,fhrpaif,t3_f4l3ie,1581833317.0,"A reporter was saying it was a legit miscue between the judges where they wanted a tie, but messed up somehow.  But that is really no excuse. Somebody higher up the chain should have fixed that travesty right on the spot. Somebody higher up the chain STILL needs to fix it! 

Just fix it NBA... Give AG a trophy! Any trophy will do!"
BadChristianPodcast,fhrogrh,t3_f47au8,1581832471.0,"The chemistry of the 3 was definitely special. They're all really interesting people individually too, but I do miss how they balanced out each other's quirks. Matt and Joey especially seemed to be good for each other in that sense... They seemed to hold each other in check a little bit where things wouldn't go too far down the over-analysis or over-spiritual rabbit hole-- Then Toby would always come in and knock it out of the park with a funny insight, usually at Joey's expense, but sometimes at Matt's too... That was the magic recipe, I think.  Having those two who were in a little bit of tension and the comic relief to pull it back from that edge. That and just Joey's realness about his mental health struggles. 

 I'm glad they're all still creating and doing stuff regardless. But yeah--- It is an adjustment from a listener standpoint. The show isn't dead, but it is a jarring change."
nba,fhhuiq2,t1_fhhtthd,1581612021.0,I'm not doubting Lebron as a player!  But his high work load for all these years is the exact reason I'm wondering if it is sustainable in multiple back to back games!
nba,fhhsqvg,t3_f35az3,1581611021.0,Lebron will have to be this every time for them to win in the playoffs though... I think that will be the question. Can he leave it all on the floor and still have enough to come back in 2 or 3 days and do the same thing all over again.
aww,fhhrrkf,t3_f3809h,1581610455.0,"I am seeing looks of slight trepidation followed by resignation. I think the dog is tolerating it, but I don't think the dog is necessarily in happy snuggle land. My dog gives my cat the same looks when she snuggles with her. A lot of times she'll even give half-hearted growls at her, but the cat ignores her and lays beside her anyway. The tail wags could be about fear just as much as happiness."
