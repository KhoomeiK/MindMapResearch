A side of wasting so much energy mentally conversing with those ppl who were apart of those memories and/or forging a MUCH better outcome in your head , in an attempt to appease your unsatisfied ego. 

Yeah, gets me every time."

It's really hard (especially with the coronavirus going on) I'm hoping all of this passes and i can work a job (and keep it ) and get the things I want.
