powerrangers,fmak83o,t3_dgnyvt,1585897000.0,"I'd do a sequel to the 2017 movie, and tweak certain elements. I personally like the suits they went with in the final product, but also after having seen some fan designs and some early test designs, i agree they could have looked a little closer to the show. I'd also have the sequel handle the green with evil arc, but in its own way. I'd have it so Tommy comes across rita's coin and joins the team soon after, but the twist is that the coin is corrupted with a lot of Rita's left over magic, so the more Tommy uses the coin, it warps his mind little by little until he becomes dependent on it like a drug and it causes him to do things he wouldn't usually do. This would cause the other rangers to have to separate him from the coin, and after taking it they have to purify it and erase any traces of Rita from it. By purifying it, the coin turns from green to white, making Tommy the white ranger. And since the first movie already served to get a lot of lore and character introductions out of the way, this movie could have a bigger emphasis on action while still taking time to focus on the rangers and their personal lives and showing how they're all adjusting to life as super heroes. Since Billy and Trini were my favorite rangers in the 2017 movie, I'd give them more scenes together and have them develop and brother/sister dynamic. Just overall I'd try to make some elements a little more lighthearted than the first movie, but still keep the stakes high"
