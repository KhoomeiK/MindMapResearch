I can’t even focus on school, and if I try to sit and do school work I just want to eat instead to distract myself. So I wander to the kitchen for a “snack” and usually just binge. And don’t end up getting my work done. Last week I had a limit 600 calories and felt good about it and felt like I was done binging uwu but now here I am again. I want to stop this but it just keeps happening because I’m depressed and ugly and have no self control"

BadMUAs,fpvyr55,t3_gfs4y6,1588954235.0,"But how do people find their shade? I’m 16 and I’ve tried about 3 different foundations beforewhich is already too many, and I’m too poor to afford to keep buying them over and over until I get a match anymore. None of them have matched me very well, but I had to use them anyway because it’s all I have. I remember the first foundation I had I thought it was okay at the time, but now I’ve realized that it was soo light and I probably looked like ghost. The next one I bought was also too light, AND it was very dry and irritated my skin. I bought a new one thinking it would match (I held it up to my skin to check at the store) and when I took it home I put I on my skin and it got darker once it dried! Apparently it oxidized? And turned orange? It’s all been a waste of money. I’ve just been using the only ones that I have and try to mix them together (still doesn’t match but it’s slightly better ), but people either point out that I look too white or that I look orange. How do I find one that matches like wth? And I know that you can get matched by a makeup artist. But I’m way too introverted and socially anxious to have a stranger right up in my bare face."

My face isn’t very attractive and I don’t have nice clothes. I’m still trying to get better though despite the bad circumstances. I know I need to be more positive and I’m working on that.
