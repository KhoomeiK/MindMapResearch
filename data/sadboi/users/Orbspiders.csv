Last night Boris discovered that he was lousy. I had to shave his armpits and even then the itching did not stop. How can one get lousy in a beautiful place like this? But no matter. We might never have known each other so intimately, Boris and I, had it not been for the lice.

Boris has just given me a summary of his views. He is a weather prophet. The weather will continue bad, he says. There will be more calamities, more death, more despair. Not the slightest indication of a change anywhere. The cancer of time is eating us away. Our heroes have killed themselves, or are killing themselves. The hero, then, is not Time, but Timelessness. We must get in step, a lock step, towards the prison of death. There is no escape. The weather will not change.'

I hear the same repeating patterns that infuriate me, but my wife hears nothing but white noise. I've had the same experience with any type of constant/confusing sound. While I was staying in the rainforest the animal/bug sounds during the night were so pervasive that I could swear I heard constant conversations and such coming from the forest, but no one else could hear them. It was difficult to convince myself that it was truly nothing of concern.

Not necessarily related, but I absolutely can't handle sounds of phones ringing, whether they are in music, television, etc. Phones ringing unanswered make me impossibly uncomfortable."

Probably just my own interpretation, but I see a wall of darkness coming at me with a tiny green barrier attempting to thwart the onslaught of madness. It's the firehose of insanity that we are all experiencing and the flimsy protections we're able to put up to stave it off.
