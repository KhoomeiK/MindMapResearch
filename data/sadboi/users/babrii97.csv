My husband had to go straight back to work so here I was hardly able to walk trying to care for dogs and a baby.  I had a super rough experience and was in a lot of pain for 2 weeks and could not even bend over, sit with out a donut cushion or walk long. The first few months for me was not able to sleep longer than 2 hours at a time. Postpartum is really hard on the woman mentally you get so tired that the prime thing you are able to do is just take care of the baby. It is something you cannot fully understand until you go through it. Especially if you are half asleep carrying a baby and your dog just lays in the middle of the floor. I was always so scared of tripping holding the baby. I was so tired postpartum I can't even explain it and I had awful insomnia for years. It is a mix of no sleep and hormone changes"
