IAmA,fq283yg,t3_ggjj2s,1589053686.0,"Hi! Thanks for the AMA. I've been feeling as panicky with anxiety as never before during this pandemic. I know it is because restrictions are being lifted and life is going back to ""normal"". But it took me so long to feel ok during quarantine that I am now fearing the ""normal"". There will be SO MUCH to do, compensating for time lost, many things in my calendar pilling up already!
Is this a concern that mental health workers should have after the pandemic - the return to normal life hitting you like a freight train? I don't even know if this is normal it's just what I've been feeling. 
If so, will we adjust back the same way as we did in the beginning? 
Thanks!"

Their mother, Lori Vallow, refuses to explain what happened to her kids - are they alive? Safe somewhere? As the investigation went on, there were a lot of deaths surrounding Lori and she ended up marrying her 5th husband, Chad Daybell. Chad Daybell is a writer that believes in the end of the world. So does Lori Vallow, his recent wife.   
Many people that escaped the ""bubble""/cult that Lori cultivated have spoken publicly (including her first son) but until now there were no comments from the Vallow family.

IAmA,fokxiw4,t1_fokqj88,1587850834.0,"I don't know if this will help you in any way but that's what happened to me. Diagnosed early (20?) with BPD after 5 years with my psychiatrist because it was/is a label that no one seems to understand. It was a relief to be honest because I educated myself on BPD and understood that I wasn't the ""monster"" I thought I was. 
Fast forward 15 yrs and the *only* symptom of BPD is dissociation and bursts of anger which might even be related to other dx's.
For me it was the hardest thing I ever went through. Many years with trial and error with medication, many failed therapies and therapists, hospitalisation, etc. 
In my opinion (theory) what happens is that, if you have the adequate help, you will be self-aware enough to start ""stopping yourself"" from doing what BPD triggers in you. Also, as you age, most people will want safety, a routine, a steadier life and what happened to me was that after many failed relationships (romantic and not) I got myself so tired that my mind seemed to calm down because, as you know, BPD is relentless and tiring so I did reach a ""breaking point"" - a very hard one at that but it seemed to help.
Now I do care about myself more. I could've tried to stop meds and therapy but I will forever need them so I'm still on both. 

Find the *right* therapist and therapy and it can make a world of a difference. Learn a lot about it so you can look at BPD as an outsider and your brain will start evaluating your reactions and you'll refrain from repeating them. Get workbooks for BPD and do them on your own. And stop any contact with people that trigger you or are not helping. That was a big step for me, cutting people of. You might spent a lonely long time but it is worth it. You will find your true self I promise. X"

And it's not that this choice is something that will work as a miracle for everyone, it's just that people should know ""It's OK to sleep separate, if sleeping together is hurting your sleep don't be ashamed or feel like a bad person for wanting your bed or bedroom"".

Have you ever tried staying with her until she falls asleep and then you go for your bed? 
Some days my SO needs me there until he falls asleep and I'll stay. He has the advantage of the better sleep because I guess his mind tells him ""she's here"" until he wakes up. Of course he knows I'm not spending the whole night there - I don't just disappear for him to wake up confused lol. I've found that helpful in those nights when he truly does go to sleep a lot better with me! Both of us take sleeping pills but during sleep it's like a wrestling match so it's not safe. 

I'm sorry for your situation, I can only imagine that you feel guilty but you shouldn't - try being there until she falls asleep and see how it goes. Is she on any medication or any other thing that might help? Meditation, melatonin, white noise or whatever makes her sleep better? 
Being an insomniac all my life I can tell you that what helped me the most (even more than the truly KO meds) was using a weighted blanket.

I can straight up tell if you will be a creep or not by the way you are standing there... I might make the occasional mistake, but I'd rather not have reasons to ""hate men"". I know it's maybe too subtle to explain but we, as women (but I'm talking on my experience and women I know) are always kind of on defense-mode every time we're approached: the handsome put-together clean guy might just whisper something repulsive and rude and maybe the guy that looks homeless will treat us kindly - you'd be surprised...

I'd say, before you open your mouth, make sure you are not aggressive when approaching any woman/girl. This is hard to explain, so I'll do it with my own examples:

Guy A - the most handsome, confident guy, smiling, puffed chest, turns to me and stays right in front of me or just invades my circle of privacy for that millisecond before saying something - I might be there to listen but I'll already have one foot on the go.

Guy B - half a smile, hands behind his back (I've noticed this is one that really lets my guard down in a good way and these guys never were creeps), stays outside my comfort zone but tries to engage without making too much eye contact - I will be there, I will be curious, I will feel respected that you don't want to invade my space and in return I will make it easier for you.

I think it boils down to respect. General respect between human beings. I feel that Guy B might have less of a chance of being a creep. It's very subtle but because body language comes way before anything is said, I leave my 2 cents here."

And you know what? My friends with kids all say the same - it's about ""me time"" and also ""couple time."" It has nothing to do with how much you love your kid or if you're a bad/good Mom. NOTHING. Simple fact - you might feel extraordinary love for your kid but HATE and resent all the changes that kid created, all of them new and all of them affecting every second you live! You're right - that IS torture.

I applaud you for venting out loud because I know damn well loads of people are feeling the exact same but they'll never reach for help out of fear of being judged. But you know what? Those parents, the ones who are driving themselves crazy will absolutely damage their kids if they don't put THEIR OWN mental health in the first place, even before the kid. If you're not ok, your kid will not be.

So, again, congrats - I am sure your kid will be fine, you have a lot of self-insight which is rare these days and very much needed. You take care of yourself as others have suggested and soon enough you'll feel less and less of a pressure until it fades away. 

I'm reminded of a friend of mine with 2 teenage boys that to this day regrets having them - and she is the best mother I've ever met. The love and caring for the kids has nothing to do with the fact that you might feel ""you can't escape"" and yes, you will lose a bit of yourself in the process.

I'm excellent at it but I hate it and it's exhausting) so dealing with people walking around with high levels of stress create anxiety in me. I stay away as much as possible from those situations or try to distract myself as much as possible but for some reason I must have a ""therapist face"" because everyone confides in me... which is OK and I like to help but oh boy, it sucks my energy out... And honestly this society is ridiculous, there are so many things that could easily be done differently to make things run smoother while lowering the stress levels - I don't feel I'm fit to be part of it... So I'm more of an observer, this rush is not for me.

I just love the silence, no cars and beeps and words around, the stillness, maybe? If I could freeze in time I'd be in there.

Honestly I am glad it was so awful because it made me super aware of what I wanted from any partner. I got to be very picky and didn’t care for sex at all but then you find someone who fulfills both love and lust and you’ll appreciate it more because you can compare it to a bad experience!

AskReddit,f0q0ih3,t1_f0oq5sx,1568851528.0,"You’re def not alone... The amount of exhaustion is directly correlated with how many hours I will roll in bed until I fall asleep. The more exhausted I am the harder insomnia hits. I recently had one of the more exhaustive weeks in my whole life (not to mention chronic pain/illness with fatigue) and for 2 whole nights I just did not sleep... even with sleeping pills. I was buzzing inside, adrenaline maybe? Diazepam, flurazepam, zolpidem, you name it - I’ve tried them all. And all the others - no screens, bed for sleep only, meditation and all natural stuff. 

The only thing that works is propofol but I’m not filthy rich nor suicidal... it’s 2 am and I can sense that after a day of being half-asleep all day long I’ll probably fall asleep around 5/6am. My current attitude is “so what?” because I work freelance and can sleep/wake up whenever so instead of getting frustrated I tell myself “Don’t sleep, fine do whatever”. But I feel I’m missing out on so much especially with a SO that has a “normal” sleep.

If there was just ONE thing I could change about my life it would be SLEEP. Goddamn those propofol experiences were the best sleep ever..."

raisedbynarcissists,et4y34k,t1_et0zahl,1562459948.0,"That is exactly the narc thing - they hit a nerve that throw us into a guilt trip/self-hatred spiral.
Always. Very few communications from my part as well but I am very very careful about what I say and how I say them - I speak in a low calm voice, I am nice and respectful and try to give minimal info, just enough to keep them “up to date”. The thing is... Having a narc parent is extremely hard because you are here because of them. As much as my N parent is who they are, I will always think “they gave me my life”. So of course it’s hard to balance the idea of “I exist because of them” and “I hurt because of them”. They give life and grief, joy and pain. 

My N parent is much nicer at low contact but I won’t let that trick me as it did before. Like you said, they are less awful and sometimes even normal but... it’s a trap. They don’t change - it’s brain chemistry, the whole personality. I think the worst is all the ups and downs while we don’t disconnect because I thought hundreds of times “phew, they changed”... what a waste of time.

I wouldn’t say I am stronger - I just have more solid barriers around me in every way possible. Many times I am saddened and feel this sort of “maybe it can change...?” moments but sticking to therapy, talking to friends and asking them directly if I should approach or not because “they’re being nicer” are my strength. If needed, write down all the worst things about them - and how many times you gave them a chance, it helps a lot in not falling back to giving your mind any slip up! I could have *never* do it alone - I owe it to finally open up to some people that protect me from falling into any traps. You have to have someone, one person is enough that will alert you and remind you. Shame and guilt are the only reason I kept it to myself, after opening up it worked wonders. Hope you have a great day and stay strong - you are very well aware of the sugar coating and the dangers of falling back so I know you’re doing fine :)) lots of love from someone going through the same and fighting to not feel guilt anymore"
raisedbynarcissists,et4warw,t1_et18wz5,1562458841.0,"Oh that empty promise came out in every tantrum, weekly thing. It was what made me disconnect - after the last threat of this kind I pointed at the door and said “Do it outside I don’t feel like cleaning; just crash the car into some wall or something - here, I’ll open the door for you, go ahead”... then for some reason (probably adrenaline) I started laughing and shrugging my shoulders. I wish I’d reacted that way a long time ago because it worked wonders in my/our case - Narc was baffled by my reaction and kinda froze. They were used to my lifelong reaction of crying and trying to calm them down with a hug and won the “victim award of the day”. This time, due to therapy and having a new support system I just reacted in a way not even I was prepared for - it just came out and I thought “wow I’m an awful human...”.
Serves the N well - threw them off rails and they were confused af, went quiet and retreated to a room. And off I went. Never looked back. Interestingly, I maintain superficial contact and have visited a couple times but they seem to respect me more and try to please me after what I did and said O.o
I wish all people who get out of this situation the same result. Don’t know if this type of changed behavior after distancing is normal but I don’t dare fall in the trap of thinking “they changed, it’s ok now”. Nope, never. I’m nice and respectful and I keep in touch. That’s it."

Don’t fall in the trap of harming yourself - it’s what they want. To be their only source of every emotion, good or bad. Your emotions are yours, learn how to distinguish emotions from thoughts or emotions from reactions. You can have the emotions and either rationalize them or react in a positive way - turning the game. You are worth a lot more and you owe yourself a lot more than to follow the path someone else forged for you, especially if it’s one that makes you lash out on yourself. You are a separate entity - try to imagine a bubble of any color surrounding you and creating a barrier outside of your body - this trick helped me a lot, I can visualize it by now when I need it. Other times I just draw a lot (throwing paint) or just write furiously for hours. There are sooooo many ways for you to get it out without the self harm (I know sometimes it seems it’s the only release possible) so just TRY and unfocus with something ridiculous or entertaining.

I cannot yet unplug completely and maintain everything on a very superficial level now which seems to work ok - it’s like the person respects me more now because they realized I don’t need them for the first time? I will wonder for as long as I live which mask is the real one. It’s not like there is no empathy and they adopt behavior they see on other people. I’ve seen them going through real grief and depression so there’s something very human and ... real there - it’s really more like having double personalities or DID...

How could I be aware and conscious and felt hate and resentment to the point I didn’t consider him a father but only after one very specific day after a “normal” tantrum (threats of suicide and it’s going to be my fault lol Was used to it for all my life) and it only clicked on that particular instance/day? Again looking back... wow. No wonder I’m a mess. Recovering though and finding myself picking up pieces of myself... What was also amazing was finding beautiful caring people and a whole new life just because I “unplugged” as if suddenly I attracted good things and people... those are my family now. Still feel sorry for him because he is two-faced and one of those faces is of a very fragile, self-conscious, lonely as F and low self esteem man... the other is the opposite. I don’t know which one is “true” guess I’ll never know. I feel sorry for him as a human to have those characteristics like any other person with anti social disorders and stuff it’s not their fault for their broken brain but damn :/ I feel you, not alone x"
