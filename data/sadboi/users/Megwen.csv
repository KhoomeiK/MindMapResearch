I agree that sexualizing children is a real problem, but it's not connected to adults having open sex lives. And in fact, kids have *always* had sexual urges themselves *long* before being ready to have relations with others, and if we want them to grow up having healthy sex lives we need to be able to talk about it in an open and honest way.
