homeowners,fqqm27p,t3_gk9w37,1589567890.0,"I bought a house two and a half years ago with a pool. I wasn’t looking for a pool, but the house was too nice to pass up. 

The pool was the only part of the house that was behind on maintenance so my first two summers were a lot of work and expensive (first thing I had to do was replace the liner). 

This’ll be my third summer, and now that I’m used to it and have invested in some equipment it’s getting to be more fun. 

Biggest bang for the buck (for me anyway) have been getting a quality pool robot, new filter, variable speed pump, lots of outdoor storage (love my deck boxes) and I cannot overstate the importance of a couple good quality umbrellas (Irish family). 

At this point it’s more like maintaining a huge fish tank. Variable speed pump once programmed can be left on all summer and forgotten about, twice a week I toss the robot in before bed and pull it out on my way into work in the morning. Once a week I put chlorine shock and some triple tabs in it. Every other week I take a sample of water to the pool store and sometimes they’ll have a recommendation for rebalancing and it’ll cost 50-100 bucks if i don’t already have what I need but if I’m diligent about the other things those little gotchas are less frequent and costly (before I got the new pump, filter and robot I was spending much more on chemicals, now it’s easier to keep clean and so I need to mess around with it less). 

I know if I didn’t have the pool to spend money on, I would have bought a used sports car off Craigslist or something stupid like that. And my mom told me the thought of sitting out by the fire table I keep on the patio near the shallow end this summer is the happy thought getting her through quarantine, which makes me smile. 

I don’t even go in it that much, but I love having my friends and family come visit. 

So I guess what I’m saying is, if you want to enjoy it you will. If you want to hate it... you will. 

Either way, try not to think too hard about the bills if you can avoid it.

By the time I was done I wasn’t interested anymore, and if people were coming by I would struggle to get it to an ‘acceptable’ level of leaves etc in the bottom. 

The second year I spent a bunch of money on a pool robot and variable speed pump. I toss the robot in before bed or on my way to work twice a week or so and the pump runs at a low speed most of the time. 

The difference is night and day, pool cleaning is hardly a thought and the pool chemistry is much more stable.
