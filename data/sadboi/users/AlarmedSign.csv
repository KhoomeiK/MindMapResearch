2) I have read the book you mentioned. It is not helpful. The information in the book is so blatantly obvious, it reads like those ""IT advice threads"". A lot of you Incel Tears members^(im assuming you are a member because your post history consists of you giving vapid advice to incels) just say cookie cutter advice like ""read this book!"" or ""get therapy!"" as if it will suddenly fix all of our problems.

Some of your subreddit even tells us to take a shower, as if we are supposed to say ""OH YEAH I TOTALLY FORGOT TO SHOWER!!!""

3) It's super easy to just say ""go out and talk to people"" but for a lot of the members on this sub (the older ones) there really are not many avenues to talk to people. Stuff like pick up game won't work for us because we are short and ugly. 

4) ""If you've had bad experience you will continue to have bad experiences until you improve, you gotta just power through it."" There are a lot of experiences here where people spent years of their life trying to socialize with others to no avail. I admit I could be trying harder, but I hate being treated as an inferior. I know that I should just get thicker skin, but its sometimes hard to muster up the effort to do something that will just end in me feeling worse.

However I believe that social success and a good social personality comes from having positive social experiences with people. A lot of the people on this sub get treated harshly by women and their male peers. Myself, I was never really bullied, but I was teased a lot. I remember several times during elementary school where people made jokes about my height in front of the whole class, and even the teacher did once. Aside from those remarks, I was largely ignored. If I wanted to talk to someone, usually I had to instigate the conversation (it’s still this way kinda). And I was fine with that, but it’s clearly not the way that a normal/attractive person is treated. There was also a lot of clout given to those who were deemed attractive, and they were treated better. 

My main point is, social skills aren’t really something you can study, like an exam. People form their personality around key events in their life and how others treat them. Hence the term “formative experience”. Me and a lot of the people on this sub missed out on a lot of experiences because of the way we were treated by our peers/women. You can’t just replicate these experiences by going on /r/trp or watching YouTube videos. One example would be a first kiss. Society tells us that a normal person should have their first kiss at 15 (hell I know people who had first kiss before 10 years old).

At the end of the day, the laborer gets paid. The capitalist may not get paid depending on if the house gets sold. If the capitalist doesn’t make profit off of all of this, then why would he even bother with buying the house? 

My family owns a property that they rent out to people, and let me just say that it is a very stressful thing. There are a lot of shitty tenants that just do not pay their rent, and my family still has to pay property tax, so we are losing a good amount of money when tenants decide to be shitbags. The law gives them a month to move out if they fail to pay, so they get two months free and we have to pay the government for this. Some people have destroyed the walls/appliances and I had to fix them.

>Imagine thinking that eating food with estrogen is the same thing as taking birth control pills. Spastic you. Bet you think eating fat converts to actual body fat, right? You're actually fucking retarded.

I already linked the source that says that isoflavones have weak estrogenic effects. Taking a pill and eating these foods are not the exact same thing, but they still have similar results. Results which you stated earlier when you said ""You also need to drink an immense amount of soy milk to develop woman-like features"". This statement proves that you agree that estrogenic foods have estrogenic effects on the body.

Also the rest of your post was a personal attack on me, rather than the argument. You searched all through my post history instead of the words I am speaking to you. Way to be civil, I can just sense how sweaty you are getting while typing this.

Liberal policies do tend to favor larger, more wide-range policies. While conservatives focus on giving more power to their own communities.

First of all, you do realize that the millions of Muslim immigrants you are letting in have the exact opposite opinion? Their religion is strictly anti women, anti gay, anti free speech, and sees any other religion as an enemy?

Idk what to even say to this. Your country never really had to fight because it wasn't important enough to worry about. But now there are many immigrants that see your country as a free meal ticket. You are literally opening the door to invaders with a big smile and you are fucking proud of it."

I believe that people stopped participating in their communities and it has led to nothing but contempt for their hometowns and countries.

Also, there are MANY articles online that advocate for all meat being replaced by this ""impossible meat"". If that were the case, then people WOULD be eating the amount of 4 impossible whoppers a day or more. 

2. Same fucking thing. You are still consuming an unnatural amount of estrogen.

3. Isoflavones have a ""weak estrogenic effect"". In women this results in a decrease in estrogen levels, but in men this results in a significant increase in estrogen levels

I guess that speaks volumes about the necessity of personal social interaction. People who talk less to their community are more likely to hate it, and thus ruin it with progressive ideologies.

Like, ask any liberal what they think about their hometown. Either they grew up in a massive city with no unified culture, OR they hate their small hometown with a passion.
