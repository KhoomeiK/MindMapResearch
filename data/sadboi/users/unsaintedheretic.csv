whatsbotheringyou,foisn2t,t1_foiffjf,1587795706.0,"You definitely should! For the longest time I thought I should just ""suck it up"" because I couldn't possibly be depressed if I wasn't actually down or sad in that sense... And it came back to haunt me because my depression was left untreated for so damn long. 

As for everything else you wrote. I think a lot of it resonates with my younger, depressed, self too. A big part of depression is feeling out of touch with other people because it makes you so apathetic and you feel disconnected on an emotional level. You can't form proper connections anymore because you basically can't feel anything or much at all. Which also causes you to lose a huge part of your empathy. 

I feel as if you have a lot of internal pressure going on. Your home life seems to play a big role and you shouldn't play that down. Your parents might not be abusive in the classical sense but they are definitely contributing to how you're feeling. For instance, you shouldn't see things as black and white as you do. Just because your father doesn't hit you doesn't mean that his behavior doesn't cause you pain. And you generally seem to play down the state you're currently in. 

Which is also pretty typical for people with depression. We love to think that we are the one's who are at fault for how things are going in our life. It's easier to blame yourself than to acknowledge that there are things (sometimes out of your control) that contribute to how you're feeling. Because they are not in your hands and if you blame yourself you get a sense of being able to handle them a bit better.

And while of course it's important to acknowledge our own shortcomings and we definitely shouldn't blame everything on our mental health alone there are things we definitely can at least explain by it."

Oftentimes feeling nothing or apathetic is a sure sign of being clinically depressed.

I used to be extremely depressed when I was younger and for the longest time played it down because I thought I had to be locked up in my room crying 24/7 to be actually depressed when in reality the lack of feeling anything was how my depression showed itself!

In the meantime... Stay strong!"
datingoverthirty,foejbpu,t3_g6yel6,1587705271.0,"Well... Ask yourself as honestly as possible... Do you want to be a ""Hell yes"" or a ""maybe"" for someone?

To be honest I let people be undecided about myself in the past too and nowadays I'm done with this childish BS, because that's what it is. 

If someone really doesn't want to lose you they'll figure their shit out and they'll do so *with you by their side*. Because they'll be too scared to lose you if they do it any other way! 

Anything else is just keeping you around as a ""maybe"" and a second choice and frankly... You should have way more self respect than letting someone treat you like anything else than a first choice and priority.

What it boils down to is this... He's unsure about you, he's making that very very clear and you're sticking around for him to make up his mind and let him keep you around for as long as he wants.
You're basically letting him call the shots and by doing so you give him way too much control over the situation. A relationship shouldn't be one sided. You should get something out of it too.

Are you willing to just sit this out with the prospect of letting other chances slip by because you're waiting on someone who isn't sure about you? 

If I were you I'd cut this off right here and now. If he really doesn't want to lose you it'll be a wake up call and he'll make sure he doesn't. If he let's you go you can be sure that you made the right decision because that's how it would've ended anyway.

That's just my personal opinion though because I've been there and done that and I'd never do it again."
dating,fnuvsz1,t1_fntj0vn,1587272432.0,"I can see why people you're seeing could be confused. I think it depends on how open you communicate when you're seeing someone. 

If you make it crystal clear that you're not planning to commit to someone I don't see anything wrong with doing these things but if you're in any way leaving doubts I think it can come off as being ""hot and cold"" of straight up being interested in getting serious and could be quite unfair to the other person.

If you're communicating openly and they still interpret it as anything else than just nice gestures it's on them, because you've made your intentions clear and anything else is just them *wanting it something that it's not*."
dating,fnuv62w,t1_fnulf1u,1587271934.0,"I think what's important is to find someone where you don't just do all these things for them but get something back too. 

Not necessarily the same amount or the exact same things but a relationship can only work if both people put in the a balanced amount of effort and it's a give and take.

And trust me, just because you didn't get that with your ex doesn't mean you'll never get it. Rather, you should learn from that relationship and aim to establish a healthy balance with your new partner right from the beginning. 
You shouldn't have to be the only one doing all these things. You should get something in return and feel acknowledged and cherished too. 

And you wrote that you didn't understand that he didn't do the same and you don't understand that... I don't know you two or your relationship but what happens a lot of times when someone's the giver (and maybe does too many things for them) and the other the taker is that they start to simply take the other person and what they're doing for them for granted."

I hate how so many people treat this virus as if it just doesn't excist.

datingoverthirty,fmo51sg,t1_fmo1iv1,1586245645.0,"You're welcome and I'm glad I could help! 

I think with dating in general it's always so important to remember that people always have their own reasons for how they handle things but in the end it comes down to this: if they want you in their life *you'll know because they'll show it and they'll be willing to change their ways* (to a certain degree, of course it's not about changing someone's personality or anything like that).

All I can tell you is that if a guy is seriously interested he'll let you know and if you want to be with someone communication is extremely important. Just make sure to let the other person know if their behavior makes you feel unsure about where you stand with them.
Most people will explain themselves, adapt or retreat. Their reaction will let you know whether or not it's worth to pursue them further."
datingoverthirty,fmnwfm3,t1_fmnvb6x,1586237291.0,"Hard to tell kind of, I did notice that it was harder for me to make emotional connections this way in general and if made dating unnecessarily harder sometimes, probably because some of the guys I dated did actually notice that I was hesitant to let myself get invested and lost interest, with others I felt like that they appreciated it though because they weren't ready to get too invested either.

I do think that I did end up sending a signal that I wasn't looking for a serious relationship to some people because of it too. You don't really give a relationship vibe off if you don't look like you actually want to get to know a person haha

It did spare me some heartache I guess because I did manage to stop myself from falling too hard for some guys where things could've never worked out though. (Of course not asking questions is just one part of it) 

But I think it's a balancing act. I've learnt that it's important to neither be too over enthusiastic nor too detached in general. When I realized what I was doing I started to ask questions little by little again and let myself open up more.

Being emotionally distant does have its merits but if you overdo it it can get unhealthy pretty quickly and you end up cutting yourself off from people and push them away.

I guess in the end, if you're dating someone who's not asking questions and it's bothering you (which is totally understandable) you simply have to find out if it's something that will change over time or a character trait/someone not being that interested in the other person (or kind of narcissistic, whatever else there is). 

Either way I'd give it a few weeks or simply talk about it."
datingoverthirty,fmnv8gx,t3_fw6eaw,1586236259.0,"I'm a woman but in the the last year or so I've noticed that I kinda stopped asking too many questions.
I used to try and get as much info on someone as early as possible and at some point I just subconsciously slowed it down.

When I noticed that I sat myself down and thought about why and became aware of the fact that I simply didn't want to invest myself into a potential partner too soon by getting to know every little detail about them in the early dating phase. That way it was easier for me to still be somewhat emotionally detached from them in case things didn't work out. 

It had nothing to do with how much I liked them; quite the contrary actually. The more I liked someone the less I tried to be over enthusiastic and the slower I'd be with asking personal questions.

That doesn't mean that I wasn't asking questions in general but I was just keeping it quite superficial for some time."

Self isolation can be pretty demanding and take a toll on our mental health for various reasons. It's even more challenging for people with ED's (for various reasons) and it can definitely lead to relapses because it's such a stressful time.

What's extremely important, I think, is to have a good support system right now.

Do you have any friends you can face time/talk on the phone with? Do you have the option to go out on walks/ride a bike around town if things get too intense at home? 

How old are you? Would it be an option to go to someone else's place during self isolation? 

This is a tough one and a sensitive matter for some but I did that (I'm in my 30ies though) because I just knew that I wouldn't be able to pull through all of this on my own without getting into a deep depression.

Whenever I get the urge to get back into old habits I read up on corona (especially the situation in Italy) and then I'm back on track.

Personally...
Actually the pandemic is what kicked off my recovery for real this time.

I live close to Italy and seeing how they're doing over there and that food is indeed getting scarce slowly gave me a big reality check... 

I bought canned food, rice, snacks, chocolate, cookies, peanut butter, whatever I could find that's high caloric and stocked up on it so that it will lady me at least a month or two. 
I put it away in my pantry (out of sight out of mind) and started eating semi normally again. (I still count calories but don't binge and purge anymore)

The worst thing that could happen right now is continuing my behavior and having some sort of medical emergency because of it. First off, beinf as underweight as I am is also pretty scary during a pandemic as I'm not sure how my body would handle the virus.

I think during the last few years there’s actually been kind of a shift and for some reason people in europe kind of adapted to a more “american” style of dating. 

Whereas in the past people dated like that nowadays it’s all about labels, having the exclusivity talk and all that jazz. 

It confused the hell out of me when I started dating again after being off the market for some years, because it used to be just like that. 

Basically, when you started going on dates and hanging out with someone, especially once you got intimate, you were more or less considered to be a couple but at least exclusive. People didn’t date around and sleep with others while seeing someone. 

To be honest I wish people would just get back to hanging out, getting to know each other without any pressure and letting these things come naturally. It’s much more carefree imo."
whatsbotheringyou,fj930uw,t1_fj7st2d,1583130238.0,"Well, to be honest, that’s quite hard to answer. 

For me it was finding out what *I, myself* deemed to be attractive and stop trying to please others expectations of being attractive. For instance, at first I tried to buy clothes that I knew men would like... hate to admit that but I didn’t dress for myself but only for others. I’d wear shoes and dresses that were anything else but comfortable but I knew would turn heads.

It took some time but after a while I just felt like that wasn’t me and started to experiment with fashion. Soon Make-up followed and I just did whatever I wanted to and I put on clothes were I knew *I liked them and I could pull them off* even if they weren’t what others would call “attractive” but I felt good in them.

I bought black or blue lipstick if I felt like it, I dyed my hair green, whatever I felt like... all things that most men didn’t even like (it’s astonishing how many men hate green hair lol) but I didn’t care. I just did whatever I felt I wanted to do. 

I just gained so much confidence this way. I just stopped caring what others thought about me or how I looked. I guess that’s what it’s about for me personally. Stopping yourself from trying to please others or trying to impress them with your looks and doing it for yourself only. 

I also just did things that I always wanted to do, I picked up new hobbies, challenged myself to overcome some of my phobias, traveled when I had the money, took myself out on “me dates” where I’d just go to the movies or dinner all by myself... it was small stuff like that that made me get back more in touch with myself again. 

From how you write you really do come off as extremely tough and as if you’re handling what happened quite well! 
I just hope that *if* someday you do feel down about it again you allow yourself some time to wallow and let these emotions in and don’t try to just push them aside. I’ve learnt that confronting negative emotions is really important if someone’s hurt us like that. 

And I really hope you’ll get that residency! I think a fresh start like that will do it’s part in getting you back on track and opening a new chapter in your life that’ll help you refocus and gaining some of that self confidence back on its own!

For instance, saying that they’ll reply in a timely manner doesn’t mean that they’ll do so in a manner suited to someone specific, but rather in a manner that won’t be disrespectful (reading your message and replying a day later without explanation for instance).

I think rather than telling people to just go by why they’re feeling is that people shouldn’t *overthink* and go more by what the other person is showing them and that people who actually treat you with respect and care about you won’t leave you second guessing and overthinking your relationship with them in the first place because their actions will show you where you stand with them anyway, if that makes sense."

Even though you say that you’re over your bf’s infidelity, maybe try and find out if that’s actually true. What he did can run deeper than we think and maybe, just maybe, you’re still hurting from it and that’s partly why you don’t feel better. Try to really heal completely and not just push it away.

I think when someone hurts us in that way a lot of times we just want to get validation from others in order to remind ourselves that we’re *still worth something* because that person made us feel worthless. And I think it’s important for you to determine whether that could be the case. Because if it is you should try and work on that more than anything. It’s natural that your self worth is compromised right now and it’s so so important to try and build it up in a heathy way again. 

Give yourself some attention and don’t rely on getting it from others so much. Although outside validation is nice I think maybe what you need right now is some self love and being content with who you are at your core. 

Try to take everyone else out of the equation, try not to think about what others would feel or think when they look at you. 

Either way... In the end you have to be content with yourself and what others think about you doesn’t really matter. The most attractive thing is good self esteem, anything else can be bought."

datingoverthirty,fiwe38m,t3_fa1dkz,1582782628.0,"I know this already has a lot of responses and this might get buried but whatever...

What... the... hell...

If you hadn’t told us your age I would’ve guessed that these guys were much much younger, honestly. This is just so immature! 

Yes, it might not be the norm to wait a month or longer to get intimate, but no, you’re definitely not a prude!

Sexual compatibility is definitely what makes or breaks a relationship but that doesn’t mean you have to get that out of the way ASAP.

Waiting a month probably means, what, 4 to 5 dates or something? That’s perfectly reasonable and shouldn’t deter anyone from dating you *if they are seriously interested in you*. And to be completely honest I think what you’re doing is just effectively weeding out guys who would’ve ghosted or dropped you after having sex with you anyway.

I think we all underestimate how many men (and probably women too but as I am a straight woman I don’t have any experience dating women) will be willing to tell you that they’ll wait, want something serious and actually wait around a while just to get you comfortable and then still drop you. 

If someone’s actually interested in you they will stick around and respect your boundaries! 

So keep doing what you do, keep your boundaries in place and trust me, the right person won’t try to pressure you into having sex. It might take a while to find that person, sure, but at least you’ll be sure that they’re in it for you."

We are always so quick to resort to blaming ourselves instead of the person who did something wrong because *it’s simply comforting to ask ourselves what we could’ve done differently* because the other person is an outside force that we can’t control or make sense of.

You’re trying to look at it from a perspective where you put yourself in a position that would’ve given you back control over a situation that basically was outside of your control right from the start. 

You can’t look into other people, you can’t read their minds and that fact alone tells you could not have seen it coming. 

There’s nothing you did to make him act this way, he did so because there’s something majorly wrong with him. And in return there’s also nothing you could’ve done to prevent it. 

You tried to put up boundaries again and again and he didn’t listen. That’s all you were able to do really.

I am currently dating someone and (at least I think so) he seems to be equally into it as I am but I am totally aware of the fact that I am not yet ready to show it as much as he does. 

I’ve been badly burnt before and just have a few walls up that I’m just not ready to tear down too soon. I have trust issues that run deep and I’m trying to avoid rushing into something where I put myself at risk to get hurt again.

I really like him, I’m not dating anyone else (and have no desire to do so), I’m thinking about him all the time, I’d text him 24/7 if I could (but don’t)... but I actively try not to dive right into all of this because basically I’m scared to be too vulnerable right now. 

I’ve vocalized that to a certain extent but it can be hard to do so in a manner that will actually get your point across, especially since emotions tend to be irrational sometimes.

How should it be of any use if it doesn’t come as a surprise?

This way all you give the other person is one or two weeks of self doubt, wondering what’s wrong and feeling like shit because they can’t figure out what’s going on because whatever signs you think you’re giving them can’t ever be as clear as you’d think they are. 

You end up feeling like an idiot and even if you would’ve been ok with the breakup (or at least taken it well) there’ll probably be quite a bit of resentment because it’s just so disrespectful to be treated like that.

datingoverthirty,fi9jamr,t1_fi9iutg,1582267994.0,"IMO you can work on these issues without involving or burdening your new partner in/with them, depending on what kind of issues they are. Your new partner should never double as a therapist but yes, to some degree they can also help you to work through them. Sometimes even passively or without knowing it.

As long as you’re over the person you’ve been with - aren’t in love with them anymore - and are emotionally available I don’t see why you can’t do both. 

Of course it depends on what kind of issues they’re dealing with but I think everyone will in some part carry around a bit of baggage from previous relationships once they get to a certain age. It’s inevitable."
datingoverthirty,fi9hk7m,t3_f72zz8,1582266137.0,"If you ask me it’s no excuse *at all*.

I’m honestly pretty tired of people who don’t deal with their issues *before they put themselves out there again* and then use that excuse. 

In my opinion you can get into a new relationship *while still simultaneously working on past issues from a previous relationship*. If you’re honestly invested and interested in the person you’re dating it won’t stop you from pursuing them just because you still have some things to figure out.

So basically, most of the time I think it’s just an excuse to let someone down gently because you just don’t really feel them. And it’s easier to tell them that because it’s the ultimate „It’s me not you“ (or even it’s neither me nor you, it’s my circumstances).

Also, yes, it can happen that sometimes people are really not in any place to date and are triggered by a chance meeting and dating again too soon but if we’re honest most people actively start dating (especially since it’s become so much easier and more available through OLD) way too soon *in order to deal with their issues* because they think that another person will fix their issues instead of fixing it themselves.

But in my experience they will just date around, hold on to people they are not that invested in... and then give them exactly that excuse. Because whomever they’re dating is just part of their healing process. 

And that’s just a toxic way of thinking really. Because if I’ve learnt one thing it’s that this is just true: 

If you don’t heal what cut you, you’ll bleed all over people who didn’t cut you.

And these people should just stop dating, take some time for themselves, figure their issues out and deal with whatever they have to deal with. 
Because it’s not fair to put others in that position."

dating,fi00qgg,t3_f5kxbr,1582020954.0,"I had the exact opposite experience. Whenever I played it cool only people got more interested in me where it didn’t work out in the long run. I basically got them hooked but only for a short while/until the honeymoon phase was over.

The people I was just myself with and showed a normal amount of interest in/didn’t act a certain way stuck around because they also didn’t play games and were genuine. 

I don’t think that playing games ever leads to something substantial. It may work at first but whenever you have to act differently (no matter in which area) you’ll sell them a version of yourself that isn’t true to who you are and at some point you’ll make a switch to your true self, whether you want to or not, and that’s where things usually end. Because even if you played it cool in the beginning and they liked that you won’t keep that up forever and go back to your normal level of interest at some point and then it’ll get too much for them and they’ll drop you.

People you really click and vibe with are the one’s who get you and aren’t put off with your level of interest in them from the get go imo."

dating,fhdlhe4,t1_fhd8opf,1581490444.0,"I can totally understand your thought process and I think it’s completely natural that you’d look at it this way, I think it’s just almost comforting to go and think that this is something you brought upon yourself because you went and tried out online dating and that this wouldn’t have happened had you dated “the traditional way”.

It’s the basic concept of: if I wouldn’t have done that, worn this, hadn’t been at this bus stop at that time... then this and that wouldn’t have happened... it shifts the blame from the predator to yourself and makes you feel a little bit more in control of the situation because you feel as if you had any say in what could’ve or should’ve happened when in reality you didn’t because what transpired *was the decision of the predator*.

This is classic victim blaming that society ingrained in our brains because it’s always easier to shift the focus and blame to the victim so others can say: oh that wouldn’t happen to *me*, because *I wouldn’t have done this and that* and wouldn’t have put myself in that situation.

*He chose to do what he did and he’s responsible for his actions.* 

And let me tell you one thing: **You did nothing wrong and there was and is nothing wrong with you, in no way did you bring this upon yourself or do you have anything on you that attracted him in particular! You are not to blame for what happened, for staying with him and if it wasn’t you he would’ve simply found someone else to make his victim!**

I know how hard it is to not blame yourself if something as bad as this happens to you but you have to accept that **this could’ve happened to anyone**.

Unfortunately too many victims fall back on blaming themselves for a myriad of reasons, one of them being that it actually gives them comfort. Because as a victim one of the worst things is losing control and that gives you back a bit of that loss.
I feel as if sometimes it’s also just easier to be confronted with yourself and push the abuser into the background so you don’t really have to deal with him anymore. 

And that’s also exactly why I put this in my original comment: *Everyone can fall for them, all these people saying “that wouldn’t happen to me” just don’t know themselves well enough.*

Because that’s the truth. All these people that are so tough and tell a woman who’s stuck in an abusive relationship “Why don’t you just get up and leave? I would never let that happen to me” or wonder why a person who’s getting abducted and has multiple chances to escape but doesn’t take them... have zero empathy, simply don’t understand basic psychology and are basically just full of themselves. 

You can’t ever know how you’d react to a situation if you’ve never lived it before.

Sorry that this got so long and I hope I made sense. I’ve dealt with victim blaming myself before (although my situation was not nearly as bad as yours) and it just breaks my heart every time a person blames themselves for the actions of someone who broke them like this. 

I really hope you’ll be able to recover from this. The fact that you’re able to share this with all of us and are still standing should show you how strong you are. The fact that you’re still alive and fighting should show you that you are stronger than this POS who tried to break you and didn’t succeed. *He is the weak one here!

Nowadays you can sit on the loo while you swipe away and just fill open slots in your calendar with dates if you’re bored otherwise.

My advice is to simply take a break, especially from OLD, because in my experience most people on there are the kind of people who are in some way damaged and are looking to fill a void without putting in any effort - that’s why so many people meet those who fall into the “I’m not ready to date” or “I’m not over my ex” category type of people there."
relationship_advice,fh7ciii,t3_f1j8n6,1581324701.0,"Honestly I feel as if you’re a really mature and calm person and I applaud you for that.

I think that yes, if you can’t find common ground on core issues and boundaries like these it’s probably best to go separate ways and it’s healthy for you to choose to break up if she can’t seem to accept your boundaries. 

For her to remain in contact with him like this is basically just disrespectful. It’s one thing to have loose contact (like, I’ll eventually run into my ex when we meet in a bigger group of shared friends (it was a long relationship) but I won’t go out of my way to meet with him one on one) but another to keep someone that close when you agreed to stay away from exes and you know that your behavior will hurt your partner.

Also, once trust is broken it’s extremely hard to rebuild it. Adding to her contact with her ex is also her cocaine use and drinking and I think for her to be able to rebuild that trust she’d probably have to change her whole lifestyle and it’s questionable if she’d be even willing to or able to do that.

I think the best thing now is to stay seperated and if she’s really invested she’ll make all these changes on her own. Once she’s done that you guys could possibly be able to rekindle your relationship. If not I do agree that you two probably just aren’t a good fit because you just don’t share the same lifestyle and core values that are needed for a functioning relationship."

bartenders,fh3tf7w,t3_f1b53s,1581272111.0,"Depends on the bartender but personally I feel that it’s highly unprofessional to give someone more than they expect and I wouldn’t go back there to be honest. 

Some bartenders think they give someone a “treat” by handing out more and do it because someone’s just a nice person, flirting, a regular, whatever... but let me tell you one thing, giving someone more alcohol than they’d expect, especially in a drink where you might not even notice it, without telling them so can be *damn dangerous*.

I was once at a bar with friends of mine and at one point just got way too drunk without expecting it. We had cocktails and after the third I was almost shitfaced. I have a high tolerance, I was a regular at that bar and just couldn’t understand what had happened. 

I went back there a week later and turns out that the barkeeper thought he’d give me almost *double* the alcohol per serving because “I’m a regular and a pleasant guest”. That’s just really uncool and unprofessional. I didn’t want double of what I ordered and it’s not nice to suddenly be twice as drunk as you planned on being.

Whenever I gI’ve out more to regulars I’ll give them a heads up or just take something off their tab that they’d already consumed. Other guests I’d just hand out a free shot (if they wanted) as a treat. But you don’t basically force people to drink more than they anticipate."

Please don’t give up and seek help! Things might look really dark and as if there’s no way to improve them right now but that’s just not true. Things are really always darkest before dawn and *it can and will get better!*"
bartenders,fh3m4nd,t3_f17nb0,1581270271.0,"I love it when the trash takes itself out.

Nice how you handled that one! I don’t think I would’ve been able to keep a straight face!

I just don’t understand how people like that even find acquaintances who are willing to hang out with them."
dating,fh2gak7,t3_f17ndn,1581251436.0,"Take a break from Dating. Honestly, it’s the same as when you get a burnout from working too much - just take a break and stop putting yourself in situations that aren’t good for you.

I’m in the same situation right now. I simply don’t enjoy dating at the moment and realized a while ago that I also had the wrong motive (I wasn’t emotionally available and was simply looking to fill the void my ex left me with) and I’ve become so much more content and happy with myself since I stopped dating altogether.

Trust me, there’ll come a time where you’ll be feeling better about it again. I think I’m slowly getting there but there was a time where I honestly started to grow extremely bitter and almost started to despise men in general because of all the bad situations I ended up in. 

Try to be comfortable being single for awhile. Take some time for yourself. Take yourself on dates. Practice self care. Just take your time to get back in touch with yourself."
toastme,fh27rab,t3_f14s2b,1581239247.0,"You honestly don’t need any kind of filter or editing! You look fabulous! 

And as for the cheating, I really hope you realize now that how others treat you says so much more about who they are (a really shitty person in that case) than it says about how much you are worth or who you are! 

You deserve better and I am so so glad that you are still with us! I read your comment about overcoming self harm and I am so happy about that too! You seem like a really strong person, keep that up!!"
dating,fh26ti8,t3_f14pd4,1581237931.0,"A lot of people expect first dates to tell them whether or not the other person is a good fit. They expect there to be a spark and to basically hit it off with someone. A lot of times though you need at least two or three dates to really determine whether or not you have chemistry. 

Basically, just ask her out again and see where it takes you. A first date is kind of like a job interview and the dates that follow are like having your first few days actually working at a new company. 

And especially when it comes to banter, teasing each other etc., people can be nervous and maybe they just need to warm up. It’s just too soon to tell. You want to make a good impression on a first date and usually don’t really show who you *really* are unfiltered.

Just don’t overthink it. Maybe you’ll click, maybe you won’t. A first date is too early to tell, if you ask me."
dating,fh26d97,t1_fh21hcm,1581237311.0,"Then why are you posting this in the dating sub? 

Anyway, if someone doesn’t want to talk to you respect their decision and move on."
