BorderlinePDisorder,fr37e6l,t3_gmelb5,1589851444.0,I am drunk now every night for weeks and that's only cos I'm home with the parents. Im worse at university. I'm new here so I can't deal with it yet and I especially can't deal with the lack of understanding or lack of knowledge on what to do. Its to hard and alcohol makes me happy
Psychosis,fr36smd,t3_glxrp2,1589851096.0,Almost was but luckily it was a caution and nothing more. I was lucky I didn't go further at that time. That was nearly a year ago and I still fall into a bad mindset if ever I think about her or hear her name. Unfortunately she has a very common name and am scared while I'm sane i will go further should I bump into her. Corona is good for something after all.
depression,fqrxe8t,t3_gkm6fu,1589593934.0,I feel your pain it's hard
depression,fqrxc8c,t3_gkm7jq,1589593900.0,"Depression is a bitch and so was Ur ex (I guess) it seems like.

BorderlinePDisorder,fpxp3p3,t3_gg1vwc,1588986755.0,I feel u I've read the 9 symptoms list and feel association to all 9 of them haven't had a psychiatrist or episode since turning 18 so have gone though finding a diagnosis but I wish u the bet if you'll do the same for me
Psychosis,fpx9dlb,t1_fpx99r3,1588978201.0,Very true
Psychosis,fpx99r3,t3_gg278k,1588978140.0,We should make a group for people like myself with pyschotic depression. Everyone I've told us 2 people have run a mile from me since. I don't want to be alone anymore
depression,fpeu8h6,t1_fpetnyr,1588555047.0,Also true but hey what can you do. I'm an alright guy but even I take what I can get. Meds helped but hey I'm suicidal all on my own. Smiley
depression,fpeth3v,t1_fpetabv,1588554579.0,Well I mean my voices were good company for a while so define good.
depression,fpetdo3,t1_fpc0zfn,1588554521.0,Seriously. People understand regular depression accept it and try to help but when I open up about my real problems people run a mile. All my friends feel fake like that. Meds help but I hate em ever ever since u tried to use them to take my life. Thanks mate
depression,fpet58b,t1_fpet3fg,1588554380.0,I haven't because I'm a good child but yea I feel like that ain't good
depression,fpet3fg,t1_fpcaryt,1588554348.0,Hey mate u ever considered murder
Psychosis,fpet0na,t1_fpbouep,1588554302.0,Meds have eased the delusion and hallucinations up a little but still always terrified fun fun
Psychosis,fpesvqx,t1_fpbn9lb,1588554221.0,Yep
Psychosis,fpesv4o,t1_fpd17l5,1588554210.0,I'd love too what u all talking bout
Psychosis,fpesryh,t1_fpc5jo0,1588554158.0,"For me it was never visual hallucinations tho when I was really down I had auditory hallucinations I spoke to and kept me company mostly about ""eliminating the bad in my life"" yea by which it's alot of murder fantasy I don't know the right subbreddit to talk about I had some bad people in my life. Delusion is a hard one to self assess but based on reaction from my therapists I guess so. Thus was really my experience but it's different for different people. I definitely think hallucinations are possible. I always saw it as pyschosis induced by severe depression and just the body flipping a switch"
depression,fpbqk8w,t1_fpbqeec,1588476241.0,Haha admittedly accidentally but I'm not changing it because yea your right. It's pretty accurate
BPD,fp3aq4e,t1_fp3anat,1588276040.0,I think my people were just under 2 months tho
BPD,fp3anat,t3_gazy08,1588276001.0,"I feel this, I had it recently met new people at university. I was too ""interesting"" one of them put it. I'd I scared them aware with my illness. I barely left my room sober from that point on for the PTSD like symptoms."
depression,fp100xu,t1_fp0zt92,1588220885.0,Thank you I do appreciate it. Life isn't fun without some craziness. Well it ain't fun anyways but especially without craziness
depression,fp0z73a,t1_fp0yk41,1588220312.0,Well let's see 3 years is a long time hence why my therapist is happy with this keeps me out of crisis treatment and involatary inpatient wards. I'm just trying my best but imma just hold on for now life has been wild the past few years let's see
depression,fp0xuyk,t3_gao2co,1588219397.0,Course we do. Parents often don have a clue as much as your meant to love th u can feel real affection from strangers more. I don't know why but it feels me with more warmth then I ever feel receiving messages it why I post as much as I do despite crippling anxiety. . In fact it the only reason I and many post it's just nice. Idk I ramble alot online too just because I know someone what's too listen. It rarely males sense ðŸ˜‚
depression,fp0wvoa,t1_fp0wmam,1588218748.0,Tru I think this is account 4 rn thought id make one because I kept deleting things too fucked for my main account. There's so much wrong with me it's unbelievable. What's great about Reddit is there's a sub for all of it. So I can just keep posting my head
depression,fp0wkrj,t3_gal4l7,1588218550.0,Bad advice but I just get fucked up if I'm in a particularly bad rut.  Besides that yea good music is really it unfortunately
depression,fp0weks,t3_galru0,1588218441.0,Relatable. Hdbehsnwmkwwnkwk nejdbrhbfjejsjebejsjhebdbeje
depression,fp0vybt,t3_gak5mq,1588218151.0,You don't know why she did what she did. It was a time after you the fact she asked u for hell is enough to solidify that your a good person. Obviously we don't know what went on between you two but it was obviously intense your a good person and the fact you allowed yourself to say no means you have a bright future if you can make it through this. I wish u the best my friend
depression,fp0vhvk,t1_fp0v34t,1588217852.0,I get you. If I ever rewrite my suicide note imma post it here and I'm not expecting much to come from it. At the end of the day this is a site people want to move away from there internal problems on so karma here is hard to come by. I've got alot to say on this account but I'm doubtful I'll get a I've 100 karma for the fact im dedicating this account to these kinds posts
depression,fp0utu2,t3_gajz2y,1588217421.0,We've all been there. Soon it'll be your turn. What makes you want to die?
depression,fp0uofh,t3_gajysh,1588217325.0,"With a vodka in hand, it must be nice. I'm the one messaging often and for alot I'm still waiting"
BPD,fozqnxp,t3_ga8wg7,1588195180.0,I didn't know there's a name for it. I can't even get through tiger king and it's really good! It's been a long time since I found something I really enjoyed ive just been blaming depression.
