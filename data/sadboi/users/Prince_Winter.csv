The game isn't balanced around endurance, but those players find a way to work around the system. The game isn't balanced around railjack either sadly,its balanced around sorties. The lvl3ks where meant to be an example of how its possible to work around the innate problems of the game, that being armour and damage scaling. 

I Haven't had a problem with my own damage in railjack, excluding the railjack's 'guns' themselves. Same with cc. Don't understand what issues you're having. Long cast times are a problem on vauban i agree with that, but the strength of the cc makes up for it."
Warframe,fdnegnh,t1_fdncb6b,1578584068.0,"If it takes five minutes to kill one dude, you've got mod setup issues. There's plenty of things That kill in extremely high levels, you say these issues don't nt exist outside of railjack. But endurance runners disagree with that. Lvl 3000 are plenty tankier and more damaging than the stuff in railjack. Having armour issues? Bring a frame with an armour strip either built in or with an augment. Ash(1st skill, augment) or grendel(1st skill, un augmented), would be good since they can survive using their invis/chonk respectivley. Hell even some weapons excel at armour strip like  pox built corrosive blast. 

If you refuse to use different frames for different mission types, thats just being inflexible. There are frames that have answers to everything. You nitpick crowd control mostly not having los, but there's just as many abilities that don't need los to freeze/slow/etc look at frost, vauban, limbo, wisp's shock mote. Equinox even has decent cc with her maim has a small stagger on it once enemies enter its range, that will let you switch to day and sleep enemies while they cant react. Complain about high damage numbers, let me introduce you to the church of saryn ember mesa octavia and harrow. You have options that you refuse to use. 

If you think you HAVE to farm for railjack gear you don't . You don't have to be the host of the mission. Find someone who has a good railjack. Find someone in your clan you can do railjack with or just look in recruiting for people hosting it. 

There are ways to solve your issues, you just need to use them."
