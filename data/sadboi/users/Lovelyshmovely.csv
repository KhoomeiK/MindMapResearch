OrganizationPorn,fpnvc8e,t1_fpnjn0f,1588773339.0,"I got them from the Container Store! They are the iDesign Linus Shallow organizers. I just picked some out they have all kinds of sizes. 

I did not use museum gel. The liner is also from the container store and the organizers have little rigid bumps on the bottom on the corners that digs into the liner a little so they don‚Äôt budge. Also packed the drawer full of the organizers so there‚Äôs no room for sliding around or anything even if I didn‚Äôt have the liner."

selfimprovement,fpit1wa,t3_gdbk83,1588648067.0,"100 percent same boat. For the first time in my life (27) I truly don‚Äôt feel lonely being alone, and I‚Äôm not yearning for someone to be in a relationship with. It will be nice when it happens I‚Äôm sure, but it‚Äôs not a priority at all. 

I‚Äôm focusing on my career, fitness and health, learning about personal finance and investing, skincare, cultivating spaces that make me feel good (interior design, organization, finding the right place to live on my own without roommates for the first time). Feeling really optimistic for the future and I know I‚Äôll be where I want to be when I close out my 20s in a little over 2 years time. 

Best of luck to you!"

I almost endeavored to make my own mirror but I didn‚Äôt trust myself to not mess up. The mirror has electric all through it and outlets on the sides for hair tools. I love it. 

The drawer in the table is actually quite big, so that where I have all my makeup and skincare products. Ones that are larger or don‚Äôt fit go in the second drawer in the little white unit to the right of the setup. At my old place, my skincare and makeup stuff was also littered everywhere, so when I moved here last year my goal was to fix that issue lol."

If you are in one of the the outer boroughs, don‚Äôt say you‚Äôre going into NYC, just say ‚Äúthe city.‚Äù

Don‚Äôt ask people where a restroom is. You‚Äôre on your own to find one and you probably need to go to a restaurant or bar because stores generally don‚Äôt let you use the bathroom. 

Instead of saying pizza, you can say fun things like slice and pie. 

Don‚Äôt walk slow. Ever."
