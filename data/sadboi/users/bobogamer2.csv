Almost nothing can offend me, because i did grow strong by spirit while i was in elementary school, being the strange kid and literally every day being bullied. I’ve had and still have a lots of family problems. Also with my frustration as a teenager, i am growing as a problem too. That’s why the only two things that can offend me are if someone tells me that im weak, or if someone tells me i have no life. You probably understand why already 😉 Next time look after what jokes you are using. They are not always powerless."
