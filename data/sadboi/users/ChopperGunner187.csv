Speaking from the experience of dating a narc (and growing up with one as a parent), they can be 100% aware of what they're doing, and aware that it's hurting you, yet still continue persistently. They genuinely won't care that it's hurting you, as long as they get whatever they need out of it. This is due to having zero empathy. 

I do feel like even narcs can become better people, but no outside influence can trigger that, it has to come from within. Narcs are masters of avoiding cognitive dissonance (borderlines too, I know) and will do any mental gymnastics to convince themselves that the hurtful things they do are justified. For this reason, i feel like narcs somewhat deserve the stigma. But i am also aware that I'm probably just jaded from my prior relationship.

> Willing to manipulate or cheat on someone isn't exactly empathetic

As a borderline myself, I do have urges to cheat and occasionally manipulate, but my empathy is what 'talks' me out of actually committing to doing it. I actually feel bad when i hurt others so I tend to try to avoid doing that. People with 'unchecked' BPD (who are either unaware of their condition, or simply don't care) **are** dangerous. Borderlines can have, what I personally call, 'selective empathy'. Basically where you can turn your empathy on and off, at will (or simply do mental gymnastics to override it). This ability can also be used to manipulate (a person with ill intent can appear loving and genuinely empathetic in short bursts)

When my empathy is turned off, I'm no different from a narc. Fortunately through a lot of experience, self-reflection and meditation, I've 'checked' myself quite a bit. So it's pretty rare for me to 'turn off' my empathy. Example: Most of the time I try to be a kind, loving person. I try to always help people, I'll give a person my last dollar etc. But I still have impulse issues where I'll get behind the wheel of my car and turn my empathy completely off. Everyone around me are just pawns and obstacles for me to swerve around to get to my destination. Complete narcissist mode. 


> people with BPD just helpless creatures effected by circumstance

I hate that play-victim crap, as well. At the same time though, I feel like both narcs and borderlines *are* effected by circumstance (by having to grow up around toxic guardians that most likely projected their own self-hate into them). The two personality variants are just two different ways for that individual to cope with that trauma (I'm not forgetting the other cluster B disorders, I just don't know enough to speak on them more in depth). At a certain point in life though, it is up to that individual to properly deal with those issues and try to heal, rather than to keep the cycle going and continue to project their hate and insecurities onto the people around them. 

> So which group really deals with stigma?

Honestly, both. But for slightly different reasons. I feel like borderlines have the ability to heal more easily, or to at least get to a point where their emotions and impulses can be managed. Narcs aren't going to give up their ideology without a fight, and they're going down swinging. I also feel like, in this fucked up world, having *some* empathy is better than having none at all."

> and GTA 4 online was pretty bare-bones from what I remember

I know, and call me weird, but I loved that. There was no direction in GTA IV MP. It was all up to the player's imagination. In V online, [it was originally planned](https://www.reddit.com/r/gtaonline/comments/cyt5bx/one_day_maybe/eyua1c6/) to allow players to identify as either a cop or gang member. You'd keep your territory safe (or play as a cop to keep the lobby 'safe'). 

Bare bones as fuck, I know. But with mechanics like that, you know it would have led to chaos. They still could have added properties and cars (and still sold shark cards). Added more contact missions, ""Jobs"", activities (restaurant, globally shared clubs/casino, restaurants, gyms etc. It would have mixed roleplay, PvP, and possibly PvE all into one. And would have felt a little more wholesome and less driven by toxicity, like it is now. But nope, cause money. 

> have you played RDR2?

I have not, unfortunately. I will eventually though. It looks amazing and I'm loving the fact that they're putting more effort into the small nuances/details. It still makes me sad that they're dogging the online player base. [Snubbing RD2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNMxsxEYpaM) for more cash-grabbing on GTAO. 

While it looks great, at first glance , based on what I'm hearing, it seems like it still suffers from lacking any actual depth beyond the surface, like in GTA V. Rockstar seems very adamant about [being control freaks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvJPKOLDSos&feature=youtu.be&t=22m39s) and not offering the player tools/opportunity to complete missions in their own custom way, which would allow for a more unique and personalized game-play experience.

I feel you. But that's a sign that we should have moved on to the next GTA installment by now. The reason the timing feels off for everyone is because Rockstar decided to double-dip using content from canceled story-mode DLC. Awarding toxic players with griefer tools in order to keep people coming back is not the way to go. 

> If you have a money printer you don't pull the plug

I'm not asking them pull the plug. Not everything has to be black or white. I just want them to remember where they came from and to value their players a bit higher. They could have still made 1 billion the first 3 days, later sold story DLC content and made a shit-ton of extra cash while retaining a good reputation among most fans. 

Random hot take: I personally don't feel like Online mode needed a ""story"" line. Game content will inevitably become stale over time, but if you give a game solid mechanics to play with from the get-go, it will keep the game fresh for a long time. It's the reason why so many people have fond memories of dicking around offline in GTA SA. Solid game mechanics + a huge map. 

A lot of people don't know this, but Online was originally going to be an evolved version of IV multiplayer, where Rockstar was planning on adding awesome unique game mechanics to allow players to ""create"" their own stories and experiences as they went along. Instead of players being forced to do the same scripted missions, or owning the same exact physical businesses etc. No story + dedicated fun online modes + solid game mechanics are what made GTA IV multiplayer so great. Yeah it eventually got stale, but if Rockstar sticks to their usual schedule (that has been set in place for over a decade now) instead of trying to milk one specific game, we'll have the next GTA out by the time that happens. 

When you play online in its current state, it's obvious the story elements (casino, clubs, arcades, government contract work bs) were shoehorned in from story mode. When I see them doing that, it feels like a watching a greedy drug-dealer trying to stretch their product out by cutting it with other bs. Make it last/sell as long as they can.

I'm speaking strictly about the GTA franchise, RDR2 looks fan-fucking-tastic, but the cowboy niche was never really my thing, so i can't properly speak on it. But I do know Rockstar went from using RenderWare in 2004 GTA SA, to R.A.G.E. in GTA IV, arguably their most ""in-depth"" game to date, in four years.

Geez, idk. One would hope that the company they've supported for years could, for once, value their fans above dollar signs. Personally I don't want them to stop completely, but to at least cut us some slack and lower prices, raise mission pay outs etc. 

GTA V, by itself, made 1 billion the first 3 days, while beating 7 world records. Now you're bragging to me, on Rockstar's behalf, about how they beat that insane number last christmas via their Online service. How much is enough for them? When will we ever go back to a GTA that has sensible pricing? A GTA that doesn't employ malicious dark-patterns via in-game mechanics to annoy/frustrate their players into turning towards microtransactions? 

When will we ever go back to a GTA environment that's actually fun to just dick around? A game that once had it's own identity and didn't copy silly kid-like mechanics from its prior competition? When did it become normal to build your game from the ground up with intentionally tedious, boring, often nerfed-since-launch missions that hardly anyone actually wants to play? Most people that I've played with have no idea what the actual fucking plot of Online is even about, or what it's leading up to, they just play for the cash. Everywhere you look people are desperately looking for glitches or a hand out, just to skip the tedious grind. That's not normal. As a player, I should feel motivated to *want* to complete the story, not feel like I *have* to in order to get any enjoyment at all.

One would go into standby, never to wake again until a forced restart. I hated that one. Always did that when I needed to make a time sensitive call. Another one stopped reading SIM cards, another refused to sync with any computer.

My final one was a soldier, though. Lasted about 3 and a half years. Completely scuffed to hell. Cracked screen. AUX cable broke off halfway in the headphone jack. Then I stupidly tried texting on it in the pouring rain and that ruined the speaker that you use for calls (when putting it up to your ear). That + the headphone jack issue meant that all calls had to be placed on speaker or bluetooth. Still, the OS ran perfectly and was still my daily device in 2017. Kinda wanted to see how much abuse it could take, at this point.

While I have very little doubt in Houser's writing skills, I still wouldn't want either Houser brother anywhere near this project. Have you [read the emails](https://www.scribd.com/doc/308200451/Benzies-v-Rockstar) back and forth between Leslie and Sam? Sam comes off as very manipulative and narcissistic. Idk what their upbringing was like, but I can only assume that Dan doesn't fall far from this tree of toxicity. 

After the whole royalties debacle, I can't see Leslie ever wanting to work with either of them, again. Besides, we need some genuine pressure on Rockstar/GTA. And to do that we need a fresh and unique open-world concept. I feel like, with enough resources, Leslie can achieve that. I've heard that he has a few ex-Rockstar devs on his team, as well as his son, who was also fired from Rockstar, out of pettiness. 

I also feel like Rockstar/the Housers are the ones that decided to turn Leslie's [original concept of Online into the toxic grindfest](https://www.reddit.com/r/gtaonline/comments/cyt5bx/one_day_maybe/eyuwj7k/?context=3) that we have today (again, out of pettiness, to smite Benzies one last time). Online is an overall toxic game, that was designed (reworked) by toxic people, aimed to reward toxic players/behavior. At the same time, they also fucked their fanbase over (and lied on their promises) by using canceled story-mode DLC as a means to stretch content out over the last 5+ years, in order to make even more cash. While the Houser's build overall fantastic fucking games (from a technical/visual standpoint), these days, they often let their greed get the best of them. I wouldn't want either of them anywhere near 'Everywhere'.

Then 7 finally became the mature ""Vista"" Microsoft wanted from the get-go and moved on the POSReady 7.

CrownVictoria,fmcza8g,t1_fmctsvl,1585955909.0,"Honestly, if it's truly want you want, you should just get a former fleet LTC for dirt cheap. Don't be afraid of the ones with stupid high miles either, I used to be afraid of buying them until I got my hands on my current 400k mile LTC that I use as my daily. Paid $1300 cash for it.

Zero engine/drivetrain issues, no check engine lights, passes SMOG, air-ride functions perfect, 95% of the interior is in immaculate condition, save for the minor rip of the leather in the seat of the driver's seat and the door handle ""fake chrome"" trim on the passenger door handles has a bit of wrinkles from being opened so many times. OEM radio likes to eat my CDs and keep them for itself. Also the A/C has a leak (heat + dual zone blend door crap works...for now). 

But god damn it, it runs and shifts like a champ. And it rides *amazing*. Legit feels like it could have just driven off of the dealership floor. Better (but not faster) than any MGM or P71 I've owned. So freaking quiet. I'm almost certain everything on this car, save for the motor, probably has been replaced at some point by the fleet company. 

I actually feel bad when I romp on it sometimes, Town Cars don't exactly ""beg"" to get beat on the way P71s do. This car has actually turned my driving habits into that of an old man (I'm 25). I've caught myself doing 10 under the limit a lot of times lately. Now I can empathize with the old people who drive these so damn slowly. I never used to give a fuck about my P71s, lmao.

Lol yes, i feel you on that. That's just my bias speaking, I'd change a few things as well. But it would all be mostly mechanical/minor cosmetics. I know people love power, but I honestly love the 4.6 and wouldn't want any other engine, but I do wish Ford would have gave the Panthers the same engine calibration/tune that the 2v Mustangs had (260hp, 302lb ft of torque). These cars need all the power they can get. 

Also the Town Car should have gotten the 4v Lincoln Intech V8/Mach 1 motor like damn-near every other older Lincoln had (it's even more fucked up because there's documentation out there to prove that Ford legitimately considered doing this at one point while designing the Marauder, the LTC almost got a 4v during this process, but was considered 'too expensive' and not enough demand to be worth it.).

And at minimum, at least a 5 speed trans with a very short and aggressive 1st gear to get these boats moving better from a dead-stop. Physical body design tho? Still wouldn't touch it."
CrownVictoria,fmc76d9,t1_fmbt7av,1585940173.0,"Honestly if you have a heavy foot or tend to thrash on your cars a lot (I definitely do) then I think the P71 is a better choice. I've owned everything except for the Marauder (hopefully soon!) and I feel like the civilian panthers feel a bit more restricted in their performance. 

I hate how my Town Car short shifts at 5000rpm, but I know it's to protect the larger-but-weaker civilian torque converter. But then it also locks out the ability to downshift back to first gear if you're already above 30mph at half throttle and upshift early, but want to go back into 1st (not the case with P71s, 1st is available to downshift into, up to 40mph). I know why Ford designed it that way, much smoother more linear acceleration/shifting with low/quiet RPMs, and you don't get the jarring aggressive 'jolt' from the RPMs shooting back up near the redline. But it's still annoying when I'm try to pass someone only to have to lug in 2nd gear, when I know for a fact that 1st should still be available.

If I had the spare cash I'd love to take a P70 extended wheel-base Vic and add every heavy duty/luxury/performance feature from the P71, MGM, Town Car, and Marauder all into one 'Ultimate' Panther. I'd try to bring back literally every feature Ford ever removed/decontened from the platform. 

I don't feel like you made a mistake, man. You can go to a junkyard for parts and add the fake wood grain from the CVLX to your dash, leather LTC seats/middle console etc. if you really want that feel. I've done that to previous P71s. You can also add aftermarket sound insulation for the road noise, as well."
CrownVictoria,fmc61xg,t1_fmbqb5l,1585939576.0,"> It's such a ""Do your job"" interface.

Honestly this is what I always loved about all of my P71s. Especially the older (pre 2003) ones. It was such a mish-mash of different eras/mindsets with a few subtle hints from its original luxury-car roots (the slow-dim theater lighting when you close your door, or the fancy wiper park effects that the older P71s and other Panthers had whenever you would set the wipers to 'delay' - when they would set about an inch above the normal park position and slowly fade down). 

At the end of the day, I always loved the ""serious"" tone it always conveyed. Even down to the front facsia/bumper design. I feel like every car design has that human face/emotion on the front of them. I've always chalked it up to the designers projecting their own mindset/vibe into the design of the vehicle (and whatever demographics it's supposed to be marketed to). For example, when you look at the front of BMWs and newer Chargers you sorta get that angry/aggressive narcissistic ""I'm better than you"" feel from looking at the front of it. 

But with the Town Car/MGM always felt more humble/confident/'sure of itself' and the design never really ""tries too hard"" to impress you. While the P71s had a more neutral ""I've already seen it all, I may be old-school but don't piss me off and make me come back out of retirement to fuck you up"" vibe to it. Same goes for the Marauder. I love it. I wouldn't change a thing about them."
