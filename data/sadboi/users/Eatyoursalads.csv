curlyhair,fr3oj8k,t3_gmgq6m,1589862126.0,"First, you're an awesome parent for taking the time to do this for your daughter. She will appreciate it hugely someday :)

Theres a great beginner's guide in the sidebar of this sub. But just some general tips, try to comb hair rather than brush it. Comb it only when it's wet and filled with conditioner. You mentioned a 2in1 wash, this is fine for a shampoo but she needs a seperate conditioner as well. Try to wash her hair like, twice a week if you can, and rinse it with just conditioner on the other days. If you need to comb it on the days you don't wash it, spray it down with conditioner and water in a bottle. Master the art of doing pigtail braids on her hair, very gently. It will keep her hair clean and out of her face while she plays, and make life just bit easier on both of you.

Not everything will work for everyone's hair, naturally there will be some trial and error with all this. Good luck, your daughter has very beautiful hair <3"

She said something along the lines of ""just because our friendship doesn't look the same doesn't mean I don't value it or love you just as much."" 

I think it's common among people with depression to isolate more. It can be harder for us to go out and live life with the people we love.

I've never been to therapy camp or a retreat, unless you count inpatient haha. Have you considered an outpatient program?

My SH scars were immensely helped by bio-oil and saran wrapping my leg overnight to flatten them, however Im not sure that will be possible on your surgery scar. For something of that grade, the best you can do is keep it clean and keep it moisturized. Maybe start off cleaning it with hibaclense and moisturizing with aquaphor.

This agreement I worked out with someone close to me was super duper effective. It held me accountable to myself and to someone I loved, and involving him in the experience a little made me realize how much hurting myself hurt him, so that motivated me to quit as well.

Different things work for different people, but if you truly can't get help, you HAVE to reach out to the people you love. You are so strong, and I believe in you, but this is a battle so hard to fight alone. I needed help to win it, and that's okay if you do too.

Wishing you peace ❤"

You've quit it once, you can do it again. You've relapsed and that's okay, it doesn't mean you're starting over in you're recovery. A little more behind, but still so far along. You're doing great! We're all rooting for you!"

depression,fl1ptvs,t3_flx2ui,1584733823.0,"We have such a negative connotation around ""attention-seeking"" in western society. I don't particularly understand it. Like, if you break your leg, you don't hide it away or play it off like it's not so bad. You ask somebody to take you to the hospital, and get attention from a doctor to heal your wound.

I feel the same way about loneliness and depression. Why is it so bad to seek somebody's comfort and love when we are emotionally hurt? Why do we get labelled as attention seekers?

Our loved ones are not mind readers. Depression is harder to see in some people than others. Just because they are not approaching you about your depression does not mean they do not want to help you with it. Likely, it just means they can't see it right now. This is why our bodies have an ""attention seeking"" function. It is a survival mechanism. It is how we get the love and care we need to heal. 

OP, please don't be too hard on yourself. Wishing you peace <3"

Recognizing that I need to put in more effort to save myself, but not having the energy or will to actually do it. Maybe I'm scared of getting better?

I'm such a failure already, it would take so much more work to turn my life around than it would to just accept where I'm at and continue to suffer. I know that will hurt the people who love me. Is it selfish to just lie down anyways? I don't feel like I have a choice.

Tired of fighting."

Frugal,fc05hn9,t1_fbhfj54,1577279466.0,I'm not sure. My appeal was denied.

I have severe migraines and some arising visual issues as well as a family history of MS, so this was a necessary procedure according to my insurance company (cigna). I don't know how any of this happened. My appeal was denied.

My boyfriend was in a near-death car accident 2 years ago and is facing something similar. For example, in the US a helicopter flight to the hospital costs 50,000 dollars. Insurance pays for it, but that doesn't include the months spent at the hospital and the 12 surgeries he recieved. Or the multiple $2500 ambulance rides he got after being sent home too early and needing to go back to the ER. It's robbery. 

Not sure what to do besides never go to the hospital again. Maybe move to Canada."

Wishing you peace ❤"
depression,fb8iinc,t3_ebvyev,1576614688.0,"When I feel like this, I take a cold shower. Maybe go for a walk. Or cook a meal for someone I love. Clean. Basic, easy, menial tasks that allow your brain some space from itself. Sometimes, just a change of scenery can give me the space I need to think rationally, and I don't want to kill myself as much anymore. Though I do still a little.

Like others have said, please seek help. If money is a problem, there are often a variety of community support groups that are free... even something like that can make a change in your life. I always feel better in the days after seeing my therapist.

I hope you find peace."

selfharm,f90ev46,t3_e324j9,1574971391.0,"Self harm is psychologically addictive. For me, it's not that I necessarily purposely trigger myself, but I desperately miss the relief and comfort it gave me at certain times. Even though I know I want to get better and stop hurting, I trigger myself because I'm already vulnerable and just getting it over with eases the mental burden of just thinking about it all the time. It helped me to keep these addictive tendencies in mind so I could have a reason for the way I felt. It's not that I WANT to hurt myself, it's that I want to stop hurting and I relied on this method of coping for so long that I feel a hole in my life without it. But that hole will fill, and I will feel complete again without self harm.

I don't really know what else to say because I know just how hard that mental battle can be. Just try to be gentle with yourself ❤ wishing you peace"
selfharm,f90ddt1,t3_e3160k,1574970814.0,"Like another commenter said, not having the burden of having to hide your cuts makes it so much harder to tell yourself not to.

I had been entirely clean, not just on my arms, but I totally understand the fear of letting people see. There were even circumstances where I would become unsafe if a particular person saw/found out. If you're in that place... I'm so, so sorry. 

I'm not really sure what to say because it's really painful to feel like that. But just remember, the reality of the situation is that you don't deserve to feel guilty or ashamed. Your scars are a reflection of how you're hurting inside. Your internal, mental health is much more important than any scar. You deserve to be happy. I know hearing that doesn't make it feel any better but know at least that you're not alone. 

Best of luck ❤ truly wishing you peace"
