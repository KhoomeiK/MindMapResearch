If your doing all of that and you've apologized it's now up to your friend & your friends dad. Only an apology is yours to give. Forgiveness is your friends to give. If she accept you & everything that comes with you including mental illness & she is a true friend. She will forgive you, now don't think it's not going to be awkward around your friends dad for awhile. 
It will be awkward as hell and your just going to have to take one for the team if this friendship is important to you. 

But the answer your seeking for forgiving yourself is called self compassion. This is a skill that can be learned. There are self compassion retreats in person or online. Until you have compassion for yourself as a human that makes mistakes you won't find forgiveness. Dont worry though this is a skill you can learn we don't just possess self compassion which is strange because we have compassion for others just not for ourselves.

Sometimes l scare myself & lm introverted but l don't have anti- social personality disorder l have bi-polar2 & a personality disorder. I've been taught through out my life that lm a outcast, socially rejectable person so l get to the emotion anger quickly. 
It's amazing how your brain adapts so quickly & gets you there in a slit second but for me it took a life time of training. Now to untrain my mind will take another lifetime. 
I wish you the best of luck in getting a diagnosis & getting a handle on your anger."

Respect the group & the group rules, you brought this on yourself but lm sure you don't want to hear that you should take responsibility for your own actions. So I'll just tell you if you fear for your life with those threats you have to report it, in the case anything comes of it."
