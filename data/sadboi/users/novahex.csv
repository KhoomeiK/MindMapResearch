WritingPrompts,fp9b5vm,t3_gbzcmm,1588421018.0,"Hiding in plain sight. It's a phrase we've all heard, but most people don't realize just how true it is. And it is this phenomenon that I've exploited to succeed in my career. 

 I've been the top secret intelligence agent for the United States since the cold war. I've seen many great men and women go down while on secret operative missions around the world. Their greatest mistake was trying to stay covert at all times. Being undetectable on any mission is important, but it's the errors we make in our day to day that takes most spies down. No matter how hard you try it's just a matter of time until you make a mistake, no one can be perfect 100% of the time, it only takes the slightest slip up before foreign operatives can link a suspected spy alias to their daily cover. But I've found a way around that.

 Back in the days before social media it was a little more challenging to be written off as a loon but I did quite well. I had to get creative so that I was written off as the local nutcase conspiracy theorist. I used my free time between missions calling in to radio shows, writing in to newspapers, and holding protest signs outside of local government buildings. I would go on my missions and come home spewing grand tales about how I just got back from wherever. Sometimes it was stories about commandeering Russian nuclear arms plans, sometimes it was a story about tracking leads on Bin Laden through the desert, or investigating cartel primary drug sources. And sometimes the stories were more fantastical, investigating possible alien technologies that cropped up in Egypt or how I followed up leads on North Korea attempting to find a way to genetically modify the Kim family foetuses to create genetically superior leaders who didn't need to waste time on menial human facts of life like defecation. Of course only some of the stories I've spewed were true. It's a lot of fun touting truth and fiction side by side. In fact most of the time I travel is for leisure and I come back from the Bahamas touting made up tales from war torn countries. It also helps that my parents passed when I was in my twenties and left me a trust to to be paid out incrementally over time, so when I started as an agent the government directed my pay through the private trust as to leave no trail of employment. 

Nowadays it's easier than ever and I've perfected my art. I post on Facebook incessantly, I love sharing memes about aliens and politics, conspiracy tales, and my own colourful rants. All day long. I follow newscasters and stand behind them shouting and waving signs like those ""End-of-time"" loons you see on street corners. Quite a few times I've been interviewed which is always a fun endeavor. I've emboldened a certain passion into destroying any credibility I could ever have in my daily persona. 

Over the years I've been tailed a few times by foreign spies, and every time their official reports about some nut job who got a lucky guess amongst the rubbish conspiracies bolsters my pride in my very public cover up. I've been able to accomplish so much more than any other spy known to the American government. It helps that I've perfected the disheveled homeless redneck look and have numerous aliases while abroad to cover my tracks. Abroad and while travelling I am always clean cut and professional, but while home my state of the art coloured contact lenses, lace front wig and incredibly realistic mangled fake beard, special effects makeup to change the shape of my nose, and the dirty haggard clothes a size too big all help keep me from being connected to the secret operative known abroad. I even have top of the line replacement fingerprint gloves that I wear at all times while not on mission so any attempt to connect me to actual events abroad are next to impossible. 

It's remarkable how narrow minded people can be, and how easily people overlook the vocal wackadoos of the world. It's a truly wonderful thing for a spy to exploit. So why am I sharing this all now you may ask? Well I've officially retired today and am about to disappear from all of it forever. I'm off to relax on some tropical beach for the rest of my days under my last and final alias. I just wanted someone to know my story before it becomes something that never happened. So thank you for giving me that."

BipolarSOs,foef7i9,t3_g6r7el,1587702296.0,"I have bipolar and can tell you this is not just bipolar, I do not lie and I always try to do my part in a relationship. But I was with someone that was exactly like this. He lied about everything, huge and small. He did the minimum and only the minimum and expected praise and reward. If I complained about what wasn't done it was my fault because he did the dishes last week. It was horrible and only got worse with time. For me the lying got worse and worse. It progressed from White lies and taking $20 from me (which I couldn't prove so he wouldn't admit until 3 years later) to lying about being in school when really he had failed a year earlier, was unemployed and collecting welfare which was spent on weed and fast food, while I worked 2 jobs and tried to do everything. Even during that time he did the minimum around the house and still told me I was the reason so many things didn't get done because I was lazy. And even when I collected all the proof and handed it to him he still tried to lie his way out of it. If  you cannot trust someone (which you shouldn't if he's a serial liar) you cannot build a lasting relationship or a future because they will lie about what your future will be to placate you in the moment. As someone who spent 4 years too long thinking things would get better and wanting to believe the nice things they promised I suggest you two get some serious marriage counselling or part ways. Because it will not get better on its own. If he is on meds now that's good, but if you want to stay and make it work know you are with someone who has gotten by with lying and lying is easier than facing hard conversations. You will have to do extra to deal with this, such as taking him to his psychiatrist and counselling appointments and waiting there, and watching him take his meds every day, so you know they're actually happening. Because he will be tempted to tell you he's going to them and when it gets tough he may go straight back to lying and say he's still going.

Also wanted to add trust your suspicions and intuition. I doubted mine for a long time and I was right about every one, even when I was made out to be crazy and a bad person for bringing them up."

He seemed a little awkward but funny and nice so I said fuck it why not. We go for late night bubble tea and the date was literally only an hour because the bubble tea place was closing. He was super awkward, referred to himself in third person repeatedly, sometimes doing so while making a jab at himself which was uncomfortable. He tells me he's newly religious and looking for something serious, and that he's only been with one person before so he's not a virgin (ok... Didn't need to know this in the first hour but whatever). He tells me he was so excited about me saying yes he rushed in to his roommates bedroom for last minute advice. Note we're both in our mid twenties and this guy is acting like a giddy socially awkward high schooler. 


Dates over and I just get home when I get a text from him saying "" hey so sorry to spring this on you but I have a rather serious question if you have time""  I ask what's up. He texts back asking if I want children. Wtf. Literally only met for an hour and he's asking about kids. I awkwardly reply yeah one day but why is that something you had to ask right away. He states he doesn't want to fall for someone he can't possibly have a future with. This is a little crazy so I try to make things less awkward with humour about how he needs to simmer down and he's getting a little ahead of himself. He texts back that he knows I'd be a great mom because of my line of work and we could have lots of babies. I text back only if I can leave babies at my work and have a full night's rest and Netflix in peace each night (trying to use humour to handle how absolutely nuts this conversation got). He replies saying that he'd make sure I had lots of night off to unwind and between both our parents the kids can have plenty of sleepovers at their grandparents house. I'm full on freaked out, this is nuts what the actual hell is going on. I cut the convo short and he incessantly messages me over the next few days. I end up telling him I'm not interested in anything serious and I wish him the best of luck finding a wife soon. He thanks me for not ghosting and says if things ever change to message him. Yeah, sorry but no thank you."

BipolarReddit,fj34k3t,t3_faxptx,1582966913.0,So super interesting I'm in a longitudinal bipolar study that is tracking a possible correlation between bipolar episodes and demyelination in the brain over time which may explain why bipolar episodes get worse over time. It's still early in the research project so nothing conclusive but it's cool to be a part of something that may provide answers and improve bipolar treatment in the future

BipolarSOs,filyx5o,t3_f8i7mh,1582513751.0,"Hey, I'm bipolar, and when I was a little bit younger than your girlfriend I had a relationship break down because of a similar situation. I depended too much on my partner to get me through my anxiety and episodes. At the very least if your relationship is going to work you need to set boundaries and put some time in for yourself. You need to practice self care too. It sounds like the relationship has become very codependent and draining for you. This isn't sustainable or healthy. It's important you have a conversation and maybe plan a few things each week just for you. Express to your partner that you love and support her but you need to do some things for your own mental health. Whether it be spending a few hours spread out through the week where you can practice your hobbies/interests or see friends, or even one evening where you can have some alone time and decompress. Otherwise this relationship will break down and you will continue to be burnt out. It's important that you aren't reduced to a caretaker in a relationship. You need to be able to find a way to sustain the romance and partnership beyond the dynamic you have now. She also should try to access counselling or CBT or something so she is able to better work through some of her day to day symptoms without you, it will make her feel more independent and capable with time, and if she doesn't believe she can do it or that it won't help let her know it really helped me. Knowing I could stand on my own two feet made the bad days a bit easier, and the slightly better days even better. It was honestly the best thing I ever did for myself and for my relationships. It wasn't always easy but getting the meds right to stabilize the worst of things and then finding that self love and inner strength will be so good for her. 

I wish both of you the best of luck. Take care of yourself too OP, I know you're trying to do right by the woman you love but you're mental health and quality of life is important too"

trashy,fh828d2,t1_fh7vbtg,1581350396.0,"I mean maybe I'm not a feminist in the modern sense. I don't ascribe with radical feminism or man hating feminism. I do believe feminism is still important because there are still huge parts of the world that still have huge gender disparities and women still face severe oppression. And for a majority of western history women were oppressed and there are still lingering issues (though not as blatant as women not having the vote or being considered property) because societal structures were built on this oppression and gender disparity. But I believe these issues are still pervasive in our societal structures and extend to not only women, but men, minorities, lgbt+ who all suffer because of it and we need to continue to address how to create meaningful change to rid society of biases and prejudice. I feel like a lot of movements and ""solutions"" are either virtue signalling or bandaid solutions to try and force change on unwilling participants. By continuing an inclusive and open dialogue we may actually get somewhere though. I think the us vs. them mentality is harmful to progress . So yeah, maybe a lot of people would say I'm not a ""real"" feminist now a days but I still believe in what was started with feminism and it's intentions and think it can still be beneficial. Gender politics has a long way to go still but if we keep talking about it we'll get there. I mean obviously this is a simplified rambling of a much more complex issue but yeah. I would have loved to pick your aunt's brain, I did not grow up with any strong female role models as a child or women who ever considered themselves feminist by any means. 

Also how the fuck does someone do enough mental gymnastics to say they're a feminist and supports Sharia law. That's psychotic."

DeadBedrooms,fh177n9,t1_fh0pymv,1581211587.0,If you're going to blame literally all women for your struggles you may want to take some time to look at your own issues. Also re-read the comment directly above because I think you misread it. They're saying you're probably the one that is fucked up.

Paranormal,fgrrkhh,t3_f03m61,1581055128.0,"OP I work in brain injury rehabilitation and depending on which parts of the brain were affected by the aneurysm this isn't unusual. Totally freaky how real the things that the brain comes up with, but not unusual. Definitely I would look at brain injury rehabilitation therapy for your friend's father to help him overcome the challenges of his neurological difficulties. There are also neurological assessments that can be done to see exactly where his brain is not functioning as well, and then skills and strategies that can be implemented to compensate and in many cases overcome these deficits. Sometimes it's not always apparent just which parts of the brain are impacted by various traumas so assessments are very helpful to get a full picture. I wish the best for your friend and their family, these sorts of things are never easy to go through, I hope her dad make a speedy and complete recovery from his aneurysm"

JustNoSO,fg7qb0y,t1_fg67zhq,1580598786.0,Same! Getting rid of my man child has been the best thing ever. I love having control over my whole place and not having to come home to his mess after a 12 hour work day. I love cooking whatever I want. And I thought I would struggle financially (even though he didn't work he paid half the rent) but it turns out he was a pretty big money sink too. It's liberating and so stress free to get rid of a dead end relationship where you did all the work and all they did was have constant excuses
