ChronicIllness,fnfejc0,t3_g16vxb,1586906541.0,"Iâ€™m so sorry youâ€™re dealing with all of this. I know itâ€™s sucks. Iâ€™ve been there too. I was in between GIs with a referral into one but canâ€™t get in because they arenâ€™t accepting new patients during covid.  If you need to talk or rant for anything, my dms are open"
littlespace,fnbjx9x,t1_fnbdecu,1586816849.0,"Thanks. I love more than anything dressing her up and making her cute. That and my house. And thanks, I am."
littlespace,fnbju1z,t1_fnb8m21,1586816806.0,Yikes hope yâ€™all are well too
littlespace,fnatg1v,t3_g0gxo7,1586803521.0,Yeah XD. Hope you can get it soon!
littlespace,fnat1wy,t1_fnast4u,1586803323.0,Definitely worth it. Gives me something to do and focus on when itâ€™s been a bad day and makes me feel so little especially with the pacis and toys and all the cute clothing.
littlespace,fnaehov,t3_g0lm4n,1586796088.0,For me itâ€™s about keeping in contact and keeping my attention in whatever is making me feel little. That can be interacting more with my studies or my paci or focusing on coloring or playing my switch. Whatever made me get into little space I kind of hold onto and bring in and focus on only the things that will put me there. I also find having my daddy help me by cqlling me princess and treating me little as well. Hope that helps
littlespace,fnadgvj,t1_fna3tmm,1586795576.0,Yeah it kind of just does it automatically
littlespace,fnadfwy,t1_fn9xugr,1586795563.0,Thanks. I really appreciate it. Tornado hit next to us and knocked out power in some areas but luckily it just missed us and weâ€™re all good. My daddy and I are doing well at home and staying safe
littlespace,fn9vnu1,t1_fn9l3dm,1586785636.0,Yup all is well. I think it might have hit a little bit away. Just some loud wind and lots of rain. Thanks!
cgl,fn1wefz,t1_fmzzesc,1586571724.0,"Of course I got into little space myself not too too long ago but if you have any other questions or just want to talk about anything, my dms are open"
cgl,fmzwbjt,t3_fxwd5f,1586530856.0,"I myself am a little and while Iâ€™m currently with my first mommy Iâ€™ve found a few things to be super beneficial to me (especially given ptsd issues) 
     - always set boundaries and pay attention to each otherâ€™s emotions and attitudes during any kind of play time. My mommy knows if I start to leave little space out of the blue or seem to not be enjoying it that things need to stop (which can happen randomly) even if I canâ€™t say it. Make sure you understand each otherâ€™s boundaries at a minimum and can pickup on any cues that things may be heading out of your comfort zone 
     - be aware and understanding of what works best for yâ€™all, what items you want to have and what type of little you want to act and try to find one (when looking) that matches well with those needs and desires 
     - be patient. It may not seem natural and it may feel a bit weird at first. That doesnâ€™t mean itâ€™s not for you necessarily. Give both you and your mommy/daddy time to get used to it, like you would with any new experience. 

As far as what itâ€™s like, it almost freeing and creates a good headspace. My mommy is also my caregiver health wise because of multiple chronic issues I have and having it be part of play or seem more wanted makes it feel less burdensome on both sides. Regardless, expect lots of snuggles and kisses and cuddles from your mommy/daddy. Expect it to be living a nuturing 

( also for getting into little space when you have trouble I recommend coloring, animal crossing for the switch if you can, any toys or props that work for you (I personally have a woobie and pacis that help me get there when I want to))"
ChronicIllness,fmwksig,t1_fmwhq5e,1586448357.0,Thanks. I needed this. I think finding that either or would help. Since mine is mostly caused by nutritional issues itâ€™s a bit harder but useful advice so thanks. And yeah I get that. Thanks!
ChronicIllness,fmw20jj,t1_fmutxbg,1586437662.0,Iâ€™m glad youâ€™ve been able to do so. I canâ€™t wait til I (hopefully) get to the point I can feel that way. I mean I get that itâ€™s just hair and it will grow back it just still feels odd thinking about it. Was there some change that sparked the acceptance this time? I feel like I keep saying the same thing but going through with it seems like a whole different issue...
ChronicIllness,fmw1r4x,t1_fmvd259,1586437477.0,"I often do at this point. Beanies are my go too at this point when I have to leave the house or go an a video call. I guess itâ€™s more just a personal insecurity, even with hats and scarves I donâ€™t like seeing it fall out or looking in the mirror and seeing where itâ€™s thinning or feeling it damaged. I guess for me itâ€™s more so about me and how I see it and less what others think or about others seeing it if that makes any sense...sorry if that seemed rambley"
ChronicIllness,fmuqcao,t1_fmuplui,1586396603.0,What made you choose that route? Like was there a moment where you just knew it was time?
littlespace,fmkyv4m,t3_frg8ro,1586173681.0,"As her little I can confirm. Good way to destress and forget about life for a bit. (Sorry it took so long to reply, I was playing animal crossing ðŸ˜‚)"
disability,fmkycsr,t3_fvfitx,1586173196.0,Haha good to know. Sheâ€™s definitely warming up but still scurries out of the way pretty quickly when Iâ€™m rolling by. My roommates cat literally doesnâ€™t even flinch. I could be going through a narrow pathway and have to either pick him up and move him or very very carefully watch my wheel because heâ€™d rather get run over than move ðŸ˜‚
disability,fmk8p81,t3_fvfitx,1586147466.0,"OMG My cat will do the same. Iâ€™m very lucky that I am an ambulatory user but my cat always picks the times I need it the most to use it as her bed and when itâ€™s hers itâ€™s hers. Sheâ€™s almost terrified of it when Iâ€™m in it (although she is very slowly getting better) but when itâ€™s become one of her favorite nap time spots, especially with quarantine XD"
selfharm,fkpsfkc,t3_fjpf0b,1584418076.0,I have the best fiancÃ©e in the world and when she first saw my self harm we both just got sad. She goes through a lot of the same stuff and didnâ€™t know I had relapsed. (Hadnâ€™t self harmed in a good few months and she hadnâ€™t seen any of my self harm and didnâ€™t have any new scars since I met her). She held me and told me to try my best not to do it any more. And we just talked about it. Sheâ€™s had some of the same urges but is doing a lot better at finding new ways to handle the urges. I unfortunately have not. I know it hurts her but she is also being very understanding and trying to help me every chance she gets. She hasnâ€™t taken my tools (sheâ€™s offered to but she know that wouldnâ€™t help much) but sheâ€™s there for me no matter what and does her best to help me find other outlets.

ptsd,fjbg2ly,t3_fcenym,1583192488.0,"I completely get this. Iâ€™ve been seeing it this way for a while just needed someone else to put it into words I guess. Iâ€™ve been diagnosed with MDD (with suicidality), GAD, and PTSD  as well as a few physical chronic illness and I see my life as this a lot too especially when things are rough. Like when Iâ€™m in a real low spot with my depression or chronic illnesses I see each task I get through and each thing I do thatâ€™s hard as an achievement. Each time I figure out a new coping skill or get through another trigger I get a new piece of armor. Every time I am able to push through and flashback I have fought a boss. I know itâ€™s probably different the way each person sees it play out but itâ€™s always been easier to see it as a game or a challenge and makes me cling on that much more to life and to getting through everything"
service_dogs,fi3nxfi,t3_f671nr,1582123796.0,"Coming from someone who currently has an ESA the first thing you would need to do is get into a therapist and possibly look for one who works with people on ESAs although any therapist can prescribe one/write you a letter. However, itâ€™s likely going to take multiple sessions before they are willing to do so. Further, avoid the on-campus services if they are available to you as in my experience they often will not/ cannot write you a letter due to regulations by their employer. If you really do need your cat to emotionally support you than a good therapist would recognize that and help you get started on the process. You can also try asking the emotional support dog subreddit as they may have more answers"
ptsd,fg7rydi,t1_fg7q22q,1580599972.0,"I want to start by saying I apologize for everything you have gone through and wish you nothing but the best in your journey. While I think the above person may not have handled it the best I do think there are a few things that could be helpful from what he said and overall could have been handled better. While hypervigilance and seeing those traumatic memories replayed in life can be symptoms or more prevalent for you personally, it does not mean someone canâ€™t be dealing with PTSD with these being less prevalent or not part of their experience.  Further just because you see those pattern does not mean the above commenter did as certain things may be more ambiguous in the way the men in the group responded. I think it might be helpful if you could work on some of that hypervigilance. While I donâ€™t think it needed to be worded the way it did, Iâ€™ve found personally that dissecting the things people do and noticing every little thing that happens was a big issue i had when I began dealing with my trauma. It might be a helpful thing for you to work on to bring up those triggers a little less. I also do agree that at this time individual therapy or support may be the better route for you. Group work really does rely on you being comfortable and open with the others in the group to really benefit. Given your experiences with this group as well as the hypervigilance that might make it harder to get comfortable with members in a group, this might be a better option for y oh at the moment. I really do wish you the best and hope you donâ€™t have to deal with any more experiences like this in the future."
ptsd,fdxhs0r,t1_fdxgs0i,1578768809.0,"Iâ€™m so sorry youâ€™ve been dealing with this so so long. I definitely get this unfortunately. The nightmares usually donâ€™t affect me as much as the flashbacks and memories. I have sleeping issues possibly related so usually by the time I can get myself to sleep Iâ€™m so worn out and tired that the nightmares donâ€™t seem as bad I guess. I hate how it runs through my head non stop...I definitely get the sense of safety being gone. Even though I know who abused me, I still hate large crowds or places for fear that I wonâ€™t be able to know whatâ€™s going on around me. Iâ€™m sorry your dealing with it all as well and am here if you need to talk."
EatingDisorders,fddfgxw,t1_fddeor6,1578309897.0,"I agree although itâ€™s very possible heâ€™s dealing with some food related issues himself. Try to gently bring it up and let him know how itâ€™s affecting you. If he is a good fit for you and has your best interest at heart, he will hopefully work to help you feel more comfortable and encourage you to be ok in the body you have."
TrueChronicIllness,f9krk59,t1_f9kdytk,1575406441.0,"Thatâ€™s good in theory, however thatâ€™s not always obtainable for everyone. I personally have a wide array of GI issues both diagnosed and undiagnosed that make it very difficult for me to get the amount of water my cardiologist wants me to get (which would already be difficult for someone with a fully functioning GI system) and lose a decent amount of fluids as well. Before doing regular saline infusions I was consistently severely dehydrated (which is quite a bit worse for your kidneys) and ended up in the ER frequently. While avoiding long term saline infusions would be ideal, itâ€™s not always the option for everyone. Believe me I donâ€™t want to be wasting multiple hours a week like I currently am getting them done but for some people including myself thatâ€™s really the best if not only option."
TrueChronicIllness,f9joqvc,t1_f9j2vt8,1575381749.0,"I agree with this. I just got one placed solely for saline infusions. Now it will have the added benefit of being able to be used for other medications and frequent blood work if need be but the main purpose was for saline. My veins, at 21 years old, are shitty and the center I work with usually has to stick multiple times just to find a vein that will cooperate for some of the infusion and both the infusion nurses and my cardiologist were pushing for one. Why would this be considered OTT? To the OP Iâ€™ve only had mine placed for about a week. The surgery itself is fairly simple and in my personal opinion pain was no worse than a sore muscle. They prescribed medication but I really didnâ€™t need more than a Tylenol. As long as you do what your told to and take good care of yourself before and after youâ€™ll do great!"

Hypermobility,f25o7o0,t1_f2576kq,1569979525.0,The ones I have (some brand on Etsy but I donâ€™t remember which one) donâ€™t restrict movement too much. Just enough to keep from hyperextending. Iâ€™ve been able to draw and sign (asl) just fine with them on I can just feel it restricting in the moments I would normally hyperextend. Definitely look on Etsy. Iâ€™d recommend the metal ones but they can start getting pricy especially off site
Hypermobility,f254k3x,t3_dbyuzp,1569965769.0,Personally I have found bracing them works best for me. I use ring splints during activities I know to be extra painful or hard on those joints and then ice or heat after.

tattoos,eo9gvc0,t1_eo9bf80,1558391105.0,Of course. I still struggle with my depression and self harm. Luckily I donâ€™t have tons of scars left from mine but it reminds me when Iâ€™m in those moments or when I slip up. Iâ€™d rather acknowledge the past and remind myself that I got through it but Iâ€™ve definitely considered doing ratios to cover the few I have.
