EatingDisorders,fiym7fo,t3_faa2ke,1582842170.0,"As a guy with an eating disorder, I can relate to a majority of what your going through. I did just about everything you mentioned except I was on heroin for years and after getting clean I gained a bunch of weight super fast. I was already really underweight from using for so long and didnt feel real hunger for a long long time. Plus I didnt give a flying fuck about what I looked like when I was that deep in my addiction. Getting sober allowed me to see that i looked like shit, my clothes were shit, and i started to care way to much about how i looked. I didnt even notice how underweight i was and probably still dont. It was all too much for me to handle at once. I got kicked out of rehab because I stopped eating completely and I was considered a liability. Luckily they didnt find out about the self harm. Had to go do a month of inpatient and then 2 months of residential to get functional again. I've relapsed quite a few times since than a d always lose weight from it. So it always because a huge issue whenever I get clean. Your not alone my dude."

I got up to level 56 just from doing solo and played with a friend online. We turned the difficulty up a little since it was 2 of us. I go back to solo and forgot to turn the difficulty back down and died. Losing the character and the hours I put into it. I was so mad I haven't touched it since.

When we get to the front of the line I suddenly realized there was weed in my guitar case from a while ago and I tapped my moms shoulder and said ""mom, we need to get out of line, like right now."" She knew I did a lot of drugs and I'm pretty sure the look on my face said it all. I had to break it to her and say that there was weed in my guitar case and we had to do something about it. So she emptied her cigarette box and we slipped in in there and threw it away, cause I sure as hell didn't have the option to smoke it. She was freaking out the entire plane ride thinking someone was gonna pull us aside or something. But it's a good thing I remembered because when we got to New York I opened the flap it was in and there was a TSA slip right where the weed was."

It wasn't hearing the same bullshit everytime about how shitty people's lives were and they found god and now they lives are great. It was much more connective and much like a process group where others help you go through the things your actually going through. It helps you notice that addiction and many other things people struggle with, like eating disorders, depression,  ancient, anger, as maladaptive behaviors. They help you learn how to change your thinking."

Obviously it was an accumulation of a lot of different things going on at the time but now I have to deal with both. And they play into each other in so many different ways, especially stimulants. Cause it's almost normal to be a heroin, meth and coke addict and be underweight as fuck cause you just dont really get that hungry. It's when tour sober and your still not eating, and feeling that hunger and choosing to overcome it that it becomes a different issue."

And then we both are moving out of this city to try and get away from everything that has ruined our lives here and try and start over. She couldn't get into a detox mainly because she moved from out of state to live with me so she doesn't have insurance. Anyways, I get out and she's still using  and I always tend to relapse as soon as I get out. So  relapse, I tell her because she asked and said she's getting clean the next day. She actually does and has been good ever since. I'm still using everyday and Everytime she asks I say I've been doing great and that I can't wait to move. I know she would pack her bags and leave if she knew but I just don't want to lose her. I really do want to stay clean and I've looked at PHPs and IOPs but God damn it I have to go through withdrawals all over again without her finding out."
