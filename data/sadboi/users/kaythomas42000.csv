Love God, Love Others. 
I prefer mercy over sacrifice. 
No greater love than this is known in the world, that a man would lay down his life for his friends.
My father and I are one. 
All of this is eternal and infinite TRUTH. 
Jesus, thank God, died so we could Live. And He, We, Us, The One, LIVES evermore."

unpopularopinion,fm7in11,t3_ftce8d,1585828301.0,"I sincerely wish that one day the rest of the world will come to realize that just as you have your factions of cultures, so do Black people. We have gangs, runners, traps, rappers, community activists, educators, lawyers, politicians, doctors, religious leaders, Grandma‚Äôs and the crazy candy ladies just like you do. I pray that COVID-19 helps the world realize that we are really more alike than we are different. I pray that those who don‚Äôt know, do some research on the contributions of black people (your cell phone, your toilet and your stop lights). I pray that you come to realize that black women are the most educated group in America. I pray you come to realize that a black woman probably nursed your great great grandparents from her own breasts. I pray you come to realize that you probably hold Blackness within you. 

Yours, 
A Black Woman, a holder of 3 higher education degrees (BS, MSEd, PhD), a six-figured, single and child-free daughter of enslaved ancestors from the heart of the south."
