Head you can keep thinking your stuff. But I’m going to be mindful of the small thing I’m doing.

I’m reading a book called the mindful way through depression. It helps you to learn calming mindful practice which allow the feelings to wash over you. You acknowledge them by being aware if it causes pain or tightening of a part in your body. Then you use mindfulness to take you out the other side of it.

Might be a good idea to just say exactly what you wrote back to me. That after lockdown let’s meet up for an afternoon or evening and chat about anything else like bpd or issues I might have.

Could it help if you both decided to put bpd in her  and your past hang ups to one side only for now. Then you have made a conscious decision between you which will strengthen your bonds to enjoy each other. Hope that makes sense.

BPD,fg6ca27,t3_ewrbwz,1580563434.0,"Society is a worse disease than BPD, at least we have a small chance of managing our illness. As for society there’s no hope there. Try not dwell on society, just be safe and kind to yourself and immediate others."
BPD,fg6anvb,t3_ex2meq,1580561655.0,I am 50f uk and I wish I never had my diagnosis a year and half ago. The spiral I’m in is a killer. I’m hoping I manage to get the help I need in the future. I will keep asking and trying to cope with it all.
BPD,fg6a4oe,t3_ex5gob,1580561030.0,Yes I feel completely lost most of the time atm

BPD,ffwlmnc,t3_evmvdp,1580304829.0,"You sound like you could be depressed, reason I say this is that I have Bpd and am suffering depression on top . Tell your doctor as soon as possible and be kind to yourself."
BPD,ffv1vqz,t3_evcbqm,1580253771.0,"Be kind regards this, be kind to yourself. Remember that in your grandmothers time people weren’t diagnosed with mental illness.Those who were just not normal were locked away from society. 
She may scold you out of fear and love. But tough love is also an old fashion thing.
When you feel calmer and less stressed out, try and tell her that it isn’t helping you when she scolds you. In fact tell her it’s more damaging than helpful. 
Then tell her a few tips that might be of help so she can work on helping you, instead of laying into you"
BPD,ffv0sqv,t3_evctye,1580253072.0,"Forget the nurse, just think about getting well and seeing your dog again. Use this as your lever to get well and be with your dog. 
Look at the nurse as a human who also possibly has stress in her life and maybe her mind is not in a good place who knows. 
But keep focusing on your return to the dog who loves you unconditionally. Humans can get on with destroying humanity, use your love to take care of your dog."
BPD,ffv08ru,t3_evd71i,1580252747.0,"With BPD there is no choice, but to be kind regards acceptance to what is, to how you feel as it’s real and hell and painful. 
But what you can do is take control over how you react when it happens. Which is what you have done. You wanted to opt out, but you haven’t. Your soul self won over the life crippling illness BPD. Well done you."
BPD,ffujc7d,t3_eurmh9,1580243173.0,"You answered your own question, yes it never goes away. But it’s manageable, and it starts by accepting that it’s part of you. But it doesn’t define all of you."
BPD,ffrurrk,t3_euvvfu,1580166290.0,"It might help you to speak with your grandma about how you feel about her one day not being there. Older people are often very wise, as mad as it sounds she might be able to tell you how to cope at that time. Or she may tell you her wishes for you when that time comes."
BPD,ffq2ojl,t3_eulkny,1580117081.0,"Be kind to yourself, and just tell the truth. Then your mind can’t beat you with shame. Don’t let the inner talk , take the real you away"
BPD,ffidzwo,t3_ett6fw,1579971609.0,"The only advice I can give is be kind to yourself. I have spent a year and a half going through these ups and downs since diagnosis. I just try to do small tasks. I don’t bully myself if I don’t achieve them.
I just aim to achieve them the next time I feel up."
BPD,ff9zgnn,t3_esgt7e,1579724802.0,"This is great, set daily small goals. Don’t beat yourself up if you don’t manage to do them. But try the next day to do them. Be kind to yourself"
BPD,ff6s915,t3_erz2be,1579633812.0,"If you type in BPD recovery, you get clips and talks about recovery. If you just type BPD you get lots of awful stuff warning everyone off and saying we’re bad people to be avoided etc etc ... but we’re not"
BPD,ff6r6fl,t3_erz2be,1579633166.0,"You could both watch dr Daniel fox on YouTube.
He’s all about facing things and fixing things. 
Also YouTube put in bpd recovery. Try read the recovering stories.
There are loads of negative footage about BPD. So try avoiding them."
BPD,ff3p686,t3_erb9pz,1579545859.0,It’s lovely to think that there are others around me and in my age group in my country. Obv goes without saying that it’s great to have this bpd blog on Reddit etc.. I use this when I’m low to acknowledge the thousands of others who are out there coping best they can with this awful mental illness
BPD,ff2x7b7,t3_erb9pz,1579527473.0,"100%. Yes , it was tiring and exhausting but this is torture."
BPD,ff2x03i,t3_erb9pz,1579527277.0,"I was seen by a mental health nurse who said I have Bpd,and thenleft for a year without follow up from mental health team. 
I lost my job, split with husband and went into spiral.Then I became suicidal and had three weeks with crisis team. I saw a phsyciatrist who confirmed BPD,signed off and placed back with mhict mental health team, I have an appointment next week to chat to the same nurse who left me with the news of my Bpd in November 2018. I have been told that there is no funding in Gloucestershire for DBT as it was cut in 2008. 
So apart from a phone call once a week to make sure I’ve not killed myself. Plus possibly meeting once a month with the mhict team, I’m on my own as a lot of others on here who can’t afford private therapy."
