I introduced this as a gag, one of my players have used it to thwart multiple enemy's. Had two players out of six standing with one hit of HP left a piece. Bad guy was also severly wounded but his turn was coming up next and he had a range of heavy hitting melee moves and multiattack so the chances of them surviving were nil.

 With his last move our bugbear artifice, whips out the wand and casts it on the enemies sword replacing it with a flagpole of the same length that was in the corner of the room (they were fighting in a college headmaster's office). Bewildered the bad guy tried to make an investigation roll to find his sword which was in the corner of the room where the flagpole was. 

He rolled a nat1, couldn't find it missed his unarmed attacks and got a tortle spear through the gut. Fricken amazing."

For one the fact that she is scared about her future with you indicates that she really does care about you she's just scared about the future and what change will bring. She is getting therapy which is great, encourage her to keep going to get help. Listen to her and comfort her, sometimes her thoughts will seem irrational to you but in her anxietied mind these things are a real and present danger. Practice coping skills with her, deep breathing can be excellent in helping with anxiety attacks. Last don't make her feel less than because of her anxiety, take it seriously and view it more as someone who is sick, they don't want to be sick they just are. Fight this together, I can't promise she will ever be ""cured"" from her anxiety but she will have her good days and hopefully with you there helping she will have more and more good days.
