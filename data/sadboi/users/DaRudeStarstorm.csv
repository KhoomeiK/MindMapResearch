Tourettes,fq9mltu,t1_fq9jsy6,1589202352.0,"Oh, it completely makes sense. I have OCD as well, so I know the whole song and dance of ritualistic behaviors, compulsions and stuff. 

But yeah, the overthinking is more what I'm talking about. People with OCD usually get very intrusive thoughts that get their minds racing for hours and hours. It's like we have to check our thoughts constantly. These thoughts can be very disturbing. 

Also, if you have TS you can have something called 'mental tics'. These mental tics manifest sort of like intrusive thoughts as well, but more repetitive and one tracked in nature. These are all normal. 

So if you're overthinking because of these things or just other things troubling your mind, just know that it's normal. It's going to be okay. If you feel like it's necessary reach out to a therapist or your doctor."

I've also seen it used for stuff like bipolar and most medication used to treat bipolar usually tire you out to some capacity. I'm on an antipsychotic called Ziprasidone (also used for schizophrenia and bipolar) and that's what it does to me. If you feel like the drowsiness is too much to handle then contact your doctor.

They had to lower my dose during the daytime because I was literally sleeping most hours of the day. It was awful. My doctor had told me it would help me out with my tics too, but the only way it did that was by knocking me out. Of course I wasn't going to tic, I was asleep most of the day. I still tend to tic as I sleep, though."

All the while I'm being consumed by my paranoia. It's almost like I black out. Either that or I stay motionless in a dark room, in one poilsition, staring at a wall for most hours of the day. I also have echopraxia. But idk if that's because of this or because of my tics."

And about the emotional response. In my case, it's kind of the same way. When my partner starts talking about something stressful my tics get worse. When I hear family members talk about stressful stuff, tics worsen. It doesn't even have to be that. It can just be me feeling a little socially awkward, I start having harsh neck tics. Or it can be me being excited about dinner lol It can really be almost anything. I find that when there are more people in the room I tend to tic a lot more and harsher. To the point that my family points it out. I'm just socially awkward, I guess. On my own, my tics are still bad and still have responses to stuff like my mental tics, which are the worst. Etc."
