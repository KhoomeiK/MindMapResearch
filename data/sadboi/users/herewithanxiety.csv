bipolar,fj2rhqn,t1_fj2pb9r,1582951627.0,"Thanks for taking the time to reply, I appreciate it a lot. 

I really want him to want to be involved and supportive in my music (I’m a singer when I’m well or manic) 
But he loves metal and hard core and punk and just doesn’t like it so it’s hard to find common grounds with stuff some times, he’s so unenthusiastic all the time and while it’s great when depressed it’s rough when well or of course obviously manic... just gotta focus on me being my best without needing validations from him or involvement really"

bipolar,fib7dr9,t1_fiavi4a,1582316125.0,"That is exactly how I feel, both my parents were not very mentally stable and sadly it took them to a dark place, very grateful my mom started getting some help before her passing but it was always touch and go... i’m so sorry you’re having to come to that with a station it’s tough, I found that for me there is something feeling about radical acceptance even though it doesn’t make the situation better it helps accept and work with it. All very tough stuff.
But super admirable of your brother and yourself to be putting your health as a priority, that’s some awesome af self care *internet hugs*"
bipolar,fiafp6i,t3_f7afzy,1582300082.0,"Yeah it definitely is a little pricey, very unfortunate. I have a little tin full of gummies I’ll just keep by my bed an now I only take em before bed when I want an extra kick. My knee pain craves the tincture though at times lol

If you’re in a green state, going to different dispensary and check the first time patient deal! Some places I’ve been to are up to 30% - 20$ off(:

Physically or verbally she will open up.

Stay strong and try to do little things like a random good morning I love you sis note can go literally miles in terms of mental hug/smile."

Just let them know the situation and they can come evaluate the situation going on, it can be very helpful.
