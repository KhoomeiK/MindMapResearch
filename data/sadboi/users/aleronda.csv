It is normal to feel gross and thatâ€™s okay, get tested whenever you can and just wait for the feeling to fade away, I promise it wont last long. 
If you get horny again (maybe not the best option during the pandemic) you could maybe invite someone you already know and that youâ€™re a little more comfortable with, then after the sex you can actually hangout. 

You got thisssss"
