Ive only had two depressed/ idk eps and they were triggered by very similar subjects, so i guess i know what to bring up at my next appointment haha. Anyway I‚Äôm currently in my second (idk)episode so thats why I‚Äôve been like this the past 3 days"
BipolarReddit,flbril9,t3_fno5sy,1585010966.0,"yess, just yesterday i broke my lamp just because there was repetitive noise down stairs so i blew up at my family because of it and then proceeded to break the lamp+ other things and hit the wall. And today i started to rage because my blankets were touching me and then i started to get more angry everytime anything touched me, so as a rational response I started kicking some boxes , pound ing my head at the wall, breaking things in my room and ripping my clothes off so they wouldn‚Äôt touch me. I have had A LOT of these experiences.

When im like this literally ANYTHING will set me off into a full blown freakout"

I pretty much dont leave my bed (or room) even when im not sleeping unless im at work. I have relapsed on all of my bad habits like sh and purging which I haven‚Äôt done since November. It sucks

Im also on lamictal but i dont if its working or not cause im not on a very high dose right now and i dont feel better at all. i also have a very hard time hearing people right infront of me.  Im not sure if it connected to the lamictal or to block out my tinnitus or if its just me. I can not stand silence

Prozac didnt do anything and zoloft made me so suicidal and depressed. But maybe because they were antidepressants and not mood stabilizers.
