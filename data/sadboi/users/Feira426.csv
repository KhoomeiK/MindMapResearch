Bugs me a little that you think I let my daughter make a mistake just for my own benefit. I let her make mistakes so she can learn and grow."

DebateVaccines,fag4lmo,t1_f9ty8ct,1576040041.0,"Yes, I’m aware that it can cause problems. But can it not also fix problems? Doesn’t the body create inflammation in order to fight infections?"
DebateVaccines,fag4j2u,t1_f9ni4ah,1576039980.0,Sounds great. I appreciate it!
DebateVaccines,fag4fxv,t1_f9n3kn9,1576039902.0,"Many things have changed - the introduction of vaccines wasn’t the only variable in the past 100 years. Please don’t misunderstand me. I’m not claiming vaccines don’t work. But I hesitate to assume they do work just based on the decrease of illness. I want more evidence than two things happening at the same time. 

I also read recently that polio was redefined around the same time the vaccine came out, which could account for a lot of the decrease in diagnoses."
DebateVaccines,f9m3sz3,t1_f9m1c21,1575440510.0,"Thanks for the link. Honestly I didn’t find any helpful details in the article - it kind of seemed like it just wanted to prove an opinion it already held. But I did find the study the article was about, so that‘s good. 

I’ll admit I was a little disappointed to see the study only looked at MMR and autism, and not at any other potential negative side effects, and that the subjects were monkeys; but I still intend to read it and see what I can learn. Thanks for sharing. 

Do you have any other studies you could share? Maybe something looking at general wellness and not just autism?"
DebateVaccines,f9m2m8u,t1_f9j3zvq,1575439288.0,"I’m new here. Hello. 

So I’ve been looking into vaccines and vaccine safety off and on for several years now, and last night (shortly after discovering this subreddit) I came across what I thought was an interesting small study comparing vaccinated and unvaccinated homeschooled kids. Your replies here impressed me - you seem to know a lot about this stuff - so now I’m wondering what your thoughts are. Have you seen it?

https://www.oatext.com/pdf/JTS-3-186.pdf

The results basically indicated that while vaccination correlated with reduced incidents of the illnesses the vaccines are supposed to prevent, it also correlated with increased incidents of mental and attention disorders, allergies, pneumonia, and other problems. 

I did notice the unvaccinated kids had fewer wellness checkups and doctor visits in general, which could affect some things. Also, the study was based on the reports of the children’s mothers alone. And it was a fairly small study of 666 individuals. But to be fair, it’s the only study I’ve ever found comparing completely unvaccinated kids to vaccinated ones, so despite its obvious shortcomings I still thought it was interesting and potentially helpful."
DebateVaccines,f9lz5tg,t3_e5b93m,1575436092.0,"Ugh. If my government makes homeschooling AND refusing vaccinations illegal, I will f’ing move to another country. The school system here is terrible and ineffective, and nothing as questionably unsafe as vaccines should ever be mandatory."
DebateVaccines,f9lyuvc,t1_f9kx9q6,1575435825.0,"I read an article about an outbreak that occurred in a 99% vaccinated group. It was a while ago, so I don’t have a link, and I don’t remember the details, except I think it was a measles outbreak. Herd immunity should have prevented a major outbreak in this group, according to what I read. I believe a 95% vaccinated population was supposed to be enough. 

If a 99% certified-vaccinated population can have an outbreak... well, I can’t really believe that herd immunity is a thing that actually works."
DebateVaccines,f9lxk1t,t1_f7926ko,1575434735.0,"Can you link some of these research studies please? I’ve been looking into all of this on and off for a while now, but the only third party studies I’ve seen so far showed vaccinated children had significantly higher instances of chronic disease, pneumonia, and attention disorders than unvaccinated children. 

I’m trying to educate myself further on the whole vaccination matter, and would like to see some third party studies that seem to favor vaccination so that I can learn more. Thank you."
DebateVaccines,f9j2uxp,t1_f9c04fs,1575353921.0,"Hi Lemon. I’m skeptical of vaccines but I’m also curious about your reply. Isn’t inflammation the body’s response to stress/injury, and doesn’t it function to fix damages to the body?"

mentalhealth,ewqtwsk,t3_cplzlx,1565678935.0,"I heard something not too long ago that might apply here. Is it possible that perhaps you feel you’re not quite capable of reaching “good enough” status, or being someone you can genuinely be proud of, and so you are craving a condition that would give you a reasonable excuse to fall short of your expectations for yourself (or others’ expectations of you)? I sometimes find myself wishing for an injury or illness, just so I can be my underwhelming self without anyone saying I should be doing more, or that I’m too lazy, or that I should be stronger, have a cleaner house, have a better job, etc. 

Just an idea, and maybe it’s way off, but I thought it was worth mentioning. I’m new to Reddit, btw. Hi everyone. ☺️"
mentalhealth,ewqt20q,t1_ewqbm24,1565677825.0,I second the creative hobby idea. Very helpful for me.
mentalhealth,ewqsmk0,t1_eveobk8,1565677277.0,"Wow - this comment is so rude and full of bad assumptions, and it really pisses me off. I was with someone for five years who sat around watching TV and playing video games most of the day nearly every day. I took care of our children, did almost all of the housekeeping, and earned most of the money to support both of us. For some of this time he was completely unemployed and played games and felt sorry for himself instead of trying to get a job. Then he cheated on me with multiple women, pushed me, yelled at me, shook our baby’s crib b/c she was crying... until eventually I left. 

And here you are with this blanket statement that says I’m not empathetic, that I relied on him for money, etc. You think I should have played this asshat’s mother and maid while simultaneously being an actual mother to actual children and supporting all of us financially and trying to stay sane when he made me feel like absolute shit with his screaming and belittling and name-calling?

You should really try to be a little bit more understanding. Some women have been through hell with horrible guys and saying things like this is incredibly hurtful. Jesus. Some people are just ridiculous."
depression,ewqbgl7,t3_cpghbo,1565661541.0,"Definitely. All it takes is something small sometimes, and suddenly I feel so down I’ll spend the entire day lying on the couch oscillating between crying/hating myself and trying to distract myself with a funny video or an interesting article.  I think I’ll never be happy again. I just want to stop hurting. 

And then it fades and I gradually come to a place of relative contentment and happiness again. 

It’s like we walk on the edge of a cliff. All it takes is the slightest misstep, and we’re crashing down and have to climb all the way back up again."
depression,ewq9quc,t3_cpec84,1565660312.0,"I’m sorry you’re having a rough time. I liked what you said about being either 100 or 0. I tend to fluctuate in a similar way. I’m either trying very hard, striving my ass off and wearing myself out trying to keep up with everything I want to do, or I just give up and lie around not trying at all. 

I heard something once about setting your goals lower. I’ve been trying, when I think about it, to set very easy goals for myself. I wish I could remember the exact wording of this thing I heard, because I really liked it. Something about realizing you’re not nearly as capable as you like to think you are, and setting goals so low that “even you” can accomplish them. Sounds a little bit mean and belittling, but I think it’s not, really. I think it’s about recognizing and accepting our weaknesses, and then being realistic about the expectations we place on ourselves. 

Maybe this will help you a little. It’s helped me a little, at least when I remember it. Lol

Hope things get better for you soon."
depression,ewppax8,t3_cphc0o,1565646211.0,"I don’t have any super close friends outside my immediate family. But I actually prefer spending most of my time alone or with my family (usually). I often feel overwhelmed going out and doing things in busy places with a lot going on. I mean, I do go out and do things with people from time to time - I just don’t want to do that super often. I generally prefer quietist, calmish evenings at home, and only occasionally find myself wanting to go somewhere new or wishing I had more friends to hang out with, etc. 

The other issue I have in this area is that I find myself disliking most people when I get to know them. So a good friend for me - one I wanted to spend time with regularly - would be a sort of rare person. Maybe you’re similar? I do have a couple of people I genuinely like and feel I could be close friends with, but they are often busy with their own things, and so am I, so we don’t spend a lot of time together, and therefore we don’t ever really get that super close, hang-out-a-lot type of friendship going. 

This probably wasn’t very helpful, but I felt like adding my two cents, so there it is."
depression,ewplpt8,t1_ewor9xm,1565643902.0,"I like what you said about the disconnect that comes with acting differently than you feel. I frequently find myself trying to act like I’m happy or willing to do something even if I’m really not, I guess because I don’t want people to think I’m lazy or a jerk or something. 

But I definitely feel that “empty fake” stuff from acting in opposition with my actual thoughts and emotions. 

I wonder if you could expound on the concept of counterthinking a little. I think I may understand - I’m guessing what you mean is something like a mental conversation. Sort of persuading yourself to change your mind? But I’m not certain and would love for you to explain it a little. 

I’m pretty new to Reddit and hope I’m doing all this right. I’m having trouble finding the page rules, or whatever they’re called. Not really sure how to do much of anything here yet, but hoping I’ll figure it out soon. Seems like a good community to be a part of."
depression,ewpje4z,t3_cpbkgk,1565642453.0,"Everyone fails at things - it’s just part of how we learn what we’re good at and what we’re not so good at, and what works and what doesn’t. I know school tests have become a sort of ranking medium, and students are made to feel like they’re inferior if they perform poorly on tests... but really, if you perform poorly on a test, it just means you’re either not super knowledgeable about the subject the test was on, or you don’t handle tests well (or the test was poorly designed). That’s okay. You’re bound to suck at some things, but I’d bet you’re good at a lot of other things, so maybe try not to worry too much? I know that’s easier said than done, but still...

School presents students with a ridiculous amount of stress, and disappointed parents make it so much worse. Plus a lack of good friends makes you feel lonely. That’s not a nice place to be. I don’t have any very close friends outside my family, and sometimes that really sucks. But you shouldn’t let a lack of friends make you feel like you’re not valuable or not worth being loved. I’d bet you’re a really cool person, with all kinds of interesting ideas and opinions, likes and dislikes, skills, etc. I’d bet you’re going to do some really neat things in your lifetime. 

As a side note, if your dad is disappointed in you, that really just means he wants you to be something you’re not. It’s not your fault if he’s disappointed. I’ve learned that if someone is disappointed in you, it’s because of what they expect and how they feel - it’s unfair to blame yourself for just being you.

My mom has expressed a general disappointment in me for most of my life. It totally sucks. It’s the worst. It’s human nature to want to please your parents, and when they don’t allow you to do that, it makes you feel like absolute shit. But it’s good to remember that parents are just kids that grew up and had kids. They don’t always make the best choices, and they frequently hurt the people they care about without meaning to. I’m guessing your dad is making your life completely miserable and not even really realizing it. 

Sorry you’re in such a rough place. Things can and probably will get a lot better though, if you just hang on and keep pushing through. It’ll be a bit less horrible if you can get to a place where you’re okay with yourself. Even if your dad is still disappointed, if you’re doing your best and staying true to who you are, and you know that, I think you’ll feel a lot better. 

Have you ever tried keeping a journal? Self-reflection can really help you work through your struggles; especially if you don’t have a good friend to talk to, or if your good friend (in this case, your mom) isn’t available to talk. In some situations, I think journaling can be even more helpful than talking to others, because with journaling, it’s just you, and you can really figure out what you think or how you feel about something. Of course, sometimes it’s more helpful to hear what someone else thinks about something - especially if you’re at a bit of a dead end and really don’t know what to make of something. 

Best of luck to you, and feel free to message me directly if you ever want to. I don’t really know how Reddit works yet, but I’m figuring it out. Lol"
depression,ewpec3u,t3_cpfxl8,1565639364.0,"I think maybe it isn’t talked about much because most of the people we would call toxic don’t tend to realize the harm they’re doing (or they don’t care enough to try to change anything).

If you’ve noticed that you tend to behave in ways that cause others to suffer, and you’re attempting to essentially rewire yourself so that you don’t hurt people so much... in my book, that makes you a good person at your core. Maybe you didn’t draw the best deck of cards, but you’re still trying to make something good out of what you have. That’s honorable. 

I know what it’s like to hurt someone, intentionally or unintentionally, and feel like shit afterwards. I know the regret, I know the shame. I know how easy it is to think very poorly of yourself, maybe even think you’re somehow subpar or unworthy of being part of humanity; somehow just “not good enough.”

That said, I think most (or maybe all) “normal” people are at least a little bit toxic sometimes. One thing I’ve learned fairly recently is that it’s good to avoid thinking of things in such black and white type terms. There aren’t just toxic people and good people, or patient people and impatient people, or kind people and uncaring people. Most of us lash out sometimes, hurt people sometimes. We’re complex beings with complex emotions governing our actions - depending on how you’re wired and what you’ve experienced, you’ll respond differently in different situations. You can’t help being where you are now, but I believe that, depending on how the dominoes fall, you can eventually get from where you are now to a much better place. Maybe a place where you can feel okay about yourself and what you’re doing with your life. A place where you know you’re doing some good, and where you can be proud of what you’re doing, and not feel the pang of regret so often. 

I hope I’m right, because I’m also hoping to reach such a place. My method is to try to honor the Golden Rule. If I can figure out how I would like to be treated in a specific situation, I know how I should treat another person. Sometimes it’s tricky and takes a lot of thinking, and sometimes even if you know what you should do, your emotions get in the way. But as long as you can accept your failures and keep striving, you should keep making progress. 

Idk if this helps at all. Idk if this is what you were looking for. But I felt like posting a response ‘cause I had some thoughts, so there it is, and I hope it helps a little. 

I’m new to Reddit btw - hi everyone."
