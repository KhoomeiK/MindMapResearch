It would be hard to find the answer for why you feel more when you are sick though so I'll help with that one. When you are sick, some neurotransmitters stop being used as much and others are used more. So like when you get the flu, there is more of one neurotransmitter bouncing around in those synesthesia connections making everything more vivid. I assume that neurotransmitter is dopamine, but its more likely a combination of changes. Like even the distances between a neuron's sheathes can shrink or elongate, making things feel and look different. There's a lot of science behind what you feel. Study neurology and you'll understand more."
Psychosis,f0kb52i,t3_d554w1,1568674996.0,"Yeah, so, I read most of this story, but skimmed over others. So LSD literally melts your memories and senses together and destroys the make up of a lot of neurons. Most of the anxiety you feel is from damaged memories/neurons/relays/whatever. When this damage happens, you can think of your memories feeling closer together than normal and this increases your ""intelligence."" In the case of LSD, though, it activates these memories very randomly based on what you are experiencing or even just thinking about since your brain is so incredibly over stimulated with neurotransmitters. When that happens, only those memories/senses become close. You can also think of that as paranoia. That's why you are dealing with those ""i think its true, but I just, idk"" kind of thoughts. They feel real because you had a lot of neurotransmitters go through that one memory and it reinforced that one memory too much.

Don't every do psychedelics again. It sounds like you have very sensitive neurology. Don't do any kind of drugs, including alcohol, for a few years and your memories will even themselves out enough to start feeling fine. Its very important to continue with your therapist because he/she will also help even out your memories.

Btw, there is no higher spiritual existence of yourself, its just your memories and whatever makes up your body. It dies, you shit yourself, and then everything will decay into dirt. Studying anything religious will lead to delusions and is just a plain waste of time."
