I thrived off my friends and colleagues, I put on a show, and it was a good one that serves me really well. After 29 years doing that, I got tired, I couldn’t do it anymore. I live far from my closest friends and a year ago I started a job where there’s no comradery or culture - before this I was on an amazing team with amazing people - and I’m dying here, I have nothing to fake and now I’m sinking. I’ve realized it’s not the situation, it’s me, and I’m trying to find myself. I have 3 kids and that’s what keeps me here. I’m about to start a DBT program. I hope we all can find ourselves and something to hold on to. I’ve decided to try."
