NanatsunoTaizai,fq90cww,t1_fq8x1o1,1589181141.0,Assault mode is still stronger than ban though. Meliodas base power as of now is probably double than the assault modes. And assault mode is very strong. I don't know how to blank it out for spoilers so I can't say all that I want for anime only sakes.
wholesomeanimemes,fq6rky7,t3_gh0gqi,1589136920.0,"Bro, my friends grandma and mom said I was always welcome over at their house. They said I was like family because I was his first friend.

HPfanfiction,fnwzv3r,t1_fnwylba,1587328723.0,"He was influenced slightly. That's why I said included other options. But Tom's goal was to be the greatest dark lord after he heard of Grindelwald so he knew that it could be done. If there was no modern day dark lord he might have done things different.

OopsDidntMeanTo,fnvgv6h,t3_g3xqfx,1587292827.0,Why does it say virgin at the top left corner. Cause he doesn't look like a virgin....
HPfanfiction,fnveeap,t3_g430fu,1587290166.0,That sounds interesting. But there are some flaws to having this. Why would Harry be raised by them if his parents didn't die. What if he wasn't the chosen one because Tom riddle wouldn't follow exactly in Grindelwald footsteps. Dumbledore probably wouldnt be headmaster since he would settle down with Grindelwald. He probably wouldn't give Snape a second chance because Grindelwald wouldn't trust him. Many things
