As far as lamictal goes, I‚Äôve actually been able to start losing weight because it‚Äôs lifted me out of dark depression. No hair loss at all. Maybe 2 pimples a month. Memory loss on the other hand... it‚Äôs really hard for me to keep a thought in my head and it‚Äôs a little frustrating at times, but it‚Äôs nothing too dramatic and nothing that won‚Äôt go away if you stop taking lamictal. 

I didn‚Äôt want to take meds for years until I accepted that therapy alone just wasn‚Äôt working enough, and lamictal has definitely helped. I would give it a try for 2-3 months to see if it really helps you."
