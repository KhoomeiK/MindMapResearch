Taxidermy,fqbj58c,t1_fqbi2t0,1589237954.0,Btw it's always a good idea to disinfect your specimens as they could always carry bugs that like to feast on our prized collections ^^ it's rare but better safe than sorry hahah
Taxidermy,fqbiz7c,t1_fqbi2t0,1589237863.0,"That's great! Sadly the one in the gel wasn't perfect for just leaving it be as it started rottingi believe, I posted about it quite a while ago it was covered in white bugs which I think were mites but it didn't look right at all so I had to freeze it to kill them and disinfect it to get the white bugs off  in order to keep it :))"
Taxidermy,fqbif4e,t1_fqbh628,1589237569.0,"Bare in mind that these are my first ever attempts and all I did was look up a couple pages online and kind of just winged it haha, I'm no expert so hope you  can figure most of it out yourself :))"
Taxidermy,fqbia2h,t1_fqbh628,1589237494.0,"So for the hand sanitizer gel jar, you want to get the bug and either put it in isopropyl alcohol for a day or in the freezer for a couple days, that's if you don't want to pin it (ill explain how I pin them later). Make sure they're dried out and then put in a pot of hand sanitiser gel for a day so the bug soaks it up, when you think the bug is saturated with the gel it's ready for the jar. Put some hand sanitiser gel half way into the jar and then put your bee in the jar, fill the rest of the jar to cover the bee, wait a bit, you might notice some air bubbles coming out of the bee, this sometimes happens, for that I use a pippete or a syringe to suck the air bubbles out so it's all clear and finish off with filling the gel to the very top and screw the lid on shut, also forgot to mention you can use a needle or similar to position the bee in the gel how you want it to float, this might create more air bubbles that u might need to suck out. For pinning it's not as easy, you want to make sure the bee is still fresh, then dunk it in a pot of isopropyl alcohol to kind of clean it or disinfect it, it also makes it more maluable, after a day I then take it out and put it on a tissue so it's not dripping wet, you then need pins and Styrofoam to pin it, I don't know how to explain the last part of this, it's best to watch a YouTube video on how to pin bees, there's plenty of guides on YouTube. I got my pins from aliexpress. Hope this helps! Also for butterflies it's a different process you can't simply dunk them in alcohol or freeze them I suggest if you want to preserve butterflies you might want to do your own research as it's a bit too advanced for me yet hahaha."

Surprisingly wikihow didn't Dissapointed me in this context. Use soil from your garden or coconut coir bricks that you can easily get of amazon, they eat a variety of things that you can also Google and note down in your brain. I tend to find snails in wet dark places most common after rain under leaves or plants. I actually found my current snails under a carpet that's been left outside my garden, there was a bunch of them I guess they liked the damp dark nature of it. One important thing is to provide calcium to your pets aswell you can order cuttlefish bone off amazon or if you can't just grind up some dried out eggshells into a powder and sprinkle on their food.

PiercingAdvice,fo045dv,t1_fo02jzu,1587405757.0,"It most likely  isn't infected but I can't tell without having a proper look. I just use sea salt and boiling water, mix a pinch of sea salt and a cup of boiled water and wait till it cools to warm, then I'll soak my piercings in the cup for a good 10 mins or till the water cools completely. I also poured hot water on cloth to create warm compresses to hold on the piercings, keep cleaning it very carefully and make sure u don't turn or bump the piercing in any way, you want to be super gentle, then I rinse it with warm water and dry with a towel as well as I can without irritating it but making sure it's dry. Now I'm not sure how you can do that with an ear as I did it with my two nose piercings and just put my nose in the cup lol but I guess you could think of something hahah. I'm guessing you didn't dry it properly after a shower or your hair pulled on it in your sleep so you got it it will go away if you leave it alone and clean it gently trust me ;) in a case of infection though just stick to the same routine as it does happen sometimes and you just need to clean and wait.
