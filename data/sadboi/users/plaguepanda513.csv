BipolarReddit,fj2pi0q,t3_faxptx,1582949959.0,Needed this today. Got out of inpatient last Friday after not taking my meds post trauma. They boosted my lithium and I feel so much like myself again
BipolarReddit,fhf8kwa,t3_f2uc06,1581538407.0,5 times in the last 8 years since I turned 12. Iâ€™m normally able to hold out for a year and only get hospitalized every two but itâ€™s been really rough so far this year

bipolar,ffjb1mm,t1_ffj5o91,1579994546.0,Thankfully mine donâ€™t start that quick but they started today while I was at work. Not fun
bipolar,ffiyfxn,t3_ett0gh,1579985802.0,"Thank you for sharing this. I was diagnosed at 14, and seeing that it is possible to be successful and be creative with this illness gives me hope. Iâ€™m only 21 and still just trying to graduate uni but seeing that it is possible and can be done gives me hope."
unt,fdbszht,t1_fdb8kur,1578261596.0,"I donâ€™t think they have acro yoga specifically, but aerial yoga is a blast and I think is on Thursdayâ€™s if Iâ€™m remembering the schedule right! ðŸ˜Š"
unt,fdb5sqp,t3_ekh64y,1578254101.0,You should check out Twisted Bodies on Elm!! They offer aerial yoga as well as aerial acrobatics classes
unt,fb2e4jz,t3_eb5l1w,1576449394.0,"Iâ€™m sorry to hear that :( 

Coyote drive in in Fort Worth is a lot of fun if you like drive in movies. All the dr.pepper stars centers (indoor skating so good ice) in the area have public skate nights and if the prices are the same should only be $7 including skate rentals. 

Something I did to help me cope with the loneliness after moving here is I got involved at Twisted Bodies. Itâ€™s a great way for me to get out of the apartment and the classes are fun and all the instructors rock. And definitely check out the cities website because they are always posting about stuff going on around town! 

Something else Iâ€™ve tried doing to help is just taking myself out to do stuff. Go catch a movie or go hiking at one of the state parks nearby, check out a book from a library and people watch and read a book at one of the cafes downtown. 

Being lonely sucks, I get that so much. And even tho sometimes it feels like it will never get better, it does."
unt,fb2c5ub,t3_eb5l1w,1576448397.0,"If you have transportation there is a lot of great fun stuff to do in Fort Worth and Dallas! The museum districts in both cities are lovely and actually can be fun if you end up going alone. My worst fear is loneliness and I understand how lonely it can get with everybody gone. You can also check the city of Denton website to see whatâ€™s going on around town. And Twisted Bodies on Elm has free community yoga on Sundays. 

If you need help figuring out things to do in the area dm me! Iâ€™m from Fort Worth and know some great spots that can be fun with friends or alone"
BipolarReddit,fap7lgn,t1_fa9araa,1576281895.0,"Sorry I suck at responding to people. Iâ€™m not doing to hot and still struggling with the self harm. I just feel so alone. Which is dumb because all my friends say they support me and want me to reach out to them, but I feel like if I tell them anything Iâ€™m attention seeking. And all the drama with my relationships and this guy adds a whole other layer to all this. My self harm has gotten kind of bad, and he knows about it and tells me to call him but I feel like if I do he will leave. My sort of ex doesnâ€™t know about the pills or the cutting and for two weeks Iâ€™ve been so sure about breaking up with him and now Iâ€™m afraid of the future. The semester is over so I get a small brain break and I get a raise at work, on the outside it looks like everything is going my way, but on the inside I wish I could take someone I trust and go away and adventure and get away from everything"
BipolarReddit,f9pby5e,t1_f9pbp10,1575528907.0,"Thank you for sticking around, I appreciate it"
BipolarReddit,f9pbj8r,t1_f9pa7m1,1575528436.0,Youâ€™re right... Iâ€™m calling my doctor in the morning. I took a long shower and ate and am finally starting to calm down and think clearly. And the lethargic feeling is gone and Iâ€™m feeling normal.
BipolarReddit,f9p9wly,t1_f9p83up,1575526621.0,It would be the second time this semester. And my parents would make me move home. I could possibly lose my job because of missing work again. Iâ€™m an art major and if I miss the final critique Tomorow I will probably have to retake the classes. Mainly I donâ€™t want to move home because Iâ€™ve finally started making friends. I also feel like Iâ€™m just disappointing everybody being in again.
BipolarReddit,f9p0n5v,t3_e6992o,1575518365.0,I took the propranolol 4 hours ago. I calmed down and now Iâ€™m just lethargic
BipolarReddit,f67uyqt,t3_dqnro9,1572723055.0,"Caffeine is my best friend. Also give it a week at least, sometimes when you start it or up the dose the first couple days are a little rough fatigue wise, at least for me that is."
BipolarReddit,f5wu6l9,t3_dpmsai,1572530623.0,"If you are in university I highly recommend reaching out to your dean of students. I was just hospitalized for 8 days and I reached out to my dean and they are working with my instructors to excuse my absences. Also they might have more resources that are useful. I completely understand where you are at, and I completely recommend prioritizing your health. You wouldnâ€™t tell a diabetic or a person with a heart condition to not go to the hospital if they are in crisis, so a mental illness is just as valid. Itâ€™s the pot calling the kettle black here because I struggle with this as well, but allow yourself to ask for help. You donâ€™t have to go through all this alone."
unt,f0k00ft,t3_d32unq,1568667005.0,Art building has some great spots overlooking the courtyard! You can also check out the 4th floor and see the tape murals that Drawing 2 students are working in right now
unt,ezxe61r,t1_ezg0akv,1568238261.0,This omg. Tuesday and Thursday Iâ€™m in the art building from 10-8 so having a food option at all in that building would be so nice. I also was under the impression it was going to be finished by now :/
AskReddit,ezvemkd,t1_ezve1yg,1568175366.0,Thank you
AskReddit,ezvem54,t1_ezvdsjl,1568175356.0,I like to draw and paint. I like to think I have a good imagination but itâ€™s hard to start from nothing which is why I want to go in to concept art because you are given a brief kind of like a design brief and then you can build of of it. Itâ€™s so frustrating tho because I feel like Iâ€™m not going to be able to get a job when I graduate
AskReddit,ezvdmdh,t3_d2anfy,1568174410.0,"I feel safe commenting here because it will be drowned out. I hurt myself again today, first relapse in a long time, I think Iâ€™m manic or something (diagnosed bipolar 1) I donâ€™t want to sleep, often the only time I do is with meds and weed and Iâ€™m not eating. Iâ€™m confused and scared and alone in a new city. I made a friend but she isnâ€™t responding and Iâ€™m trying to keep myself from freaking out and over reacting but I really feel like she hates me and thatâ€™s why she isnâ€™t responding to my texts. I feel like I will never succeed and I will never become a better artist. I donâ€™t want to tell anybody this because they will tell my boyfriend or my parents and make me go to the hospital and if that happens I will have to drop out and quit my job and I donâ€™t want to do that. I just feel so awfully alone and I donâ€™t feel  like itâ€™s ever going to get better.  

If you read this far thank you..."

PropertyManagement,exa16uh,t3_cl6i7i,1566097404.0,"Hereâ€™s a fun one. Our maintenance tech didnâ€™t get the promotion to maintenance supervisor before turn started. We go through turn and it seems like everything is going smooth, almost too smooth,  until the literal night before move in day. Come move in day, we find out that so much was missed because of the negligence of the tech and parents are PISSSED. Morning of move in day our housekeeper turns in her keys by putting them on the gmâ€™s desk. Later that day our maintenance tech (yes same person) drops off his shirts, leaves his keys on the gms desk, doesnâ€™t tell anybody and leaves. So now we have 1 maintenance person for a medium sized 405 bed property, no housekeeping, a 5 person office staff, and a TON of pissed off parents."
