(I grew up in the middle of nowhere in the southwest.) But there were rules that my dad enforced very strictly with us. He taught us respect for the guns that we used and trigger discipline. The guns were always hidden from us and locked away when there was no adult present. This was how almost everyone I grew up with was raised. I don't own a gun right now, but that's because I move around a lot and different states have different laws that I don't want to navigate. However, I like to go to the range and shoot if the chance presents itself."

An outflow valve on the fuselage under the floor boards continuously regulates the cabin pressure from this continuous flow of air by opening and closing which also ensures that the air is not recirculated. The reason a lot of people get sinus issues after flying is because the air is dry.
