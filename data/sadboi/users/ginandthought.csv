tarot,fof8ay1,t3_g72s2u,1587729342.0,"I would not say I have ever cried but I do often get just the reading I need at the right time and it feels heavily spiritual. This is actually the whole reason I read for myself, when I get these perfect readings they really help me feel better about my life and give me faith in a life purpose or plan. They can be very impactful, especially when I am having a hard time."
relationships,foahqaw,t1_foacz4a,1587646720.0,"Thanks for the feedback, one additional thing I should mention is I do not live with my parents so getting us all together to talk would be hard, but I will think about this more because I would feel better talking to her with my mothers input, and this helped me realize that."
relationships,fo9ufgr,t3_fuspl5,1587631555.0,"I(25nb) am the youngest child in my family and my older sister(32f) who lives with my parents(in their early 70'sm/f) will not stop seeing a guy she just started dating at the start of this pandemic. She is an essential worker but thankfully does not have to directly interact with the public. Her new date (I do not know his age) apparently works in a pretty large store which is essential and has not had to close. He has told her it has been pretty busy. She did use to stay over at his place and now has just been spending the evening hours every few Fridays with him so that is an improvement but I still feel like these actions put everyone at risk but especially our aging parents. 


  My mother has tried to talk to her about it but she feels bad for her since she is still working, and also is very stressfull when she gives you advice sometimes. I can understand why my sister would have trouble listening to my mom. 


   My sister is a very outgoing person and I think feels very unhappy not being able to go out and enjoy herself, she loved shopping, eating out, and going out a lot more then I did before all of this happened. I do not always approve of her choices but I have never had to pass judgement on her until now because I have never felt like it was my job as the younger sibling. 


     Any advice on how I should speak to her about this? We have a good relationship but do not often speak about serious things. I don't know how to act in this sort of conversation with her. Also, am I taking this too seriously?"

AstralProjection,fo3ae1k,t1_fo376ar,1587483485.0,"Not as far as I could tell, it was just a little bit creepy to have an entity right there and jarring but I didn't sense anything negative coming off of him, his presentation its self was just creepy"
Anxiety,fm0iznx,t3_fsbigx,1585659069.0,"The only think I can think to say in terms of this is that it will get better. As you grow and mature away from who you were it will be less painful to remember. Additionally I think you should know almost everyone feels this. Everyone gets embarrassed at some point of their younger self. Try to focus on who you are now or who you want to be and eventually with time you will know you are not that person anymore. However, I also would probably not suggest trying to separate yourself so much from your past. Try understanding that you were learning and that's ok, give your younger self a break. Everyone makes mistakes and does things they regret at some point, that's how you get to where you are now

Edit: I will also say I have personally felt with this, I would say my most exbarrising experiences were in middle school and highschool with a few sprinkled in during college. Now as a 25 year old I can say it has gotten better. I did use to feel really badly especially about middle school me, but now I know I was just a kid who was still learning about life. Those mistakes I made have helped shape me and have informed me about who I do want to be. I think eventually you will feel the same"
Anxiety,fm0ht5z,t3_fsbsov,1585658144.0,"Anything that you watched as a kid will probably help bring up some good feelings. For me I'm rewatching all of Gilmore girls, I watched it as a kid and it's also a pretty positive show with a pretty idealistic world. Psych is also an awesome and funny show and super easy to watch/ rewatch. Last more modern one I would suggest is The Good Place."
Anxiety,fksnv3h,t3_fkayil,1584494328.0,"I am having this exact same fear. I was sick about 3 weeks ago with a bad cough and soar throat. I'm feeling better now mostly and I don't think it was covid19, but I still have some residual throat swelling and mucus which is making me scared about pumonia"
tarot,fkm9trk,t3_finist,1584324024.0,I have been doing a few readings in terms of this due to my anxiety being pretty bad this last week. I do try to center myself before my readings and clear my mind. I have to say despite my personal stress I have been generally getting hopeful readings. In terms of the world I consistently get readings which indicate important change and growth. This makes me hopeful. I'm going to try to stop my readings in terms soft this atleast for a while.
tarot,fker62i,t3_ffbqh5,1584118967.0,"I've been getting extremely positive cards in readings related to  covid19, anyone else? It's been happening both in readings about personal effects on my life as well as global impact. I'm pretty anxious so it's been on my mind a lot."
submechanophobia,fijt468,t3_f51h72,1582463086.0,"I grew up going to a lake in Vermont for vacation. The house we rented had a raft weighed down by an anchor, just the idea of the anchor made me not want to go near the raft. They also used the lake water for showers and the tube used to collect the water was held down by these large metal bars. I remember the first time I saw them I freaked out and swam as fast as I could away and out of the lake. One more memory is going on a boat around lake george and seeing some underwater boat tracks or maybe railroad tracks. This also scared me and skeeved me out. Now if I go back I can swim no problem and don't mind small underwater structures but I'm pretty sure I would vomit if I was ever close to anything like a ship! Lol"
