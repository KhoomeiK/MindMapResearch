medical_advice,fmblvfl,t1_fm9gwvn,1585928913.0,"I’ve been experiencing the same thing for the past few days now, it feels weird like cold or hot it makes me fear of a heart attack or stroke, and I’ve already had all the tests done ekg echo blood and I’m 19, I do have anxiety tho maybe that plays a part in it ?, just so uncomfortable tbh"
HealthAnxiety,fm9xm97,t3_ftvtm6,1585878875.0,"I’m 19 too and I fear I’m going to have a heart attack as well, I’ve already had multiple tests like EKG, Heart Ultrasound, and bloodwork, but I’m still fixated on the idea that something is wrong with my heart, it doesn’t help that I get chest discomfort like pains and stings or that my left arm feels weird like it doesn’t hurt but it feels cold or just weird not numb it’s hard to explain, but I know how hard it is to get over it, the thought always stays with me too, I had done a good job to ignore it but with recent world events it seems to have begun to flare up again along with other fears of mine"
ksi,fm7eke4,t1_fm7dnu3,1585824044.0,"I live in LA and a lot of people don’t have a problem with it because alot of the times we grow up in the same place and become close with eachother (Hispanics and African Americans) but some Choose not to use it because they feel it’s offensive towards African Americans and others don’t care because they feel like they are the same, obviously some people get bothered by it but it’s mostly not an issue over here or at least not where I’m from."
HealthAnxiety,fm5ef3f,t1_fm5de3n,1585771386.0,"Overthinking it and googling myself into holes doesn’t help either, I’ve had an EKG, heart ultrasound, and bloodwork done and I’m 19 years old so I know my heart is not the problem but having weird feelings like that cold stuff or weird chest tightness causes me to freak out and google the symptoms and it obviously tells me it’s my heart and I end up scaring myself even more, anxiety is a bitch, even like a few minutes ago I had a sip of expired juice and now I think I’m gonna die or something (lol) but yeah try to stay off google it can really fuck you up, I know how hard it can be though I struggle with that myself"
