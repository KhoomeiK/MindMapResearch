LivingAlone,foxjm26,t3_g9y70z,1588146049.0,"Well, that depends. Why are you shaking when you talk to them? If you're trying to recover from something, chances are you might not handle the challenges of living alone for the first year. Perhaps you will react stressfully, and it might actually hold you back from healing. 

If it is the first time you experience living alone, I would suggest that you do it when you feel you are at a stable place, spiritually and emotionally, and can afford to make effort and be out of your comfort zone. It sounds a lot like you just want to be away from people and isolate further, rather than experience the world as an autonomous individual.

Also, I would seriously recommend that you follow-up with your therapist. He/She might give you great insight into your patterns and stress triggers. Good luck with your healing journey! x"

Meditation,fosjjtk,t3_g950bt,1588031957.0,"I've honestly been meditating for years and I believe the true path is not to happiness, but rather to reach an awareness of self that secedes concepts like happiness. I'm actually going to loosely quote r/MidnightGospel_ on this: only by having an awareness of your awareness can you truly become the awareness. Trippy, right?

Seriously though, the instances where I got peace from meditation were not linked to a feeling, but rather to an understanding of my own patterns of thinking and feeling. That truth left me feeling heavier and lighter, at the same time, and gave me a lot of opportunities to examine my perspective on things across the board. 

By incorporating the practice of mindfulness in my daily life, as well as in the small breaks for a bit of grounding and balance, I managed to bring myself back to the present and live in the now - briefly, then a little longer. 

Once you approach meditation with that kind of angle, you realize that it is not only a practice of clarity, it is also about training your mind to focus. I hope I can reach that one day, but I guess it takes a lot of practice and years of experience."

Rory would start off with this crazy food and supplies list and feel incredibly happy and prepared for this for days on end and then have it all break down over something silly, like not finding her favorite book and running out of her favorite cereal, foreshadowing a mysterious unfolding of unfortunate events that will affect her life, and her little town of Stars Hollow, forever."
