AskReddit,foz94n8,t3_gaarw1,1588186747.0,"The Exorcist. Rated highly for a horror movie. It was awful. Sure, it had incredible special effects ahead of the time it was made, but I was bored up until the guy yelled “Take me instead!” And yeeted himself out of the window and onto a flight of concrete stairs below. That was the last few minutes of the movie. I don’t get it.

Edit: rated 83% on rotten tomatoes

Also managed to destroy a household item people were fond of because they believed they could use it to contact dead relatives. Additionally ruined the excuse guys had to touch their girlfriend’s hand on a date. Now everybody has a stigma around a piece of wood with print on it and some plastic because of a story that was “reportedly true”"

memes,fnudf6t,t1_fntnlr8,1587259644.0,"Look, I’m transgender. FtM 15. I know I’m a guy. I don’t give a shit how many people tell me my brain isn’t fully developed, I’m 100% happier now socially transitioned than I was a year ago. Stuff like this takes away medical treatment for people who really need it. Imagine suffering from something that’s so incredibly debilitating you can’t step out of your room or even take a shower for weeks on end because you feel like throwing up or cutting every time somebody mis-genders you. I have a friend who’s parents don’t support him medically transitioning. Deadname him and mis-gender him all the time. He’s been in and out of psychiatric hospitals for 2-3 years. No, parents who pressure their kids to go by non binary pronouns are not in the right. Yes, kids should have at least 6 months with somebody who isn’t a gender affirming therapist that goes through everything. But kids know who they are. Kids know what they need sometimes. In my case I’d much rather die than live the rest of my life as a female. It makes me sick because i’ve already spent 14 years of my life pretending to be somebody I wasn’t because of societal pressure. My point is, you haven’t experienced this first hand. Don’t make our situation worse please. I’ve already lost several friends because their parents didn’t agree with me wanting to be happy. My parents have been judged for letting me get treatment."

trans,ff1yhe6,t3_eqy481,1579489094.0,"Hey, I know, it’s terrifying. I’m 14, almost 15 FtM. Just came out to everybody in my family a few weeks ago, but I’ve felt this way for as long as I could remember. I want to make sure you aren’t confusing yourself too much, because sometimes people pick out personality traits that have nothing to do with gender, but still associate them to gender. Not to say you aren’t transgender, just pointing that out. Something that might help is identifying different feelings. It isn’t the same for everybody, but for example,
When I was around 5 up to 12 I would roleplay as a male character with friends for really no reason that I could explain at the time because it just felt right.
I went through a phase of “oh, girls do this and people say I’m a girl, so I should be doing those things too.” I never enjoyed any of it, in fact it made me resentful of everything because I wanted to fit in, but I couldn’t seem to. 
I was raised religious, but when I was 11 I started losing my faith in God, but I still prayed that I could just somehow have a boys body. 
There are a lot more feelings I could touch on, but if any of these somehow resonate with you then start by accepting them. The classic denial phase hurts and digs you down deeper into a hole you don’t want to be in. Once you accept who you are, find other people who will do the same and maybe even more people that can relate to you. Once you feel safe, reach out and teach the more hesitant people to be more accepting of you. As for experimenting, like other people have commented, try to get a short androgynous sort of haircut. Go clothes shopping with a friend some time and pick out whatever clothes you want. Lastly, be patient. This stuff takes time. It took my mom about a full year to get me into a therapist and stop thinking it was some sort of phase. One step at a time. Do what makes you happy, I wish you the best."
