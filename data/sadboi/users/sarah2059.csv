I was planning on getting into OLD this month. Was going to go out this weekend and do me basically.  Well, that changed once i hit the nail shop the other day. I wore skinny jeans that i folded up to my knee (THEY WERE NOT MADE FOR THAT.) After a massage and lotion, I tried to pull them down. Now, I have thor like CALF muscles and strength but for the life of me, i couldn't pull them down past that muscle. Well thanks to my lovely(newly) lotioned hands and legs i lost my grip. Wood met hand and tore my ligaments.  Now i can barely text and have to wear a cast for awhile. 
Universe said NOPE! Not today.
