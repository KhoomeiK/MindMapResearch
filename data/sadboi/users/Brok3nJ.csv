I have no plan whatsoever, and don't even have a need to even consider it... but the goddamn thought of dying is just there, kind of sitting and making itself known in the background.

nba,fiamgq8,t1_fiam2c7,1582304076.0,"I thought about that, too. Because the Bucks are extremely versatile with their ability to switch. If they don't use Lopez they'll most like run some combo of Giannis and Ersan Ilyasova"

nba,fiallnb,t1_fial1nk,1582303573.0,"Absolutely true 😂😂😂 the fact that he's played so well, and almost mistake free (I believe his turnover rate is substantially down during this run as well, compared to his season and career average) is incredible. I really do hope it propels my guys into the championship"
nba,fiald7v,t1_fiaj0k2,1582303434.0,"Well yeah, in that respect it's absolutely true. 

I don't want ppl to misunderstand my criticism of Westbrook, because I'll be the first to tell ppl, he is absolutely an elite player. His style of play, however, has gotten him more out of where he wants and needs to be than it has gotten him there. These last 2 months has been sensational, tho. And I truly hope he keeps it up. But his past play just gives me reservations"
nba,fiaij6h,t1_fiaho9i,1582301753.0,"That's my worry. I mean, they have an unproven Isaiah Hartenstein and a way over the hill Tyson Chandler, and the next tallest to them is 6'8 Robert Covington and Danuel House. Unless they manage to run the opposing team's bigs down faster than they can get tired, their endurance is going to be greatly tested"
nba,fiai7tr,t1_fiahhca,1582301568.0,"Truth. Lmao I he was very close to this form when he had Amare at center and Shawn Marion playing PF back in the prime Suns days. Literally the only thing that stopped them was Kobe and the Lakers. That team could have won a title, imo"
nba,fiai12z,t1_fiahm8b,1582301458.0,"It has been, if I remember right, although I may need to check that, again. But yeah, the last 2 months he has been an absolute monster next to Harden, not like in the beginning 2, where he just looked like an out of place all-star turned role player, at that point. I seriously have some real hope he keeps this up. Because they can be a matchup headache for a number of teams in the playoffs, including the Lakers"
nba,fiahfvx,t1_fiagweq,1582301106.0,"I agree. I've been a fan since I was a kid, and this iteration of them has some genuine potential, mainly because their makeup is so unique. I hope for a surprising and unexpected run, but I'm also a realist lol"
nba,fiahb57,t1_fiagql3,1582301028.0,"Also, his midrange game isn't surefire, either. Not to mention, it's a lost art in today's nba. Midrange just isn't the best shot to take anymore, and the west has plenty of good enough perimeter defenders on each team to bother him with tha, at well"
nba,fiah542,t1_fiagql3,1582300928.0,"You're right. On both counts. I'm well aware of his huge improvement since December. But at the same time... old habits die hard? Do you trust him to continue to play the way he is playing now when the playoffs come around? This isn't the first time he's done this kind of great playing leading to the playoffs, then when in t he playoffs, he falls back into the habits he was scrutinized for, in the first place. The last 3 or so yrs is evidence of that, alone. I can hope he doesn't repeat his mistakes and keep up how he's been playing since we've gone super small, but it's hard to trust the consistency"
nba,fiagmgh,t1_fiafwlh,1582300623.0,"Right? Everyone loves his ""passion"" but that shit is gonna cost him lol"

nba,fiag37m,t1_fiafdvu,1582300310.0,"I do agree with that. I've never been the biggest Westbrook fan, even if he does play with ""passion"". He's wildy inconsistent, and he has no range to make anybody pay for closing out the lanes on him. If he learns how to play with more control, instead of looking to do it all his way, I'd feel MUCH better about our chances. But as a realist, I can't see us getting out of the second round, tbh"

MortalKombat,fhtrnhj,t1_fhtojdc,1581877356.0,"True. I actually forgot about Sheeva, especially aince they already have a design for her in the story mode. So I'm assuming she's an absolute lock. It would be nice if it was a KP3, tho. That'd give the roster more variety, I think"
