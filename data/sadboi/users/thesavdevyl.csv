Advice,fkz5qaj,t1_fkyu16z,1584663374.0,"Ok, first off, he told me I wasn’t allowed to sleep with anyone else if I was sleeping with him, AND he explicitly told me that he wasn’t sleeping with her and that he didn’t sleep with anyone but me. So that’s just a given that I would be upset. 

Second, his ex and him were in a very abusive 3 year long relationship which ended in them beating the absolute fuck out of each other. They literally started hanging out again because she moved in across the street. We were just starting to date when they became friends again. The only reasons it mattered to me are that he slept around with someone else other than me is because 1. he explicitly told me he wouldn’t fuck anyone else and that I couldn’t either, and 2. got us both to lie to one another, and he lied to the both of us. She and I were FRIENDS. I made every effort to be a good friend to her and I felt like shit that I hadn’t told her about us sleeping together. He clearly said to me multiple times that he didn’t want her knowing. I suspected them having sex very early on but pushed away my suspicions because I was afraid of coming off as paranoid. Other than that I did NOT care about him sleeping around, I don’t have feelings for him and I don’t want to be with him. 

Third, we literally only tried to get her out of the room to because we were petrified he was going to hurt her or manipulate her again, and he did. I’m sorry if you find my intuition and care for her to be immature, but frankly I’ve been so rational and calm until I discovered how emotionally abusive he truly is."

Advice,fhp5i55,t1_fhp2a0v,1581782436.0,"Thank you. I honestly have been through so many situations like this with him, and it always comes down to him telling me I need to “shut up and listen,” but even when I do, he goes on tirades and nothing gets worked out. I didn’t go to his exes for confirmation of his actions, but I did end up telling that what’s been happening and they shared similar experiences. It was more of a coincidence than anything, but it did help me come to the realization that he’s manipulating me. 

This has been one of our more minor experiences, but I’m still concerned there’s no turning it around. He usually dominates when and where we communicate, and I feel as though I never get to lay my cards on the table. It’s not that he didn’t buy my story, he was upset that I drank and drove, period. I can understand why he’s upset, but he’s never going to want to discuss the situation. Every time something bad happens, he ignores me until he feels like he’s over it. We don’t ever get to work anything out. I also did leave him a note that said he was my best friend and that I didn’t mean to hurt him in the way I addressed him. He’s convinced I did, however."

It’s a good ice breaker and all of my coworkers that I’ve been friendly with have started talking to me because I’ve been upfront. I think it’s about confidence, which people with BPD usually lack due to our irrational fears, but I swear it’s the key to getting people to talk to you. You’d much rather want to communicate with someone who appears sure of themselves. I know this is the “fake it till you make it” trope but it really does work."

She just shuts up when he starts yelling. She told me that it’s just something that gets him to “calm down”, but really, it’s her way of letting the abuse slide.

CPTSD,fg6t9l4,t3_ex14dw,1580576355.0,"Not gaslighting, but definitely abusive. It perpetuates the idea that your feelings are invalid. As a victim of abuse and gaslighting, I can say that this mindset is not something to be ok with. Everyone’s traumas are valid."
BPD,fg6snne,t3_ex6rhk,1580575965.0,"I’m not saying this is definitely what it is, but I have CPTSD as well as BPD and this is a major symptom of trauma, a vengeful obsession with the abuser. The fixation on making them suffer is something your brain developed due to the mental damage they caused early on. Most people don’t even realize they were traumatized and that’s why this feeling is happening. I’m sorry you feel this way, but do know that suicide is never the answer. The best revenge is living your life to the fullest, no matter what they say or do to you. It shows them that you’re more than their words and ideas of you, and they will eventually realize how stupid they were to think that way about you."

He agrees that our parents did not treat us correctly, but I know that he probably perceives them a little better than I do. He of course still lives with them and is a minor so I don’t judge him for needing their assistance, but it might be harder for him to break away from their hold later on.

CPTSD,fg6pg61,t3_ex6pkg,1580573854.0,"I think about this all the time. Even when the abuse was active and the trauma was being formed, I knew that my parents were completely two faced. They’d be screaming at me or downplaying my feelings, and then someone else outside of the family would show up, and they’d immediately pretend like everything was ok. My dad even once went to the measure of coming up to me and asking if I’m ok and that I could “talk to him if I needed”, just to make it look like he wasn’t abusing me. It honestly fucked with my brain so hard. They always used to say “we fight and scream and argue, but once were calmed down, we remember that we love each other and everything is ok.” Like they didn’t realize that they tore my heart little by little and that it stuck with me. They tried to make me believe that that’s just how love is. It makes me cry ugly tears sometimes. I’m sorry that your family were great at covering up the truth, because it probably made you perceive love as something putrid."

CPTSD,fg0b1ak,t3_ew85yu,1580404025.0,"this is a major aspect of this disorder, discrediting yourself constantly. the “i didn’t have it as bad as others” mentality is one that plagued us into believing that we’re drama queens and that we should be ashamed for even being the slightest bit upset about our past. guilt is such a curse for us. i’ve literally always compared myself to my friends who were physically abused and discounted myself for have experienced “just” mental abuse. it’s even to the point where i believe that i deserved it, or that i’m a bad person for it. i’m sorry you feel this way too, because it really makes the self feel less and less worthy of love and support, and represents major self-abandonment problems."
CPTSD,fg0ajj9,t3_evyjfd,1580403725.0,"I do this so frequently it’s almost just how i’m always perceiving things. and what extra sucks is when the fear takes over completely and you finally say something to someone and they get upset with you, like needing reassurance is a burden. that just makes everything worse. I’ve practiced a lot of positive self talk, and even though I 9 times out of 10 don’t believe it, that one time makes me think more rationally. 

plus i started looking at people for what they are: people. when these emotions start popping up, i tell myself that others are just busy or have a lot of things on their mind, and that however they’re acting around me is not personal. once i started realizing that everyone has something going on, my fear that i’m annoying them or that they hate me secretly starts to disappear. i guess it’s the factor of “it’s out of my control” that makes it easier to deal with the fears."

relationship_advice,fek0m1c,t1_fejwhy5,1579190052.0,"well i mean honestly the last part is probably true. but i’m not trying to be intimate with him, he just told me he’d like to catch up at some point over a beer or coffee. and i really don’t understand why i have to not speak to him when my boyfriend is still very much in contact with his ex and her family."
relationship_advice,fejzvuh,t1_fejxxzy,1579189602.0,"the truth is that i always told myself that i would’ve much rather had been his friend the whole time, and i knew that if he reached out first, i would want to be friendly with him. i also didn’t respect him through out the relationship either, and we both agreed that we just needed to not date and that we’ve both grown from the experience. but frankly i don’t think i’m disrespecting our relationship, my boyfriend is currently still caught up in his ex’s life and her family issues, and i haven’t complained at all."
relationship_advice,fejzj0x,t1_fejwh4a,1579189380.0,"we really broke each other’s hearts. i always said that i’d be his friend if he reached out and wanted it. and the truth is we both had a lot of good times in our relationship, and he’s really not all bad of a person. just someone i don’t want to date again."
BPD,feef90h,t3_eome3i,1579032544.0,i get this with my boyfriend constantly. i try my best to push away the negative feelings but i find myself splitting on him. i wish it was just easy to say “go have fun!” without wanting the complete opposite.
sex,fe6kzd4,t1_fe6kq8y,1578894376.0,"thank you!! i’m sure the car is probably the best place to start. and i knew about the sex offender possibility, but i’m planning on being as far away from children as possible."
sex,fe6kl68,t1_fe6kbib,1578893982.0,"well it wasn’t really about validation, more so about tips and advise for how to go about it, but thanks anyway! i’m glad you think you know everything about my relationship based on my reddit posts, those definitely tell you every single detail. i’m wondering why you’re judging me, i get the moral aspect of it for you, but people’s desires vary."
sex,fe6jzv7,t1_fe6joh6,1578893397.0,"have you ever heard of a thrill? i don’t really WANT anyone to catch me, i’d much rather it not happen. also, where does the non-consent come from? we’re both consenting and as long as we’re not actually caught, no one else is affected. you kind of seem like someone who judges other people’s sexual fantasies and that’s not really something this community stands for."
sex,fe6jheu,t1_fe6iw1j,1578892900.0,"i find this comment to be highly rude and unhelpful. i’m not getting off to the idea of getting caught, THATS what makes me nervous. also, maaaaany people have sex in public. so you’re saying a large group of people are mentally fucked. i’m also sure that the other members of this community would find your comment offensive and simple minded."
BPD,fdkvuo2,t3_eluild,1578512219.0,"i felt this way until i got with my current SO. he’s much more possessive of me than anyone has ever been, and it’s nice, but i can tell it eats him up inside when other guys hit on me. it’s a double edged sword for sure."
Makeup,fdczvv7,t3_ekki16,1578289383.0,"funny enough, this is how i feel about J* blue blood. it just doesn’t seem to work for me"
goth,fdbxbdy,t1_fdbtm3w,1578263396.0,"technically gothic rock, dark wave, etc."
goth,fdbsmp5,t3_ekhalq,1578261372.0,"definitely lean towards earlier stuff if you want the best basis for goth culture. siouxsie and the banshees, joy division, sisters of mercy, bauhaus, christian death, etc. you could also consider bands like the birthday massacre and cold cave which are more modern."
Cosmetology,fcxriur,t3_ej55l9,1578069445.0,"their color line should be free of them, or at least parabens."
Cosmetology,fcwhm0z,t3_eh2x97,1578025839.0,"the dyson is FANTASTIC. super nice technology, and a two year warranty."
Makeup,fcwgs8t,t3_ej8szf,1578025229.0,liquid all the fucking WAAAY
