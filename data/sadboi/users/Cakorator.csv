The real star of the show here is the aquafaba royal icing, which I was EXTREMELY nervous about. But it works perfectly and doesn‚Äôt taste at all like bean.

Basic Recipe is:

1/4 c Aquafaba (Liquid drained from a can of chickpeas) 1 tsp white vinegar

whisk until just combined and frothy

~1.5 to 2 lbs of sifted Powdered Sugar

Flavoring My favourite combo is: 
1 tsp. Vanilla Extract 
1 tsp. Butter Flavour 
1 tsp. Almond Extract

For flood consistency, whisk until just barely white and thin with small amounts of water and/or tiny amounts of leftover Aquafaba while checking for memory (You want any strings you pull to disappear back to flat and smooth in a couple of seconds)

For piping consistency: whisk 5-8 minutes or until you‚Äôve reached stiff peaks (threads you pull *don‚Äôt* disappear even after several seconds)

Many recipes suggested adding some white food coloring, but I found it unnecessary."

I like infusions because unlike a hot sauce or eating the pepper, you WILL feel all the burn but it‚Äôs a ‚Äúclean‚Äù burn that quickly dissipates in comparison. It doesn‚Äôt cling to your lips/tongue/inner ears until you physically scrape it off with a block of cheese the way foods do."
