BPD,fp1tfp6,t1_fp12h8y,1588247278.0,"Getting access to DBT can be extremely difficult for a lot of people. Mental healthcare is ridiculously underfunded in the UK for example. I've been begging for 3 years now to be taken seriously, and to be even put on a waiting list for DBT. Instead I'm told my issues are 'too complicated', and I have been kicked back to the bottom rung of the ladder system for mental health so many times. I haven't heard a peep from the service in months, I have no idea what's going on or whether or not they even accepted my referral at all.

If getting into therapy and being given these tools was free, easy to access, and done with minimal delay, I would absolutely agree with what you've said.

funny,fotxgb3,t1_fosthry,1588069591.0,You came up with that theory where exactly?
Coronavirus,fl4wh20,t1_fl4peou,1584823087.0,"The ones who disagreed were at risk of being ostracised by their community. I know, because that's how it's felt here. We live in a rural area, and people are very conservative. They were spouting 'it's just a flu' and went collectively nuts when schools were shut. I was there wanting to tell them this isn't some inconvenience the government cooked up. It's a very real threat to everyone. But we're new to the community, and if I were to speak out, I'd have been labelled as 'THAT woman' who is being 'irrational', 'antisocial' and 'fearmongering'. 

Even now people aren't getting it. They're still organizing meetups in parks, and passing things house to house. It's scary that they are so cavalier. If I say something though, when it all goes back to normal, are they going to realize I was right to be so concerned? Or will they close ranks, like people in small towns tend to do to outsiders who don't share their views?"
BPD,fkk3rqn,t1_fjt33uf,1584272296.0,"I accidentally stumbled into the sub lovedonesbpd or something similar. Top post was saying about how the OP's therapist said 'most' therapists won't even treat people with BPD because they can't handle it, and just imagine how toxic someone has to be that not even therapists will help them.

That's disgusting. One thing I noticed in there, is that they refer to people with BPD as 'BPDs'. Apparently we're not people, we're just our illness. No one cares what happened to someone with BPD to lead up to them having that mental illness, no, they're just toxic pieces of trash who don't deserve help.

Not only that, but any therapist who refuses to treat someone with BPD shouldn't have gone into mental health in the first place. They should have their licenses revoked if they cant act as a professional.

Oh and the sub said no 'BPDs' allowed, you're not allowed to post if you have BPD, and presumably if they find you lurking in there you will be banned. And no one is supposed to be anything but supportive, so it's just a fucking echo chamber in there, validating their own beliefs, whether their opinions are based in fact or not. Honestly, I'd be happy to avoid anyone who posts in there, as they certainly aren't people I'd want in my life."
