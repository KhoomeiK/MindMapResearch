SuicideWatch,fpanc3i,t3_gcb0sp,1588451719.0,"I'm sorry if this comes off a harsh but if you've been writing this book for years why didn't you do anything to try to get it published a long time ago? Like why didn't you look for an agent years ago? Also you don't know if your book would've been rejected since you never even tried to get it to a publisher. And even if it was J.K. Rowlings book was rejected 12 times before she got someone to publish it and look how well that turned out for her! And even if no one published this book I'm sure you have so many story ideas at least one of them would make it out there and be successful. It honestly just sounds like you don't really have fate in yourself and your work and that's why nothing's come of it. Like it sounds like you created this great story and did nothing with it cause your scared of the what if's.

And yes you probably wouldn't be making that much unless your first book is one of the few mega successes for new authors but still you gotta start somewhere and then work your way up. if you ever want to actually be an author there WILL be rejection, and there WILL be people who don't like your work even hate it but you gotta get over that or else your really not gonna be able to accomplish anything as an author. And if your story really is good the people who like it will outweigh the people who hate it.

If you truely want to be an author you need to get over this fear or rejection and the fear of criticism and hate of your works cause no matter how good it is that will happen and you have to be able to overcome it. This is coming from a 19 year old aspiring author so I totally get you."

My plans were to get a job save up for a year and move out but that hasn't happened and I can't take a year more of this.

I don't really do anything expensive besides buy books. That's like the one thing I'll spend money on. Even though my mother treats me like crap she doesn't make me pay any bills and buys the groceries. I don't do any activities or really spend a lot of money. And like I said we're poor and been that way for ten years so I'm used to living on a budget.
