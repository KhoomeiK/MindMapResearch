selflove,f7c94js,t3_dv0xdr,1573587136.0,"Hey, not more than a month ago I was in that place (although nothing that horrible happened to me). The first major fix in my life was finding the right medication to ease the constant depressive feelings. Once I had that, I was able to begin changing my thinking.

You're right that no one else understands. You have to realize that the only person who can help you is the same person who understands what's wrong: *you*.

I would recommend talking to a doctor to see what they think about medication, because it may be what you need to give you a boost of motivation. Beyond that, positive self-talk (""I am worthy of love"", ""I am enough"", etc.), meditation, exposure therapy, and exercise/good nutrition/good sleep will all help immensely.

I know that's a lot to do so take baby steps. You can do this, it's just gonna take hard work."

joker,f34407k,t1_f32z2rc,1570649863.0,"Trust, it's nowhere near as violent or controversial as people are saying. I've even read an article by someone saying they *won't* see it because of its controversy, which is a perfect illustration of the fact that people form their opinions from the media instead of themselves.

Simply put, it hit a very sensitive note regarding mental illness and the fact that people who commit violence are people just like everyone else. It's ironic, of course, that nobody is considering that message. It's as if the society of Gotham is a perfect reflection of our own society today."

movies,f2oor9g,t1_f2ong4m,1570331299.0,"I understand that perspective, but I guess it could be taken either way. I would prefer to interpret it as a literal story, or at the very least it was the real Joker locked up in a psych ward fabricating one of his many ""origin stories"" in his head.

It wasn't a perfect movie, but few are. I feel that it came very close. Some things didn't make sense initially... but when I think back on it in the context of the character, perhaps that was the intent. This movie was overall chaotic and confusing, the very ideals which the Joker stands for.

And beyond all of that, Joaquin Phoenix's performance is one the greatest I've seen. His laughing in this movie is haunting, chilling, terrifying, heart-breaking, and full of every emotion but happiness. In my opinion, he beats Heath Ledger. The laugh says it all."

Make sure you understand your role first. You can read tons on that anywhere, so I won't get into it. Bottom line is that a bassist must state the chord progression and how those chords relate to each other. That's the most basic task; from that, you can begin to explore other things like scales, improvisation, and even soloing. If you need to understand scales and the notes on the neck more, then that's what has to be done, as boring as it is. Don't become confined to the ""box"" shape (usually pentatonic scale). Theory is your best friend, because once you understand it, you can choose whether or not you want to follow or break the rules of it.

Good luck and keep practicing!"
