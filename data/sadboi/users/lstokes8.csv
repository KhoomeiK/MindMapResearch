SuicideWatch,fny5y0p,t3_g48v49,1587354213.0,"No, you certainly should not. Once this pandemic is over and you can return to school tell someone who you trust at school. I’m a teacher and if I knew what was happening to you I would do whatever I could to help you to become safe. Please wait and get help. You’re important and so loved."
Fitness,fnfqeov,t3_g15sjg,1586913297.0,I used a 45lb bag of dog food the other day - there are no rules anymore.
Anxiety,fn6ua1h,t3_fzm0k0,1586707478.0,"Yes, I feel so guilty if I’m watching tv or reading when I could be doing something more productive like cleaning or working. It’s terrible. My spouse loves to just relax and watch tv etc and I feel on edge the whole time."
SuicideWatch,fn6tqyu,t3_fz7iza,1586707177.0,"I’m angry for you. That is a huge injustice and I can’t believe more wasn’t done to support you and rectify it. I am truly so sorry that you have to endure this and now being stuck at home with your rapist... I cannot imagine. This will end and you will survive it and come out on top. You’ll find love with someone who understands your struggle and supports you unconditionally because you deserve that. Stay strong in this time and remember, it won’t last forever and how fucking beautiful it will be for you to succeed in life despite the trauma. you are strong because you’ve lived and survived every day since then.
All my best."
SuicideWatch,fn6t45d,t3_fzt253,1586706815.0,"Hey OP,
You will get through this. I promise you. I know at this moment it seems like there is nothing but I can assure you that there are people out there who love you and want to see you thrive. Even if it’s hard to imagine ever overcoming this feeling or whatever life situation you’re in - there is always a way up. Contact a therapist or the national suicide hotline ASAP."
