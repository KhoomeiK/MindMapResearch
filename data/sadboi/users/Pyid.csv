schizoaffective,fq0y712,t3_ggasx1,1589039103.0,I definitely do this. For some reason when I have a song stuck in my head I have to listen to it on repeat until I know every lyric or until the next song gets stuck. I feel anxious if I try to listen to anything else.
schizoaffective,fpt9jwy,t3_gfap0z,1588887251.0,I've been on Clozapine for 5 years. The side effects and blood monitoring are not great but stick to it and you will feel so much better. Clozapine saved my life!

MedicalGore,fnnri80,t3_fvqa2a,1587099620.0,I had the same surgery in 2017. It's neat to see what it's like in action. Thanks for posting!
schizophrenia,fgjomof,t3_eyq2kx,1580848327.0,I am the only one in my family with it. I went for genetic testing and they said my kids will have a 4% chance of developing the illness and a 15% chance of developing any mental illness. Was pretty cool to find that out.
schizophrenia,ffveklr,t3_evbwoe,1580262284.0,"I did CBT, DBT, and talk therapy. My psychologist is an expert on CBT for psychosis and has taught me great skills for challenging my paranoid thoughts and changing my behaviours to try to lessen anxiety. I use the skills daily and I don't have to take a bucket load of meds to cope anymore."

schizophrenia,f5z244s,t3_dpvz3j,1572565484.0,First stay was 3 months. Next was 2 months then 3-7 weeks for the next 5. Always takes me awhile to stabilize on meds or try new meds.
Psychiatry,f5961v5,t3_dn65nv,1572072543.0,I am a psychiatric nurse living with schizophrenia for the past 6 years. Getting through school (BSPN) was tough but I had a lot of help and determination. You can do it too!! I plan on getting my masters in 4 years once I have a bit more front line experience. Message me if you have any questions!
schizophrenia,f3suc9l,t3_dhzioa,1571109571.0,For me medications don't control all of my symptoms. I have done over 6 years of therapy including CBT and talk therapy. I went from homeless and completely out of touch with reality to working two part time jobs in a professional setting. I have my own home and hobbies. If your brother is willing I would highly recommend finding him a therapist or psychologist to complement his medication treatment. I found mine through my local mental health team. Wishing you both all the best!
schizoaffective,ewkgcuq,t3_copc7f,1565483668.0,I work as a psychiatric nurse in the addictions field. I first got sick just before my last semester of my bachelor's degree so I was (barely) able to finish. I'm restricted by my Dr. to 4 days per week and my employer knows of my condition and has to accommodate my needs. What about trying a warehousing or stocking job where you can earn a living wage but still avoid too much social interaction?
nursing,ertgg5g,t3_c3tp6s,1561241678.0,"What about working in mental health/Substance use? I have worked in community for the past 6 years and love it. I have lots of patient interactions but no gross stuff, just a lot of talking and case management. Other areas of community nursing might be a good fit for you too."
