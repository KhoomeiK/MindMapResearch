I was only half listening (it came up on my Jaymes Young station) and thought, ugh, another guy who wants to be Eminem...And then Intro III came on later, and THAT I listened to, and I just started *crying*...

I do the exact same thing with music as you described, to evoke emotion or a certain feel/mindset. And that's awesome about the lyrics thing... Honestly I'm the opposite. I think though that's the decade of violin I played. I usually hear instrumentals first, then hear the lyrics. I think NF caught my attention because he raps. 

And that organization is and AMAZING idea. Thank you so much for the idea! That's wonderful. And yes, you put into words exactly what I was doing. I was trying to muddle through why I was listening to music like this (like I said, it's just I'm going through a lot).
 
""I have other playlists that are specifically for bringing me down when I'm anxious or heavily dissociating or just in a place where I need care and not just the amplification of my thoughts and emotions in solidarity.""

I DO THIS TOO! Music grounds me so much. 

So yes, this was very helpful. Thanks for the thoughtful comment! Have a wonderful day.

CPTSD,fp8ptt1,t3_gc0p3n,1588399118.0,"I've noticed that people put emphasis on High School and College because life sucks. I'm not going to sugar coat it, either. You go to school, make friends (or don't), you're voted Most Likely To Become President in the yearbook (or don't), graduate and lose all your friends because they all go to different colleges. Then College--you join a frat house or something, and you party, and you collect all these crazy stories...Then you graduate. And you're stuck in your parents basement, or you get a job...and you fart around Life until you find The One, and settle down...

And before you know it you're forty at your HS reunion, you have two kids and a wife that hates you, your marriage is teetering on divorce and are up to your eyeballs in debt...But you're sitting there reminiscing about the ""good old days"". Why?

Because being an adult sucks. There's nothing good about HS and there's nothing good about College. Everyone hypes you up to cover up the fact you're just another body to be churned out in Life. Because that's really all HS and College is. They try to make it sparkle and shine and seem *really exciting* to mask the fact it's just a processing plant that spits you out in an unfair world where you're not fucking special, you never will be, and all those frat parties and Most Likely To Be mean fucking nothing. Especially in today's work force, that special college diploma is worth little more than toilet paper that everyone is in dire need of right now.

Bitter? Maybe. I just like to think of myself as a realist. Do yourself a favor and don't feed into their bullshit and become disappointed that College wasn't all it's cracked up to be.

You got this. It's your life, do with it what you want... not what everyone tells you it should have been.

Edit: I meant for this to make you feel better, not worse, so I'm sorry if it had the opposite effect. It's late (early?!) where I'm at...But yeah, same--look at stories on my profile. I think school is a joke all around. Well, minus the academics obviously..."

They already ordered everyone a laptop by that point ""in case"" we had to work from home. That day I requested to be sent home with a laptop so I could work from home.

Lo and behold, a week after that EVERYONE is working from home.

I also was vocal about how this had the potential to get bad. It wasn't until that Friday when people started getting calls from their children's schools that they were shutting down that my co-workers realized, oh shit. It was that following Monday I went in with my mask.

I also stockpiled food a good month in advance but kept that to myself. I didn't want to like...rub it in people's faces. I'm not a prepper. I just simply watched the statistics, watched what was happening in Italy, and did what I thought what was best for my family. 

And now here I am and all I can do is shake my head. Numbers don't lie, people. Logic doesn't lie. The WHO is in bed with China--everyone knows that, or should know that.

I also hope that you get to the point I have. I obviously don't know where you're from, but I also think it has less to do with CPTSD and more with society (although I do think that people with trauma tend to experience what you describe more). The first world countries are so... Advertisement-centric. Society builds you up to want more. More clothes, more money, more cars, more traveling experience, better friends, better houses, a spouse... We're made to want more and nothing leaves us feeling fulfilled.
