relationships,ewuuqvr,t1_ewujvvd,1565792145.0,"For me, what was disturbing was less his opposition to marriage than the fact that he doesn't appear to want to commit. But I think you're right about having another conversation, and really listening to the answer. The vague answers are rough, I'm sorry you went through that. Best of luck to you as well."
