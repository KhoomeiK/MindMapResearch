mentalillness,fr61stb,t1_fr492rl,1589918414.0,"Honestly this is a pretty accurate description of me too, except the realization hit me when I actually got it, and at a younger age. I think there were warning signs when I was much younger, but I’m not really sure if it would’ve happened to me if I hadn’t wanted it so badly."
mentalillness,fr61ho9,t3_gm9yo3,1589918259.0,"Honestly when I was younger I thought it was kind of cool and quirky, because a lot of the shown behaviors in media are dark and mysterious. I was attracted to it. 

Now I actually have it and I seriously regret how badly I wanted that to happen. Kind of like an extreme version of wanting to wear glasses and then realizing it really sucks sometimes."
ADHD,fqr1r7a,t3_gk2c50,1589575982.0,"Definitely consult another professional. I didn’t have to study for anything really up until high school, where my freshman year was absolute hot garbage. It took another year after that for anyone to even suggest that I could have ADHD. 

I know what it’s like to wonder if you’re crazy or dysfunctional because everyone else says you’re fine. But you of all people know yourself the best."
dysthymia,fqkh85b,t1_fqg8z7h,1589427243.0,"Here, here! I think there have been some red flags for my dysthymia during my childhood, but it wasn’t until a depression episode when I was 13 that my mom intervened. I’m super grateful for having a momma who looks out for me so well. But yeah, I struggle with dysthymia a lot still, but I’m sure as hell in a better place than before!"
mentalillness,fq4k6r2,t1_fq44nrl,1589078796.0,"Yeah, what stopped me from getting help or talking to people about it for so long was because I didn’t want to be labeled as an attention-seeker. But honestly? If that’s what it takes to get the help you need, then do it! It just got to be so much for me that it sort of exploded."
NarutoFanfiction,fq4jobq,t1_fq2ug5b,1589078619.0,"Yeah, I see what you mean. I love reading and writing fics, and I definitely won’t stop because people may think it’s weird!"
NarutoFanfiction,fq2qwpz,t1_fq2ngfb,1589058772.0,"My friend and I are trying to establish more honesty, and I just feel sort of guilty about not telling them this? They know I write fiction, but I told them it was all original. I don’t let them read, obviously. It’s just such a big part of my life, since I both read and write it regularly. 

I don’t necessarily want to tell them what fandom I write for, but I know if I tell them then they’ll want to know which. I’ve tried to get them to watch Naruto as well, but they weren’t very interested. Although I don’t know their opinion on fan fiction, I guess the fact that they aren’t all that into what I write about is a little daunting too."
NarutoFanfiction,fq0gz2r,t1_fpz3fjn,1589031716.0,Yeah. Before actually reading and writing myself I thought it was weird too. I’m afraid they’ll have the same reaction.
NarutoFanfiction,fpym918,t3_gfpp4k,1589006193.0,"Honestly, I’ve done both before. I’m prone to writer’s block quite often, so I find it a lot easier to write out the entire thing and then just publish chapters slowly. I’ve also written it chapter by chapter before, too, but there were times I felt guilty because my publishing frequency was a little inconsistent at times."
NarutoFanfiction,fpy8o7g,t1_fpy1c2a,1588998488.0,"Hmm... It’s on my list of fics to read. I’ve gotten it as a recommendation before, so I guess I’ll have to get to it!"
NarutoFanfiction,fpxz2aq,t3_gf6xuo,1588992521.0,"Yes, I have! Or sometimes the description doesn’t match the content at all. It’s amazing to me how many gems are overlooked because of the description alone."
NarutoFanfiction,fpxxcqh,t3_g8jpff,1588991516.0,"If you’re interested in 1 and 9 ideas about Sakura going with Sasuke, I would suggest reading a few works by [Lady Silvamond](https://m.fanfiction.net/u/545474/Lady-Silvamord) on ff. 

I’m thinking specifically of [Lost and Found](https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5441230/1/Lost-And-Found) which is a spectacular fic with SasuSaku and some ItaSaku as well. It’s an absolute gut-wrenching fic and it’s one of the best I’ve ever read. Which is a lot considering how many I’ve read while scouring the internet stories. 

If you’re not opposed to fics with ItaSaku endings, I would also advise reading Lady Silvamond’s [Bluebird ](https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6704243/1/Bluebird) and [Before the Dawn](https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4784395/1/Before-The-Dawn). They’re all smashing pieces I think everyone should read!"
NarutoFanfiction,fpxwabg,t1_fonws98,1588990876.0,"Ohhh, there’s a pretty cute but unfinished fic with a fem!Sasuke. It’s set in a modern world where they’re young adults and Sakura is still a girl. It’s very well-written in my opinion, and it’s worth the read even if it’s unfinished. I love Sasuke’s character and how they’re portrayed. I adore this writer! 

It’s called [Can I Be Yours?](https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12727257/1/Can-I-Be-Yours)  by ChronicallyChill. You should totally check it out! This writer has a lot of other works that deserve being checked out too."
mentalillness,fpwvzhj,t3_gfk1kc,1588970984.0,"A year ago I think I would’ve been angry reading this post; “how can they tell me to just get over it?” 

Today I read this and am genuinely impacted. I think I’ve been comfortable in this place of self-pitying because it’s easier than to try and change. This also makes me realize that I have changed already in comparison to the person I was a year ago. Thanks, Reddit."
mentalillness,fp7po0z,t3_gbj25o,1588375226.0,"Because you’re leaving yourself in a position where the other person’s reaction could hurt you. 

My advice as someone who used to be really closed up? Once you find someone that you can truly trust, just tell them. Don’t even think about it, because then you’ll think yourself out of it. 

Another piece of advice? The more times/people you tell, the easier it gets. Trust me."
dysthymia,fp7pcxs,t1_fp6jj8x,1588375050.0,"I can relate. Switching from a private school to public school curriculum was bad. I had always been able to get by in everything before high school. And then the switch happened. 

Turns out I have always had issues with inattentiveness and that my issues with math weren’t really my fault, but I had been high-functioning, so none of my teachers thought anything was wrong. If you take a look at my childhood behavior…well, that’s a whole ‘nother story."
dysthymia,fp7owle,t3_gbg9jt,1588374793.0,Woah…I was diagnosed with ADHD maybe a year ago? And then also diagnosed with dysthymia a few months after that. It’s good to know I’m not alone.
mentalillness,fnz9i2v,t1_fnybms0,1587389386.0,"Yes, thank you for sharing. I also suffer from nail biting, hair pulling, and skin picking. I also recall some OCD-tendencies in my childhood that my family actually made fun of— brushing my teeth for a really long time to make sure I didn’t get cavities, crying when my mom would start driving before I had buckled myself in, being mildly germaphobic to the point where the rest of my siblings came up with a taunting rhyme and chanted it regularly, etc. 

It’s comforting to know other people out there have had similar experiences."
dysthymia,fnxm37r,t3_g150ak,1587341496.0,"I was very lucky that only the second therapist I’ve had is actually specialized in dysthymia. I saw the first therapist for around two years with them diagnosing me with depression and later on ADHD inattentive type. A few months later I found my second therapist who hit the nail right on the head with dysthymia, after seeing me for a month. Again, I was very lucky. Not everyone is."
