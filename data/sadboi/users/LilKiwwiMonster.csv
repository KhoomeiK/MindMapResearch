Because I may inadvertently teach that fear to my child.  I might teach them shame with that fear. I also wouldn't be qualified to watch my own child without another adult and would be forcing all this burden onto my partner due to my own failures. Now add poop into that phobia/aversion, something humans do daily, plus an exhausted wife who not too long ago carried that baby that now has to do most of the gross work because her partner isn't able to do it. This is definitely something OP needs to seek therapy for and find alternative ways to work around on his own without the need for his partner to save him.

Not only is it extremely rude but also very dangerous for anyone in the LGBTQ community. As someone who's queer, coming out at a religious event (even your own) is always a risky thing to do. It almost guarantees you'll get some form of rejection or hate, at least in the USA. I wouldn't say timing has anything to do with this just the lack of social etiquette and experience. This is more than a read the room scenario. They're honestly lucky this didn't escalate to violence. Better place to tell all family and friends when you're already distant with them and don't talk to your own parents? Facebook. Twitter. Reddit even. You don't have to make a personal event for someone else about YOU just so you can ""feel better"". It seems like OP already didn't feel safe enough with their parents to talk with them as she had already cut them out of her life, why bring this up now? It really seems like OP was egging for a fight or negative attention. The backlash OP gives after asking for advice is what tells me they're either desperately seeking any form of attention or just an extremely toxic person."
AmItheAsshole,fk18tfu,t1_fk132zx,1583774742.0,"And I'm going off the multiple comments OP has made in this thread to clarify their relationship with their parents. I suggest maybe reading those before you think someone else is ""leaping to conclusions"". I also feel (based on all those comments) that this was the straw that broke the camel's back with the previous manipulation OP's mom has done to them. Not to mention I've had quite a few friends with abusive parents that others thought they're overreacting too just because there wasn't any physical violence involved. You can't say what does and doesn't hurt someone or how a traumatic event like losing your beloved animal, that provides unconditional love and companionship, will affect them. Not everyone has parents that are worth continuing communication especially when it seems their intent is to hurt not to care. If not then they should have known better and that there would be actions for being this disrespectful to their child."
AmItheAsshole,fk05qtk,t1_fjnx9ia,1583743119.0,"What makes you think they raised OP comfortably? Or that there was no abuse? The fact that mom makes these decisions AFTER OP states how that makes them feel, it seems like this has been apart of their relationship for a while now, if not her whole life. Just because parents can afford to live ""comfortably"" doesn't mean how they are treating their child is healthy or not abusive. Many old school ways of parenting have been known to be extremely toxic and traumatizing yet people still think it's ok because it's been engrained that its acceptable. I personally wouldn't see myself worthy of being in my child's life if I did something that hurt them this bad. To think this isn't torture is ignoring how humans connect. It's just unfortunate so many other humans would rather hurt others than be something worth connecting with."
AmItheAsshole,fjvkj9v,t3_fexya3,1583628147.0,"NTA. I feel your sister might have some undiagnosed mental instabilities that she's using her ""healthy lifestyle"" to cope with in a very unhealthy way. She needs to stop forcing her own views and opinions of health onto others and let their doctors decide what works best for them. If this were me, probably would have told my sister she's already gonna die before me anyways so make me a REAL CAKE or don't make one at all."
AmItheAsshole,fjnxzss,t1_fjm11dl,1583516587.0,"I mean, I see an abusive and manipulative personality here. This is similar to making your kid sick just so you can feel loved/needed by nursing them back to health. A pet is as important to some as a child especially since some people can't have children. There's more than just 2 sides to the world."
AmItheAsshole,fjnxhff,t1_fjl9ogt,1583516291.0,"Then don't think of it as ""over a dead cat"" and more due to the abuse of their parents. This situation has happened before. OP discussed how traumatic and hurtful it was only a month before this. The parents still did it after knowing how much it hurt their child the first time. Then they get mad at said child for getting angry at them as if OP was supposed to run into their arms for support and not react to the pain all this caused. This is a form of abusive and manipulative behavior."
AmItheAsshole,fjnw8yi,t1_fjlao81,1583515577.0,Not every person is a good person. Thinking that we each deserve forgiveness no matter how we treat others is more idiotic.
AmItheAsshole,fjnvrl1,t1_fjl86pw,1583515319.0,"The other factors are abuse live behavior. OP commented this isn't the first time they've done this, meaning put down one of OPs animals without permission. After that OP talked to them about how hurtful and traumatic that was just a month before this, no one cared to consider that and decided to do the same thing again. Yet they get mad at OP for being angry? They completely ruined the trust that was there by ignoring the communication OP already had with them. Parents are good people just got having a kid, it's how they treat them that counts. These parents don't seem to give a fuck how OP feels even when they flat out say it to them."
AmItheAsshole,fjnv82y,t1_fjlqz84,1583515037.0,This isn't the first time they've done this exact thing to OP and have been talked too about it as well. They clearly knew how OP would feel about this situation and did it anyways.
AmItheAsshole,fjnumkj,t1_fjn6b4w,1583514728.0,You can and there are many recipes for this. It's still just a heated pot but with setting that let it slow cook as well. Depends on what you're wanting to make/how you want to make it.
AmItheAsshole,fjnu1m6,t1_fjlx95x,1583514423.0,"Depending on where the discs are, standing to cook may be far less painful than sitting in or driving a car. Every body is different."
AmItheAsshole,fjntm95,t1_fjm9u1z,1583514198.0,"OP added this isn't the first time this has happened. They put another cat down before for ""peeing everywhere"" while OP was gone overseas/in a different country I believe. This was situation discussed previously to the dad and yet they still took another life that was not theirs to take. I hope OP can file a suit as this is at the very least unauthorized disctruction of property on top of extremely traumatizing. It definitely seems like OPs mom gets off on emotionally wrecking their child and gets pissed when they don't run to her for comfort. This is actually not all that uncommon. Parents aren't good people just because they had a kid. They didnt give two figs about the emotions of their child or they would have actually listened the first time this happened."
AmItheAsshole,fji89cq,t1_fji2ubn,1583362291.0,"They did, their mom didn't listen. You should read through the comments a bit before assuming. The mom seems to want to relive her glory days and missed opportunity in dance through OP who hasn't and doesn't want it. This isn't ever acceptable for a parent to do but unfortunately happens far too often."
AmItheAsshole,fja3up4,t1_fj84xva,1583165823.0,"It seems you put this up thinking the internet would give you points for ""being honest"", failing to understand this is an entirely unacceptable thing to do in this specific circumstance to say the least while blowing up on anyone stating the obvious here and effectively showing just how narcissistic or out of touch with others emotions you are. If you're just going to argue about it and not learn from it, why even bother?"
AmItheAsshole,fiqk7x1,t1_fiqdhdt,1582646077.0,"If she has proof of him admitting it, she absolutely has a case. Even a text can be seen as a ""written agreement"" for small claims."
AmItheAsshole,fif44xg,t1_fiezwwk,1582385390.0,"It may explain the behavior, but it doesn't excuse it. She just might be a pregnant asshole."
AmItheAsshole,fhmnfbc,t1_fhm5c2q,1581715360.0,"I've been married for almost 6 years now and been with my husband for 8. This is entirely a power grab by the wife to control him and force him into the box she's always wanted him to be in. Them getting married gave her the confidence as his ""wife"" to think she knows what's best for him. His wardrobe, what ever it may be, is his and his alone. It seems this has always been a problem for her and yet she still married him. A marriage is not about owning someone else's life, its about sharing your own with another. No one controls either person and communication is a must. Here she just looked over everything they talked about, his emotions included, because she was embarrassed by him and decided to change that without his consent. At this point she has only shown greed from control and narcissism. She can't even acknowledge how horrible he feels or that his trust can never be fully regained again. He most likely will never trust her fully again, possibly dragging around resentment that she purposely caused. She did this to make HERSELF feel better about him, not for him.

If they cared, why couldnt they just take him shopping and show him that he can look good in other clothes? This could even be a trigger for trauma in his past that she just added too with no regards for him as a husband, as a lover, or even as a human adult. The main thing she throw out was his trust. I hope he can find peace and possibly a better spouse if she doesn't fix her narcissistic behaviors."

trashy,f7xm098,t1_f7wgl6p,1574063403.0,"As a Pornstar on said website, and many others, this is far from the truth. Except the background check. PornHub does not ""hire"" any models, they are freelance workers on contracts and do not require the same checks and balances as actually employing someone does. That being said I do feel there are many things the platform can do better. Not just for its consumers, but also its contractors like myself.

FYI, Mia Khalifa doesn't speak for all of us. She also signed bad contracts that gave away the rights to the films she made far before she became super famous. There may have been limited options at the time, but there were still other options for her. With the downfall of DVDs and boom in downloadable content, we don't even need production companies to produce and market content, giving more liberty to each content creator to run their business how they wish. Always read the fine print before you sign. In fact, get a second opinion too. There are many porn veterans that offer business and legal advice for this very reason. Hell, I bet you can find a few on Reddit right now."
