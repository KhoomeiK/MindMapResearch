I think LR STR VB is better than majority of summonable LRs.

LR Babidi and Dabura are better than LR Vegeta/Nappa.

I think STR Cooler supportive abilities are a lil overrated as it tends to be inconsistent in SBR.

Units that allow faster speed runs such as LR Majin Vegeta and STR LR Broly are as integral to units that allow no item runs such as LR INT Cell and LR Vegeta/Nappa."

Vegito Blue taking double digits with one super while dishing out phenomenal damage.

INT UI Goku actually dodging.

STR Rosé + TEQ MZ lowering attack and raising each other DEF allowed them both to take double digits when BBB was active. They also allowed floating units to take less damage."

DBZDokkanBattle,fllm13a,t1_flljv90,1585263101.0,"Being able to excel at various different game modes does define what units are the best in the game. A unit like SSJ3 Vegeta is fantastic in SBR but in LGE? He's garbage for it. He only shines in SBR. Someone like INT Janemba is amazing in SBR and can also function well in LGE, therefore Janemba has more value than Vegeta. 

You're very own argument that you could name better units than Cooler and Bardock for SBR is fundamentally flawed as that's based on your opinion. You can't just say that there are no best units in the game, but then go on to say that you could name 10 better units than Cooler and Bardock for SBR. You're objectively ranking Cooler and Bardock in 10th place for SBR in which is no different from what people rank units for the overall game."
DBZDokkanBattle,fllfyid,t1_fll2j5f,1585259591.0,"What do you mean nothing? You act as if people don't base units on their performances in endgame content. If a unit could excel reasonably well in both SBR and LGE, would you not consider them the best unit in the game? 

Someone like AGL Bardock imo, key word being opinion, could easily fit the criteria. Does well in SBR, excels at LGE, has a good leader skill, hits relatively hard, has a good linkset and has good linking partners. Objectively you could argue someone else is better or could argue that no such unit exists, but again it's an opinion and no one is neither right nor wrong."
