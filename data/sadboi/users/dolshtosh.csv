HeistTeams,fqo51z5,t1_fqnhwj1,1589507718.0,"to be fair i don’t really need it. let me explain why.

Key tips:

- always do this in first person

Entering/Making ur way into the vault:

1) shock the metal detector and wait a couple seconds to let the guards spawn at the front desk (as sometimes they take a bit of time to).

2) since ur only allowed to take out one camera i’d advise to take out the one right next the the metal detectors (to the left).

3) kill all the people in the centre security room (max of two in there) and push through unless u have to take the furthest right door which in that case take out the two guards simultaneously w ur teammate or the double melee method.

4) since were in first person the cameras shouldn’t detect u as u run toward the daily vault/ flight of stairs. but only ouch for it once the guard patrolling that section is pushing towards the vault and knock him out anywhere at or past the elevator with a melee then proceed to take the daily vault (this is optional).

5) when u get downstair repeat step 3 for the two guards to ur left as u exit downstairs. i personally do the double melee. i enter stealth and hug the elevator wall and then run up to the one of the right and spam circle to melee them in quick succession. or u can go for the simultaneous shots w ur mate but be careful as they move their heads a lot.

6) one person go back to where the two dead bodies are and get re day to shoot the next guard. to trigger this next guard the other persons needs to get close to the doors that lead u to the vault (preferably the left set) and run back towards the stairs. if he goes left both of u should stand back near the two dead bodies and shoot from a distance (just one person). if he goes right then the person who triggered the guy to start moving can walk up behind him on the way to the dead bodies while avoiding the cameras and melee him (this is more riskier out it’s an option tho).

7) now hug the left wall and proceed to make ur way into the mantrap. in the final room first kill the two guys in the middle and then the guy on the far right (if you’ve done duggans shipments but this kill is also optional). these three can be taken out one-by-one.

In the vault:

- just make sure to leave by 10 seconds if the final tray ur looting is in the middle or 15 seconds if ur in the caged ones

The exit:

1) Upon leaving the man trap kill the guard in the middle (potentially wait for any guard in the room with him to leave).

2) hug the right wall (same one as upon the entry) and make ur way towards the stairs.

3) if there’s the two rotating guards u need to be quick or take them out one by one when they’re out the of the stationary one’s (by the elevator) cones of visions. take them out when they’re in the corners of the room

4) make ur way towards the middle security room and take out the two guards in there (both stationary) with melee attacks preferably. from here u can take the daily vault again.

5) while one person loots the daily vault the other person can take the door to the left and kill the guy rotating there just to be extra safe.

6) proceed w caution and avoid all cameras and exit via the metal detectors at the staff lobby exit (the same way u came in).

Outside the staff entrance:

1) run right (NOT ON THE HORSE TRACK) and one person proceeds to melee the guard on the left of the van.

2) hug that left bush wall and u should be able to outpace all the guards. make ur way over wall where u see those blue easy to break fences and keep head in that general direction and take a right. go forwards a bit until u can jump over the green fence to ur left and again to get onto the main road. if the cars aren’t on the opposite side of the road then steal a civilian one (don’t aim ur gun at them just block them and pull them out).

3a) make ur way to the sewers and lose the cops there and follow the whole way through to the high way and go west (left) in stead of the gps route and follow the whole single road highway to one of the three potential buyers.

3b) make ur way to the police station and get to the roof for the helicopter escape (i do this as its not that hard; doesn’t take too long to learn and it’s quicker).

**REMEMBER DO THIS ALL IN FIRST PERSON UNLESS UR IN THE CAR OR IN HELICOPTER!!**

hope this little breakdown helped x"

HeistTeams,fqk6u50,t1_fqjumhh,1589421272.0,"for cash potentially but im certain on four with gold however. me and a friend i met online started casino and couple months back and have learnt all the gold and most of the art configurations. when u enter the vault (in the animation) door 2 will either appear as open or shut. and regardless of that both door 2 configurations have two separate configs to them. here’s best to worst. 

1) best is the “a b c open door” (5 open trays which is equivalent to $3,650,000). on this configuration we’ve managed to get a £4M+ take on silent and sneaky as u can get 6 trays of gold and get the daily vault twice. (VARUN’s configuration 1)

2) then the “a b open door” (only one hack required for tray h while the other person can prepare four open trays). (VARUN’s configuration 3 or 5 - it doesn’t matter yet to me since i do the gold glitch and tray c is a waste of time for whatever the exact configuration is)

3) then the “a b c closed door” (equally as good and the previous mentioned but the single hack is for tray d instead of h) (VARUN’s configuration 2)

4) the worst by a long shot is the “a b closed door” (2 hacks required to get to c and h - u usually take around $3.1M - $3.3M here) (VARUN’s configuration 6)

feel free to correct me but i trust the days of in game time doing b2b gold replay i’ve done over this past month alone. the rest of the configuration apply for cash that i have not stated here. it’s a valid source regardless just don’t get too confused since op didn’t state content of the 6 different configurations clear enough.

cheers for the source and hoped this helps

Edit: i’ll add the associated configuration from his chart to my description over the course of the next few minutes"
