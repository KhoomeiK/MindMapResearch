The bishop and the dude at lds social services convinced me that if I served a mission, stayed faithful and pure, and studied the scriptures, HF would cure me. When HF didn't, I was told to have faith and get married and have kids. I didnt get married. How could I marry a woman I knew I would never be attracted to or aroused by. Two of my zone leaders got married, had kids, came out, got excommunicated and divorced, and are now happy. One married his partner in slc, and the other is a college instructor in the northeast.
