MeatRabbitry,fofiif8,t3_g71g24,1587736618.0,I'll be getting rabbits now for the first (I had a pet rabbit as a kid) time.
MeatRabbitry,fofght6,t1_fofge4x,1587735372.0,Thanks! And it was my very first carpentry attempt. I even used a skill saw. I'm very proud üòÅ
MeatRabbitry,fofg8t7,t1_fofbepo,1587735210.0,"I did! FREE! I found a guy giving a whole bumchaway on Kijiji and picked it up right away. It fell into my lap, really."

MeatRabbitry,fnzmqbg,t1_fnzjsrq,1587396998.0,Thank you! I'll check out your videos and I'm really taking another look at the carpentry route now.
MeatRabbitry,fnzgsf9,t1_fnzgqth,1587393783.0,Sweet! Thanks for the tip!
MeatRabbitry,fnzgp4c,t1_fnzfi0v,1587393731.0,Cool! Where did you get those? Or did you make them?
MeatRabbitry,fnzfrav,t1_fnzfgt4,1587393199.0,"Haha! I was eyeing those up last night! I guess looksust be higher on my list than I thought... What can I say, I am a vain creature. Perhaps if I do something like that but create the cages to sit on top of a base then it might still be moveable!"
MeatRabbitry,fnzfi1l,t1_fnzfavw,1587393052.0,Oh! That's a big deal. I was having trouble finding proper wire online (I'm in Edmonton... There must be something here!!!) but I'll have to keep asking around
MeatRabbitry,fnzf49p,t1_fnzf0ig,1587392835.0,I don't want my neighbours to hate me too much. They can see it from their house where I'm putting it so it would be nice to keep it looking nice for them too.
MeatRabbitry,fnzf0ig,t1_fnz8ubf,1587392774.0,Not gonna lie... The visual appeal is nice! Haha
MeatRabbitry,fnzey2w,t1_fnz8ddg,1587392735.0,Awesome. Thank you so much for your answer! I wish things were open right now to go dig through... I LOVE Restore!

Question.... Do you ever ""gloat"" after you're done? I find when I do something special I look at it over and over and I don't know if that obsessive behaviour is normal..."

""helicopter parent"" usually implies that the parent is obsessively concerned with the child's safety and wellbeing. You mother is not that. I'm so sorry you are going through this. What you have is a mom obsessed not with your safety, but with ensuring that you do not achieve independence. It sounds like she is using you in order to feel special, unique or accepted. But this behaviour is unacceptable. She is not concerned for your wellbeing as any logical adult would realize that repeatedly and thoroughly puncturing a person's privacy (and what should be very clear personal boundaries) is destructive, at best. The trackers are unacceptable. You should not have to feel monitored or surveiled upon as a teenager. Ask yourself what her intentions are based solely on her actions - try to set aside anything she has said about the actions as words are easily created to be misleading, excuses, and manipulative. In this case, let her actions be what you focus on. You are not old but you are old enough to ask yourself - is a healthy relationship built on trust? Does my relationship with my mother demonstrate trust on both sides? Given this answer, is this a healthy relationship? 

Once you've given that thought, it will be time to grow towards a change. There is a lot of good advice from others. The basics remain; seek help from another trusted adult. Immediately and with great urgency dedicate yourself to creating healthy boundaries for yourself. Learn to define those boundaries and enforce them. 

The future you have in front of you is a difficult one. I wish I could tell you she will change and take the lead in owning her behaviours and changing them, but the reality is that you will need to work very hard on yourself and your relationship with her for a long time before you are ok. I wish you the very best with this. Be strong and courageous."
