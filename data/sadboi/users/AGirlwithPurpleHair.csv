My best advice as someone who works with workers in these kinds of scenarios on a daily basis is to just sit down and have a conversation with them first. Look for a second job to make up the lost income, or unless you're thinking of quitting. Chances are they won't fire you because they will have to pay you out.

If you don't mind my asking, have you been there over 5 years, or coming up on your 5 years. And also, is it a large company (payroll of over 2.5 million)? Because severance and termination packages are different..

 If the conversation of a temporary lay off does come up, weigh the pros and cons depending on how long they're thinking the lay off might last. Make sure any documentation given or signed off on states what was discussed! Make sure, if they do agree to a temp layoff, that it says that. They have 13 weeks to give you your position back before it becomes a permanent lay off."

DO THIS WHILE THE GAME IS RUNNING!

\-Open task manager

\-go to details and find launcher.exe, rdr2.exe, playrdr2.exe and rockstar.exe (or something like that, you'll recognize the rockstar icon and rdr2, choose those)

\-set rockstar launcher (both rockstar icons) to low priority by right-clicking, set priority, low

\-set rdr2 to high priority. 

\-close task manager (or minimize) and play game or whatever

The quickest way I figured out if the fixes would work was to run benchmark tests. I was able to run a test successfully after doing this. I haven't played so I don't know for sure that it's a good or even a long-term fix, but I'm happy that it didn't crash within a minute of running the benchmark, which in theory, should apply to the gameplay.

Usually if there are discrepancies, WSIB does an investigation. However, WSIB is a shit show of a system and is incredibly understaffed and underfunded, and ultimately screws you over. But the paper work is incredibly important to have regardless so there is a paper trail. I would ask the employer for their policies and procedures regarding incidences like this and ask for a copy. They legally have to give you one. Also, review your contract and see what it says about sick days. It's shitty that legally they don't have to do anything if you say you're sick, including notifying other employees, but that's basic ESA. It's simply that - basic. Also, I believe security guards have exemptions under the ESA. And sick leave isn't covered under OHSA, but I THINK (don't take my word) WSIB protocol might be briefly covered. Also, check with WSIB. Make sure you follow up with all the paper work, and if you noticed anything incorrect, you should NOT have signed it. I'm pretty sure you're able to read and have to sign off on it.

You can usually find ""packs"" at department and pet stores but again, no need to go fancy. I would definitely get some sort of scratch post unless you don't mind your personal furniture getting scratched up. I personally prefer something that is either carpet or rope - I hate the cardboard ones, they're very messy. Again though, you can usually find these fairly inexpensive and it doesn't have to be large at all. From there it'll depend on the cat. Some cats prefer their own bed, some don't care; some have specific toy preferences, other don't care for toys at all. You get to know the personality of the cat and you figure it out. I'd also recommend treats and wet food on occassion. Wet food is good because cats don't tend to drink a lot of water so it keeps them hydrated (and if you're on a budget, I like to take a small amount of wet food and mix it with a little but if warm water to make the wtlet food stretch a bit more).

I'd say between 4yrs - 7 yrs. Make sure to get to know the cat before adopting, spend time with it if you can. If not a cat, then I'd do some research on a smaller pet like a gerbil, hamster, or even a rat. Rats are a bit more high maintenance, but if you get two, they'll socialize each other, but also, if you train them too, they can spend lots of time with you too. It's not so much about how long you'll be gone during the day, it's about how much you're willing to invest when you do have the time. I leave my cats and turtle home along for 8-10 hours a day, and when I am home, as long as I invest some time into them, they're super happy animals. Don't get a dog though. They have a hard time keeping up with busy schedules. And I wouldn't suggest anything aquatic or anything that takes a super large habitat. Regardless, do your research on the animal.

And then it's wanting to cry at random times. Like I'll sometimes get the urge to cry while listening to a really happy song driving down the road because some random memory pops into my head that reminds me how fucked up I am and there isn't much that I can do about it. I'll always have that memory."

raisedbynarcissists,evz3jt5,t1_evz2q07,1564948076.0,"That makes so much sense. I'm not terrified of being vulnerable - or maybe I am - it was jst always the thought that it's not going to get me anywhere, not going help, no one cares, so why bother? Fuck it sucks."
solotravel,evsqhbn,t1_evsqau6,1564753832.0,I'm not looking to travel abroad - right now. I mean it would be sweet but I don't think it's tangible. Like I said: solo trip from Ontario to BC would be perfect right now. Jst gotta figure out how.

Pets,etyw79s,t3_ce5gp2,1563323558.0,"It sounds like a huge screw up on the vets part. I would call and see maybe if this vet is new or something; at least inform whomever so that this hopefully doesn't happen again. It's a pretty heart wrenching experience when it does go how it's supposed to. I had to say goodbye to my cat this morning and they had given him a sedative which made him more disoriented than sleepy and lethargic but the vet tech did say it was only a small amount. He was calm though which was a relief. The actual vet told me that all it is, is an overdose of anesthesic. 

That sounds horrifying and I'm really sorry you had to go through that. I would definitely inform the office and hopefully your mourning is a little bit smoother."

HappyPlanners,eq36546,t1_eq31gq3,1559750187.0,Yea it's a very poor selection here. Even in bigger cities. And it sucks that you can't order online from Michael's.
