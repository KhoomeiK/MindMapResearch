I was shocked at times how many mothers would sell their children for sex or drug money to people. I kept a tab on how many pedophiles I managed to successfully testify against, but felt it wasn't enough. I felt the government and some of the country bureaucracies let me down. 

If you're interested in reporting more, they're always hiring. You don't have to look at images or videos at all, you can do blue team stuff which is advocating against pedophiles and sexually abusive images. You can support child protection advocacy online. BACA and NOMAD are large volunteer agencies aimed at saving children and bringing them home. Project Karma in Australia is another NGO that helps save children from sex trafficking. You know what pedophiles want, their secret words to entice victims, and their behaviors. You can use that knowledge to protect children from their influence. Good luck!"
