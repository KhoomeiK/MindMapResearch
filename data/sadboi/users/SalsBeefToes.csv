depression,fd2reat,t3_ejvcf6,1578150879.0,"Just turned 16 and to be honest, it's been rough. Depression is one tough son of a bitch to live with. 
I want to see my friends and go crazy and stupid like kids are meant to, but I just never have the energy. I did once a long time ago, but around my 4th grade year things started to go downhill.
I understand man, life hasnt been easy for us."

depression,fc6b7ci,t3_egdm43,1577476512.0,"Society pushes us to think we need to be set and ready to go at 18, but it takes so much longer. Its okay to be at different spots, you're doing everything you can. Life is stressful. No amount of preparation can truly prepare you for what it's like. Theres no shame in 'pathetic jobs'. A jobs a job man, they're gonna suck ass but its gonna get so much better later on. 
I'm really young, freshly 16, so I'm not too smart on finances and all that but- maybe try to save off to the side? I get what it's like to live with family that you cant get along with or bring you down, and it's really hard. Look for small places off to the side. My mom took buses from New York to Ohio just to escape her life. Sometimes, you just need to get away from it. Start a new in a town, state, somewhere with a job and just book it. 
I dont have the best advice, but I do get the feeling of loneliness and worthlessness at your young age. You feel like you cant amount to what you've been told should be the base line- but we can. Sometimes it might just take a little while, but you're not alone. Theres people in this boat with you, you can do it man. Keep going."

I've attempted suicide before, I've been told I'm just being selfish and I dont really want to die. Its absolutely crushing to feel and have confirmation that when I die, they will not care. 
 Theyll blow it off as some freak accident, cry, and then forget. The cycle repeating over, and over, and over.
I'm hurting, I've never learned how to stop hurting, but all I can do is try. Whether I lose my battle or not, I'll try."
depression,faf0eqb,t3_e8w8td,1576011906.0,"I'm so sorry man, suicide is something that you can never completely spot. I'm sure you did everything you could to be a good friend of hers. Dont ever blame yourself for this sort of thing, it is never your fault. Especially since you two were friends. It'll hurt, and it's okay to hurt. Let yourself grieve, but keep in mind this is not your fault."
depression,faeqsvq,t3_e8ptmb,1576006253.0,"Hey man, I completely understand your pain. Loneliness is the most crushing feeling in the word when it all comes down to it. Being met with only tidal waves of disappointment when all you've ever done is try your best. I need you to know that you did EVERYTHING you could and that's all people should ever want from you.
You've done nothing wrong, you deserve everything you could ever want. You deserve a chance to breathe after everything you've pushed yourself to become. You deserve to love and be loved by those who are worthy of it. 
OP, I'm so sorry that we have to suffer through this- but by god you are not alone through this all. There are so many people out there who will willingly sit beside you and coddle in the comfort that you are not alone. 
It's not fair, god almighty it's not fucking fair we have to deal with this. Putting every bone and drop of blood we have forward trying to succeed and only being met with the crashing of hammers and screams of ""try harder"". 
We can do this, it's going to be okay. Even if it takes years, we are NOT alone. We will not let our screams of agony be forgotten in this world, all we have to do it keep trudging forward, together."

Thousands of hands ripping at my chest and drowning me in a pool. I can't breathe, my pathetic lungs shriveled and bruised with the memories and smoke of the past.
My heart is aching in the cavernous hall of the size it used to be. My arms and legs have lost all sensation and are dead weight, no use to me anymore.
Most of all, I feel completely and utterly alone through it all."

I'll do my best to see if my local shelters will take volunteers to fulfill a good women's dreams. I happen to love animals too and I'm more than happy to help out.
Again, my deepest condolences. I know how it feels to lose someone close to you, especially someone who helped you emotionally and socially."

I never really has the chance to grow into someone in the first place, I dont know where to pick up the pieces. I can hardly manage to eat and smelling food makes me physically sick.

depression,f1y4yfu,t3_db0bhz,1569809496.0,"I pondered it for a long time, life really does fuck you right in the ass when it comes to depression. I can only imagine it's something like sleep, or just the simple vastness of nothing. We just dont exist anymore really, it's like the gaps of our dreams or the nights we dont dream at all, but for forever. Because once we die, we're gone and never coming back. Which can be horrifying and both wonderful in the end. Death is painful in the end really, all we feel in most forms of suicide is absolute agony and then- nothing. Darkness, no thoughts, feelings, or a chance to get up again and live. Were just sunken bodies that suffered immensely in life. 
Having someone die is, life changing. My friend died 3 years ago yesterday and- the impact it left was astounding. You always think death is easy to outrun, but it effects everyone. I always think to myself, what is he feeling? But hes feeling nothing, hes gone. Hes gone and no matter how hard I scream and cry hes never going to come back. Death is horrifying, its irreversible and scarring to anyone involved. I miss him, so fucking much and someone will miss you too. Life, is not fair. It's not fair and we shouldnt have to put up with it, but the only thing we can do is keep going and try to get back up. We can escape the shit storm that is depression and mind crippling disability together, even if it takes us years we can feel good to be alive again. One day, even if it's so incredibly far away- one day we can be better again. Tell the world to go fuck itself and that we made it, because you're not alone. We're not alone- and we can do this no matter how draining and destroying it is."
depression,f1pruc2,t3_daejgn,1569687070.0,"I get exactly what you mean. What I try to do //I'm still currently in high school// is stick with the people that make life bearable? I'm struggling with a shit ton of illness and sometimes I just wanna give in. I genuinely dont have an answer for everything you've been though, I'm still having trouble finding them myself. Life isn't fun, it sucks we work over 50% of the time and get none for ourselves besides a check that BARELY sustains our lives. Life is more of what you can really admire in the small moments you have? Like an inch worm on your finger or the casual snail on your apartment sidewalks. You dont need a huge goal I've discovered, you can keep working on to see your neighbors fat fluffy dog everyday or perhaps just the warmth of the sun, maybe even the snow. The small things are the ones I've been able to hold onto and give meaning to."

AskReddit,f0mugwr,t3_bhzj48,1568753417.0,"A kid I was friends with from my elementary to the 7th-grade school year was killed in a hit and run on his way to school. He was 12. He was riding a bicycle at 7 am around late September and crossing a small dip in the sidewalk outside a local speedway, then a car pulled out and hit him without noticing and continued for over a mile. They're getting out of jail this year, this happened in 2016.

A sweet guy, pretty short for his age but never failed to make people open up and feel accepted. He lit up our lives and made others laugh. 400 people showed up to the school assembly we put up for him. He was well known in the community and was going to play in our marching band the following year. Our uniforms now have a button on the gauntlets to remember him by. The 28th is the third year anniversary."
