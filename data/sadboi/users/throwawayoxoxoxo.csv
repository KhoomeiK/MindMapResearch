Except he killed himself minutes after I broke up with him. He did it while he was on the phone with me. Bullet to the head.

It’s been 8 years.

It will take years, but IT’S NOT YOUR FAULT.
It took a LONG time for me to accept that.

Take time to yourself. Admit yourself back in Psych if you need to. (I did.)

My family, the detective, my psychologist and his family had to constantly reassure me that he made the decision. 

So remind yourself that. 
She made a decision and you were absolutely not to blame. 

In that time, I cried every night for months.
I sought grief support groups and even a medium (crazy, but I felt this desire for closure.)

Grieve, but remember you didn’t kill her and you didn’t tell her to kill herself. She made that decision on her own. 

Please reach out if you need to vent."

Initially, I had thought the same thing, but verified with the tech.

They were no notes from the doctor and we’re going to place focus on my ovaries. Which is why I had to abruptly cancel."
