You might be tempted to ""clear the air"" with people and it may lead to further frustration and heartache. Occasionally it works, but rarely so because your ex is so good at manipulating people. They won't change their mind until they experience him intimately themselves. Ns are good at making friends, but lousy at keeping them for this reason.
