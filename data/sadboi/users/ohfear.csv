your composition is there somewhat but the production could be much better. while that's said, usually it's a good idea to put an extra element or two on the final chorus (synth lead/similar, you get it)

i'd say either pick better samples or mix them better. you don't need a big bassy kick when you have a thick bass such as this. but the clap needs to pop more! put some comp/EQ on that baby. 

the synth chords take up too much space in the middle where the (actually good bass) is. while that is, boost your low end for this style.

also, ditch the autopan on the first synth. it's distracting!"
shareyourmusic,ff8nrvw,t3_es51rk,1579687853.0,"this is REALLY good pop. i'd love the bassline to be mixed more prominently - maybe lend it some mix space from the kick! i don't know if you put some auto-pan or something over the keys but it's a bit distracting. i would've just used a regular stereo pan?

regardless, the vocals and percussion are mixed SUPER well. love the backup vocals (they should be panned too!)

Opeth,fc5iyza,t3_egbhon,1577458892.0,"Every album has something good to offer imho, but if you want to get taken around the breadth of their sound, you should check out:

1. Morningrise
2. My Arms, Your Hearse
3. Blackwater Park
4. Damnation
5. Heritage

My Arms and Blackwater Park each show unique sides of the band as a death metal act (My Arms being abrasive, having some incredible heavy riffs and great classical guitar sections, Blackwater Park more layered and intricate and a bit more of a pleasant experience overall) and in my opinion the other albums from the same eras do much the same except less impressively. Notable exceptions are Orchid and Morningrise which encompass melodic death metal and hints of black metal? I ended up picking Morningrise over Ghost Reveries because it stands more strongly out from the rest of the discography than the other. I'd check it out in your own time if you want to, but Ghost Reveries strongly leans on the foundations built in Blackwater Park

Damnation is critically acclaimed and most agree that it takes the best of the softer elements from the era and lifts them to a higher level. Heritage is such a unique album in its own right that I can't help but encourage you to listen to it."

schizophrenia,fafrvyx,t3_e8yh2w,1576030335.0,"My mother is schizophrenic and has been for a long time. No one knows exactly when but she has been in some strange New Age sect stuff over 20 years ago and for several years after I was born. Not that that's a sign since even nonpsychotic people get roped into that mess... Undiagnosed till 10 years ago, she was pretty good at hiding it from everyone. She suffers from a lot of paranoid delusional tendencies regarding the government, police, the healthcare system etc. anyone she perceives as some sort of authority. Audio hallucinations on top of that manifesting as voices, which she for better or worse interprets as being a psychic medium. Uses that to fuel a very unsuccessful career within spirituality/homeopathy/healing, gets very easily sold on things and I'm worried she gets scammed way too often buying flower medicine, crystal balls etc. Can't hold a job and never managed to finish her degree in psychology sadly. Unfortunately got to live with her for ten years (four of them solo with her and my sister once she divorced my dad, ugh). 

We're in a much better place now but she only falls further and further, unable to support herself very much and relying mostly on her mother (my grandmother). I would like to give her more care and attention but she often seems totally beyond my reach. She doesn't believe that I can hold any authority and ends up being extremely bossy with me. Throw conservative homophobic values on top of that and she's real tough to deal with. I'm glad that I can recognize that it's not her mental disorder that's making her awful - she's got a lot of issues that aren't related to that. Gives me a bit of hope for myself."

I don't think having a ""type"" defined for you is a bad thing - in fact, it's very good to have your needs and wants clearly defined, so that you will be able to seek out those qualities in people who you want to date! Everyone has some thoughts about what an ideal partner would encompass, but not everyone will be able to put those thoughts into words. To address your question, it's a poor situation to not be able to express your needs to yourself and others.

If you're worried about losing opportunities because you exclude people from your selection due to them not falling into your type(s), you shouldn't be! Not everyone is a good fit for you. Personally, I think that being picky about your potential partners is better than using your energy on someone you're not entirely convinced upon. Someone who is good for you *will* make you feel good, and then you won't be in doubt! However, you need to be able to feel for yourself if they make you feel good in a wholesome way, rather than unwholesome (is it infatuation or attraction? Are you attracted to some external traits such as appearance, mannerisms, status, etc., or are there some strong personality traits which resonate with your own?). It's all about being in touch with your feelings, and being confident in yourself is the first step towards that."
