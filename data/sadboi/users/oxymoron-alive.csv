The name of the town ""Arcadia Bay"" is a hint that someone is dead. Or will be soon. And you must learn how to grieve and cope with the fact. The fact that what's done is done, that you can't go back and save them, that life is a cruel mistress. It's a very interesting game also based in twin peaks! Very cool."
AskReddit,fr0cmwt,t1_fqzhruj,1589790913.0,Right? And also the name Arcadia Bay lets you know that someone already died or is about to die and you have to cope with the fact. Remember that you must die.
