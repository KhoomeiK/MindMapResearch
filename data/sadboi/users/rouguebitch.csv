BipolarReddit,fr5z8eu,t3_gmtius,1589917145.0,"Sucks. You can’t get any rest and you start the day with a ton of anxiety. I used to get reoccurring dreams and nightmares often. I can also lucid dream. Now I smoke so much THC I never dream. Good riddance! It was all nightmares or uncomfortable situations that robbed me of my ability to heal at night. Never take melatonin for sleep, it makes dreams vivid and so bad dreams can feel terrifying long after you have awakened. I truly hope you find a way to free yourself from this. I did, good luck OP."

He dumped me several times and then for good and he left the state we were in. I knew I needed him back and if I didn’t he would always be the big love of my life. I tried repeatedly to get clean, I traveled across the country and when I had enough sobriety under my belt to reach out which was about a year after our breakup I proposed to him. Repeatedly. I had no shame, I’m bipolar and knew I was being the “crazy ex” but I didn’t care. It was more important to show him how much I still loved him. He moved to be with me all the way from the Deep South to the coast of California. He has been here a year now and we will be getting married this summer on the beach with only a few people. We planned it that way before the shelter in place orders so none of this should disrupt our plans because we both agreed on bare bones simplicity. I don’t even care about rings. I tattooed his name on my finger while he was on the bus ride here and he didn’t skip a beat when I showed him lol. You just know I think. I would do anything for or to him."

Many hairstyles inspired by those comics done by me to me and my friends in my moms bathroom. I will have to check them out and I look forward to some day in the future when it’s safe to browse and get all nostalgic.

bipolar,fqkvir5,t1_fqkrye6,1589437508.0,I’m sure you are lovely and smart and interesting to be around. We are so capable of looking at men’s flaws and excusing then why naturally couldn’t someone do the same for us? My boyfriend has to deal with my anger and I deal with his long quiet moods. I had to quit drinking and using drugs and he had to move across the country to be with me so it wasn’t easy. We are finally really getting to the sweet spot after years of turmoil. Amongst that turmoil things still always felt right. You can trust yourself to know when you find that person. Then hold on to them for dear life. I think we all have a perfect freak out there somewhere.
bipolar,fqkoms4,t3_gjebwf,1589432144.0,"Stop trying to change who you are. Find someone who fits you. I didn’t like being judged for my suicide attempts so I looked for guys who had been in the mental hospital before. I don’t like the porn industry so no dudes who watch porn. I love sex so I always fucked on the first date and weeded out the bad lays. Football and video games take too much attention away from me so I’d sleep with guys who had those interests but not date them. And lastly, no mama’s boys!!! I may sound like a total brat because I am, I’m also marrying my perfect love this year after five years of dating on and off. I love him so much! We can’t get enough of each other in and out of the bedroom. The thing to top it all? He was just diagnosed bipolar. Now wonder we had this strong bond based on feeling understood for the first time. It took me over a decade to find him so don’t give up, and don’t change your self to fit any man. I know you’ll find them."

Anyway you get the point. As a bipolar person it sounds very familiar but it takes a doctor to know. My boyfriend was recently diagnosed bipolar and after dating on and off for five years that would be my last guess! So they know things we can’t know. I hope you seek help because your life will get better if you get treated. Good luck."

bipolar,fpul4zi,t3_gf88rx,1588915818.0,Tattooed the word CUNT on my foot whilst manic. Yours is. better lol. Also at a different time I tatted my now boyfriends (then ex) name on my finger. When we finally reunited I knew it was meant to be that he wasn’t scared off by the gesture. Turn out he is bipolar and was probably manic when he moved cross country to be with me lol. Good times.
Columbus,fpuj66r,t3_gfltj0,1588914284.0,I know how you feel. I’m in California and everyone has to wear masks in businesses.

I also run the Shop alone because we are short staffed and sanitize everything all day. Get ready to have a way heavier work load with no extra pay involved. Less in fact since we both depend on our tips.

bipolar,fppcgmy,t1_fpokka9,1588799770.0,Wow that’s interesting. I have fooled around a little with CBD and it’s really great stuff! I went on an acid trip that I believe changed my personality luckily for the better! Self affirmations in the bathroom mirror as a teen before I knew what self affirmations were. I was always worried I would end up the one trip too many type. Hell I may already be! THC like any other hallucinogen is definitely done at the risk of the user. I like that you were still able to find a good level for you. Maybe one day I’ll brave the world sober and I applaud anyone who does.

bipolar,fpnekrw,t1_fpmnotd,1588760182.0,That sucks. I just tell people and tell them I’m on lithium which even people who don’t know mental illness will recognize that medication. I always apologize after I’m moody or a total ditz at work but I think people are understanding because I’m exceeding their expectations. I am lucky to live in a super progressive place and in the past I did try to fit in at work specially if I felt I would be at a disadvantage somehow if people found out I was bipolar.

BipolarSOs,fph40ri,t3_gdfzzk,1588614576.0,This is also about respect. My boyfriend and I are both bipolar. We put all the money in his account and we both work. We always discuss every purchase. Shit he just gave me a heads up about buying subway and asked if he should wait until we buy groceries. I told him to get his food and it saves money not being hungry at the store. Neither one of us want the other person to go without due to overspending. All the bills get paid and everything is fair.

santacruz,fp8e2w4,t1_fp88zol,1588389983.0,True. My grandmother grew up as a child during the Great Depression. She hand wrote me a book on lined notebook paper about her life growing up. That checked my badass 17 year old attitude so fast! She is 90 now and I have so much respect for her. I think she is my favorite person ever since she gave me that. We were pen pals for years after. I need to think about that book more. It always gave me strength but was unfortunately destroyed in hurricane Katrina since that’s where I grew up and was still living at the time. Jesus! I was a teenager then too. Well thank you for that insight I’m going to put more thought in that comparison. It really did used to help me.
santacruz,fp88tzp,t1_fp7x12s,1588386401.0,Holy moly! I’m lucky that I don’t have a rowdy crowd. Anywhere that sells alcohol and tobacco must be getting all sorts of entitled fiends right now. Stay sharp and I hope soon the worst of them will accept this is our new reality.
santacruz,fp888lw,t1_fp6r6uj,1588385985.0,Thank you!! Also the owner happened to come by and liked my ideas. He also let me put a huge homemade sign I made earlier at work up by the door and it helped.

santacruz,fp87z93,t1_fp6tb45,1588385805.0,"Thanks! I bought some stuff to make a giant sign and made it during the time I spend cleaning and sterilizing, not neglecting my daily tasks of course.

I will still have a voice on my birthday to laugh with loved ones I’m very happy. Thank you so much! Everyone here helped a lot."

Today the owner happened to drop by and I told him my ideas and he approved the huge sign I made on my shift to put by the door. So yay! Very reasonable solutions and I do think the sign helps. It doesn’t help some folks being stupid in a variety of other ways but all that really comes with the territory.
santacruz,fp874w8,t1_fp6w7ns,1588385218.0,"Lol weird yes, no one can dampen the spirit of this place. Today I put in place all the changes I could control. My boss was happy to put up the SC official signs and I even made my own to greet our guests. I think I grew up a little, even though I’m sure I will get frustrated along the way but now I’ll approach more problems asking myself what I can do or change. Thank you for your reply, each one really has meant a lot to me today. I could cry!"
santacruz,fp86p13,t1_fp6y8s1,1588384906.0,"Thank you! Yes progress indeed. I took my new info to my boss and also made a big sign of my own by the entrance. He doesn’t work on site but happened to come by and approved my sign and asked the manager to print up the official ones. Times are crazy right now and it made me realize that stepping up and putting changes in place myself might make things run more smoothly for everyone involved. 

A little birthday lesson perhaps!"
