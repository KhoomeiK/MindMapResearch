AsianBeauty,fonnv5d,t3_g81evs,1587923053.0,I do. Multiple weights especially. I can't use the Hada Labo Gokujyun line for that reason.
30PlusSkinCare,fonb4h3,t3_g8cbe7,1587916050.0,Sunscreen. Then retinol if you can tolerate it. I do better with AHAs personally. Vitamin A derivatives irritate the heck out of my skin.
30PlusSkinCare,fonawng,t3_g8cieh,1587915924.0,"Hydrating watery lotion, then seal it with a thick occlusive. At night I use either petrolatum or the Neuteogena Norwegian Formula hand cream. Bag Balm also works well for this, but it stinks. Haha. Apply before bed and you'll wake up with baby soft hands. I work in a BSL-2 lab, so I wash my hands a lot."

LateStageCapitalism,fon6ipp,t1_fon4utq,1587913309.0,"Again, we already have a 5-4 Court and it doesn't matter mathematically if it's 6-3 or 5-4. As much as I do want leftist judges, Biden won't nominate them and they won't get through without a left Congress, particularly in the Senate. It doesn't fucking matter if he nominates another Ginsburg - which, let's be real, he wouldn't. That person would still need to get past the hearings and votes. 

He blocked Bork but then voted for Scalia, allowed Anita Hill to be savaged which enabled Thomas. 1 and 2. So......"
LateStageCapitalism,fon6335,t1_fon4ynq,1587913044.0,I'm a woman. I know what is at stake. I also know that years of voting for neoliberal center-right hacks like Biden has led to this. Gaslight someone else.
LateStageCapitalism,fon5zf7,t1_fon59uj,1587912979.0,"""Everything you said is true but vote for my neoliberal, warmongering rapist instead of theirs""

No."
LateStageCapitalism,fon5w7w,t1_fomj4hu,1587912923.0,Wrong. Learn about the SPD.
LateStageCapitalism,fon5u6g,t1_fon1aav,1587912888.0,Because a lot of the people brigading in here are liberals who will go back to sticking their heads in sand if Biden takes office.
