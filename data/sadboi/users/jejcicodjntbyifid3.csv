SeriousConversation,fr64v8f,t1_fr5vnem,1589919955.0,"Part of me also wonders... There are people who are naturally attracted to dogs, horses, fish, whatever. Same sex, different sex, old people, young people, whites, Asians, ... Some of these are only attracted to those select groups, and it isn't a conscious thing, it's a ""ew I don't find anything else even slightly attractive""

So I think part of this plays into it as well. The scary part is...are they attracted to children like I'm attracted to brunette women?

Because I did not consciously choose for this to be the case, it's just the way I am or have been.

That makes me imagine myself in their position - imagining myself as someone who, instead of being attracted to red heads or only attractive to white\asian\whatever, now I'd be attracted to kids instead?

Shit man. That's a hard card to be dealt with. I'm fortunate enough I'm attracted mostly to people that I can get with and that it is acceptable to do so...I couldn't imagine not, essentially being celibate my whole life because of being created like that

I don't think this is something anyone ever considers. Everyone is all ""ew child rapists"" but I think there's far more to it than that. And far more factors at play

Though I do think there's a behavioral difference between people who go out and rape versus those who don't act on those feelings...I do agree and think that it is mostly a power thing though in the cases exhibited"

Jesus man your family, what the heck. Who tells someone they'll never be good at something?! Family and friends are supposed to boost you up, not kick you down

Have you taken private lessons? That's what I was thinking of doing because I've heard in several lessons it can radically improve someone, especially over the course of a year of dedicated practice, versus on their own

Right now I don't sing at all. If people are drinking and singing, I won't even. Basically any situation at all, I'm even too anxious to sing in my apartment or really anywhere alone even. I just don't know how to use my voice at all. I don't yell like...ever, either so maybe that doesn't help"

Yes...by contrast filtering is much different than having to put yourself out there again and again and again and again, which has been proven to be physically painful and emotionally detrimental.

Online too. Take a look at guys profile pics, then look at women's. There is, from what I've seen, at least 10x more on the girls, and I'm not even talking about models or anything out there like that I'm just referring to average people. Even on hot guys pics, it is mostly guys commenting on it. I think I've been told I'm hot by more gay guys than women

So I think many of us guys have no idea we are, or the concept is so foreign to us. We don't get told that sort of thing, so when a girl does happen to step out and do it - it really catches our attention and makes us feel good for a little bit

...Then they rip out hearts out and stomp all over it 😂

But it's tricky because men are supposed to - more than anyone else, be confident. If we are not, if we are not confident, if we do not pursue and put ourselves out there, our odds of finding people is actually really low, the odds of keeping them, also lower.

It's honestly no surprise to me that men commit the most violence.

Sleeping doesn't do anything, if anything it can make it worse. I have bad anxiety when I wake up as of late, the only thing that keeps it down is meditating before\after. Meditating is done with the conscious mind, building resilience. Sleeping is done with the unconscious mind, which we don't really have control over (except for lucid dreaming I guess but I've never done that)

Dreaming doesn't help us make sense of anything. All it does is fire off residual signals as our brain burns off and replenishes chemicals, while also being influenced by our state of mind or memories. Eg dreams about our teeth falling apart

I don't believe dreams mean much at all, I see them more as rides that depending on how are mood or events or any other possibility, will take a different path, leading to us having bad or good dreams, or simply nonsensical ones"

Ask any woman and I'm sure they'll have stories of people telling them they ""look tired"" when they don't wear any makeup. Women telling other women they need to put makeup on

Honestly, I hate makeup. It isn't really a choice. It reminds me of wearing ties, except that isn't as common these days. A few decades ago it was necessary for everything

I'm all for choice, but let's not pretend this is really a choice. It isn't a choice if you're raised from when you were young to do so and if you don't you're shamed, that's just an illusion of choice

But mostly, I don't like makeup because it certainly feeds into people's insecurities. To the point where women I've dated and friends will do everything to hide their real face until they put on some makeup. I find that peculiar

Women right now in their 20s are more insecure about their appearance than they've ever been. 

Younger? Forget it, they've got so many issues. We've got most children age groups 12-16 being unhappy with their appearance, to the point where they want to lose weight. Young teenagers thinking anorexia is the way for them to finally be pretty. The trends that we're seeing are so sad

That just gets used for people who don't love themselves enough to accept how they look, so they hide behind it digitally. I've seen this happen all the time and it's almost always women. Which isn't surprising, most women are insecure about their appearance. Even moreso for younger women, and it is getting worse"
dating_advice,fqm6imy,t1_fqjswi0,1589472341.0,"Yep, me too. Recently started dating a girl, talking a bunch(hung out a few times) and we sent some pics back and forth, then I asked for some pics of her at one point after I sent a selfie, she left it on read for days, at which point I was like alright she's not interested, sent a message saying I'm moving on...

She said she saw that and said she doesn't send nudes. And I said...I just wanted to see her face, hence me sending a selfie and asking for the same...

She basically said ""oh I misunderstood, but if you wanted pictures of me there's plenty on my social media"". *Eye roll*. That defeats the point for me. I find it to be a nice back and forth especially these days, but I'm not looking for just old pictures of you that have no relevance to me...lol who cares about that? That's like asking someone questions to learn about them, and you pointing them to where you already answered them elsewhere

Even funnier is a couple weeks before that she sent me underwear nudes for no reason...

Whatever though, at least I tried forming a connection. Her loss, I simply wanted to see her eyes and she assumed the worst... 

First interaction I have had like that, though..."

These days, you're far better off writing it in something that is acceptable for most cases, then going low level when you need to

Whether it be c++with bits of assembly, or Java, with bits of c++. Let the compilers do the grunt work and you optimize what needs optimized"

Hobbies,fqikbsj,t3_gj5esu,1589397141.0,"Well unfortunately not finding joy in the usual activities is a symptom of depression, so I'm not sure if a new hobby is the answer to the problem

Have you put been forcing yourself to do them? Sometimes I have to do that, and then I find out I really liked it and it helped me through a lot of it

Unless you simply mean you're just bored and looking for a change of pace, in which case, nevermind me!"
DecidingToBeBetter,fqi8wuf,t1_fqhtfp4,1589392541.0,"I think in many cases it is awful communication. It seems like most people in these situations don't communicate worth a damn, expecting someone to know what's wrong and what they could do better...

I also think one can't ignore the inner developments of themselves and their psyche. For instance, people gravitating towards emotionally unavailable people, that just indicates their own lack of emotional understanding and intelligence. They haven't gotten to that level yet, so they're still falling victim to the same old mistakes that so many others make

Seems like there's so many emotionally unavailable people out there, and I'm over here just trying to avoid them because they would only bring me lower"
dating_advice,fqhyx8e,t1_fqh5y33,1589386989.0,"I felt this as well. I often feel like I'm a slightly too far on that side of things, not extreme but probably being less like that would be better. But the truth is, I'm kinda that way with anyone. It isn't being a simp or anything, I behave similarly nice for guys. That's the rule of thumb i try to use to keep myself in check. Although I don't text people 24\7, ain't got time for that

Thinking I should be that was less, though. It doesn't seem all that conducive as far as what society wants of people. Some will say that what society wants doesn't matter, but it does if you want to get what you want in life

It isn't that I expect anything, not more than what other people expect. It's just that I like helping people and you never know what good things can come from helping people. It's nice to boost people up. I've had so many great friendships develop because of it. Some terrible, but some great

I think society has double or triple standards for just about everything, and to maximize your success and efficiency in life you have to play ball and fit into it, within reason. Or you'll be left without the things you want

But maybe these are just symptoms of deeper issues in myself. Or maybe they're symptoms of deeper issues in society and what they think is right and wrong"
dating_advice,fqeljl7,t1_fqe4bp4,1589309559.0,"I wouldn't say this is true. If it were, men and women would ask each other out equally. Reality? It's more like 5\95 than 50\50. If I left it to women to ask me out, I'd probably have only ever dated like...3 women. I'm considered attractive and certainly above average in a lot of areas

Also in my experience, women asking me out - or being forward, also has a certain likelihood they have unhealthy behaviors. E.g. just out of a breakup, seeking validation, forcing themselves to feel a certain way. So one must keep a careful eye out for those red flags, just like with the rest of dating

Through years of experience I've slowly begun to realize to keep an eye out for those behaviors. Some of them can be narcissist too (I dealt with a couple of those too)

Having said that I do wish women asked men out more. But society isn't anything like this. Women are the choosers, not the pursuers. There are exceptions and I've met and dated them, but that does not make them the rule, sadly"

socialskills,fqc3aqh,t1_fqbfada,1589249235.0,"Yes, that's how I feel! The thought of it going back to normal removes the excuse, and that would mean I'd have to start worrying about things. I'm quite productive in quarantine, but that's relative to quarantine. 

Going back to everything being opened again and no excuses for something..
That feels different"
therapy,fqatlnx,t1_fqarm41,1589225063.0,">The anxiety asks of the self, ""What are people thinking about me? What if they're judging me? Am I coming across as awkwardly as I feel? Do they like me? What if they don't,"" and so on. The therapeutic relationship is a laboratory; it allows for a safe examination of those questions, the anxiety, and the self

I agree with this, that's my current understanding of it too and it seems interrelated to self-confidence. A lot of it is also that I haven't been exposed to many social situations either, so putting myself in those situations gradually and repeatedly (on my own) has helped a great deal

Not as great as I'd like though, I want to be so much better"
