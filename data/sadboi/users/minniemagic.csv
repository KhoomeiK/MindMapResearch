littlespace,fbccpvc,t1_fb8fzyg,1576720903.0,"Thanks! I do love it but it can be a bit much to manage :( however some tricks that really helped was using color safe shampoo and using pink dye conditioner whenever I need a touch up. But when it fades, my hair is a muted mauvey color so I don’t worry about it fading too much :)"

AskRedditAfterDark,exh3ijn,t1_exglrgq,1566289310.0,It depends! Sometimes I like seducing because I think it’s fun and it gives me a confidence boost when it’s successful. But I do like getting seduced by guys I’m attracted to
ddlg,exgunj1,t1_exgh7us,1566275960.0,Hi can we be friends too??
ddlg,exgh9og,t3_csqr0i,1566264033.0,I would love to be friends!! :)) 💖💖
AskRedditAfterDark,exgge73,t3_csi561,1566263387.0,I’ve been told I have intense “bedroom eyes” even when I’m not purposely trying to seduce anyone. So I like to use that to my advantage. Also touching guys arms and laughing has usually worked for me.
AgeGap,etvl4z3,t1_etvgss9,1563238245.0,I assume guys hate when girls try to get their attention because it can be “annoying”
AgeGap,etv9is6,t1_ett820j,1563229651.0,I’m afraid that he’s gonna think I’m just some little girl that’s trying to get his attention :(
DDLGDiscussions,ett0hte,t3_cd5mc0,1563160746.0,I’d love to be friends:)
DDLGDiscussions,ett0h79,t1_etse7e3,1563160732.0,I would like to join if you’re open to members!
DDLGDiscussions,etsnkbt,t1_etshw50,1563150390.0,I wasn’t really actively searching in the first place but i randomly met him so I was just gonna see from there. But it does make sense to search for someone who already identifies as a daddy
DDLGDiscussions,etsab0o,t1_ets8mlh,1563140428.0,"I’m not gonna lie, it’s pretty uncomfortable for me to call him that. But it’s what he insisted and I was wondering what kind of relationship this would turn into. I haven’t tried to find a dd yet but this guy just gave out of nowhere so I was trying to dip my toes this way. Idk if this is the right way to but I’m just curious."
DDLGDiscussions,ets7uxo,t1_ets7lb8,1563138686.0,Is there a way to bring it up? Or is that not a good idea? I’m a little that wants a dd but I’m not sure what a d/s relationship is like compared to ddlg
DDLGDiscussions,ets2ins,t1_ets2h48,1563134912.0,To full on dominant?
AgeGap,etrzsl4,t1_etrj3vm,1563132980.0,I assumed that he wouldn’t want to hang out with a 22 year old because we’re immature sometimes
AgeGap,etqsvon,t1_etqsrd9,1563100816.0,Lol he knows this already
dating,eto4cyv,t1_eto1l06,1563013091.0,I don’t take offense because I do understand it. I’m not fat or anything but I just used more toning for sure and I’m working on it now. I don’t think I’m terribly ugly but definitely my friends are more beautiful than I am. If anything it’s also a low confidence issue that I’m trying to work on. I don’t think I have the charm my friends have. I can be social and outgoing all i want but I always feel overshadowed by them
AgeGap,etnvqkx,t1_etnviqf,1563002100.0,The reason I was going to ask him to go to a club is because that’s where I met him so I assumed that’s the kind of places he enjoys going to and idk it seems more casual to ask him to go there. I would want to ask him to go to a place that’s during the day or a place that’s more “datelike” but I’m scared that he wouldn’t want to go on an actual date date with me if that makes sense.
AgeGap,etnrq3l,t1_etnq80q,1562997660.0,I’m scared that my lack of experience of going out is making me undesirable. I mean I do like going out and I would love him to show me places but he seems like he’s trying to have me show him places since he just moved to my city. That’s a reason why I’m so insecure because I have no clue about any of the bar/clubs in my area.
SuicideWatch,ethdmsc,t3_cbk8i7,1562812608.0,"I feel this way with when I see best friends, i havent had a true best friend since high school and I feel like its too late for me to get a best friend"

DDLGDiscussions,etep4vm,t1_etapna4,1562740710.0,"Is the person who is religious very religious or just somewhat religious? I don’t have any experience about age gaps but I noticed the religion part and it’s concerning me because I just recently went through a breakup due to religious differences. I’m not saying that your situation is like me by any means but at first I didn’t think being religiously incompatible was a big deal but it ended up being a huge one as my ex and i got more serious. I’m just speaking out from concern and if you wanna talk about that more, I’d be happy to message you about it."
