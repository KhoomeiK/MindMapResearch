Present to her the argument that If she valued  a physical object that she possessed would u her husband campaign to get it thrown out?

Advice,fc7obum,t3_egjzh0,1577514211.0,"I promise u everyone at the gym is focused on getting their work out in and aren’t concerned with themselves.  If anything people are focused on how they look.   Don’t worry at all about just learning. People are very helpful at the gym as well and are more than willing to give u assistance if u ask.    The endorphins are being released in the brain when  at the gym so it’s generally a good energy place where a positive vibe is quite prevalent.        

Do cardio first.  
Then stretch.   
Then use machines.  
  If there is a sauna then go use that after to wind down.      Good vibes and there are people there that are paid to help u.  Book a session with one of them to get exact techniques down to help u.

fantasyfootballIDP,faw7wet,t1_fap63qw,1576367177.0,"Hey bro. Payne is starting. John Oehser from the teams website reporting on it.  I think I’m gonna grab Payne and start him over Mack.  It’s a tough call and in a big play league.  6 points for sacks. 5 for forced fumbles but  I like the solid points that it looks like Payne will grab in multiple tackles.  
Good luck.    Payne is starting MLB against a heavy run team."
fantasyfootballIDP,fariiu0,t1_fapeyzl,1576316500.0,"I saw one single report online from an ESPN reporter Michael DiRocco that the jags “might” start Joe Giles- Harris at middle LB.  But everywhere else I have looked has Payne starting.  Even the coach has commented on the fact that Payne is the Mike LB and they want to keep things simple.  Jack has been going over with him and helping the LB corps.   This one reporter hasn’t said where he has received this info from.    
Is there any further information u have on this matter.   I think instead of going off of “may” and “might” we should  figure this out.      

It seems like Payne is a solid start against a heavy run team that will most likely be up and run it even heavier to close out game on the Jags.   
What are your thoughts.  This is major play call here in a big time game for many of us.      
Thanks for any input."
