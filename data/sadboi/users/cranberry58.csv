JustNoSO,fr5mz8u,t3_gmq97o,1589911238.0,"You are not over reacting.  You need couple’s counseling and if he won’t go, honestly the two of you are sliding down hill at break neck speed to a divorce.  Not trying to be mean about this either.  He has huge insecurity and trust issues and the red flags are starting to look like a blood flow at this point."
JUSTNOMIL,fr5mk42,t3_gmoj8j,1589911035.0,"First bit of advice:  Do NOT follow her on FB!  Who cares what twisted tales she tells to her equally twisted friends?  Blocking her on FB should lower your stress level quite a bit.

Second it:  Honestly, why do you care what she says, thinks, or tantrums about?  No offense.  Just asking why does this woman’s weeping and wailing bother you?  You know you are right in your decisions and choices.  Nothing else has value in this situation.
Or, as I crudely like to put it, if someone farts, will you kneel down and discuss it with their ass?  Consider the source is the nicer version of this."
JustNoSO,fr5lm5p,t3_gmmgqb,1589910572.0,"I (f61) joke with my son about sex, or lack there of.  I do NOT send him porn nor would I ever!  And should he get himself a girlfriend, I will not be making sexually charged jokes in her presence.  Every family sees sexuality differently.  My family was private about the personal side of our sexuality but sex based jokes were okay.  But sharing porn sexualizes the parent-child relationship and that is NOT appropriate."
NatureIsYourEscape,fr5i44x,t1_fr5afmb,1589908932.0,"😂🤣😂 I was never quite that creative with the trouble I got into.  My son loved taking things apart too but he usually (not always) got them back together.  He did ruin my electric pencil sharpener though when he was 7 or 8 by deciding he wanted to see what happened if he tried sharpening the BACK of the pencil.  

I tried to do weird stuff with him to see if I could curtail some disasters.  It helped but there were still a few times when he and a friend or two did something incredibly stupid. I could list each one but I will spare you.  😂"
JUSTNOMIL,fr5guva,t1_fr4282l,1589908349.0,"Your husband really does need counseling to help him see that he can’t save her from herself.

The only person we can ever change is ourselves, and even that can be damned near impossible sometimes."

JUSTNOMIL,fr2qu2y,t3_gm8x3d,1589842147.0,I understand how you feel like she wins if you leave.  The truth is though that this drama and trauma will leave lasting scars on you and your offspring if you stay.  Separate and do it with an attorney involved.  Get a visitation schedule set up and explain in front of your SO that you are seeking to limit her contact because her behavior is bizarre.  Make lists like you just gave us only more detailed.  Write down every burp and fart from her craziness with times and dates.  Make it clear that she and her threatening behavior are why you two are separating and you want protections in place so she can’t practice her crazy on the kids.

But he never lost his love for the subject.  I grew up learning all about the basics from him.  It sparked a life long passion to study the history of architecture.
