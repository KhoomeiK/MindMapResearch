bisexual,foj98wq,t3_g7fia0,1587813391.0,"Hello! 

I'm a monogamous 26-year-old bisexual woman who have felt similarly most of the time and honestly I believed I could never be truly happy in a relationship. When I'm interested in a guy, it's purely sexual, and when I'm interested in a girl I want everything with her but sex. Seems like you can never win. 

When I started dating my girlfriend, I told them ""look, I consider myself a homoromantic heterosexual"" to which they replied they identify as lesbian/ asexual. I know it sounds weird, but to cut a long story short: I am very happy in that relationship and it's the first one that meets both my emotional and sexual needs. 

I guess that to me it turned out to be a matter of meeting the right person and being 100% open and honest with them. 

Now I try not to label myself so much but I definitely remember the times when I was thinking  ""I'm not supposed to be with anyone"", and it's a devastating feeling. 

I sincerely wish you to find your inner peace soon <3"
