We start paying the Coronavirus Supplement this week. Please pay attention to some information below to understand when you’ll start getting this payment.

You’ll only start receiving this with your fortnightly payment once you’ve reported income for the period that covers 27 April. 
For example, if you’re due to receive your next payment today, the reporting period covers up to 26 April. This means the Coronavirus Supplement won’t be included in this payment cycle. If eligible, we’ll pay the supplement with your next fortnightly payment. 

If you don’t normally report income to receive your payment you don’t need to do anything, you’ll be paid automatically.

If you’re eligible to get the Coronavirus Supplement we’ll continue to pay you the supplement each fortnight for a period of 6 months from 27 April. To get the full supplement each fortnight you must get at least $1 of your payment for that fortnight.

The supplement has started showing in future payments for some people. Don’t worry if you don’t see it in your future payment yet, it will show for everyone progressively.

If you get an eligible payment, you don't need to submit a separate claim or call.

You can find more information here: https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/individuals/services/centrelink/coronavirus-supplement/

This is taken directly from their Facebook page."
