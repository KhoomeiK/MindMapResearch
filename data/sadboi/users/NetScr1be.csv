We can only do what we can.

For decades, Russia officially had no addiction.

The NA message and/or membership got people imprisoned/killed.

Members in Finland risked their lives smuggling Basic Texts into Russia.

In South Korea (and other parts of Asia) addicts were (are?) considered subhuman. I remember hearing an anecdote out of the Pacific Zonal Service Forum about meetings, denied indoor space, met in fields outside of their towns. People still came and threw rocks at them.

Despite all this the message gets out. NA has done nothing but grow.

That's because of unity in following the traditions.

When the newcomers do show up, what are we to show them?  A strong message supported by a well-organized service structure? A hot mess where people write their own rules on the fly? Self-will run riot? HP's will expressed through group conscience?

What you call bureaucracy is group conscience. The traditions serve us well. They are not negotiable.

H&I resources need to be put to the task assigned. This is out of scope for H&I.

As PI chair for the Toronto area we got a request from a shelter that had a pre-rehab program that wanted to add NA to their resources they offered.

As it happens, I didn't have a home group at the time so I started a meeting there that ran for years.

Should _someone_ start a meeting at that shelter? Absolutely.

It has to be done in accordance with the traditions using the appropriate resources.

Us thinking we know better is what got us into NA.

The traditions are based on the experience of our predecessors. Just because we don't understand the reason for them or they don't fit what we want in the moment is no reason to go off on our own.

If everybody did that we don't have a fellowship.

Lastly, personal recovery depends on NA unity. The quality of _your_ recovery depends on all of us working together.

Easiest/cheapest way to make it is fermenting flour.

White flour works but whole wheat is better.

Use a non-reactive container i.e. glass, steel or ceramic. Not aluminum.

Tap water is fine unless it smells of chemicals.

1/4 cup each of flour and water in a bowl. Cover it loosely with a lid or towel an let it sit on the counter. A warmer place will speed up the process.

'Feed' it everyday with one-two tablespoons of flour and water.

A lot instructions recommend throwing away half at every feeding because it expands like crazy.

At day five it should be ready to use.

Test it by seeing if a small portion floats in water.

There may be a slight 'cheesy' smell starting around day four but that is no problem.

Slime or a putrid smell means start over.

This is as safe as it gets as it how yeast was made for millennia until the advent of commercial yeast.

Wild yeast measurements for recipes are kind of a black art. Try a cup or so.

Continue to feed it daily if leaving it out or stick it in the fridge with a weekly feeding (calendar a reminder) to slow it down.

It can be stored long term if dried.

This can be continued indefinitely and you will never use/commercial yeast again.

There is probably a way to calculate an easily-understandable unit of measure like FPS but so many compromises would have to be made to get there it would be essentially meaningless.

Then there is the fact that vision is only one sense and requires the highest processing bandwidth.

It follows that absent other inputs the brain could process visual input faster/better.

Is it possible the cones and rods could respond to the stimulus and the brain 'processes' it but it doesn't register on either level of cons   ciousness in any significant way?

The eye does not 'see'. What we call vision is the brain's interpretation of visual stimuli. The brain will lie if deemed necessary. See [this article]( https://thebrain.mcgill.ca/flash/capsules/experience_bleu06.html) for examples of that.

The problem is that we can't _consciously_ process more than about [120 bits per second](https://www.fastcompany.com/3051417/why-its-so-hard-to-pay-attention-explained-by-science) and there is a lot of overhead dedicated to filtering what gets through from the billions of bits pers per second the sensorium takes in.

Phobia and traumatic memory are not the same thing.

Phobia is a response to an effect (e.g. trauma).

There are multiple methods for making a negative state more positive and, possibly, resolving it.

The method used should only be chosen after calibrating the subject _in that context_. This is where things like preferred representational system and meta-programs come into to play to inform the linguistic patterns and structures to use to attempt change.

Be careful not to invoke the negative state completely but the subject may have to model the submodalities to provide a baseline to know if the chosen method is effective and, if so, by how much.

Modeling may also help to target which submodality to change to get the most benefit.

As mentioned in another comment altering submodalities can have a positive impact.

Another possibility is to copy a positive state from another context and paste it into the target context.

Nothing sticks around like a painful we don't acknowledge and process.

There are no 'good' or 'bad' feelings.

Feelings need no explanation or justification. There is no logic in them. They are, by definition,  irrational - i.e. NOT rational.

There is no why. We feel what we feel and there is no way to control it.

They can be suppressed, or set aside, but that's not the same as feeling them.

Surpressed painful feelings hurt twice. Once on the way in and once on the way out.

Feelings allowed to run their course only hurt once.

Here's an approach for processing them.

Create four internal entities - one for each aspect of being - physical, emotional, mental and energetic (spiritual? whatever fits).

Imagine each entity in turn as an individual being each with its own characteristics. What do they look, sound and/or smell like? How do they carry themselves? More detail is better.

Now sit them all down together in a setting of your choice conducive to them having a dialogue.

There are no rules or judgement. The goal is to help each other.

Since this is about processing feelings, let emotions speak first, without interruptions for as long as necessary.

Give each entity a turn. 

The physical entity will definitely complain about being hungry, thirsty or tired so it is best if these are taken care of before starting.

Not a bad idea to have a separate moderator entity. Take notes if that will help.

Nothing has to be resolved in the moment. If all that happens is each has their say then great. If a positive forward steps can be found so much the better. Maybe it is better to meet each speak their piece and everyone just lets that bake for a while.

I was there once.

Just because you can't see the light from where you are right now doesn't mean it didn't exist. I can assure you it does.

At a high level, what you are saying is you are stuck and not currently capable of moving forward.

This will change. Everything does eventually.

NLP,fn7o1pn,t3_fzxiu2,1586724174.0,"There is no set pattern that works for everyone and/or in every culture.

Also responses may get confused in context.

For instance, during training, a subject was asked a question designed to induce a visual recall response - 'What color was the door on the residence before the one you live in now?'.

His eyes went to visual create.

When asked after, he explained he had build the image because the door was painted while he lived there but he couldn't immediately remember the new colour so started with the original color then 'painted' it in his mind before responding.

For many NLP tools people ask 'But what about a left-handed, Japanese midget with brain damage?'.

The answer is always the same - calibrate your subject and allow for context."

NLP,fn6bq0d,t3_fzux3f,1586694689.0,"I understand your question.

I found it useful during a process to establish a neutral state before shifting into the desired resource state.

State shift is build by my trainer Hugh Comerford (NLPworks.com).

Eventually, neutral became a resource state of its own.

I have ADD so meditation is all but impossible.

I'm working on it using Zhan Zhuang (standing meditation) before doing Chi Gong warmups prior to doing Tai Chi.

Neutral is just momentarily stopping my mind as much as possible and releasing/clearing whatever state I was in.

It's a good opportunity to ground in the here and now because state shift usually entails traveling in time and space. It's important to remember we are actually only modelling the state shift target and not reliving it (especially when calibrating negative/problem states)."
