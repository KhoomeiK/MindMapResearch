People never should think that they are worthless, I know it's not easy but it is the only thing that I am good at, being aware that I am valuable and important as a person even if I don't contribute much to society or other people's happiness, my own feelings and experiences are important enough. 
I hope that it gets better for you, that you will realize your own worth (don't let society and others define what it means to be valuable, money and status, ""contributing to greater goods"" don't matter).
