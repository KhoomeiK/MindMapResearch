I‚Äôm now in a year long relationship and although I‚Äôm finally happy with someone, part of me knows I‚Äôd break inside if I ever saw the light in his eyes die out when he looks at me. Or to know he was like the others and never loved me.

AskWomen,fovhyxv,t1_fovceoo,1588101631.0,"Finding yourself is something that you do, well- by yourself. Whether you‚Äôre in a relationship or not in a relationship is irrelevant to the journey of you becoming your own person. Relationships aren‚Äôt prisons with iron bars and locks, they are a form of support system. Even in relationships, our ability to find ourselves never goes away. 

Our ability to pick up a new hobby, discover something about ourselves, learn new skills, and develop as a person doesn‚Äôt go away. If you choose to ignore those things in favor of a relationship, then that is also a choice you have made on your own. You could replace a relationship with anything else that would distract you from personal growth. If you‚Äôre not looking to do the legwork in finding it, you simply won‚Äôt. 

Our ability to grow is our responsibility and ours alone. A relationship will never erase the work you need to do for yourself in order to grow."

To decide you value whatever more is out there than the woman you chose to be with is such a sad and disappointing thing to hear.

You change greatly year to year from life, and no matter who you get with in the future, you will change drastically from the point you first meet them, to even 5 years down the line, if you guys make it that far. The changing will never end. The needing to work on your relationship to relate to the other person will never change. You‚Äôre not the asshole at ALL for how you feel, but just be aware that our feelings deceive us. Even if you decide to leave him, it‚Äôll happen again in the future.

IAmA,fni4s39,t3_g1vhw6,1586973972.0,Are you proud of the things you‚Äôve decided to do in your life business wise? How do you feel about the way tiger king portrayed you. What is the response you‚Äôve gotten to how you‚Äôre characterized in tiger king? Do you believe at your core that you aren‚Äôt the person people perceive you to be?
TrueOffMyChest,fn8h6wd,t3_fzzovh,1586741563.0,"I've been saying this to people. We try to be more sensitive of other cultures in the western world, so much so, that it becomes detrimental to us. I am in full belief that china is one of the most countries in the world. Their countless human rights violations should be a million dollar project for the U.N, their treatment of their citizens is abhorrent, their internment camps for muslims and their blatant invasion of Africa NEEDS to be talked about. What a fucking joke we are for bending to their will every time they cry wolf."
