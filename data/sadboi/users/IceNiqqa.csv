So a while back I was convinced I was having eczema on my face, so I used my ezcema ointment, triamcinolone, on my face and it cleared right up. I was amazed at how quickly my face dryness cleared up and was a happy camper. I began to use it more and more anytime I suspected my eczema creeping back up on me. Fast forward to now, my face can't seem to look normal without the ointment and I'm not sure what to do. My face looks like a scaly, bumpy nightmare, and I want to know how long until my skin goes back to normal and what I can do to help."
