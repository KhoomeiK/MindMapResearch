Flualp withdrawal are fucking brutal, I quit real alp cold turkey no problem (comparatively).

benzorecovery,fptlv3z,t1_fps0bp4,1588893692.0,"Thank you very much for this informed response.

I’ve been taking them since January 2020 so 4-5 months. I previously quit cold turkey twice after two months use both times and suffered mild withdrawal but I believe I was actually getting prescription Xanax at that point. 

Since January I’ve been a steady plug in my area but I never over-indulged, only 1 quarter S 90 3 in the morning and 1 at night. These are street presses so some are stronger, some are blanks, etc. and it’s most likely flualp or clam (clonozelam (the RC)). One quarter had me sufficiently lubricated, plus I always drink and I always smoke weed on benzos so my days just blur together.

Today I read the manual and took a quarter piece this morning because I realized I did a 50% cut to start and that’s why I felt like the heroin addict from Trainspotting. I plan to follow the Ashton manual but I’m not quite sure where to start.

I believe since flualp and clam have longer half lives I don’t need a mid day dose. I plan to cut a quarter in half for a night time dose to help me sleep and take a quarter in the morning along with exercise, a lot of water, dieting and overall attempting to improve my life as I quit Xanax so a “new me” is synonymous with no benzos, hopefully reinforcing me to really quit.

I think that ups my dose from a 50% cut to a roughly 75% cut. At this point the morning dose literally stops tremors and muscle spasms and intense muscle cramps plus left ear tinnitus. If I could just sleep I can keep my sanity."

After reading the ashton manual this morning I realized my taper schedule was doomed from the beginning. It all started when I took a Percocet and forgot my night time xan dose. I wanted to quit anyway so when the familiar withdrawals started I was like fuck it ride it out until nighttime and take a dose to sleep and suffer through the day.

Makes sense until you read the ashton manual and realized I cut my intake by 50% on a random fucking day (can’t even remember which) on some sketchy bars I that could be up to 1mg Xanax a square (S 90 3s). I’m suffering intensely, can’t sleep, can’t eat, throw up everything, feel like shit. Just overall bad.

Last night I was throwing up so much I took a piece to ease my pain and it was either a bunk bar or my body is really fucked right now because it did nothing for my symptoms, still up chucked everything I ate and slept maybe 2-3 hours.

when we were rolling I was washing clothes (I know but I like to clean when I roll everyone’s different) and I had a ripped shirt I was throwing into the wash  and she snatched it and said my husband doesn’t wear ripped shirts and we kissed and I felt love.

So it was worth it. The perc 15 helped alleviate my come up anxiety and stress because perc 15 is very much like an endless MDMA come up until the happy parts.

I got into some weird places where I missed my ex’s of years ago but that’s probably me feeling guilty subconsciously for being happy with my current girlfriend and somehow feeling like I wasn’t my best self for the other females and that’s why relationships failed.

Also felt guilty for breaking all communications with a girl I dated for four years. It was a bad break up but we literally banded together and escaped terrible lives by scraping everything we had together and moved away from abuse for four years but abuse found its way into our house with our passive aggressiveness because we hadn’t dealt with our parental trauma so one of us wanted to be a free range chicken (gf) and one didn’t understand the coup was open (me).

So revelations, relaxation, sexual healing and gratitude.

Yes, rollercoaster but great trip.
