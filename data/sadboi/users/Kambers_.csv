Irregular periods are also annoying especially when heavy. And my body acne is also annoying and harder to manage but again....more of a ""cosmetic"" symptom as the doctors say. I definitely have my days where my frustration hits peaks and I get upset because I feel it's not fair to have the cystic face/body of a teenager at 26 and it's not fair to have to shave my face everyday as a woman.

 When I was about 20, my body really started to pack on the pounds. I wish I knew it was from PCOS and our insulin issues bc it would have been easier to change my diet back then and maintain my weight instead of trying to lose 100lbs all of the sudden. Some women never get any weight issues, but in my case I had no idea why I was gaining so fast without any change in diet or exercise and now my stomach has the stretch marks of a pregnant woman. But unfortunately I went 6 years before knowing what it was and so that was 6 years of trying different work outs and diets with no results and I eventually just accepted that I would always be fat from then on. So that took a toll mentally. But you know you have it now at such a young age, if you notice weight gain you'll know it's from insulin issues and may be able to control it from the start. 

But in reality, unless you have cysts (not everyone does) and are experiencing lots of pain, PCOS symptoms are more just an annoyance than anything to really worry about. Doesn't sound like you have any of the more severe symptoms, and you may never get them. I started my current symptoms at 16 and didn't get diagnosed until now at 26. And my beard/weight gain hit it's peak around age 20 and hasn't gotten any worse since then. PCOS symptoms vary widely person to person so try not to get too freaked out by this sub."

I'm so jealous, i would much rather have no boobs than these monster boobs that hurt and bras that never fit. I also feel like a hunch back bc I used to try to hide my chest since I got boobs in like the 4th grade. And now they're so big and I have no shoulder/back muscles to support them."

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,f94mju3,t3_e3mahh,1575093586.0,"Aside from their bizarre appearance, someone claiming to be from a company and asking to be let in usually means they are probably going to rob you right then and there, or they're casing your house and will come back when you aren't home or are sleeping to rob you. Happened to a friend's elderly parents. Guy knocks on their door, says they are from a water company and need to check out their water system in the basement bc there was an issue in the neighborhood....old guy lets him in, follows him to the basement. Then the guy tells the old man he needs to bring his wife down with him. Finally old man realizes this is strange and refuses. Guy runs up and out the front door and hops into a running car and drives off. Basically the guy wanted to get the couple into the basement so he could lock them down there while he robbed the place. Anyway, ive had way too many people like this show up at my door growing up. I no longer answer the door when the door bell rings, I just hide lol."

She just happened to have a small chin and a fat pocket there due to genetics. She did 2 rounds of cool sculpting and recorded the experience (really uncomfortable and painful looking) but the little bit of fat there totally disappeared! Pretty cool science behind it.

KidneyStones,f8hn171,t3_e0s8zt,1574577116.0,"My worse stone caused 3-4 months of the worst shooting pain from my ureter to my clit. Came in waves every 5 minutes or so. That's a frickin sensitive area to begin with but it must have been stuck pinching some nerve when the ureter spasmed. I could barely sleep for months it hurt so bad. On top of maxing out Motrin and Tylenol dosages 3 times a day I would take sleep aids to force myself to sleep at night so I could go to work and ""function"". I called my doctor bawling from the pain and all they could do was tell me to keep taking my Tylenol bc theres nothing else they can do or prescribe for stones. It wasn't a huge stone, only 4-5mm, but if they get stuck in the right place it's hell."

What is your company culture like?

Is the company growing or do you predict it to grow in the near future?

I really value communication (or other aspect) within a company, could you give me examples of how you achieve that? Do you hold weekly/monthly meetings?

What would make a candidate successful in this role?

How do you evaluate your employees' performances? How often do you conduct employee reviews?

What would you want to see me accomplish/find most critical in the first 3-6 months?

Are there growth opportunities? What is the path for someone in this role? How long does it take to move along that path?


Will there be training for this position and with who?

What is your favorite aspect of working for this company?"

I'm here too and although I'm currently in a crowded city, my parents live out in a middle of no where town in the middle of the woods. Nothing paranormal has happened to us there though. Except one time my phone started playing some random ringtone that had never been set in my phone out of no where with no notifications. It was while we were touring the current house they live in back when I was a kid, I think it was the original Razor phone lol. And my grandpa said he heard someone talking in our house when no one was talking, but he was also old. Nothing too exciting"

acting,f83uvma,t3_dysaah,1574221592.0,Stagecrafters Theater in Chestnut Hill and Quintessence Theatre Group in Mt Airy are both Philly theaters in very LGBT friendly neighborhoods.

mentalhealth,f83shsw,t3_dykram,1574219751.0,"Yuuuup. I'm a female. Absolutely no sex drive when on SSRIs, and also super sleepy all the time. I can't take anything else bc of my anxiety. But without it I'm a mess. And before meds I had a really high sex drive due to having PCOS (fucked up ovaries producing extra testosterone). 

Unfortunately, there's not much you can do about it bc the benefits of not killing yourself outweigh no sex drive and tiredness.

Edit: Also am losing my significant other of 8years due to no sex drive. I can't force myself to fake it like my one doctor suggested. I can't remember the last time we had sex. If I get drunk enough, which is rare, I can sometimes do it but it's only been a couple times a year. .Just over all a shitty situation."
