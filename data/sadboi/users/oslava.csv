chlorpheniramine,fr555yb,t1_fr4yo6m,1589902688.0,"Id try 1 Dose (6 4mg tablets) first, I did 1.5 on my first time but it wasnt really a nice buzz, it was like, “oh hey! yeah.. im super high”. The dreams occur more frequently if you take Chlorpheniramine near the hours you usually sleep at, however they have occurred to me 1-2 days after dosing but only one dream.

Speaking of dreams, they seem to be very surreal. In every dream I had with chlorpheniramine so far I couldn’t control what was happening, like the dream had a mind of its own in the sense that you don’t control the effects of chlorpheniramine, it controls you. Its a tad bit confusing for novel drug users, so heres an example:

You dose 3 doses of chlorpheniramine, you feel the serotonin flow through your mind and body and your depression is now nonexistent. Music becomes a teacher, every word becomes a lecture for you (all real effects on 3 doses of chlorpheniramine btw) then you feel the drug slowly make you sleepy so you turn off the music and now the dream begins. Keep in mind here you just fade into a dream state where the dreams are fast paced but you can understand everything and also the following dream scenario happened on my third chlorpheniramine experience: A scenario appears, a familiar place... its almost like you’ve been here before, you are of a different gender, you are of a different race and you’re at a store. You don’t control the dream or have any input into it, its like the dream is a live-stream video or a deep memory, your name appears on the checkout, L Magareth, the cashier smiles and she hands you back your credit card, a woman that appears to be your mother speaks, “you can use our name” she says while smiling and a man who appears to be your father smiles aswell, you look off into the distance from a third person view of your face and then the dream fades and you wake up in absolute awe. You know what you are but for now your stuck in this earth realm. Now questions still linger but thats no worry, your at peace. The afterglow is calming and some people feel creative after dosing chlorpheniramine.

TLDR: Dreams on chlorpheniramine = destroying the firewall on our “reality”"

I do not regret trying it and actually I would like to take more for the creative boost I get after on it.

I have also made a theory: a tab of acid and Chlorpheniramine. Would they work well with eachother? I may test this out soon but I first need to confirm that they dont have negative interactions, which is really impossible since few people have done chlorpheniramine high dose on purpose.

I had the music going and all the songs had a meaning that I could point out to myself, the cev are there sometimes for me. I had major introspective thoughts and I always had that “fuzzy” feeling when I woke up afterwards. However it usually only last a day, the afterglow is very prevalent like 1-3 days after.

chlorpheniramine,fpmgak4,t3_ge92w4,1588732442.0,"#**Creator of the sub here to clarify some things:**

      Yes Chlorpheniramine can be toxic (physically) but only in extremely high doses. Ever hear of Triple C’s? Well those have DXM and Chlorpheniramine, which are both processed simultaneously by the liver, which in higher doses can be deadly.

      Personally I’ve done it 4 times and every single time was a blast! I had a somewhat clear headspace and I was having some minor internal hallucinations (thinking of settings and plots, introspective thoughts) and a profound experience with music. Afterwards I’d usually have a vivid dream where I could understand everything and remember it after. The comedown when you wake up (if you’ve taken a big dose in for the first time in two weeks) feels like an opioid high as your body is so relaxed. Chlorpheniramine is not an addictive chem, and its rather hard to abuse frequent as the drug has a few days tolerance (3-4 days).

[.     Please make sure you use a drug interaction checker before dosing](https://www.drugs.com/drug-interactions/chlorpheniramine-index.html)
as Chlorpheniramine has SSRI-like effects and taking it with any substance with similar effects could lead to Serotonin syndrome or death (DXM is an example).

      However Chlorpheniramine on its own is safe in the recommended dosages. A dose higher than 3 (18 4mg tablets) is incredibly sedating and might put you to sleep fairly quickly. With anything higher than 3 doses you will most likely not experience anything awake and you will only experience something when the Chlorpheniramine kicks in and you go to sleep (vivid dreams).

      Maximum daily dosage is no more than 60mg, and thats spacing it apart. No one here has/or has posted that they have taken 60mg or more at once."

Drugs,fopzieq,t3_g8r43i,1587977502.0,"Hmm not old enough yet, but all throughout my life I felt different and useless. I acted strange when I was younger and was a tad bit antisocial. So i said fuck it August 10th, 2019 when my cousin offered me acid. Holy fuck everything became so shitty as I could see the world for what it was but electronic music became so fucking powerful, like a freedom and joy I felt I had never experienced before. I returned to my native country and started my last year at school. I picked shit classes and I was going to fail (quarantine is saving me rn) i just isolated from everyone and my friend/close-group that rapped/music whatever and my parents destroyed my confidence. They ruined it and then I was rejected by a girl I liked, fuck I lost it (I wanted to trip with her aswell but she didnt want to). An edible in school with puking and missing the rest of the day later, a friend hits me up, same one that helped me through the weed puking at school says he wants to buy acid, we pull up at my house at 12 and buy 2 tabs from a mobile plug.

I think I had a great trip but something was missing, it didnt fill the void I feel now. I woke up panicked a day or two after the trip and hallucinated someone or something had knocked the window. Dad hit me with a flashlight somewhat violently and it was horrible. A month goes by and i eat some Isomoera Purpurea Seeds (LSA/MORNING GLORY) with vigor. I was dead, and I had been rebooted temporarily, i was puking hard (removing negatives from my soul) and i feel asleep fully clothed on my bed (even shoes). Mom opens door and says i miss bus, she makes nothing of this and makes a sandwich and I call taxi and drink ginger soda for the horrible pain i felt in my stomach , taxi takes a while. I talk with taxi driver the whole way and the music he was playing was soothing (Journey- The Train song, dont stop believing) and wow i never heard it like that before! I get off and talk with everyone i knew (close obviously) and thats it. Before the LSA trip I wanted to make some sort of “weed enhancer” with the extra 10,000 seeds i had, i only ate 600 or so and gave 600 or so to the friend i tripped acid with a month earlier and I returned the rest as I saw them as a medicine one should only do once in their lives. Made some crazy music after a LSA all inspired from the trip where I saw myself as a “small” and I was vulnerable. I was fine for a while, I did Amanitas twice and did some stupid shit (but I felt more alive and pure) that kind of fucked me over for a while. The whole world became bleak and boring. I discovered r/chlorpheniramine and it was a fucking blast, lucid dreams and music felt live and I understood each and every song’s message, I felt so calm after each trip. Now in quarantine I am questioning everything on my fourth or fifth (ive lost count) trip of Tramadol. I like it, and theres a lot of it around but I wont do a lot, think of it as my weed of sorts. Parents are trying to control themselves but sometimes one of them explodes or both and im the target sometimes. My body aches from all the work they have me doing, digging, moving sand, cutting treess and moving heavy shit in the yard. We only stop when it rains or when i have homework and I just bullshit the day so i dont have to fucking kill my body and be exposed to the cold. Today my dad threw a fucking metal weight or something and almost destroyed my middle left arm because i told him I am fucking tired and want to relax (imagine how chill my life could be if I could just, fuck). My body hurts so much and the Tramadol is distracting me. Each and every week gets more suicidal and depressing. Also a source of my parents anger could be not receiving the fucking stimulus check money/unemployment benefits.

TL;DR: I hate everything rn and I hope not to die, sending good vibes for all those like me rn, bless!"

It doesn’t look terribly bad as it has some stimulant-like effects but in the recommended dose is 60 mg per 24 hrs (you will be taking 24 mg Chlorpheniramine, that would be 60 mg of phenylephrine total) so you should be ok here. Worse possible, hypertension and or slow heart beat if you are predisposed to these conditions (diabetes or something similar). If there are any positives it seems that the phenylephrine will counteract the sedative effect if chlorpheniramine that puts you to sleep, therefore giving you more energy and a longer experience. As I’ve on my other posts on this sub, chlorpheniramine is great in any mood your having, depressive, happy, etc. You should be okay friend, dont do anything higher than 6 4 mg chlorpheniramine of this specific brand if you feel it to be too much, go up by half a dose until you find the sweet spot."
chlorpheniramine,fogutj9,t1_foglb8e,1587757223.0,"Nice! Sounds like a nice time. Anything high like a 3 Dose, will limit your mobility to a degree where you will have to think about some actions (getting out of bed, generally physical activities that require lots of work and patience) for a few seconds before you can do it. But what I’ve noticed is that the Chlorpheniramine sort of guides what you want in that moment, similar to an introspective drug/medicine. Chlorpheniramine is more for relaxing and enjoying life and music, doing creative things is nice during a trip but its not recommended as you mind become bored, afterwards creativity is huge! I made a few songs after a trip haha. If you dont have heart issues (yourself or your family) , are prone to addiction, or are on any medication (illegal or legal variety) Id recommend checking out Tramadol, it’s similar to Chlorpheniramine but its Vivid Dreams are more intense, you get hugely motivated to do any hobbies or work (not physically like landscape or working out as you may die as a result of increased heartbeat), listening to music is incredible aswell, and it seems to be more Introspective than Chlorpheniramine. Use a  small dropper and try 10 drops with your favorited beverage (no alcohol you will die) and work you way up to around 30 max, enjoy Friend!"

Blah blah, “no senor” we all said, meaning No sir or in this case get a load at this guy (in my mind). Driving through the street, nothing, dude even had the radio on, dry asf. Taxi makes to the house we were staying at, its no big deal I make it up the stairs, no visuals here either. Close the door and say goodnight to grandma and her sister. Put studio headset on, dababy starts playing, I say “naw this is wack lets try some earbuds and electronic music. My song ‘Space’ (Andreas Von Dyvor) sends me full fledge into the trip. From here Afterwards I did Acid again, tried lsa (fuck that but i learned sum things about myself, some amanita mushrooms, chlorpheniramine (L463 variant) and Tramadol (this one is kinda sick and gets me in a creative mood on and afterwards)."
