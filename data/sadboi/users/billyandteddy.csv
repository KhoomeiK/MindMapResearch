We're taught that after high school, we are supposed to go to college so we can get a good job to afford everything in life. And then there is this stigma that I feel exists, of if you are in your 20s and still living at home with your parents then you are failure, or at least looked down upon, because your not trying to go out and be ""successful"". It's really hard, especially financially in America, to live on your own at 20-something. I know that there are cultures in other countries, when kids live with parents, as adults, until they get married, or even after that. I wish that pressure and sigma didn't exist, because I constantly feel like a failure because I can't live up to being an independent adult yet (and idk when I will be, if ever)."

Episode,fpqmyvu,t3_gey2c6,1588826672.0,"So, basically the MC, Shelley, was orphaned where she was like 14 (I think), so she and her brother have to move in with their aunt and uncle in another city. And when she starts college, she moves back to the town she grew up in, so she can run into her childhood best friend and long time crush, Matthew. At first it's a lot of college drama, relationship drama, family drama, but slowly magic and fantasy elements are introduced and plot begins to build up. It was really good at first, like I couldn't stop reading and got the first 90 episodes (which aren't short) in like a week or less. The story hits climax around episode 115-120ish. In 121, it got to the point where everything was building up to, and in the middle of this big plot point climax, all of a sudden (I may have picked the alternate ending) Shelley dies and it fast forwards like 20 yrs and it really got lame it said: ""The End"". And then the author released more episodes, so in 122, it got really confusing because it seemed like almost everything that happened in the episode before was disregarded, because the time jump was gone, Shelley was alive and the plot remained unresolved.  It was just so terrible and confusing I couldn't read anymore, even though I originally loved the story."

Then there is the magic, which either really lame and never explained or super complicated to point I can't understand how it works. (And why does there always gotta be magic?) And I like the idea of a story taking place on a place other than earth, but it seems all the worlds in the fantasy books I read, are like basically the same. There is little technology, and I get these medieval to 18th century vibes. They just all seem to have these old fashioned notions, society and cultures that are very similar and I can easily tell where the concept came from in earth history/culture. Like, I expect for if a story is taking place on a whole different world, to have a completely different, unique culture and society, but they don't seem to.

So then I literally reached a point of my live when had no friends and I got super lonely and depressed. It was then I realized it was better for my mental health for me to have a friend and be anxious about it then be completely alone. And it took time to reach out and reconnect with old friends (I still can't make new ones) but now we can text and talk on the phone occasionally (no video calls for us). I still get anxious when I text and talk but I realize I value my friendships more and don't ever want to feel completely alone again (because that's honestly worse) so I push through my anxiety. And I know my friends understand I have anxiety and it's ok if I don't want to talk. 

It can be helpful to set a time to phone call and let your friends know you have anxiety, so you won't always respond right away. A therapist can help teach you coping skills to combat your anxiety, like breathing/relaxation/meditation.

Watercolor,fnb0fgj,t3_g0lteo,1586807050.0,"Equipment:

* watercolor paper (inexpensive is fine to start with; the thicker the paper, the more water it'll hold; hot press paper is smooth and cold press has some texture, both work well it just depends on whether or not you like texture to your paper)
* watercolor brushes (soft; these should be made of hair or synthetic hair that feels pretty real)
* watercolor tubes of paint (usually not too expensive, works well and easy to mix for beginners)
* paint palette (plastic or I just use a styrofoam plate, that way when the paint dries, you can just add water and use them again) 
* water
* paper towels"
