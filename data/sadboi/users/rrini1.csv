We have had many discussions on this subreddit about the amount of unpaid labour and emotional labour is carried out by homemakers. You have contributed so much of your life, effort and your strength to keeping the home running, raising your children, keeping the house livable etc. Please never forget that.   


I am no stranger to gaslighting, so I hope you are able to fix it in your head that this is not your fault. Sending all the love and support your way OP"

SuicideWatch,f86o8ex,t3_dz9w45,1574302973.0,"I'm glad that you reached out. You get to control your actions and your response. Your are not responsible for what she says or does. 

Sometimes it takes a little bit of time for parents to come around because they don't want to believe it. It took my mom almost 8 months, but finally she allowed a psychiatrist visit.

Anyway, you deserve care and respect. You chose to fight for yourself today and advocate for your own health and that needs respect. I am proud of you and you should be proud of yourself."
depression_help,f82tjoq,t3_dynl3z,1574197931.0,"I'm sorry that happened to you. It's not fair of your friend, and I don't know much about your friends or your relationships with them, but it's not a good feeling to feel like you cannot talk about how you're feeling, and have your efforts reciprocated. 

&#x200B;

I feel like that all the time, in terms of being productive and then falling into a rut. I found it helpful to try to use the times that I'm feeling productive to set myself up to cope with the times when I am not doing well. It doesn't necessarily have to be to talk to my friends about how I'm feeling. I know from being on the other side of it that it *is* emotionally taxing to be supportive towards someone. Maybe make some commitments that you need to follow through, like go out for a dinner, set up a work meeting, commit to working out with a friend etc. That way you're held accountable, and though you are sad, you are still being productive to ride it through. 

Like the other commenter said, I think it is also helpful to figure out why this cyclical thing is happening. You may need to be critical and think about things that you've been trying to avoid. (I always do this.) It sucks, but I've learned that not many people will always be there for you at all time, and then it's up to ourselves to do what we need to pull through."

Though... not sure if it was the exercise or the sleep"

dating_advice,f5ufn0j,t3_dp61cj,1572472523.0,"Got rejected recently. I did what I thought was best and played it cool and accepted gracefully. We both have gotten to be better friends over the past 2 months and I was afraid that it would be screwed up, but I think both of us were determined to be mature and not make it awkward.

I still have feelings, and feel sad sometimes about why the feelings weren't reciprocated, but I am very careful to only share those feelings with my journal (and now Reddit). Hopefully I can get past these feelings soon and can enjoy the friendship fully"

relationship_advice,exdks0b,t1_exdki6i,1566179315.0,"I totally get that feeling. You need to make some rules for yourself to help you not keep thinking about her. Maybe think about taking time off the streak and restarting in a bit? If that’s too extreme, then get it out of the way first thing in the morning and then you have the rest of the day to live your life. 

Either way this sends a message not just to yourself but also to her about the future of your relationship going forward."

Depending on how long it's been, you could get a Plan B, or if it has been a while, think about a pregnancy test. Also, if you don't fully know or trust the person, it would be best to get a STD screening. Might be a good idea either way. Good luck!"
askwomenadvice,etjmp0p,t1_etjf8oo,1562876849.0,"I'm crying, both from OP's post and from this comment. It has given me a lot to think about as I think it is a major thing I struggle with. 

I find though that I err on the side of asking for too much feedback. Right now, I am on a solo trip and usually I really enjoy these but this past year has been so much anxiety for me, that all I can think of are my friends back home and how they are hanging out without me and about to realize that it's more fun without me anyway. Then I start casually striking up a conversation for them not forget me and then get upset if they don't reply right away. Of course they love me and they do say that, and of course they are not going to be constantly checking their phones if they are doing an activity. I just have to reason it all out in my head before I get way too needy and insecure in my relationships."
