When i was on Heroin i NEVER got sick (caught a cold). Now on Methadone Maintenance i get bad sinus infections & Bronchitis (never smoked) twice a year"
Methadone,fmaarty,t3_ftqrsp,1585888373.0,"Definitely ask to sit there for 15 minutes, like the other comments mention if your sick there you can get another dose. Its lame but try slatines or my favorite is pretzels, the salt is very helpful for nausea."
Methadone,fmaac16,t3_ftvx72,1585888021.0,"PLEASE let me know how you make out.
I am so tired of being on the program & my clinic isnthe same way, wait 2 hours to see the doctor, like they are scared you will get off & they will lose the business.

I am on 130mg & get 27 take homes
I have been taking 1 today ½ tomorrow 1 the next then ½ (basically full dose then half every other day)
They add water to it so its impossible to get a real accurate idea of how much i have.

I was thinking maybe take a few sips as i feel needed but your mind can really mess with you, make you feel sick when ur not. If i sneeze twice i swear i am in withdrawal (even if i just took a full dose)

Please keep me posted, i dont have weed but i have xanax & promethazine (i like to keep meds, just in case)"
Methadone,fma9egp,t3_ftw97r,1585887284.0,"My clinic only gives 24 to 48 hours  notice, 2 weeks is odd but maybe because of this COVID-19 maybe they are making changes & its not exactly  a call back just a pick up a day early heads up.

My clinic allows you to dose at home the day of call backs. If you go in on Thursday, you can take Thursdays dose at home but you better have Fridays & a bottle for everyday thereafter"
Methadone,fma7h0c,t1_fm9k4ke,1585885806.0,"My clinic does not make you bring in your dose.
You can take that days dose at home but you better have all the other bottles & you have to take them in order of the date printed on the bottle (if everyday isnthe same dose why does it matter)?"
Methadone,fma75zo,t3_ftx813,1585885573.0,"I had a friend who was prescribed methadone pills by a regular doctor (he also had sever pain so it was prescribe as a medication for pain not drug maintenance, even though it was drug maintenance)
BUT that is cery difficult to do. I wouldnt move unless all that is straightened out"
Methadone,fma6tr1,t1_fm81lmy,1585885320.0,"I would NEVER risk sobriety for ANYONE
That is the most important thing in your life.
Im on 130mg i am able to drink a full dose 1 day then the next day a half. So half every other day. (I always feel like i have to have back up just incase it hits the fan)
That is an option to help but when would it stop.

This is the reason why clinics are so tuff & its frustrating that people do the right thing are penalized"
Methadone,fma5qs1,t1_fkrclu5,1585884518.0,"I know i am in fear of telling news or anyone else  about the problems at my clinic.
My fear is...if they knownits me i will be treated worse & most importantly, what if they close down the clinic? Then i have to find another, lose all my take homes & probably have to drive 30 minutes one way to find another"
AmItheAsshole,fm806pq,t3_ftd115,1585840282.0,"Just a thought....
The only they will leave is IF you find them a place
First thing I would do is Public assistance, look into getting them public assistance, I don't know what country or state you are in but a lot of places offer rental assistance (government pays your rent). 

I don't blame you for wanting them out but they won't do the work & they wont leave unless you GIVE them another option"
AmItheAsshole,fm7zpji,t1_fm6uvkz,1585840014.0,"They will be there FOREVER 
No landlord will rent to them, whonwould rent to 2 unemployed people?
The only option is public assistance"
AmItheAsshole,fm7z68u,t3_ftd115,1585839708.0,"Everyone is an A$$
No offense but what did you think would happen when you moved in her boyfriend? 
They caught the disease ""entitlement"". We cant work, what do you expect us to do, so you have to support us.
What if they decide to have another kid next year?
Why not move in with his parents? Because they don't want to support 3 maybe eventually more people.

The only help they will accept is the free ride they are getting now.
They will never find a place, who will rent to 2 unemployed people? Most places won't talk to you unless you have 6 to 12 months paid in advanced 

Good luck"

Methadone,fm4dnl6,t1_fm3vptw,1585752061.0,"Hi 
It sounds like you may need an increase.
How much are you on?
I did about a bundle a day (10 bags) 
I havent used 12 years 
I admit it took a while but i got there
I am on 130mg & the only medication i take is the methadone. I hear there are some medications that may weaken the dose.

When do you get these feelings/urges? (Right after or hours later?)
Do you have take homes?
Maybe try half in the morning & half afew hours later"

My place just ASKS about HIV (obviously people can lie)
And requires a yearly TB test

I am off all drugs, no prescriptions, other than the methadone & no health issues (other than addiction)
I go ever 27 days & i have to do a monitored urine to show i am clean.
I pay $260 a month."
Methadone,fm4brsm,t3_fsy16s,1585750977.0,"I never ever caught a cold while on heroin, never sick (only the kind that can be cured with drugs)
Once i got on meth i get sick twice a year like clockwork. 
There are MANY days where i feel...not right & it i sneeze twice in a row, well that is automatically withdrawal & my mind convinces me & the other symptoms come flooding in. Once i get busy it all goes away."
Methadone,fm4abxl,t3_fsygq0,1585750115.0,"Some people are scared to complain to the authorities, if my clinic is shut down the next 1 is about 30 minutes away, it may even be worse."
