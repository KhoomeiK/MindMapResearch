I haven't got there yet but I even change the times on my fasting app. Pretend you ate and keep going. If you have weight to lose, there's a good chance your hunger is psychological. Have you read The Obesity Code by Dr Jason Fung? It's illuminating.

Fasting makes weightloss easy for me. He can have a large meal and be less strict with his diet. The Obesity Code by Dr Jason Fung and Delay Don't Deny by Gin Stephens helped me a lot. They're on audible too.

When I met my ex he had lost 50kg, he was 100kg. We had a wonderful relationship and he is hands down the most interesting, hilarious person I know. He ended up gaining the 50kg back and then some. My point is, all you can do is encourage someone. It's not your job to hold their hand and guide them through. I was stupid and adopted his garbage food habits, never again."
