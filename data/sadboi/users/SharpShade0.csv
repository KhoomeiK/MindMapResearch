SuicideWatch,ey7wua8,t3_cvqe85,1566904028.0,"When I was in my teenage years I did some impressive writing. Looking back at the writing  blew me away at what thoughts and Revelations young me was having at the time. today in my mid-20s, I've had countless Manic and depressive episodes. I've channeled my bipolar disorder on stage as an actor. However, there has been a steep cost to the intense ups and downs. I struggle to write as well. I used to be able to just read something and absorb the information and lock it in. Right now it feels like I struggle to piece things together and my thoughts aren't as clear and it is frustrating. I feel so distant. I am a different person than I was just five years ago. I went from taking a full load of courses in college being engaged in extracurricular activities while having two part-time jobs and now I struggle just to complete 4 credits in College. I'm taking Lithium which I'd imagine has helped but not enough."
