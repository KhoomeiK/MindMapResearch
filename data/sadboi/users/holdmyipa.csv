datingoverthirty,fke3e7r,t1_fkc4q7t,1584104116.0,"No, we don't work for the same company. I'm also young looking and in shape, everyone is surprised when I tell them my age... He's talking about a potential relationship which looks great on him but I still worry that I'll be judged, but yes, very into him... Who knows, it could also just fizzle out after I give him the business, which usually happens. How did his parents treat you at first?"
datingoverthirty,fkbl8d8,t1_fkau79q,1584035063.0,"Thanks so much for your input. I guess I just fear the judgement that I would receive from being the older one. He's pretty financially stable and has the same type of job that I do (administrative in a medical practice), not sure how he is with cooking and laundry, but I'm not great with those either... But socially, we're on the same page. We like trivia and breweries, movies, etc. As far as the weed thing goes, we were both pot heads before we met so we have that in common. 
Did you all live together or meet each others families since you were together for 5 years? Do you typically go for younger men or did you guys just click?"

BPD,fiubsiq,t3_f9ufwz,1582738513.0,"Big mood and youâ€™re not alone. Everyone in my life is in a relationship, except me. I feel completely worthless and unlovable, Iâ€™ve never been in a relationship for longer than a few months and Iâ€™m 31 years old. Iâ€™m always good enough to fuck but never to be called a girlfriend. This, along with finding my dad dead a few months ago, has led me into a deep pit of despair and depression and has me cutting and having suicidal ideations."

insomnia,fitmnbj,t3_f9g2qn,1582724384.0,"I have a similar issue when I go to bed at 10-11pm (have to wake up at 6:45 for work)... recently I've been so depressed that I take benadryl and get into bed as soon as I get home (around 5pm-ish) and am asleep by 7-8pm. Instead of the 3:30am drill, I've been waking up at 1-1:30ish and toss and turn until my alarm goes off. I would chalk mine up to stress, anxiety and depression."
