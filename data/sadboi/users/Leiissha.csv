BipolarReddit,f6l8a4k,t3_drowhs,1572932490.0,"I'm on 150mg daily and I love it. It helps me sleep which is especially beneficial when I'm manic. I feel good taking it. I started on a low dose and ended up at 150mg. I gained weight from it but as long as you keep an eye on it you'll be okay.

Edit: This is the most stable I've felt in years. So hopefully it does the same for you!"
