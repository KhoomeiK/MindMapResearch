therapy,ffi8gjw,t3_etp0fz,1579967795.0,"A therapist is anyone providing therapy to a client.  A social worker concentrates in either macro work, where they are involved in policy and non-profit work, or clinical (LCSW, LiCSW) which enables them to provide therapy.  Essentially therapy is the service and social work is one of the degrees and licensure that allows you to provide it. 

A nurse who can write prescriptions is usually an advance practice nurse practitioner who is trained to prescribe medications.  They will talk to you about the issues that you are going through to determine the best meds for you and will follow up to see how effective they are.  That part can be similar to therapy."
psychotherapy,fffdva7,t3_et1mlw,1579881796.0,"Going by the percentage cut between the therapist and the practice overly simplifies the equation.  You have to ask what their average reimbursement rate is.  In our area, some practices will get $60/hr from an insurance company and others $140/hr.  Obviously, 55% of $140 ($77) is better than 80% of $60 ($48).  Practices that can negotiate a higher rate also tend to offer more services and have higher overhead.

You also have to look at what you are getting for the cut the practice keeps.  Is there paid time off? Do they pay for your CEUs (including travel)? Do they invest enough in marketing to give you as many clients as you want? Do they pay you for everyone you see in a particular time period or do they way wait until the insurance reimbursement comes in?  Are they on-top of the billing so that they make sure the reimbursements all come in?  Do you have a comfortable office?  All that is overhead that costs money.

Make sure you get a full picture of what you are getting for your work."

therapy,fd2g8p0,t3_ejwa83,1578146773.0,"Absolutely.  Therapists have different styles and it is important to find one that clicks with you. That is why most write bios on their practice websites and/or Psychology Today.  For example, some people may be looking for a therapist who is directive, but other may find this off-putting. 

You should ask if they take your insurance.  You want to know in advance how much it will cost. At our practice we check the client's benefits before the first appointment to see if they have a deductible and how much the co-pay will be, though most don't do this.  

You will want to call your insurance company as well to ensure that you are covered.  There are times when the behavioral health portion of the insurance is ""carved out"" to another insurance company.  For instance, we have had clients who have Blue Cross, which we do accept, but their behavioral health is actually handled by Optum, which we do not take.  The clients rarely know when medical and behavioral are under different insurers."

By the fall of the city to the Turks, they would have considered the empire to be 2,206 years old.

I would be guessing, but I would think that family members could have someone deemed to be incapable of administering their financial affairs. The extended family was very intertwined legally and financially and debt could easily lead to debtor prisons or slavery.  This could have been a protection for the rest of the family from an out of control spender running the finances into the ground.

EDIT: I looked around a bit and there is a belief that Romans saw one would only become a ""spendthrift"" due to a mental illness and thus lumped it in with the other mental problems.

AskHistorians,f9us87x,t3_e6y4jr,1575656772.0,"It would likely depend on he family and the economic situation.  The father had the right of life and death over a child. If an infant was born with an obvious abnormality, it could be left exposed to the elements to either die or be taken in as a slave by another family.  As far are Roman law went, it seems to have concerned itself more with the practical aspects of he mental illness. If someone had property, but was deemed not capable to administer it, a curator, usually another family member could be appointed.

""If a person shall be insane, authority over him and his property shall belong to his male agnates \[relatives in the male line\] and in default of these to his male clansmen. Administration of his own goods shall be forbidden to a spendthrift. . . . A spendthrift, who shall be forbidden from administering his own goods shall be . . . under the guardianship of his male agnates."" (Coleman- Norton, 1950, p. 12) 

The Justinian Codex also seems to indicate that someone could be deemed unable to enter into legal contracts or in some cases would not be held responsible for their actions, as if they were a child.

Of course most of what has survived only refers to the upper classes.  Famously, people thought Claudius had a mental disability, but it appears it may have been a ruse to seem to not be a threat to Caligula who murdered any other family member who had a line to the throne.

As for whether people were compassionate to those with a disability, I have not come across anything indicating one way or another. I would be interested to hear if anyone else has.

ancienthistory,f9q40vt,t1_f9q1ovv,1575554769.0,"Once you get to stuff that is a bit more academic, I would highly recommend From the Gracchi to Nero by Scullard. It is an excellent review of the late republican period as it transitions to empire. I agree with Livy and Herodotus, they can just be a bit daunting at first.  While we are getting into ancient sources, I am partial to Polybius.  Xenophon's Anabasis is also a classic adventure of 10,000 Greek mercenaries trying to make their way out hostile Persian territory. 

While you mention Greece and Rome, don't forget about the Hellenized period of Alexander the Great and his successors. It is the period that fills the gap between Greece and Rome at their peaks.  There is lots of drama between his generals and their successors as they battle for control of his empire.  Peter Green's From Alexander to Actium is great, though again, fairly daunting at nearly a thousand pages."
ancienthistory,f9py4pk,t3_e6gkv5,1575551500.0,"I would start with an overview of the period. For Rome and Greece, you will probably have to choose Greece, Republican Rome, or Imperial Rome.  Pick something not very academic to get a feel for the periods that interest you the most. You can do a deep dive once you find your area of interest.  Michael Grant and Mike Duncan have some good books that cover a large timespan.

Most books tend to be about very specific events, people or time periods.  Just make sure you start with authors that are easy to read. I'm partial to Adrian Goldsworthy and Anthony Everett for this type of book.  I'm currently reading Lost to the West about the Byzantine Empire by Lars Brownworth. I've finding it an enjoyable read. It is outside my area of specialty (late republic) so it is a good survey.

If you really get into one specific time period or person, then  get into the more academic stuff.

therapy,f57j4g7,t1_f57fa0l,1572037044.0,"I would call a larger practice that has multiple therapists.  They will usually have someone dedicated to answering calls and scheduling appointments.  You are more likely to get through to someone on your lunch break and actually speak to someone. 

There are a couple things that could be going on (in my opinion). First, I have found that individual therapists are not always great at getting back to people. I co-own a practice, running the business side, and take the intake calls. I have heard way too many people say that they can't get anyone to call them back.  Our area has a shortage of therapists, so many have wait lists and only call back when they have spots they want to fill. I personally don't find that acceptable, the client always deserves a call back, but that is me. Some therapists say that they just get too many calls to return them all.

A couple things to keep in mind that may influence the call backs. First, insurance companies reimburse at different rates. It is possible that they are prioritizing people with insurance that pays better. Not cool, but I can see it happening. Second, it could be that they are not completely comfortable with issues that you want to address. There are many specialties and trainings for dealing with different issues. They may not feel they have enough knowledge to help with your specific issue.  This is still no excuse for not calling you back. We regularly refer people to other practices that work with issues we don't.

Psychology Today's website is always a useful tool for finding therapists.  They have a search engine on their homepage and you can narrow the results using various filters.

Also, check your spam folder.  I have had many times when I have offered times to clients and don't hear back from them.  When I call them, they simply didn't see the email.

## Severity: High

This attack could pose a serious security threat. You should take immediate action to stop any damage or prevent further damage from happening.

## Description

This signature detects hidden scripts injected in compromised websites, which upon visiting redirects the user to malicious websites.

## Additional Information

This is a detection for compromised websites with the injected script code. This is an attack where a malicious javascript is injected in large number of clean websites. Once compromised, it aims to use the websites to redirect its visitors to malicious websites without visitors being aware of it. The malicious javascript can also perform other unwanted activities like stealing payment information from payment pages on ecommerce websites.
