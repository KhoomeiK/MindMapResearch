inuyasha,fnhpzbt,t3_fyatcc,1586966831.0,"Just started the final act (I've always watched dub version) first thing that threw me off was the change of voice actors for Kagome and Sesshomaru. Then I was so happy to see Koga back! The story did feel pretty rushed, Hakudoshi died too fast. He was my favorite villain, and I would have liked to see him go on a bit further."

Hair,fclty69,t3_ehlizr,1577756391.0,"That color is gorgeous and a shame to have to say goodbye to! ðŸ˜©

You'll want to remove the direct dye before using a permanent color. Otherwise the dye will be driven deep into the cortex of the hair and become difficult to manage in the future. 

You need a specific direct dye remover such as;
 pulp riot blank canvas or joico eraser.

Then if you're left with a platinum blonde you will want to fill with a cool tone 7 if you intend on going darker than a level 5 or 6. 

Good luck!"
