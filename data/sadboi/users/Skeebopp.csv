instantpot,fj1on69,t1_fiwllem,1582924430.0,Oh goodly. I've made this recipe and another instant pot recipe that called for chicken thighs and I've ended up with a little chicken skin a cartilage in the final product. I was really hoping I could get away with chicken breast instead.

instantpot,f1ddh19,t1_f1dd5lr,1569380642.0,"Turned out pretty good. The pressure cooking never really started and I hit cancel when the warning came on. Was still al dente so cooked it a little longer and they good. I think it was just those mushrooms kickin' it at the bottom of the pot maybe setting off the warning and burning some. Will definitely high pressure cook next time. 
Thanks for the tasty recipe, sorry for frigging it up."

TooAfraidToAsk,f1bvgc5,t3_d8l3wp,1569343866.0,I feel as though I don't like children. I don't know what they can understand at what age and I don't want to patronize them so I usually am very awkward around them and I don't have the patience I should have.

depression,evpjpst,t3_ckmvf8,1564674850.0,The social worker I'm seeing has me journaling and she reads it at our visits. Thank God because when she asks how I am I always say fine. I always forget the things that have happened and what I wrote.
