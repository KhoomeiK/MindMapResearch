It actually surprises me Ubisoft hasn't done a bit of a Metroidvania type map/design for a Prince of Persia game, I feel like that type of game would jive well with Prince of Persia. And I want to say the market is there with Bloodstained, Hollow Knight, and etc. having their success. Not necessarily a 2D Prince of Persia, but a smaller more concise game that strays from Ubisoft's current trend of their open world games would be pretty nice.

And I feel you on the community made beatmaps. I started out learning Osu!Mania, so I definitely get what you mean. It's why I ended up moving to torrenting DJMax Trilogy, and likewise Steam for Invaxion, Musynx, and Tapsonic Bold and now DJMax Respect V is my main game. Like not a knock off to the Osu!Mania community, but especially with the Neowiz games there's just something that's better designed about their beatmaps and variety of music genres. Even with just base game DJMax Respect V there's a really good selection of pop, hip-hop, trance, idm, etc. and I found in Osu!Mania you don't really get that as much and most either seem like songs from anime or the types of hard-hitting fast songs you'd see at higher level gameplay.

TwoBestFriendsPlay,fojmhj9,t1_foih56d,1587824639.0,"The genre of rhythm games never really went away though. DJMax Respect V was a pretty hyped release for rhythm game players last year, especially after we haven't had a DJMax on PC since Trilogy. And the PS4 version of DJMax Respect did fairly well too. I think it's more that when people think of rhythm games in the West they think Guitar Hero, DJ Hero, and Rock Band. Especially since it carries music licenses a lot of people in the West know.

But we rhythm game players still got our games. Just kind of niche I guess or not heard about. Osu! is still kicking and doing it's free stuff, DJMax is still around, Switch has some stuff like Taiko no Tatsujin, Tablets have some solid games, Groove Coaster got releases on consoles/pc, communities are making their own clones of stuff like Clone Hero and K-Shoot Mania. And Spin Rhythm is a pretty unique indie one on Steam that Penny Arcade wrote about of all things.

I think the mostly peripheral heavy rhythm games will struggle getting a huge audience though for sure, but both the Steam and PS4 version of DJMax Respect were developed for their respective controllers, just your basic dualshock or keyboard, and are very good games and would recommend for anyone interested in the genre."

And of course V and VI has had issues from day one, like the horrible way they did the tilesets. I actually don't think the art is terrible like some, but the ports make it even worse."
pcgaming,fofpx6y,t1_fof1wrx,1587740707.0,"XII: Zodiac Age is one of my favorites so maybe I can help, keep in mind this isn't in stone and Zodiac Age is easy enough that you can do what you feel like more or less and the stats actually don't matter a huge amount. And part of what makes Zodiac Age so good is how rewarding the party management is in it compared to the other entries in the franchise so you should definitely do what you think is best for you. More fun that way.

Anyway, pretty much Penelo and Ashe have good stats for mages, I think I usually do Penelo as BLM/WHM and Ashe WHM and whatever else, last time I think I did machinist and white mage and it was fun. Nice to have two white mages if you plan to have two parties too. Vaan is a bit of jack of all trades so you can do whatever with him though I believe Shikari/Foebreaker is a popular choice, while Balthier and Basch are pretty good with combos  (when they attack multiple times in a row) so you could go with Shikari, Bushi, and Uhlan for them mixed with something else. Fran unfortunately is the opposite of Vaan in that she can also do whatever, but not as well, so I think the last time I played I had her as an Archer plus a support magic job like Red Battlemage or Time Battlemage.

Again, the stat differences aren't super huge so you can still do whatever you feel like. I would say good management of gambits matter more than the job selections too. I think only once I felt like I had to restart the game, but I actually don't remember why other than when I had gotten to the Sandsea areas my parties just weren't doing well. With the resetting of jobs that's probably nothing to worry about now.

The only other thing to mention is ,like the other commenter said, is that magic is pretty crazy good in XII."

The first half is whatever to me, but when the song kicks in and they show the more road-trip parts I was pretty hype. Of course only half the actual game, assuming you only play the main story, is actually road-tripping.

It is frustrating though cause the ""journey / road-trip"" is what I want in Final Fantasy, for lack of a better term. The bonding and growth of the characters as they face ever increasing risks with the odds stack against them. A very ""Lord of the Rings"" type story I guess. Which is why I think IX is the strongest Final Fantasy in that regard.

But it is what it is, and I've enjoyed it either way for the few days I've played.

I think that's why I'm very interested in the English version of PSO2 when it hits PC. I love Monster Hunter cause it's basically one of my favorite parts of MMOs (the group content/bosses) and Phantasy Star Online is like the granddaddy of that formula.

It leads to being super confusing, and after I finished the quest there I didn't have any idea what you're supposed to do.

However, there's a lot of quest starters in the Alliance capitals so definitely go there. Speak to the hooded figure after you teleport and you'll start the vanilla main quest. You can do it out of order if you'd prefer to stick with the Elsweyr quest, but it seems  there is a quest for when you first meet Abnur Tharn if you want things to make a bit more sense.

For Ebonheart Pact, Davon's Watch is in Stonefalls. I'm not sure about the others being new, but after some googling it looks like for Aldmeri Dominion the city is in Auridon (Vulkhel Guard) and Daggerfall Covenent is in Glenumbra (Daggerfall). You can find them through the locations tab on the map UI. Hopefully someone will correct me if I'm wrong.

ESO needs to do a way better job of this, I did enjoy the Elsweyr quest a lot though and thought it was really good, but as a new player all of this is way too confusing."

I think you should also add what zones the alliance capitals are in. I know for Ebonheart, Davon's Watch is in Stonefalls, but a lot of the guides on how to start the quest didn't mention this and I had to look it up. I wouldn't know which zones the others are in."

It's more or less how I think about it. I do typically say ""I have schizophrenia"", but I think it's more habit at this point and altogether I couldn't care less.

I think the other issue is how much schizophrenia is capable of affecting a person without people understanding that, at least those of us that still have to live with the symptoms even when on medication, because it affects thinking and perception. As the Elyn Saks book starts with the Aristotle quote, *""For the Activity of the Mind is Life"".* A lot of people that argue for ""person-first language"" don't realize this, and just assume it's hallucinations and delusions. So any person that says ""I'm schizophrenic"" I understand as them also saying ""This is how I live my life"".

I think a lot of it also comes from stigma, as stigma has various forms even if well-meaning, and even among those in mental health advocacy. Every time when ""mental health awareness"" comes around I'll just sit here and see more people not talking about my disorder as they pat each other on the back with the language they use.

There's also this comparison image of some of the stuff the expansions added, though with updates they've added some more stuff too.

It's genuinely a lot of content for an arpg, but it really boils down to how much one likes these types of arpgs or Grim Dawn specifically enough. And of course some people love arpgs, like Path of Exile or Diablo, but can't get into Grim Dawn. My personal bias says you should get them as Crate has been a solid developer. There's not an arpg that offers as much depth as Grim Dawn does with its combination of great itemization, dual masteries, and the devotion tree in my opinion. You can also view what they did with patches for 2019, their last one being that they overhauled a lot of the base game items and affixes [(link)](https://forums.crateentertainment.com/t/grim-misadventure-167-a-look-back-at-2019/95076)."

 *Try not to think too much about it, because too much paranoia about reality can be exhausting, in my experience.*

One I remember is believing that someone was sending me messages in the form of songs, and then stressing over what the message was or if it didn't exist at all. Doing things I learned from CBT, fact checking, etc. I get stuck in this loop of thought that I don't know how to explain. It ends up in this internal conflict that is so exhausting that I end up just not wanting to have thoughts or beliefs altogether.

As far as what I mean by the trauma of drawing connections, having things be meaningful can be distressing to me and often times I would rather they not be."
schizophrenia,fi4i3wb,t1_fi4fa07,1582141636.0,"so this is unrelated to op's question, but i am curious cause i've sought out trauma therapy before and I couldn't find that it had any effect on me. I've always wondered if this is because i suffer more from delusions, especially paranoid ones, than hallucinations. I do have them but usually it's color or light, sometimes words and phrases, or like bugs crawling / clicking.

But I still don't know how to deal with beliefs I have about people sufficiently, and I was diagnosed almost 10 years ago now. I want to say paranoia can be its own type of trauma, but like how does one actually deal with the trauma of drawing connections / patterns between unrelated things? Would you happen to have any insight? Maybe if you have any material I could read or discuss with my psychiatrist / therapist I would be greatly appreciative."

at times i would argue that meaninglessness can be more comforting than meaningfulness, but both can dangerous to an extent. maybe more so with having schizophrenia, i'm not sure. it's difficult to gauge for personally, but i also lack a fair bit of self-awareness.

I also wouldn't know if it's related to having schizophrenia either, to me it sort of seems more a general human thing from observation. Like a motivation through apathy, despite knowing that it's all meaningless anyway but if it is all meaningless anyway than what's the point of not doing shit too just the same as it being meaningless to do it to begin with?

Amd,fh93i8o,t3_f1v676,1581372778.0,"Sapphire Pulse 5700xt owner here, about 3 weeks now. I'll take the survey but also wanted to detail my issues. Some other info is I use a MAG241C 1080p monitor, MSI X470 board, Ryzen 5 2600x, 3200mhz ram, and 850w power supply with two separate cables for the 5700xt.

So some games it runs flawlessly, Shadow of the Tomb Raider being one I've been replaying. Some performance is suboptimal, such as AC Odyssey (\~50fps in dense areas on various settings) which is of course already notorious for its poor performance, and I do get some weird stutters at times in Sims 4 but it's mostly fine. Grim Dawn, another game I play a lot, seems to be okay as well but I haven't sunken my teeth into a full run in a couple months. And testing out the Wolcen beta preparing for release it seems to be okay too outside of initial stuttering when it does particle effects I guess, but after a bit it seems fine.

That aside, I got the card just for Monster Hunter World's Iceborne expansion and, yeah, that game has been nothing but issues. I think that one's mostly on Capcom though. I've hardly gotten to play it due to all the issues from the High Resolution Texture Pack causing stuttering, random ERR12 crashes both with the texture pack enabled and disabled, and the most recent update made DX11 completely unplayable with how bad it stutters and performs while DX12 performs fine outside of the crashing.

There was also an issue were on driver installation it messed up my Xbox controller, mouse, keyboard, and audio (Realtek and Nahimic 3) drivers. Reinstalling those again seemed to have resolved it though. Initially I did get black screens, but after going to 20.1.3, setting the PCIE slots to force gen 3, and updating x470 chipset drivers I have yet to encounter it. There's also been some freezing while using chrome, but disabling hardware acceleration seems to have fixed it the past few days but it might be too soon to tell.

I have not played any older games such as DX9 ones that I've heard people mention having problems in though. One game I'm curious how it will perform in is Phantasy Star Online 2, which is now I think an 8 year old game despite now only about to get an English language release. Hopefully it works."

Ultimately, it is difficult to say who should and shouldn't know, and when they should if you want them to. And yes, sometimes people won't take it well but I do think there is more to gain overall than there is to lose. And I do think most people don't really need to know if you don't want them to, but I think for general wellbeing it still good for some to. There is also the possibility that medication could help some, like anti-anxiety meds, if it's something you go through.

As far as random people, or the stigma, I never exactly knew how to help people deal with it. Perhaps others will have better insight on it than I will. For me it's just I don't really have much to lose anymore, which I don't think is an answer most will want to hear. I've always disliked idealism when talking about mental health though."

Art style, build mode, and some other features it has is pretty solid while still having a lot of places that are disappointing.

Can get a solid side panel or tempered glass panel too depending on your preference. Unfortunately it seems they might be hard to get at the moment, prob cause of the holidays. But nice room to upgrade, supports 315mm graphics cards with front fans installed, and has detachable dust filters which are kind of a must have for me personally.

Another brand to look into is Phanteks, I hear their cases are pretty good. And Cooler Master has some more budget cases like the NR600 that I remember hearing about. And a lot of people like the designs on some of the NZXT cases, but I don't think the airflow is as good in those but idk. I don't know when case manufacturers start new lines typically either so some might be phasing out? No idea.

The Witcher show spoonfeeds you lore and exposition a ton, but does it at a fast pace and not all that well due to its structure. I adore the books and the games, but still the show could've really used breathing room for people to be grounded and latch onto Geralt as a character and then introduce Yennefer and Ciri later. That's really my only complaint with it though, especially the Renfri and Striga episodes really needed their space I think. Great stories for people to get a feel of Geralt, what a witcher is, and the world itself but the show muddies it up a bit."
