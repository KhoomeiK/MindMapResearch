Some did try to throw me under the bus for certain things, like someone once tried to report me for every tiny thing because I offered to pick up extra work and my coworker thought my boss was playing favorites and giving me more resonsibility when I had simply offered to do the task myself.  I ignored it. I simply said I was grateful that someone was keeping me on my toes and making sure patients received the best care possible. Eventually most of these drama makers left because they were clearly overall unhappy in their position.

I am a really chill person, though, and I've been complimented a couple of times for being good at avoiding drama and staying out of messes. If someone wants to vent to me about drama, which they have on numerous occasions, I'll listen to be polite, but I won't say anything negative about anyone.

pharmacy,f3j1cu7,t1_f3iyhur,1570945417.0,"Substance abuse disorders are a lot more prevalent than you'd think. It's reported that almost 9% of people have resolved a substance abuse problem and 10% of people have a substance abuse disorder at some point in their life. Just because it's not officially diagnosed and treated by a physician doesn't mean it wasn't a problem.

  
The belief that healthcare professionals that prescribe or dispense shouldn't be able to practice anymore if they've ever had a drug or alcohol use problem is part of what keeps so many from seeking proper help.

As per their website: ""We believe that professionals who have a substance use disorder or mental health problem should be offered the chance to enter recovery and confront their problems before having disciplinary action taken against their licenses."""

TalesFromThePharmacy,f3ha5bm,t3_dgyvik,1570920998.0,"I'm sure it depends on what state you're in, but that's illegal in some states. My state's pharmacy laws actually explicitly prohibit animals living in the pharmacy, aside from aquarium fish. I simply remember this because it made me chuckle when I was studying for the state law exam.

I would bring it up with the owner and look up your state's laws."
