AmItheAsshole,fp57n5l,t3_gb8jgy,1588319138.0," ESH. you are definitely projecting your grief and attempting to control how your SIL handles it, but I think your SIL should have watched what she was saying around someone who had also gone through that awful experience. It's also cruel and unacceptable for people to insist you should be over your child's death.

 My heart aches for you, and i know it can be difficult to comprehend people not handling grieving from something the same way as you. (Not being sarcastic) you get so wrapped up in your own emotions it's hard to look at things objectively.

 If i were you I would apologize to your SIL, and acknowledge you deal with things differently. I would also ask her to not talk about this topic while you're around, since her way of dealing with it triggers an intense and distressing emotional response for you. 
  
You are entitled to take care of yourself but not to control other people's emotional responses, avoiding the topic with her would be for the best."
autism,fomhbvu,t3_g7sywi,1587890029.0,"It fluctuates from 1 to 10 depending what the setting is or who I'm talking to. In work settings where I habe to be professional I am a 10 because I mask all the time, it's super exhausting though so it's hard for me to keep jobs because of the burn out i experience. Meeting new people in a casual setting? 1-4. Id say im usually around a 7."
truscum,flfn4v2,t3_fnx1mt,1585111176.0,I feel like posts like this would be better if they just used gender neutral language for anyone on their period. Specifically being for trans boys and using all this cutesy language is a little weird.
CPTSD,fla96yv,t3_fney3e,1584979259.0,"Yes, i absolutely hate it. My abuser is family so seeing sentiments about how ""but they're family!"" Makes me very upset.

 I want to add i also have trouble with...i guess... the opposite of this?

 I have many complicated feelings about my abuser (maybe because they are family, maybe because I was groomed, maybe just my nature doesn't lean toward me totally condemning people often, or all 3 and more) However I often feel like the messages I get are always one or the other. Like I'm told to forgive OR that they are completely irredeemable and should die, and while i agree with the second one more and I want to cut contact when I can, it makes me feel guilty or like a ""bad"" survivor for having weird mixed feelings of both. Like I'm not allowed to? I have only told one person about my mixed feelings and they almost seemed..mad at me?

I am only talking about MY abuser of course, I support any and all feelings people have toward their own abusers. 

Sorry if that is totally off topic, I am a little sleep deprived."

They're right, the shirt Does look cool. Maybe it'll even make them listen to the band eventually."

BPD,fd5ix3b,t3_ek1l1c,1578178085.0,For me I have two constant aesthetics that are directly opposing [Very over the top gothic and then very over the top girly/pink/decora-ish clothing. And I constantly swing from very masculine to very feminine] I will spend a few months being only goth then feel restricted by it and go back to being girly. I'm in that phase right now! I need to go back to being blonde soon lmao.
BPD,fd5hzrh,t3_ejsazd,1578177871.0,"Yes, 90% of the time i only want affection from my boyfriend (who i guess would be my fp though I tend to avoid that term). Anyone else offering me affection is either something i just ignore or it's downright irritating. I feel awful about it and I can't exactly explain ""I don't want to talk to YOU about this. Only my boyfriend."" Without coming off like an asshole or that I'm making up all my problems to get attention from him. I'm not..he's just the only person that will genuinely help."

BPD,fcej6x6,t3_eh33lv,1577620965.0,Yes..I feel like it's really confusing to explain. I tend to not believe i'm capable of empathy in moments where i feel emotionless/unempathetic and then when i feel intense empathy I also spiral into this intense WHO AM I?? moment lmao.

adultsurvivors,fc2ezxm,t3_efptuh,1577356386.0,"I deal with similar feelings, especially not being able to make advances on my own. I attempt to in order to normalize it for myself, but these instances are usually months apart and the last time I asked my boyfriend if he wanted to have fun together it made me so anxious i had an anxiety attack and started crying, he had to calm me down. 

  I would say seeing a therapist is a good idea, As for my own personal experience I do not have a therapist yet unfortunately. having my boyfriend reassure me that he doesn't see me as dirty or a bad person for wanting sex has helped me immensely, but it is only after several repeated assurances that it has started to help."
adultsurvivors,fc2emup,t1_fc0yjj3,1577355781.0,"I'm sorry that happened to you. This is basically what I am afraid of, and even if they did support me telling the story to them at all would be far too traumatizing."
adultsurvivors,fbzqxc2,t1_fbzqrwd,1577257029.0,"Thank you so much and I'm so, so sorry you went through that. My abuser is my half brother so very similar situation but he's my only sibling.

It's comforting to know you chose to do the same thing as me, just so I know I'm not alone in this decision. 

Thank you for sharing, take care of yourself as well!"
adultsurvivors,fbyl4fq,t1_fbxtk8x,1577219671.0,"Yeah, it hurts when people close to you don't react properly. Everyone processes trauma differently and the reactions you get when someone thinks you're handling yours in the ""wrong way"" really hurt. I'm sorry you have to deal with that."
BorderlinePDisorder,f6axgjf,t1_f65nfo7,1572764232.0,"this is EXACTLY how I feel at all my jobs!! I always start super excited then it slowly gets dulled down and I start becoming paranoid and doubtful of myself, I take any bad interaction extremely personally, and It's very hard for me to realize even if a coworker has a small frustration with me over work related issues it doesn't mean they hate me. I need tons of praise to make it through my my work without becoming stressed out."
BorderlinePDisorder,f6ax6xs,t1_f65vuhn,1572764069.0,"I'm glad to find other people relate too! I am younger so i am only taking entry level jobs such as hosting/retail work. Right now i am looking for jobs that have looser dress codes that will allow me to have odd colored hair/piercings/tattoos because I feel like I have a lot of frustration with work dress codes since I feel the need to change my appearance all the time. I would like to look into other, more interesting lines of work that might hold my attention or at least be less overwhelming, but I'm not too sure what right now."
BorderlinePDisorder,f62r9jh,t1_f62qzf1,1572665725.0,I'm glad I'm not alone in this! However I am also a people pleaser and liked several of my coworkers but I still left. All it really does is make me feel insanely guilty but it doesn't stop me. Probably because I already tend to self isolate and cut people off for no reason.
cursedcomments,f3t9216,t3_dhz22f,1571123173.0,People saying this is natural selection need to learn to have some sympathy for an actual child. Amazing. Imagine if a young relative of yours died and the reactions were filled with assholes saying they deserve it.
