Your daughter is actively seeking help and trust me when I say asking for help is hard. She is extremely strong to be able to not only recognise her issues but ask for help to get over them. If you refuse to let your daughter have the help she needs then it would make her feel like she is overreacting when she isn‚Äôt. Also comparing her fathers issues to her own will once again make her feel like she is overreacting and it will also make her feel guilty. The best thing to do is to talk to her about this, if you *really* can‚Äôt afford to take her to therapy then explain this to her and help her seek out alternatives. Otherwise you should let her have what she needs, doing so will show her that she can rely on you when she needs help and will improve both your relationships as well."
