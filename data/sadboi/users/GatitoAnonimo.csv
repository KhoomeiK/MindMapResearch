OCD,fkohqv4,t3_fjl8ej,1584387464.0,"Yes after I quit drinking it started and the intrusive thoughts, panic, dread, and shame hit me almost all day every day (I've struggled with depression, anxiety, addiction, and C-PTSD nearly my entire life). I'd get some relief during sleep but the minute I'd wake up the thoughts and panic would start again. It was absolute agony. The feelings were horrible. This lasted 18 months at full intensity. Then I started meditating and journaling daily. That finally seemed to improve things. I'd say I'm maybe 80 to 90% recovered from it but am still dealing with the trauma and other things.   

If you're in crisis and can't get treatment (I tried too but the one OCD specialist sucked) I suggest doing anything you can to help yourself. Here are some of the things I do:

Walk / exercise daily. 

Meditate 20 minutes a day. I sit with my horrible feelings and just feel them. This has helped reduce the intensity a LOT. 

Journal 750 words a day minimum. Stream of consciousness. I write whatever comes to mind. 

Eat as healthy as possible. No drugs or alcohol (including caffeine). I eat a low fat plant based diet and have lost over 100 pounds so far. 

Read anything I can on the subject and try to do what the books say to do. Dare: The New Way to End Anxiety and Stop Panic Attacks helped a lot. Imp of the Mind. Others.

Watch Claire Weekes videos on anxiety. Lots of others on OCD and anxiety too.

Get comfortable feeling uncomfortable. Learn to deal with anxiety / OCD the right way. It takes time to recover but if I can anyone can. It's still there but it's in the background most of the time. At its worst it's annoying. Before it felt like absolute agony every waking moment of every godforsaken day.

Hang in there. Get as much help as you can."

Check this list out and see if it applies to your sister at all. It's from the book Disarming The Narcissist:

EXERCISE: Is the difficult person in your life a narcissist? Check off the traits that show up excessively, more often than not.

1. Self-absorbed (acts like everything is all about him or her)

2. Entitled (makes the rules; breaks the rules)

3. Demeaning (puts you down, bullyish)

4. Demanding (of whatever he or she wants)

5. Distrustful (suspicious of your motives when you're being nice to him or her)

6. Perfectionistic (rigidly high standards - his or her way or no way)

7. Snobbish (believes he or she is superior to you and others; gets bored easily)

8. Approval seeking (craves constant praise and recognition)

9. Unempathic (uninterested in understanding your inner experience, or unable to do so)

10. Unremorseful (cannot offer a genuine apology)

11. Compulsive (gets overly consumed with details and minutiae)

12. Addictive (cannot let go of bad habits; uses them to self-soothe)

13. Emotionally detached (steers clear of feelings)

If 10 of 13 traits are checked, the person most likely meets the criteria for overt maladaptive narcissism, the most common and difficult form."

The more I do this the more irritating Ns seem to be to me just automatically. 

Then finally having an ""escape hatch"" so I'm not stuck in a job again with a screaming nut job N boss. It happens and sometimes is out of our control. I think all this stuff adds up. So far seems to be working for me."

ManagedByNarcissists,ezvprwr,t3_d29b0m,1568189886.0,"\> It just makes me so angry, still.

I get it. I was *just* talking about this with someone. They almost never seem to experience any real consequences in my experience, even after detailing to HR what had been going on. It's so hard not to feel angry and resentful about this. I still see an old boss who screwed me over getting awards on LinkedIn (shared connections). Infuriating.

I try to adhere to the philosophy that the best revenge is to live the best life I can (as much of a bitter pill as that can be). It just seems like this is life, something we have to accept. There are a lot of bad people getting away with bad shit. Best I can do is try to detect and avoid them if possible and put the ones I've worked with out of my mind.

I also live as light as I can, paid off my debt, and saved up a little ""FU money"" so I'll never be stuck in a toxic working environment again. I think this is one of the best things we can do to avoid this situation in the future."

""Warm spare"" system along with dual remote backup systems doing incremental snapshot sends every five minutes (the FreeNAS min. but soon moving to FreeBSD and will do one minute or less).

datingoverthirty,ezqgl1s,t1_ezm6bbg,1568058936.0,"> I kinda go for modest, low key guys who are maybe a little down on their luck in love. 

Kind of reminds me of what my first therapist used to call ""taking the low bidder."" I get it. I tend to go for a certain type too. Luckily over the years I've learned to identify and change these patterns (the book Getting Past Your Breakup really helped with this). Dealing with a ton of drama and BS and getting tired of it probably helped the most though.

I actually turned down coffee with a very attractive gal recently because she's very much like the type I usually go for (selfish, self-centered, not very nice, gives annoying unsolicited crappy advice, etc.) but I've had enough of that and don't even want to be friends with people like this. I find that I've become less attracted to these types of women too."
zfs,ez0wg1t,t3_czph52,1567642866.0,"I went through all of this and decided upon striped mirrors for our file server. Faster resilver speeds, better random  performance. Has worked well for two years. RAID-Z2 for backup servers.

I also perform a disk burn-in process before going into production if I can. SMART short test then long. Then I run badblocks over the entire disk. Then another long test. This hopefully weeds out obvious duds."

OK so it's not just *my* flippin' coworkers. They will generate 5000 alert emails every few weeks for example when they have done so *many* times in the past and should f'n know better. Sometimes I think they are seriously brain damaged because that's how they act sometimes."
creepy,eswotvs,t1_esuqt5c,1562318301.0,If this was in early 00s I saw this and still think about it. Scarred me for life. I can still remember it vividly. Still saddens me deeply that this sort of thing goes on. I wonder what makes people so fucked up they do things like this.

CPTSD,eslgeop,t3_c879dn,1562085214.0,"Yep. It's hard not to feel cursed and abanonded by god/life/whatever after decades of this shit. Add to that a steam of terrible therapists. Too expensive to keep going anyway because of the insane American medical system (over$400/mo).

Therapy was super helpful early on but now it's unaffordable so I stick to books, journaling, daily meditation, exercise, super healthy eating (whole foods), AA (no drugs or alcohol), etc. Just whatever help I can get because I need every last bit of it. Things are improving but I'm always waiting for the next catastrophe.

I'm in a pretty good place now but I could die at any time and I'd be ok with that. I've had enough life."
AskReddit,esk835v,t1_esk2o0m,1562054690.0,Ugh that sounds awful and sadly like most women I encounter. It's so rare for them to ask me about me that it surprises me when it happens. Just making friends seems impossible sometimes.

CPTSD,eojji5v,t3_brdvdx,1558638718.0,"I have the same issue. In fact, I was just going to make a post about it but decided to search first and coincidentally you just posted this.

This has always been an issue for me. My theory is that it's because we weren't allowed to act out in ANY way growing up. My mother would have hurt us. Sad, happy, angry, it did not matter, she wouldn't tolerate it. I rarely get sick because that wasn't tolerated either. It's as if I have a self-protection program that fires up and shuts any of that down when it happens.

That and I have had a lot of traumatic stuff happen as an adult so I don't know if that has anything to do with it. I feel like I could cry for a million years and it would never be enough yet I can never seem to get more than a tear or two.

The last time I had an all-body bawl session was after I broke up with my BPD ex. My whole body convulsed as if I was purging a toxin (and she was). It was WONDERFUL. Man I wish I could do that more often.

Pete Walker (therapist, wrote a couple books on abuse/feeling/C-PTSD) says that he's talked people out of active suicidality by getting them to cry. He talks about grieving through tears as being so healing and beneficial. I too think this would help. Hopefully we all can figure out how to access that again.

Here are some things I'm doing now to heal:

* Writing 750 words / three pages of stream of consciousness a day.
* Meditating for at least 20 minutes a day (vipassana). That reminds me. Not long ago I started to cry during meditation a little. It was great.
* Allowing myself to feel anything that comes up.
* Talking to safe people about what's going on.
* This is on top of a base of eating super healthy (whole plant foods) and daily exercise. No drugs or alcohol (not even caffeine because anxiety/OCD already has me hopped up so much as it is).

I can't help but feel that if I continue on this path, I will gain access to the tears again. Worse case, I'm healing. I think it's about *allowing* the tears to come and one day they will."
CPTSD,eojh2wt,t1_eod4szv,1558637784.0,"I feel so deeply but aside from tearing up and maybe an episode or two of minimal tears, I got nothin'. I don't get why."
