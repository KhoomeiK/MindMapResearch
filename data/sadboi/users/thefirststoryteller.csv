Here are a few things I've done to work on healing myself. I hope that some of these might work for you!

Daily journaling, meditation, gratitude lists, mood tracking, and reading self-help books have really helped me. (By self-help books I don't mean Eckhart Tolle stuff, I'm talking DBT workbooks, workbooks for PTSD, whatever. My goal is not to assign myself a diagnosis or one approach over another, my goal is to look at a wide range of tools and pick some that sound promising.) It helps me to be intentional and direct with what I want out of each day and in what mood(s) I'm in each day. 

I found myself carrying a lot of distrust, anger, guilt, even jealousy as well. I think it is pretty clear where those sensations come from for me. Once I identified these sensations I had to decide what to do with them. Carrying them forever is an option, sure. But I found another solution once I re-framed how I thought of myself. 

I don't consider myself the same person who went through these terrible, violating, unethical, and perhaps even criminal experiences. Those were prior versions of myself, kind of like how The Doctor regenerates in Doctor Who. 

My 12-13 year old self did get mishandled by that goateed shrink. But I was just a kid. The shrink chose his actions and he has, as far as I can tell, had to pay for those actions. 12-13 year old me was blameless. But I've set aside that younger version of myself now, and that means I also have to set aside the anger and betrayal from my experience. I'm a new man now. 

I briefly got into drugs for a bit which was a destructive, wrong-headed, and deadly decision. But in my recovery efforts I did learn new ways of thinking which helped me. I saw that people used different healing methods. That helped me realize that not only is healing not linear, it's also not uniform. 

This is why I get a little frustrated when I believe someone is treating therapy or medication or any solution as a catch-all. Only you can decide what's right for you. 

I started working on hobbies and interests because I wanted an identity for myself beyond ""these bad things happened to me"". I found that I really enjoyed helping people, especially groups of people that are usually overlooked, underserved, and who experience high needs, like people living in poverty and people living with disabilities. And sometimes they'd get down on themselves. But their friends would show them a lot of compassion. So when I get critical with myself I try to build some self-compassion. And if that isn't as helpful on any given day I try to re-frame my opinion about myself. Rather than ""I'm dramatic"" I try to go with ""I am expressive, I am emotionally aware."" and so on.

I'm happy to answer any questions you have or anyone has."
AskMenOver30,fqi54tl,t1_fqi0a1k,1589390276.0,"Okay, so are you saying that you gotta find a SO who's about 25-30 and who shares some hobbies/interests with you and who also (ideally) finds you attractive enough to spend some time with you?"
TalkTherapy,fqi3edk,t1_fqhvuw7,1589389280.0,"Well, I'd say I've decided to leave because she does know I've been to therapy. I believe that, as a result of this knowledge, she's put up some walls between us that make genuine conversations difficult. I've asked her about this and the response was ""I know you have your own issues, I don't want to burden you.""(But we were talking just fine before I revealed this part of my history.) She's not toxic in my opinion, but fixing the relationship is more work than a do-over.

Overall I think I have a different perspective than you do on the matter of past issues. I've often found that a fresh start is really helpful. For me it makes things like developing new, healthy coping mechanisms and engaging in meaningful self-help practices much easier. Maybe my experience would be different if all I did was move around.

I've lived on both coasts and in the South. Right now I'm in the eastern time zone again. I'm just past 30 and I have a lot of life (and a lot of the continental US) left to explore."

Howwastoday,fprh4p3,t3_gevv7g,1588853994.0,"Wednesday 5-6-20 wasn't good or bad. I didn't play video games as long as I would have liked because I couldn't keep my attention on it. 

I live with my fiancee, she has anxiety and depression and, i'd bet, a good bit of PTSD/generational trauma from her fucked up family. Quarantine means we spend even more time together and I've only now gotten a front seat to her struggles. We've really come to work on our communication more and she says she appreciates it. 

5-6-20, like many days recently, I journaled, used an app called Youper to track my mood, meditated, and tried to relax when I found myself tensing up. I had also ordered tons of self-help books and I got to unbox those yesterday. 

The thing is....I'm not doing all of this for me. I thought the original plan was that she and I would do these things together: keep a quarantine journal, set aside time for meditating and relaxing, use strategies in the self-help books. I thought it could benefit us both. Hell, I think anyone can use coping mechanisms you'd learn from mental health providers, not just folks with diagnosed mental illness.

But, uh, it's only been me doing this stuff and I feel resentful about it. I don't have the words to address this in a neutral and fair way with her yet. On one hand I think these practices could help both of us and could be fun things we do together. On the other, I know that ""hey use these resources"" can be vague and overwhelming, while ""hey let's try meditating three nights a week"" can be less daunting. 

Honestly.....we've been together 4 years, she's been so strong, we've done a lot together, but lately the bad days are very bad, the good days aren't ""good"", they're just days where nothing bad happens or where small nice things occur, like a bird using the birdbath. It's difficult knowing that all of my efforts to help go either unnoticed or they move the needle so slightly that it isn't worth the effort. 

Lately I've been wondering what it would be like to date someone without mental illness. Someone I wouldn't have to support through one rude or expensive therapist after another, someone who wouldn't have to talk about her latest shitty therapist only to be met with ""NoT aLl ThErApIsTs ArE bAd!!1"" which is the same as like saying ""not all men"" or ""not all cops"". Someone who doesn't put our sex life on hold because of this pill or that, SSRIs and antidepressants which introduce a ton of side effects that rarely go away and have little to no benefit. 
Imagine just....not having to deal with your partner's abusive family or their poor mental health. Imagine dating someone whose mood is good more often than not, someone with whom you can just have fun. 
Obviously all couples have their problems but if I dated someone mentally healthy I can't help but think there would be more good times and fewer bad times. 

Aside from that, I consulted with a mental health professional because I was asked to write a ""how to stay resilient"" column for my work's newsletter; I'm disabled and at higher risk for severe COVID symptoms if I am infected, but I work a lot to support the disabled community, especially folks with my same condition. So I asked if the MH professional had any ideas besides my own (which I had told him about) and his suggestions were pretty common sense. I sent him a warm thank you email and got a very tepid, professional-speak reply. It could have come right out of a template. I feel like I put in a lot of work and the other guy did not.

MadOver30,foj8z6w,t3_g7a4nd,1587813093.0,"Had to talk with a therapist as part of my annual job evaluation; we do deal with COVID stuff so I can see the employer's reasoning behind getting everyone to talk to someone. 

I answered a few questions (No I don't feel hopeless, no I don't want to harm myself or someone else, yes I see that life has changed and I'm using coping mechanisms to help me.) but otherwise had no issues so I used the rest of the time to get advice on what's bothering my fiancee and friends (enforcing boundaries, anxiety over texting back, etc.) and just pretended they were my own worries so as to protect their identities. 

I **did** talk to my coworkers and this all happened to them too. We're gonna go to leadership and ask them to warn us beforehand next time. 

**ALSO!!** I finally realized how much extra work it is to support an SO with mental illness. I've been reading self-help books, using my training as a drug counselor, and looking up online articles all to help my SO handle her issues. And yet I fear she may still go to therapy and give all credit to her therapist; she has not been the best at showing gratitude toward me in the past. 

So I decided if I am ever single again and I'm on the market, I'll be looking for women who have 0 mental illness and have never seen a therapist. It'd be just so much easier"

AskMenOver30,fo6ux62,t3_g5ypi7,1587567191.0,"I did a lot of research on my own which included working through workbooks, reading articles, reading books, meditating, and trusting my fiancée. Ever since this Quarantine began  we have been spending more time around each other so we’ve both had to learn how to communicate more effectively. For me that looks like being open, vulnerable, and trusting with her in ways that I wasn’t before.

I have been to a few therapists when I was a kid and I never, ever had a good experience. I’m happy for people like u/SANcapITY who have had good results, but I will never return to therapy after I had been sexually molested and emotionally abused by different mental health practitioners. 

It has taken intense work and continues to be a lot of work but I’m already seeing benefits. And I’m even more happy with myself knowing that I myself got me this far.

I believe that if you want to work on your emotional intelligence you are best served by doing that work alongside your partner, the person you are sharing and will share your life with."
philadelphia,fo6r9xy,t1_fo6mnbu,1587565190.0,"That's a good point. My employer does offer a EAP program which includes a set number of counseling sessions a year. We're told it's confidential. 

I did an internship once with a nonprofit that offered EAP services too, but the leadership of the nonprofit reserved the right to get some demographic info about whoever used the service. So the executive director wouldn't hear ""Tim in your finance department has met with us three times in the last six months to talk about work-life balance"", but they would hear ""male employee in finance has met with us three times in the last six months"" which, if you're one of the few men or only man in the finance department, is just as bad. 

ED's justification was ""I pay a lot of money to provide EAP to my employees and I need to see if I'm getting my money worth.""

Dunno if it's like that everywhere but it def made me think twice about using any EAP service"

We're asking all employees to talk to this guy since COVID is such a weird, stressful time.""

I was sorta shocked and I would have massively preferred to be told of this ahead of time, but OK. Told the shrink about my daily routine and how I stay active and happy. Then I ran out of things to talk about so I sought advice for my friends and family (ie ""OK shrink, friend of mine has issues setting boundaries with toxic family what can they do?"")

Gonna call into my team's lunch hangout today to see if this happened to anyone else. Feels sorta sketchy."

Antipsychiatry,fo496rf,t3_g5fm23,1587500353.0,"Can only speak in my own experience but here we go. 

I live in the US like a lot of you (I assume) and for a long long time we had a general expectation in society that we do not talk about mental illness. Better to get hauled off to an asylum (happened to my grandma because we didn't understand postpartum depression in the 1950s) or to spend your day blasted with pills than talk openly about it. 

Now I think we are kinda overcompensating. Medication shouldn't be the catch-all answer it now seems to be, nor should most people be on meds indefinitely. Meds should be there as a secondary or tertiary option that, in most cases, is temporary. 

 We can also look to what other nations are doing that maybe we aren't. This can help shake up the ""get 'em on meds and in therapy!"" approach we see so often. Meds and therapy aren't bad don't get me wrong. But it's not for everyone. 

We need more free, peer-led support groups. AA and NA helped me get clean and I think if we had Depression Anonymous or Anxiety Anonymous that would be good. 

However any new ideas/solutions face an uphill battle. Especially in the US people are very set in their ways and their beliefs. And there's something called ""cognitive dissonance"" which basically means ""any viewpoints or facts that challenge my point of view are incorrect and I will ignore them."""

Didn't realize 'til I began DMing myself that, like, prepping for a session for a set group takes time and effort. Throwing in new players last second makes it harder.
