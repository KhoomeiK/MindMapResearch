getdisciplined,flrp21p,t1_flrcb1b,1585424822.0,"Resources:

Recently I've been watching Katy Morton on youtube, she has very informative videos on attachment styles.

School of life videos really soothe me when I feel insecure.

I usually do a google/quora/reddit search and binge read whatever shows up :)

I have been reading some Bukowski, Maya Angelou and Dushka Zapata. It fills my heart in ways a relationship cannot.

I agree that it is normal to have expectations, but have found that I am happier and more giving in general after I tried to re-frame those. 

Of course I am not advocating staying in a relationship that depletes you, but to not fall prey to your own insecurities and unchecked thoughts.

 Also to be respectful of difference, he may take a long time to open up, or may never, but you may choose to be with him regardless. 

Mainly, what is within your grasp here?

Feel free to pm me if you feel like discussing this further, or just vent."
getdisciplined,flr53w9,t1_flr0s41,1585413161.0,"How long has it been?
I'd say to take a step back and see what he does. Ultimately trust your own judgement. 

I was debating this for a while, then I realized I am not ready to give up on this guy. There is something between us - that he may try and conceal - but is there nevertheless. A connection.

We did break up multiple times in the first months.

What makes me feel like shit in my relationship is:

 Expecting him to show me love in the way I want it. For example: Tentatively messaging ' I like you ' just to know where we stand. 

That goes for wanting validation, wanting to feel like this is building something, wanting to feel secure. Pressuring and not accomplishing anything but him blowing up. 

I have been in therapy to cope with past trauma. and ever since we started seeing each other I have been trying my best to openly communicate my fears and needs, and to be someone he can rely on.
 I want to practice a less selfish love, you know?


Regarding the attachment style, I am by no means an expert.

 - Building self-confidence and self-reliance
 - My fears are my own - Tough but true words by him. Mindfulness helps me with this.
 - Being myself when with him, expressing myself and my needs without games or fear.
 - Educating myself through internet resources.
 - Not taking the fixing approach, knowing these things have their way of sorting themselves out.

Hope this helps a small bit :)"

getdisciplined,flpvd3y,t1_flpq312,1585369912.0,"Going through a similar situation also, with me being the anxious party. These relationships challenge us and can make us better imo. What helps me whenever I feel let down :

 - I try to keep in mind that I am expecting him to act according to what *I think* is right.

 - I try to examine my own insecurities and needs. My first impulse is to chase and shower partner with affection (expecting something in return).

 - I try for compassion and time to myself. With the pandemic I have been reflecting on the importance of working on myself, as it is often also the best I can do for others.

I think we should all value our time and strive to have amazing rewarding relationships. However sometimes I wonder if we aren't collectively giving up on others a little too soon. 

Although I have a predominantly anxious attachment style, I am now trying my best to change into a secure one."

 * drinking alcohol or coffee
 * Waiting for public transportation
 * Meeting someone new 
 * Playing cards

If you are able to identify these situations, then you can curb the cravings ahead, and avoid exposing yourself to unnecessary hardship.

Other people are complex beings with their own inner lives and motives. Their 'running away' may have nothing to do with you.

You seem nice. Don't let your head run wild with these baseless thoughts.
Do a careful examination of your social interactions and go from there:
 
 *Maybe you are coming across as a bit too eager? 

 *Maybe you should explain your jokes better?

 * Perhaps guys are playfully teasing you, just to get you to interact more?

It is hard feeling unrequited and out of place, but you should always be unapologetically yourself. 

Loving yourself is the foundation for building successful relationships with others, just work on that and keep meeting new people. I am sure you will meet some cool ones.

* I am a sucker for attention, so when someone shows interest in me, even faint one, I will probably start fantacizing about them romantically. I realized this goes away if I am aware of it

* I will do some heavy mental gymnastics to be able to stay close to the person. Like, not stalking, but close.

I now triple check myself before action, because my brain fools me in this.

 I'm really not into shaming and demonizing something we all want but sometimes are unsure how to get from others.

Having a disregulated need for attention is a trait present in several mental disorders eg. narcissism, bpd, depression.

 I'm trying to use my quitting to leverage other positive behaviours involving discipline... like depriving myself of sweets or waking up early.

I smoked for 10 years and felt like a loser with no self-control, quitting was really empowering."

 What is the meaning of the dot ""."" notation?

I read this as: for all x there is no y that satisfies Q property, is equivalent to for every x every y doesn't satisfy Q property?"

 I think there are some things you can improve upon, disregard this part if advice is unwanted:

Your hair, it is fine and I think you would look better with a more voluminous hair-do. it looks a bit damaged too. I would suggest a reddish tone henna, it would compliment your eye colour.

Your eyebrows are overtweezed, let them fill in a bit.

Makeup wise I would suggest you go lighter on the foundation and try eyeshadow vs the liner, as the liner looks too crisp.

It looks like your lips are the same color as the rest of your face, so either less foundation on lips or a different colour lipstick. Hope this helps."

socialskills,f737kev,t3_du88q1,1573388854.0,"She is probably aware you have feelings for her since you already asked her out once. The way to know for sure is to ask. Just ask her if she is interested. 

Nobody likes rejection, but it beats the alternative : You not moving on and pining for someone who is not into you. Imagine this drags on for years, without any of you making a move?

It is no failure to be brave enough to ask people out. Think about your friendship, is it actually honest if you don't disclose that you have romantic feeling for her?

If it doesn't work out you are free from this anxiety. If it does you get a gf!

Best of luck"
amiugly,f734c4p,t3_dua0sp,1573387555.0,"shit, I'm sorry for all of the ugly, vile people you had to deal with.

Your facial features are average. Definitely not ugly.

I really don't like your hair in some of the pictures, but I really don't know the first about cut/styling on curly hair."
stopsmoking,f731zzo,t3_du8s5s,1573386519.0,"When I quit I was always hungry and sad/annoyed. I'm about two and half months in and my appetite is almost normal. Still eat a bit more sometimes, but that's to be expected. 

This is temporary discomfort. In a few days you will feel much better. Best of luck ‚ò∫"
