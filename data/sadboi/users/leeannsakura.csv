Then in school one of the dorm advisors noticed I was never eating till the point of passing out. I missed getting cafeteria food because I was off center all day, so I would miss lunch and dinner. The school gave me money for food (about $40 a week) but as I had no family I would save it for my phone bill and feminine hygiene stuff. The RA start buying big lunches and saving me the half. I have a friend now who I would buy food for multiple times throughout the week because she was broke. When me and my ex moved in together I didn’t have any money left and my best friend bought me groceries for the week.

1) how often are OP and his girlfriend going out to eat and he’s picking up the tab for her

2) is there a reason OP girlfriend has never offered helped Emily pay?

Pain does tend to tire people out so whether she meant medically passed out or just slept both or understandable. Also I don’t think her falling asleep is really a big issue here the focus is his response to her doing something as natural as taking a nap, then cussing at her, then trying to guilt her by bringing up her dead mom.

We don’t know WHY Emily is so broke, and it would help to know how the three of them come to the conclusion to go out to eat every time. I had a friend who was struggling because of trying to juggle paying for school and living on her own, but when we hung out I’d want to go out to eat.

But every time he would act like I was the issue, not the things he’d say or do. I’d say that although right now it may seem like this isn’t a big issue for now since you described her as everything else being fine in your relationship it starts to take a toll. Since she can’t fundamentally understand your feelings, nor does it seem like she cares to try, she’ll keep saying things that cross your boundaries.

AmItheAsshole,fefwmvn,t3_eok9zk,1579067615.0,So like.... what do you when you have to poop or pee and your out somewhere? Like you’re not able to use the restroom at home?
relationships,faigmuf,t1_faieew4,1576107360.0,Yeah it’d open a can of worms because you know your girlfriend would not be okay with this situation. And why wouldn’t she be okay? Because you  are being DISRESPECTFUL and you aren’t showing your girlfriend true loyalty.
relationship_advice,fahud36,t3_e9b1vg,1576093681.0,"It’s very obvious your still hung up on her. Regardless of her intent this can only go a couple ways i see it. 

1) it is just her being polite, you get disappointed and end up heartbroken again

2) this is just an ego boost, she’ll use you then toss you aside

3) she actually does want to rekindle things, but when you start having a hard time and the going gets tough she’ll ditch you AGAIN. She broke up with after only a week of moving, which was a shitty move on her part. You don’t deserve to let her hurt you again. 

My recommendation is cancel the coffee meeting and move on. Continue going to therapy, focus on bettering yourself, and try and meet new people. You’ll find someone willing to stick with you even during the bad times."
relationships,faa1hch,t1_faa085n,1575899523.0,"You definitely need to stop doing her part. If she wants to leave so badly, then it’s time you just worry about you and your kids. Let her do her own laundry and cooking, if she demands fresh food cooked everyday then let her cook it. She planned to leave to Singapore, so she would have had to become independent anyway."
relationships,faa19na,t1_fa9vcl4,1575899337.0,"I wouldn’t worry about her fighting for custody, she literally said she wants to move away to singapore and ditch you and your kids, i doubt she has keeping them in her life as a goal."
relationships,faa0dn2,t3_e89g82,1575898557.0,"It seems very selfish on your partners end. She was the one that wanted the open relationship and blamed your weight gain, but now that you lost the weight and are getting so much attention it most likely bothers her, and she probably didn’t expect this outcome. It seems ridiculous she jumped straight to demanding an open relationship instead of sitting down with you and telling you the problems she was having and waiting to see if you’d be willing to work on yourself. It seems like you have some resentment towards her, which your not wrong for i would honestly feel the same. The issue bow, is how much do you love your partner? This is most likely going to be the end of your relationship if nothing is done, you can either close the relationship and go to couples therapy or let it end and continue to enjoy your new found sexual freedom."
relationship_advice,f9v3i9o,t3_e72e9o,1575662490.0,"She seriously accused you of cheating on her 16 year old sister? Yikes. You definitely did the right thing for calling things off. My advice is to move on, but if you do decide to try and works things out i think a big wedding ceremony should be off the table. Maybe something small, and you definitely should have a say in whats going on."
relationship_advice,f9v3199,t1_f9ux1j5,1575662250.0,I really wouldn’t be surprised if the sister is getting blamed and bullied at all tbh
relationships,f9mnnyk,t3_e5sz2r,1575465726.0,"Honestly I recently went through the same thing with my ex. It got to the point where he would hold it over my head as “i have to keep you together everything something minor happens” and “you need to learn to be more self reliant.” Which would piss me off to no end because I’ve basically been on my own since i was 18, the only person I’ve ever been able to rely on is myself. I say sit down and talk about it with him, but at the end of the day it just comes down to him not being able to provide emotional support when things happen. If he’s upset that you talk about such minor things in your life, what’s going to happen in the future when bigger issues arise? You’ll basically just have to keep everything in, and that’s not right. You should always feel comfortable talking to your partner without feeling judged or put down."
relationship_advice,f9g923u,t1_f9g8jjd,1575295468.0,"Yeah i mean i get you. My reply was more to everyone blaming your ex and calling her toxic. Her feelings are valid if your friend really was pursuing you like that. Try your best to fix things, but if things do work out you need to take this as a learning lesson. While there are people that get jealous out of insecurities there are times your partners can tell when others have shady intentions. Talking with your ex about why she felt jealous and threatened by your friendship would have helped gain more insight, and there’s nothing wrong with putting space between someone who challenges your relationships peace."
relationship_advice,f9g80ep,t1_f9g36ut,1575294948.0,I mean that perfectly explains why your girlfriend feels insecure. Tbh you should have been done something about this situation. You knew your friend had ulterior shady motives but did you ever address them? That’s kind of insensitive to your girlfriend (or ex now.) Probably would have helped to tell your friend to back off and put some boundaries down with them. Kinda too late now though.
relationship_advice,f8v56id,t1_f8ukgf7,1574859857.0,At the end of the days here’s what it boils down to: YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE TO DICTATE YOUR LIFE FOR YOUR FRIENDS. You had fun with Chris and if your “friend” ACTUALLY cared about you she would be happy that you’re happy. This will always be an issue. You can’t be friends with someone who is competing with you because they’ll always see your blessings as something to be jealous and negative about. YOU shouldn’t focus on her well being SHE needs to be the one to work on herself.

AmItheAsshole,f5kk8ec,t3_do27p1,1572265154.0,"YTA. You should have definitely ran it by your wife first. Talk to your wife and see if she is willing to keep just the most important pieces of clothing (ex: first day home outfit and maybe 1 marking each growth spurt.) explain the situation to your sister (wife would like to keep a few for sentimental purposes) and let your wife pick out a couple to keep. Also to everyone in the comments saying how weird keeping clothes is, my mom did the same thing. She kept certain articles (like my baptismal dress, outfit worn from when i first came home, and two of my first halloween outfits) as sentimental value. Alot of my friends’ parents from high school have also done the same."

AmItheAsshole,f5i3fi8,t3_dntxbf,1572210563.0,"NTA. If she honest cared that much about it her weight she would take the effort to try and lose weight herself. You aren’t her parent and you’re already doing alot by taking the time to cook for her as is, the fact that she complained is so rude. Not trying to be mean, but i was in the same situation as your girlfriend and went from 265 pounds down to 195 pounds by finally taking responsibility and putting the time to learn how to cook. I also have an auto immune disorder which makes me sick and fatigued all the time and i work 50 hour work weeks as a CNA."
relationship_advice,f5i0n7c,t1_f5hgwcv,1572209746.0,"I really suggest your daughter seeks therapy too. This isn’t healthy behavior, and the toll it’s taking on your wife is very worrisome. At the end of the day if you love and respect your wife, you wouldn’t allow her to be saying such evil and hurtful things to your already traumatized wife. Having a not good relationship is one thing, but it does not excuse going out of your way to purposely say things to put another person down and cause such pain. If she has a good relationship with you, it’s your responsibility then to show her the error in her ways and be a parent and TEACH her."
relationship_advice,f5hwzyi,t1_f5hh8ab,1572208778.0,"And how has that worked for you? Obviously not well if your daughter is still continuing this toxic behavior.

relationship_advice,f5hwiw6,t1_f5hgb5m,1572208644.0,"God no wonder she’s acting that way, your wife is probably miserable. You’re daughter is being extremely toxic and putting salt in an open wound and your only reaction is to “tell her to be nice.” I feel extremely sad for your wife and hope she manages to get away from this toxic situation."

AmItheAsshole,f55r4kn,t3_dmg8fv,1572012340.0,"If she wasn’t looking for a relationship, just friendship why wait until DURING the date to mention it? Why not before meeting up, that way she could gauge whether OP would still be interested? Tindr is known to be a dating/hookup site so it isn’t wrong to assume that’s what she was looking for, she put herself in a bad situation to drop a bomb like that assuming she had already decided to just be friends before the date, if she decided mid date she wasn’t into OP then she shouldn’t be mad about the date ending."

Also your telling me you would be angry if your wife had a miscarriage and she confided in her best friend like your daughter did? People are allowed to have feelings, people are allowed to share those feelings with people that they trust, it sucks your daughters friend wasn’t deserving of that trust and broke it but you punishing her for this is cruel."
