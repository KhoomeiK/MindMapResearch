And yes, all 3 are still classics I love."
RatchetAndClank,fmog5yq,t1_fmoc84b,1586257807.0,"I can understand that, as it lacks some of the elements that defined the first two. (Branching paths, more of a one man army setup as opposed to fighting alongside a team, >!Qwark as a bad guy!<) However, it has some of my favorite weapons and planets, not to mention Annihilation Nation and Dr. Nefarious. So it holds a special place in my heart. I don’t honestly think any answer is right or wrong for which is the best or worst of the original trilogy though. Especially since I can’t decide between 1 and UYA."

crashbandicoot,fltmzpv,t1_fltjzgi,1585479828.0,I’ve done that before and it stil doesn’t help. Thank you for the suggestion though! I appreciate it!

Btw, another good setup imo for the classic is the flame pattern with Rustland Orange, Twilight Blue wheels, and a flammable stick. You gotta be the king of the Rustland’s Blue Flame!"

paydaytheheist,fjwqq7l,t3_ff7reh,1583643343.0,"So, controversial opinion time: I actually love every Payday crossover so far. (Barring my slight dislike of Goat Sim, but over time, I guess it’s been harmless enough) And one of my favorites, also controversially, is the Alesso Heist. I think revisiting musicians as a concept is great, and I think Sturgill would be neat. We could get something as simple as the suit, or as complex as a new heist and some tracks. Either way, I’d be on board. I’m curious what others have to say."

I feel selfish, but I’d feel worse if I dated them without feeling anything. I dunno, I don’t mind being rejected, I’m just tired of it by this point.

depression,eui7yel,t1_eugkej1,1563842239.0,"Hey, thanks for the reply. Sorry I got back to it late.

I’d say yeah, I hate myself for being born a white male. I know no one else inherently hates me for it, and it’s my own issue I gotta work through. I reflect negatively on what people of the same description have done and still do, and while I don’t hold anyone innocent to their sins, I definitely hold myself to them. I can’t let it go. I definitely reflect too negatively in my thoughts.

I’ll try making small goals and bumping them up each day. That actually sounds like a really good idea. Thanks. I really do appreciate the advice, and yeah, it does kinda feel nice to let it all out so maybe I can actually work on it all."

crashbandicoot,eq4x5ce,t3_bx6lp0,1559788089.0,"Somebody once let me borrow a bootleg copy
Of Crash Bandicoot on PS1

So I booted up the game and it didn’t look the same
Instead, it looked even more fun

Well
Fart jokes kept coming and they never stopped coming
Read the tutorial and I hit the ground running
Didn’t make sense why Crash would go and chomp
On a big onion and then scream about his swamp
There was so much to do, so much to see
It was all such a massive treat
I never knew bandicoots were green
But I gotta say it’s quite a fine sheen

Hey now, you’re the Bandicoot
Get your game on, smash crates
Hey now, gotta get loot
Collect the onions,  doing great
I always wonder what’s next
For the bandicoot known as Shrek"
