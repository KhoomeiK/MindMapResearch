badroommates,fimysaa,t1_fia5wph,1582551257.0,"Late af, but my roommate moved I with me and brought a cat. Ok. We can handle 2 people and a cat in a studio. Cramped but doable. Then, he got another cat. Not just any cat, but a cat that the shelter described as "" aggressive with territorial peeing issues and a history of cat on cat violence"". Solid choice dude. 

Shockingly, the cats didn't get along and new cat (NC) bullied original cat (OC) relentlessly. OC was a 7ish month old un-neutered male. Yeah. Smart. NC was a 7ish year old, fixed late in life, big, angry chonk. It didn't go well for OC. 

To top things off, I left for a 1.5 weeks to attend a family reunion and wedding. Came back and roommate and OC were gone, but NC was ""left for me as a gift"". 
I'm allergic to cats and at that point I was too broke to care for him and too depressed. I thought about taking him back to the shelter, but he was on the kill list when roommate got him and I couldn't put him back there, so I kept him. He has helped me get my shit together and is the light of my life now. It's been almost 3 years and hes turned into a cuddlebug, still aggro af, but when he wants cuddles, hes super snuggly. He no longer pisses everywhere and gets along swimmingly with the next cat that got dumped on me.
