What relieved my anxiety was fixing the situation that was causing my anxiety. Does you anxiety have a root cause; does your OCD center around one theme? If so, is there anything you can do to make the situation better? Is it something that you have to face?"

She may have picked the worse time to go off medication though. Dealing with what's going on in the world right now and going through withdrawal must be hard.

I don't do well with change and uncertainty. It makes my anxiety skyrocket. I get easily agitated by little annoyances. When I feel that I've lost control of my life I become depressed. It's often cyclical.

This pandemic is the definition of change and uncertainty.

If she doesn't want to try medication again is she willing to see a therapist? Does she have anyone to talk to besides you and your parents? It sometimes helps me to talk to a trusted friend/coworker about my struggles."

The likelihood of someone being infected with HIV in the US is low, roughly 1 in 330 people have it. You're not recklessly promiscuous, so your risk is miniscule. An IUD is 99% effective at preventing pregnancy, often the most effective. In addition, you now have evidence that no harm was done.

The only thing that anxiety can't really explain is leg swelling. But considering how severe your health anxiety is your perception of any swelling might be compromised.

You should tell your parents. Try to ensure they don't freak out on her, that's the last thing she needs right now. Keep checking up on her often for a few days. Ask her if she is having suicidal thoughts when sober. Listen but don't judge.

In a normal world, it'd be prudent for her to see her psychologist ASAP, but it's far from normal today. Maybe they could do it over the phone or video?

Myself, I am too much of a skeptic to blindly accept religion. Even some of the sciences seem a bit farfetched. It's all theories, models, and complex math. We may be able to see the patterns but do we truly understand them? History is full of science that works until it doesn't e.g. classical vs modern physics.
