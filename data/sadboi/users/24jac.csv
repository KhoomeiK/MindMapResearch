I would go there when I wanted to get away from my roommate, be alone, and just relax. 

Sometimes having your own space doesn't have to be in your room. Sometimes it means just having a space for you to chill and unwind. 

Also, pro life tip, as someone who lives out of state, I found having a roommate who lived in state was awesome because they would leave to visit home like every 2-3 weeks."

If I were you (only if you can afford to do so), I would start therapy. Let your emotions out a professional who can either help you bond with your child or maybe even set your son up for adoption if you see that as an option. 

You can try sending your son to daycare once he's old enough. These first few months are absolute hell. They won't stop crying and pooping and crying again. It's no fun and if you don't already have a good relationship with your child this time can be hard. Putting him in daycare though will help you get a part of your life back. 

You could also just start looking into adoption agencies. There are more than enough families who would kill for a new born. The faster you get in contact with an agent the higher demand there will be for your son. 

And if none of that sounds appealing, tough it out for a few more months and really try and bond with your son. There are a bunch of women who say they hated their kid at first and eventually their kid becomes their best friend. Although, there are also women who have children, hate their kids, and their kids grow up having a shitty life. 

Take into account what is best for you and your son. Will you be miserable for the rest of your life or do you see yourself having a relationship with your son in the future? If not, maybe adoption is the best option for you. You will be happy, your kid will be happy, and your life won't have to stop because of a crotch goblin. 

I hope you find peace with your child or your decision. I wish the best for you and your boyfriend."

some family came in and got some pizza, and they wanted some fresh toppings, so before we handed them their pizza,  we added them on and gave them their food. They didn't take it because we weren't wearing gloves. 

My boss explained to them that not only do we have strict hand washing procedures, but gloves will only spread germs more. If you want us to wear gloves to stop the spread, we would need to change gloves between each order and customer, but germs and junk are all over gloves anyway.

You can't wash gloves, gloves have crap on them before you put them on, you touch gloves with your ""dirty"" hands anyway so your germ filled hands would have contaminated your gloves anyway. 

Gloves are useful for protecting food from coming in contact with cuts, bandaids, etc. Not corona virus.

2) she probably asked if you were on BC to assess pregnancy risk, they don't want to throw you in a sauna or have you lay on your stomach if you're pregnant. If you're on BC, there's less chance of you being pregnant, so there's less chance of you sueing them if you are pregnant and want to associate any problems with the pregnancy with the spa. It's all BS legal stuff, even places like the dentist have to ask if you're taking BC.

3) From what my mom (a pharmacist for the past 20 some odd years) has told me, the antibiotics effecting BC is a total bluff. 

I asked her about it one day when I had to pick up both my antibiotics and BC in the same trip and I mentioned it was funny how the technician didn't say anything about decreased effectiveness of my BC when taking antibiotics (if you're getting a drug that can effect another, your technician needs to tell you, by law). 

She said it was sort of an excuse for women to say their BC didn't work because of their antibiotics but when in reality they just forget to take it. Antibiotics are prescribed more than anything else it seems like so it's an easy correlation to make. People will forget to take their BC when taking antibiotics just out of the simple fact that your brain is thinking ""I took my pill for the day, I'm done"". It's sort of a dumb way to put it, but it's easy to forget simple things when you need to include something else in your routine."

TooAfraidToAsk,fh214ic,t1_fh20wrh,1581230751.0,"A late period is normal for lots of reasons. And periods are never 100% clockwork. Don't freak, freaking only makes things worse. 

Chill your beans, comfort your gf if she needs it, make some tea or something, and just live your life. There's nothing you can do except wait and panicking will only make the situation worse."
TooAfraidToAsk,fh20rmw,t3_f14vy7,1581230369.0,"You should not freak, it's three days. Periods are late for hundreds of reasons. The more you stress her out about it, the later it will be. If she still doesn't get her period in a week or so, get a test.

And next time, wear a condom and get her on BC. Stop having sex until you two can do both of those. A trip to planned Parenthood is a lot less embarrassing than telling your parents you're girlfriend is pregnant."

relationship_advice,fgrisub,t1_fgrhgm0,1581047880.0,"I don't think I am. I just learned the term from my psychology professor last year. He was talking about dominant personalities and mentioned that girls will most likely try to be dominant in the beginning stages of most friendships and/or relationships. He just would refer to the more dominant lady as the ""alpha female"". I sorta thought it was a term everyone used. Sorry of I came across as like an incel or some crap haha"
AskReddit,fgrgqrh,t3_f03nmt,1581046406.0,"They hover because they want you to say yes. If vaccines were bad for you, people with these complex medical degrees wouldn't hover to make sure people who get fed things from Dr. Google don't make a life threatening decision to not get vaccinated. Vaccines are here to protect you, not hurt you. Also in most doctors offices they're not even allowed to stand in the room with you in fear of you feeling pressured to sign it.

Disclaimer: yes I am aware that some people have allergies or react in some way to vaccines but that is just how some people are. You can't really stop it. It's the same with food allergies, people are going to be allergic to peanuts, but we're not protesting that farms stop producing and selling them because people can have an allergic reaction to them (Poor example, but I'm just trying to get a point across)."
relationship_advice,fgrfgo1,t3_f03nim,1581045514.0,"Honestly I have the same problem. It doesn't help that I work with only 2 other girls and I'm in a male heavy major in school. I try and dress like other girls, talk like other girls, but they always do the ""alpha female"" thing and I end up being a punching bag or just ignored. I had girl friends in high school but as soon as I got to college I couldn't befriend a single girl.  It really sucks honestly because I can't talk to my girlfriends from high school anymore and I got no one to talk girl shit with other than my two older sisters who are not only around 10 years older than me, but also live 100-200 miles away from me"
