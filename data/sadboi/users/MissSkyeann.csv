sewing,fcksfks,t3_ehi7rs,1577732190.0,"I really love this. This is something I'd pay 50 dollars for at a store. That says a lot because I cringe spending 20 dollars on a tshirt haha. Seriously cute, and very impressive as a non-regular maker."

sex,f7llm5b,t3_dwuvcn,1573843135.0,"Well male birth control pills apparently have started passing human trials, so that's something to look forward to. I'd say as long as you take more than one precaution with your partner then you're fine. Birth control, spermicide lube, morning after pill, etc."

relationship_advice,f2ym3nz,t3_deg2zg,1570493804.0,"I know that all of this is hard advice to listen to, but I was exactly like you. Now I'm a single mom of 2 because everyone would always leave me. I forced myself to focus on my kids and the things I loved. It's been a year and a half and I've never been happier. I understand myself so much better, my boundaries and what I deserve. It was so hard in the beginning... the loneliness and the feeling of being lost. But keep pushing and don't lean on anyone. Everytime you don't it will just bring you closer to where you want to be with yourself, trust me. I got in touch with my hobbies, I made real friends, and I got close with my family again. The hardest thing I had to understand is that you dont want someone to make you happy. You want to be happy and find someone that you can mutually be happy with. That way no one is being drained and you can both push eachother up"
depression,f2ykjpj,t3_del3c8,1570493050.0,"That's no way to confront your problems... experiences are relative, and what you're going through might be harder than they thing given your circumstances and factors in your life. Of course other people might have it harder, but they could also be more prepared in ways we aren't or it affects them differently and so on."

depression,f2wusf3,t3_deg7r3,1570470457.0,"The best way I've heard it described is that you don't want to die, you're just exhausted. What helps me is finding something that grounds you, like a hobby or a place. Whether it's music or a walk in the park or a hike. Just little things outside of this invisible schedule we're all on"

depression,f1c0lqp,t1_f1b4pux,1569347199.0,"For one, I'm sorry for your loss... it's hard for me to conceive what anyones life would be like if I weren't here. Your words really help me put that in perspective. I would not want to put anyone through the pain you've gone through. I wish that there were a simple way to make it easier for you... but I'll remember your story. Thank you"
