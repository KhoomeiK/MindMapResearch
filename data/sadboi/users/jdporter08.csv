Music,f7l4tq0,t1_f7l4f7d,1573832732.0,"Awesome, thank you! I'll take a listen."
depression,f7c2jv9,t3_dpl4bu,1573583002.0,"Wow. I swear, you took the words out of my mouth. Just yesterday I went to work and was my ""normal"" chipper self and laughed and cut up with my co-workers and got stuff done. But when I got home, all I could do was sit alone in my pitch black living room listening to sad music. It's so emotionally exhausting to have to put on this front every day."
spaceengineers,f1iy55s,t1_f1iva2p,1569516311.0,"I know it's tight, but it's all I can really justify spending right now. I'm not looking for anything enthusiast level. I don't plan to do much overclocking. I also don't mind getting slightly older components as long as they perform well.

I'm essentially basing my thought process on this video I watched recently: https://youtu.be/1hKW2EjMT04

Thanks for your input!"

Divorce,ezt02wv,t1_ezr38a5,1568117049.0,"Thank you! There was one day recently that I sat him down and we were talking and I asked him how he would feel if he saw me or his mom with someone new. At the beginning he did cry, but after about 30 seconds, he said something like ""boy, I'm glad I got that over with"" and then he was as happy as could be and told me that he was ""totally okay with it"" and even seemed excited. I talked to him again a couple of times since, and he hasn't cried at all and has been very understanding and happy. He knows that he only has one mom and one dad and that nobody will ever try to replace us. He said maybe one day that he might have a ""bonus mom/dad"", too.

I've tried to be as open as appropriate with him because that's how my dad was with me (also from a divorced family). I feel much better about things now, but I'm still going to move cautiously to gauge his response.

I appreciate the feedback!"
Divorce,ezqx0f3,t1_ezqt4cl,1568064976.0,"Thank you for the feedback. In regards to moving, this was an unusual thing for her. She left for an opportunity that (mostly) didn't pan out, so she decided to transfer back home after some training at her job.

As far as my ex and I, I can confidently say that I no longer have any romantic feelings for her. In fact, we are more friends now than we ever were when we were married. We've even talked about dates she has been on and other ""prospects"" and I couldn't be happier for her.

I really do care very much for this woman and I would like to make things work, but I just want to make sure that my son doesn't get hurt somehow in the process. He is a very friendly and loving kid and thus can get attached pretty quickly sometimes."
Divorce,ezqqps5,t1_ezqip5y,1568062779.0,"Thank you! That really gives me some peace of mind. She happened to transfer her job as a server at a restaurant that my son and I go to a lot, so I'm thinking we could try something like going to eat there and sitting in her section one evening."
Divorce,eww2cd5,t1_ewvznkg,1565818970.0,"Yep, that's what the logical side of me was thinking. Just needed a reality check."
