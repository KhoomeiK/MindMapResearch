opensouls3,fphams8,t3_gdf9if,1588617890.0,I havent been banned but I left the ds3 group a few months ago. I got hacked in a certain area of the game so I decided to let people know just in case. And no one believed me and was asking for proof etc and just being really nasty. It happened loads whenever I posted about a problem I had on the game. I also helped someone with an weapon they needed and I helped of course but he treated me like shit lmao. Didn't get nothing in return which was I requested before I helped him. And he kept putting it off and asking for other things. I've left 2 groups so far

And yes you can share any type of loot even in groups. I share loads of weapons with my boyfriend when we play. 

And the tethering is fine depending on connection, but sometimes It can lag in certain areas of the game which can be annoying 

And the difficulties stay the same even with more characters unless you do ng+ then it's harder."
