Everyone has frags and Wamai isn't a viable option if the attackers push early and rush with grenades and you only can capture one of six potential frags on a team.

Clash's shield has range and deals a good chunk of damage if you can't find a place to retreat to. She's not viable as a solo operator either though, making her almost completely useless if you're in a 1v3+ and they're not already low."

Removing J채ger's roaming potential and making him sit on site more makes him and Wamai identical. They have two different jobs with their speeds and I think it should stay. Nerf J채ger's gun. More recoil, a damage drop-off, another damage nerf completely, but don't take away his speed. He's gonna be especially picked now that Maverick has frags and is crazy powerful, and his pick rate isn't gonna go down if Ying's buff is anywhere in the picture. Add a buff to Wamai's timer if you want him to be picked more. 10 less seconds. It's what keeps me away from him personally."
