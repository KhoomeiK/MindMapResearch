Bankruptcy,f4efgmo,t1_f4an0tn,1571557111.0,"All I can say is I got incredibly lucky with where I'm at. Thank you for taking the time to comment. I actually did a very brief consultation with a lawyer here, though I didn't really have thoughts together, I kind of just went in and spilled all my worries, and the lawyer seemed impatient. He told me he recommends I just file and give the car back or voluntarily surrender it (voluntary repossession). Both hurt my cosigner a great deal and I'm just not willing to do it. That might mean that I have to wait a year and a half until the end of the lease before I can begin my Chapter 7. I don't really know."
Bankruptcy,f4ef0wh,t1_f4aisqt,1571556928.0,"I definitely think with everything I have behind me that Chapter 7 would be the best for me. I was actually considering trading it in and getting something else, but the fact that I'm probably $10,000 flipped in my car on top of the terrible credit means that I can't really get financed anywhere by myself (hence the cosigner). Unless I went to a buy-here pay-here place, but even then they won't be able to finance me because of the negative equity amount."
Bankruptcy,f4eequx,t1_f4ald69,1571556788.0,"Would a bankruptcy lawyer be best or are there other lawyers that could help? I was considering filing Chap 7 and reaffirming the car, but I don't want to even risk getting behind on anything once I file, plus I have to account for the mileage overages after the lease matures. I recently picked up a second job and I'm trying to get caught up on the car that way. I just really want to file and start over the right way."
personalfinance,eylqgdi,t3_cxhcut,1567189832.0,"I’ve sold cars for several years. With the advent of the internet and everything being so easy to access online now, car dealerships are in even more competition with each other. Consumers can go online and look for the cheapest car around and go buy it. This means that car dealerships are forced to put their cars online at a very competitive price, each dealership trying to be lower than the next in order to earn your business. Because major dealers earn a unit bonus dependent on how many units they sell new, it makes sense to sell them for just above invoice to make a small margin or profit. 

The problem occurs when customers believe that they should be able to haggle that price down when it is already making minimal profit (or sometimes, negative).  It just doesn’t make sense. 

Sometimes a unit is on the lot for a long period of time, and that vehicle costs them money every day it’s taking up a spot. So yes sometimes they will lower the price - even to where they’re losing money on the car - to get rid of it. In these scenarios, the hope is that they can regain the loss through financing, a trade-in, or service packs etc."
depression,ewhy8a0,t3_co4r6g,1565428826.0,I do. I feel like I have for the past 7 years or so. Mine is for multiple reasons and I can pin some of them down. I'm sure there are a lot more. Financial is probably one of my main ones. Almost killed myself last month. I'm probably going to be homeless next week. Life's hard. I've come a long way though and I (Almost) always have hope for a better life.
care,ewhxv5u,t3_cnr9gk,1565428240.0,"As a former foster child that spent 12 years in foster care, I greatly appreciate you trying to help. It is very much needed. As somebody who has worked with at-risk youth for the past 7 years, my advice would be to partner with a local non-profit agency in your area that directly works with that demographic and donate to them directly."
