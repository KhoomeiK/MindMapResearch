I'm sorry to hear that you've been in the same spot, I don't wish that to anyone, even the worst enemy! But since you've come through the hard times I'm happy for you! It means you are also a strong person. 

So thank you once again. I wish you all the good things in life!!"
raisedbynarcissists,fd1loi9,t1_fd0030o,1578133007.0,"Thank you for your reply. Well, my dad is a little different from yours, like you said he's obsessed with job market. My dad doesn't really seem to care about anything, family or job because he has changed jobs a couple of time over the years. He used to treat his employees bad and make them do all the work. He's also very careless with money. He buys various things from eBay, he has 5 cellphones, 2 computers, 3 cars. But when it comes to buying something for kids or family in general, he doesn't have money. Right now he lives with his dad (my grandad) and he doesn't pay rent or anything. He just lives there. Guess he doesn't have money for that either, lol.
There was a time when my sister got very sick and was in the hospital. He didn't visit her once nor did he pay for anything. My mom was with her all the time. So yeah. That's my dad. I still love him despite how he treats us but I have enough of this. I want him to support me like a normal dad supports his children but it looks like he cares only about himself. If we didn't exist he would be fine."
raisedbynarcissists,fd1kb3m,t1_fczycq5,1578132428.0,"Thank you for your reply. The description really fits my dad! 

I've always been so embarassed whenever someone mentioned going out to ride a bike that I always had to make excuses for not going. It's comforting to know that I'm not the only one. It always seems like it's the easiest thing to everyone except me."
depression,fctsqzx,t1_fct0e9s,1577957571.0,I'm in the same situation as you. All my friends left me years ago because I started isolating myself and ignoring them. Family doesn't really care about me except my sister. And my grades are terrible because I don't have energy or motivation to study. It just makes me so disappointed in myself because I used to be a good student. Depression makes everything in life turn to shit.

I'm 20 so we are similar age and I've never attempted suicide because there was always something, or rather someone stopping me - my sister. She doesn't know about my depression but I love her so much and she constantly needs my help, and she's the only reason I'm still alive. But now it's gotten so bad that I don't know how long can I take it anymore. I just want to kill myself but I don't want to hurt her and leave her alone. I'm hopeless."
