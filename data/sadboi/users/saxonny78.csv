Not enough saturation of product will lead to darker spots/uneven lift

I stopped drinking when I got pregnant (knew I was pregnant almost immediately because I went to drink, had a sip, and it tasted horrible enough that I thought ‘well, maybe I won’t drink tonight’ followed by ‘welp, I’m pregnant’ because the thought of not wanting to drink had literally never happened to me. 

It took awhile, at least 6 months after our son was born, for me to have a problem with husband going to happy hour every day after work. It took even more time for me to address it properly because of resentments and figuring out his different drunk personas. Then, two years in AlAnon seriously committed to the program because if nothing changes then nothing changes and I couldn’t cope with the anger I had anymore. 

He has always been dedicated to the family and his job. Never called off, was never physically or verbally abusive (has never called me names) and is an awesome dad and partner. In the two years I worked the program, I have learned to let go of resentments (it’s HARD and an ongoing process.) Because I am less angry and because I’m working the steps I acknowledged how my actions perpetuated the negativity, we are BOTH communicating better. He doesn’t love the fact that I go but it’s for me, not him, and he understands that. He still drinks. Every two or three months there is still a binge night where I enforce my boundaries. For the most part though we are peaceful. We both agree our lives are better together. We both adore each other and our kid. The quarantine has actually been nice; he comes home after work like I always wanted. He still drinks, of course, but without his barfly friends encouraging him, he has better judgement. 

All in all it’s been almost 12 years. It took us at least 5 years of being married before we really started to get to know each other.

If the guns, drugs, insurance, pro-life, hyper-religious topics were COMPLETELY off the table, and we just went with bests data for leadership...fuck. I’m now a Karen. And I just want the manager to manage."
AlAnon,fpilgqh,t3_gdigh0,1588643374.0,"If you haven’t looked up the term ‘gaslighting’ by now, here is the definition:


‘manipulate (someone) by psychological means into questioning their own sanity.’

What is more believable? That you really are a bitch who is the reason for every bad choice he has ever made even though no one else says you are like that, or that you are a strong, stressed person in a relationship with a master manipulator who has a history of lying to you?  

Occam’s Razor is a good rule to keep in mind with our Q’s.  ‘The simplest solution is probably the correct one. ‘ 

It’s a lot more complex and also not. The hardest things for me to accept were the things I couldn’t change, which was anyone and anything other than myself.- It especially drove me nuts when my version of what happened and his version of what happened were told together, they did NOT match up. I was the crazy bitch that ruined his life. 

Upon minor contact YEARS later he accused me of it again and my response was ‘ok.’ Because it didn’t matter if that’s what he thought. He was never going to see my side of it. And it sucks, knowing the future in-laws would only ever think I’m the bitch, until The program really reminded me that I have no control over that, anxiety and anger only hurt me, and it just doesn’t matter."
