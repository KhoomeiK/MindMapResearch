There were a lot of unspoken expectations at my wedding that lead to hurt feelings and changed relationships after the fact. Yes, it's your special day, but it doesn't happen in a vacuum. Is it more important to have a ""perfect"" day or to celebrate all things positive, though imperfect, with your loved ones? 

Weddings are an excuse to give wholeheartedly to those we love most. If your friend's voice is her most valuable asset to her, gifting it to you is the best she can do. You saying ""no"" is kind of like saying that's not good enough. Which you are, actually. I can see where they is hard to hear.

 In ten years you'll have some pictures and a video of the ceremony and reception, and a few vivid memories. If a band plays you'll only remember them they make a mistake. If your friend sings, you'll probably have a good memory and you'll still have that friend."

LifeProTips,foa8j7y,t1_fo99mg3,1587642088.0,"Can confirm that it grows from OCD, in my experience. Depression can totally gut the ""motivation"" that OCD brings to keeping things tidy. It's cyclical - my OCD makes me clean, clean, clean... I over do it and get exhausted, insomnia leads to sleep loss, which triggers depression. Days or weeks of depression totally stops me from cleaning like I usually would, which makes me feel worse.... Gah

It's not a feeling like ""I have to clean this pan or I will die in 5 minutes"", more like things just HAVE to be tidy, there isn't an alternative. You have to eat, you ha e to breath, you have to have a tidy space. 

Recognizing the patterns is a huge factor in the ability to control OCD and depression. Using logic to disarm the nonsensical feelings of hopelessness and obsessiveness is helpful, but it takes constant work to fight against. 

You're right that anxiety can grow into OCD - what I see as the cause is having an underlying anxiety disorder; being in a verbally abusive school then work environment for years; suffering silently through the daily intense anxiety.

Suffering in silence doesn't make you a man, it just makes you suffer."

books,fl8jeil,t3_fmydxo,1584925059.0,"Some anecdotal evidence to answer your question. I have always favored classic literature for this very reason, and it caused my writing style to adapt to fit that model; which does not fit so well with modern communication. In college I was taught to boil down my writing into shorter ""sexier"" sentences that didn't make the reader work so hard. By the time I got to law school, I was taught to write to not only inform the reader, but persuade them. Writing became short, direct and intense.

The other side is that I was assigned so much reading, I started taking short cuts - reading the first and/or last sentence of paragraphs, skipping paragraphs all together, and reading end to beginning to more quickly extrapolate necessary information.

We have so much to read today, both required and elective, that we take shortcuts and prefer shorter, more easily understood writing styles. The modern pace is too fast for the old style of writing."

The boss was beyond a bully, he had actually been to jail for attempted murder and had problem threatening people's lives with knives in his hands. Imagine Gordon Ramsay on Hells Kitchen but with actual malice instead of TV cameras. So many people walked out without notice because of the abuse. Red faced, spit flying, vein bulging screaming in your face for dropping a plate of fries or being too quick and plating a dish on a ticket before him. He'd push the two way kitchen door open as hard as he could instead of looking to see if anyone was on the other side,with the intention of hurting someone. If you didn't move when he was coming down line with a hot pan, he'd burn you with it. Employees, especially in dish, were expected to work 10 hour shifts with one meal break and only cigarette breaks otherwise. If they couldn't hack it or they complained, they were fired and a replacement installed. An overweight cook was stabbed (poked) in the back with a boning knife because he was to ""in the way"". We spoke in Full Metal Jacket quotes and aimed hostility everywhere. 

People were expendable punching bags and nothing was ever good enough. Except if you proved you were hard enough, then praises were showered upon you, like a gladiator. And to be praised by the angriest man in the world kept me going back. I was so used to being bullied in school I thought it was normal to be treated like that, so I went with it.

AskReddit,fhiv4bg,t1_fhiswdb,1581632446.0,"Dude, slow down. That is not the situation at all. Again the presumptions and white knighting make it difficult to see the reasonableness you speak of.

I'm a court appointed attorney, assigned when a parent is faced with losing his or her parental rights OR when a child is facing a change in guardians. The law states all people at risk of being deprived of rights have the opportunity to be represented by council. I don't get a choice in who I represent, I am duty bound to the law to represent whom I am appointed, whether I agree or not. I'm not doing this for big bucks, as you want to believe. The state pays pennies on the dollar compared to private firms.

This was a very atypical situations. 2/3 of my cases are representing kids, making sure they end up in good situations. The few parents I do represent are typically hard working honest people.
This client put in the work and had everything I represented she did - lawful employment, suitable housing for everyone, successful mental health services and med management. She put in the work and did it for months.... It just came apart right at the end and she didn't tell anyone. This wasn't even the end of the story, the kids would not have changed custody that day or the next appearance had everything gone totally her way.

Ease up man, no need for all that posturing. There are good people in the courts trying to work a compassionate model and achieve real solutions for families with kids best interests in mind. Don't shit all over them because you had a bad shake. Sounds like the stuff that happened with your family hits really close to your heart.

Courts (mine anyway) is respectful of mental health needs and don't see it as a detractor at all - unless parent is clearly being neglectful/abusive because of their unchecked disorders.

Having a broken leg doesn't make you an unfit parent. Letting that broken leg fester and rot, where it prevents you from leaving the couch and all you do is scream at your kids because of the pain - that's a problem. I'm trying hard to make the same argument whenever I can for mental health issues. The diagnosis itself is proof of nothing other than that it exists - what the person does to address it is all that matters.

Discuss it with your provider if you have legitimate concerns.  He/she should be able to walk you through the process and put your mind at ease. Psychiatrists and the like get subpoenad for court all the time, they usually have a plan. Knowing/making a plan helps with my anxiety, anyway."

AskReddit,fhi9tou,t1_fhi3pyc,1581620531.0,"In my head I was doing an ""ill see myself out"" skit. Wish I could have withdrawn, such a messy case. The truth is the truth, glad I don't have to spin half - truths or whole lies."

AskReddit,fhi9gkp,t1_fhi4wt4,1581620308.0,"I've known that judge a long time. There were a few looks. Also a couple ""I've had that client, good luck!"" looks from other attorneys."
AskReddit,fhi9cqc,t1_fhi540u,1581620244.0,"The show must go on. Just have to roll with the punches and try to make it work, if that's what the client wants."
AskReddit,fhi98gh,t1_fhi5y46,1581620177.0,Thank you! I'm doing my best!
AskReddit,fhi8z85,t1_fhi7tj4,1581620032.0,"1. Parents have a constitutional right to a family. It's a high bar for taking kids away, not easy to deprive rights like that. The courts goal is always to reunify. For good reason - the state shouldn't be acting as a parent. 
2. The state talks the talk when it comes to high minded social ideas, but the reality is there just isn't enough money to get services to every family in need...the government thinks there are better ways to spend tax money than the basic needs of children... But that's a discussion for another sub entirely"
AskReddit,fhi8h6g,t1_fhi5ie1,1581619749.0,My advice is to accept defeat and focus on working services to get client better situated for the future. The point really is to serve the best interest of the kids... It really is true that you need to love yourself before you can love others (or at least take car of yourself to take care of others)
AskReddit,fhi8829,t1_fhi1tx9,1581619606.0,"How right you are. And right back at you, thanks for you work. My wife works with the same kind of kids, in a position similar to yours - I joke that she does the real work since she's hands on with them, and I just do the behind the scenes stuff... I know those transactions are so difficult. I get so worried that the kids I represent have emotional boilover in school from their worries about court issues."
AskReddit,fhi7qqu,t1_fhi1fsw,1581619345.0,"I'm a court appointed attorney, I don't have a choice in clients, and I have an ethical duty to zealously advocate for their position despite my own.

That being said, I have kids and I want what's best for kids in every situation. I try not to be emotional one way or the other. There are always too many huge emotions surrounding family law, I have to keep mine separated or it ends up being too much to empathize with. So no, I'm not angry I ""lost"" - client is the one who lost it for herself, really."
AskReddit,fhi4h33,t1_fhi0nc3,1581617592.0,"I really really wanted to stand up and make a joke in the vein of Liar Liar to excuse myself, but cooler heads prevailed. We awkwardly struggled through another 20 minutes of negotiations."
AskReddit,fhi4551,t1_fhi0i1k,1581617419.0,"I think Im secretly from Canada - i apologized for it not going, asked she talk less next time, and went about seeking positives we can work with. I try my best to ignore what I can't work with and focus on what I can spin."
AskReddit,fhi3v34,t1_fhhzhbr,1581617272.0,"I know, it's awful people in your situation can't get appointed attorneys. It really is a gap in the law that allows those who can afford an attorney greater access to their family/kids than people who can't. A miscarriage of justice, as they say."
AskReddit,fhi3kky,t1_fhhzg1v,1581617120.0,"Yes same idea, but I'm in a civil not a criminal court and I do more than defense. If you make less than a certain amount of money you qualify."
AskReddit,fhi3a0g,t1_fhhz686,1581616965.0,"Never, wink wink. I'm a dad of two young kids, more than anything I want all kids to know safety, security, consistency, kindness and love. I try to go forward with the belief all parents can get it together. Naive, yes, but the alternative is soul crushing cynicism."
AskReddit,fhi2qoz,t1_fhhy1qm,1581616658.0,"In the eyes of the law everyone who is in jeopardy of losing their rights has the right to counsel. Parents have a right to a family... I'm appointed by the court, so I don't have a choice. Believe me, I don't like it and it's not about the pay check. I'm   not going to burn the midnight oil to win this type of case, a lot goes unsaid between attorneys/courts - they know what type of clients these are and what really matters (the kids) 

But I have to honor the law and give some sort of representation, if I don't take these cases then it becomes about the money and not about the law. Kinda like a Daredevil thing... Without being blind, or good at martial arts, or that good looking."
AskReddit,fhi2bvx,t1_fhhx1td,1581616430.0,"Yup. I thought Liar Liar was funny as a teen, down right hilarious as an attorney."
AskReddit,fhi27z2,t1_fhhwd03,1581616368.0,"I suppose it is. Lots of meds come with a laundry list of nasty side effects, which leads to more meds. Especially if they are new to services - it's a trial and error process to see what meds work best with each person's brain. Their can be big shifts when they are fine tuning dosage.
Sometimes a triggering event makes meds necessary and getting some distance in time from those events can lessen the need. 
I get why people want to get off, but it's a process and sometimes not for the best, unfortunately."
AskReddit,fhi1xjs,t1_fhhvv0y,1581616205.0,"Indeed, and all the professionals involved with the case know that.... It was a messy point of contention in the case with some strange accusations."
AskReddit,fhi1lez,t1_fhhv20e,1581616016.0,"Lol, wow! Thanks for proving the point, huh."
