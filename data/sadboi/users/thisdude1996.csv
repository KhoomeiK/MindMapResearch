I've also felt like an outsider unable to connect emotionally to other people, I've questioned concepts of love and happiness, I don't think I've ever felt them at all. Feel shame for not loving the people I'm supposed to love. Also, I don't feel like I take any decision, I'm just following a rigid path to who knows where. The good thing is, I've learned a lot through this crisis. It's okay to feel sad, to feel like an alien, to feel fear. Give yourself the opportunity to take these feelings as the gateway to selfknowledge. Our pride tells us a lot of things, that we're not worthy of love, that we're fools if we ever feel close to someone. But if you listen closely to yourself, you'll find your own way of living, not what your pride tells you to. Pride was built when you were a child and received all kinds of messages from the outside that made you believe you HAD to be something specifical to achieve happiness, to achieve purpose. When you grow up, you get to a point where you don't know who you are, so you get attached to thoughts and feelings. You're not sure if you'd feel sad if your friend died? That's your pride telling you that you are that feeling, that your whole existence depends on that. But it doesn't. You are so much more, you have such a deep potential inside, that your mind can't even imagine it right now. Your true self is quiet and peaceful, it already is, right at this moment. You just need to process your emotions, your trauma, to know that side of you. It's an extremely rough process, but I think it's worth to give it a try. Here's a quote I read recently on the ending of Jojo Rabbit:

Let everything happen to you
Beauty and terror
Just keep going
No feeling is final

Rainer Maria Rilke
