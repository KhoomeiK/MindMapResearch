There was definitely guidance on both our parts with what we were comfortable with. We'd been together for over a year before we'd tried anything other than vanilla (which is what he was used to).

It can be a very pleasurable experience for both parties, as it keeps our hands free and the angles are amazing and smooth. People don't need to think it has to be a violent act, when it can be just as good and tender as regular love making.

Body color is great, but I'd recommend an off white trim to split it up, yet still make it flow. That front peak has so much potential to add shakes eventually, and consider staining the wood to bring some warmth into it. Definitely do not go stark white on trim with such a dark color and that wood, you want something that will blend. I'd recommend staining the wood a slightly deeper red/auburn, not too crazy though. It seems a bit gloomy, and in the winter you're going to want to take that into consideration. Landscaping is also a really good tool. 

Looking up color schemes is your best friend, as well as talking face to face with a professional over color swatches.

It's really left us both with emotional scars and a severe distrust of people. There isn't a day that goes by that I don't look back on how my life was before our mom died. Growing up with shitty blood relatives really made me think on if I wanted my own kid around them. So I ended up cutting ties with 98% of them.

Sorry, this was a bit longer than I'd intended and kind of went off topic. It's not something I talk about often if at all to anyone in person.

As a kid, my mom moved us around every year. I've lived in campers, 1 bedrooms, a dry/no electric cabin, etc. for my entire life. A lot of childhood neglect and some abuse. After she passed, my older sister took me in and had me sign up for welfare and took it all as ""rent"". I didn't know anything about the world at all, and finally found a job. Multiple jobs. Multiple states and towns for years as I was following in the only thing I knew.

When I had my son, I still repeated it.

I ended up with a serious alcohol problem, as well as self esteem and had contemplated suicide on more than one occasion, causing several overnight suicide watch trips to the hospital. 

At 30, I landed a very good stable job, and worked hard to get to where I am now. I cut off toxic people, family or no, kept my nose to the grindstone and did everything for me and my son. My co-workers became my family, and my district manager is incredibly supportive and wants to see me succeed because he knows I ""came from nothing"". This is something I haven't had, since I never really had a father figure. I know, it's an odd thing to say. The people I have in my life now are incredibly important to me. 

I'm 31 now, assistant manager after working there a year. Finally able to afford an actual reliable car, something I thought only weathly people could afford, not people like me, but it still hasn't sunken in yet that it is not illegal for me to have money. I make enough to even start chipping away at my debt and get my credit up, plus all my bills. 

Today, I go and sign the lease to my very first apartment my son and I will live in by ourselves.

There is nothing wrong with not being around people that treat you like this.

A few years ago, some friends from high/middle school years (this was well out of our high school years, we were all in our mid 20's at this point) we're still in the mentality of high school. As adults, this was stupid. I wish that'd I'd learned from my own experiences in high school and cut them out then. You learn a lot about yourself when you spend time alone, like what you're willing to put up with and it will help you grow to be who you want to be. 

I put up with a LOT. Self respect went down the drain because I was always trying to please my ""friends"". They were not friends. You're worth more than putting up with this, and cutting out people who treat you like this is advisable.

One manager while I was there only lasted two weeks. He would tell me that they talked shit about everyone and laughed about people quitting.

I can put up with a lot of shit, but that was the breaking point."
AskReddit,eyfc1fp,t3_cwn3lm,1567046506.0,"Worked at an extremely pretentious high end outdoor clothing store in a small town. I had set days off that were pretty much concrete and decided before I started. The place had the highest turn over rate of any place I'd worked. Management treated people like children and constantly micromanaged while insinuating we were all idiots and could be easily replaced. They fired my friend with no warning for looking ""too somber"". There were many instances before this particular event, and I was at my limit. Mothers day was rolling around, and it happened to fall on my day off. I made a comment about how I was going to take my son out to the movies or do something fun. My manager asked me, ""Did you request that day off in writing?"" I was puzzled, and explained that the schedule was already out and it was already on one of my scheduled days off. She replied, ""We'll see."" she then went to the store owners and told them that I was having that day off no matter what, and they couldn't stop me. So once I caught wind of what she'd said to the store owner, I told them exactly that. And then I said I wasn't coming back after that day.

Also put in the suggestion box (which they read at company meetings once a month) a list of how theyre management style was the absolute worst and they needed to stop playing favorites and get their shit together, the day before I left. 

I applied for a different job that day and ended up getting it. Promoted to assistant manager in 8 months in a job I fucking absolutely love.

So it all worked out."

I didn't wear makeup until I was 18, and it wasn't my friends that introduced it to me. I just kind of did it myself. 
Y'know, to be completely honest, of all the men that I have had any kind of relationship with, they say they don't care what a woman looks like as long as she practices good hygiene (as in, take a shower and take care of yourself a bit) I think people overthink things, but that's how we've been trained. But whether we like it or not, the way you look reflects your lifestyle. 
No woman should be able to tell another woman what to do with her body, as well as a man. Jeez, just people need to stop telling each other what to do, period. Everyone would be happier."

AskReddit,ew4tfny,t1_ew3341z,1565117933.0,"This is the exact reason I don't let my boyfriend meet my kid until we are well into a committed relationship. Been through a lot with my kid, like moving house due to work, etc. We both still have an amazing family relationship with his father, which is incredibly important to me as I grew up without one. I've seen so many women have different men over at their house all the time, meeting their kids like he's their new dad, and it just makes me sad. It's a very delicate process if done right, and a lot of communication. I think a lot of it has to do with self confidence issues. For me personally, being a (for lack of a better term, I am not a single parent, as my sons father is still very much in his life) ""single parent"" has made me more confident, and helped me choose who I have in my life. Would I want my kid hanging around with this person if he was my age? Are these the kind of people I can really trust? And that goes with ANYONE. Even family members. My mom was with a man for a long time that I considered a father figure for about two years before she died. I called him 6 months ago after 12 years of not talking to him, and he said he thought I hated him and that I was mad at him. It actually broke my heart. 

Sorry this was long, and may be a bit off topic, but stories like yours make me very sad."
