jfc... paranoid schizophrenia is not an argument toward allowing one to act on their delusions anymore than any paraphilia is an argument for acting on it. Your position makes no sense and your response is all logical fallacy.

It literally fits the criteria for something being a mental disorder and labeling it as such does the exact opposite of justifying it.
