SuicideWatch,fjjthhq,t3_fdu78f,1583411659.0,Ikr wtf is on people mind telling u that things are gonna be okey with or without knowing what you are going through for fuck sake and telling u are not alone and people are suffering too it makes things worse. They dont weigth their words they spout nonesence claiming that they are trying to help. ( i tried reaching for help and this one dude kept talking to me he made me feel much more worse than helping) its a rant cuz am kinda annoyed but please i just want to tell that people are not the same everyone is unique some maybe able to pull up and some just cant suddenly read or hear some words and magicaly turn better and whats sad is that people here should know that saying cliche stuff wont really help and that you should tell people the words you want to hear.
