Looking back, and this is my theory, the reason some leaders don't want us to go to sick call or see MH is because of cost to the unit. I mean it could be not to give a soldier aid because the unit needs the money for every vehicle overhaul or money for ammo to qualify, or even money for food. I'm glad   I got out of the army not because my experience was shit but because I was helped and gave help to those in need in my unit.

After failing the first class to my major, i went to the va to see if they have a career counselor. The VA has career counselors and last time I was there she was pushing me to do voc rehab. ( Which I shouldve have taken it.) After that, I found a trade school for being an electrician so I can get a foot in the door. Best decision I ever made. 

I would say college is more mature in terms of atmosphere than in an for-profit trade school. There are people there that now what they want and can relate to your story. If I hadnt gone to the local student veterans accociation in my campus i would lose my shit in college just for being alone in a small but pretty sizeable campus. 

If you can, see a therapist at your local vet center. From there, ask your pdoc at the va if they can put you in compensated work therapy.
There go to voc rehab and take an aptitute test. Its basically an assessment as to your interests and how good you are in english and math. Also if you are going to college, go see the student accessibility office. They will square you away with whatever you need to graduate with no hassle from other students, from a note taker, to giving you a private room to take your tests, to even excused latenesses and absenses, including more time to turn in homework and projects.

Ive been in that boat before. Youll be fine. As long as you go to therapy, find out what youre good at with a career counselor, and connect with veterans like you, youll be good."
