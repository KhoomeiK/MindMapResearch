BipolarSOs,fk9bybc,t3_fh5dlj,1583972937.0,"I'm so sorry, I understand. I became an alcoholic to cope with being bipolar and my SO did too. It doesn't mix well at all with me and my Bipolar. Everything I just read breaks my heart for you,  for having to go through all this. I know it's hard my ex abused me physically and yes you do make excuses for them. I've been sober a month now and it has helped so much. You deserve so much more, I have to remind myself you can't change people who don't want to change. You have people here to talk and vent to! I'm slowly on my journey now of fixing myself because I can't be good to others if I'm not. You got this and if you have to just take it a day at a time. ðŸ’œ"

bipolar,fjy9bcl,t1_fjy6f7f,1583692323.0,Thanks for the info! I feel like having Bipolar in general can be severe no matter if its 1 or 2. I just thought it was interesting that it is classed as 2 separate forms of  it.
BipolarSOs,fjxuxgk,t3_ff9ahy,1583683929.0,"The medicine will help a lot. I have Bipolar 1 and my husband has seen such a huge change in my mania and depression. Getting diagnosed and meds started really takes a weight off your shoulders, my husband was having a hard time dealing with moodI did inpatient for 8 days and am doing the group therapy for outpatient and it is doing wonders for me! Maybe if he is okay with it could do group, it helps being around other who understand."
