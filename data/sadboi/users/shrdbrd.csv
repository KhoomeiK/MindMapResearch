TL;DR at the bottom

I have been bullied, and years after high school I realized I had also been someones bully. 

To break down my judgment, your daughter obviously sucks cuz she bullied someone for a long period of time. That said, she was not born a bully. 

It sounds like you have really tried as a parent and I don't think you have failed, but it sounds like you may be out of touch if you didn't realize she was expressing some sort of negative emotion towards her target/victim for this long. 

That said, this punishment falls into the same trap that hundreds of thousands of parents have also fallen victim to. By banning her from parties and prom, it is highly unlikely you will teach her the lesson you want to teach her. It is likely you will just be encouraging her to get better at hiding her mistakes. The chain of events is (1) she bullied someone (2) the bullying was discovered and presented to you (3) you took away her ability to socialize and engage in what is seen culturally as a very important life milestone. 

""You can't go out at night"" doesn't really broadcast the message of ""and because you can't go out, doesn't that show you why you should be nice to people"". 

I don't know what the right punishment would be, but a good start might be doing some community service on the weekends and she has to come with you and participate. If she does this for X hours or X weeks/months and at the end she has a conversation with you about what she learned, then *maybe* she can go to prom and start going back to parties. 

I would very strongly suggest that you see this as an opportunity for rehabilitation rather than punishment. Punishment teaches people to lie better and resent. Rehabilitation gives you an opportunity to teach a lesson. 


TL;DR - she sucks for bullying, but I lean away from NTA because this is a quick, easy, and likely ineffective punishment"
