I read Harry Potter so I could read fanficton of it, because I quickly figured out the movies were not enough to understand them. Best decision of my life.

I watched Haikyuu, Free!, Yuri on Ice, and plenty of other anime just to read fanfiction of it. And I watched Boku no Hero Academia because a writer I loved started writing for it and I wanted to read alllll her stories.

And I watched the mess that is Miraculous Ladybug just so I can fill my craving for secret identity romance.

I tried doing the popular thing once, and while it did get me attention, it only exacerbated my own imposter syndrome, so I feel developing and reinforcing your own style is more important than going for a something popular that just isn't you. And you have a very defined style already :)

As for same-face syndrome, you're far from it. Your faces could do with a bit of variety maybe, but I don't mean the shapes and colors and stuff. Noses are usually the ones who suffer from always being identical, but you do a lot of different types that really fit each character! I mean variety in the expressions, I guess -- eyebrows can be very expressive, and yours seem to be always doing the same thing. I think it's really cute the way you draw mouths, though \^\^ The mouths are similar, but in that case I think it's more about personal style and not something you need to change unless you feel like it.

The body poses are a little awkward at times. I had a teacher who remarked how many of his students loved drawing faces and hated drawing bodies, haha. He recommended ""gesture drawing"" for that, which helped for me way more than studying anatomy ever did.

HPfanfiction,fqnl295,t3_gjvp6m,1589496781.0,"In terms of personality, canon!Harry can be pretty boring, which is why many stories will have him feel OOC somewhat. But his *situation* is unique. He is many things:

* horcrux     
* orphan     
* chosen one     
* leader     
* symbol of hope     
* Lily and James's first child     
* good at DADA     
* owner of The invisibility cloak     
* Master of Death (possibly)     
* green-eyed     
* Ron and Hermione's friends     
* good at Quidditch     
* Sirius Black's godson     
* a Gryffindor     
* a boy     
* a person whose name is Harry Potter     
* etc.     

You can change some of those things and still have him be the character ""Harry Potter"", but there's a point where he becomes unrecognizable, and that point is different for every reader. For some, as long as his name is still Harry, anything else goes (but change his name to, say, Hadrian, and they won't even touch it). For me, I get iffy whenever he's not James and Lily's son, no matter how well-written and in character he is.

So some people will think it's cool to make him a girl, or a Slytherin, or Snape's son, etc. Gender is just one of many aspects of Harry Potter.

Edit: some formatting. But also, forgot to say, my favorite fem!Harry is Harriet from The Pureblood Pretense, whose genderbend has a very clear purpose in the story, as it is a fusion with Alanna the Lioness (a book where Alanna, wanting to be a knight, pretends to be a boy), as Harriet trades places with her *male* cousin, which causes lots of shenanigans and complications :)"

And yet, one of my favorite fanfiction is a Self-Insert! *And yet*, I was reading a great fanfic that I was loving, until it had a sudden 10k word chapter entirely dedicated to a bland OC that didn't add anything to the story and was blatantly a placeholder for the authors opinions (which also had nothing to do with the story), and it made me understand why people hate on OCs as much as they do.

But in my opinion, it's kind of hysterical that OCs get a bad rep because ""they're always so badly-written"", while outside of fandom, fanfiction itself gets the exact same rep XD

Fanfiction isn't one immutable thing with set rules you have to follow. It's made by fans, and guess what, you're one of them! You might start a new trend, you might even help people fight against the idea that OC stories are inherently bad. Even if you are a drop of water in the ocean that is fanfiction, it will still make *some* ripples. Or, who knows, you might write a terrible Mary Sue going on boring adventures that no one cares to know about but you (unlikely, considering you come from a RP background so you'll probably at least *care* enough to make a 3-dimensional character, but I have no idea what your writing is like so I won't guess). *But none of that matters!*

BECAUSE:

Ultimately, if it makes you happy (and from the way you talk about it, it sure looks like it), *write it*. I won't lie and say there won't be any backlash or mean comments. There might, there might not, I have no idea (AO3 seems to have a kinder audience than FFn, though not all fandoms are equally active in both sites), but really, what matters is how happy writing makes you :)

Edit: additionally, in my experience, if you like something, there's a high chance someone else likes it as well but doesn't know how to write it and is looking for the exact kind of story you're not sure if you want to share. So share it, is my opinion ;)"

And the most problematic thing about Harrymort isnt even the snakeface, it's.....the age difference. With Tomarry, you get a lot of time travel, AUs, diary!Tom, that make them closer in age, but Harrymort rarely has that, so you get, for instance, a 70 year old with a................16 year old.

LearnJapanese,fpwyl8n,t1_fpwulgl,1588972346.0,"Hmmm... I don't know about the particular example you used, but I do know が sometimes *looks* like it's an object particle because of the way japanese use certain conjugations, and intransitive verbs. For example, the verb 分かる is translated as ""to understand"", but you use the が particle for the thing you understand. That's because when you say 私は日本語が分かります it's *correct* to translate it as ""I understand Japanese"", but what it *actually* means is closer to ""for me, Japanese is understandable"".

A very well-known example of this is 好き. It means ""to like"", but it's an adjective instead of a verb, so in Japanese you don't ""like"" things, the things are the ones that ""are likeable"". (バナナが好きです=I like bananas. But literally=bananas are likeable)

Potential (I think that's the name) conjugations too. The example you used, 話す is ""to speak"" and (I think) the object always has an を particle, BUT when you make it into 話せる it becomes ""to *be able*"" to speak"", and the 'object' gets a が particle. Example: 私は日本語が話せます=I can/I'm able to speak Japanese, but it actually means ""for me, Japanese is possible-to-speak""

That's the extent of my knowledge, and I don't know how accurate it is. Hopefully someone can complement/correct me :)"

肉が食べる - The meat eats. What does it eat? I dont know. That's terrifying.

肉を食べる - (I, or someone else) eat meat. Meat is the object that's being eaten.

肉は食べる - When it comes to meat, (I, or whoever) eat it. As for meat, (I) eat it. Regarding the topic ""meat"", (I) eat it. (I) eat *meat*.

I think one of the points of it was exactly to take some clichés and write them well (the *main* point being a fusion with Tamora Pierce's Song if the Lioness books, though you don't need to know anything about them)."
HPfanfiction,fpu6uo0,t3_gfhsms,1588905948.0,">Later, in when Dementors were stationed near Azkaban, Harry Potter would remember naked Voldemort and would never be able to overcome the fear to successfully cast a Patronus. 

Voldemort had never felt the need to learn the Patronus charm. Dementors had always been his allies, and other shield charms were more effective for anything else. However, lately, he'd encountered some rogue dementors, wild ones perhaps, and never wished to repeat the experience. While many would imagine a wizard like Lord Voldemort to have many unpleasant memories for the dementors to feast on, the truth was quite different. When he was still human, Tom Riddle had feared death; having conquered that, Lord Voldemort feared only one thing, and the dementors brought the cursed image to the forefront of his mind: naked Harry Potter. Voldemort could not understand where that mental image had originated from, but he would never be able to overcome the fear to successfully cast a Patronus.

And that -- though Voldemort would never figure out -- was how he and Harry Potter were equals."

It sounds shallow, but the reason I can't really consider him in another house is that I always imagine him in blue, and I think green doesn't fit him at all.

But ok, I could see him as a Slytherin, if Crouch Sr. was a Slythrin as well (but only then).

Though since people have traits from several different houses, I might as well ascribe unknown House headcanons by colors lol"

And I'm not trying to defend these pairings, or even say it's not problematic, I'm just saying problematic fics exist, but way less than you made it sound."
HPfanfiction,fpkja1g,t1_fpk3sco,1588695691.0,">most of these pairings are Slash, and that Slash in general is all but exclusively these pedophilic pairings. Harry/Voldemort, Harry/Snape and Harry/Lucius make up 70-80% of all slash, and that's not an exaggeration.

That *is*, in fact, an exaggeration. It's hard completely accurate data, but filtering AO3 by M/M, 40k out of 115k fics are tagged Drarry (that's 35%), 15k are Wolfstar (13%), and only in third place you have Snarry with 11k stories (9%), out of which is hard to tell how many are actually about school-age Harry with an adult Snape, but only 1k of them are tagged as underage, so considering generously that plenty of people don't tag properly, I'd say there's maybe 4-5k stories, a staggering....4%. Wow. Tomarry (which is specifically a different tag than Harry/Voldemort on ao3, and many Tomarry fics have them both at the same age) only has 3k stories. Harry/Lucius and Harry/Voldemort don't even appear on the top 10.

And you know what? If you're against slash because you just don't like slash, that's fine, but if you're against slash because you're against pedophilia, then yes, that's a bit homophobic of you. On AO3, 5% of M/F fics are tagged underage, compared to 6% of M/M fics. It just looks like there's so much more because there's more slash *in numbers*.

And that's what tags are for. To filter out content you don't want. The golden rule of fanfiction: don't like it, don't read it, and the back button is right there."
