Rather, the purpose of lockdown is to give the country time to build the health care capacity to handle the massive spike in hospitalizations when restrictions are inevitably lifted.

That wasn't the question. The question was in US history. But it's irrelevant, because the claim that Christians are, as a class, persecuted in the United States today is beyond absurd. Christians in the US are among the most privileged religionists in world history. They are not now nor have they ever been in the US systematically persecuted as a class.  

> Beacuse a member of the LGBT+ community can basically shut down almost any Christian store simply by the Christian owners refuseing (within their full right) to support homosexual actions.

This is false. You are mischaracterizing laws that protect homosexuals from discrimination. No Christian in the US has ever been made to ""support homosexual actions."" 

But it is irrelevant anyway. While some states do protect homosexuals from discrimination in housing, commerce, and public accommodations, **all** states **and** the federal government protect Christians from discrimination in housing, commerce, and public accommodations. 

So even accepting your faulty premise as true, a Christian anywhere in the country can likewise shut down almost any homosexual store simply by the homosexual refusing to support Christian actions. By contrast, the ability of homosexuals to shut down Christian stores is only possible in a minority of states. 

> As for the 'winning' of certin rights. You might as well replace Christian with straight people because when did heterosexuals 'win' the right to to those questions?

Yes. And if the question were ""have homosexuals or heterosexuals been more persecuted in US history,"" the answer would likewise be ""homosexuals."" You don't seem to understand that denying marriage rights, denying military service, and even criminalizing homosexual lovemaking were **acts of persecution** Christians in the United States have never had to endure. 

And if you want to claim otherwise, you should have no objection to forbidding Christians to marry, denying Christians military service, and criminalizing Christian lovemaking.

PoliticalHumor,fpbmdnt,t1_fpbkua0,1588473372.0,"You may have misunderstood where my post was coming from. I'm generally in favor of lockdowns, and I'm concerned many states are lifting restrictions too soon. 

But there is a misapprehension on both sides of the issue. Many people seem to think that we're going to remain on lockdown until the virus peters out, or we develop a vaccine. That misapprehension, intentionally cultivated by right-wing astroturfers, is what gives rise to the lockdown protests we're seeing. 

And it puts pro-lockdown people on the *wrong side* of the discussion. We *cannot* remain locked down until we develop herd immunity or a vaccine, unless we get *very* lucky, and develop a vaccine *very* soon. It's just not economically possible to keep people locked down for a year and a half or more. If it's a choice between ending lockdown now, and staying on lockdown for 18 months or more, it **is** far better to end it now. 

But that's not the real choice. From the beginning, the purpose of lockdown was *always* to build up health care capacity, with the expectation that lockdowns would be lifted after maybe 1-3 months. In that time, we should be adding hospital beds, building ventilators, and researching medicines that can alleviate symptoms of COVID-19, even if they can't outright cure it."
PoliticalHumor,fpbhcql,t1_fpayujj,1588470031.0,"Couple of small points here:

1) We're going to get herd immunity anyway. It's just a question of whether tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands die in the process. He opts for hundreds of thousands because he wants to make more money. 

2) (Almost) everyone being exposed to the virus is inevitable too. Lockdown and social distancing isn't about waiting until the virus peters out. It won't. It's about building the health care capacity to handle it when we inevitably lift lockdowns, and (almost) everyone gets exposed to the virus."
