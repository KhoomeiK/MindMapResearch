I did really good not leaving any in her reach for weeks. I was cleaning my room and found a box of tissues between the wall and nightstand. Now... maybe a hungry bear broke into my downtown, third floor secure apartment building. Anything is possible, right? But *something* with claws and teeth tore at that box and shredded the tissues. About half the box was gone. I am pretty sure that I had used a couple tissues then the box fell. 

One really good habit she has is that she hates the squeaky toys. Within 10 minutes of having a new toy, she rips the squeak box out of it, without destroying the toy!"
