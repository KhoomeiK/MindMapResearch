EDAnonymous,fqfftwj,t1_flh9vnr,1589324131.0,I relate on another level with your feelings of jealousy :(
mentalillness,fqeo1de,t3_gia3x8,1589310750.0,"Hey, I completely understand how you feel. 
But firstly you should know that your inability to communicate effectively with others is caused by your anxiety, not you as an individual. 
You have to separate yourself from your anxiety and remember that it’s tricking your brain into believing that you’re incapable of having “normal” social interactions - which I’m sure is not true. 
As for tackling this issue, I think you should approach it the way any anxiety-related problem should be approached, by breaking it down into a smaller, more doable task. Start by engaging in one social interaction a day, even if it’s very scary and difficult for you.  
Perhaps once you’ve accomplished that task, you can record it in a journal to show yourself that you can do it, despite the lies your anxiety is filling in your head! 

If you feel stuck or “blank” during conversations with other people, a good trick is to start asking them questions about themselves or their lives. Most people are very self-absorbed and would love the opportunity to talk about their lives to someone who is willing to listen. 
The next step would be to be an active and engaged listener but try directing the conversation towards the person you’re talking to, first. 

Once you gather a little bit of confidence, or if the person you’re talking to finishes sharing information about themselves, you can perhaps keep the conversation going by mentioning or sharing something interesting you saw/read/observed throughout your day. This will (usually) prompt the other person to ask about it and your conversation could continue, and potentially divert towards other topics as well. 

I know this may seem impossible now, but try  not to overthink your every single detail about your social interactions, before and after having them. 
That will most likely deter you. Just jump right into the conversation without thinking too deeply  about whether you’re saying the “right” thing or reacting in the “right” manner. 

I would also advise you to talk to people who have a more calm and relaxed aura - if you’re starting the conversation first. Go with your gut feeling and pick the people who you feel have a more easygoing vibe. 
Remember your end goal: the freedom to interact “normally” with people without feeling restricted. Good luck!!"

That can be very rare, especially when, in most cases even your own family can’t or won’t try to understand what you’re going through! Hope you’re both able to help each other heal by being the support system you both need! Sending you good vibes!"
eating_disorders,flluxa1,t1_fllbha8,1585268255.0,"Aw girl, I’m so sorry you feel triggered by her. If you feel like she’s not the right person to guide you through recovery, perhaps try and find someone else who will understand you and your needs better. 
Maybe also speak to your nutritionist about how her language can be triggering for you and regressive for your recovery and mental well-being. 
Also hope you’re really proud of yourself for beginning to be able to eat what you want! That is a huge step towards getting better! Hope you’re okay and manage to sort out your triggers. 
You don’t deserve to feel unhealthy for eating a bar of chocolate or slice of cake , especially at this vulnerable stage of recovery. 
I truly hope that one day, when you eat dessert (in the future), you can enjoy it without guilt and shame."
eating_disorders,fllti55,t1_fljqjmm,1585267419.0,"Hey, thank you SO much for your detailed reply! You’re right, it is very hard. Especially,  because this friendship means a lot to me, and it would genuinely be depressing if I was to lose it due to my ED. 
I know my ED brain is switched on when I have the urge to know exactly how she’s eating so I can eat less than her. But it’s so difficult to stop this urge, and stop my friend from sharing her eating patterns, because I feel like it somehow gives me the “upper hand”. 

There’s a part of me that feels like she knows what she’s doing when she confides in me about her disordered eating.
She’ll say things like “I’m sorry if this triggering for you”, or “Did I trigger you by mentioning this, I’m so sorry....”
So far, I’ve white-lied and said that it doesn’t trigger me, and that she should share how she’s feeling if that makes her feel better. 

But, after she complains about how she feels like she’s becoming obsessive - after describing her strong urges to constantly exercise and barely eat, I tend to urge her to see someone about her issues. However, she’ll respond by saying something like - “but I’m fine, I’m okay”, or “it’s okay girl, don’t worry too much”. When she says she’s fine and doesn’t need help, after complaining to me about her difficulties with eating and exercising, and poor body image, I get so frustrated and frankly, angry. Do you think this is the competitive side of her ED, that’s trying to one up me? Or is my ED over analyzing this and trying to justify my frustrations? Thank you for understanding and replying :)"

MDMA,esb4n84,t1_ersbnvo,1561778025.0,"Wow. That’s crazy. I’m 5’0, weigh around a 100lbs, and I dose about 240 / 250 mg as the initial dose and re-dose randomly throughout the night as the effects wear off. I like to get absolutely off my tits lol.  
My comedowns can be either be being very emotional at the tiniest things (which I don’t really mind) or a sinking feeling of sadness (which I really dislike). My comedowns also usually hit a full day after I’ve taken the MD or pills. Before the comedowns hit I usually get the afterglow, especially if the trip has been really good. The best way to avoid comedowns imo is just sleep as much as you can throughout the day, or spending the day watching stupid comedies on Netflix lol."
