He stole his moms credit card and let her think it was me when I was actually in another state. She threatened me and publicly slammed me on his fb. I didn't deserve to be treated the way he did and you don't either. He lied to me so many times, I couldn't believe a word he said any more. I got tired of bailing him out and feeling like I'm just there to mother him. I loved him, but in this situation, I could tell he wasn't going to get help.

Feel free to message me if you need any other help. You‚Äôre so brave for reaching out and I can see your strength.
