I didn't have to play the game to know they didn't even have basic sims functions like ghosts, terrain tools, burglars,  and even freaking pools. These are just small examples to the many issues the game had on release back in the day. Also, I wouldn't have even needed 15 minutes to see that the game lacked all those features.

> Friend Trade - Is the worst sin of all. This is the most inane and chock full of stupid functionality on this app. You have a friend trade limit of 10 per day. What? GF are you kidding me right now? Why do I have a Friend Trade limit? Why am I limited in my ability to help my friends complete their national dex? I payed 17$ to get mad. Even worse than the limit, Friend Trade only works if you're in the same room as your friend. This right here, is the most regressive aspect of trading. GF really couldn't have bungled this up worse if they tried. It is impossible to trade non-Galar dex Pokemon to your friends who live even one city over, much less a continent. But don't worry, GF said that people were incorrect when they called Pokemon Home a Pokemon prison, so it's okay.

What is this? Gameboy days? Why the fuck are they forcing you to have to be within physical distance of your friends to trade with them?? My phone has service. This is a fucking paid for cloud service. It SHOULD trade with people anywhere I damn well please. Idgaf that it's only 17$, that's 17$ for a completely bullshit app that doesn't do what it should."

What part of, they lied, are you not understanding? Because you even compare it to other companies who have literally used the same tactics. ""Oh we didn't do this because we did X instead."" And then X is no where to be found in the game. Yet said companies still charge full price and people still buy it. It's the same thing happening here. People are not upset that they told us no national dex, people are upset that their REASON for doing so was a lie. One of the reasons I paid 60$ for this game because they told me it would look better and have better animations than the previous versions. From what I can tell from playing it, that is not the case and was false advertisement. The main reason I bought this game was to see for myself if the criticisms were true and many are valid. It sucks that one our favorite franchises decided to take the same route as other greedy developers, it really does. People have the right to complain when their product has issues, and people still can enjoy the game as well. If you enjoy it, more power to you. I can say I ""enjoy"" it because it's a pokemon game.
