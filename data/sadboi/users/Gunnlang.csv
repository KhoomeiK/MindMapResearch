Advice,fr4ydnf,t3_gmpi0r,1589899204.0,"The thing is, you can't really help someone who feels this way. You can be there for them and everything, but it's up to the person to change how they are feeling. I say this as someone who has been there and done that. All the people I ranted to at the time and while I was thankfully people put up with my shit. It also didn't do much, longterm for me. Until I made my mind up to get some professional help. 

Basically don't feel trapped like you have to listen to them. If he also can't understand that you don't want to listen to his shit, day in and day out. It's pretty much tough shit. 

You have to look after yourself in the end. I would just be honest with the dude. Tell him while you are there for you, you can't listen to him talk depressing all the time. You need time for yourself and he needs to understand that. He isn't your problem. 

I also know that may come across as cold. I have just had many depressed mates, while as I pointed out, been that way before. None I felt like I ever helped them, in any real way. They only got better when they made the change themselves."

Someone explained it to me. Basically your anxious feeling affects your bladder. So a normal non stressed person would go to the toilet and be fine. An anxious person goes, but doesn't empty their bladder completely. Thus the feeling of needing to go again. 

Even if I have not drunk anything for hours. The feeling alone can make me go. It's hell annoying naturally. 

I would say talking with someone, of a professional nature to find out the core issues around your anxiety. Much better than just taking meds and hoping they fix everything. They always seem a short term answer whenever I tried them. Many strategies around to dealing with it."

They still may not be close. Maybe she is the only one that wants to play this one game with him. Are you into gaming? Would you play with him? Or is he really locked to only wanting to play with her? 

Really depends on many things. I may think it's strange if he plays with her every night, for long hours and doesn't talk to you at all, on those nights. But if it's only one/two times a week. Maybe it's just his way to relax and chill out. Hard to tell without more context.

Advice,fqvy1t6,t1_fqvnr01,1589687804.0,"Honestly that's the whole problem I see with high school. The world at large is asking an 17-18 year old that hasn't experienced much of anything what they want their career to be. With their limited knowledge of things, it's not surprising so many end of dropping out of uni/college. 

Just to give you both sides of feedback. I'm sure if you spoke to your teachers about how hard you are finding everything. They should be able to help you out. Maybe point you in the right direction for extra help or just give you help in general. Same if you reached out to your parents, explaining everything. 

As for how you are feeling. I view everything as a life lesson. I did a similar thing. Got into the course I wanted out of high school. Found out I didn't enjoy it, way more difficult than I was thinking. I had the bonus I was failing everything, so much easier to drop. Of course I didn't have any direction afterwards, so in many ways, way worse off. But landed on my feet in the end. 

Basically the take away from my story, don't feel like you are doomed. There is way too much expectations that people should jump straight into their forever job, right out of high school. While assuming it will all go smoothly. While that is true for some people, others need to find what they enjoy. There isn't any right or wrong way to do things. I wouldn't even call what you are doing is throwing away anything. You gave something a shot, you don't like it. If you push through it and really never enjoy it.

But my first point is still there, always better to do whatever you wanna do. I have mates in high paying jobs and they aren't happy at all. Did all this studying and money spent on said studying, so feel even more trapped. 

Also your career isn't going to be easy if you hate it or worse resent it. I have been through many jobs in my life.

creepyPMs,fqh970o,t1_fqgezmi,1589371574.0,"The problem I see, is how people act in RL and online are completely different. Not in all cases of course. So while it seems the majority of guys in RL think people that do this are creepys. It happens so much that some of those ""good guys"" must also be the type to do it. 

It happens to women way too often, for it just to be a small minority of weirdos. Which makes the whole thing basically impossible to call out/try to stop. In person they may all act just as grossed out as everyone else about what women go through. But fuck knows what they are doing online themselves."

gaming,fqh6i7v,t1_fqh4qak,1589369343.0,So be like COD games then. 5-6hrs of story mode. Everything else focused only online.

gaming,fqh4ejh,t1_fqh444p,1589367422.0,I wouldn't be surprised if it only had an online mode. All about that sweet money
Advice,fqfxxi5,t1_fqfffsi,1589333902.0,"So you were 17 when you started dating him? 

Always found it weird when guys in their mid-late 20s went for high school girls. They clearly can't get anyone their own age, so aim for someone more clueless about dating/the world. That isn't meant to be a dig at you btw. It never seems to end well either."
Advice,fqdo2yk,t1_fqd713f,1589293541.0,Well that's a curious one. Online it should have happened instantly or worse case within a few hours. I know doing it via the bank it can take longer. So not sure. Maybe she should ask her bank what is up. Or where it got transferred to. No way near should it take 12 days.
australia,fqchq8k,t1_fqcg2f6,1589258516.0,"You do know many people just freak out and click before thinking. Not everyone even cares to learn about tech because they don't use it. Apart from the odd thing or two. 

But yeah, lets blame people. I have heard victim shaming is all the rage these days. Can't have just gone ""thanks OP"" and ended it there."
Advice,fqcf7pr,t1_fqcch3z,1589256729.0,Should be able too. I'm not very familiar with bank transfers myself. But assuming she could ask for a bank statement and see money leaving her account at least.
Advice,fqcb3cj,t1_fqc9xwq,1589253987.0,"She should still have some proof of money leaving her account or able to get that proof. 

Wasn't meaning to say your info wasn't correct. More that when she put it in, she put in a wrong number. Thus it went off to someone else."
Advice,fqcagke,t1_fqc9oj8,1589253583.0,"I know the irony in me saying this but, stop listening to what people say online. Everyone is different, there is no one size fits all. Seems you are more focused on your height, that you can't fix over anything you can fix."
Advice,fqc9ziu,t3_gi2lqd,1589253283.0,"You are young, go for it. May as well see how it goes."
Advice,fqc9hue,t3_gi2m5d,1589252973.0,"This is something out of your hands. Can't feel bad for it. Unless she put in a different bank number, compared to what you gave her. That's still on her. 

Ask her if she has any proof of the transfer. No idea if online gives her one. I did one via the bank not long ago. Got a receipt about where it went and how much."
australia,fqc7ep2,t3_ghiwdm,1589251684.0,"They gotta get out that good PR. Even if just before this, they were fucking everyone over and can't wait to do the same thing all over again."
Needafriend,fqc6sy8,t3_ghxlj6,1589251320.0,"I take the opposite approach. I see those posts and run far away. They are normally the type of people they are complaining about. Also on the off chance they aren't, they normally don't last longer than a few days. Need a person for the moment, to either vent/make themselves feel better. They aren't ever looking for a mate. 

Like you said, they just post the same shit over and over. I would say they are just trolling these subs really. I can't honestly see them as really people reaching out. When they just ghost everyone that reaches out."
