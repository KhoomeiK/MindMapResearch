stopdrinking,f93gcwk,t3_e3d7mo,1575058353.0,I fucked up last night. I kept strong for a while but I was surrounded by family and alcohol... It was either leave or drink... I was weak. I was good for half the night before I gave in. There goes my one and a half week sobriety... I'm now tempted to go buy a bottle today because I feel like shit. I remember this cycle of shit. I wanna get out of it so bad.
stopdrinking,f93g3u8,t1_f92yk2r,1575058168.0,Just tell them you want to be healthy and quitting drinking seems logical. Because it really is if you think about it. I'm sure your family will support you. Good luck with everything. I won't drink with you.
depression,f7p4q1t,t1_f7n2m95,1573942092.0,I'm 32 and I have changed a lot from a few years ago. I'm sorry about what you're going through.
stopdrinking,f7p4ikt,t3_dx60a6,1573941941.0,I've had nights staying sober around a bunch of drunk people. And honestly it's really cool. Being in control while everyone around you is losing their shit.. I have an alcohol problem but bring sober around a bunch of people drinking is actually very cool.
