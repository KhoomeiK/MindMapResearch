Cut out all sugar.
Cut out all refined carbs.
Vegetable and chicken soup only.
Sticking to under 800 calories per day and getting into ketosis. 

The above diet has let me drop 2.5 kgs in a week when I had given up. This is not medical advice or sustainable even beyond two or three weeks but could help with meeting a deadline. Off course expect lean tissue loss. 

Goodluck!"

I was however married to a non-ADHD person for 12 years and he sounds like your husband. The veneer of it was a joke wore off after a while, and I realised that he was abusive. It was hard because he was lovely when he wanted to be and then turned into a monster who would yell and throw tantrums over tiny things. I struggled with understanding of it was abuse or not.

I feel your pain because I think I am you. Exactly the same stats and experience. Have been on protein shakes for 8 weeks and exercise (admittedly fallen off the bandwagon for the last week or so). I can't lose the weight - I mean nothing!!!

The only thing that works is starvation with 800-900 calories a day. That and cutting out carbs or any form. 

Keep it up and stop weighing yourself. Give yourself a different goal and see how quickly you can achieve it. My goal is to do a 5km charity run in 4 weeks. Then work to 10km in the next few months. I know it will take my mind off the weight situation but I can then concentrate on a lifestyle goal. 

Some of us are built to survive famines and harsh conditions better than others. I just wish there was a way I could tell my brain and metabolism that it should ease up because we live in modern times.
