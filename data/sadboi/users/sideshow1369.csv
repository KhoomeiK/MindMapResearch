DMAcademy,f8rpmto,t3_e1r0hu,1574747908.0,"Hasnt happened yet but I plan on them finding a crazy old man named Grafton, he will obviously not at all be there in the head. Not speak much sence though always mumbling. The most this dudes going to to for them might be an eldritch blast. But we have a paladin that needs to do the right thing, and try to get this guy to safety. So for most of the campaign he'll be a drag on the team but I'm going to have him doing some funny weird things to convince them to keep him around for a while. Slowly he might make a little bit more sense but at the end of the campaign he reveals he has split personality. One insane and funny. The other bent  on destroying this world and bringing forth cthulu. Did I mention he was a homebrew (almost my entire multiverse is homebrewed to an extent) about lvl18 shadowcaster (turned it into pretty much subclass of warlock) and I built him with full intent on wiping out the party. He was basically a sorcerer who wanted more power and inadvertently became cthulus playtoy for about 100 years to the world but millennia to him. Came back with one mission but his mind couldn't contain the power and broke. I may make his split personality be cthulu possessing him but idk"

2. My little cousins that I live with and help (a lot) with supporting them.
3. The girl I just broke it off with... I love her I know she loves me but we met to late... she's already married. Was serious about leaving him. Then she had a talk, and there going to try to work it out (I believe he bluffed trying to say he'd take full custody of there autistic son, which would be almost impossible in kansas... at least when I was in the system.)
4. Her  son(2). He makes me almost as happy when I see pr take care of him as seeing her. I know he wouldn't even remember me but he still helps keep me here."
