residentevil,fn9ds9y,t3_g0a17m,1586769054.0,This is so awesome man. Seeing all the fan art across different subreddits really makes me wish I had this level of skill as a artist.
PublicFreakout,fn4hm8e,t1_fn44fct,1586641560.0,"Yeah you've got a good point, I understood the hypocrisy in the situation but I understand now the reason for highlighting her Scottish accent.

I'm Scottish myself so I think I took it as though he was taking a dig at the Scottish or something.

To make clear though I wasn't defending she's a total muppet."
PublicFreakout,fn439h8,t3_fz8xf4,1586633175.0,Taking everyone at face value in this video she was acting rude and aggressive with little provaction while clearly drunk however I don't understand how the fact that she's Scottish has anything to do with the situation.
Strongman,fmws8lq,t1_fmvehsw,1586452113.0,"WUS has stated publically that they will weigh the weights and record it for proof. The weights will be weighed and inspected by officials and magnus just like they would've been at gaints live 2016 when Eddie pulled the 500kg. Therefore legitimacy of the 501kg lift and the other WR attempts are not an issue, even though they never were to begin with."
Strongman,fmwrtpo,t1_fmvoz8m,1586451905.0,I believe you're 100% right and what annoys me more is all the bullshit from Eddie regarding Thors 501kg attempt is that it negatively affects Tom and Luke and now Novikov on their WR attempts. I don't really see Eddie talking down their lifts.
Strongman,fmwr3r4,t1_fmwl8sp,1586451542.0,"I agree, I think all the record attempts whether they're broken or not are a great thing for the fans and for the sport. Especially during this tough time."
Strongman,fmwqtjn,t1_fmvl07v,1586451400.0,"WUS have stated clearly on their Instagram the weights will be weighed and recorded for proof by officials and magnus. Therefore, the weight of the pull is not in question."

Anxiety,fkdrm9t,t3_fhrl00,1584091921.0,Thank you so much for this update. My anxiety has been becoming increasingly severe since around Christmas time and the way the media and panic around COVID-19 really hasn't been helping. Although this subreddits and a few others has really helped me combat and control it. I can feel myself getting a little bit stronger each day and it's little updates like these which focus on the more positive light of life which are helping me feel better.
bloodborne,fkdpbtn,t3_fhqfoa,1584088715.0,This is so awesome!

DaysGone,fgs6v8x,t3_f0085b,1581074429.0,"I remember seeing the early footage from the game years ago and being really impressed. Seeing Deacon getting chased from the horde seemed like it would make for a really fun and intense experience (which it is!). Although once the game released and the reviews came back mostly negative it totally fell off my radar.

However, after picking it up a few weeks ago I have been completely blown away by almost every aspect. The level of detail and care that has been placed into the game is amazing. The gameplay is solid and even the gunplay, which was one of the sticking points of review I'd read was fun and engaging. The atmosphere is incredible especially at the beginning where driving at night seems like a terrifying prospect and while towards the end you do get pretty powerful and the fear starts to subside there's something to be said for those moments where you get caught unaware by a horde or ambushed by marauders on the road. The story isn't anything revolutionary but I still found it interesting enough to keep my attention. It was the characters and their relationship with Deacon that I loved more than anything else. The freakers are what impressed me the most out of everything, I really felt as though they were part of nature rather than just mindless zombies. The hordes had their own behaviours and personalities and even the individual types had their unique quirks. I especially loved that fact that newts were infected children, once I'd realised that it really changed the way I looked at them almost as if they were still somewhat human. The bike is a really fun attention too. 

Overall, they managed to create a fantastic and engaging world which was rich and full of life. Its hands down one of the best games I've played in a long time."

fightporn,fdgaqnk,t3_el2kvt,1578387537.0,What a saga...
Gamingcirclejerk,fd9jof3,t3_ek4ljs,1578234271.0,"I understand the general consensus is that epic is bad, but what are the genuine issue people are having with epic?"
gaming,fcxferr,t3_ejg0ok,1578061508.0,"I honestly loved the fear games. The first one really impressed me when I first played it despite it being an older shooter at the time.

I was surprised as well with how invested I was in the story of Alma through the 1st and 2nd game. The 3rd was less interesting but it was still really fun especially playing with a friend."
theouterworlds,fcufd81,t1_fcuas8o,1577979614.0,"I've yet to finish the game and I'll agree that it isn't a perfect game. Although the game has so much to offer, it's absolutely oozing with charm and it's got way more content than 15 hours. I would 100% recommend it"
