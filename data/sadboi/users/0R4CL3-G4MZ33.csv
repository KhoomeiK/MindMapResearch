The idea of female date rapists out there targeting random men is a total incel fantasy. Rape is a crime for all intensive purposes committed soley by men""

women commit half as many violent crimes as men, but only 1.5% of men and 0.75% of women or around abouts commit violent crimes. it's not very likely for either men or women to rape people, and it's about as likely for both to, when compared to the general population rather than taken relatively (which is out of context).

given that you can't understand that 15,000 and 7,500 rapes a year aren't very different in a population of 300,000,000, i don't exactly trust you to understand much else. yes, your rapist is 100% more likely to be a man, but you're only 0.75% more likely to be raped by a man."
