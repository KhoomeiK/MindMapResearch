We're talking about rape, murder, and torture on a scale that is almost beyond explanation.

The Japanese saw those whom they had conquered as subhuman, and treated them accordingly. We have pictures of Japanese soldiers using young boys for bayonet practice. No, not *teaching* them to use bayonets, I mean tying children to poles to teach soldiers where to stab to either kill the fastest or torture the longest. That's the level of documented inhumanity that Japanese nationalists are denying today.

Now, imagine having lived through that, or having a relative who lived through that. Imagine seeing Japan receive vast amounts of aid from the West, post-WW II, while your own people were forced to eke out a meager existence under a string of ruthless, incompetent dictatorships. Imagine seeing Japanese today use the privilege they were handed and using it to deny that what was done to you, or your friends and family members, ever happened.

It's probably best illustrated by how the Occuria were apparently showing him visions of Reks to manipulate him into becoming the Dynast-King if Ashe failed or refused. But there doesn't seem to be any real reason why Vaan was specifically chosen as a back-up. What traits or skills does he have that would've made him suitable for the role of puppet-ruler for false gods?

Of course, this raises a lot of questions, such as how sea dragons even get reapers to eat when they live in completely different biomes that are nowhere near adjacent to each other, or why an apex predator would go after another apex predator when it's surrounded by plenty of smaller prey that is far less likely to put up a fight or wound it. 

Predators and animals in general do not go looking for fights; they'll only get aggressive because they're defending themselves, maybe their children, and their territory. The animals that *did* go looking for fights were far more likely to die before reproducing, because it turns out that even minor wounds can be pretty deadly when infected.

TL;DR: Sea dragon would probably win, also it's a dumb scary asshole whose presumed behaviour makes no sense for a predator."

I desperately hope that Alphinaud has some sort of epiphany in 5.3 where he realises that they don't *have* to engage in the meaningless debate of moral superiority and points out that there is no law stating that the Ascians *deserve* to have their world back over the rights and wishes of all the fractured souls across the shards, especially after they destroyed it themselves...

ShitpostXIV,fpx7kkc,t1_fpx4ao2,1588977194.0,"I feel like the writers are trying to tell us something by having practically every attempt at negotiation just end in tatters. 

Long before the start of the story, there were the peace talks between Gridania and Ala Mhigo during their war, which the Ala Mhigans exploited to poison the Gridanian general. 

When the Garleans first tried to invade Eorzea and failed, a Sharlayan delegation tried to negotiate peace between the empire and Eorzea, which failed. 

Apparently, one of the Scions' goals between the end of 1.0 and 2.0 was to maintain the peace between the beast tribes and the city-states, which ended in a bunch of primals being summoned in rapid succession over the course of 2.0.

Alphinaud got totally played by Aymeric into getting us to investigate Midgardsormr's corpse, while Aymeric gave up literally nothing, just threatening to cut off a source of supplies. 

Alphinaud, again, failed to convince the Eorzean alliance to commit soldiers to Ishgard's cause, and ultimately only managed to serve every purpose except his own by the end of 2.5.

Trying to negotiate with Hraesvelgr ended with him basically going ""fuck you"" and flying off, before we flew off with Estinien to go murder Nidhogg. At least we got him his eye back. 

I guess the Ala Mhigans at least managed to form their republic / coalition government / whatever, even if their negotiations ended in yet another primal summoning because apparently it's so fucking difficult to check for signs of tempering or even *crystal smuggling*. 

The Eorzean alliance, a group of leaders with admittedly-varied levels of experience in negotiation, somehow all fell into Varis' mighty trap of Mega-Whataboutism. 

And then everything with Emet-Selch and Elidibus that's been listed above. 

Seriously, on one hand, I get it: FF XIV is a game based around fights, and we can't have fights if the characters successfully negotiate their way around every obstacle. On the other, I sure would like it if the most-praised negotiation scene in the story hadn't fallen into fucking whataboutism of all things. Also, it would be nice if characters could take a moment to actually think critically about their enemies' motives and actions and then figure out their plans and how to thwart them. But that sounds like something dangerously close to being intelligent and proactive, and god knows any semblance of that in the Scions died with Alphinaud's hopes and dreams in 2.5."

Time and time again, he has personally seen magitek being used for immensely destructive purposes, and been utterly helpless to prevent it.

Cid is, at heart, a naturally compassionate person. He couldn't stand to see things he helped design and build being used to harm, kill, and destroy, but he's also a passionate engineer, so he still can't quite bring himself to abandon magitek altogether, and he does know that it can be used for good. So, his attitude towards magitek *weapons* is his compromise. He is quite willing to share tech if it's for helpful purposes, like installing central heating for Ishgardians.

Does Alphinaud then start screeching at you to take aggro? Refuse to heal you? No, instead he summons Ruby Carbuncle, takes his hits like a man, and backs you up until the fight is over, healing and DPSing as needed.

menwritingwomen,fpr68pp,t3_geubci,1588843905.0,"The great thing about this book is that before I knew about it, I'd always thought it would be impossible to get on a ""bestseller"" list with a book that has no characters. This proved me utterly wrong, because there are no characters in this book. Characters have actual personalities, a mix of flaws and virtues that are the natural result of their unique life experiences that have shaped them.

This book has none of that. The protagonist is an unreliable narrator. You'd think, if an author was going to write an unreliable narrator - a character who is, by their very nature, a liar - they would at least make them interesting and likeable. That is, after all, usually the reason why people lie about themselves; they want to make themselves seem more impressive, credible, trustworthy, intelligent, etc. But no, there is none of that here. The protagonist has absolutely no redeeming traits, even in her own unreliable narrative. She has no personality traits I can recall beyond ""crazy"".

There is no point at all to this story. No commentary, no thought-provoking metaphors. Humbert Humbert was a more interesting protagonist than this, because he at least played with the idea of credibility and charisma. Most stories are, if not aiming to be commentary or thought-provoking, at least entertaining. 

This story initially managed to make me laugh at how incompetent the writing was, but that wore off and was replaced with disgust and anger. It wasted my time. I did not grow as a person from reading it, I learnt absolutely nothing except that the author is a reprehensible human being who threw in a bunch of stereotypes from the 20th century for cheap shock value to disguise her utter lack of writing skills. I hate this book, I hate everyone who had a hand in marketing it to me, and I hope the author dies in a fire for propagating the horrible ideas written in it and trying to profit off the traumatic experiences of abuse survivors."
