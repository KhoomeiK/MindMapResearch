Are you near anything or any place cool. Go out by yourself. You never know what could happen. You may meet a new friend. I always try to think I may feel awful now but I don‚Äôt know what the next minute holds. The only problem is if you just stay home away from people things won‚Äôt change. 

That I know for sure. I stayed away from people for years and everything stayed exactly the same. I ventured out and lo and behold I met some people who amazingly helped me through a difficult time. 

I am bad about keeping in touch with people to make a friendship so it is my fault I don‚Äôt really have a lot of contact with them but I wouldn‚Äôt have met them and been given the help I desperately needed if I had just stayed in my house. 

I don‚Äôt have any family anymore. They have all passed away. I am truly alone in the world. It‚Äôs just me and my daughter. She spends her time on her computer or phone. So I don‚Äôt get much attention or interaction from her. 

I get pretty damn lonely. A lot. It sucks and it is such an awful feeling. It causes so much dispair . 

Anyway I know it is easier said than done. I hope you feel better. I am sorry. I know how hard it is to get away from that awful feeling. 

Happy New Year.

I am gonna go look it up but I do believe when I read about the last botched execution that was what I read. So they may not be able to do it easier because of nobody with the skill and drugs wants to be associated with it. 
In some states they allow euthanasia. They use phenobarbital   They give the person enough they just peacefully go to sleep and die.  I always wondered why they don‚Äôt do that. One drug and done.

Then the last two girls. They both had Extremely, I mean extreme extremely,  large amounts of black hair on their heads. The oldest ones hair all fell out and grew back blonde at about one. The other one her hair just kept growing and growing. So when she was still way too young to have long ass hair she did and it was weird. She looked like I had put a wig on her.

Funny thing is when I started having kids she was so sweet and nice to them. She did her best to poison them against me. It worked with one kid but not the rest.

The abuse I suffered was pretty bad. I still won‚Äôt talk about everything I suffered.  My thought is that it is packed away and why would I bring all that up just to set myself very far back. If that makes any sense

Btw thanks for reading all that. I know it was a lot and probably a bit hard to follow. When I am upset about stuff I can‚Äôt get it all out in writing the way I would like. 

There is this instagram account that is called Nameless Does. It is photos of deceased people who have no identification. 

More often than not they are homeless people who died on the street.   
People always comment ‚Äúoh, this is so sad. Poor thing. Why didn‚Äôt someone help them.‚Äù Why didn‚Äôt they get help‚Äù All about how sad they are that these people died alone. 

It isn‚Äôt as easy as one would think to get help. There isn‚Äôt much out there.  And what is available is used up quickly. There isn‚Äôt enough for everyone and surely not enough at all. 

It makes me mad. You see these people everyday. Everyone does. How often have you had a conversation or even looked at them long enough to actually see them. Not just glance and look away. 

People want to talk all about how sad it it. Do something!!!! Let‚Äôs do something. Let‚Äôs demand action. I don‚Äôt know how but we need to start by talking about this more. And getting people together to make plans. People ignore this issue until they can make some comments on the internet about how sad it is.

Christmas morning I woke up crying. I guess I was dreaming something similar so that had me wake up feeling so sad. So so so sad. Knowing I can‚Äôt give my daughter a Xmas meal not to mention a gift. But what‚Äôs worse is knowing I am inside and warm and there are people sleeping on the cold sidewalk. 


I was discussing the Santa‚Äôs here on Reddit with mr kid. They helped over a thousand families and spent like 75,000. 
Look how much was done when people on Reddit got together to help people. Why can‚Äôt we do the same for people who need help, home, stability? I mean this country. We are supposed to be the greatest country in the world. No human being that wants a home should be on the streets with no food no family. 

I know I am one more disaster away from complete homelessness. I already feel so hopeless most days. I can‚Äôt imagine what will happen when I end up on the streets. (I am fighting my ass off to keep us off the street). We have never been street  homeless. 

We used to live in a half a million dollar home. I drove a BMW Z3. We have no street smarts.  I don‚Äôt know how to hustle. I have never walked up to a stranger and asked for change. I don‚Äôt know that I could.  

I say all of that to say I shouldn‚Äôt even be worried about food and a place to live. Nobody should. I have no insurance. I have been sick for 3 weeks. I don‚Äôt know if the tumor I have has spread and is making me more sick. I have no clue. 

Nobody should die because they can‚Äôt afford a DR. My mom died of cancer. She suffered so badly. She didn‚Äôt have insurance when she first got sick so she ignored it. By the time she got a good job with the IRS and had insurance it didn‚Äôt cover her cancer. She got some help at the end. They blasted her with chemo as much as they could and she went to work everyday balding, puking, dying. She went. 

She died because by the time she got help it was too late the cancer in her uterus had spread. Everywhere. She had a giant tumor, a horrid cancerous tumor growing out of her neck. That shouldn‚Äôt have happened to her. 

I am so angry that as Americans we are so neglected. It‚Äôs wrong and I am sick of it. Something needs to change. It CAN BE DONE. I know it can. Like I said if the Santa‚Äôs on Reddit can do what they did the people of the USA can help the sick and homeless. No human beings should be suffering. There is plenty if people that are good people that I know what to help. There is Plenty of money out there. 

To everyone suffering on the streets I hope you get a place to call home. Comfort and love. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"

lyftdrivers,fbz6wsw,t1_fbvhrat,1577236958.0,What city. I drive an older car and I haven‚Äôt heard anything about that. I am inTexas.
creepy,fbyqd3i,t3_eeti6t,1577223555.0,This is such an odd practice. Why display a dead body? I understand her being a saint and all but it‚Äôs so macabre. Instead of comfort and peace I feel scared and creeped out.
Wellthatsucks,fbypzrw,t3_ef2wha,1577223281.0,Oh no. I am so sorry. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Youniqueamua,fbydqiz,t3_eex75o,1577214330.0,"Hay I have an idea. Maybe, instead of playing in makeup, you take care of said sick baby. What a tosser."
Lyft,fbuaatq,t1_fbtatcn,1577110790.0,Thank you. üôÇ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
wishwtf,fbsohe0,t3_ee6ulb,1577058008.0,I would also like to know. Lol
raisedbynarcissists,fbsn43v,t3_ee64e6,1577057477.0,My goodness yes. I over react about it and people think I am weird. I have no clue how to receive sincere care.
somethingimade,fbsm2td,t3_ee5rqn,1577057080.0,That is too cute. I love it. I bet she is gonna love it too. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Lyft,fbsluja,t3_ee362d,1577056995.0,Wait surge is gone???
raisedbynarcissists,fbslsc4,t1_fbsd1xk,1577056972.0,Thank you. üôÇ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èThat was so nice. I wish I would get better. It‚Äôs just hanging on and on and on. I hate being sick. The good news is I haven‚Äôt been sick like this since about 15 years or so. I get little allergies and little headaches every once in awhile but stuff like this is few and far between. So that‚Äôs good. Maybe it is just my time to pay up. üòÇ
Lyft,fbsey95,t3_ee362d,1577054311.0,What is PPZ bonus? I have been off for two weeks because of illness and car repairs.
UberEATS,fbs62t7,t3_ee6rtl,1577050760.0,Hahaha that is so true. I had them send me to the same damn restaurant several times in a day. I kept telling them to stop sending me there because it was closed. Lo and behold they kept doing it.  I called every time to tell them. They called the closed restaurant and then gave me the pay. Then they decided to investigate me for fraud. I thought it was so funny. Y‚Äôall kept sending me. I just kept calling to tell you to stop. I never asked to be paid they just kept doing it.
raisedbynarcissists,fbs4ga7,t1_fbs2u74,1577050127.0,Yes it was. It was great except for the people we had to deal with. I was writing this so late and I have been sick with fever. I am sure I have been making very little sense lately. I guess maybe I just miss being in a house. Lol
tuckedinkitties,fbqayxb,t3_ee3afh,1577029982.0,Ohhh he is such a handsome kitty. He looks just like my Pascal. The pumpkin brat diet cat. Lol. I call him so many nickname. He is so cute. Our cat will lay on our chest and when he does it it instantly makes you feel better. We call it ‚Äúhim giving us heart treatments.l
seniorkitties,fbq9coo,t3_ee5blb,1577029568.0,"Awwww. I am so sorry.  That photo with his shaved little leg made me cry. I hate this. Losing pets is awful. I still mourn my cats I have lost. It is so painful.

‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è Hugs from me and my ginger tabby Pascal."
ATBGE,fbq8c7t,t3_ee4spv,1577029219.0,They could actually do so much with that. I agree it isn‚Äôt great for a home but for a certain business this could be really cool. With additions to it.
LuLaNo,fbq7w96,t3_ee3nvk,1577029095.0,Ewwwww. No thank you. Karen your gonna have to wash that thing first. Maybe she can‚Äôt wash it because once it gets washed it will fall apart.
walmart,fbq6xfv,t3_ee340n,1577028865.0,"Hahaha. There is a Walmart here in Austin that is always so freakin gross I am pretty sure this diagram is fairly accurate for that one. 

There are always hangers and tags laying all over the floors along with human waste in various places. I have never sat my ass on one of their commodes. I only use it if I have to pee very very bad and it is after H-E-B closes. 

Lots of homeless and drug addicts hang around that Walmart.  There is some seedy motel right up the road also."
scambait,fbq4tdr,t3_ee40tv,1577028316.0,Or post that your looking for a job. Use the word desperately in there and you can get upwards of 100 texts from scammers in a day or so. I had some fun with a couple of them. I was so angry that a person would try to scam a person desperately looking for work.
Lyft,fbpfpfb,t3_ee35kt,1577020646.0,Congratulations. I am happy for you. Getting back to it after being sick and having a car repair that took a long time. I hope I get some holiday spirit.
homeless,fbp9ee3,t1_fbo8hkz,1577018889.0,I apologize. I have no idea why I did that.
SantasLittleHelpers,fbneqof,t1_fbmmxbc,1576996616.0,"You are such a kind person. Much love and happiness to you. I don‚Äôt have any little kids anymore but I am living vicariously thru everybody on this sub and it is really helping me to feel happy even though I was feeling very alone and sad for the holidays. Missing my family. Feeling bad that I can‚Äôt do anything for my daughter. She is 20 so she really doesn‚Äôt care. She is the one who encouraged me to quit trying to make Christmas for her anymore.  God I love her.  ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è 

I just really wish I had family and friend to spend time with and eat good food with. My kiddo does too. 
I miss so much cooking for two days and staying up all Christmas Eve wrapping gifts. Cooking Xmas breakfast and watching the kids tear into their gifts. But everyone is grown and have their own families now and everyone is scattered to the four winds.  One day I plan to save up and buy a house in the country and have all my kids over for the holidays. That‚Äôs the dream. Even if it is just one Holiday. 


Anyway spending time with my daughter  and seeing all these kids with their gifts on Xmas is what I am looking forward to. Instead of wallerin in my own self pity.  I am grateful for that. üôÇ"
cursedimages,fbmrci6,t3_edz5ox,1576987951.0,I hate this. üòÆ
Pets,fbmqsoh,t3_edzmft,1576987766.0,I have seen so many cats just like this on the show ‚ÄúMy Cat From Hell‚Äù I recommend looking into Jackson Galaxy. He has some really amazing things you can do to save her. First is taking her to the vet for a full check up. Sometimes cats do this because of something going on with their health. And they are so good at hiding stuff. Maybe check out his website because I am sure there are tips and tricks to help you. I believe all cats are able to be saved. I am sorry you are going through this. Maybe you can keep her separated from your baby while you work on this. I don‚Äôt know. I am just trying to help.
walmart,fbmpylv,t1_fbm4icq,1576987427.0,What is it that you do? I am unfamiliar.
SantasLittleHelpers,fbmovoh,t1_fbmo10l,1576986960.0,"I know. I am so happy for everyone who got Santa‚Äôs to surprise their kids. I am so excited to see the photos. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è I hope you all have the best Christmas ever. 

I look forward to the year I can do this for families."
ThriftStoreHauls,fbmnlkr,t3_edwjqs,1576986439.0,That is gorgeous. I would probably feel the same. I live in a hotel and have a small car so that would stop me but i would want this too.
