Anxiety,flsfkip,t3_fq8z5a,1585441002.0,"Very much so.. I through myself into a 10 second panic,  Because I don't know who it is before I even look towards the phone. Could be a family member, could be a friend I don't mind talking with, Could be someone from work I don't want to hear from. 
 My good friend suggested changing ringtones and notifications for the people that don't paralyze me."

 It's a yearly maintenance blitz from Mississippi to Georgia, Rails needing replacement, Ties swapped, Switch panels and new ballast installed, etc.
 They are called Rail Gangs.
 From what I've heard from an NS Track & Surface foreman, There's actually a pretty good guy holding the spatula on the dining cars of the gangs.
 AMA you want to know that's Rail Related in Bham."
