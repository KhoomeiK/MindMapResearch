AdviceAnimals,flaivdq,t1_flabgu9,1584984762.0,That’s not entirely true ...  youngest gen X ..were the FIRST to accept  gay people.... there are always a few douche bags in the bunch .  AIDS epidemic made us scared to have unprotected sex.   Periodt .
bipolar,erm8wdp,t3_c1oltl,1561010691.0,Keep me posted .. sounds like you know her really well .. I hope everything turns out ok .  ☺️.   If I’m going on a text tirade I’ve given the people closest to me permission to ask me if I’ve taken my meds  (PRN specifically )...  and then I wonder ...(well that’s a great idea ).. which I wouldn’t have ever come up with myself because I was just too emotional .   Some people get really offended by this .. but it is very much helpful for me to have a couple of people around me that will notice my mood changes ... and actually say something..before I inadvertently “blow up” my entire life .  😂😂. If someone doesn’t catch it .. I end up doing what I call “damage control “ or I go on an “apology tour” ... in a few days which is always embarrassing..
bipolar,ergb4eh,t3_c1oltl,1560832272.0,"She is probably very ashamed of her reaction and was overtired and switching moods or could have been having a bad day.   This means that’s she’s really very close and comfortable with you and feels like she can unleash the bipolar fury ...  before calling the police I would definitely send a text letting her know that you are not ignoring her and that if she needs and help to please let you know .    Ask her how she is feeling with a silly emoji ..  ?? Ask her who her support system is ..  before making the decision to call the police .. unless she has specifically said that she is planning on harming herself or others .   

I will say that if I’m going on a rant or tirade .. the most hurtful and invalidating message to send .. is none at all .   🥰."

bipolar,epe0lke,t3_bujlj9,1559177147.0,I was seeing my therapist for about three years .. she finally convinced me that I was bipolar and the first moment I became unstable she dumped me as a patient ..... via certified mail after cancelling my appointments ...  it was BRUTAL ...  I’m still pissed .
