TalesFromTheCustomer,fqhs4q9,t1_fqhqpmp,1589383365.0,I already explained this to someone else who said exactly that. It's usually a percent off a total or a certain dollar amount has to be reached. Therefore you need every item. You're really grasping for straws for me to be wrong.

When I ring up over $100 in items for a person then they remember they have a coupon for a dollar off and I have to return every single item and ring it all up again, holding up the line and having this person breathing down my neck, it's not worth the buck IMO."
