SuicideWatch,fpxzpu7,t1_fpwsa7r,1588992911.0,"One of the first things I learned while studying to become a therapist is to never give advice to a client. Never tell someone to do this or do that. I hate to say it but if any therapist is ever saying “you should...” or “have you tried...” odds are they aren’t a good therapist and are probably grasping at straws.

I also agree SMART goals are kinda bull"
SuicideWatch,fpxyx6y,t3_gfsv5a,1588992440.0,"Hello! I am currently studying to become a licensed therapist, and I can honestly say that therapy isn’t for everyone. A lot of what we do is overstated by the general public and I absolutely agree with you that therapy definitely isn’t the cure for mental illnesses. For many people however, it can be a successful treatment for their specific issue. 

I think that if therapy works for you, great! But if not, that is completely okay too. There are other things besides therapy that can help. 

Stay safe! Stay healthy!"
raisedbynarcissists,fowpx1c,t1_fowpgse,1588124684.0,"It kind of does. I really appreciate everyone validating that I’m not the only one who is going through this. I was honestly starting to think that I was the one in the wrong, but then everyone comes over and gives support and validation, and I feel like I’m not alone."
jacksepticeye,fowjxsw,t3_g9qnzg,1588121241.0,It’s still a little creepy.... BUT ITS SO CUUUUUTEEE!!!
raisedbynarcissists,fowjujt,t1_fowjduv,1588121191.0,"That’s exactly what I’m talking about! Another thing that I forgot to mention was that we’re expected to respect them just because they are our parents. I understand that they deserve some, but if you don’t respect me then why on Earth should I respect you???"
jacksepticeye,foggsty,t1_fofr6n4,1587752395.0,Same
SuicideWatch,foeogzi,t1_foenvnp,1587709519.0,I appreciate that! Fell free to pm me whenever and for whatever you want 💙
SuicideWatch,foenrmb,t1_foenbz7,1587708907.0,"I know it probably won’t mean much, but your problems aren’t a burden to me. I offered to talk because I genuinely want to try to help if I can. It’s completely up to you of course, but I just want to make sure that you are safe."
SuicideWatch,foen2au,t3_g72y9h,1587708306.0,It would most definitely not be better if you weren’t here. It breaks my heart that anyone would be burdened with that idea. I’m here if you need to talk to anyone 💙
Markiplier,flm9o7l,t3_fplxqm,1585277907.0,Not even gonna lie the first thought I had was Tim Allen... 😗
