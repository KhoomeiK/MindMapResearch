You can’t draw an arbitrary line and say “this form of sexual deviancy is wonderful and amazing” while also saying “this form of sexual deviancy is evil and we should kill them all”. I’m not saying I think pedophilia should be culturally accepted and socially normalized. I believe it needs treatment because of the harmful effects it has. Similar to how I believe transitioning to a new form of body will have negative effects for those undergoing the transition. Look at transgender suicide rates, and how many regret doing it.

I understand that pedophilia has the potential to harm other people while transitioning usually only has the potential to harm themself. Now, using that train of thought, why not ignore suicidal people because it’s “only going to harm themselves”? If you say that the family members will be upset, aren’t some family members upset when their children come out as gay?"

I’m not gonna defend his actions, but at the same time, he wasn’t even a teenager when his actions began. He didn’t understand healthy and unhealthy sexual encounters.
