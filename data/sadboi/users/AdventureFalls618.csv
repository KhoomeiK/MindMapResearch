oir.umbc edu/university-data/sceq-profiles

Then you can see the student course evals sorted by semester, then by class, then scroll down to see the dif course evals for dif professors that students fill out at the end of the semester. Usually better than Rate My Professor, sometimes less biased (you usually only post to RMP if something went really good or really bad), and are more reliable because they're more popular and somewhat more ""required"" than RMP posts.

Edit: oof, I hope I didn't break any subreddit or reddit rules posting that link..."
UMBC,fnlpq7h,t1_fnlesxw,1587057607.0,"Yeah, that too. That definitely helped a lot because philosophy readings are dens af. The shmoop or sparknotes work just fine for the knowledge you need to pass the class"
UMBC,fnlas96,t3_g2fgfc,1587050226.0,"I had PHIL 100 w/ Ribavichute and it wasn't too bad. The conversation is interesting enough (because it's philosophy) but expect a fair amount if reading and a handful of group presentations on parts of a text. The class is mostly discussion based and as long as you take notes well (most bio majors I've met do, so you're probably good) you really just need to know the reading material and ideologies relatively well and you should be good. I got through it pretty well because my bio friend took the class with me and she shared her good notes lol"

I've been especially struggling with it since my college classes went online and I've been trying to get my shit together. Like, I still play games sometimes but it almost always feels like I'm wasting time. I've been trying to combat this by getting work done at other times during the day and telling myself that I earned the down time and I should enjoy things more (even though I still usually only watch YT vids and scroll on social media during down time...)"

UMBC,esjpvsj,t3_c81qd4,1562038820.0,"I would wait on the waitlist because in position 1 you usually have a pretty good chance of getting into the class. Sometimes people drop because they can't fit it in their schedule or if they take too many classes, then you can get in. Like the other commenters have said though, you can wait until later semesters to take it as it's a requirement for your general education requirements but, more often than not, not a requirement for future classes in your major. You can take it almost whatever semester you want to.

On another note, I had Professor Kiehne and he is the most down to earth, coolest guy I have ever met. He is just wholesome and great. I'm going into my senior year and I still remember him from my 2nd semester freshman year. I'm glad to hear that he's still teaching @ UMBC. I gotta go visit him someday this semester..."
