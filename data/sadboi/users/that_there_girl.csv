BPD,fnv2r2x,t3_g40uid,1587278332.0,"my ex just randomly texted me last night after months of no contact (for good reason), having an absolute meltdown on me about NOTHING, & as soon as i went to defend myself he came back with “if you’re gonna have an episode every time we talk them i’m just not gonna fucking ever talk to you.”
i replied with “if i have an “episode” every time we talk but manage to control them 99% of the rest of the time, maybe it’s not my mental illness that’s the problem :)” & blocked him before he could reply. 
all he every did was call me psycho & crazy & it felt SO good to finally say that to him & get it off my chest! ❤️"
