I set a glue trap once and my dog got caught in it so that's a bad idea too. It was so terrible.  It was glue glue glue like a cartoon or something as I got my chihuahua free and then I got covered in glue too. 

Can you just set with a live trap? Almonds and peanut butter. Steel wool for the holes, but then also I know it sounds out there, but they hate certain essential oils. They hate peppermint and tea tree but tea tree can be be poisonous to cats if they get it on them so careful with that. 

Hey if anyone has a skunk problem, I have a tip on that. A family member who has since passed, owned a pest control business and for skunks that live in that space under the house, you put an AM radio and they hate it. They can't sleep and it's too much.

Im not limiting screen times either if that's a thing you do. As long as her school work is done, I just am not going to rx busy work to take up the day.

As far as flying off the handle, go for a drive! Alone. Get whatever you need done and just take off. You'll feel less guilty or like there's pressure to get home if it's bedtime ish.

I've taken my daughter age 10 with me too and it breaks the tension up to karaoke in the car.

Televisits are covered in a lot of states right now. Call your insurance and ask for a list of pdocs to establish with and also set up televisit with your primary Dr. Not all Drs will deal with Adderall/stims but yours may be understanding of the tremendous pressure to be ""on"" 24hrs a day. I don't know about your heart rate but that's an issue you can bring up. Maybe even a sort of anti anxiety antidepressant could work. Won't know till you ask. 

And as far as throwing shoes? Eh. You're gonna have to learn to walk away and nicely say eff off. Go to your bedroom and regroup. Better to ignore the kids than erupt. I've had to tell my daughter many times I don't have the capacity right now to do that, talk about that, deal with that. Whatever. I'm spent too and she has days of straight whining sun up to sun down. 

I would get in with regular Dr and explain that your ADHD is really being tested due to all this and you don't have the capacity to keep all of the moving parts together and you are having a hard time managing symptoms such as.... Be specific. 

Anyway, good luck. It's been hard here too."

The best thing you can do is try to take breaks off or at least weekends. It helps not develop a tolerance as fast. Just gives you a reset. Don't be too hard on yourself if you do end up increasing at some point, it happens. The best thing to do is always make sure you have rest too bc everything just works better with proper sleep."

I'm guessing there are much worse ways that have nothing to do with ADHD or meds or any of that. This example is just the most obvious one at the moment.

And the publicity of it with audio and jpegs is a lot for anyone but especially a fragile masculine ego. I don't think he cared much for her at that point in their marriage but it's like his thing.

I'm guessing she never owned up to the meaning of the banana pics like oh I was just messing around it was a joke... And everyone just waited for her to tell the truth on her own which has not happened yet even off camera. It would be insane to have to deal with that but I can actually see it happening. I think she lacks perspective on herself in an extreme way and has no idea how she is actually viewed by anyone in their family. She's so off her rocker with perceptions that it was like uhh so are we just going to go along with this? Well what else can you do with someone who doubles down and tells you they didn't do something they actually did? Go to MORE therapy with them? Oh hell no.

I would check a medical problem first. And don't take no for an answer on tests you can research like it may be a thyroid problem. 

Additionally dark hair looks fuller. Cut and part makes a big difference. Your hair appears very fine like mine and I have to use gel bc it's also curly and i dont have much hair anyway, but gel spreads out my washed so that lets me look less piecy. 

It's a sore subject because I was with a man determined to ruin my self-worth who would tell me I was fat, bald, stupid, ugly.  I dont miss that guy at all. I did have hormonal problems after I had a baby, but its not great still. 

I think dye a darker color is a good option to give the appearance of volume and I'm sure areas are more full like the back and parts of the side. I'd just do some radical acceptance on it. Like okay, this is what I have and it doesnt define me as a woman, human, person, whatever and here are a couple things that make me notice it less.... do those things and then let it go. In addition talk to your dr and just rule out what you can. If youre still left where you are that it's just your hair, okay fuck it, then we need radical acceptance. We can improve it a bit, but not worry about it. Its counteractive to your purpose. You have value independent of what your hair looks like.

I think we should focus more on firefighter workouts probably that are with available equipment like hip thrust a sand bag if you need weight. Unless you can outfit a full gym in your home, we're on our own and so safe, home stuff, and just doing exercise is more to the point right now. Just my opinion though."
