Also make flyers. I've helped a lot of people with lost dogs and every single time someone took the dog in (because if you found a lost dog it's what you would do right?)

So make a good flyer, color photos and put them in those laminate sheets so that they don't get ruined in the rain."

It was AWFUL. The ER nurses were nasty. One told me to stop coughing. Literally told me ""you stop that"", Basically implying I was faking. Another was nasty when giving me an EKG (I have heart condition and get them regularly) because I didn't take my bra off after she told me to Uundress. It's the only EKG in my life I had to take my bra off for. She yelled at me saying ""when I tell you to undress you better undress"". It was humiliating. 
The EKG showed I had tachycardia because I was coughing so hard. The ER doc said, ""well you have a heart condition anyway, come back if it gets worse"" and sent me home with nothing, no medication.

I recently saw my cardiologist and when I told him I had tachycardia from coughing so hard he was appalled they did nothing for me and just sent me home. 

Another shit hospital, Our Lady of Mercy on 233rd in BX (name may be different now). The MRI machine was broken when I went in with slipped disc after car accident. I also had to wait in waiting room 12 hours to even see someone. Herniation was so bad I had to get surgery. Going to OLM was a waste of my time. All I did was wait in ER for 12 hours for NOTHING.

I like Mount Sinai West a lot. Short wait in ER."
