At the risk of sounding like a complete idiot: is it fine for us to just duct tape it back on rather than guessing where to drill?

bipolar,fmn054n,t3_fw89c1,1586215447.0,"In quarantine most people are not getting the same amount or quality of attention that they‚Äôre used to (or not getting it from as many different people as usual, etc.). This would lead any person to engage in attention seeking behavior. It also makes sense for this behavior to be kind of ‚Äúodd‚Äù because it‚Äôs an odd situation where you can‚Äôt engage in whatever more appropriate/socially acceptable attention seeking behavior that you would usually engage in when you need attention. 

In other words, it makes sense and seems to be less of a bipolar thing and more of a human thing (although having a bipolar brain tends to make everything more intense). Do you have a therapist you can chat with about trying to figure out more healthy ways to get attention during this really weird time?

I hope this is helpful. Stay safe. <3"

beauty,fdcr3yy,t3_ejsaxc,1578281963.0,"Breath: as others have said, tongue scraper especially in the morning. I also recently figured out that it‚Äôs better for me not to swish water in my mouth after brushing my teeth; just spit as much out and let the toothpaste be. However, drinking water throughout the day really helps. 

Outfits: go cheap and focus on current fit. You don‚Äôt need to buy a whole new wardrobe, but having one good fitting pair of pants can make a big difference. I‚Äôve also found that flattering clothing styles do not work for me across different sizes, so maybe go outside what styles used to be flattering and figure out what works best for your current body.

Personally, when I look back at pictures of when I was sick, I do want to look closer to that again. But then I remember what was actually happening in that picture - I was sooo insecure about my body and so very unhappy with how I looked. As much as I want to lose the weight I‚Äôve gained, I can say from experience that even at that weight, I was deeply unhappy. Though I really want to emphasize that I‚Äôm just sharing my own experience; I know everyone‚Äôs experience is different. 

I hope you feel better soon. I know it‚Äôs easier said than done, but everyone deserves to feel beautiful. <3"
BipolarReddit,fcw3hgd,t3_ej2b0r,1578016283.0,"I have been lucky enough to have found a med combination that keeps me pretty stable. I‚Äôve given up the sex, drugs, rock&roll life to be rather boring. I don‚Äôt go out on work nights at all. I keep a fairly strict bedtime. If I‚Äôm feeling off, I take a sick day. I don‚Äôt provide a reason, I just call out sick per my company‚Äôs policy. I‚Äôm careful about when I call out so that it‚Äôs not excessive (again, I‚Äôm lucky enough to be stable with my meds). I think the biggest piece is that I love my career and will sacrifice my personal life to keep my professional life strong. Basically I use up all my spoons at work and come home and collapse. It‚Äôs not typically that extreme, but it has been at times. I‚Äôm not necessarily recommending this, but this is how I manage."

I noticed a few people mention clumsiness. I also constantly am bruised from general clumsiness.. I wonder if that‚Äôs related.. And the sleeping. I could either sleep forever or I‚Äôm a ball of anxiety needing to take way too much klonopin to sleep. And gotta love the choice between being depressed and completely losing my sex drive or take antidepressants to sometimes be ‚Äúhappy‚Äù and completely lose my sex drive... 

And is it better or worse that my symptoms and diagnosis started so young that I have no ‚Äúpre-bipolar‚Äù me? My guess is that it sucks either way."
