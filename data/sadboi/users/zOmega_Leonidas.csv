ArtistLounge,fp8yqyl,t3_gbn88k,1588407769.0,"It's just a suggestion, but what anout focusing on something you REALLY like to draw? I have a similiar problem when I want to draw stuff I don't like. If I was asked to draw cars for example, I would get bored after 1 minute, but when I draw anatomy I can spend hours on it. Maybe you are not drawing what you really like, or you are bored about your medium. If you are a digital artist, you could try some new type of coloring or brushes.

Also, setting a timer and telling yourself ""I'm gonna draw for the next hour"" could help you, and eventually you'll get used to it.

If nothing helps, just take a week off.

Hope it helps!"

I want to learn quickly to improve quickly, but that doesn't mean I don't spend time and effort on what I do. I focused on fundamentals for 10 months, I got a decen grasp on anatomy and gesture, I also developed some muscle memory to draw anatomy. Sorry if that sounds arrogant, I swear I am not. 😅
But yeah, I've got a big motivation, I draw because I love it, but I am also extremely critical of everything I do, I never consider my work good or even decent. I know it's not healthy, but I always psychologically destroy my drawings to not fall in the ""oh wow I am pretty good"" thought and be disappointed later on. That's why I try to learn ""the right way"". I try to be aware of what I am doing and do it the best I can."
ArtistLounge,flqacad,t1_flphbl8,1585385979.0,"Thank you really much for all your tips! The idea that I am not learning the ""right"" way probably comes from the internet itself. Many professional artists keep saying ""you gotta learn in this way and that way"", so I always feel confused about what I am doing.

The ""work on your weak areas"" is definitely what I do whenever I draw something, and one of the most fun parts of art in my opinion.

Also, it's comforting to know that I am not supposed to rush my improvements. I would still like to work professionally as soon as possible, and maybe if I keep working 4 hours per day for the next years or so, I will see improvements. Thank you very much!"

The only thing you have to do is  find a way to change yourself. I am not an expert, and I am not sure that my tips would be useful, but maybe you can try to ""correct"" yourself everytime you notice that you are behaving like the person you don't want to be. It only takes time, but be sure that you REALLY want to change yourself. I understand how sad it is to spend your life as someone you don't relate to. Try to change yourself little by little, start with something easy, like the way you talk or act.

ArtistLounge,fikfd8r,t3_f8c5n4,1582479302.0,"There is nothing wrong with wanting to live with art. You don't need to change your mindset, but you have to approach it differently maybe. When you draw for others, you can ask yourself if they will like it, but when you draw for yourself, you can do whatever you want! If drawing becomes just a job and you don't enjoy it, something must change, or you'll freak out. I suggest you to take a break, clean your mind and then go back on drawing."

And yes, I want to go to an art accademy for a few years, and I really want to learn to animate and work on stuff like cartoons and anime maybe. Or I could just draw for people on internet, who know.

It kinda makes me sad, because I approached drawing in a time of my life where I understood that art was the only thing I wanted to keep living for, and now that I started this path, I don't even know why I started in the first place. I mean, I don't have a final goal I want to reach or anything. I just wanna draw. Art is all I live for, I want it to be my job, my passion, my hobby. But this path is not easy at all."
ArtistLounge,figa45t,t1_fig8hal,1582397511.0,"Thank you! I actually use Pinterest a lot, especially for inspiration. When I see a style I like, i try to redraw it, and it comes out decent. I don't have many problems with reproducing what I see. But I often feel overwhelmed by the amount of stuff I have to learn, or I feel angry for not improving faster. People always say that I will improve at my own peace, but I still struggle with accepting that. Also, seeing others' art kinda kills my mood :/
I think I need to actually try something totally new, maybe an ink only piece like you said. When I draw with pencils and I have to draw, let's say, an eye, I often draw tons of them to find the right one to use, but that kinda overwhelms me with how many styles/techniques there are, and I end up dropping everything."

My ultimate goal is to be able to draw from imagination, but for now I know I need references and it's okay. The only problem is that I prefer to draw faces a bit stylized, with bigger eyes than normal, and it causes me troubles. I am not too sure how to draw that subtle angle I was talking about when it comes to stylization. Also, the foreshortening of the eye is quite a problem. It's not that I want to develope a style, I know it takes time, i just tend to prefer stylization over realism. Anyway I'll keep practicing and I will eventually understand. Thanks again!"

If you have a dream, you can reach it, if you feel like you can't, just fake that you can, and you'll get there without even realizing it (that works for me, but it's not helpful to everyone).
Maybe you understimate yourself too much, try setting easier goals and do your best to reach them. There is nothing wrong in being ""less"" than someone else, because we all have different minds, points of view and goals, so there is no point in comparing ourselves with others.
It's okay if you don't know what or where you will be at 40 or 60, you live in the present, you should focus on that and improve yourself now to be better in the future.
