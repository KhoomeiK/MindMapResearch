SuicideWatch,flqxpd0,t3_fqiiwf,1585408630.0,"Yeah I used to be like you I thought no one liked me and yeah I don't think anyone did, people just didn't feel very connected to who I was as a person back I was hung out with the popular and unpopular kids and neither really cared about me, and I was feeling kinda like you did but I did manage to turn it all around. One guy (who coincidentally later turned out to be my bully for about a year and a half) , told me exactly what I needed to do to be liked more. He helped me reinvent myself and change myself to fit the people I hung out with. I had to change myself to fit the group I wanted to hang out with, and yeah best would just be to find people who like you for who you are but this is not a bad alternative. If you always feel like you say the wrong thing, say nothing. One of my best friends never talks and is one of the most liked people in our friend circle. Just be a good person, help others when they need it. That's what I did. I did things for other people and if they were good people they would do things back for me. People that 2 years ago wouldn't have given two hoots about me now made a group and helped me when they found out I was suicidal and that really is the true show of friendship. I know it seems hard right now to find friends but just try your best to do things for people. Be nice to people. And the good friends will do things back."

If someone asked you how to kill themself and you told them and they died, you would feel bad even if you tell yourself you helped that guys pain ease. Right? So don't ask this question cause unfortunately someones death as a direct result of an action you performed is not something most people can handle"

SuicideWatch,fi6qw3j,t1_fi6lwnq,1582204999.0,That's a horrible thing to do of course but sometimes it's real and it really does hurt. I think that OP should only do what his gf would do for him if they swapped roles. If his gf would sacrifice everything for him then I feel like he should be willing to do the same for her. It's a give and take it's a two way street one day OP will need her and he'll be glad he helped her out because she'll (should) be there for him. Sometimes it's not about you it's about those around you and sometimes you gotta give up for others cause eventually they will end up giving up for you. Of course all this isn't applicable if the person isn't actually genuine and you gotta be able to tell but I think OP's gf is genuine so I think he'll be able to work it out.
SuicideWatch,fi6linh,t1_fi6kbvc,1582200080.0,"No one is obligated to do anything ever but when you feel a sense of duty to making sure that someone is ok, that is called love and care so though you don't really have to, you can't call someone your girlfriend or you spouse or your SO if you leave as soon as it gets slightly inconvenient. Professional help is good and useful but sometimes you just need someone close to you, figuratively and literally. She needs him and he's great for trying his best. Please OP please please don't leave her it really really hurts when you're on the receiving end please don't leave her."

Putting space between you and her is the worst thing you could do please do not do that no matter what you do she needs you even if she doesn't show it she needs your company and you give her a sense of security I'm saying this from experience and trust me if that sense of security disappears it will break break her, it broke me and trust me you do not want that for her. As for fixing her suicidal thoughts I'm not a therapist but I would feel like you need to make her feel loved. Im guessing you love her but just try and make that more obvious so that she can't ignore it hug her more hold her be close have close physical contact it  scientifically lowers stress and negative feelings. Whatever you do be there for her be the constant in her always be the one she can count on so that she knows that she is wanted and needed and someone cares about her I empathise with her cause my SO shut me out after I confided my suicidal thoughts to her and she wasn't able to handle it and it completely destroyed me so I really don't want it to happens to anyone else man that's all I have to say please if you read this promise me you won't leave her"

Um, I meant more of a purposeful situation I guess, where your loved one accompanies you while you set up your death, and he/she knows what you are going to do, and may or not be ok with it, and I was wondering if that would work, if someone being there in your final moments not to try and revive you at all costs, but to try and relieve the pain as long as possible.

It doesn't feel good to have an only friend cause if they cut their ties with you you are well and truly alone. Some people will tell you to ditch them but I'm telling you from personal experience that staying away from your only friend is the most painful thing you could do to yourself.
