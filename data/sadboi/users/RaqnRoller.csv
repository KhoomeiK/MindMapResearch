As for what you decided to reply to one of my comments I made on a post in a totally different subreddit like 120 days ago: I don’t think everyone is stupid but me, but I’m definitely starting to think you have issues."

Also you’re insanely good at not understanding words. I never said everyone was stupid but me, lol, I wouldn’t put that in quotations :*"
trees,foq1z1z,t1_foq0lps,1587980047.0,"I’m not quite sure who has to wind their neck in here. I never said you were, dude, but that’s what my original comment was replying to. Context, it’s super important. 

This guy totally has every right to be anxious, share that anxiety and not be called a 12 year old. How is that coddling? Just because you’re anxious about smoking doesn’t mean you’re 12, it means you probably live where it’s not legal? Pointing that out has nothing to do with coddling anyone.

You coming in a pointing out that not everyone is going to make a citizen arrest or care about it has nothing to do with me pointing out to someone that it’s not legal everywhere with the point that you shouldn’t call someone 12 for getting anxiety. Absolutely nothing that you are saying makes any sense in the context of the original comment and why I replied.

Yeah, most people aren’t going to call the cops or make a citizen arrest, but should you call people 12 for being anxious about it possibly happening? No. Because it could be illegal where they are. That was the entire point of my comment. 

:)"
trees,foq0hvb,t1_fopzid4,1587978516.0,"Yes, but do you also realize that some people have anxiety and/or get paranoid and calling them 12 for being anxious/paranoid about it doesn’t make any sense?"

Generally has to do with: I don’t feel like their personality will work with mine in a relationship, I don’t see myself with them, we have a lot of differences, they aren’t good at communication, etc... 

And from a woman: ignore the dudes telling you to buff up and hit the gym or treat women with no respect. They’re idiots lol

AskReddit,fcazobt,t3_cxkklf,1577579786.0,"Because exercise is ew and food is yum. 

Seriously though, cardio is the best thing for losing weight but if I’m ashamed of my body it makes me too anxious to go running/biking outside or go to a gym.

But if I’d like to blame it on something other than me: anxiety and high stress, parents for feeding me fast food and high calorie meals all the time and now I can’t get the damn weight off (can only eat what you’ve got right?) and the fact that bad foods are generally cheap and filling and I’m broke as a joke"
AmItheAsshole,fcayifn,t3_efar69,1577579135.0,"Most of the people commenting here are so stupid. No, you’re not the asshole. 

You told him you didn’t want to talk about it and set a boundary and he continued to blatantly disrespect it. So what, you had a breakdown IN FRONT of him and didn’t tell him whats wrong? Does he not have the capacity to be nice and empathetic even if he doesn’t know what’s wrong? You communicated as well as you needed to. Although throwing in a “I don’t want to talk right now, it’s not you though” would probably be a benefit. It’s also extra respectable of you to want to wait to have a serious talk for when your kids are out of the room/asleep, and major asshole points to him for basically trying to light a gas fire in front of them. I also can’t believe he told you that you ruined Christmas like WTF

As for the reason you’re upset, which you didn’t ask about but people surely are commenting on, it’s totally understandable. I’m an emotional person and if that happened to me I’d be bawling my eyes out."

dating_advice,fbtauir,t3_ebr1b0,1577073085.0,"If you’re just SOOO ugly, do you really have the place to call someone “normal”? 

Stop with the whole “I’m ugly” incel pity party. Better yourself not just by working out and blah blah but by trying to fix your shitty personality and outlook. Find a hobby that isn’t constantly rating people on reddit and saying “normie”. Stop being so focused on leagues and appearances, you sound like a 14 year old boy who’s balls haven’t dropped yet. Just.. just stop with the incel shit. It’s immature and then incels wonder why no one wants them.

Fat girls know all too well what it’s like to be purely judged and rejected based off appearance. They swipe on people they think are interesting, not just appealing."
