I reported my third rape. It’s been hell and I’m scared shitless. I want it to stop. I want it to be over, and I’m so scared. But realistically, he deserves everything he is getting. I wish I reported the other two. I still can but it would be hard to prove except statutory rape for one of them who needed the charges because he has a daughter now and abandoned her. It’s all messy but pressing these charges could save others in my case. And in your case they could too."

StopSelfHarm,fnuvjjx,t3_g3vxug,1587272225.0,"Ask her for help with things to help you cope. It will give her a sense of control. “Hey mom, I need to make a coping toolbox, can you help me with getting somethings for it?” And build a list of items for her to help you get. So like maybe puzzles for distraction, ice packs for the TIPP skill (it’s a DBT skill), some type of fidget toys, sudoku books, a journal and pens. Parents not understanding is normal, they won’t get it unless they have been there. I can explain it again and again in different ways to my dad and he still doesn’t understand it. It’s been 11 years. Instead give her things that can help her understand that it’s lack of coping and you need to be able to cope. Also try to figure out why you do it and make a point of saying it and how these things can connect to coping better. I figured out this works with my dad. He is a problem solver so it’s harder on him than my mom."

therapy,fngep6u,t3_g1ewx3,1586929940.0,It is unprofessional to talk about serious traumas over a screen. Online or telehealth is for more mild things and there needs to be more than just a call.

Which is something good therapists see through. But what I mean by observation is that they are going to see how you tell your stories about what has happened to you. Eventually they will peace enough things together, ask you the right questions, and figure out what’s going on and what is causing it to make a diagnosis and then treat you for it. 

And honestly, I get what you mean but now that I have the diagnosis I feel more invalidated by it."
rapecounseling,fnbsjzr,t3_g0lvm4,1586821474.0,It’s been killing me.

Especially since some of us got isolated from our friends and family this exact time last year by our abuser. Because that’s my problem. I’m isolated from my freedom again reliving everything he did to me last year during this exact time. This time is HELL for people with trauma and mental illness.
BPD,fmt509d,t3_fx9jc0,1586366961.0,A diagnosis is only a guide to proper treatment. So while bringing it up to your therapist might help you with getting different treatment options it also might lead them away from what they were actively working on with you. I would still tell her your concern but just know that a diagnosis is only a means for how to best treat it. Also there’s no test for BPD. They will have to determine if you have it or not just by observation.
therapy,fmt3cp2,t3_fx5u3l,1586366208.0,Child therapists allow children to play with toys during their sessions and will quickly find out when a child has been sexually abused because these children at very young ages have been exposed to it and will act it out with their toys repeating it. (You said you didn’t have trauma so I assume that comment was safe to say. Let me know if it wasn’t.) So with that considered I’m 100% positive your therapist has talked about sex with other people around your age and this wouldn’t be new or shocking. If you want to talk about it maybe say something like “can I talk about sex right now?” And just hit the ground running. Most likely your therapist will allow you to talk freely since it’s your time and they are getting information from you to help you.

therapy,fmqzea9,t3_fwsmks,1586310380.0,"Therapy is a lot of work. I’d discuss how you feel about it to your therapist. Ask them “why do you only ask me this” and see what they say. Maybe they feel like whenever they try to lead you into a topic you back away from it. Also get a journal. Journal about what you talked about during therapy, journal about things in between therapy, and even bring your journal with you and talk to them about what you wrote. Read them some stuff. It helps them get an idea of what is going on."

Im currently dating the first person since my last rape and he literally went to his first shirt for me, he helps me so whatever my therapist tells us to do, and would never tell me to give him my passwords. To imagine him saying that me keeping details away from him was a reason to force me into a threesome and crossing my boundaries (this is going to be rape if he follows through but it’s still abuse to say this) is absolutely insane. Somebody keeping secrets about a traumatizing assault does not mean you can abuse them farther when finding out. I’ve had guys in between me and him do this in smaller ways (obviously wasn’t close to them) and those are the tell tell signs I shouldn’t be dating them."

My dad would catch me acting like her as a teenager and call me out on it using her name specifically. She molded me into a monster just like her.

rapecounseling,flfhb9o,t3_foeecn,1585106571.0,"This is a hard topic because a lot of people here have been with repeat offenders (I have as well) but here’s the thing, not all traumas are experienced at the same levels. A stealth to person A of similar situation can feel like a complete and total betrayal and be extremely traumatizing and a stealth to person b can be just hurtful and something they can work through with the person. You can talk it out and explain to him how it hurt you and can work on it with him as well as setting boundaries and conditions around sex and condoms and such. I don’t know him so I don’t know if he will do it again, but if you really miss him and there’s steps he is taking to self improve then you can make the choice if you want to try again. But I will say IF you try again you MUST talk to him about your boundaries. Write them down for when you talk to him. Even if you write him a letter and read it to him. I want you to be safe and the choice is up to you but make sure he knows you are serious about it hurting you and what he can do now and going on in the future how he can gain your trust back."

These kids are very much taken care of and normally have full stimulation from day cares, school, and more. This advice is for parents who need to let their children learn to be bored and learn to play with their own toys and imagination alone or with their siblings. No healthy person would EVER say this to a known emotionally neglectful parent. It’s basically “hey you’d kids are fed, bathed, and warm. Let them go learn to play on their own!

When I was 15 my therapist told me about this woman who was in her 30’s and cuts over 30 times a day. It gave me motivation to stop eventually because it scared me that I’ll never stop and end up like her but it’s very validating as you get older to stop the guilt cycle over 3 cuts every few weeks vs 30 every day. I’m not too old to be hurting, that one lady is much older (probs in her 40’s now) and still doing it. Or maybe she finally recovered. Who knows! But still never to old."

therapy,fl2p4vp,t3_fm1d5r,1584756388.0,"I did over 8 months of DBT therapy weekly. The whole thing is basically worksheets. I have a binder full of them. Reason why I think worksheets are helpful? You have them explaining stuff, then you have it there in your hand for access later. There’s little tests and scales like the Burns checklist to see where depression levels are at for tracking. 

Now imagine this: it’s half way in between your next appointment, you are in crisis, it’s 3AM and all of your friends are asleep, you grab your therapy binder, find the worksheet that will walk you through the crisis, you follow the steps, you calm down enough to journal about it, and go to sleep. You wake up, clean yourself up, write about your night again in your journal now that you are much more calm, you function the rest of the week. You go to your appointment, you tell them about your victory, read them the journal entry and then your therapist gives you praise and can figure out what they can do for you next. 

Worksheets are such an amazing tool. They provide visuals for you later. I do recommend a therapy binder. Collecting your worksheets into an arsenal for you to use is a great way to take advantage of them. I wish I did it sooner. I also wish I took notes more in therapy and in groups."

I keep a journal but the validation is what I’m needing. With close friends I can’t talk to them about it for validation because they just don’t get it and it’s a fight with who makes it more about themselves.

SuicideWatch,fi3u7xk,t3_f65mrc,1582127751.0,"It gets better once you put in the work to make it better. In high school it never got better because even with a year of therapy there was no work to make it better. It’s only gotten worse for me because I didn’t work hard to make it better before. If I was truly getting better before then I wouldn’t have met the person who caused me to get worse because I would have never crossed paths with him. There would have never been a dark spot to take advantage of. Right now I’m dealing with the PTSD of it but I’m in weekly therapy and trying to get better and attempting to put in the work. Giving up and not working for the better is how you let the depression, anxiety, and mental illness win. That’s how the suicide and self harm win. That’s how everything wins and you don’t get better. There’s tons of methods to try to get better and some work for some and others work for some and sometimes you need one method to make another work. Try it all with full intention.

Teach people this behavior is unacceptable even if atheist or whatever other religion here.

rapecounseling,fhqykeu,t1_fhqy4dt,1581813592.0,I feel a lot more comfortable with them together instead of apart. I feel so much more comfortable with Rita.
ptsd,fho0u3i,t1_fhn7xuu,1581737888.0,Yeah talk about it after! At least wait until you get through the distress tolerance section. If the mindfulness exercises are too much with the body sensation ones then suggest to the group leaders to do the leaves on a stream one. It’s really good and honestly the easiest one to master. But at least distress tolerance. That’s going to prevent the next suicide attempt. Make sure you get a binder too! Practice them! Well worth it. I did DBT for almost a year and I think it works. I have the PDF for it if you need it.
ptsd,fho0iga,t1_fhnblte,1581737603.0,I just bought one that helps with the physical symptoms of trauma. I think they will be helpful.
ptsd,fhn4ep4,t3_f3za3r,1581721869.0,"Have you talked about how to treat the crisis before starting the therapy? Maybe giving you the skills, crisis plans, and practicing them and even role playing drills with people who are a part of the crisis plans? So something like DBT for the skills (I have the PDF’s if you want it), a typed up document with a full plan for when you’re in crisis and what you want with you if you end up hospitalized from the plan going “sideways” even though you alive is the point of the plan. Coping ahead is a DBT skill but if you set everything up before so you can start unboxing it then maybe you’ll be more comfortable. Bring a blanket to the session that you’ll start all of it so you can stay in it and create signals or a code for when it’s too much to keep talking about. A code might be easy with friends/family who are part of the crisis plan. An emoji text to them with a weird emoji you never use can be a code for it and picking up an object off a surface in your therapists office can be a signal to stop. So you don’t even have to be vocal. Hold an object and drop it if it’s too much."
selfharm,fhn2bb1,t3_f3mcp3,1581721156.0,I’m so glad this is her reaction. My parents didn’t get me therapy in time. Good luck!!!
ptsd,fhn25e6,t1_fhn1ym1,1581721073.0,It sounds like you have some symptoms but that’s just my experience. Until therapy starts please get a workbook. I have them and they help. Also trauma books like waking the tiger are good. I haven’t finished it but so far I like it.
ptsd,fhmz1v7,t3_f3yuks,1581719849.0,Right now go start workbooks for ptsd and trauma. Get those skills and therapy now before your body gets a chance to suffer more. It will help getting help early.
rapecounseling,fhmyssq,t1_fhmygew,1581719726.0,I mean I donated to a zoo for it rather than using that $5 on unhealthy coping.

selfharm,fhmxv0i,t3_f3utth,1581719428.0,I’m 23 and if I didn’t have tumblr in middle school and high school I would have stopped sooner. It was a big enabler. I think her reasoning is wrong but it’s true. I started cutting without tumblr but eventually found it and kept indulging myself in it. People justified it for me on the internet. Told me it was okay. Tried saying harm reduction is better all while I’m still seeing deeper cuts on my feed. I didn’t know it until recently (1 year 3 months self harm free) how much the internet triggered me until I was using another internet space with sh memes and I felt enabled and wanted to do it more than if I wasn’t seeing the stuff. Some days I don’t even have the thought until I see this sub and it makes me think of it. I’d rather be alone instead of enabled.
rapecounseling,fhmvfrb,t3_f3j5tz,1581718526.0,Ask her to have her therapist give her advice for what you can do. Tell her to either a) write a letter to you b) bring you in for 5 minutes at the end or beginning to talk about it. Take interest in what she tells you from therapy. Ask her what she wants from you and if she can tell you when she feels triggered so you can help her avoid those triggers. My fwb squeezed my hand one time and it turned into a full flash back and he didn’t even know. I am supposed to tell him my triggers.
TalkTherapy,fhmtyge,t3_f3t29s,1581717969.0,My mental health records barely have notes. Their notes are pretty short. Honestly? Not worth it. There’s nothing in there that’s worth anything unless you are struggling to realize something on your own. But that’s really it.
rapecounseling,fhjw012,t3_f3m8pg,1581657308.0,Sometimes it takes a long time to say rape. But just remember. Try to avoid saying “I was raped” always say “he raped me” because you’re putting the blame on him and not focusing hard on your part in it other than the victim. It took me a year or so to say this about an ex. Took me two weeks about the last guy. You’ll find the strength. Write it down in a journal “name of guy raped me” over and over and over again. One day you can speak it.
rapecounseling,fhi8hbc,t1_fhhzgom,1581619751.0,Yup! Message me if you want also. I’m a mod on a discord server about journaling (probably a lot less stressful than a place like here)
rapecounseling,fhhyo7p,t1_fhhykgf,1581614357.0,[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Journaling/comments/f1s95r/trying_to_parse_out_my_feelings_about_a/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) you go!
rapecounseling,fhhy25f,t3_f35wtd,1581614010.0,"I don’t have much advice but I can tell you that my male gyno happened to be perfect for me. I was raped by an airforce guy and my male gyno is a retired airforce officer/doctor. When I told him about the rape and how I’m reporting it after meeting him he has been nothing but supportive and kind. Older guy who was there when the airforce wasn’t cracking down on sexual assault yet. He asked questions like “they are treating you well right?!” When talking about investigators and such. I would rather have him then a chick who might disregard something because she too has a vagina. I hope you’re able to go and get checked out. Also if you’re in a health care system like I am, telling them alone what happened might give you access to therapy. My gyno and therapists are on the same campus. Referrals can happen quick."
rapecounseling,fhhkt58,t1_fhgytmq,1581606428.0,Have you tried journaling? If you scroll on the r/journaling sub there’s a person who made a chart to see if they have feelings for somebody. You could list out words and definitions and try to do the same. If you’re interested and can’t find the link I’ll send it to you.
rapecounseling,fhgj3r7,t3_f30qfu,1581568524.0,"> I hate how I can’t remember how it was started.

That’s what they do. They catch you off guard. I don’t remember how it happened either. Everything was so confusing. I hope you know this isn’t your fault. No matter how confusing and how unable you are to label it. It’s not your fault."
SuicideWatch,fhf2g9e,t1_fhf25zs,1581534845.0,Considering my parents work for the company and I can go to therapy during the week no questions asked. No. I’m getting paid too good for what I’m doing and know and I can make it to appointments freely.
SuicideWatch,fheo90l,t1_fhenggc,1581526515.0,Most of these people are random guys I work with.
ptsd,fhdel2s,t3_f2jr9l,1581484013.0,Not Mormon but newly Christian. Don’t ever feel the need to repent for your assault. Ask God for strength now. Ask him for healing. Ask him for the hurt to stop. He knows you didn’t have to repent. He knows the cruel ways of the people who made you repent and the attacker themselves. You are a survivor.
rapecounseling,fhde3my,t1_fhddu9p,1581483638.0,Thanks! I’m glad I can be useful. I’ve been thinking a lot about it since then. Like another thing I need to start saying is “he/they raped me” not “I was raped” you know what I mean? More blame on the guys who hurt me.
SuicideWatch,fhbgdjb,t3_f1zvun,1581441747.0,"Psych ward checklist: blanket, socks, (if you’re a girl bring a bra with no underwire) hoodie with no strings, pj pants with no strings, normal jeans that fit without a belt and shirts, underwear, composition book or book bound journal, toiletries (they will keep them locked up so you can’t drink them. Ask for them when you need them for showering!) biggest tip: wear normal clothes. Don’t wear PJ’s all day and night. It will make you feel more depressed. I feel better when I dress normal vs how everyone else is in PJ’s or scrubs. It makes me feel more secure and normal. Slides or crocs to walk around in because you can’t have shoelaces. Slip on vans are perfect for psych wards if they allow shoes. You are allowed to wash your clothes normally, you are allowed to bring playing cards for solitaire and crayons. Don’t wear any military or government sweatshirts (I wore my ex’s from BMT and the two dudes with schizophrenia saw it and the conversation ended in them paranoid and scared of me and aliens. It’s kinda funny now but I would never wear it again there.) and bring an appropriate book. Some hospitals lack groups, others don’t. I would 100% recommend going to as many groups as possible. And when the social worker asks what you are going to do when you get out of the hospital, you tell them you’re getting some tacos because “uh idk probably sleep? I don’t know” makes them worried. Be honest with them. Be strict with your boundaries and say “I don’t feel comfortable with this medication you’re suggesting” if you don’t want to try it. If they won’t give you your birth control (again idk if you’re a girl or not) or other meds you’re supposed to be on be assertive and tell them. Take time to journal and express thoughts and concerns in the journal and give yourself a list of things you want to address with the doctors and staff. It’s a very emotional time for people and I whole heartily believe that coming prepared with your own stuff and getting help on your own terms will make the stay less traumatic. I know being thrown into a psych ward with no clothes, hospital blankets, and no toiletries makes me more anxious and less likely to get the help I need vs being prepared and ready to accept any help they try to give. You know what I mean? Pack yourself a bag, walk into the ER, tell them the truth, and everything will be much smoother. Sometimes they won’t even hospitalize you and you’ll get put in an outpatient program rather than hospitalization which might be more helpful unless you feel like a danger to yourself. Message me if you have anymore questions. Edit: I just reread your post and saw you’ve already been there. Going in and admitting yourself is better than being forced. Good luck. Still, message me if you need to."
ptsd,fhbeclb,t3_f1wwhv,1581440545.0,"Once the first few people do it to you during childhood, the rest come naturally. You’ve learned it’s normal and no boundaries are ever set. One of my biggest problems to this day."
rapecounseling,fh7zbi3,t1_fh7z6f3,1581348483.0,I’m glad you could understand it! I just worked a long shift with no sleep and I’m back at work again. I just want to let you know that even using words like “sexually abused” would work too. But you figure out how you need to define it so you can work through your trauma!
rapecounseling,fh7z0qn,t3_f1od6h,1581348283.0,"Defining things can be hard. Rape is a quick 4 letter word that nobody wants to question or ask for details. Sexual assault people feel the need to demand explanations. Theres so many different types of this general type of abuse. You can’t always put into words how scared they make you feel at the time or why you listened to them even if you don’t want to do it. So taking away somebodies chance to question you by saying rape is understandable. But I also understand where you’re coming from about the other end of it where you feel like you’re invalidating others by saying it since it technically isn’t the correct word for what you described. I think learning to define what happened correctly and becoming firm in your story is key to being able to feel comfortable about speaking about it. Don’t let anyone ask questions or question the situation when talking about it unless it’s a therapist. Humans have to label things. That’s how we define the world around us. Hot is hot, cold is cold. But things like this confuse us. Our own trauma and others trauma tries to invalidate each other and ourselves because it doesn’t make sense. The trauma doesn’t know what to label things. It’s weird. I hope what I’m saying makes sense and I’m understanding what you’re saying. If not just let me know!"
