It was hard at first, but because it’s been a good few years, I’ve learnt how to ease an ‘episode’: 
1. Don’t force yourself to enjoy something you previously enjoyed - it will only make things worse.
2. Try to use this symptom as an opportunity to explore a new hobby. Although this is hit or miss, I’ve found a few things mildly interesting to do and helped me pass the time. 
3. This sounds super stupid, but try not to be retrospective. Thinking back to the golden days where you used to enjoy x or y will again just make you feel worse. 

Overall, I just try to get on with life and try to laugh at my thoughts more. Also I try to make the most of the good day’s, create positive memories to look back on when I’m feeling down. :)"
