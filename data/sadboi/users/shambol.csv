The main job of a parent is socialise their child into the culture/society that they will eventually grow up and live in Much of a societies' culture is wrapped up in the societies religion.

>We  know boarders are not as well off as their skier counterparts so they  probably donâ€™t spend as much time on the mountain and when they do they  donâ€™t get lessons as often.

that is a over generalisation  the problem with snowboarding is it is quiet unpleasant in icey conditions, you slip and fall a lot more so most people will just go skiing if they are going to be out on well tracked piste 

>The  sport is young so they didnâ€™t grow up learning from a young age (taught  from their parents) as a lot of those expert skiers did.

Its not that young there are plenty of people with kids that snow boarded from their youth. unfortunately they do not recommend that younger children snowboard (I think they say 5 years old) whereas they let children ski as soon as they can walk i imagine that is why there are more skiiers. in austria the local ski club is socially very important so there is a huge amount of resources  put into this.  Snow boarding is something that the individual decides to take up later and they cannot do it all the time in lower resorts."
