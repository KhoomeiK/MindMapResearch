It's mostly plant-based (Half of plate is veggies, one fourth is carbs, one fourth is protein) Foods high in sodium and carbs make you bloated. You don't really hear that about carbs but I've noticed that when I eat mostly carbs like when I'm craving, my whole body is bloated the next day. I've cut off processed foods and fast foods, but I still eat lots of fruits everyday and ice cream a few times a week so I don't know about the effects of sugar on bloating? Anyway, your water intake is super important. Make sure you drink lots of water everyday. This whole thing also helped me with my acne and made my skin a bit brighter. I know it might sound overwhelming but you don't need the fancy ingredients. I've kept it so simple. There are so many people on instagram and youtube that are just so lovely and creative with healthy dishes and snacks, so yeah, good luck!"

People even tell me not to dye my very dark brown hair, because ""it's like a contrast with my skin."" There are so many beautiful girls with medium or medium dark skin here, especially in the south of Iran, they have gorgeous eyes and eyebrows, gorgeous features, yet colourism won't let them to present themselves as they are. There is STILL a very good market for skin whitening products here. I'm not even that much of a looker, but ever since I was a kid people complimented my skin. I don't understand it.

When you look at the numbers presented by a news source that has no ties to the Iranian government whatsoever, it's a different story. Iran Intl. a London based new source reports of 1300 deaths. NOT about 400. They're constantly playing voicemails of people that are calling and saying that the situation is terrible. Rasht's governor just said that had the real numbers been revealed, people would've started to self-quarantine way earlier.
