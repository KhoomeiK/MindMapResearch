relationships,fgzl9l5,t3_f0w93c,1581195183.0,"I think you should stick to your gut. You know where you want to be, and you‚Äôve already moved away from there once and you said you aren‚Äôt crazy about where you are now. If you know that there aren‚Äôt many opportunities in your field in the country he‚Äôs moving to, and if you think that you‚Äôll end up financially dependent on him (even if he‚Äôs offering that to you) I personally don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a great idea. Not because he won‚Äôt support you - I totally think he would if you went with him - but because of your own sense of agency, which you‚Äôd already be compromising by moving. Moving out of the country could be a huge adventure, but moving without a specific personal intention would fee like throwing part of myself away. Don‚Äôt get me wrong - there are people who travel the world at their leisure on a whim but they (to generalize!) don‚Äôt usually have many financial responsibilities, live off of inherited wealth, etc. 

If I were making a post like this on reddit, I‚Äôd be looking for validation of the opinion that I already hold, to either strengthen or weaken my resolve. You probably already know, somewhere, what you want to do and what would make you happy, and which compromises you‚Äôd be willing to make and which you wouldn‚Äôt."
