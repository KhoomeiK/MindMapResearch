PCOS,f036h1v,t3_d37p0g,1568346111.0,"I was in the same situation as you. I am 22 years old and from a Muslim country. I was born and raised in America but my ethnicity is from a Muslim country so whatever that's what I meant to say.

I am also not a virgin. I didn't love my mom inside the room but that is because I wanted to be 100% honest with my doctor. I think you can bring your mom inside and say that you are indeed a virgin and then they will just do the ultrasound from over your stomach. Since you were worried about PCOS and not if you are pregnant, have an STD, or ect. I think that it won't matter. One small lie for the sake of your health. You can also tell your doctor in private that you don't want your mother to know and they will respect that. 

anyone who disagrees with this, I understand but you also need to understand that coming from a conservative culture, even if your parents as you you are not having sex... Birth control sounds like something a person who sleeps around uses or whatever. A lot of us Muslims have parents that come from countries where sex is very taboo and birth control pills and other forms of contraception are considered really slutty to use. 

we know that that is not the case but sometimes you need to just play along and not fight for the sake of your own health"

While studying abroad in Japan, a Japanese student ran to their room and brought natto because he overheard our table of 6 talking about it. He was super excited and showed it to us. It looked like sticky, slimy, shitty, beans. I am not much of a picky eater so I was willing to try it but others were pretty rude about how gross it looked. I didn't want to hurt the dudes feelings because he was so cool for bringing it over so I tried it and you know what? It wasn't half bad. I wouldn't buy it myself but I am glad I tried it. 4 of us tried it out of politeness and I told the Japanese student it was very good and thanked him. 

Later when he left one of the girls who was especially rude was talking shit and I wanted to punch her in the face.

That doesn't mean some people as a whole are more beautiful than others. Absolutely not. Everything is case by case. An Asian dude who is 6' is attractive when you wouldn't really take note of that as much if it was a Dutch guy for example because being Asian, the average height is less. 

Don't be offended because he said Asian. Also don't mix up his words with how you feel. He did not say you are pretty for an Asian girl. That has a completely different meaning."

I come from a Pakistani background and I got an average of 5ish. (I posted as a motivation after stopping my depression pills and wanting to make good changes in my life). You can't make a big claim like that by finding some very specific comments and showing two guys as an example. You are picking and choosing because I too posted in this subreddit.

On average Indians and pakistanis look very different. For example, look at northern pakistanis who have more Anglo facial features, light eyes, ECT. There was some of those people that look good and others look bad. Then you can look at the bulk of the Indian subcontinent with people if chai colored skin. Subconsciously, language and clothing could play a part. That's like saying why are Germans ranked lower than Russians on this subreddit or something of that sort. It is honestly case-by-case and there are good and bad qualities in all people that we internationally find sexier.
