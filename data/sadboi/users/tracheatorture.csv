depression,exd881c,t3_cs2ogj,1566169756.0,omg love i feel you so much. i truly feel like dying would made me the most serene ever but seeing my mom cry over me (which i’ve never witness before) explained how she wouldn’t know what to do with herself if something happened to me made me decide to stay for her.
selfharm,exctmnc,t1_excswdw,1566159298.0,"i just took a shower, and yes you are correct. ouch."
selfharm,esdbdas,t3_c73xng,1561852447.0,my mom is a psychologist.. i feel you. i’ve struggles with disordered eating a little(nothing super extreme) and restricting and she’s always on my ass. i’m also on new meds that give me zero appetite. she forces me to eat and is always suspicious when i don’t.
selfharm,ertn8l7,t3_c3w4gc,1561247344.0,anything you do to yourself that harms you is self harm
selfharm,erddxat,t1_er7afun,1560738867.0,"thank you love, i appreciate that"
selfharm,erddwit,t1_er7bm49,1560738846.0,"it means a lot, thank you"
selfharm,erddvyu,t1_er7lgdq,1560738833.0,exactly. i just want to stop existing.
selfharm,erddv3j,t1_er75c2i,1560738810.0,i have a therapist and i haven’t been hospitalized yet. there’s a huge chance i might tomorrow though because i have an appointment with her and i hate lying to her. i genuinely almost did try to do it yesterday night. so we’ll see what happens :/. i honesty would rather anything else in the world than being hospitalized but i guess it’s not my choice.
selfharm,epktk6b,t1_epksqe5,1559280808.0,yeah but i’m at my dad’s house and i don’t have any long sleeve shirts at the moment :/
selfharm,ep2834g,t3_btifhb,1559003805.0,yep. every fucking day of my life.
selfharm,ep281om,t3_btr8fh,1559003782.0,"to be honest this scared me at first but i’m happy for you, stay safe :)"
selfharm,ep27yc1,t3_btpdsw,1559003726.0,that’s great <3
selfharm,eoxl5gw,t3_btdcpa,1558925486.0,i basically have a care free attitude about the whole thing. i just genuinely don’t care what anyone says. i’ve had people stare a little due to the shock value of everything but i’ve nevwr had someone actually come up to me and ask about it. sure i get nervous now and again but i think you should feel comfortable in whatever you wear no matter what is on your skin.
selfharm,eoxksco,t3_btdneg,1558925341.0,fast so i don’t flinch
selfharm,eoxk6nr,t3_btfrcu,1558925109.0,"you did better than you think. you lasted two whole weeks ! plus a little setback doesn’t make your worthless. it happens to all of us. plus the fact you feel sick afterwards is definitely improvement. i hope you stay safe, and just know i love you and and hope for the best for you. <3"
selfharm,eoxjj5t,t3_btgab3,1558924853.0,"believe me, in a couple of years you won’t want to be controlled by a razor blade. something i tend to do to resist the urge is draw on my skin with red marker to create the illusion of blood or scars even though i didn’t actually hurt myself. or just draw flowers if you want something more positive."
selfharm,eoxj2nx,t3_btgfb5,1558924676.0,"been there. honestly try to distract yourself with anything. i tend to call my friends and talk to them about random things or draw on my leg. my advice is to throw away any blades you have and walk away from the location that you’re more likely to sh at.

also is your user a spin off on lexapro ? haha cause if so that’s genius."
selfharm,eoxijqg,t3_btghyr,1558924458.0,"i love you so much. i wish i could hug you right now (or just support you without physical touch if that makes you uncomfortable). i’m in the exact same place in my life where i don’t want to be clean but at the same time trying my best to stay that way. whatever you chose to do, you still deserve only love and support, but i know that in the future you won’t want a blade to control your life. please stay safe no matter what you do <3"
selfharm,eosjvqs,t1_eormgqt,1558824344.0,i don’t think she means it like that. she just knows i’m suicidal and doesn’t want me to do anything stupid when i’m not under her supervision. although we argue i know she’s means well.
selfharm,eor2sky,t3_bsva8g,1558800261.0,please get help. you deserve so much happiness and my heart hurts for you. therapy has impacted my life so much and i think you would really benefit for it. just know i love you and i’m here for you.
