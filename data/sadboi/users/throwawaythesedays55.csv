makeyourchoice,fq4uruy,t3_ggrm5j,1589084645.0,"Location: European City, lots of places to visit while still retaining it historical charms (8)

Exterior: Gothic, fits with the location and is just gorgeous from an architectural stand point.(5)

Interior: Antique. Fits with the gothic look and my personal taste (3)

Add ons: Chef, Butler, pet, pool, art studio, garden, library(-4) A personal chef and butler to attend to me in a historic home. I'll enjoy reading and painting during days indoors. Explore the gardens and swim during sunny weather. My cat will accompany me and eat food prepared by the chef.

Bonus points: Mormons and resident evil (0) Maybe the Mormons are attracted to my home because of the evil presence and they wish to help me get rid of it. Butler will deal with the Mormons, not me. I may not believe in ghosts but if there are any, they're probably in my gothic house, sleeping on the antique furniture."

depression,fk8zksk,t3_fgnp3a,1583965838.0,I used to be super happy and bubbly at school then go home and cry. I how now morphed into making passive dark jokes about depression and suicide in a sarcastic/joking manner because its the only socially acceptable way to express my feelings.

SuicideWatch,f6r70xz,t1_f6r6exg,1573095332.0,Currently unemployed so I lay in bed a lot a watch anime and chuldhood movies. I said fuck college and fuck work. Although I am trying to find a job just being like that feels so nice. Sometimes I secretly hope I'll never find a job and stay cuddled up in bed forever. It's just a dream though because surely I'll get kicked out eventually.

depression,eucc8nm,t1_eucbsmm,1563671007.0,I didn't ask to be society's investment or to be born. I find life sucks so often that the few moments that it doesn't isn't worth it. I don't consider life not sucking exactly enjoying it either. Life is unfulfilling and meaningless to me. Rather just end it now

If you haven't taught the command quiet, don't yell""Quiet"" and expect the barking to stop. It just encourages it to keep going. It's a Chihuahua mix. I don't like chihuahuas in general because of the yapping,aggression, general spoiltness. This dog embodies all of that."
