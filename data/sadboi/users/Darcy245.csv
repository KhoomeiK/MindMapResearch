Anxiety,fpq4orv,t3_geiyn7,1588815107.0,"I relate to this.  I feel I avoid things especially if I am having an increase of anxiety/panic symptoms. I have a sensitive personality sometimes and fear disappointing people, so I figure why try? Approval addiction is such a big thing with anxiety sufferers. I try to shift my focus from disappointment to wondering ""what is the worst that can happen if someone doesn't like your food?"" For me it helps to think like that because the worst imagined never happens for the most part."
