I feel that (have for a long time) that im only depressed cuase its trendy and romanticised. I think that romanticizing mental ilness isnt exposing people to it, its scaring those who are suffering away. Since if its normalised why should i seek out help when everyone else isnt and from theyre instagram they have #anxiety and #depression. These people make me sick. Fun fact thats why i also hate myself!"

For example this is what i do in ~2 hours/day: 1 etude, 1-2 smaller pieces (up to 5 pages each), scales/arpeggios/broken chord runs"
lingling40hrs,f35y45i,t1_f35xof9,1570697206.0,"You portion the piece into MANAGEABLE sections, either by technique/phrasing/hand postion/etc. .

Then work on a section very SLOWLY, its important to do it slowly, so you can do it with the right technique/expression/etc. (This doesnt apply to really slow pieces)

Analyze the music to find patterns, per example in bach its helpful to find the subject, counter-subject, etc. 

If youre at a technically difficult section, or practicing etudes. Use accents, rhythms.

And most importantly REPETITION.
(As a rule of thumb, you've learnt a section if you can play it at ~50-70% tempo, as perfectly as possible, 3 times in a row.)

The point I'm making is that if you sight read stuff that is technically difficult, you have to divide your attention between the technical difficulfties and sight reading correctly (i.e. not looking at your hands, reading ahead, and playing at a consistent tempo."

Lingodeer is basically a grammar course, with practical use of grammar, but it doesnt teach too many words (probably less than a 800). Lingodeer plus is the companion app, but you have to pay for it seperately. It teaches 3000+ words, lets you practice articles, conjugation, grammar in general, has phrase games, and reading/listening exercises which are great for seeing how far youve come. If you dont want to use lingodeer, but use something else as a main course, i would still recommend lingodeer plus. If you do choose to use lingodeer id recommend somekind of listening/speaking practice (i torrented pimsleur) . coffee break french is a great free option. After finishing lingodeer, im gonna use lingq, which has a great library of books, audiobooks, podcasts in french and you can even upload your own books, podcasts, audiobooks."
