What ""they"" want me to do is start an argument with you about Russiagate right now, rather than focus on the things we agree with.  They want you to be so disgusted with Trump, that an equally disgusting Biden seems like a better option.

In behaviorism, we call this a ""forced choice option"", and I use it a lot with behaviorally challenged kids as a way to let them feel like they have some control when I'm really the one framing their choices for them.

Biden and Obama laid the groundwork for a Trump presidency.  And the media has created a culture where if you are critical of anybody, you must be crazy and hate them.

This is all by design.  I will not reward it by voting for a Joe Biden.

At this point, if you vote, you're complicit in the evils that government, with the approval of both parties, perpetrates on us."

PublicFreakout,fqz6k1g,t1_fqz6263,1589760928.0,"People are understandably very angry right now, and it's by design that we turn on each other, rather than putting that anger where it belongs.

My personal mission is to intervene where I see people misplacing genuine and warranted anger.  It's not poor people collecting unemployment that are the issue.  It's the consolidation of the economy, and largest transfer of wealth in the history of mankind that passed the House with not even a voice vote.
 
It's so fucked up.  But everybody I know is pissed they can't play golf or get a haircut...because we've all got our priorities straight.

newhampshire,fqx5l4i,t1_fqx4pz7,1589726312.0,"Yah, I don't completely disagree.  I see this through the scope of societal decay.  Rotten, systemic corruption of our public institutions that started decades ago. 

I honestly have to stop myself from caring anymore, because the majority of actors living around you are living in a digital illusion, created to harness and motivate materialist economies and are so worried about their own livelihood, that they are blind to the bigger picture.  

The bail outs of corporations and banks, at the drop of a hat during a forced shut-down, with little to no help to regular people should be evidence enough to who our government serves. 

But what do I see in my circles?  People angry at poor people, or angry they can't play golf or get their hair done.  Real anger, re-directed away from where it should be targeted.

Like sheep to the slaughter."

I mean, most intellectuals I know don't lead with insults.  Just so you know, it can be off-putting to the person you're trying to convince with whatever argument you're making, ultimately leading them to make a value judgment about you as a person, completely ignoring the point you're making *because of* the very low level of respect you're showing that person from the get-go.

I think you're missing the part where the underpinnings of modern right libertarianism was part in parcel of the Reagan revolution which was a formative time for many current Republican politicians.  Not even just republicans, the idea of ""free markets"" (read corporate neo-fascism) is at this point the policy of both parties, which is why I don't think electoral politics is a reasonable path forward.

But the answer isn't to destroy government altogether.  And yes, Libertarians are in favor of ""private police"", and privatizing schools.  Look up the ""school sucks"" protests that used to happen in Keene all the time.

We probably see eye to eye on more than you think."
