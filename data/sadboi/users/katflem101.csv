The fear of having one at work is what stresses me out. My boss knows my diagnosis and supports me. She is curious about it and will ask me questions.

I can go from loving life and everyone in it to wanting to off myself and feeling hopeless, in the same day. I use to be very short tempered and irritable, before medicine."

schizoaffective,ffhuo68,t1_ffh8tp8,1579954739.0,I was on vraylar with Aristata and I’m thinking it may have given me mania so we stopped them and started lithium and latuda. I’m on gabapentin for anxiety and I take it the same time I take the latuda so I’m lucky where I don’t feel anxiety. The Aristata worked for the first two months then after that it started wearing off a week early then two weeks early. I heard voices for the first time (outside my head) last night and I don’t know if it’s because of my new medication or that the Aristata is still wearing itself off. (It’s a monthly injection and I had it three weeks ago) I don’t have insurance but my clinic has patient assistance where I can send my paystubs in and get latuda for free.

Why are you so angry? Just because you hate the world doesn’t mean everyone else does. Therapy could help you out buddy.
schizophrenia,f8bfzhs,t1_f8be08m,1574435974.0,"So I thought there was a 10% chance of actually passing it down, If it’s only one parent that has it. That means all her kids could live a “normal” life. Now for the 10%, in my experience, I’ve had it since I was a kid and I’d never change my childhood. Yeah things got scary when I became 21, but I knew what was happening because my family had it. I caught the bad before it got horrible and now I’m living relatively normal as long as I’m on medication my whole life. She’s aware of her condition and if her kids happen to have it, they’re not blindsided and can get them medicated. I think it’s selfish of you to say we can’t procreate. I’ve been struggling with this very subject for years now and I think your post is disgusting. She’s come on here to share a very happy part of her life and you’re tearing her down.

I know it’s exhausting for my fiancé to constantly remind me over and over that he loves me and no matter what he’ll always be there for me. It’s not for attention, it’s a genuine emotion that I feel worthless and need validation.

It was about this man who’s experienced demons in his life since he was young. Telling him to do bad things etc. I was like okay other than actually seeing and speaking to demons, I relate to this man. I always had a feeling they were there.
