depression,fmwzssd,t3_fxthns,1586455927.0,"honestly same. I was recently diagnosed with depression, anxiety and borderline personality disorder. My fave thing is painting. I used to paint freely all the time. Now, I struggle just to do my homwork for art school. I've found that booking time off in my day to do things has helped a bit, even though I end up pushing back the time to later and later, I usually end up doing it. I've also found that rewarding myself after completing tasks was helpful. Like I would complete an assignment then watch a movie as a reward. Its a tough one but I'm sure you'll find your way. Keep strong my dude :)"

OCADU,fgttzrr,t3_f0d8s8,1581109278.0,"What I understood at the portfolio clinic workshop is that typically minimum sketchbook drawings will be looked at for 10-15 seconds. They mainly want to see creative brainstorming and things like doodles. Nothing too detailed. I have been trying to focus on drawing from observation and exploring things like line quality. Also, I was under the impression that minimum pages for th sketchbook is 10-15 pages. Some people submit videos. 

Hope this helps and good luck! Hopefully I'll see you in fall 2020!
