It breaks my heart he lost even though Justin has been one of my favorite fighters since the mj fight and every fight since then. I told people for the last year Justin changed and that he was a force to be reckoned with and people would say oh he beat James Vick and Edson big deal. You could always tell if Justin actually stopped the bullshit with fighting an all out war till one man could no longer go on, if he got pst that he would be one of the best. With that being said I was hoping tony would win just because how much he has done to earn this title shot. But I know grab the was something special and he had turned a corner and it was good to see that play out, but it also left me feeling almost sick to my stomach thinking about how sad I felt for Tony. It now makes me understand why guys like woodley said they wouldn’t take another fight unless it was a title shot before he fought lawler. He honestly really didn’t deserve it at the ttime, but he put his foot down and he did get the title shot for it when he was only on like a 2-4 fight win streak (can’t remember, but I think it was 3) Tony should have done the same. Tony vs khabib was on hold cuz the corona virus and he fought again for no reason. Which is such a tony thing to do. I’ve been saying for so long now that if he ever did face khabib and somehow beat him, his title run wouldn’t be long because he fought so many damn people to get that title shot. Last night finally proved why tony was incorrect for taking this fight. He should not have done another weight cut 3 weeks ago. So many things tony did were absolutely stupid and now he’s 36 and likely behind Justin and also conor’s second shot at khabib if we ever do get tony vs khabib it’s not going to be hyped as it once was. Tony will likely be 38 by the time they actually fight and  khabib will probably Very easily beat him at that point. As a fan of the sport it just makes me so sad for tony. No fighter has ever been done dirty like tony was done countless times. Tony showed us one last time he was game as fuck to fight anyone at anytime like he always has. His team should have absolutely told him to not take the fight. I know they thought was the best in the world, but the guy had already won as many fights in a row as khabib. He didn’t need to fight this time. He paid the ultimate price and now we will never truly get them in their prime. At least not Tony’s prime. I truly tops takes off a few months, gets a good win and gets promised a shot at khabib one more time, but I just don’t think it will happenS khabib va tony is the fight we all wanted the most and we will never see it just because tony couldn’t wait 3-4 more months."

He’s a top 10 guys at 155 and maybe top 15 and 170. On the right night he can beat anyone (who is also a stand up fighter ala the wonder boy fight"
MMA,fqc0u1g,t1_fqbxhsi,1589247797.0,He is 6-1 now. This was his second fight. For guys with no names they are brought on for 10k show and 10k to win. You have to prove yourself before they just give you money. Absolutely nobody tuned in to watch him for any other reason than the fact that he was fighting Greg hardy. He got 12 k which is 2 more than most start with. You guys are acting like this dude is a veteran or something. The starting pay in boxing is like $500 but everyone always likes to bring up how fighters makes millions in boxing but never mention how 99% don’t make millions and a majority don’t even get 10k to fight and 10k to win. For people starting out the ufc absolutely is much higher than boxing and higher than all other mma promotions. Bellator also gives like 1k  to new people sometimes even less.
MMA,fqc0bax,t1_fqbx6g5,1589247493.0,"Jw but did you even know who Castro was before he fought hardy? I know I had never heard of him. I assume he’s a newer guy in the ufc and was fighting hardy because they knew he would lose. Whether you like hardy or not the ufc obviously value him enough to give him that type of money. Nobody knows who the fuck Castro is. A ton of people know who hardy is and a lot tune in for him which is why he opened the main card if I remember correctly. A ton of people hate him so they tune in hoping he will lose, but ufc keeps giving him winnable fights. I also want to point out heavyweights with a bit of star power are almost always paid better than almost any other division."
MMA,fqbzv4p,t1_fqbyozg,1589247233.0,He probably is the type that gets the same if he wins. Some choose to get less money overall by choosing to get the show money  (a higher amount on the show money but less money overall because no win bonus ). Others choose less money to show  but get a matching amount for a win. So who knows?
conspiracy,fqbmlzg,t3_ghpb1a,1589239833.0,"Also I just want to point out that I’m subbed to multiple doctors who talk about covid daily so idk why you are lying about this. I agree everything is all weird about gates, but no need to lie to get your point across. This sub does this way too much"
conspiracy,fqblzdt,t3_ghpb1a,1589239490.0,Bill gates could fuck his wife melinda on YouTube and they would show it for science.
Coronavirus,fqb3n6n,t3_ghmp6s,1589230010.0,dr fauci would know because he’s the new starting quarterback for the New England Patriots
nfl,fqb3j9p,t3_ghngu4,1589229955.0,Do the pats even know their qb yet? If so is he even good? I don’t get why they didn’t keep jimmy g if they had a feeling tom would be gone
Mafia,fqb3bo0,t1_fqaqjtj,1589229849.0,They prolly only “made” him so he didn’t snitch or something since they knew he wasn’t going to be around anyways lol
Coronavirus,fq7fhzn,t1_fq5auce,1589145711.0,It’s not just black patients. Many people have gotten treated poorly with covid
interestingasfuck,fq7ctmf,t1_fq5vtfw,1589144731.0,I’m pretty sure that’s a female with the white toe nail polish
worldnews,fq7a7bj,t1_fq606kd,1589143774.0,Uhhhh mers was from camels so I’m not sure where you got your info from?
worldnews,fq79uz4,t1_fq74ldc,1589143645.0,At what point has pigs caused a virus which caused human to human transmission since you keep comparing everything to pigs? Because the people are asking about animals more prone to spreading viruses such as bats and pangolins
MMA,fq76jpc,t1_fq751mf,1589142435.0,Notice how you ignore the bottom of boxing though.99% of boxers aren’t making millions either
MMA,fq74xst,t1_fq6l5ss,1589141846.0,People always say this shit. Yet there are boxers who make like $1000 on fight night. There are very few boxers making 3-5 million a fight
videos,fq6qsnz,t1_fq6pc6c,1589136594.0,he's a genius..... he jjust isn't great to converse with. i guarantee you if you had someone interviewing him who actually knew things about what elon is involved with it would be a completely different type of conversation.
videos,fq6qhpl,t1_fq6ocoq,1589136458.0,"no, he didn't say that at any point."
videos,fq6qfjx,t1_fq6nkc0,1589136428.0,he literally made his stock fall by saying tesla was overvalued and you people still see he does everything he does for money.
nextfuckinglevel,fq6pfzf,t1_fq6nvhf,1589135963.0,well yeah that makes sense because the guy selling stolen goods probably doesn't have someone to sell paintings too. obviously stolen apple watches is an item many people would buy.
MMA,fq6kwrm,t1_fq6k9we,1589133496.0,The ufc is a business.  Does he generate 10-20x what he makes right now? Just because he deserves it doesn’t mean they can just pay him that. They absolutely cannot take a loss to pay a fighter.
