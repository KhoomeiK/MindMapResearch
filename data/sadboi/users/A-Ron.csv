I believe if you just Enable the Policy to Store Bitlocker Recovery Information in AD - It still allows you to encrypt, and it will only attempt 1x to back the key up.

Yes, I would think that the keys will still escrow to SCCM properly. 

Or since this isn't a setting, the policy won't care? And both FVE and Used Space Only will be indistinguishable?  And both will show as Compliant ?

Or does the Bitlocker Policy change it to FVE? 

Im really trying to figure out the answer because we are in the middle of rolling out BDE using Task Sequences that's setting ""Used Space Only"" - I'd like to know if we are creating more work for ourselves down the road if we keep going before the inevitable move into SCCM Bitlocker Management .....

To manage BitLocker on devices after the task sequence deploys the OS, enable this option.""   - Ok, so if I was already using Bitlocker Management 1910, Id change that TS Step to specify FVE.

No, he didn't outright suggest everyone go out and try it......but having those words come out of his mouth at all is enough for endless ridicule. The man is an absolute MORON."
reactiongifs,foqwjt8,t1_foqvzqr,1588002083.0,It's because it's such an absurd and irrational thought that even the dumbest Grade 7 kid wouldn't suggest.......This is the POTUS we're talking about here.

lol, you can't defend your point, you just keep telling people ""watch the clip"" - They did, they even typed out exactly what he said.......and you just keep saying ""Wrong"".  Typical."
reactiongifs,foqodea,t1_foqnycf,1587997809.0,"It's okay, even though he didn't explicitly say ""TRY THIS"" his defenders still think its appropriate that The President Of The United States has such a stupid and insane thought, that he said in front of miliions of Americans....or that it was appropriate he was ""Being sarcastic"" (He wasn't)"

cringe,fohbklx,t1_fogfp8m,1587763232.0,"Just watch any of his pressers, all he does is deflect and blame.

Anytime someone questions his slow response, he just brings up how HE decided all on his own to close the border to China."
cringe,fohb7ou,t3_g7d4di,1587763060.0,"This makes it worse. He looks and sounds even stupider while he's trying to defend his already stupid comments.

lmao, him crossing his arms at the end is the equivalent of ""I'm taking my ball and going home"""
trees,fogfg2r,t1_fogcvos,1587751897.0,"Yea.....about ""pills"".

Last July I was prescribed a light does of Mirtzapine (15mg) to help with anxiety and sleep.  I can say there is definitely a Life Before & After getting this prescription.

It might sound counter-intuitive - but man, I've been so much LESS stressed since being able to work from home, so I stopped taking my pills thinking I don't need them.

I didn't think anything of it until my wife asked if I had been taking them....well we know the answer.

I feel like an idiot, but I also know this happens to a lot of people on meds like that. They think ""I'm better now ! I don't need them!"" - Well, I guess I hopefully learned a lesson and that I can continue smoking without some of the negatives.  Downside is that I feel like I'm taking the pills for the first time again, and it's kinda rough...major 'disconnected' and empty feeling :/

Thanks for the response ! Stay safe."
