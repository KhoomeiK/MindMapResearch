Yes, we need the economy but there is so much we could do that we aren't doing.

The problem with covid is that we just don't know what it is, really. For example, we're getting repeat cases now where *I work.*

Now, the lockdown should have slowed down its spread considerably. What you would expect to see is that once the shelter-at-home orders were originally lifted everything would seem fine for at least two weeks, this is because covid takes up to two weeks to show symptoms and everyone who was intially infected wouldn't be aware until then. The growth of the virus is exponential. I don't know if you remember but one of the big statistics that people were focusing on at the beginning was the doubling time of cases when this first started. If this is bad it will take a bit for things to get out of hand but once it has it'll go from seemingly nothing to overcrowding in hospitals (Which are now laying off all of their staff). Scary thought. Especially when there are now news cases of states manipulating statistics so that we aren't aware of what the extent of the infection.

Its just not good for anyone if we aren't honest about what is happening. More people die. No one should be against proper data gathering, its knowledge that will keep you safe if we're making the wrong choice re-opening."

I just looked on [https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/) and currently North America has less cases then Europe. You're probably right on per capita cases, I haven't see that data yet. I will point out a flaw though. The United is not testing adequately, largely because of Donald Trump and his stupidity. For example, I work in SF in a major inner city ED and we are only, just these last couple weeks, beginning to test the general public in a meaningful way.

A large part of Donald Trump's failure is in inadequate diagnostics. People are freaking out because we don't know the scope of the virus and we are not prepared with equipment. Additionally, we are being asked to shelter in place without being supported to do so, leading many to financial ruin.  A large part of the resistance to comply I believe stems from this, Trump is manipulating his base into skepticism through under-reporting of data and also taking away their ability to provide for themselves. If you keep people in a state of uncertainty and panic, it is hard for them to use their higher level reasoning to make educated decisions. It's fucked.

Back to the data. If you are going to compare two or more things you have to first agree on conditions that make those bodies of data similar. If you are going to make a statement like ""The United States is leading the world in Covid cases"" you have to define why the United States is similar to what you are comparing it to. For example, it is clearly absurd to compare the united states to the rest of the world as a whole. You are taking a relatively small thing against a much larger thing.

To a lesser extent, it is also absurd comparing a singular European country, like Italy, to the United States. Italy is 5.44 times smaller then the United States in terms of population. It is also far more dense.

This is called underemployment. We have a ton of jobs that don't pay enough so people are forced to work longer hours or more then one. If you look at this macro-economically its a method for business owners to extract more labor from fewer people, this saves them on overhead but at the cost of making the lives of everyone they improperly pay suck.   


Generally, capitalism unchecked will do this, extract more labor for cheaper and cheaper price as the executive team running the business work towards ""efficiency"" (I.e. getting as much as they can for the cheapest possible cost). They don't consider things from the human, only from the financial because that is their job. Philosophically politicians would move in and institute a minimum wage to check this and set a standard for what is market rate given inflation to protect workers. What has happened is we have failed to do this effectively for a long time. Why? Well, business is clever and they realized that they could protect their drive to do this if they over-employ the people who make the rules."

Everyone is like ""Duh Orinthane, thats obvious"" but consider the reason why. I think we assume that it is because we don't physically ""feel good"" and our body is unhealthy but as this thread is showing you are also treated differently based upon your physical attractiveness. I wonder if the mental health issues associated with obesity are also due to the social consequences of being fat and not just the physical ones. If its true many of the health epidemics facing our society, our over prescription of psychiatric drugs, our social alienation, suicide rates are greater contributed to by obesity and how it is dealt with socially."

BreakUps,fdi509z,t3_elb5u8,1578435837.0,"This is a very hard and complicated question to answer. Break-ups aren't specific to which ""side"" you were on. You and your ex are different people, were grown and damaged in different ways over the course of your relationship. This means your grief will be different and how you heal from it, likewise, will be different.   


I do think its probably best that both people take time away from others to sort out what went wrong in the previous relationship and to grow from it. Nobody leaves a long term bond without something to learn and consider, or some wound to heal from. People who jump into a new thing right after they've broken up with a serious partner may have their new thing work but that emotional energy that they haven't dealt with will show itself in some way, and they are leaving their new partner to deal with whatever way that is. They, also, are postponing the lessons their last relationship could have taught them by distracting themselves with a new set of challenges and rewards this new person offers. Complicated.   


There is no best way though, just your way."
quotes,fdaxrnn,t1_fd61ms9,1578251632.0,"I tried to be clear in not blaming the victim. What I meant by it is arbitrary is that it does not change the outcome by holding on to your victim identity at a certain point. Answering that question does not heal you. As someone who has experienced an exceptional amount of trauma and turned my life into something somewhat functional( that I’m proud of), I at some point had to decide to exercise my own agency despite what happened. I had to say, this happened and I had no control of it but who do I want to be now?

I think that is the great tragedy of being a victim, it is left to you to fix. 

I forgave op for assuming I had never experienced pain because they disagreed with my sentiment. I believe that was a statement meant to belittle my view by attacking my character and, in that way it must have been a challenging thing to hear for them. I forgave them for that reactive attack."

Theme? Life is a big question mark and, truly, nobody knows what is really going on here.

I see a lot of people argue that this means that you shouldn't have attachments because it hurts and we should avoid this. I, personally, don't agree.  I think hurt is inevitable and attachment is important to meaning, whether in relationships, actions, or career. I think what is important is that we exercise agency, meaning that we choose what we want rather then feeling compelled to do so. That we choose to rely and invest despite knowing that it is a transitory, elusive, and guaranteed to end  is what makes us human and living beautiful."

getdisciplined,fbyrq89,t3_eeph13,1577224561.0,"There is a really good post that was recently published about needing to find meaning in your own life.

Recently I've been struggling myself because so much of my life feels meaningless. I went through a break-up this year that was really hard for me. I almost committed suicide because of it actually, it was awful. The first thing I did post break-up was what most people on here suggest, create a framework of positive habits that will benefit you but there was something always missing and it wasn't sustainable. Why?

Because it's really only half the story. You can build a Ferrari but if you don't know how or where to drive it its just a pretty piece of polished metal.

It is imperative that you figure out what you want for your life.

Why? Because you have to find your own meaning or whatever distraction you find, whether it be a relationship or an opportunity, will only be a temporary relief until the next sad thing in your life happens.

How? Start asking. Find that first inkling of something that makes you just a bit excited about living and do something with it. It makes you happy when you think about drawing? Buy a book and pen and just doodle. You like watching documentaries about the 1920's? Read a book. Explore your interests. Maybe where it leads you is not your thing but its closer and it'll give you ideas on what the next thing is. Do that until you know. And guess what? You never have to be sure, you just have to be open to giving your all to what ever it is.

This all takes time. Part of your journey here is learning to how to be disciplined, the other is why you are disciplined. Be patient and kind with yourself. Be the person you know you are to yourself. It's a gift to be able to figure all this out , even if it takes your whole life and its so much damn fun too."
getdisciplined,fbf6xwd,t3_ecz1e7,1576803157.0,"I am coming back to this discipline journey after letting myself go for a while but I have some perspective on what you are going through and I hope I can help.

You are burning out. I know you think ""there is no excuse for not giving it your everything"" but there are two questions that are equally as important that you ask yourself ""What am I giving my all to?"""" and ""What do I need to give it my all?"".

Why?

Just for example ---> Your job. You are giving your job your everything but no one appreciates it. It sounds like you need to feel appreciated, it feeds you and makes you feel like what you do matters. Is it smart to give your all to someone who doesn't value you? Is it good for you to expend energy without getting any back?

No.

Above that, your idea of your life probably doesn't include a job like that. Your efforts should be focused towards progressing towards a life that you want. What is that?

Great question. You should answer it so that all of this work ethic you've been cultivating is used to empower you, not deplete you."

I wish I would have made changes in my life to make it easier for us to spend time together and really appreciated her. I wish I had know the words to say that I saw her, that I saw all that she did for me, and that I was grateful for all of it.

It's gone though and I let her go in love. If she comes back, well, maybe we get a second shot... but otherwise our time in each other's lives is over. All I know now, where we were when we broke up wasn't working and if it ever will... we'll both need to grow. I think you need to accept this. Your old relationship is dead and you need to be present and prepared for what comes next because it's an adventure that might be incredible and you'll miss it all if you only look at what came before."
