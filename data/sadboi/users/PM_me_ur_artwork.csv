Really starts you on the path of dealing with all your karmic baggage, aligning with your destiny path, and generally making room for new blessings and opportunities in your life. 

But because your north node will be conjunct the transiting south node, and vice versa, you may find karmic players or events, or past life baggage drive you into your new path in life.

Using that, how much does your current life reflect that? Are you doing what you were meant to do is this lifetime, reflected in your north node? Have you healed the wounds of your Chiron? Have you learned from the aspects of your south node?

And omg yay!! Twins! (Sorta) 

My birthday was Feb 24. It was also:

Sun, moon, Neptune, Mercury Rx conjunction Pisces Party‚Ñ¢ :
1. new moon (pro tip: a new moon is when the moon and sun are in the same sign. Aka when the sun hits the backside of the moon instead of the side that fades us)
2. Pisces ruling planet (Neptune) was/is in its domicile (aka Neptune was in Pisces) 
3. mercury in retrograde (mercury is its fall in Pisces, so the retrograde actually softens it‚Äôs blow of Mercury in its fall).

Here‚Äôs what I did:

1. Ran my solar return chart. I checked out the the transits and looked up how the next year was going to go for me. Based on this, I wrote a forecast for the upcoming year. 

2. Based on my forecast, I set intentions on the moment of my solar return. I set intentions for manifestations, and for guidance in times of trouble. I did this so that I could tap into the new moon and solar return energy to propel me forward this next year. 

3. Got a birthday cake, made a wish, and celebrated. DON‚ÄôT FORGET THIS STEP. This is probably the most important step. If you don‚Äôt celebrate your journey, your hardships and triumphs, and YOURSELF, then then the rest really doesn‚Äôt matter. If you don‚Äôt believe in your value, then the universe doesn‚Äôt either, and doesn‚Äôt acknowledge it. (Pro tip: if you really want to make the most of your birthday wish, really take a few minutes to envision it. Engage your senses of what it will be like to have it fulfilled, and as you enjoy your cake, keep living as if that reality has already come to fruition).

This is because they are ruled by the duality of good and bad, angel and devil, masculine and feminine, Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde. They can come off as bipolar or borderline, constantly swinging from one extreme to the other. Because they are the mutable air sign, their minds are always changing which can make them lack inconsistency, so this can make them appear fake.  It they aren‚Äôt!! They‚Äôre honest, say what they think and what they feel. They just have so many different thoughts and so many dualities they need to incorporate into one sense of self, and that can make Gemini‚Äôs seem bipolar or borderline. 

But that doesn‚Äôt mean that Gemini‚Äôs are bad. They just experience so much pain and still seem to maintain their composure and be the most fun, playful, jovial sign, that it‚Äôs hard not to develop different personalities that come out at different times as a coping mechanism. Because Gemini‚Äôs are so desperate to be seen as good and needed and smart and well liked that they tend to give people what they want to see, which can also create ‚Äúmultiple personalities‚Äù.

However, the same placement is not going to affect everyone the same way ‚Äî like how many people can have the same genes but it affects people in different ways.

Yes, your Virgo stellium (3+ placements in same sign or house) squares your Pluto (and Chiron) in your sixth. But it also squares your Saturn and and Jupiter in Gemini. 

So that may feel like you‚Äôre being pulled in 3 different directions, see sawing between what your career is, your health and well-being, and who you are at your core. 

So to answer your question, having a Pluto square your Virgo stellium isn‚Äôt in itself a bad thing. It more creates dynamism and energy that feeds back into a cycle of changing your thinking and mindset, a reinvention of yourself, or a complete change in emotional state. I‚Äôd honestly be more concerned with Chiron conjunct Pluto, as your Chiron is much more affected by your Pluto than your Virgo bits. Your Chiron and core wounds would create major paths and opportunities for change based on your vital issues you need to heal. This would be around spirituality, self-expansion and self-exploration, higher learning, and your health in those areas and service to others.

So although be rubbish at running, I‚Äôm enjoying it. And that that‚Äôs all matters. :)"

Speaking of which, my mum is from NZ, so I have dual citizenship. And as my moon is Sag, I just decided to give it a go for the heck of it. Don‚Äôt plan on moving back any time soon."
C25K,fgebbat,t3_exxkpw,1580695657.0,Well done. :) I‚Äôm scared of week 5. Any advice?
piscesastrology,fge65k6,t3_exjwg1,1580692242.0,"They say that anger is a defensive emotion for more painful feelings like hurt, sadness, and loss. 

And as Pisces, I‚Äôd say we‚Äôre too in touch with ourselves and too highly evolved to feel anger most of the time. 

So I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs pretty accurate hehe üôà"

My name is Chlo√´. I‚Äôm from the US but live in New Zealand. 

I‚Äôve always been low key into astrology, too (every fish is, IMO) but have gotten into it quite heavily within the past couple of years! So much so that I do is quasi-professionally now lol 

I love meeting other Pisces. We just always insta-bind over feeling things that OTHERS CANNOT EVEN FATHOM. 

Welcome!"

I don‚Äôt need a 10 minute break, I RUN for 10-15 minutes. Need about a 2 minute break. That‚Äôs why I thought originally that would put me at week 6. 

But because I‚Äôm going to be running outside rather than on a treadmill, I‚Äôd start out slow and get used to the pace of to running outdoors, and go from there."
AskAstrologers,ffixdw3,t1_ffiw5j9,1579985044.0,There are many factors in a birth chart that can cause shortness in a birth chart (just as there are many factors that can cause cancer in a person) so it‚Äôs just one of a myriad of things. I only listed that one because that seemed to be relevant.

AskAstrologers,ffe5dhl,t3_et4bzu,1579837133.0,"I have Lilith in the 7th. 

My understanding of it is that you are prone to victimisation in relationships. People that use and abuse you. Because Lilith is in your house of relationships, the darker, more abused/abusive lover is someone you deeply attract (Lilith in your descendent, to be precise). 

And given that it‚Äôs in Leo, you would have this natural confidence and charisma. And that attracts those who see it as a challenge, almost. 

But yeah. Victimisation in relationships is a big one for us with Lilith in the 7th. Yeah, Rihanna is powerful and magnetic, but she also was with CHRIS BROWN, THE INFAMOUSLY ABUSIVE."

AskAstrologers,ffb54hq,t3_eskcun,1579752045.0,"This is definitely a challenging layout of a chart to read. And one reason why I hate this website for charts. Because so many of of your planets are close together, you have to look at the tick marks for the placements of the planets rather than where the literal position is in in the chart. 

So your Pluto is in Scorpio is in the 11th house. Along with your north node. That would definitely explain part of it. 

But a bigger part of the equation I‚Äôd say is your sun, moon, Venus, Mars, AND MERCURY all being in the 12th house. That 12th house stellium, which includes two of your big three, and also your mars, would certainly explain to me why you have chosen the profession that you did. i.e., all that 12th house energy makes you live both in this realm and the next."
