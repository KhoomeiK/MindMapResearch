Idk much about this metabolic rates and stuff, but I have a broad knowledge of the thyroid and  the hormones it secretes.  if 1900 is low or normal, you can try eating a little bit of sea weed and supplement a little selenium (or eat a few Brazil nuts) to maybe increase metabolism. I don't think this is necessary though.

Just focus more on explosive lifts and keep the reps below 6 reps with higher weights. Then once a week run unless you really are conditioned to run multiple times a week. (You don't want to burn out mentally/ physically) Diet is key here, probably could easily shave 30 lbs by just changing your diet alone. Just drop all the shit foods out.

The legs are a huge muscle group and athletic wise very important yes? Another tip is when the legs and back get worked out your body should get a big boost of testosterone levels. I think it's good to get those boosts before you start working out smaller muscle groups, idk maybe it will help with recovery/ gains.

1 week to recover should be enough. Everyone is super sore after taking a long break, it just happens.

Also don't be in a hurry to get big. The male human body is at its peak at 30. Not 14, not even at 25. At 30, take it slow. Don't injure yourself. And with that being said, even after HS, keep lifting. Even after college if you go that route, keep lifting.

averagedickproblems,fo9km3j,t1_fo9k5q9,1587622275.0,"dude Im not gunna lie, thats an unusual girth. You have something to offer women that most guys can't. Don't sweat it, you're all set."
averagedickproblems,fo9kemc,t1_fo9fosr,1587622098.0,"Im short too and rock a 6 incher.  I just turned 30.  I just started reading this sub and I think im done too.

You are the chode master. honestly even with 5.5 length, a chode like that is something a women should enjoy, the fuck is wrong with these women man?"

Could be wrong, I hope I am wrong, but I'm starting to think it's a lie otherwise its cause a lot of problems for men and suicide rates would probably climb. Just my opion"

Maybe beating off depletes hormones which causes out penis to not become it full erect potential, same issue with all the blood having to be in the muscles maybe it has a negative effect on the penis, we can't get our fullest potential"
smalldickproblems,fnjts61,t1_fnjf1jh,1587006818.0,">It's bad for men, even worse for us tall men. We are expected to be packing so it's a massive disappointment for women.

If you dont mind me asking what is your length girth? And are you built and also have porn adiction?

&#x200B;

I ask to see if there is a connection between having big mucles and smaller dicks or maybe its beating off too much?"

Im pretty convinced taller dudes are more likely inclined to have larger dicks, i mean it really only makes sense. It's gotta be somewhat correlated with body size, this page basically just proves it, just look at these posts lol"
averagedickproblems,fn2cxvl,t1_fn2a6k5,1586584737.0,"I read a few posts there just to see what people say. Isn't it strange that that subreddit has a huge amount of members? Its bigger than averagedickproblems and smalldick. I can understand smalldickproblems being small because, its a minority of people. But average, by definition should have the most members. Maybe most guys with average dicks care less about size?"
averagedickproblems,fn2ckt9,t3_fydlet,1586584406.0,"Holy shit balls . . . these stats are actually right on to what researches said. 5.5 - 6.5 is the average length. Who else here is surprised in this? 

 Wait . . . No no no noooo, waiitt . . . someone is manipulating the poll data. thats gotta be it.  My six incher is below average, I mean, have you guys seen porn?"
averagedickproblems,fn2bt1w,t1_fmzqr4i,1586583716.0,its sad because I think the real average penis length is 6-7 inches. Google is freaking lying. Big dick problem sub has like 10x the amount of people in there than there are in here.
averagedickproblems,fn2a1in,t3_fyvpso,1586582157.0,if your length is like 6.5 i think thats by definition in average range but its the end of the average range.
