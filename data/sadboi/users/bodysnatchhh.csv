Nah, dude, you're already equating them within your rhetoric. If that helps you cope, that's great. But it sure as hell won't be the same for others. Groping IS sexual assault and I'm glad you're able to keep on living without repercussions. That's not true for many other folks. Please have the decency not to assume your experience is like every other experience of groping because every incident of sexual assault is personal and has different psychological effects. 

As you can see from my comment to OP, I shouldn't have to even mention her rape for you to feel compassion for her experience. She is a survivor of multiple sexual assaults. That framework helps her heal. I'm not going to be an asshole and devalue her experience. I'm sure someone who has survived a life or death situation would see the nuances in that situation and be compassionate towards her.

You also admitted you don't see yourself as a survivor, so again--I'd be happy to hear out the complexities of whether it is bothersome or not to someone who has actually ""survived"" an event. Like I said before, deciding on behalf of ""actual survivors"" is pretty darn self righteous. 

My original comment was intended to point out how OP was belittling getting your ""boobs squeezed"" rather than realizing sexual assault is actually quite traumatic. That to me, is more troubling."
unpopularopinion,fqut12d,t1_fqt4yd6,1589664134.0,Here’s the thing—I don’t have to mention the rape and I shouldn’t have to for someone to feel compassion. Groping is sexual assault. Saying it’s just someone having their boobs squeezed devalues the psychological pain of her experience. She survives her PTSD. She’s a sexual assault survivor.
unpopularopinion,fqt0off,t1_fqsz7op,1589625865.0,"So it seems you’re equating being groped to being hit on, which is why these might feel like minor inconveniences to you. But you surely don’t get to dictate or censor the way a person feels about their own assault, which is incredibly insulting to people who have been sexually assaulted. 

My roommate having her tits squeezed so hard that she cried out had triggered a memory of a previous sexual assault in which she was aggressively raped while being held down against her will. Does your statement about “having the audacity to compare your experiences to “real” survivors” dictate how she gets to reframe her narrative to healing as a survivor?

My bullet has become a log/tracker for all the data in my life—I tried having different sections in the front versus the monthlies, but it helps to have all my data divided by months. That way I’m less likely to forget to log information. I have a more detailed mental health tracker, a page for gratitude, a page for workouts, etc. I also like to see my progress in every category over the course of the month to find correlations, so monthly sections work best.

But I’d hesitate to discuss a rape fetish with my friends—that’s a much more taboo and loaded term. That’s not to kink shame either—I understand it can be healing for survivors which is why my boyfriend and I engage in rougher dom/sub play. But the connotation of the word rape is definitely more jarring and make it particularly strange to discuss with a group, rather than admitting to being into bdsm or power play.

As I’ve said in other comments, rape play is fine—in fact it’s a great way to regain agency after trauma. My boyfriend and I are into hard sub/dom play, and I understand as a rape survivor that it can be healing. However the “r” word is a taboo one and unless you’re with a trusted small group who is also into the same kink, there are ways to mitigate the shock of the word with other friends by using phrases like power play, rough sex, dom/sub, etc. Doesn’t at all mean he’s a “rapist” but the way she describes him announcing his kink seems like a red flag. It’s a more “knowing your audience” type of thing. 

However, because she said that idea scared her and she’s afraid of him, I wouldn’t even have the “honest” conversation—it’s not worth her mental trauma to bring it up if she’s already scared. Just seems like they’re not compatible and it’s not worth the trouble."

BeautyGuruChatter,fmyhq5w,t1_fmy4gx3,1586486449.0,"Also when I think of baking as a technique, I always thought more of Huda and the influencer videos she would repost on her page, even before she released her specific powder."
BeautyGuruChatter,fmyhkut,t1_fmy4v4b,1586486349.0,Same here! Also slightly convinced Colourpop indulged in the drama to avoid people asking when the sailor moon release would be re-stocked. They posted a lot of pastel looks during that time and a lot didn’t even feature colourpop’s eye colors. I remember they reposted someone’s pastel Morphe look and the only colourpop product that person used was their concealer.
BasicBulletJournals,fmuxnzz,t1_fmp2k4g,1586401206.0,"I also use a Minimalism Art notebook which I adore! It was ridiculously cheap price-wise and so much better than the fancier Leuchtturm I bought! 

This is such a great system--I've struggled tracking how I spend my day, but I love the idea of the timeline at the top that crosses over into the next day's spread. I might try this next month--thank you so much for sharing!"
muacjdiscussion,fmufks3,t1_fmtqwdk,1586390430.0,Yes! I can never get the felt-tip just right on my eyes as it pulls. I'd switch over from KVD if they made a brush-tip.
zpaletteporn,fmuf0uq,t3_fx9yt9,1586390117.0,Gorgeous! What's the burgundy and the other shade you hit pan on?
muacjdiscussion,fmuesaj,t1_fmtkfv3,1586389985.0,"Welp, I just googled those and I NEED the tawny and suede colors in my life."
muacjdiscussion,fmuegmt,t1_fmt7di1,1586389803.0,"Holy shit, me too! Imagine the finishes?! I have a weakness for slightly metallic sheen-like blushes in reds and plums and I imagine they'd look incredible in her style!"
muacjdiscussion,fmrjgeh,t3_fws6g9,1586325066.0,"Same for me. When I finally caved and bought it, it was my holygrail concealer--I was off of birth control at the time and had horrible acne and it covered--EVERYTHING--and never looked cakey. The match wasn't the best so I bought a summer shade and winter shade and I can't get the coverage to look right at all. They almost show up as sheer-medium coverage and so much redness shows through."
Gymnastics,fmo05my,t1_fmnwo54,1586240685.0,Agree so much! Feels like an easy way to correct a not so great landing

Ipsy,fm612tf,t3_ft7axj,1585784074.0,Anyone know if you can redeem multiples of something? I love the Youth to the People cleanser and have quite a few points to use.
muacjdiscussion,fm30oxu,t1_fm2z1x4,1585709930.0,It’s not my HG but one of the super few that work on me by giving me volume and length (no curl at all though). I only get the small travel sizes. I only use it for work but not for going out with my boyfriend. TMI but it’s definitely not sex-proof and it looks like I never had mascara on at all afterward—I like Benefit’s bad gal bang for that even though it’s too spidery upon application.
muacjdiscussion,fm30f3w,t1_fm2ngjr,1585709742.0,Same—mine was SO dry. It did create perfect little curled lashes but I had to squint into the mirror to actually see them. Also impossible to take off—so sticky and clumpy
muacjdiscussion,fm3056t,t1_fm2o5qo,1585709554.0,Yup same here. It actually hurts to get it off my eyes and just clumps them together. It’s wet and makes me look like I have lashes from far away but up close I have THREE clumpy spider lashes.
muacjdiscussion,fm17w44,t3_fs91v9,1585673591.0,"My roommate keeps inviting her girlfriend over all the time during the week--I get that there's no real schedule due to the quarantine (we both teach online classes) but my whole day is off and their energy just seems to take over the entire house. They're both pretty loud and I've been going to bed around 4:30am once they're finally asleep and waking up most days around noon, fucking up my schedule--if I even wanted to have one at all. She also stopped ""asking if it's okay if she comes over"" and I'll come out of the shower to find them already drunk on the sofa.

Both of them have been out running errands most days too and I'm terrified they'll pass on something that will prevent me from seeing my boyfriend (he's immune-suppressed and hasn't left his house since quarantine started)."
depression_help,fm14vlb,t3_fs9y03,1585672046.0,I sweat more during the day on Wellbutrin (it seems like anytime I get excited or wound up) but I've been getting bad night sweats on Lexapro

muacjdiscussion,floeuvb,t1_flnupx2,1585336948.0,Sadly the Stila doesn’t work on me. I’m in Florida so it’s humid all year round and it disappears from the corners (I’ve also got really bad dry eyes that constantly water! 😭)
muacjdiscussion,flnthm9,t1_flmc78m,1585325566.0,That's a shame. The tattoo liner was the only one that actually was a. easy to apply and b. stayed on forever. Still trying to find a dupe but no luck. Maybe you got a dud? I found that shaking it got rid of the grey color and made it actually black.
AmItheAsshole,flagxx4,t1_flaf45f,1584983659.0,"Or, maybe he should choose to be FWB with someone else who uses a more effective version of birth control instead?"
AmItheAsshole,flafdpx,t1_fl9skbc,1584982765.0,"If I got pregnant, I’d 100% get an abortion. But would I be terrified about getting it? Second guess myself? Probably feel remorse? Absolutely—it’s a big deal and traumatic on the body. She’s allowed to change her mind when things get real.

She’s wrong in forcing this man to stay with her (he doesn’t seem like a great person to keep around IMO) but he’s still responsible for making this kid by choosing to have sex in the first place. And also being in charge of birth control methods (of which the details are suspiciously lacking)."
