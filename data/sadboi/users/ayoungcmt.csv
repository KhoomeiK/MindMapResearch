She had claimed to understand mental health stuff because she has anxiety. Her response to my episode was so painful to me and we haven’t really seen them since and that was in January. I don’t even care. The whole experience made me realize that I am fine without shitty people. I am so blessed to have my husband. He is so wonderful and understanding!

I make my coffee with mostly decaf, but a little regular), and I use medical marijuana. I also found out that my folic acid and vitamin D were super low and those can harm your mood so I make sure and take those. The pot honestly helps so much! It helps pick me up if I get too low or it brings me back to earth if I’m super manic. It’s been an amazing tool with no nasty side effects. I will say, the thing that helps the most is being aware enough to recognize what I’m feeling and being able to talk to my husband about it. When you can name the feeling and realize what triggered it then you can more quickly move on. It took a long time to become more aware of my emotions, but now it’s easier to understand what’s going on. Keeping a journal has helped with this as well."
