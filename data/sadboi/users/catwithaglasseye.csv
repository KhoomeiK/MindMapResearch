So I anxiously waited another thirty mins and she still wasn’t done, so I got the head nurse on duty and she talked me through what to do while walking to her room with me and stayed with me to help the resident until my sup showed up an hour later.

I do this a lot in my job now. Set the precedent you care for the client and their safety, and will always be a safe space to discuss their issues with. But that doesn’t mean you’re going to praise their choices necessarily. 

Empathy is not the only tool we’re given. If it’s all you have I may suggest speaking to a professor or something. Are you bachelors or masters level? Hopefully direct clinical experience will help you. Therapy is not comfortable or fun.

Edit: wanted to add. Intent Vs Impact. Your intention of not being invalidating may still impact clients. You can be real with people once you’ve worked with them a bit and reframe questions to basically say “it’s not like that”.

Sounds like your having a rough time. I’d recommend talking to your therapist. If you don’t like them or feel connected I’d say to give a new one a try. It sounds like your having a go with grief related to your mom dying. A lot has been recommended here and while it’s 50/50 on if it’s clinically safe I can recommend that you’ve taken the first step in trying to ask for help.

Even if you can’t do much more try to do something each day that will help even a little. Try and eat. Hydrate yourself. Take a shower. Change your sheets. Run a comb or brush through your hair. Put on clean pajamas. Tell your friends who you used to go out with what’s going on. Ask for support. Support can even be someone staying in to watch TV and be a bum on the couch with you.

AskDocs,fjyskn7,t3_ffj3cr,1583703686.0,"Take a black marker and draw a circle on the outline of the redness. If it spreads beyond the black marker circle then it needs to be looked at. I agree ingrown hair/cyst. It looks dark under some of it and from other pics your hair is dark... this is why I think this. You can try and pop it if you want, but do so at your own risk.

Bug/spider bites would have penetration (or ""bite"") markings. Especially poisonous spider bites.

AskDocs,fjyrew7,t3_ffcgz3,1583702971.0,"I guess, how do you have the confirmed diagnosis of fordyce spots? have you seen a doctor/been told there is no treatment in the past? 

I would recommend doing that if you haven't already. I would recommend talking to your girlfriend about it and assuring her it is simply a cosmetic defect that you're very self conscious about. If you like/love her enough to lose your virginity to her then you need to be comfortable enough to speak to her about your insecurities."

Ive been in this apartment since July of last year, and dealt with this bullshit day in and day out since the day I moved in. The lead people upstairs are not entitled to stomp the fuck around all god damn day and night. I mean the dude walks so heavily I can hear him enter the \*building\*, for fucks sake."

*girl I’m so sorry we have to call management I can’t find my glasses so I can’t drive us home* 

And she stares at me for a second before she goes 

Didn’t your dumbass just have lasik???? 

And I was like oh shit yeah I did. My bad."
baltimore,fitw51h,t1_fir06k4,1582730667.0,I had to call 911 on a homeless man who I didn’t know was overdosed or not on N Calvert. I secured myself in my boyfriends apartment lobby before I called 911. He wasn’t breathing and had a needle still in his arm. The 911 operator kept asking me to go back outside and direct medics. Like ma’am I don’t know this man. I don’t know how rageful he will be when he comes too. That’s not a good look for me a 5’5 young woman. Like it’s literally 1 block from mercy. Y’all will see him

personalfinance,fhyr4ro,t3_f5ghkn,1581981898.0,There are many factors at play here. This post doesn’t have much information. You can look for housing assistance (HUD) but recently Baltimore City (for example) is no longer accepting new HUD applications. You can also look into what your insurance may help you with (Medicare plans of certain kinds help with independent and assisted senior living if you have long term care insurance) some charities also may be able to assist.

baltimore,fhg4ooc,t3_f2uh7q,1581558520.0,"It also can depend on the neighborhood you move into. JH (especially west) is in a rough area of the city surprisingly. However all the places you listed being Fells, Brewers, Canton are all very safe areas. Use common sense anywhere you go, but otherwise, its really not a big deal. 

Most places in the city have some sort of mouse/pest problem. That is a lot of issue I have seen and Ive lived a few places in the city. The best way to avoid this is to get an apartment that is not built stacked on top of one another (IE all the piping runs on the same line because all the apartments are laid out the very same). I have one singular mouse, and when I called the exterminator he said I had the cleanest apartment he'd ever seen in his some fifteen years of pest control. So, it sometimes isn't you. More so how macitence handles the issue. Ask the leasing office how they deal with it, because it is bound to happen in this city. I live in Northeast and its a little rough, now but its all about how you act around others. Dont be a douche and nobody will single you out. The outskirts of the city, as I have also noticed, tend to have more lot parking and less street parking. The city will give you a tag that allows for street parking though."
baltimore,fhg42km,t3_f2uh7q,1581558121.0,"In terms of parking tips? Maybe find a place that isnt max budget so you can put the extra bucks towards a reserved space/monthly rental in a garage. Some places do not include parking in the rent. What will you be doing for JHH? Some places offer ""public servant"" discounts. I looked into ""The Standard"" apartments in Mount Vernon and could have gotten a  discount for being a foster care social worker, however ended up finding a different place all together. It can never hurt to ask!"

socialwork,fg8a6pp,t3_exbjjh,1580613685.0,"I think about how I talk to my own therapist about it. I have narcolepsy, and sometimes it is trigger by the act of having sex which makes having an adult sexual relationship a part of my own issues with my self consciousness. I try and be the same with my clients if that makes sense? Their sexual dysfunction/trauma/etc. but i don’t allow clients to turn it on me or make comments about me. It isn’t about me anyway it’s about them! Which is what I say 

“That’s not relevant to the work we’re doing for YOU. Please don’t make that comment about me. It makes me feel like you don’t respect the professional work we are here to do together.” Preach the I statements, sis."

BeautyGuruChatter,fdsfbnk,t3_emddyy,1578701446.0,"Have to say I am kinda disappointed.... Its hyper specific to be like BUT HEY THIS ONE THING EFFECTS ME!!!! But how the fuck do you wash this? If the answer is to toss it in the washing machine, I dont have one. Therefore I would either ruin the tool, it would get unsanitary with the lack of cleaning, or I wouldn't be able to use it often. I just am trying to conceptualize how I would wash it because it looks very fluffy and almost like a really luxe bath towel. But I have to lug my towels to the laundromat when I wanna wash them (with everything else I own). Its just disappointing. These really luxe tools aren't made with everyone in mind. I can spray a cinemasecrets on my brushes and then clean them with a towel or use a soap and warm water in the sink, but this just looks to be too much. I like makeup, I wanna be included, Tati!!!"
personalfinance,fddmw0y,t3_ekl548,1578318148.0,"Hi foster care social worker here. Look into laws of your state. But usually the answer will depend on if the youth had a photo ID and is of certain age. Cash app cards are good now, and there is chime and mint which will send the youth a card. Big banks still offer student accounts but without photo ID won’t open them."
