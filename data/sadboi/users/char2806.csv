Anxiety,eu5qiz5,t1_eu5q79h,1563483128.0,"my periods are regular, i used to be on the pill which made them months apart and very light, but since coming off (a while ago) they are back to normal and they are heavy but that’s always been the case since i was younger and being off and on the pill hasn’t made a difference at all to the nausea. i also haven’t ever vomited from it, i feel like it might be psychological. i’m sorry to hear that - nausea is the worst!! i hope you feel better soon!"
