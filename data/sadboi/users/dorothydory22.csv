depression,fag6ply,t3_e8wf5e,1576041911.0,"(This just a suggestion /opinion) I don't believe there's anything like ""Being truly alone"".  I always think of why people look for friendship and compassion in other people. (i know we are biologically designed to but) there is another way of making true and loyal friends like animals I am a cat person but you can choose which animal you can connect with.

Read a good book. I am a big fan of Sidney Sheldon but you can choose your niche. I believe books are the best ""DRUGS"" in the world. you can let your imagination loose and travel other worlds and truly be connected with the characters.

play a sport. indoor or outdoor its a great stress relief, helps you stay sexy (makes your nest date easy).

I hope this helps. I know it hard but even a journey of a million miles starts with a single step. 

I truly wish you have a happy birthday."

1)Life of  Steve Jobs 

2)Life of Elon Musk 

3)Life of Jeff Bezos

4) Life of Jack Ma

5) Schindler's list

The first 4 are entrepreneurs who stared alone, went through years of struggle, persistence, and perseverance and reached the pinnacle of their respective fields. 5th is a movie that is going to give you a completely new perspective of life."
