SuicideWatch,f1arc1u,t1_f0yi7v7,1569303704.0,"It's not okay in anybody's head. We all live and we all love in a perpetual state of anxiety.  Life is not the happily ever after story that we been raised on. But it is so much more. It's blissful highs and it's mind numbing lows. I found out today that my cousin, a father and a husband and a brother and a son took his life. That's why I'm here trying to wrap my head around why in the world someone would see suicide as the answer to their sorrow. Fuck anyone that blows off your feelings with ""it's in your head"" bullshit. Believe me, they're just terrified to confront their own demons. Everyone has them. Some confront them, some deny then, some succumb to them."
