Catholicism,fp64cct,t3_gbgjw9,1588345833.0,"It sounds like your girlfriend does want children. For me it sounds like she is terrified of herself and anything that could happen, and is projecting that onto not wanting to have children. I've been where she is. I watched a friend very gruesomely lose her child during birth and I went through a years long phase of never wanting kids. Now I do want children. 

I'm not saying that is what your girlfriend is thinking, or will think later on. This is not a topic for us, especially when plenty of people on here do not know the mindset of what your girlfriend is going through. You, her, your priest, and perhaps a (religious) therapist need to discuss this."

HistoryMemes,fp3hzm2,t1_fp3f7sy,1588279636.0,"I don't even know where to begin with this. I also feel like this is useless, because I struggle to see if you are understanding what I am saying. Either way, here are some bullet points.

1. It's not ""dressing it up"" that is me being honest. South Korean's were under multiple brutal military dictatorships. Until the 80s (and esp after USSR downfall) the South Korean's wanted to be under North Korean government. The invasion did not begin until North Korea knew for a fact that it had the people's support, not just random people. It did as well.

2. Do you even know the massacre I am talking about? For Jeju it was years before the war, and it is now estimated more than 100,000 were murdered. If we talk about Bodo it happened before and during the war started, where the lower estimates have it at 100,000 deaths. Does it happening during the war mean that it is less impactful and telling of the South Korean sentiment? No. So that means it can be used as a justification, as that was a turning point on the ground for the people.

3. I know who R.J Rummel is and you happen to be misinformed on that number. That is the maximum amount of people it is believed Kim Il Sung killed. The amount is closer to 1.5 million, maybe. The number is more likely lower than that than high. However, like I said above, that is not relevant to the Korean War."
HistoryMemes,fp3clnt,t1_fp3bmu0,1588276968.0,"Korea was Korea before the U.S and USSR agreed to a split. I'm not sure why you are calling it ""conquering"" when all it would be is unification which the people wanted *at the time*. So it is not considered invading because the people of South Korea *wanted it* to happen. The U.S and the government propped up which killed far more than 100,000 (that was just one massacre) did not. 

North Korea was doing far better economically, politically they were more free, and the societal development was higher. That isn't true today, but it doesn't make it false then. I'm also not sure where you are getting the 3.5 million number? Are you referring the 1990s famine? How is that relevant to a discussion on the Korean War?"

HistoryMemes,fp1q4m3,t1_fp120ys,1588244252.0,"The U.S started the war by occupying South Korea and placing in the dictator we did. That was a militarized occupation. It included us militarizing brutal dictator Rhee who murdered likely far more than 100,000 people because they were communist in the South. Jeju, Yeosu-Suncheon, and more saw large uprising which resulted in deaths of ~40K total. These started without the North Koreans influence years before the war technically began. 

The North went down because South Koreans were *mad* and the average person wanted to be under the same government as North Korea. So yea, the U.S didn't ""invade"" (we kinda did) we definitely started that war."
