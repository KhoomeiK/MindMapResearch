depression,fi2sfr4,t1_fi2jzsk,1582087761.0,I‚Äôm taking hydroxyzine 50mg and it doesn‚Äôt affect me at all. Both my parents have been diagnosed with ADD so I probably have it.
AvPD,ffxvw0x,t3_evt4nm,1580333450.0,I feel the same exact way.

AvPD,ffa9dvg,t1_ffa8k20,1579730439.0,"I would‚Äôve had that reaction whether I was at my optimum or not, sadly. It‚Äôs also happening more often, and more intensely. I always avoid interacting with people because I know they will be rude or show disapproval towards me. And it keeps happening and I never get proven wrong. It makes me feel so hopeless."
AvPD,ff4o0kk,t3_erh9oq,1579568270.0,"I‚Äôm so grateful for this subreddit. If it wasn‚Äôt for you guys I‚Äôd feel like a complete alien, and terribly alone and misunderstood. Everyone here is so kind, gentle, and understanding. We need more of that in this world."

GenZ,fc4y0i4,t1_fc4bdoa,1577433322.0,I remember YouTube blowing up in 2007 when the  ‚ÄúLeave Britney Alone‚Äù video by Chris Crocker went viral. The whole idea of ‚Äúviral‚Äù videos started around that time.

GenZ,fc48y5s,t3_eg3dsh,1577409842.0,"I feel closer to millennials than ""zoomers"", honestly.  People who have clear, distinct memories before the year 2005 should be put in a separate generation, imo.  2005-2007 were years of a technological explosion. A new era. YouTube, Myspace, Facebook, emerged around that time. I can clearly remember a time before social media, but my brother born in 2003 can't, and my sister born in 2011 definitely can't. I guess it just depends on the person."

GenZ,fbzu5ol,t3_efdgjp,1577261699.0,North Korea has been doing this for decades. Don‚Äôt let social media scare you into thinking that this is a new and credible threat. All NK does is send empty threats to coerce us into lifting sanctions on them. Yawn.
hsp,fb2piyi,t1_fari6ba,1576455319.0,Yes I did.
hsp,fb2ocyi,t1_fayypox,1576454707.0,that makes sense. Both my parents are being treated for ADHD. I probably have it.

AvPD,f9j0uhj,t3_e51nsg,1575351786.0,Yes. I know exactly how you feel. I have all features of a schizoid except the indifference to others opinion or criticism. I think it's common for those with AvPD to have most features of SPD

AvPD,f7j769o,t3_dwgqvd,1573771923.0,This just happened to me a few minutes ago. I was being harshly criticized for a question I had. I deleted the entire post and cancelled plans I had tonight. My day is ruined.
AmazonFlexDrivers,f7izn1f,t1_f7izd1c,1573768160.0,"Okay, boss. 

I can tell what kind of person you are in real life."
AmazonFlexDrivers,f7iz1gc,t1_f7iym7c,1573767885.0,"I wasn't asking about time management. Don't inject your snotty opinion on something I wasn't even asking about. The question was about the email I received and returning packages to the warehouse. I could say plenty of shit about you, like how your grammar sucks and you don't know how to properly utilize ellipsis. But it's not relevant to the conversation."

AmazonFlexDrivers,f7ieccu,t1_f7ie17u,1573758104.0,"The email I got from Amazon goes against that, though. The email was about late deliveries and not going past 9PM. I usually finish delivering all my packages even if I go hours over the block, but that email basically said I shouldn't."
AmazonFlexDrivers,f7gvxal,t1_f7gvvha,1573720413.0,So I guess I ignore the rude workers at the warehouse? Not sure why I'm treated poor for doing what Amazon is telling me to do.
AmazonFlexDrivers,f7gvd3k,t1_f7gv3rk,1573719541.0,"There's 2 other warehouses in the area, but I don't know how they feel about packages being returned. Not sure how to find that out. The workers at the warehouse I returned the packages to were being a little standoffish. I got the vibe that I was doing something I wasn't allowed to do (even though Amazon told me to return them after 9pm)"
