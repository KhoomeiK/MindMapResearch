TsukiAdventure,fesu84g,t1_feqs4m6,1579369034.0,really? aw there isn‚Äôt a diary entry about him  stargazing :(
insaneparents,f9vuc00,t3_e75p6x,1575679970.0,"i never understood why parents are okay with destroying the stuff they bought for us (and the fact that they actually complained about spending their money on us)

when i was 13, my dad snatched my phone from my hand the moment i got home from school. he threw it hard on the floor. picked it up again, and threw it again to make sure it's physically damaged.

all because i came home 5 minutes later than he ‚Äúestimated‚Äù. 

he also did the same thing to my younger brother‚Äôs remote controlled car just because my brother kept playing it in the living room. my dad bought it for my brother for his birthday. he complained it was expensive but it didn‚Äôt stop him from destroying it. and my brother was only 10."

TravelHacks,f1vly1b,t3_dapock,1569772755.0,"Skyscanner usually shows you who are selling the cheapest tickets for the day and most of the time its from a third party‚Äôs website. I would recommend you to do a quick research on the site that‚Äôs selling the cheapest fare. if it‚Äôs reputable (eg: expedia) then you‚Äòre good, you can book the tickets. if not, i advice you not to risk it and just purchase the ones from Thai Airways."
insaneparents,ezy5jn7,t1_ezxfwh8,1568258398.0,I second this. I'm 25 and my mum finds it hard to accept the fact that i'm all grown up; an adult who is independent. Even claimed that i should give her 80% of my paycheck from my full time job because i don't need that much money YET at my age. And she earns 3 times more than me :)

i cried the moment i read this. this is so true. it truly is a struggle. i‚Äôm 25. it took me so long to realise how toxic my mum is. i have been NC for 11 months now and have never regretted the choice. better days are coming for you üíó"
EntitledPeople,eugnvlk,t1_eugdnzy,1563811558.0,oh yes! forgot to mention about the points/credit you receive when you leave a review. those credits makes a difference on top of the discounted tours and tickets ;-) ooo i‚Äôve never heard of KKDay - will definitely check them out! thank you!
EntitledPeople,eugcxkh,t1_eugbq8j,1563805321.0,wow that sounds like a process but i'm glad you managed to buy the tickets!! omg YOU'LL LOVE IT! (put aside a lot of $$$ to spend there hehe) i'm so excited for you!
EntitledPeople,eug6b63,t1_eufgulz,1563801112.0,i didn't get to buy the tickets from their site because for some reason they only accept japanese credit/debit cards. i went to tokyo disney twice! and those two times i bought my tickets through a third party website which is soooo much easier and convenient. i'm not too sure if it is available in your country but the website is www.klook.com and there's an app too! i've used it to book tours and activities in japan and it's really reliable! hope this helps :-)
singapore,etwty99,t1_etsz606,1563283995.0,"hey i bought mine there back in 2017! still kept the receipt for it. i did buy the bundle but i exchange the games to get zelda and mario kart. costed me a total of $711. console was $549, zelda was $79 and mario kart was $83. 

hope that helps :-)"
