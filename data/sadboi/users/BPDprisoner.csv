You have her smile.

Many thanks to your beautiful mother for her contributions to the medical community and to all of her patients and their families who have and will benefit from her tireless efforts.

I always fail to understand how everything happens for a reason...especially with losses like this. But that forces me to examine my beliefs.. and I do wholeheartedly believe that there is more beyond this, and that our loved ones never really leave us, but watch over us and all that is important to us from a safe distance. 

She is always with you. 

May you and your family find peace and may your mother‚Äôs legacy live on forever. God bless."

I have done a lot of DBT ($$$$$$$$) and tried many different medications and none of it has worked for me unfortunately. I can say medication usually makes it a lot worse.

I don‚Äôt believe that full recovery is possible because it is a personality disorder. Some traits can‚Äôt be worked away. But management is possible for sure. You can‚Äôt expect someone who lives w a personality disorder their whole life to ever do a full 180 and change. Tendencies will still exist - but the borderline can manage them so it appears to others that they are ‚Äúrecovered‚Äù. A manageable life is possible."

relationship_advice,fmfub12,t3_fuo8w0,1586034996.0,"In my experience, I can‚Äôt be friends with an ex if I think they have feelings for me. It is cruel to lead them on because in their mind, any form relationship could grow to become more. It makes me uncomfortable to be around an ex if I feel that they are still holding out hope. When I‚Äôve truly let go of an old love, I have no desire to be their friend anymore. I wish them no harm but when I‚Äôve moved on, I truly have.

It pains me to say that I think he shares some feelings for her still. Otherwise he wouldn‚Äôt have said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know‚Äù. He would have said no. 

On the flip side, I don‚Äôt care if my bf is friends with his ex‚Äôs. I dno. Maybe I‚Äôm always prepared to let go if I have to. But I can‚Äôt say that for sure. I just know that you deserve better than to commit to someone for 3 years and not have them do the same. 

If you guys aren‚Äôt isolated together, maybe you should give the relationship space.
