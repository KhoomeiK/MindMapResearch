After that he made me belive that I can stop, and I'm trying ever since.. We've been together for almost 4 months, I'm clean since December 6th.
Even when relapsed before, he didn't get angry or upset, he just asked me why, and kissed them..
And he told me that as long as I tell him and I'm not keeping it from him as a secret, he knows I trust him and it doesn't hurt him. He wants me to stop, for myself, not because of his reasons. He wants me, to get better..
I love him so much.."

Sooo once he said to me that: ""When I look at my wrists, look at them as they are his wrists.. when I look at my waist, look at it a it's his waist... because it hurts him as much as I did it with him...""
I've never taught about my sh like that.. but when I did, it stuck in me.. I could never do it to him..
