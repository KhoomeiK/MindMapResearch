conspiracytheories,fkzups4,t3_flhufm,1584680954.0,"This was “apparently” in Illinois, where I live. The national guard put out a statement stating that they are not transporting any vehicles into the city, nor have the last minute. Here is the statement. They also stated that they know they are not COVID-19 related. 


“There are a lot of rumors going around about the Illinois National Guard being activated to enforce a quarantine in Chicago or other areas of the state. Some even have video of a train moving military equipment near the city.
We confirmed with our logistics officer that we haven't had trains moving Illinois National Guard equipment through Chicago in more than a month. These are not our vehicles. The military moves equipment all the time. This has nothing to do with COVID-19 response.
The Illinois National Guard has activated 60 troops for COVID-19 response so far. The majority of these (about 45) are medical with the mission of setting up a drive-through screening site. The rest are planners, including medical planners, and liaison officers.
We have liaison officers embedded with the Illinois Emergency Management Agency and the Illinois Department of Public Health. There has been NO discussion of using the Illinois National Guard to enforce a quarantine. There has been discussion of transportation, food distribution, construction (renovating mothballed hospitals to make them functional again or building temporary hospital space) and a few other missions - but nothing about quarantining the city of Chicago or shutting down highways or any of the other wild rumors that have been circulating! People are understandably anxious about coronavirus. We will let people know as troops are activated for additional missions. Please remember, the National Guard is a community-based organization. We are your neighbors, your friends, your relatives, your co-workers - we are you. We're all in this together and we'll get through it together. Stay safe!”"

I went up on a roof that didn’t look so steep from the ground, but when I got up there it was about a 10 pitch. My hands were sweaty as it was about 90 degrees in July where I was working. I ran up the roof with no regard on how I will get down. When it was time to finally come down I had to scoot myself down with my hands on the burning black shingles. I made it about two feet and moved into a valley where I can maintain my position because the shingles were too hot to handle. My hands were fried. Luckily my partner was on the ground, I told him to just hold the ladder the best he could and if I fall off do the best he can to catch me. (This gave me a sense of security). I moved out from the valley and just let myself slide down and crash into the ladder. Luckily the gutter saved me from falling and I got down safely."
