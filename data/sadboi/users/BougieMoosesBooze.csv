service_dogs,fr3cepj,t3_glgo23,1589854401.0,"I’m actually really glad you posted this!  Often times it *does* seem like PSDs are frowned upon here.  Sometimes when I read through some of the posts, it makes me feel like I don’t deserve a service dog...even though my doctor suggested it as part of my treatment plan.  Like, as a tool IN COMBINATION with other treatments. I think for me, I start feeling like this when I see people start tearing apart someone’s list of PSD tasks, or when someone uses a word such as “anxiety” for example and people start jumping on it as a red flag as if all anxiety issues are the same.  (Someone with OCD or PTSD might not have the same issues with people asking questions about their SD as someone with social anxiety would, for example.)  I think the hard thing about psychological disabilities in general is that not only are they usually “invisible”, but usually they’re accompanied by low self-esteem and impostor syndrome...making people who have them extra sensitive and insecure. 

That said, I’ve never *personally* had anyone be rude to me here when I asked a question, and I don’t think all of the discouraging comments are necessarily bad. I do think it’s important to explain the pros and cons of living life with a SD. I do think there can be issues if someone gets a dog (any dog) when the other people at home aren’t on board with it...or when a person can’t take care of it, as that’s how so many animals end up being given away. I do think that for some people (and especially first time dog owners), getting a breed of dog that is notoriously difficult to train or physically incapable of doing the tasks it’s needed for, for no reason other than “I think it’s cool” probably isn’t the best option.  Stuff like that, it totally makes sense.  If it’s a concern that a persons condition might not be considered a disability, or could be made worse by having a SD, it makes sense to suggest the person bring things up with their doctor. For that kind of stuff, I get it."
CPTSD,fqzw0nf,t3_gli0f0,1589776773.0,"When I was in my early/mid 20s, what a lot of people saw when they looked at me was an annoying overachiever. In reality, sometimes I get into this weird over productive perfectionist mode as an anxiety response. I also wanted to avoid and escape being at “home” with my abusive parent as much as possible, so I spent hours in the school library studying and doing school work. I worked 2-3 jobs (depending on the time of year) making shit pay. I used most of my money to pay for my car, some to pay for a cup of coffee so I could have somewhere to sit and work on my own projects when I wasn’t in the school library or working, and some to pay for a gym membership so I could not only spend time working out, but also have a place to shower when I slept in my car or was “too drunk” to drive home and “accidentally” fell asleep at someone’s house. I tried to save money, but if there was any left, my parents usually took it. I wasn’t allowed to eat my parents’ food so usually I lived off ramen noodles, instant stuffing mix, and any food I could scrounge from one of my jobs. Sometimes I would go to Wal Mart at like 2:00 A.M. just to use the bathroom and so I could walk around the store and pretend I was shopping for my own house. 

To be honest, I think the two things that really kept me going were **1)** the fact that staying busy enough to basically be “on” 24/7 numbed out basically all of my emotions and **2)** simply just keeping my “eye on the prize”. In other words, I just kept telling myself that if I could just get through this situation and endure the shittiness for a few years, eventually I could have a house where I was safe and have real food.  Sometimes it really felt hopeless and impossible. But I think the reason I got through it was because I kept telling myself it was temporary and reminding myself of my “why”."

So, this might sound screwed up, but I can’t remember *ever* really masturbating “for fun”.  Sometimes when I felt really lonely and undeserving of love I would do it almost like a punishment, then cut myself and think, *this is what you get*.  I’ve never really been able to tell anyone that before because I didn’t think anybody could possibly relate. So, thanks random internet stranger, for making me feel less alone."
CPTSD,fqowzkr,t3_gjtp0r,1589527429.0,"Yes!

Even though I’ll be feeling like crap, I have constant thoughts that I must be wrong about it or that there’s no way it can actually be as bad as it is, as well as intense guilt and anxiety for taking the time to rest. 

Once I broke a bone and didn’t go to the ER because I assumed I was “making a mountain out of a molehill” (ugh I hate that saying).  My SO came home an hour later and took me in and I spent the entire time in the waiting room apologizing and waiting for him to get mad at me for wasting his time and costing us money. He seemed genuinely shocked that I was sitting there with a broken bone and this was what I was worried about."

I always have to be listening in case a serial killer tries to sneak in. I check door and window locks multiple times throughout the day, lock the doors even if Im just going outside for a minute, and am constantly “on guard” of my surroundings whenever I leave the house. When I first moved out into my own place, I would grab a knife and search every hiding place multiple times per day, ESPECIALLY if I had left the house that day.  After my SO moved in and we got a big dog it eased up a little bit, but I still have to check the locks (albeit less often), can’t have any distracting white noise so I can’t listen for footsteps, and am ultra aware of my surroundings when I go out, especially if I’m without my dog. I’m actually thinking of training my dog to search rooms for me so I can feel a bit more at ease."
raisedbynarcissists,fqmjzpq,t3_gjhlfw,1589478700.0,"Congratulations!  But ugh, I’m sorry you have to deal with that. I was in a similar position when I was your age, so I know how much it sucks. 

Unfortunately yeah, that’s what I had to do. Over time I just realized that no matter what I said or did, my nparent would say it was wrong (the only exception being in front of other people, when it would make them look good to be fake proud of me for something I did). After I eventually got an “adult job” and moved out, it still gave me so much anxiety to even see my family, so I had to go VLC. 

After I finally got out of that house, was actually able to see friends and date without interference, and started therapy, I started to realize that no matter what I did or how well I performed at something, I couldn’t have pleased my nparent because the problem wasn’t *me*.   My immediate reaction to a problem is still to automatically think everything is my fault, but in reality the problem is that *they* are shitty people who constantly need somebody to scapegoat and control. Anything I did didn’t matter at all. Even if I was born somebody else to the same set of parents, the only difference would be that I might be the GC instead of the SG."
CPTSD,fql1u2s,t3_gj8ugp,1589443346.0,"Yes!  When this whole thing first hit, it was like a wave of calm washed over me. I knew this whole situation was something to take seriously, but I felt okay about it. I felt almost relieved that I had an excuse to have my groceries delivered, not see family, and stay home entertaining myself. Now though, waking up to all the idiocy and selfishness day after day is really starting to wear on me.  I’m sick of everything in the news. I’m sick of hearing everyone’s conspiracy theories. I’m sick of their attitudes. Normally when I start feeling like this I just get some exercise or go off the grid for a bit and it gives me a chance to refresh, but now I can’t. All the idiots who are normally at stores and on Facebook are also congregating in all the parks, crowding and littering on all the hiking trails, and refusing to keep their distance or watch their children and dogs on sidewalks. 

I don’t mind isolating or following any of the safety precautions, but I feel like I can’t even responsibly do the things I’m still legally allowed to do because idiots are ruining it. I’m sick of it. I am so, so sick and tired of it."
CPTSD,fqb0zmr,t3_ghmkcx,1589228684.0,"Did I write this in my sleep?!  Haha yep, I 100% relate. It’s actually kind of nice to know I’m not the only person who has this problem, because then it’s not *me*. 

In general, I’m a person who thrives on structure and routine. When I feel bored or low self-esteem, I get on the same kind of kicks where I have to rigidly structure everything. I write out my schedule and to do lists, plan out all my meals and calories and workouts, set goals for myself, you name it. I’m good at sticking to it and for a while it feels good.  It feels safe and I like making progress. 

But then, something will happen that throws me off and it immediately sets off a panic spiral.  Don’t have what I need to finish a work project and waiting on a reply from someone?  I panic that I can’t get it done when I said I was going to and it ruins my day.  Friend randomly comes over and brings junk food?  Dinner plan goes out the window and I end up bingeing and then hating myself for a week for losing control.  **I can’t. Let. It. Go.**

I think for me at least, it all boils down to the fact that I’m not just upset by the inconvenience like most people seem to be. I’m actually upset because it’s been burned into my brain that I am bad and all things are my fault, so all of these minor things just feel like proof of that “fact”.  I interpret bad things happening or people treating me bad as “because I deserve it” and “because I did something wrong” and not just as bad or annoying things that happened. On top of that, I grew up in a household where tasks had to be done *immediately* when they were assigned no matter what and if I made a mistake or took too long or whatever I was punished for it. I still have that same panic response even at a place like my adult grown up job where literally no one is actually hovering over me waiting for me to do something wrong. My brain basically interprets all authority as variations of my mom and problems as always entirely my fault."
raisedbynarcissists,fq9vsc9,t3_ghnpgy,1589208029.0,"Hey!  I’m only a couple years older than you, and had a lot of the same fears plus some...(thanks nMom for telling me I would get committed and tortured!). Overall it’s been helpful for me, but it’s kind of a long process. 

My first experience with therapy was in a church setting, where I was basically told I had to go by a pastor during premarital counseling. Although the actual therapist was nice, it wasn’t a great experience. I was still living with my parents at the time, and the SO I had at the time treated me kind of shitty tbh, so it was actually impossible to do the kinds of things the counselor wanted me to do (set boundaries, actually learn to communicate, etc.). It felt like none of the work I did was working because they were all skills for dealing with *reasonable* people, and since it was in a church, it was all “bUt FaMiLy” rather than encouraging me to escape. Since it was at the church of the person I was dating at the time, there was also this weird undercurrent of me having to be “accepted” by them and “allowed” to get married. It really felt like I was jumping through hoops and failing for nothing. In the end me and the guy broke up and I eventually moved out on my own.)

My second experience with therapy has been better. As an adult living on my own, I was able to choose a therapist who I wanted to see and use my own money/insurance to cover it. Starting therapy was not like, immediate relief which sucks, but slowly it has been unraveling all of the shit that has happened over the years and learning how to actually process it. Sometimes it sucks because I have to talk about things that are embarrassing or difficult. Occasionally I’ll be put off by something my therapist says and have to bring it up in the next session. But overall it’s been instrumental (along with reddit subs) at helping me to understand that I was basically “created” into what I am through years of surviving an nparent as opposed to just being “born bad” and having “erratic emotions” and “depression and anxiety” for no reason like I was taught to believe. 

Obviously that’s just my experience. There are good therapists and there are shitty ones. But if you’re able to find one you like, you can always tell them what you’re afraid of.  I did this with mine. I straight up said, “Look, I’d like to tell you what happened but I need to know if there’s any way nparent is going to find out?  I’m really afraid of that happening.”  It gave the therapist a chance of reassure me and explain things, and get a better understanding of that relationship’s effect on me. (For the record, they did not tell my parents lol.)"

Honestly, I hate being around babies because I don’t know what to do with them. I’m always paranoid I’m going to do the wrong thing. I think deep down being around a baby reminds me of when my younger sibling was born and how I was treated by my parents. 

Seeing other people obsess over a baby puts me off for a couple reasons. Sometimes it reminds me of the kind of people who get a puppy and then when it starts to grow up and be less cute and they realize you actually have to train and take care of it, give it away. Other times it makes me think it’s all an act they put on in front of people to make themselves seem great and hide what they’re really like...like my mom. Other times it reminds me of people who make a huge deal about patting themselves on the back for being a parent and act like it’s “the most important job in the world” to shove out a crotch fruit and act entitled AF over it.

- Work as many hours at as many jobs as possible and don’t spend my money on anything. (For food I would live off of anything I could get free from work, and if I bought anything it was usually ramen, stuffing, oatmeal, or instant potatoes. Not healthy but it was cheap and I could make it easily at work.)

- Only bought clothes or books if I needed them and then only from thrift stores. 

- Asked someone outside my family for help creating a budget and also researched rent so I could have an idea of what my expenses would be and how much I would need to make to cover them.

To me, it always seems like for most people it’s more of a situational problem, where they are reacting to the problem or insecurity they’re actually facing. For us, I feel like the problem is more that we were shaped into thinking we’re bad and the cause of all problems and deserve bad things to happen to us.

Whenever I see that kind of stuff, my brain does the same thing. It tells me it’s ok to eat what I want, but it’s like as soon as I start eating, I can’t stop and it turns into a binge-tastic free-for-all, and then I feel gross and need to purge. It doesn’t help that right now I’m overweight *because of* my bulimia, so the food guilt is even stronger. 

I think the worst for me, though, is the people who talk about body positivity but are super skinny and post “healthy” versions of recipes, like putting tomato sauce on a zucchini and calling it a pizza. It’s like cool, you’re way smaller than me but struggle with thinking YOU look bad and eat an ultra-picky and very low calorie restrictive diet. Nice. How am I supposed to feel about myself when I see that?  

It’s also so hard not to read the comments where 2/3 of them are people saying that body positivity is promoting an unhealthy weight and lifestyle and criticizing the girl while the rest are people cheering them on.  The conflicting messages get to me. 

Honestly, I don’t understand why we can’t just normalize being different shapes and sizes and ethnicities and whatnot without making a big deal about it.  I love it when I see insta accounts of people who do certain sports or hobbies and are just regular looking, regardless of their size. It keeps the focus on the activity instead of on who should or shouldn’t look like what or showing off someone’s body. (Not that “showing off” makes someone a bad person, but we all know it’s triggering.  There’s a huge difference looking at a pic of someone wearing a thong bikini doing a booty pop and sucking in with their hair and makeup all perfect vs. a pic of the same person standing naturally wearing clothing appropriate for the activity with everyday wash and go hair.)"

Ugh, THIS!  Every time it happens this is EXACTLY what it does. 

I’m so glad to hear that therapy is working for you!  I agree, getting the stories out is oddly helpful, as is connecting some of my more over-reactive feelings to the specific memories.

One word of hope I can offer though is that none of my friends/acquaintances who are around my age thought their 20s werent what they thought they would be, and enjoy their 30s a hell of a lot more.  For me personally, it took a lot longer for some things to play out than I wanted, some things didn’t play out how I wanted or expected but it didn’t end up being a bad thing, other things haven’t happened and I don’t know if they ever will, and a lot of good things that I really wanted and almost gave up on hoping for (or did at some point) eventually did happen, even if not on the timeline I was expecting. Like, I used to *dread* my 20s being over, but I don’t miss the level of uncertainty and instability I had back then a single bit. I’m not that far into it, but so far my 30s has been the first time in my life when I’ve been safe enough to actually try to heal."
TalkTherapy,fmrn1lb,t3_fwv6r6,1586328366.0,"Just...wow. This is completely ridiculous. You’re definitely not wrong for being upset. 

>It is actually a common reaction from clients who have a trauma history to find it difficult if session/s is changed. 

Way to put this all on you and take zero responsibility right from the get-go.  This doesn’t sound like her having an unexpected serious emergency come up one time and you having a meltdown over it. Eight times in three months is a lot of appointments to cancel. Not only is that flaky AF, it sounds like she has a complete inability to set boundaries in her own life and then blames other people when they react or confront her about it. (I’m not a therapist, but I know people like this and it’s something that drives me nuts.)

>Unfortunately Ive had to reschedule apts in past as ethically it is my responsibility to not proceed if I feel it's not it the best interest of my client to go ahead with session (if I'm sick or have family matters to attend to). I like to be emotionally present for my clients so it's not fair to clients to go ahead with session if I'm not in the best place. The reality is that sessions may be rescheduled at times. 

After reading your other post, this statement really stuck out to me. 

One of the excuses you mentioned before was her kid having a cold. If she’s not able to be emotionally present because her kid has a cold, it sounds like there’s something going on with her in her personal life and like she shouldn’t be taking on clients, especially ones with trauma or any immediate needs.  

For things like taking her kids to their dad’s, that’s something most people would normally schedule *around work*, unless it was an absolute emergency. Or, if a specific timing *was* necessary for this that conflicted with normal work hours, most people schedule appointments around that time so they wouldn’t have to be cancelled or rescheduled.  What’s the point of even scheduling appointments if there’s a 33-67% chance they’re going to be cancelled at the last minute?

Both of those, as well as a lot of the other excuses you mentioned in your other post are things that come up in most people’s lives normally. They’re not something like an accidental injury that came completely out of nowhere. So again, it seems like she’s either dealing with some kind of emotional baggage in her personal life that she hasn’t mentioned that’s making her unable to handle her workload, or she’s really awful at setting boundaries and then blames it on others instead of taking responsibility. 

>It's also important your mental health isn't dependant on me, as part of our goal is building your self worth & self reliance.

Ummm...what?  I mean yes, it’s on you to do the heavy lifting and “work” that therapy is supposed to be, but the whole point of you seeing a therapist is to **get help** doing that.  This kind of sounds like blaming again. Eventually the goal is to be able to build yourself up and not need a therapist, but that’s why you’re there!  You showing up to appointments **at your scheduled time** is what’s expected and it’s part of doing the work.  Having that block of time set aside for you is literally **the whole point of scheduling an appointment**. 

Again, I’m not a therapist or some kind of expert, but this is NOT how my T handles scheduling. Honestly, I wouldn’t even treat a friend or acquaintance like this. Not cool."
CPTSD,fmpr5b2,t3_fw6ts1,1586285825.0,"Ugh, I totally get how you feel. I didn’t even know I had trauma (I just thought I was moody and unreasonable and bad my whole life because that’s what everybody told me) until like a decade after you, so I think maybe you’re ahead of the curve. My entire life has felt like an uphill battle. Everything I do or accomplish seems like it’s twice as hard for me as it is for a “normal” person because not only do I have nobody to help me, nobody to turn to for comfort when things go wrong, to pay for everything on my own, and am constantly dealing with my mental health and emotions at the same time.  There are a lot of times when I really just want to give up because it feels impossible to me. Here are a couple of things that kinda sorta help me: 

- I once saw on a blog a quote that said that “healing is not linear”. I constantly try to remind myself of that blog post every time I start to feel like I’m backsliding, because it helps me understand that having bad days and even relapsing is all part of the process.  Writing stuff down, like achievements, struggles, milestones, breakthroughs, all of it helps me to see the ways I’ve worked through it in the past. 

- Keeping lists of things I want to do in my lifetime, and NOT putting deadlines on them, but working towards them all the same. For me deadlines = failure when things don’t work out how I wanted or expected even when I put the work in. Not having a deadline reminds me that I can always keep trying. I go to this list whenever I can, and especially if I feel bored or dead inside. It reminds me to do what I can to make those things happen, so even for a time it feels like I have a purpose, and like I’m alive. 

- Remembering that it’s ok to pick low hanging fruit. Just because one thing I’m working towards might take a lot of time and work and trying over and over and maybe never even happen, there are other things I want to do that might be more achievable during that season of my life. So, I just work on what I can at a given time. 

- Realizing that I don’t have to adhere to the “normal” life timeline that other people expect me to have, or even do the same things. Once I realized that I could let go of those expectations and instead focus on creating my own, it took SO MUCH pressure off of me. 

- Going to therapy. I was terrified to do it when I was younger, but ever so slowly, it’s helping me to decode the mindfuck that is abuse and recognize which thoughts were learned vs which ones are actually real. 

I don’t know. To be completely honest, I still struggle a lot, but those are the things I wish I had known to do 10 years ago.  When I was in college I didn’t know that if I wanted to travel, I could just...go do it.  That’s how much control my abusers had over my mind.  But, I’ve managed to do a lot of things in the time since I escaped that I never thought I would be able to get to do. I might not have everything I want, and I might get beaten down whenever I get rejected or jealous and triggered AF when I see someone else get something “for free” that I wanted or even worked for, but when I put my life down into words, I’ve come a long way. 

I guess the whole point of this comment was just to let you know that you’re not alone, that it’s okay and normal to feel like it’s a constant struggle because for us it is, that it’s okay to work towards the life you want instead of the life you’re “supposed to” have, and that it’s possible to still “get somewhere” no matter how hard it is or how many times it feels like you failed or what other people say."

This actually makes me sound pretty awful, but I can be pretty cat-like when it comes to sex. As in, I only want it on my terms. When I want it, I *really* want it, and when I don’t, I can be really weird about it. That said, I don’t usually want it very often. I’ve had flashbacks during sex, and at times, I even find myself starting to get angry over foreplay because being touched brings me back. When I *do* want sex (or any physical touch or comfort for that matter), rather than seeking it from my SO, sometimes I self-harm as a way to fulfill that need, which I think probably stems from other abuse/neglect trauma.  

I never feel like I can talk to anyone about sex because I don’t know anyone IRL with this problem. My friends will talk about sex toys they like and such and it’s like I can’t say anything.  My SO knows a little bit and tries but doesn’t completely understand, so the only person I’ve ever opened up to about it in any real capacity has been my therapist."

I’ve had dogs OFF LEASH running at me and kids whipping right past on bikes and those stupid scooter things while the owners/parents say and did nothing.

CPTSD,fmipiof,t3_fvieri,1586114283.0,"Ugh, I’m sorry you had to go through that. 

I’m in the same boat (not with those specific conditions, but just in general), so I can definitely relate. Growing up nobody ever believed me whenever I was sick or injured. Having bronchitis and/or asthma attacks was just me “trying to get out of cleaning your room”.  I literally did not know that you weren’t supposed to workout or with strep throat or play sports with broken/bruised bones because I always had to do it growing up and thought it was normal.  When I was in elementary school I had a head injury that caused unconsciousness and memory loss, and after it happened, instead of taking me to the doctor my parents left me home alone to go shopping. SHOPPING.   

So yeah, now as an adult, whenever I get sick or injured I feel this constant need to seek reassurance from other people to prove that I’m actually sick and need to rest (which I feel guilty for doing). The worst part is, a lot of the time my SO or friends will tell me I’m probably fine because they think it will make me feel better and be able to “mind over matter it”, when in actuality it makes everything worse because I feel like I’m being dismissed and ignored and gaslit all over again. On top of that, I have this need to constantly check things on my body over and over and over again to see whether or not I’m imagining whatever I’m concerned/anxious about or if it’s actually real. It’s exhausting and it makes me feel crazy. 

As you can probably guess based on what I just wrote, I don’t really have much good advice to offer since my own coping mechanisms are...less than ideal; the point of me commenting was mostly to let you know you’re not alone. The only thing I can think of that *does* actually help somewhat (for me) is to track all of my symptoms and thoughts/feelings each day in like an app, or a journal, or a planner, etc.  It doesn’t actually make the feelings go away, but it *does* validate me later on when I look back on it and realize that yes, when those things happened I really *was* sick.  And the times when it *was* just anxiety, I can usually kind of see that too based on what I wrote down."

Now that I’m older, I get triggered AF anytime I get hurt or don’t feel well. No matter how shitty I feel, I can’t believe that my injuries or illnesses are real, so I try to push myself to “act normal” instead of taking care of them and seek outside reassurance (which usually results in other people telling me when I’m fine when I’m actually not), then end up not getting better for a long time because I keep going about my normal stuff instead or going to the doctor or resting. Then I get angry at the people who try to reassure me for gaslighting me just like my parents did because they were wrong and brushed off my concerns. Then I feel stupid for having relationships.

A couple weeks ago I wrote a breakthrough post about finally realizing that all of the “bad things” about my “personality” were actually just learned behaviors from my trauma and not actually “me”. The first response I got was, “Have you ever even actually researched what trauma or PTSD is?”.  I felt too stupid and anxious to respond or to wait for other responses, and ended up deleting the post. 

Another day, someone did one of those “I’m sick of hearing people saying X” posts, and it had a ton of positive responses. I asked for clarification on what they were saying and explained how the thing they were talking about was something I constantly struggle with no matter what or how hard I try. I received several validating replies from people in the community, but the OP basically told me it was MY fault I struggle with the thing because I “choose” to “put myself” in that situation. Their comment was later deleted, but it still got to me. It still triggered the “everything is all my fault all the time” thoughts.

On a slightly different note, I also recently saw a post in which the OP was struggling in dealing with the pandemic and an overwhelming number of the comments were basically just invalidating the OP’s viewpoint. While I actually agreed with what the people commenting were trying to say, and honestly believe it was coming from a place of good intention, I could see why the OP got upset and deleted their post.  In this case I don’t think anyone was being troll-y or harsh or ill-intentioned, and I don’t think everyone has to agree on everything or feel the same way to still be supportive of one another, but it seemed like a lot of people were quick to say “yeah but think of it the opposite way” without taking the time to empathize or offer solutions to the OP’s  problems or something first.

OCD,flseu40,t3_fquoh0,1585440533.0,"Wow, I struggle with the exact same thing. It’s awful, and I totally get you on how debilitating it can be. I don’t know how to stop the thoughts, but I have found a system that helps me have more of an ability to get things done. Here’s what I do:

1. What I’ll do first is write down all the things I want to accomplish in a notebook or something. So, learn x instrument, play x sport, draw x picture in x medium, etc.  I don’t put deadlines on the goals, but I will tell myself that I have to work towards it for a certain amount of time before I’m allowed to give up. 

2. For each thing I wrote down, I’ll write down a few bullet points of things that sort of break down what I need to do to accomplish that goal. (For example, for learning guitar you could break that down into chords, scales, picking patterns, strumming patterns, songs, etc.) 

3. This sounds kind of weird and hippie-ish, but once I have my lists, I use them to set an intention for the thing I’m sitting down to do *before* I start to do it. I always try to pick an intention that is not subjective, so I can’t “fail” at it. So for the guitar example, I might choose to learn one new chord, or play through all the chords of a song without the strumming, or play through a song I already know 5 times. For an art example, maybe I want to be better at cross-hatching, so my intention would be to create a value scale using that technique. Or, maybe my goal is to take one photo every day, regardless of whether or not it’s any good.

4. All of the tiny intentions sound boring and pointless at the time, but when I make it a point to do them consistently (maybe once a day or once a week), they start to add up. Eventually I start being able to cross off the bullets on my list for each goal, or eventually, even reach the goal. (Using the music example, maybe that would look like practicing one scale for 15 minutes each day until it’s easy to play confidently, then picking another scale, and doing this until you can check off being able to play all of them.)

Like I said, this doesn’t really get rid of the bad thoughts, but doing it this way gives me a bit of a different outlook on doing hobbies. Removing self-imposed deadlines reminds me that I can always keep trying; just because I didn’t do something perfectly the first time doesn’t mean I failed at it forever. Breaking something down into smaller pieces makes it easier to track progress. Setting intentions I can’t fail at helps remind me that practicing a skill is a step towards an achievement, and that the “bad days” don’t mean I failed forever because I can always try again. Telling myself I have to work at something for a specific amount of time (maybe once a week for a year) keeps me accountable, but when things get hard and I want to say “fuck it”, it’s helpful to know that I can always stop if I still hate it once I’ve put my full effort in for that amount of time. 

Not sure if it will work for you too or not, but hopefully this is at least a little bit helpful.  Good luck!"

So basically, he ghosted and self-isolated based off of fears of what people would think, when in reality I actually miss him and so do the other people in our friend group. You never really know what people are thinking unless they tell you. 

>This whole narrative I get stuck in my head also adds to my fears that I am just too 'obscure' and 'weird' to fit into society in any meaningful way. I have seen a lot of CPTSD sufferers voice this so I'm sure that this is a common trauma response! Doesn't make it any easier to deal with, though.

Oh yeah.  Based solely on appearance, I check all the boxes of being your typical average basic white girl, and I still struggle with thoughts like this. I’ve never felt like I really “belonged” to any particular subculture or social group, I constantly think and feel like nobody likes me or thinks of me as a person, and I almost never feel understood or listened to IRL. Totally normal way to think in this case!

That said, I think a lot of people don’t know or understand what it’s like to be trans because they haven’t experienced it before. People react to what they don’t understand in different ways. Some are probably curious to hear your story or want to ask questions. Some might be afraid to ask about it directly because they don’t know how and don’t want to come off as rude. For some, they might see you as inspirational. Of course, there are others who are just going to be mean about it. Either way, how they react says something about them, not you."
raisedbynarcissists,flogghv,t3_fq2i81,1585337831.0,"I grew up in a religious nfamily. I wouldn’t say it was hardcore religious, but we went to services relatively regularly and I also went through the whole curriculum of classes. Even though I was never really forced to go, I think in a way it still messed me up. 

My church had these workbooks you had to do where there would be a Bible story, things to memorize, questions/activities, etc.  I think for a normal person maybe it would have been fine, but for me, I interpreted a lot of the content in the context of the life I was living. So, I would hear things like Commandment #4, and things about turning the other cheek or not seeking revenge, anger is bad, and that Jesus (who I’m supposed to want to emulate) knew people were going to try and kill him, but let them do it anyway. Also he starved himself in a desert. I basically interpreted a lot of the message as “just give up and let other people hurt you”.  On top of that, I always felt like the overall message was saying, “Jesus was perfect but he had to die and it’s all your fault!” which is pretty much exactly something my nparent would say to me, the SG. 

As I started to grow up, I think a lot of it really fed into the mental health issues i was developing from growing up in an nhousehold. For example, whenever I made a mistake or was yelled at for doing something “bad”, I would purposely starve myself because I thought it would help make me “good”.  When I was anxious and desperate for good things to happen, I would do prayers or religious rituals over and over because I wanted to feel protected. Things like that. 

Now that I’m a little older, I don’t know what to believe. It makes me afraid to completely step away from it because I’ve been molded into believing that doing this is “bad” and I’ll be “punished”.  I’m afraid to explore other religions. I don’t know if anything else that involves memorization or performing any rituals will hurt my mental health and recovery in any way. The whole thing is just really confusing, and I struggle a lot with it. I guess that maybe deep down, I can relate to having some sense of desire for spirituality, but I struggle a lot with “religion”. 

Anyway, there’s my perspective."
CPTSD,flkvulc,t3_fpfuh0,1585248646.0,"Wow...this is actually a really interesting way to view our current situation and I think it might actually explain why I keep feeling so upset and hopeless when it comes to reading the news.  

Now that I’ve been in therapy long enough to gain a little bit of insight and understanding in regards to my past, this makes a lot of sense. It explains why my first thought is “what can I achieve in order to solve the problem” followed by a sense of complete hopelessness when I realize I’m actually powerless and then want to run away. It explains why so many of the people around me either seem to worship him and the party in general to the point they can do no wrong, while others seem to be looking for any way they can to fight it and implement change, while others act completely apathetic or like they care but not enough to do anything. It also explains why I keep getting affected on an emotional level. 

If there’s one thing I’ve learned in therapy so far, it’s that every time I get really upset, it’s pretty much always caused by something that mirrors my trauma. This actually gives me something to think about."
CPTSD,flhoz0m,t3_foux2a,1585166771.0,"That’s basically it, yeah."
CPTSD,flhobii,t3_fov3ja,1585166426.0,"Maybe not everyone, but I’m getting really sick of seeing the sheer number of people who do not give a shit about anyone but themselves and are proud of it, as well as the number of people who are incapable of rational thought or thinking for themselves but seem to seriously believe they are smart AF.  It’s like nobody cares about actually dealing with situations or solving problems, all they care about is being “right” ... even though half the time what they think is right has no basis in fact or reality."
CPTSD,flhjimb,t3_fovfsl,1585163852.0,Yeah. I struggle with most grooming tasks when things get bad. I’ll basically only shower once every few days and throw my hair in a bun with a clip and just leave it like that so I don’t have to brush or style it. I never bother to pluck my eyebrows. I wear the same thing every day if I bother to get dressed at all.
raisedbynarcissists,flfu2zn,t1_flfsoik,1585117822.0,"Yep!  I think you’re right. Mine constantly threatened to kick me out and said how horrible I was, but when I finally said I was moving out for real suddenly everything I wanted to do was wrong and bad and dangerous."
raisedbynarcissists,flfmrlg,t3_fogubm,1585110858.0,"Mine did this too. It’s like, yeah just what I want, to put myself through 8 years of school and collect hundreds of thousands in debt to have a stressful job where I have to look at gross things and touch germy people, all so I can live with my nparent forever!  Sign me up!"

CPTSD,flcflg1,t3_fnt7iu,1585029044.0,"I’ve been called emo, goth, and Daria by random people many times throughout my life. The sad part is, I wasn’t even cool enough to belong with the goth and emo kids."

CPTSD,flcedmr,t1_flc59mq,1585027840.0,"**Exactly this!**

Growing up I was abused/neglected emotionally *and* physically, and always made out to be the scapegoat and reject. I basically learned that I am the cause of all problems, nobody likes me, and because of that I’m ungrateful and don’t deserve anything. Since I lived in a controlling household, I was almost never allowed to see friends. I had basically zero privacy, so if I tried writing notes or going online, all my stuff was snooped through. If I did ever say anything to anyone about what was going on, people just thought I was exaggerating or making things up for attention, which only reinforced everything I already thought about myself. 

How am I supposed to not feel anxious or depressed when the only thing I “know” is that I’m trash who ruins everything when I’ve never been told otherwise?  How am I supposed to not “let” things get to me when I have literally nobody to turn to ever to comfort me?  The only thing I knew I always had to make me feel comforted was the self harm I constantly did and hid, but of course, of those people found out they would still just say I was doing it “for attention”."
CPTSD,flabo8w,t3_fnazau,1584980676.0,"My parents were the same, and my marriage is also the same. Sometimes it makes me feel really unwanted because I basically have to beg my SO to do fun things with me, have sex, or pretty much anything that isn’t gaming or eating in front of the TV.  I talked to my therapist about it, and they pretty much think it’s the other way around, that the dynamics of the relationship are triggering my mental health problems and digging up old feelings from my past that I’m reacting to. Since me SO doesn’t really understand, it then comes off as me being unreasonable and overreacting."
CPTSD,fl9a1eq,t3_fney3e,1584946525.0,"Yep. I get really angry by this too. I spent years being gaslighted about my abuse and never believed by anyone, and being told “get over it” or “let it go” or “forgive them” triggers those feelings of helplessness and confusion and denial all over again. 

I’m not saying that forgiveness doesn’t have a time and a place, but you can’t force forgiveness. You can’t forgive someone just because you’re “supposed to” in order to be “good”. And why does this have to be on someone else’s timeline?  I feel like when that happens, you can *think* you’re forgiving someone, when in reality all you’re doing is either gaslighting yourself or repressing everything.  Being able to tell it like it is, feel the feelings that need to be felt, work through the thoughts, and figure out where to go from there without having the expectation of forgiveness burdening you is really the only way it doesn’t seem fake to me."
