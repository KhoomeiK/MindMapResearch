Perhaps you can find solace that i have been working on crafting great female characters and have many varied types. Even as a man I want the girls around the world to have good rolemodels through stories. What I want is to have strong and independent female characters in my stories but i also want to convey that independence and strength doesn't have to come from being alone. I try to convey that, as a pair, a man and a woman can make each other stronger abd improve each other. I also want to convey that not all strength is the same, and if you aren't the kind of person to be a fighter, there are other ways you are strong. I want to show that sometimes strength is having others around you to support you. So I want to show all these different kind of interesting female characters that can all be strong in their own ways.

I hope that makes sense."

The root of this problem is that i have severe depression and want to die so i use the vidya to distract myself from the pain but I don't want to bore you with the detail of that. I'm simply being objective here and using anecdotal evidence from my own experiences to prove a point. The longest I've gone without playing a video game was probably the week when i was 16 in the hospital with a kidney hemorrhage, i also tried in 7th grade to go a week without gaming so i was helping the contractors build our pool all day, but i broke at day 6 because i was so bored and there wasn't any work to do on the pool at that point. The problem is i just have nothing else to do tbh. Most things are really boring to me and i need to be engaged with something.

dataisbeautiful,fiovb83,t1_finvtdo,1582591831.0,"A reasonable response, but again, i think you're missing the mark a bit here. Firstly, I'm 99% sure there has never been a proven connection between declining grades and vidya, i don't really know where you got that from but i've never even heard it mentioned. If one's grades are declining it is simply up to them and or their parents to be responsible and put limitations where needed. In fact vidya can be very educational. Because of all the time i spent on runescape i know a lot of things about mining, smithing, cooking, etc that other 11 year olds would probably have no clue about. I've also learned an insane amount of history from certain games like the Total War series. As for social development, I also highly doubt that as well, even assuming they're a shut in who only plays singleplayer games offline, which most people aren't, if they were exhibiting that kind of antisocial behavior to begin with, again it's another underlying issue. Assuming they're more on the side of normalcy though, they'll be playing vidya online and probabl;y talking to friends on these games as well. I've made a lot of incredible friends on vidya, some have even lasted a decade and counting. In high school I was extremely antisocial because I had severe social anxiety. I did my school work, didn't talk to anyone, tried to be as reserved as possible. In fact, if it weren't for games like Halo Reach in high school i probably would have had virtually no social interaction, so again, can't say i believe that point. Bottom line here is that vidya are not inherently bad, that's all there is to it. We could go back and forth but I feel i should have sufficiently proved my point."
dataisbeautiful,finp5pa,t1_filx3ku,1582567542.0,"I wonder why that is? It couldn't possibly be due to the fact that quality of life has gone down, wages have stagnated, cost of living has skyrocketed, college has become insanely expensive, or in the last 30 years our technology has advanced so much that one's entire perspective of the world is different."
dataisbeautiful,finon33,t1_fim6rlx,1582567241.0,"That's a common misconception. There is no empirical data that suggests video games can cause addiction, or are even any more addicting than any other form of media. The biggest problem with this false statement is that it leads people to focus on a scapegoat rather than get to the root of the issue. If someone is playing video games all day for 16 hours straight some might claim they're addicted, like they did when i was a kid, so now you've labeled this person as a vidya addict and aren't going to think of any other possibilities for their behavior. Turns out, and I didn't learn this til i was past 20, i just have mild autism, so i hyperfocus on things i'm interested in. Imagine if I'd been sent to some rehab facility for vidya addiction when in reality i just hyperfocus due to autism and furthermore, get highly irritable when I'm unexpectedly interrupted or forced to stop activities, not because of addiction, but again, because of autism. People need to stop scapegoating vidya for everything and start looking at the deeper issues and what's really going on, because scientists still can't prove there even is a vidya addiction, since, well, there isn't. Sure, it's easy to get sucked into a game, you know what else is really easy to get sucked into? A really good book, a deep conversation with a friend, a mindblowing TV show, etc. We get sucked in because it's FUN, and we enjoy doing it. Yet when someone binges an entire season on Netflix for a week we don't claim addiction to TV, or when someone reads books nonstop for hours we don't claim they're addicted to reading. Another point is that addiction relies on withdrawl, if you stop playing vidya for a week you're not going to go into withdrawl like you would for drug addiction, because again, not a real addiction. Vidya has long been the media's scapegoat for them to blame all our problems on because it's gaining popularity so fast and also because it's relatively new so it's easy to pick on."
