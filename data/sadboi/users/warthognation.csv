SuicideWatch,fc22caa,t3_efra7r,1577337624.0,"merry fucking christmas to you too. i’m really sorry man, the homophobic parents part stuck out to me especially and that sounds so frustrating. i’m totally down to talk if your still online.

i also wanted to add that you can call crisis lines confidentially (you don’t even have to give them a name) so you won’t get hospitalized unless you want to. if that still feels like a no go but u want professional help you can text 741741 (in the us) for a text line if u don’t wanna talk out loud, which is 100% confidential as well."
SuicideWatch,fc21nve,t1_fc21eut,1577336900.0,"i feel like i’ve posted this a lot of places now, but it really rang true to me when i heard it. 

christmas sucks ass because in commercials and stuff it’s portrayed as this perfect holiday where families come together. and that’s what it feels like if you go online or anything because nobody is posting about being lonely on facebook. however, for lots of people, especially those dealing with loss or loneliness, christmas isn’t that. just remember your not alone this holiday season."
