AsianParentStories,fqwc8yi,t1_fqvoas1,1589699352.0,"I think it’s good that you’re at a place where you can forgive your dad. However, I will say, how can you beat something you truly love like that? With people like this, they mostly have warped sense of what love is and their duties as a parent on top of their own unresolved luggage. I’m not saying to harbor resentment and hate but I really don’t think you truly love your child that much if you beat the ever living shit out of them. Kids are just that: kids. Innocent and often fragile beings. They’re meant to mess up and make mistakes but by being abusive, there never how to react normally to those mistakes because the abuse. Some of these parents need some serious self reflection and apologize to their children for treating them less than they deserve. All love is not perfect but should strive to be like that one bible quote: 

            “Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. Love never fails” (1 Corinthians 13:4-8)."

filipinofood,fq7vkx8,t1_fq6qe61,1589153104.0,"I’ve seen Indian food being posted here in the past and no one questioned it either. On another note, although this is a small thing, sometimes this is why I think the Philippines and some Filipinos have no backbone and always try to adopt another better known culture rather than being themselves. We don’t even want to preserve our own culture, much of which has already been destroyed. Sad to say, but hey, that’s what centuries of colonization will do to a people.

Of course, this in no way means to push out all foreign foods and sneer at it but it’s just something I notice. It’d be different if you did filipino ver to make it your own but generally not the case.

Imagine trying to post a halo-halo in an Italian food sub and see what kind of reaction that will get.

retroactivejealousy,ff8kyh3,t3_es7213,1579683517.0,"I’m reposting this from a comment I made on someone else’s post about a similar issue:

“Same. I also have my moments. I guess you really have to think about WHY you feel that way.  Takes a lot of thought and patience to reach the truth of it. So sit yourself down and have an honest and slow conversation with yourself.

-Do you think it’s indicative of incompatible values?

-Is it because they have more experience than you and you think they might be comparing you in the back of their mind?

-Do you think that the relationship you have now with them might not as special because they had had a relationship with others prior?

-Are you afraid that you are just not good enough for them even though they haven’t said anything or done anything to prove that thought?

I know things like that can really mess with you especially if you’re ruminating on it for a long time, it can lead you down a rabbit hole that might never have a satisfying answer other than going back into a time machine and making them your boo before anyone else can lol. I get it. So I would ask yourself has my partner ever done anything, truly done anything to make me question their love for me? Do they show through actions that they do? Is the specific circumstances truly a dealbreaker for me or is it something that I can work hard to eventually just be ok with? There’s no need to be happy and jumping for joy about their past but you need do accept all of them, even the difficult parts, if you want to truly love them and have a future. If the situation was reversed and my partner was feeling the way that I was feeling, how would it make me feel if my feelings were true and that this relationship has been the best and I never thought about those exes and how would I wish that they went about it finding solution for it?

I’ve had the same feelings as you and I’m also trying to work through them so I just think about all the things that my significant other has said to me before that proved that they loved me truly and wrote them down so that I didn’t have to ask them again and again and again because that can damage your relationship with them. I know it’s hard for people to understand, especially these days, why someone might have this feeling but if your partner also loves truly loves you, they can help gently guide (NOT by constant reassurance) you and hold your hand through the process of sorting out and calming down your feelings about it. Try your best to love your person and focus and hold on to that love. That’s my 2 yen.”"
