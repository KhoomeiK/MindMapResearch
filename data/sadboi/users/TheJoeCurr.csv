Christian,f0g31nq,t1_f0fzv9z,1568592932.0,"Well, it's not necessarily false, it's not necessarily true either, it's just not science. Many of the things religion poses are not experimentally verifiable. Doesn't mean or suggest you can't believe them. Actually you could study the effect Christian belief has on a person's well being, that would be science. The belief in God, if you can think of some way of testing this hypothesis, so that the belief can be disproven, go for it. If you want to say get a bunch of Christians together and pray for it to snow in the summer months on a selected date, if it doesn't snow, it would indicate there's a limitation to the power of prayer, or that it works in ways not to be tested, perhaps there wasn't enough people praying. For something to be science, a hypothesis or belief has to be falsifiable in some way. If a belief is falsifiable, and experiment after experiment fails to falsify the hypothesis we adopt it. Christians have yet to make a compelling demonstration of faith, and the Bible forbids testing of God. Like how Harold Camping predicted the end of the world, and it didn't happen, one could argue there is no God, and Christians would argue he was punished for claiming to know the time and date, punished for testing God."

If a woman compliments another woman by how symmetrical her face is, it's perverse, If I were that woman, I'd feel objectified. I'd feel like the woman is maybe envious and has some kind of superficial and perverse value system. If a brown eyed woman says I love your blue eyes, I wish I had blue eyes.

CasualConversation,eyxz5uv,t1_eyxyhse,1567566438.0,"I was at a Quaker church in the area, I enjoy the company of the Quakers there, and this one man talked about a Quaker hero of his who was against slavery. The man had several friends who were slavers and he would ask them uncomfortable questions. Like ""that slave girl you have there she's about 14, how would you feel if that were your daughter?"" His friends grew to distance himself from him. I felt like that was a wonderful thing he did, but it came at expense to himself, and I was wondering if there was a way to enact change like that, that does not come at personal expense that is just as or more effective, like raising money and buying all the slaves freedom, thereby freeing slaves - which the man may not have accomplished and retained friendships."

Like how Abraham Lincoln, when he wanted to say something mean and critical of someone, would write a letter, and he would wait one day, read it over, and send the letter... to himself. Sometimes when the letter came back, I think he'd read it and feel foolish."

How disappointed can you be with someone and continue a relationship? Does it feel like he's testing that? Personally it's a test I wouldn't want to take.

relationship_advice,eyxck2r,t3_cz77ka,1567549965.0,"This is so relate-able for me. People want you to have children, but after experiencing a love like that, it seems perverse to move on. It's touching, you're mother wants you to experience raising children, and it sounds like you are open to finding to new love, you just have doubts that after experiencing a wonderful husband, you will ever have that again. Do you marry and have kids for the sake of procreation? It seems bizarre to do so. I feel like you can conjure the people you love, regardless of how they've left you. What would my loved one say? You can have that kind of spiritual company. On the other hand, if you choose to do that too much, become reclusive, you might end up in an institution. I think your mother is right, as much as you love your husband, you're gonna love your future children more, and to forgo that as a testament of love to your past husband, would I think, I believe your mother thinks, that would be a mistake."
relationship_advice,eyxb59h,t3_cz6ozc,1567548984.0,"It's important to your fiance, that their children know about their real mother, and don't forget about her. It seems he still loves her. I have a deep sense in my intuition that having them call you mother is a good thing for the whole family. I think the issue is with your fiance. You might remind the little ones that you are not their biological mother but you are still their mommy and you'll care for them and love them just as their mother would have."
