Deppression,fpb4pcq,t3_gcanmn,1588462055.0,Have you considered professional help?
intrusivethoughts,fp7pn3u,t1_fp7pg55,1588375211.0,Tysm
intrusivethoughts,fp7orzm,t1_fp7ns9v,1588374719.0,Thankyou. It's just I've seen contrasting advice like some sites say to observe thoughts and have no reaction to them. And others say to argue with them and build a case as to why they're false. The issue with the first option is that I can't just desensitize myself to things that are really horrific. And with the second option it's just my mind creates so much doubt when there shouldn't be any and I manage to convince myself that I'm a terrible person with little to no logical evidence. I'm sorry for rambling I know you didn't ask but yeah I think I'm gonna seek professional help because I don't wanna keep living if it's like this.
teenagers,fn0xab8,t1_fn0w5ki,1586550549.0,Oh cool man I haven't ate edibles before lmk how it goes. Also it depends on who you are and what strain you have but sometimes weed can cause anxiety itself so be careful. If you're in a safe environment with chill people then you'll be fine. My biggest mistake was my first time smoking I got it from this dodgy guy I barely knew and smoked it with one friend who was also a first timer and we ended up convincing ourselves that the guy was gonna kill us lmao + we were in public where weed is illegal so that didn't help. Anyway yh don't be like me lolol
teenagers,fn0vztz,t3_fwdff5,1586549828.0,"If you're in a safe environment and it's in moderation then you're alright imo. It's recommended to wait until you're older though because of concerns about brain development. If you are going to smoke up then make sure you don't use it to treat negative emotions because it can lead to dependence or sometimes even issues with paranoia/schizophrenia. Also get whatever shit you need to do done before you smoke so you don't become the stereotypical lazy stoner. Only do it when you're comfortable and happy hanging with friends so you can chill and have a laugh, that's the best way always"

Deppression,fhgs13s,t3_f30olg,1581576798.0,"Good friends should try and show an interest if you're interested in a topic but there's always a chance you talk too much about it by accident. It sounds obvious but maybe just focus on their body language while you're talking. Make sure they have a turn to speak too and then you are all good. If you want to test whether someone is listening just say something outlandish in the middle of your sentence, or ask a weird question. If it gets real bad maybe consider finding new friends that share your interests?"

im14andthisisdeep,ewpr2px,t1_ewp8ujp,1565647358.0,What puts us so above them?
im14andthisisdeep,ewo5ady,t1_ewmt7fp,1565606443.0,"I understand where you're coming from, but it's probably easier than you may think nowadays. And even if you don't want to go fully vegan it still helps alot to go vegetarian, pescatarian or just to lower your red meat consumption. And whilst ethical treatment at slaughterhouses is important, the animals are still being killed. If someone treats a person really well before they kill them, it does not make their murder any more acceptable. Imo same goes for killing animals."
im14andthisisdeep,ewo50zl,t1_ewmsitq,1565606099.0,"You do realise that many lands are poor in nutrients because of livestock farming? It leads to land degradation amongst a plethora of other environmental issues. 

I agree it would be extremely difficult for the entire world to abandon all meat products, but it is all about supply and demand. Some change is better than no change. As more people stop eating meat, less meat needs to be produced and so the environmental impacts of meat will lessen and less animals will need to be killed. 

And again, even if you think plants feel emotions like we and other animals do, which I highly doubt, eating meat still means more plants are killed. More plants are needed to feed the livestock. Also pigs have legit been shown to be smarter than two year old children and dogs. Are you really gonna say you have the same amount of compassion for a plant's life than a pig's? 

The rest of your argument all comes down to convenience really. I'm not going to tell you that you must become a vegan because I know you don't want to. But even slightly restricting your red meat consumption can help greatly."
im14andthisisdeep,ewo45yk,t1_ewn1hng,1565604939.0,"My life is built on privilege? I don't cause death because I don't have to. People that cause death even though they don't have to sounds much more privelleged. Yes, if you're in the position where you have to eat meat for some reason then how can I criticise you for doing so? But in reality, many people do not have to.

Plus most people that eat meat in the Western world are very hypocritical when it comes to this. They wouldn't hunt and kill an animal themselves because they would feel bad for it. They also tend to feel bad for the animal when watching slaughterhouse videos. Yet they choose to continue eating meat because it is so easy for them to buy it and turn a blind eye to the death it took to make it."
im14andthisisdeep,ewo3sq4,t1_ewnaj4b,1565604413.0,"Right but it's sort of common sense that to produce meat, more resources are needed because you have to grow the animal first. And even if that wasn't true it is still the case that animals feel sadness in a much closer way to humans than plants do."
im14andthisisdeep,ewmpkwr,t1_ewmoyu6,1565557373.0,"They're in the wild they eat what they can find to ensure survival. We have so much choice. And we are not driven by instincts to hunt and kill. We have the capacity for empathy and compassion. The capacity to realise unnecessary pain is not just. I know this is the unpopular opinion and people don't like to be criticised for their lifestyle choices, but looking at the impacts of our actions is important."

im14andthisisdeep,ewmn075,t1_ewmm8je,1565555580.0,"Mate some people are cannibals and they think human meat is tasty so something tasting good doesn't mean its morally right to eat it. And there's not rlly anything wrong with our ancestors eating meat because back then it was more of a necessity. Today animals are being killed even though it is not needed anymore. We have so many other options. They are dying and in pain for our pleasure/convenience only. And unlike these mammoths you speak of, these factory farmed animals usually don't even get to experience any joy, life or freedom beforehand."
im14andthisisdeep,ewmmcjd,t1_ewmk67u,1565555131.0,Nah I mean I understand the hypocrisy it is trying to portray but it's still a bit cringey.
AskReddit,ewmm0ad,t3_cotsqp,1565554895.0,Onision. I was younger then so more easily manipulated to think he was right in all situations. I realise now that he's not a gr8 person lol
im14andthisisdeep,ewmluzs,t1_ewmkcyd,1565554791.0,"Funny, but fr it's not comparable to the animals being killed. They can experience pain and sadness also. I just don't see the need to inflict this on them when it is unnecessary."
im14andthisisdeep,ewml7df,t1_ewmiknr,1565554331.0,Nah but that's not the point. Meat production still requires more water than vegetables/fruits/starchy roots.
im14andthisisdeep,ewmgwq1,t1_ewmbht0,1565551371.0,You have a reason to not like Hitler but what did the animals do to you lol
im14andthisisdeep,ewmgn56,t1_ewliei7,1565551190.0,"Large quantities of plants/water are needed to produce meat itself. Crops/water needed for the livestock to grow. 

A quick Google search says: ""toÂ produceÂ 1kg ofÂ meatÂ requires between 5,000 and 20,000Â litres of waterÂ whereas toproduceÂ 1kg of wheat requires between 500 and 4,000Â litres of water""

Our bodies require plants and water to survive however we do not need meat to survive.  In fact there are studies that highlight the health benefits of not eating meat. 

Plus plants and water don't have feelings lol"
