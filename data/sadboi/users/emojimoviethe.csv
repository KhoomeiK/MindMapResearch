The woman gets to sit back and break men's hearts until she decides on one she likes and never the other way around. 

It will always be easier for girls because feminism has yet to eliminate the myth that women should always be perceived for their physical beauty while men are around to provide for others, either with their strength or intelligence. And physical attraction is what draws people in. As long as the woman looks not horrible, she doesn't have to do anything to have the men come up to her. Makeup is also a huge factor.
