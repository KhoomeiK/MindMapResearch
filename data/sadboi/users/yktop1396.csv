socialwork,ezv2ktx,t3_d2hxev,1568165567.0,"Ask for more shadowing opportunities, have a list ofnresources at the ready when you take calls, process calls after the fact with co-workers, validate clients feelings and offer them to speak with a coworker if possible, take their number and gather information and return their call if possible.  Be honest about what you know and dont know, its worse to give false or incorrect info then admitting you dont know and finding the correct information.  These are things that helped me but it also is a ""baptism by fire"" and just getting calls under your belt that truly helps."

TwoXChromosomes,et511vz,t3_ca15gx,1562461793.0,"It honestly sounds possessive and emotionally manipulative of him.  Also, not respectful of your boundaries to end the relationship.  I would get out and detach if you can.  Be clear and direct and follow through on your wishes to end the relationship.  Lean on your supports to help you maintain your boundaries from him.  Best of luck!  Hope it turns out well."
