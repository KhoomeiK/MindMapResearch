GreenBay,fozjbv5,t3_gab727,1588191625.0,"You can get outside for sure! I think both Baird's and Fonferek are open and some state natural areas have just reopened so some light camping may be okay! Just make sure when you pass by people you give them a wide berth. 

The caveat here is, you shouldn't be going out or doing anything with anyone you don't currently cohabitate with, even if you are staying 6 feet apart. It's my understanding that the 6 feet apart rule is meant to be applied for situations where you MUST be around other people, i.e. grocery store trips. It's not a guideline for getting together with friends or family.

I've been seeing a lot of ""6-feet apart hangs"" that honestly shouldn't be happening. Everyone really should *only* be interacting with those in their immediate household and that's it. I get that it really sucks. I miss my friends real bad, too. But I just am trying to remember that every time someone tries to find a loophole or sort of skirt the rules during this is a slap in the face to a front line worker. (Not saying that's you, OP. I know you're not trying to find a loophole and are just asking an honest question.)

[I found this article to be a helpful (albeit blunt) explainer.](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/4agza3/answer-to-all-social-distancing-loophole-questions-is-no?fbclid=IwAR2w9KjEtk_SJfEskHawPKIHE3-eZwwMSLAllf5yiRhMpHrda8krIaYUl1g)

And I don‚Äôt believe not one person in that class of 31 didn‚Äôt know. And then to joke about it on Facebook afterwards?

TheAdventureZone,fdqzyti,t1_fdq7w0a,1578677671.0,"Yeah, that whole conversation between Leon and Fitz was frustrating. Griffin's a pretty experienced DM and storyteller at this point though, so I kept wondering why he wasn't helping Travis along a little bit? I kept waiting for Fitz to be like ""What did you see/hear, Leon?"" to try and move the conversation out of this ambiguous ""school bad maybe ?????"" zone. Then at least he would have something concrete to share with the other players and perhaps something to actually investigate. 

Travis is not doing a great job. I hope he's going to get better! But I also think Justin and Griffin could be trying to help him with that more. Justin seems already super over it. Griffin seems enthusiastic about playing, but like he doesn't want to step on Travis' toes at all even though he could really help steer him in the right direction.

Clint's great. He's actually getting good at D&D, lol."

Anxiety,fcxjnmc,t3_ejgk6q,1578064574.0,"Just remember that news media profits on our fear. Right now propaganda and sensationalized headlines are going to be flying everywhere. Find reliable news sources. Check facts. Don‚Äôt let yourself be swallowed by the nihilistic ‚Äúwe‚Äôre gonna die‚Äù coping reaction of many people on social media. We should be worried about what‚Äôs to come, but right now you are safe.

Anxiety can really really fuck with you. Let these scary thoughts pass through your mind, say hello to them, and then let them continue to pass right on by. They are there but they don‚Äôt have to mean anything right now. Sometimes I find just acknowledging my anxious thoughts in a neutral way helps. Sort of saying ‚ÄúI see you. I know you exist. And that‚Äôs as much power has I‚Äôm giving you right now.‚Äù

Good luck! I know these feel like scary times. I‚Äôve been anxious too. I hope this could help even a little bit."
