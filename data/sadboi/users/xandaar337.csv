While I'm still bitter that it's not the exact same ring, I actually like this one MUCH better.

So personally I'm an atheist, always have been. My family knows and it's a non issue I guess. So I may not fully get that part. But there are gay friendly churches out there. Just call around and ask. If they stutter, they aren't. Not to be rude but as an outsider, I find religious folks will lie to spare your feelings, but that makes it confusing.

As far as family goes, I had a rough time of it growing up. Over time I've let them know they can either accept me being gay and treat me right, or they can fuck right off. It's about a 50/50 split lol. But I don't go anywhere I'm not wanted.  

Every situation is different. Do what you feel is best, but don't allow others to mistreat you! If your feelings are hurt by people's words regularly, tell them! Remind them that saying hurtful things is not setting a good example for christian-like behavior (or other religion of course)."
AmItheAsshole,fnx744h,t3_g49inc,1587332785.0,"I read your original post and this update and it's reminiscent of a younger me to an extent. My parents had a rough time deciding on who was ""right"" after divorcing. Each had their own set of issues.

I stayed with my mother during the summers in high school and as an adult I can tell you it has substantially affected my mental and physical health two decades later.  She was so controlling about weight and diet I eventually said ""fuck it"" and quit eating. I was 150lbs at 6ft tall, male.  My sister's periods and weight were marked on the family calendar and she's still overweight now. She would get punished regularly for hiding poptarts and other junk food in her car. 

I've gone no contact with my mother and low contact with my sister.  My mother's control, lies and manipulation have fucked us for life, including our relationship with food.

Often, eating disorders are indicative of a larger problem. Watch ""my 600 lb life"" and see how many of them come from fucked up homes. It's not coincidence.

I'm glad you want to help her. That's great. Pressuring her about her weight directly may not be the ticket. There's been lots of times I've faked interest or an opinion to take the heat off me. That's exactly what this story sounds like to me."
