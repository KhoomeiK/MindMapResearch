Flavcity is great if you are looking to learn how to eat clean and mostly Keto. What are the best/healthiest things to buy at Costco? Trader Joe's?  Aldi? ..and more..

Epic Gardening and Urban Gardening are great if you're a noob trying to garden for the first time like me, growing your own food, and beginners tips. 

Patricia Bright! Best make-up and blog channel. I love how she randomly starts singing all the time like me, and she's such a strong independent woman that I look up to.
 
And shout out to one of my OG favs on YouTube:

Gabriel Traveler- awesome guy who's spent his life traveling around the world and takes you with him. He does everything himself, shows you where to stay and visit and gives tips on traveling the world on a budget and open mind. No added production bs, just a super humble nice guy trying to encourage everyone to travel anywhere."

I use to also really enjoy watching the view, but ever since the Bernie bashing it's getting harder and harder to watch. I wonder if this all started on the downhill slope when Abby left? She seems so rational now in hindsight and probably left as soon as she could to not be a part of this nonsense that is this show now. I believe that they are misleading voters on purpose to protect their bank accounts. They are so out of touch with what normal people have to deal with, especially whoppi lately. Why is it so hard/scary to think we could actually change the way our government works to work better for the people? Is it that they don't believe the younger generations can actually get it done? 

I have never voted before, I absolutely will now. And I know several people personally that are in the same position and will absolutely turn out for Bernie as well."

Your comment really helps me because I'm in a very similar situation with my mom who just posted a couple of weeks ago, and just days before her birthday. I keep trying to remind myself that I've been trying for years to help her with the alcoholism, and I pray that just because I was hard on her towards the end, I was only trying to help because I cared and loved her so much. 
Not the last time but the second to last time I saw her she was wasted and cursing me out, saying the worst things just to make me hurt like she does. But I didn't get mad, I knew that wasn't her it was the alcohol. I stopped calling, and so did she. Thankfully I saw her at Xmas but I couldn't tell how sick she was. I didn't call after Xmas either.

Getting mad that ppl can get away with whatever terrible shit they want. Day dreaming about getting revenge, but never would due to bad karma.
