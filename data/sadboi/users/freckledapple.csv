The Pellegrino - so delicious and light.

The Stay Cay - sooo good. But yes dangerous, I had 1 and felt tipsy so I had another. If you want something lighter you can do a little less campari & replace champagne with soda water - still really tasty.

Red Hot Rita - this is delicious. Highly recommend infusing your tequila overnight to get it spicy if you like spice! I tweeted Ariana for a sub for the red hot riplets since I‚Äôm in Canada: rim with tajin & add tobasco.

Classic margarita - can‚Äôt go wrong with a classic, I think I added a bit more lime.

Bloody Caesar - this version didn‚Äôt vary much from my own recipe  that I use - it‚Äôs great but I love adding spicy pickle juice of some sort too.

Edit: PS happy cocktail-ing!"

SkincareAddiction,etbrva0,t3_cavqvc,1562658912.0,"Hey guys,

After spending hours reading through threads I think I‚Äôve narrowed down my potential additions to my routine and was hoping for some feedback, to confirm I‚Äôm understanding things correctly.

Me: Fair skin, combination, Fitzpatrick 2, late 20s. Canada.

Goal: to incorporate some more advanced anti aging treatments to get rid of very fine lines on my forehead (optimize moisture), prevent crows feet, and to shrink some pores/blackheads on my nose/cheeks.

Current routine: Vichy foaming cleanser, garnier micellar water, neotrogena Helioplex spf 30, or Vichy aqualia thermal light moisturizer. (Too oily with both) Been using Vichy for years.

Potential update:
Add The Ordinary glycolic acid 5% toner - every second day?
Add The ordinary granactive retinol 2% - daily? (Or 1% in squalane - is there much diff?)
Add the ordinary caffeine solution 5% as needed for eyes

Am I missing a BHA? I feel like it might be too intense to add all 3 going from 0... 

Thank you for reading if you got this far!"

It was a great way to see some spots around the city and knock things off the list. The subway was also very easy to use, I mostly used google maps and it told me everything I needed to know and where to get on etc. 

Hopefully that helps! I‚Äôm happy to answer more questions if you have any."
