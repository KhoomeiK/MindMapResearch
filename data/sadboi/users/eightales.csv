SkincareAddiction,fqz21ms,t3_gl8woh,1589758511.0,"**Is it possible to have dry skin that gets oily with alcohol?**   
I understand alcohols can overly-strip the skin, and therefore actually lead to more oil production, but on super dry skin?  


A few years ago, before I had a skin-care routine, I didn't really get acne and pimples but my skin was super dry, tight, flaky and sometimes even scaly, and I actually had a patch of seborrheic dermatitis that spread over my face due to the dryness. Doctor told me to use aveeno moisturizers (likely because they are advertised as best for dermatitis) and that cleared it up and I've been using it ever since.

But now my skin is more oily, and I get much more acne (I live in the same place, with the same climate as it was in 2018, when I switched to the moisturizer). I didnt piece this together for many years, that the moisturizer is likely causing it (switching cleansers, sunscreens, etc. never helped) and I suspect its due to the fact that it has multiple types of alcohol in it (I have the Aveeno Cooling Action Relief moisturizer, i think thats its name). I'm now on the hunt for a moisturizer with ZERO alcohol, not even cetyl, because I've tried a moisturizer before which slightly reduced the oiliness, that contained cetyl, but the oiliness was still kinda there and the only product that seemed link to this was the cetyl alcohol.

**Can someone recommend me a moisturizer for dry skin that has 0% alcohol, including no cetyl/its familiar?**"

skin,fqwkfyn,t1_fqwjrqu,1589707717.0,"What products did you try? A lot of products out there are pretty bad, but there are definitely some gems. Simple, short, effective ingredient list can make a world of difference compared to products advertising about their fancy additives that may just make things worth for most people, you know? I‚Äôm glad you have any skincare at all though, a lot of people don‚Äôt.

I‚Äôm really sorry it‚Äôs affecting your confidence, I really hope you can find something that works to help! Remember, your skin doesn‚Äôt determine you- you‚Äôre so much more than how you look in the outside, if anyone judges you based on your skin, it‚Äôs their loss.

Definitely invest in a super gentle cleanser meant for dry skin, and even maybe a chemical exfoliant (stay away from scrubs, tools and brushes) to help with some of the dead skin that will likely be building up on your face, but only get the exfoliant if your skin isn‚Äôt too sensitive, as obviously I don‚Äôt know your skin as well as you or a dermatologist or doctor will.

Using just a moisturiser can be not so good because water doesn‚Äôt really cleanse it out of your pores (and using a soap or 3 in 1 will just irritate the skin and still not even go into the pores as much as would be preferable) but a gentle cleanser will. If it‚Äôs just hanging around in your pores, building up more and more, it won‚Äôt be too great for your skin.

Aveeno has some moisturisers meant specifically for dermatitis (mostly eczema but they help with other dermatitis too) which work really well! Of course, be careful and check the ingredients list, because even good brands have their downfalls, but it‚Äôs worth checking out since they‚Äôll have some extra ingredients (like the oatmeal I mentioned earlier) that will aid in not just moisturising the skin, but really hydrating it as well. 

Definitely look for products that draw moisture into your skin from your environment (humectants) since you won‚Äôt be getting much without them in a dry climate (which I‚Äôm assuming you live in).

Glad to help, by the way! I love to info-dump."
skin,fqwjece,t1_fqwi61u,1589706613.0,"I think if it didn‚Äôt work you should of gone to a dermatologist and asked what they think it is and ask for recommendations in terms of skincare and possible medications. Ketoderm is often used for seborrheic dermatitis which is likely why she prescribed it (though as the other user said it is commonly used for fungal infections) but not all medications work for certain people even if aimed at the right problem. 
Could definitely be a problem with the climate, but this is also extreme and likely not just from that alone. Do you use anything else? A simple effective routine should have a cleanser, moisturiser and sunscreen with NO fragrance/parfum, essential or unneeded oils, added colouring, or stripping alcohols. I recommend using Incidecoder.com to check the ingredients of any products you buy to ensure they‚Äôre not just terrible. Also aim for products meant for dry skin (or combined skin if the areas that aren‚Äôt flaky/dry are oily? But I‚Äôm assuming that‚Äôs not the case). A moisturiser with oatmeal in it will help! It‚Äôs good for dermatitis, though more so eczema, it can help other types too. 

Are you sure you don‚Äôt use anything else? No bar soap on the face or something? Cause that‚Äôs bad.  I believe cetaphil is a good brand but cerave is much better from a formulation perspective. Try to avoid using hot water on your face of course, just cold or slightly warm will be better since flaky, dry, possibly damaged skin will be more sensitive!"

It‚Äôs just this alongside the fact that I heard those voices a few months earlier and that when I did experience dissociation it was nothing like this (not to mention I didn‚Äôt feel really dissociated when this was happening and I never have depersonalisation without derealization) I know what it feels like to feel like I‚Äôm not the one controlling my body while controlling it, but to actually still know that I am the one controlling, I couldn‚Äôt predict my movements and it felt much more different. Thanks I guess"
