bipolar,flfugk7,t3_focyah,1585118236.0,"I'm kind of used to staying at home. Ever since I dropped out due to several attempts (around 5 months ago) I barely go out of the comfort of my home. I only go out to do the groceries with my parents on weekends, but that's because I grew up doing that. Other than that, I stay at home and try studying a bit myself, if I'm inbthe mood to do so."

bipolar,f1z3inf,t3_db84yo,1569832712.0,"I was diagnosed at 16. I was unaware that I had the disorder beforehand. I personally think that documenting her moods would come in handy should you decide to meet a psych. If she's talking about suicide seriously, it might be best if you could have her assessed immediately, because apparently, we don't want that to happen. There's just a high chance that she got the disorder since both parents had it, and this could be a manifestation of it.

Here's something I read online from https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/bipolar-disorder/expert-answers/bipolar-disorder-in-children/faq-20058227

It says ""...it's normal to feel down, irritable, angry, hyperactive or rebellious at times. However, if your child's symptoms are severe, ongoing or causing significant problems, it may be more than just a phase."""

OCD,eqn1dra,t3_bywws1,1560170404.0,"I don't know if this would help but tbh, I think the same can be said for me... when I was diagnosed, my thoughts revolved around death (and my loved ones were involved). Then came a time when I had thoughts about raping the 7 year old sister of my friend. Now, my obsessions revolve around the idea that I was misdiagnosed, and that I'm actually bipolar instead of unipolar. My thoughts are, in the words of psychiatrist, evolving. However, my compulsions were and are in the form of reassurance seeking... that's my observation. I can't say much since my diagnosis is considerably new, and I'm probably still under observation right now, nevertheless, I hope this answered your question..."
OCD,eqmyg35,t1_eqbubxw,1560169327.0,"It's just that I don't want to be left alone since it's when I'm alone that I tend to think too much. Recently, she started to interact with me less, citing that she had a ton of chores and that she wanted to have some time for herself too, something I can understand. However, my fried brain tells me that it's a betrayal (though part of me tells me that it's not), and that it's a sign that she doesn't care for me anymore. I told her about how I had felt, which might've offended her. I don't really know.. and now I'm stuck regretting telling her about it. I'm ashamed of how my mind has been wired to think, maybe this is where the suicidal thoughts spring out of... btw thanks for letting me share the bs I did... I just feel stupid for being like this."
