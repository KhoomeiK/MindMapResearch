I wanna lose weight because I love myself. I want some tips in case I’m not doing things correctly or if there’s more strategies to safely lose weight I’d love to hear about. Thank you again 💕💕💕"

amiugly,fackohh,t3_e88mr6,1575941435.0," No, you’re not ugly at all. I think you look pretty decent. Something you should work on is your confidence; it’s somehow expressed through your posture. Beautiful eyes. The corners of your mouth tend to go down, so try smiling more."

lonely,f6x242i,t3_dtd2k0,1573240194.0,"It’s strange that I have had so many boyfriends before but I feel you so much. I’ve never been attracted to guys much, physically, emotionally, romantically or physically. But because of my cultural background, I would feel sinful if I’m with a girl, so I blindly go through guys after guys hoping to find someone that I can be attracted to. What worse than being single is being in relationships in which you feel lonely. But being single sucks so much, because while everyone around you is happy with their bf’s or gf’s, you’re just there alone, with nobody. You feel left out and hated because there’s not even one person that wants to be with you. But it’s better to be single than to force yourself into a relationship. Relationships don’t feel that great if you’re not with the right person, because you’ll be trapped. THERE’S NOTHING WRONG WITH BEING SINGLE. Eventually, you will find the right one."

lonely,f6x0pth,t3_dt9kw9,1573239270.0,"Birthdays don’t need to be parties or huge celebrations. To me it’s as simple as someone saying ‘happy birthday’ and that should be enough, because then I know that someone cares for me. It feels good when someone appreciates your existence, because we all come to this world for a reason. I hope you overcome all the hardships in your life; you’re lost now but I BELIEVE in you, that one day you will find a way out. I know you’re exhausted, but you’re fighting so strong and I admire you! Lastly and most importantly, HAPPY BIRTHDAY! Have a nice one because all of us truly care for you <3"
iamatotalpieceofshit,ewr20ef,t3_cpk6lo,1565690797.0,"In my country, Vietnam, there’s this child-die-in-a-school-bus case that has really gotten people insanely raging. This was a first-grade kid who just went on his second day of elementary school. He was left inside of a 16-seat school bus. His teachers, the nanny (who were assigned to picking up and checking attendance for all the kids going by school buses) and the driver all noticed that he was missing, but none of them reported to the office or called his parents (they said it was the school rule that aside from the office, the teachers were forbidden to call the parents directly 🙄). Later on, the driver drove the bus from the parking lot to the front of the school, but somehow didn’t see the child laying on the floor of the bus. Then his friends opened the door to get on the bus, and they all screamed in great fear. His shirt appeared to have been changed, although most of first-graders in Vietnam don’t know how to change shirts, especially when in a stage of panicking, which makes the case even more shady and suspicious. He’s also said to have bruises on his body (which was normal considering he was a very active kid); unfortunately, autopsies in Vietnam are pretty lousy. I feel so bad for him, it’s must have been very frightening for him to die slowly, in a school bus (if that was the case), without his parents hearing his scream for help ;-;"
