Borderline,fl4utfg,t3_fmkjy7,1584821988.0,I’m currently on the anti-psychotic “Abilify” and it helps tremendously with quieting the paranoid thoughts and helps me not to split and be so black and white.

Fabric used was fat cotton quarters and fleece dollar store blankets. I saw these hammocks on Etsy but couldn’t afford them so decided to try myself! I am a mega amateur which is why the seams aren’t perfect and are a bit wonky. 

Essentially you hang these in your pet rat’s cage and they sleep on the fleece part (cotton part is decorative/themed). 

I found a website ages ago (can’t find it now) that had rudimentary instructions on making rat accessories (sew square, turn inside out, top stitch, etc) but the hanging loops I had to figure out myself."

Makeup is self expression and many people wear makeup with the intention of it NOT looking natural and there is nothing wrong with that. I love the doll look, like spookylittlepeach on Instagram. I know they’re fake. People ask “are those real” and I go “nope I glued them on!” Same as when I glue glitter to my face, or overline my lips, or any of the other gaudy things I love doing. I feel cute, and if others don’t feel cute doing those things that’s totally fine. But all the girls on here being like “it looks terrible on other people”... why do you care?"
