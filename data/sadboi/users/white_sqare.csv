I'm not even claiming what you say has no descriptive value whatsoever.

Again, you cannot expect to detract me from my opinions without even trying to deconstruct the actual kind of fantasies I engage or have engaged in.

I just have trouble buying into any one-sided partial explanation because of my particular set of experiences (I'll tell you more once I'm less tired) and the things I have witnessed online. I do think there is such a thing as an intrinsic predisposition to masochism (in a very broad sense) that predates any particular trauma and that any early traumatic is not somehow, the exclusive prototype on which later sexual experiences are based on.  
In fact I suspect this predisposition is part of some larger sexual system(s?) that revolves around self and context and is not a bug but a feature of human sexuality.
How this actually latch onto experience, the level of abstraction in which one can best describe it.. are all very hard questions. 


I have a lot of masochistic tendencies myself, but I'm not sure humiliation is the best way of getting at them. In fact gritty and crude violence or humiliation are a turn off for me. I went through a phase growing up when I leaned towards masochism as an explanation of my sexuality (and try to use this to manipulate the subject of the fantasies, you know, to make them more cis-het normative and all that).

Blanchardianism,feg3lzi,t1_fe6r7oi,1579075416.0,"Not so fast. First of all, I actually don't doubt that some people out there have exam fetishes.

Second, what you are talking about sounds more like a purely physiological reaction to high levels of stress than an ""exam fetish"". Can that sort of reaction lead to some sort of long-lasting sexual imprint. Again, I don't categorically exclude the possibility such a thing might happen, I've heard or read stories myself.
 
However: 

- that is not what wxhluyp talks about, since he describes the phenomenon he has in mind as some sort of psychological coping mechanism; he has also emphasized in the past he is working with a looser notion of trauma that does not require the presence of a particularly ""very traumatic event"" (the reason being that for plenty, even most of the MEF crowd such an event is hard to find) 
- I have yet to see a community of people whose sexual life revolves around symbolic (the symbolic part is important) reenactment of childhood examination (or dentist) situations of a similar size and nature as the MEF one; why the difference? there are things to explain

My point is not that trauma has no role to play in all this, but to reject the idea that sexual masochism is something purely derivative from trauma / distress."
Blanchardianism,fd9xp2j,t1_fd93387,1578239258.0," Is the existence of a coping mechanism like the one you describe that plausible? How does the mechanism explain the actual frequency of different masochistic fetishes (in your larger sense)?  Shouldn't there be way more people with masochistic examination fetishes? Dentist fetishes? 

>I think how you represent or look at something, can be very different from the symbolic structure which makes you feel a certain way.

The fact that you can actually manipulate what symbolic structure a certain narrative or idea activates by tinkering with the way it is presented tells you something about the way content is processed sexually by the brain. Its degree of malleability points out to it being a self-standing sexual principle that exists on its own and it's not merely a proxy for something as specific as emasculation, let alone a specific trauma  (unless you enter some sort of freudian fugue state in which everything is a disguised presentation of a disguised presentation of a disguised presentation of something hyper-concrete). The mind is really more jungian than freudian. It is an abstraction machine.  Dunno, maybe I just happen to be so very multiply traumatized.

>I say that my understanding, intimately grasps the vast bulk and communities of the fetishists in question. It is arrogant, but almost certainly, there is no one who understands this fetish better than I do. The next closest thing you have is the AGP establishment and ""ETLE"".

I think it is safe to say that nobody on the planet right now has the slightest idea of how these things really work. Should we go back again at listing the failures of the ETLE (without getting into aap)?:

- agp in exclusively androphilic males  (everybody was just meta until they weren't)

- lack of explanation of the caterogorical gap between the object and the ""inverted object"" (type error) so that the deal doesn't seem to be about looking for the same thing in a different place, but instead goes up one notch in terms of abstraction  

- meta-agp (+interpersonal agp) lack reasonable alloerotic correlates; as far as I know nobody did ever get a boner upon hearing reading that this or that actress was ""the most desired woman of her time""; the example might be a bit unfair, but you get the point

- particular preferences don't seem to carry well form the alloerotic context to the autoerotic one

- ETLE hypothesis fails for other group(s) traditionally thought of as a paradigmatic example of ETLE 

- inability to operationally distinguish agp in a categorical way from similar phenomena in cis women, including heterosexual cis women, except by using what could be interpreted as direct appeals to alloerotic attraction

- lack of explanation of earlier transformation fantasies of a different nature; apparently we are supposed to believe a full sexual orientation (innate or almost innate according to blanchard) can simply evaporate just like that somewhere in the middle of puberty

- romantic agp (no comment)

>

I do think people who identify with ETLE do it for reasons that have to do with the fine grain of their particular experiences and that the term is actually getting at something.  Alloerotic attraction might as well play a role in the (their?) story (although imo  this role is not exclusive and the story is not about ""the erroneous location of targets""). Unfortunately, we rarely much of that lived experience."
Blanchardianism,fd9ln78,t1_fd99ae0,1578235020.0,">the more attached they are, the more they are less inclined to like the idea that their object of love is sexual

The population of people who are aroused by balloons is infinitesimally smaller than any of the ones discussed here. Saying that something is sexual and saying that something is perverse are entirely two different things. Denying one and denying the other are not equivalent. (Personally, I don't have any trouble thinking of the love of speedboats can involve feelings that re pure in some sense, even if I don't partake in it.) Do all kinksters idealize their kinks? I don't get this impression; many people online with exclusive fetishes for stuff express themselves about them in a very detached way. More evidence is needed. 

There is a huge different between a sexual trigger and sexual attraction, between attachment and attraction and between all sorts of types of attachment. ""Attachment"" is such a loose word; you could describe any mental phenomenon as some form of aversion or attachment; it barely says anything."
Blanchardianism,fd8hyzt,t1_fctq3nj,1578218537.0,"What do you mean by a form of sexual desire? Getting a sexual kick out of something and something making you euphoric are two different feelings which are clearly distinct even to a child and here don't necessarily co-occur. The memory I was talking about goes back to a time in which none of my protosexual fantasies had involved feminization whatsoever. I had had a dream in which I was dressed as a girl and somebody saw me (at 6 or so), but it wasn't arousing -didn't feel funny like the others- nor it was particularly emotionally salient. So it seems very unlikely that the propensity to adopt the female point of view in romantic and later sexual situations was a byproduct of an emasculation fetish. 
(By the way, I am under the impression this what for blanchardians these days would be an instance of ""real agp"".  ) 
If anything it was precisely this kind of new 'identity threat' a couple of years before puberty led to having an emasculation fetish later on (if at all).

>Interestingly, whatever the psychological phenomena, it almost always tends to be more powerful when an element of self identity happens to become related to it.

Mmm.. I don't think I agree, but could you maybe elaborate a bit?"
Blanchardianism,fd8e57e,t1_fd4qjix,1578217362.0,"Well, then please explain us ""really is"" and why does this have an entity of its own instead of being just a particular manifestation of something more abstract/general. One could make the claim that masochistic themes are just a particular way of feeling vulnerable and at the same time safe in the presence of some intense external attention (or something of this flavour), which is what the sexual drive was actually ""looking for"" when it latched to masochistic themes. 

Not everything that's distressing has the same potential to become erotic. There are way less people with a fetish for taking exams than MEFs. I think it is reasonable to assume that the imprinting is informed by some sort of pre-existing template(s). What do those templates look like? What """"""language"""""" are they written on?"
Blanchardianism,fd83asb,t1_fd4pjxn,1578213457.0,"> The logic of sexuality is the connection of symbolism with arousal via imprinting. By definition, for something to be arousing at all, means that it is some way symbolically resonates with what has been imprinted. 

Well, there is some imprinting going on, but what is actually the content of this imprinting, at what level of abstraction does it inhabit? What are the preconditions for a content to be subject to imprinting. These questions are not obvious at all. And you think of this symbolic resonance as something that happens entirely independently from someone's conscious process. This is not my personal experience. When a narrative element in a fantasy gets to be perceived in a different light - as a result of life experience or one's active conscious effort during the act of fantasizing - how sexual it is can change, sometimes dramatically. These days I find the idea of wearing a skirt way less erotic than I found the idea of growing a beard when I was 12. 


>I think that most imprints that guide ""normal"" sexual desires for humans and sex with humans, has mostly come to be transferred genetically, while the very same mechanism which allowed this to happen (a window for further imprinting appears to be open up until the end of puberty), appears likely to allow for the possibility for all manner of imprints, of all manner of weird fetishes, to be passed on also. For all one knows, one could have inherited their bizarre fetish from their grandfather, or even could pass on to their children.

Wait, what? Are you suggesting the imprints themselves can be passed on?

An example. Suppose one fantasizes that out of their own volition they get to grow wings using some magic device and then fly around. The fantasy focuses on the bodily sensations of the change, the feelings of power, freedom (not on how you look), feeling 'special'. If characters appear in the fantasy, they react with surprise (worry, fascination?), not scorn.

What makes you say this? Can you give specific examples of the kind of observations you have made that point you towards this theory?  You seem to imply that the overt emotional/narrative framing of a fantasy is essentially irrelevant to how it is sexually processed (kind of Freudian btw) .

What agp subpopulations are we talking about?

One of them wasn't euphoric in any way; I just kept cycling around the thought ""why am I identifying with her? why am I identifying with her?; I think that second phenomenon still belongs to the general sphere of sexuality and does not reflect any all-encompassing deep gendered self (I doubt that even exists), but it lacked the kinky proto-arousal and was definitely something else."

The idea of undergoing a transformation (especially, but not necessarily, if an external power forces the transformation upon you) can function as an erotic trigger in and of itself, regardless of the target. The phenomenon is very complicated because it encompasses the erotization of different narratives, internal sensations, and feelings which are not always masochistic and sometimes in direct opposition to each other:  power, vulnerability, feeling trapped, feeling unfettered. It is possible to be aroused by TF fantasies with a gazillion different targets without any of them being attractive to the individual in any sort of fashion and without eventually coming to experience any sort of matching dysphoria."
