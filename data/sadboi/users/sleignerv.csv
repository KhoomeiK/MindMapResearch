SelfCareCharts,fpxg9z9,t1_fpwd1qz,1588982115.0,"This is true. Support for complex PTSD as its own disorder is building though, with doctors recognizing the need to acknowledge the consequences of repeated trauma vs a single event. In this case, I believe the DSM is behind in recognizing it as a unique condition. I personally am interested in seeing how CPTSD develops, especially as it relates to BPD."
BPDSOFFA,fptlig8,t3_gbh49p,1588893501.0,"She's not being a good friend, and you deserve someone (many people) telling you that this is not healthy for you and you deserve a better relationship from her, if you want to keep it.

That said, she may not realize the extent to which she's really being unhealthy, and/or taking advantage of your relationship, because you've been so caring and tolerant of it. This is **not** blaming you in the slightest. Speaking up, especially to someone with BPD, can be difficult and (honestly) frightening. It might not seem worth the trouble especially with (what sounds like) the social clout she has among her circles. But I doubt that confidence is truly substantial if she is bubbly among many and very negative one-on-one.

Have you tried distancing yourself from her, and if so does she still seek you out and/or depend on your presence? If that's the case, she probably needs you more than she's willing to admit. It's up to you to decide if you want to move on, or keep her in your life. But if you decide to work through it, I think being honest and transparent with how the friendship is harming you is the most important thing you can do for yourself.

I say this because, once upon a time, I was that toxic friend. And it took a very empathetic friend who finally couldn't take it anymore to say ""I know you're going through stuff right now, and I'm sorry you're in pain, but I cannot be the person you vent to and then yell at. I'm sorry."" I have since made amends with her but she has no interest in getting close again and I completely accept it. She was also working through issues and is now happy in a better place, and I'm working to get there (independently) as well.

I hope this offers some help while also offering a different perspective. You sound very thoughtful and caring but exhausted, and that's entirely okay. I hope things get better for you!"
BPD,fptipcs,t1_fps87jy,1588891982.0,"This. I will be transparent and say I don't know if I was every formally diagnosed, as I was referred to and completed an entire cycle of DBT, and because of fear/stigma I had associated with the label of BPD my therapist refused to tell me whether she added it to my record. Regardless, DBT helped tremendously, as does this forum, which helps me feel like I'm not alone when I feel absolutely awful and ashamed at my actions, and want so badly to change but find it very difficult to without help.

I can't imagine wanting to feel this way, especially knowing the pain it's caused to myself and others that I love. I'd like to imagine this is what differentiates between glorifying behaving like shit and living with BPD... but I feel happy with the support in this forum to believe there are similar people here."
BPD,fptgm3h,t1_fpsme44,1588890880.0,Hang in there. Sometimes those words help. I hope it's not taking too much of a toll on you in return.

BPD,fpqkghq,t3_gexiy7,1588824909.0,"Call your therapist. It's not a sign to end anything, but probably a lot to process for you right now. Please give a chance for your body, your mind and your heart to heal a little more <3"
BPD,fpqenaj,t1_fppvldt,1588821078.0,">There are good people out there who won’t screw you over. I just started talking to this guy and I have never met anyone funnier and genuine. He reciprocates my energy and I don’t even have to manipulate the situation by prompting validation situations.

I came here to reply to this exact quote, and now I'm cheering on this reply as well!  


In the past few months I've experienced the reward of authentically connecting into a moment with someone as opposed to constantly keeping tabs on the conversation and steering it in a direction that's always GREAT FUNNY HAPPY VALIDATING and it feels SO liberating. It took a long time to resist that urge of wanting to ""entertain"" and just... answer. This OP and reply was so great to see!"
BPD,fppp88s,t3_gen8px,1588806500.0,"Oooof this resonates with me <3.

Your emotions are **always** valid. But we can make space for other things  -like our thoughts and values - to help drive how we perceive and act. It can be **really hard** to know how to do this on our own, so that's where things like therapy help.

The process of developing those habits/skills does not change who you are. Just finding a better outlet for the massive amount of emotions we feel! My own personal bane of BPD is not being able to trust my gut as much as others do - I envy those that can have a ""gut feeling"" and not have to doubt or overthink it because they believe their gut's reliable! I split often with my current partner, who has made a *lot* of mistakes in the past, and it's difficult to know where I'm overreacting and where my conclusions are founded. It's okay to be upset, it's okay to feel anxious or untrusting or unheard or ignored or betrayed or alone or unloved. For me, learning how to fuse all those feelings in with a little of fact checking and value comparing, has really empowered me to believe my emotions are me, *and* that they're meaningful and trustworthy compass for my life."
BPD,fppnm39,t3_geolrc,1588805631.0,"Similar to what u/HeyHoney86 said... we're putting ourselves out there in a very vulnerable way. Especially when there's a literal metric where you can judge the impact of your posts, the validation of an upvote or another comment feels *so good*, and relative silence from no comments or upvote (or even a downvote) feels just as cold as in-person rejection.

A self-exercise in love for yourself and your standpoint is a good way of looking at it. If what you're looking for in a social interaction is the validation and praise of others, not getting it will feel twice as worse. Let the reward be that you put yourself out there honestly, and truthfully, and that you survived it regardless of the outcome. All this to say I had to practice this for the last twelve months and it's still not perfect! But not receiving validation and praise has been much less painful for me."
BPD,fpm87qo,t1_fpm7u5g,1588727559.0,"Thank you... 🙏 Knowing that I've cheated has been the worst burden of them all to carry for me, and the worst to recover from. It helps to know what others have done, and that growing is possible."

BPD,fpdha6h,t3_gcpxtb,1588526967.0,"...I can relate. Keep going back and forth between: ""Life is what we make of it!"" and ""...Is this all life is, just waves of effort to override loneliness?"" Especially with quarantine, it feels like the days are passing by. If you ever feel lonely feel free to message!"
BPD,fpdgttg,t3_gcl26d,1588526713.0,"I hear you! I have the desire as you but with the opposite reaction: I'm a SUPER sensitive person, and by virtue of that am anxious about how much I share because I read into nonverbal cues and automatically think people will judge me. So I tend to keep people at a distance.   
Playing devil's advocate here... she might be communicating to you right off the bat a tendency to reflect on as a way to possibly improve how to connect with others. Granted, if she told that to me immediately, that would REALLY put me off balance and make me feel stupid too, but I guess it depends on the type of relationship she wants to set with you? Anyway... regardless(!) please don't feel like an idiot! You are not at all. <3"
BPD,fpdfyr2,t3_gcp3jp,1588526234.0,"Definitely relatable. Quarantine has really highlighted how uncomfortable I feel when I see friends Zoom-chatting each other every night, because they feel close enough to do so. A lot of the friendships I've made are more at a distance and I'm so envious that I wasn't at a place where I felt like I belonged to a friend-family unit before quarantine happened. I want to feel included in a unit but just haven't felt that connection with any group to do so."
BPD,fpc6s0w,t3_gcdhyx,1588489506.0,"I'd say to be prepared and okay with whatever happens, as last as it's clear where he stands with you. Better than spiraling in what ifs, but would say to be prepared for any answer you may receive."
BPD,foknunu,t3_g7g8br,1587845581.0,"I actually had to look it up a few days ago when I started seeing it. I'm not of the Tumblr generation, so wasn't sure what this was until I saw it was made there. It's not a diagnostic term at all. Perhaps the *concept* of an FP should be though, because it is a pretty on-target manifestation for a lot of BPD-related behavior and thought-processes, like splitting/idolizing, need for validation, and fulfilling the absence of a sense of self. Having an ""FP"" provides a good target for all of those things. 

The BPD diagnosis is new for me but I've had these tendencies all my life. It sends shivers down my spine when I read about something (even culturally defined), and I think of times where I've done that EXACT thing, or role played a scene in my head where I received a great deal of approval and admiration from this one specific person. I think EVERYONE does this to an extent, but BPD peeps are more prone to these types of things. I'm not a big fan of the name, but something like it should probably be mentioned officially to help those become aware of when it happens, and the unhealthy attachment it can foster."
