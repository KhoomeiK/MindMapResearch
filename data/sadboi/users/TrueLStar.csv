relationships,fqiyu4z,t3_gj1gdz,1589402741.0,"I had a similar thing happen with my husband who I was with for a total of 6 years. I come from an emotionally abusive family and it eventually caught up with me when I tried to go to college and live in the real world. My decline was gradual but severe and I ended up in a mental hospital for a week because my therapist was scared. 

I was trying everything I could. I went to therapy. I took medication. I even did partial hospitalization for months. During this time my husband was obviously experiencing stress as well. He wanted to go do things but I couldn't get out of bed. I told him to go to therapy and sent him information for support groups but for some reason he never went. He grew more and more distant from me. Over a period of 6 or so months he had bonded with this other girl that I had expressed concern over because they did everything together and I knew she had feelings for him. He ignored me and I grew tired of seeing another woman steadily taking my husband away. While I was in the hospital the first night he went to a party with her while I cried alone in my bed. After that I asked for a divorce and now they are dating.

I guess what I'm trying to say is that being with someone isnt always going to be fun and smooth sailing. Get her into therapy, get her on medication, be there for her. I know it feels hopeless. It's not easy but it takes time and effort. I'm here about 2 years later and I can live again. I'm doing good in school, am partaking in my hobbies again, and I'm in a healthy relationship. I'm happy again. Part of me is sad that my ex husband isnt here to see it, but I dont want to be with someone who would abandon me like that anyway. 

If shes not willing to try, then theres nothing you can do. I admit that she has to have the want to change. 

If you truly want out though, leave. And dont drag it out. My ex dragged it out and emotionally cheated until I called it off. We are depressed, not stupid. We can feel when someone is pulling away. When they are developing feelings for others. Rip the bandaid off sooner than later so she can get on with your life and you as well. 

Good luck with whatever you decide."
