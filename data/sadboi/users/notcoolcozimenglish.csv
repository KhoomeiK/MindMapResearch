MakeUpAddictionUK,fp2ftln,t1_fp1s4pa,1588261027.0,This is the second post I have seen about people talking about bargains and encouraging people to pop the shops for some make up. I love make up but itâ€™s irresponsible to advertise this. Itâ€™s make-up not medicine imagine how many people will go to the shops when itâ€™s not needed to get a bargain. Think of the people that have to go to the pharmacy for people at risk you could be asymptomatic and pass it on. If Iâ€™m being dramatic please stop me but donâ€™t cry when you kill someone because you wanted Â£5 off your mascara that no one can see.
