Gums had grown over the shards of broken teeth still in the sockets. Inflammation in my jaw was huge, the pain horrid. I don't doo well with pain meds, fucks my stomach. Lotsa n lots of ibuprofen and a tube of oragel a day almost. It's been immense improvement, but being said I legit only have front teeth, and eating is not painful but exceptionally hard. Hoping my new job has good dental as ill be needing implants soon, my jaw hurts alot due to excessive chewing and the effort I put on my front teeth now. But like I said infinetly better. I sleep n eat, jaw swollen down, gum colour returning. My gums would fill with puss pockets and randomly break, so gross. It was a post like this someone pointed me to income support office.

Make sure the doctor write down the problem. Key words, infection, serious, emergency. I just had 6500 worth done. They will grant you all the work you need in a 30 day period. Sometimes the low income office has a form they want filled, I just had a quote done. Tell the dentist it's for low income support and they won't charge for the consultation either. Cheers, all the best I know how bad teeth can get, and it was a huge part of my depression as well.
