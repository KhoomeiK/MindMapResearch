How does that back up your claim they have nothing? It was more of a mic drop and a walk off, followed by a here's your perp. That really says to you they have nothing??

So what if there's been silence? It's an investigation they are conducting. You think we will hear about every little move they make? They announce things either when they have new evidence to release and want the public's help or when they have an arrest. And considering the podcast came out and all were apart of making that, I wouldn't consider that to be complete silence. I've heard things on that that we hadn't heard before from different perspectives that sheds even more light on it.

I don't get what your whole point is with all this. All it reads is that you think we should be privileged to more info and that you think they suck at what they're doing. Then you discount what others are telling you, only criticizing it. How does a post like this help? I've said over and over just look more into things.

DelphiMurders,fl5g8z0,t1_fl5dlgp,1584836006.0,">Releasing whether or not a gun was used, doesn't have any effect on the public knowing the cause of death.

That tells me you really don't understand how tactics work in investigations.

And let's assume it won't have any ill effects on it (which most would disagree with but ok), what good effects will it have? Why do you need to know that? What good will come of it? What is the point? Why do we have the privilege of knowing how these girls exactly died when it is an active investigation? And even after it's solved what privilege do we have knowing that. We aren't the girl's family, we aren't law enforcement, and we aren't the killer. It's nice to feel in the loop but it's not always necessary to be in the loop.

I completely disagree about the last press conference. In fact it was after watching it did I think ""oh fuck they know who it is"". The words he said, how he said it, where he looked, etc., all gave clues to that. Couple that with other info that is out there if you dig around and put it together, then it speaks loudly to all that. Even in the podcast the woman podcaster who was there at the very front of it said she thought he was going to go make an arrest right after he stopped talking. That's how obvious it was they knew way more then, than they had before. The change of sketch is because they found something out that they hadn't known before. His emotions spoke that he was pissed. Pissed because they are so close but the person is still untouchable. 

Many cases have had investigators sure it was someone due to circumstances and other things. They interviewed them, they kept a close eye on them, etc. But they couldn't make an arrest because conclusive evidence was missing. It wasn't until later when they had it did they arrest that person. And I don't just mean DNA. Other things that came out. I think that is the case here. They strongly think it's someone and need that conclusive piece. That is why he was frustrated at the PC. That's why he said those things he said. They very obviously have more info than they had before. That sketch is very purposeful. His words were very purposeful. 

I would implore you to do more searches on this case. Really dig around. Look at what is being said. Then put pieces together and see if they fit. After you  find out some more dirt, watch the PC again. It should start to make more sense if you found the right clues."
DelphiMurders,fl5ci38,t1_fl5a8bc,1584833534.0,"Saying there were multiple signatures is all they said. They did not say what they were. Everything else is speculation. And that's all they want for us. Speculation but not knowledge. Maybe he positioned the bodies but maybe he didn't. Maybe he mutilated them but maybe he didn't. Only the killer knows and LE. And that's all who they want to know right now and have said that multiple times.

What would come from us, the regular folk, to know the cause of death, other than to satiate our curiosity? What could that really do for this case? Say we find out they were shot. And? Everyone there owns a gun. Any digging around about a gun LE can do on their own. Let's say they were stabbed or had their throats slit. What do we do with that information that LE can't do?

I get everyone wants to know. As humans we are curious creatures. But this same subject of ""if only LE would release some info about how they died..."" comes up almost every other day, here and elsewhere. All from regular folk that somehow think that will be the clincher. It's repetitive and beating a dead horse quite frankly.

And there seem to be about half of the people thinking they are desperate and have nothing and half the people that think they have a lot and are very close. I happen to be of the latter. I think they have a ton and just missing, like they even said, that last piece to tie this all up. I think they know who did it. And I and some others, are leaning toward certain figures as well. But they just need a concrete piece so they don't fuck it up and have it thrown out. There are many clues out there that they are leaning towards someone. People good with details and subtleties can see it. If someone says they think they have nothing and are desperate, then they aren't seeing the things being thrown out there.

I will say though I think most of us don't pay much mind to people screaming in normal settings, especially in places where kids and teens hang out.

memes,fko6rgi,t1_fko5j19,1584381205.0,"I mean I'm glad you got tested but it's not easy to do unless those circumstances come up unfortunately. Many more people are sick and probably have it yet can't get tested because they weren't knowingly exposed. If places like South Korea can have drive up testing areas for anyone for free, why can't the U.S.?"

much as hearing about the coronavirus is annoying, it's more annoying hearing about Epstein constantly ngl. I mean at least the virus thing is relevant to now and while he could have named other perpetrators, he was one himself and I don't think anyone's crying over his loss. The ones that are out there may still be taken down, but there's at least one less. Just saying."
memes,fko2360,t1_fko0it7,1584378602.0,Yeah same here and yet I get downvoted lol. But I'm wondering how that other person got tested so easily and where. And it's still part of the problem because we are contagious before we are symptomatic. That is why it has spread so much. People don't always know that they've been exposed either. Only testing certain people that knowingly have been exposed is not going to help. Now our city is shutting down here and had we done more tests we wouldn't be in this mess.

There are so many little innuendos and clues that Carter has said in various things that I believe circumstances are pointing them to a certain person(s) but they are trying to make it a concrete case. The last thing they want to do is go through the process of charging and prosecuting only to have it thrown out or found not guilty because of lack of concrete evidence. They don't want to fail this family.

Vent,fkkzadf,t3_fj2epd,1584295107.0,"Someone in government where you're at needs to step in and make it mandatory for daycares to waive their fees. If they are saying to lessen contact and have kids in groups of 3 or less (which is what I read) then with all of their rules the daycare rule should be added. Maybe some kind of petition could be started and gain traction fast if spread online. I'm sure other parents in many places are going through the same thing.

Our schools are closed here as well, for the next 6 weeks, and I'm not happy either as my kid is out that long. But because I also work in schools, I'm off and can be there, although I'm not thrilled about being off that long either. I honestly thought it would be only about 2 weeks, certainly not 6. But I feel for parents that don't have anywhere for their kids to go and have to put them in daycare. It's just as much of a health hazard there as it is in schools, defeating the purpose."
DelphiMurders,fkj480z,t1_fkixic5,1584235792.0,I'm thinking that has to do with what the crime scene looked like. Maybe the bodies were hidden in way or positioned where you couldn't easily see them. That goes back to not wanting to reveal the crime scene details.

Felt better after about 4 days and had to go back to work (if they had tested me and it came back positive, I would have had a legit excuse to stay out more time because of the quarantine rules).
I guarantee there are many people who have/had it and don't know because of lack of testing, therefore spreading it more. And that's part of the problem on how it got to this point."
aww,fkhzhw9,t3_fihxl7,1584208893.0,"What bothers me about some of the wording, and about some of these judgmental comments, is where he said ""not now"" and therefore some are saying she shouldn't have gotten the cat. Are we living in the 1950s where woman acted like their husband is their father and ask their permission before doing anything? Discussing it and talking about the pros and cons should have happened, but straight up saying, ""honey can we get a cat?"" ""Not now dear"" ""Ok"" doesn't need to be how it happens either. The rest of the wording where it says we compromised and got the cat does not necessarily mean she just went ahead and did it on her own. It could mean that they talked about it and decided to go ahead and do it/she convinced him to do it too.

I get that there are people that abandon pets because they didn't think things through. But that doesn't mean it's the case here and if people are going to be upset they should also be upset that one person in the relationship has to get the other one's sole permission to do something."
