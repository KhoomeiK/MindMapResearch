AmItheAsshole,f6o41d5,t3_ds8vno,1573007193.0,NTA. I am a girl who's best friend is also a gay man (altho we actually are pretty touchy cause I'm just affectionate in general) and people assume we are a couple all the time! It's for sure annoying but obviously after 6 yrs of friendship we arent going to date eachother and it would be a dealbreaker for me if a dude had an issue with him (which they never have). People need friends!

NoStupidQuestions,f3zhusy,t3_dixxsu,1571269399.0,Because it sounds cheaper
mentalhealth,f3zgytg,t3_dijt4y,1571268902.0,Thank you for this post. One of my best friends has been MIA for almost a yr. Shes sent a couple texts but ignored many more I sent and it hurts especially bad bc I also have depression and one of my biggest triggers is abandonment(and she knows it). I'm trying to be understanding but it can be hard from my own perspective to not feel so dejected. It's helpful to see that other people do this as well
TooAfraidToAsk,f3w3dag,t3_diexag,1571191017.0,"All the time. The funniest though was when walking through a grocery store with my gay friend in a small town. I looked over at him and said ""dude they're all looking at me :("" and he responded ""bringmethepotatos, I'm wearing a sarong right now, no one is looking at you"""

vegan,exkpk4x,t1_exk4pui,1566395923.0,"My guess is that people hate it bc its usually made with GMOs and contains traces of trans fats (like all oils, but slightly more than most). I don't think enough research is there to back up his claims of it being ""impossible for your body to process"" tho. People read shit on facebook and think they're nutritionists lol."

AmItheAsshole,evzusjt,t3_cm4689,1564967854.0,"NTA. She's probably just a little sensitive and/or embaressed that she got called out, but you aren't wrong at all. You don't need to go to the hospital too! I would just give her time to chill out and maybe do something nice for her if you can"
Vent,evzuksy,t3_cm46cc,1564967689.0,"Could you give her the money back? Did you explain the situation to her? If you don't need a car but you do need that money for therapy than it seems like an obvious choice not to get it. She probably just wants to help you which is nice but you can tell her no, but maybe add in how grateful you are for her and how much you love her but you want her to spend her money and herself or something. Mental health should come first!!! Good on you for seeing that and I wish you luck OP 💖"

NotHowDrugsWork,etvhmro,t1_etu18p0,1563235639.0,People say that cbd gets them high all the time. Probs placebo but whatever. When they first started selling it at this head shop near me they literally told me it would get me fucked up🙄 its common misinformation
NoStupidQuestions,etqfjdm,t3_cczgft,1563082937.0,Loud sex is not something I enjoy hearing from roommates but it's also not the worst thing? It is pretty rude though. I usually try to use my boxfan and/or tv to combat the various annoying noises other people make.
needadvice,etkvfqa,t3_cc6fn4,1562910114.0,"I too dropped all of my classes my first go round, although I fucked up worse and did it twice 😭😬 dropped so many classes I actually got suspended. I was fortunate though that I had some money saved, so after waiting to not be suspended I went back to community college and did the two classes a semester thing. (Which btw took me two years to get up to their standards, but it doesnt sound like you fucked up as badly as I did) 

The frustrating thing with the fafsa stuff is its your class completion % that it goes off, do you know the percentage of completed to dropped classes you have? If you took two semesters and only dropped one, you might only need to take these two classes to get it back up! Are you trying to go back to community college or straight to a university? Bc community college is much cheaper, my school at least had a payment plan option and it was usually abt 1000 dollars per semester for two classes. Hopefully with a playment plan that can be manageable? You may have to work a little extra or ask family for money, but it can be done(even if you have to wait a while and save up)! Sorry that was jumbled but I just want you to know that it's so great that you figured out what you wanna do and are going back to do it! It's gonna be rough, but you know your goal and that's at least half the battle!"
bisexual,ethgu87,t3_cbq9wd,1562815120.0,Not weird at all! I tend to be more attracted to women but at the same time date men way more often. Only bc I have no game with ladies 😓
FiftyFifty,ethgp4k,t3_cbq9yc,1562815003.0,I'm so thankful for that post that called out how sfw this sub has become. Never disappointed anymore lmfao
offmychest,ethfvo0,t3_cbqar1,1562814355.0,"It's good that you recognize how hard they work for you and that you aren't taking advantage of them. I'm sure they don't think of you as a burden, and helping you is something they must truly desire to do, so you honestly shouldn't feel bad. That being said, maybe it would help your concious and them a bit if you found some part time work? It's rough to take classes and work, but there are plenty of odd job things you could try to do, or working for your school. My school offers lots of teaching jobs for students and it would probably help with your resume! Just a thought, but regardless good luck with your classes!😊"
trees,estdjmv,t3_c961e8,1562265566.0,Could it be CBD weed? That would be an interesting scam. I've never smoked it before but Ive heard it's hard to tell the difference (beyond there being no thc of course). Just a guess 🤷‍♀️

NotHowGirlsWork,eq7zn5g,t1_eq7xgta,1559856014.0,Idk no one ever taught me? And I hadn't really had to pee outside many times. I figured it out myself as a child and just kept doing it the hard way cause that's all I knew. Somethings are intuitive to some people and somethings are not 🤷‍♀️

TooAfraidToAsk,eowd5vh,t3_btdltd,1558908254.0,"So I recently took an art history class and I think one of the reasons is bc they are often made by people who CAN do traditional art, but that isn't what they're trying to do. Abstract art originated(I'm assuming popularly) by highly talented/trained artists who were stepping away from traditional art and making a statement. A lot of art that ""could be made by a 5 year old"" has meaning behind it, but not all. Sometimes the meaning was simply that there was no meaning. Look into Marcel Duchamp, he entered a urinal to a gallery. It was a statement."

NoStupidQuestions,eoagole,t3_br6hof,1558417357.0,"It depends on what you want and what artist you want. If you have an idea of at least the size and amount of detail in a piece you want you could call a shop and ask for a general estimate (I've never done this before but I feel like they would probs at least give you an idea). And then if you want a really good artist they usually charge by the hour so you could ask their hourly rate. You'll only know what they charge tho exactly when you have an actual piece and artist pegged out. If you want something small and/or simple and aren't too worried about getting a special artist, I would say at least have 100 dollars you are willing to spend."
