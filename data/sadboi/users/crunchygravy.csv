bipolar2,fqo6fir,t1_fqo5d7l,1589508527.0,Like Meyer Briggs? I've heard of that but not those specific letters. Do you mind sharing what they mean? I am an ISTJ.
medical,fqo6a25,t1_fqnt7av,1589508438.0,"Not just spider bite, but this looks like a brown recluse bite. I had one 16 years ago. The doctor cleaned it out, gave me strong antibiotics that I had to take for a month and I had to keep it bandaged (it was on my middle finger). It did slough off skin as the antibiotics took effect. It basically kills off the tissue around the wound. Super gross. It took a couple months to fully heal. The skin has to regrow and refill that hole. That area was extra sensitive for years. All that is left now is a tiny scar, the size of 2 grains of rice. 

Please go to the doctor. Without proper treatment it will turn into staph and spread."

personalfinance,fqivhty,t3_gj0z9b,1589401447.0,"Be careful, though. If you are 18 and attending college, any cash that is in a savings or checking account is weighed much heavier than cash assets that are in a parents account, and that also includes any student income from sources other than a work-study job:  [https://thecollegefinanciallady.com/2019/09/03/efc-formula-guide-2020-2021-fafsa-basics/](https://thecollegefinanciallady.com/2019/09/03/efc-formula-guide-2020-2021-fafsa-basics/)"

AskWomen,fpvxhex,t3_gfo6fm,1588953587.0,"I had given myself the entire summer to date following a divorce that had been long overdue. My youngest was at camp most of the summer so I ""marathon"" dated to my heart's content. One date for lunch, another for dinner, etc. My end date was August when my kid would be home and back in school. By October I realized that he was so busy with after school clubs and friends that I still had a lot of time on my hands and I decided to give an app one last try. 

I have HSV II (herpes) so it was an app to meet others with HSV II. I sat down with a glass of wine and joined the chat room online, and besides the trolls and ""Chads"", there was one guy who was funny, wrote in complete sentences and seemed to be smart. He lived across the country so we decided to be online friends. We spent three hours chatting that night. We exchanged emails and over the weekend, emailed back and forth maybe 5 times? We covered a lot of ground like family background, hobbies, work, stuff like that. 

On Monday, I asked him to Skype with me and OH MY GOD, he was so handsome in ""real life"", so much better than his photos. And we just clicked. We spent 100+ hours Skyping, chatting, getting to know each other. I would carry my laptop into the kitchen while I made dinner, he showed me his cats and dog. And we fell in love.

Three months from the day we met online, he quit his job, packed up his stuff and drove 3000 miles to move in with me, a day before my birthday. That was in January 2016. We were married in October 2018 and he is my best friend, an amazing husband and an incredible human being. We now have three dogs, my youngest is in college and we're enjoying our empty nest. Life is awesome."

BipolarReddit,fps9btz,t1_fprf7vo,1588869642.0,"This is why this subreddit is so critical for me. I can read posts and comments and connect. This is where we all speak the same language.

BipolarReddit,fpqc2vl,t3_gewwwv,1588819483.0,"Absolutely. I think everyone is just putting up with me. That they roll their eyes when they turn their back. So I don't over share, I keep it light and shiny."

Edit: reading everyone's experiences makes me thankful for this community."
eldertrees,fmucizd,t3_fxd724,1586388724.0,"When my son left for college last August, we purchased a vape pen for him. One cartridge. He has a history of anxiety and he's now 5 hours from home. He was home over spring break and I asked him about it. He said he's used it on and off when he got stressed. He took some edibles home with him to try those instead. As long as it's helping him focus on schoolwork and alleviate the anxiety from living away from home, I have no problem with his use. If he told me he was toking it up every night, we'd have a talk about tolerance and using it responsibly. Leading by example works for us. Communication is key."
norcalhiking,fmjqn76,t3_fvjlw5,1586135724.0,Take a week and head up to Siskiyou county. There are 66 waterfalls and most you can access. An easy trail is Hedge Creek Falls. The trail winds behind the waterfall and history says that the cave behind the falls was Black Bart's hideout. He was an infamous stagecoach robber and it's said that he stored his treasure there.

I would use grays, a soft white with yellow base, Navy and mustard. A white and Navy striped rug can look fresh and modern.

Wellthatsucks,f97q9ga,t1_f976ih1,1575168911.0,I have a similar x-ray but they put a plate and six screws in my fibula as well. I broke it at age 40 and my surgeon said a plate was necessary since my bone growth has slowed considerably at my age. Are you younger? That could be why you don't have a plate?

Insurance rates are skyrocketing on the property side thanks to the recent fires here in CA. I had a student housing apartment complex increase from $14,131 last year to $41k+ this year. I have an apartment complex in the foothills near Tahoe coming in at $44k. Premium last year? $5,000. Guess who is going to suffer the most with these jacked up rates? :-("
