Just imagine if you reconnected with someone and just wore your heart on your sleeve, just imagine if you just told them like it is? What would can go wrong? They already dont pay much attention to you, so they could either go back to doing that OR it could maybe help them realize that a ""friend"" just needs some love. 

Idk, I am no expert so take what I say as a grain of salt. Humans are a busy race, we all have life moving in every direction. So catching someone when they are open is difficult. I have an issue with finding friends to, but I just keep trying. I wear my heart on my sleeve, i tell people 100% like it is and I love everyone more than they understand. It confuses people when I show so much openness, but I do that and know that nobody can hurt me because there is only the two options I shared above ^. 

Have you ever tried to volunteer? Idk what it is, but it changed me helping people out and never expecting anything in return. And honestly, music festivals changed me.
