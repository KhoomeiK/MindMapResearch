I'm taking the KS-23M for example: it does 37 damage per pellet up to 60 studs. so we halve that to 19.25. now, that does 99.25 damage, for **4** pellets with very little spread. in reality, your hitting with 6 or 7 pellets. 5 pellets at any range is a kill. guns like the aa12/saiga can land 5 pellets very easily, after all, they can fire 64 very quickly.

&#x200B;

ways to fix this:

fire damage is 5 per second regardless of pellets

maximum range decrease - ks23m from 60-110 to 30-80. pellets also fade after 160 studs (twice the min range)

spread is not changed

damage is not changed either

&#x200B;

this would make it balanced, but not as ridiculously op as you have it as"
PhantomForces,fq5kimd,t3_ggpbds,1589108878.0,"I have also been playing since early beta, and have taken very few breaks (a month here and there at most).

&#x200B;

Phantom Forces is different to any shooter I've played (haven't played CoD or Battlefield), in that it doesn't focus heavily on precision like R6, or movement like Titanfall, or bullet count like other games.

&#x200B;

I agree with the first point; KS-23M has been known to one tap at over 150 studs fairly reliable. DB on burst can one tap to similar distances. No other shotgun can compete at those ranges, while its still well within any auto's use range. And any Auto will win at that range. At the moment, the strongest shotgun up close is the Saiga. It struggles to kill at even 80 studs. The R870 struggles at 100. There are thousands of downsides to all shotguns, all focused around fire rate, damage at range, reload, mobility. While the one tap range on **2** shotguns is fairly broken, the rest are balanced.

&#x200B;

LMGs are not broken in the slightest. They do not need a reserve nerf; that would make them literally unusable. They are heavily punished in terms of mobility and reload; the M60 has one of the slowest movement speeds in the game and faces over 8 seconds of reload time. Th MG3, again, has incredibly poor movement and faces a 6+ second reload time. Their wall pen is a different story, and I agree that needs to be nerfed slightly, but again, not a massive nerf, maybe from 3 pen depth to 2, rather than removing it entirely.

&#x200B;

I really hope you don't actually think that last suggestion is a good idea - a blanket nerf on damage would kill the game. Bearing in mind your average gunfight lasts just under a second, and thats between 2 good players with guns with a low TTK (normally around 0.1 seconds). Because people miss shots. Between 2 average players, a gunfight can easily take 2-3 seconds already; a nerf there would have them shooting each other the whole match. Getting shot in the back is part of it anyway - use sound, learn the maps and you can avoid this. And what are you using so that you need a secondary anyway, if you're running around the map you should have a reliable secondary equipped anyway, or your primary should handle it.

&#x200B;

The points you raise have been raised before, however you have written it out a lot more than any I've seen before, so respect for that, and thanks for showing these points again, because quite simply, some of them are true, and something needs to be done.

Unfortunately there is no legal obligation to do it and some hotels & motels profit off of sexual exploitation taking place in their rooms.

I know of at least one case where a hotel manager realised that somebody was attempting to check into a room with an underage boy in order to sexually abuse him..... and then asked for additional money because he knew the man wouldn’t argue.

Many of the photos in the database were obtained from publicly available resources, such as hotel websites. However the app is very valuable in adding photos of hotels and motels that are not available online. The photos uploaded via the app more closely resemble photos taken by traffickers, which makes them even more valuable to law enforcement.

Photos taken by guests can also help to pinpoint a room and a time. For example, on traffickcam you input a room number. You can also see details which may be unique to that room even if all of them are decorated the same such as what can be seen out of the window, damage to a wall etc. This helps to document the subtle differences in how a room may look over time. This can help investigators work out exactly when and where an offence took place, and hopefully cross reference it with booking records. 

The Exchange Initiative who created this unfortunately do not have the funding to be doing the proactive work that would be required to get hotels to do this. They rely heavily on social media and word of mouth.

I’m sure there’s lots of great hotel owners out there who would be happy to upload if they knew about TraffickCam but the barrier is making them aware in the first place."
