BipolarReddit,f3edbvg,t3_dgolpw,1570870372.0,"Yes, this component I like to see, recognize, discuss, bring to the fore, as completely SEPARATE to the experience of feeling down, hopeless, filled with despair. What I like to reframe for myself as DEPRESSION is perhaps better stated as “PUSH DOWN”: 
my vocabulary is pushed way down, 
my reflexes are pushed way down, 
my capacity to multi-task is pushed way down, 
my attention and focus is pushed way down, 
my creativity is pushed way down, 
my lateral thinking and brainstorming, are pushed WAY down. 

Again the age old assumption that depression means I’m sad and down and tearful, needs to be challenged through people telling their lived experiences. 

Yes, when I’m depressed, I’m morbidly obsessed with taking my life. It becomes an almost fantastical all consuming mission that simply refuses to go away without lithium. But again, for me, it can and does co-exist with what appears to be a normal functioning life - at least for the 6 or so months that I’m in a depressive episode. No one would see me in a fetal position sobbing. Yet every second of the day, stepping in front of a truck, is a very likely compulsion. 

This is my reality of bipolar depression. It may sound strange to some. However, through deepening my awareness over the years (I’m 45) I’ve come to see these experiences as peripheral phenomena that my psychiatrist needs to be informed about ASAP. I soldier on waiting with gratitude for the trusted medication to perform their functions. Thank you for this post. You are a survivor. Never forget that."

bipolar2,f30lv7d,t3_deuzq4,1570557224.0,"Hello you, thank you for posting. I hear your frustrations. I’m bipolar and my 15 year old daughter was diagnosed a month ago after spending a week in ICU because she took enough paracetamol to kill a grown man. She then went on to spend three weeks in a pediatric psychiatric ward for therapy and like yourself until her mood was stable. They started her on 800mg lithium and I think she noticed an improvement after a week. In my opinion they discharged her in a mixed state - a tad on the depressed side. But a ton better than she was going in. She’s subsequently had a dose bump up and is doing much better. I would be interested to hear your story in terms of your mood before admission and what medication you were on, what you think catapulted you into this current hypomanic state and what have they suggested to stabilize you. Wishing you everything of the best."
bipolar2,f30kr5h,t3_df1asy,1570556528.0,Hello peachesn- You know I have the same problem. It’s extremely hard and until now I haven’t found non pharmaceutical way to deal with it. I take seroquel 50mg in the evening without which I would be watching my mind as entertainment till early hours. Especially when I’m hypomanic. My daughter is 15 diagnosed bp2 and also uses seroquel to calm the mind before bedtime. I hope this helps.
bipolar2,f30equx,t3_df1p36,1570552790.0,Hello neuraltransmission and thank you for the post. I’ve been using topirimate 100mg for probably 2 years now. When we started I went up incrementally every 3-5 days by 25mg I think it was until we reached 100mg. I had dry mouth as a side effect which disappeared. My weight went down which was great because I had gained some on the SSRI. I will be honest with you in terms of a mood stabilizer is wasn’t effective for me. I have stayed on it because it controls my migraines. For my mood stability I needed lithium. SUMMARY: Weight-loss awesome / mood stability not so much / migraine control awesome / staying on it indefinitely

bipolar2,f2jkjr4,t3_ddkhcq,1570273857.0,What a terrible experience. As the son of a specialist in a fairly small town I’ve realized that the way I get treated is very different compared to family of non medical practitioners. Have you considered that the psychiatrist knew your situation before seeing you? And do you think that could’ve played a role?  Sometimes specialist don’t want to treat family of doctors because of the high risk and use passive aggressive tactics to try fob you off on someone else. I’m just speculating I could be completely wrong. Once I’m so sorry for what you are going through.
