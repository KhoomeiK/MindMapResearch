SuicideWatch,feeqszj,t3_eokkma,1579039242.0,Hugs are the best. I love them. Sending you lots of hugs.
SuicideWatch,fe5rmpq,t3_enscwk,1578873601.0,Right on!
SuicideWatch,fe5rgms,t3_enqks5,1578873547.0,Life can be cruel. I know. It can also be beautiful. You just can't see that now. That's ok. Find someone that can help you to see the light again. Sending you lots of love....
therapy,fdh14jn,t3_elc866,1578413105.0,You don't have to write anything down. Just think of one goal you want to reach after a few sessions. If the therapist makes you feel uncomfortable just tell that. Therapy only works when there's trust. The therapist is the one that should make you feel totally comfortable.
CPTSD,fa0e3gg,t3_e7fqn8,1575753625.0,Totally agree with you. The problem with mental issues is that it's not visible from the outside. If you feel like you need help with your mental issues don't rely on bystanders but search for a professional.
relationships,f691kx6,t3_dqqdqe,1572734008.0,Shoot the fucking dog! Just kidding! Try to talk to your wife again seriously and make sure that's a real issue for you. She shouldn't take this lightly. I hope you can work things out.
therapy,f690hf5,t3_dqqyi1,1572733694.0,The fact alone that you are in therapy for 3 years makes me wonder. As a therapist myself we target to 2 or 3 sessions for a client to be able to pick up his or her life. It's not rocket science. Just find a good therapist.
therapy,f68y370,t3_dqm15o,1572732846.0,"It's like you say: support your hubby as much as you can without letting yourself hurt by your FIL. Don't forget that nobody in this world can hurt you, unless you allow them to... remember that. You are bigger than this abusive FIL. Probably he has a lot of issues himself too, that's why he is now the a-hole that he is. He's probably a victim too.."
therapy,f68krik,t3_dqq32n,1572729421.0,Tell me why you feel this way...
therapy,f68k3ra,t3_dqmls9,1572729310.0,First of all. You are not broken and you don't need any drugs. You need a loving therapist that can kick your bud and give you the wakeup call you desperately need. I would suggest a therapist that can do regression or EMDR. What these guys can do is mind blowing...
ExNoContact,f68iaet,t3_dqhg7b,1572728870.0,Amen!
Anxiety,f68hq1j,t3_dqma8w,1572728732.0,"So true. I've met a very confident person that turned out to be very very insecure... There's no shame in that, just don't judge a person from the outside.... The internal battle can be more than you can ever imagine..."
sex,f68gx3p,t3_dqibmw,1572728558.0,Nothing wrong with that! I wish my wife was more like you!
Borderline,f68fyrt,t3_dqdid1,1572728339.0,You feel bad about yourself but you've found yourself an excuse. So what's the problem?
Stress,f68eekw,t3_dqjg3v,1572727899.0,There is no simple answer. First you should find a good psychotherapist and together start searching for the root of all these problems. Probably they are all connected and created somewhere in your youth. If this is the case then regression therapy can do miracles... I hope you find this information useful.
therapy,f4iq3n8,t3_dknarm,1571607907.0,Of course it's scary but in the end you will come out stronger! And remember: the therapist's mission is to help you!
DeadBedrooms,f4hfb8b,t3_dkhc1w,1571590923.0,You are absolutely right. First fix your relation problems before getting a kid. Getting a kid will only make your problems bigger if you don't work this out.
DeadBedrooms,f4h7tkl,t3_dkgib4,1571588951.0,One word: roleplay!

Stress,f4h37zt,t3_dk993h,1571587586.0,"I think you should try meditation, yoga or mindfulness. They are wonderful for stress relieve."
DeadBedrooms,f43w2xu,t3_dj8ij4,1571345779.0,Don't leave her but talk to her that you are in desperate need of fysical touch and intimacy. I hope she can find the power to set you free and get what you need... Remember that friendship and sex are two different things.
DeadBedrooms,f43ulbh,t3_dj4xkc,1571345288.0,Don't let anybody degrade you. You deserve so much better. I'm sure there's somebody else out there that can fullfill all your needs. Don't stick with this guy. That's all I can say.
CPTSD,f43tjve,t3_djaj9i,1571344936.0,Of course you should. She's the professional one and should be able to deal with it.
hypnosis,f43sgbk,t3_djahgp,1571344695.0,"Of course it is. Clients usually close their eyes anyway,.."
DeadBedrooms,f43rujb,t3_dj3m34,1571344494.0,I don't blame you. Nobody can be in the friendzone for such a long time. We are humans and we need to feel loved. If your husband can't give you that for some reason it's logical you start looking for it in another place. If your husband can not give what you need.. you know what to do..  That doesn't mean you still can't be best friends...
therapy,f43asae,t3_dj4i8x,1571340085.0,"It shouldn't make any difference because all therapistst should be neutral. If you feel more comfortable with a female one, go for it."
therapy,f3yib7v,t3_dis9x3,1571254424.0,A simple trick is to do something completely different when you feel this emotion coming up. Do any of these things: Listening to your favorite happy music. Start singing a song or dance! Or do sport if you can.
Stress,f3yhrjl,t3_dio4oi,1571254196.0,"You're lucky to have your fiance, but it's better so see a good therapist. They can help you too look at your problem from a different angle. I hope you can find a real good one because it can be life changing."
CPTSD,f3yh5d5,t3_dipov5,1571253913.0,Probaly it's some trauma from childhood. I would recommend going to a regression therapist to heal your old pain. I've seen pretty amzing things with this therapy. I'm sure it can work for you too.
hypnosis,f3ygeyn,t3_dioig2,1571253599.0,"Hypnosis can certainly help, even if you are skeptic. Just find yourself a good practitioner."
sex,f3yg6ez,t1_f3vtd5m,1571253498.0,"I learned that child abuse can have a real massive impact. You should advise your wife to get some professional help, in a loving way. Let her know that you love her but that this situation is very difficult for you. You're not an asshole, just human."
therapy,f3yeu1t,t3_digp20,1571252927.0,Sorry that you had this bad experience. This 'therapist' doesn't seem like a real professional one. Do yourself a favor and just find another one.
sex,f3vjtuo,t3_di9ua5,1571177702.0,Just wonder: was your sex life always this bad?
hypnosis,f38boc9,t3_dfxmk8,1570735168.0,These kind of problems should be fixed in max 3 sessions of 1 hour. If I was you I would cancel this appointment and save a lot of money.
therapy,f38ay2l,t3_dfsxem,1570735009.0,She's a very bad therapist. Don't go back to her and find yourself another one. Probably someone on Reddit can help you for free.
CPTSD,f2zzv07,t3_cwb8x4,1570543055.0,Beautiful. Thanks!
therapy,f1ns5yh,t3_da7ker,1569624853.0,"It seems logical that you've built up a wall, but what is your question?"
relationships,f1no66s,t3_da3of6,1569621825.0,Being pregnant does a lot with hormones of women. I guess there's not much you can do besides giving all she wants. The mood swings will pass in a couple of months.
relationships,f1nnlqm,t3_d9xc55,1569621408.0,"You don't have to feel guilty. Crushes happen to everybody. It doesn't mean you don't love Chris. It just means you're human. Just enjoy this little crush for as long as it lasts. It will pass in time, for sure."
PectusExcavatum,f1nlqyo,t3_da6qnt,1569620109.0,Your chest looks realy great!
Stress,f1nl4fc,t3_da2nt4,1569619706.0,Find yourself a good life coach. I guess you will need just 2-3 sessions to get your life back on track. Being 16 and moved to another country can  be hard. There's no shame in that.  Your parents will understand. Try to do meditation every day for peace of mind and finding out what you realy want in life. Best of luck!
therapy,f1ni4gc,t3_d9ysb8,1569617814.0,To me it seems that your therapist needs a therapist of herself. What she does it weird and unprofessional. Don't waste anymore time on this weirdo and find yourself a good one.
