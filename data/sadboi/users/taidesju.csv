Twenty seconds goes by and the elevator kept going until it reached his floor. I was working really late at night in the common area and I heard a steady knocking behind me. They were just three taps on what sounded like wood. The only thing behind me was windows—no door—and I was alone. Many of my friends have said that they had this weird feeling that they’re being watched and put clothes on immediately after showering. One time, I kept trying to fall asleep and felt a presence on my neck.

I had this happen about a month or so ago.

I’m very picky about romantic partners.

Anyways, we haven’t spoken much in the past month and I have only seen him once. To be fair, I’m really busy and I’ve been having a really rough time, but we talk WAY less. Time and distance is usually the best in this situation, I’d say.

Another time, a guy in the same friend group asked me out about this time last year and I shot him down outright (I had known since I met him—accidentally expressed interest when he was drunk). He had bad timing, waiting until the end of the school year to say something and he lived in a different state. One year and a girlfriend later, we’re really good friends and I’m probably closest with him in that friend group.

America has few traditions isolated to this country (at least, when compared to others), so when people say that white people or whitewashed people have no culture, it’s because most of our traditions were probably started about one to two hundred years ago.
