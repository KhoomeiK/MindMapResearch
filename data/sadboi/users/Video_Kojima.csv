It shows to me that there going the way of China and will own 0.1-10% in every major company so it's impossible to avoid them.

They want to own 80% of us because it's quite a cheap investment, £220 million is a good price considering that our turnover alone was £178 million in the 2017/18 season and has room to grow massively commercially. 

Finally this reports shows below the amount of investment they have made recently, £8 billion to them is a small amount of money, and will be able to invest constantly throughout the rest of this decade.

Still I think the reality of the situation is mainly positive,for sure we'd all like this to be completed today rather than wait, but there's noone who's credible that I've seen who thinks it's going to fail.

For anyone suggesting Ashley would pull out, do you really think his going to turn down £300 Million when all his businesses are physically shut, having paid the players wages with no revenue for three months or so now?. He'd lose any remaining credibility he has, and would make any boycott for next season even easier to rally behind.

For the Saudis, they have invested £2.5 billion in other companies within the last two months or so alone, I don't see why £300 million would be an issue now, the UK government are keen for it to go through, and the Premier League know they'd start a huge controversy if there way to see no to this deal.

Maybe we will have to wait a bit longer than expected, but it did seem very close to completion before this final spanner in works took place, infact it wouldn't surprise me if the rest of the test is completed, and the only thing they have left is to prove.

Here, they have seen the guardian report and now are saying Ashley's annoyed as that's now the general mood.

As you said yourself Ashley has no control over this now, so him been pissed off means nothing, and I can't see him pulling out of a £300 million transaction to have to go through lots of court cases to keep us, espically when his main business aren't open and his paid our players three months wages with no revenue coming in."

I have said in the past and will continue to say I wish the takeover was proceeding with just staveley and the reubens involved, but noone has any say over that.

There's a lot of questions to be answered, and I think that people dismiss it as whataboutery is not always fair.

For example a few of my thoughts are.

What about the fact I'm a civil servant and our government sells arms to Saudi Arabia? Does that mean I support Saudi Arabia and are complicit in their dealings.

Or what about the fact I may give money everytime to Saudi Arabia when I fill up at the petrol station?. Why should I give up my team if I  am going to end up giving the money without me knowing anyway.

We believe the tests started on or around the 9th of April, so we may know more by the end of this week or next. Then there's three days to transfer the money across.

I haven't seen one lawyer say they will fail this test, caulkin who is closest to the process seems confident as well.

Regarding the TV piracy, this was known about two weeks ago, hence why I said nothing had changed since then, it's a complicated issue, but one I'd ultimately find hard to prove, it got thrown out of a French court and apparently its no longer in service.

Also, I'll go out on a limb here, I put the chances of mauriss buying us at the same percentage as myself, 0%, there's very little proof of his wealth and whether he has £350 million to spend on us I highly doubt, given the coronavirus situation and it throws way to many red flags for me.

Even if he did have the money, to suggest he'd get everything done before even starting the directors tests in the next few weeks is very unlikely, PIF, Reubens and staveley have huge amounts of money between them and its taken them ages to get here, surely it would take him much longer to get here, especially as he can't even make a bid for the next few weeks.

We seem to whip ourselves into a frenzy when something negative comes out, but yet also ignore the positives as well. Even the negative articles are saying more that the test will get held up rather than them failing it, and I feel confident that's the case as well.

I think if they were going to fail the test, they wouldn't have let it get this far and dragged on this long if they were going to do so, and a lot of articles been written about us are purely because there's nothing else to talk about and the media need to generate clicks for their websites.

As PIF aren't currently involved, it will be a check on Staveley and the reuben brothers, who unless I'm unaware of something will have the funds, and then will also pass the test as there doesn't seem to be anything dodgy about them.

Once that's done then she will sell the shares to the Saudis, and will then have to pass the test themselves, if they fail the test, the club is still owned  by Staveley and the reubens. Staveley owes ashley money which is where the barclays case which she's sueing for £1.5 billion comes in, as that's a failsafe to pay him back, if she doesn't win, then at that stage she could probably sell shares to reuben or source someone else to get involved, given she'd actually own the club it would probably be easier to do at this stage.

I think the chances of the test failing are slim, and I'm an eternal pessimist, PIF may fail, but I doubt that, as I think the PL will want the money they will bring, but if PIF do fail, the ownership has changed hands and Ashley is no longer around.

No, if trump bought us would you hold him responsible for his own actions? Yes, the same applies here.

Whilst I agree with china vs Saudi Arabia, but once again the same logic applies, if a Chinese businessman buys a team it would get a lot less scrutiny than if Xi Jinping went an bought the team themselves.

Finally, your point about the supply chain is a very good one, and one I expect them to fully have themselves embedded in when their project is over by 2030,let's look at sports alone. 

In the space of six months or so, they have bought almeria, hosted Joshua vs Ruiz 2, will start to host an f1 race from 2023, have hosted the spanish super cup and are now set to buy us.

It will get to a stage soon like you say where like China they won't be able to be avoided, and at that point I don't see what me boycotting will do."
NUFC,fnf5gv4,t1_fnf4p6t,1586901755.0,"Whilst I agree we won't here anything for at least the next 48 hours, I think the coronavirus may help it speed along with regards to the PL,  for sure the are sorting out the rest of the season, but that's literally all there doing right now, a huge task though it is surely it may free up some time to look through the new owners more quickly?.

I mean they have agreed to forwarded money to help with cashflow, so they have to sort out the remaining 9 games and the players wage to sort out, although the latter is probably more of a PFA problem. 

I'm hopeful this won't take too long, as I'm not sure how much longer I can actually wait."
NUFC,fnf0mki,t1_fnevfdu,1586899241.0,"I think most of us do, but with the wealth they have their going to have stakes in pretty much everything business wise sooner or later, if you drive then most of the time you fill up with petrol it will be from Saudi Arabia, Uber is part owned by Saudi Arabia, and I'm sure many more things will be soon.

I'd rather them not be involved, but if they are then I will carry on supporting the team, as much as I'd like to think I would be able to stop I know that won't be the case."
soccer,fner1xr,t3_g18mv3,1586894323.0,"Well I'm sure I will see other fans get on our high horse about us getting taken over, yes there humans right record is awful, I'd rather them not be involved in all honesty. but if the premier league are that weak and spineless to allow it to go ahead blame them and not us.

As it currently stands it will be Staveley and the Reubens buying it with the Saudis coming in later, I hope they don't get involved but I really can't see the premier league getting in the way. 

Also not that this makes anything better, but ever caught an uber? that's part owned by saudi arabia, pretty much everytime you put fuel in the car it's saudi arabian oil. it's hard to avoid them in all honesty, if I don't attend they make billions in profit per year and it will hardly make a difference anyway."
NUFC,fne8ncb,t1_fne8791,1586884990.0,"Not long, I doubt they'd want to invest a load of money and still finish 13th, even with investment Bruce isn't capable of improving us, and would eventually get the sack.

Usually with takeovers people want big names in. Which Bruce as a manager certainly isn't that."

NUFC,fndzqeh,t1_fndz8q3,1586880487.0,"As presently constructed I think not, this was my major worry, but they way they have done it should be OK, essentially Staveley and the Reubens will buy it for now, then PIF will come in later, they may reject PIF, but either Amanda staveley keeps control of the club in that case who's currently sueing barclays for £1.5 billion, or the reubens would probably provide more money as there worth £17 billion."
NUFC,fndwizy,t1_fndu940,1586878804.0,Wouldn't he not just wait until its all 100% confirmed before moving over though? Doubt he'd jump the gun and leave before the Premier league approve any deal.
NUFC,fndsla0,t1_fnds6ef,1586876700.0,"Possibly, I think the documents that came out today where filed last week though, so maybe the tests have already started.

NUFC,fnb3nd9,t1_fnb2hqk,1586808643.0,"Thing is, all of this he doesn't like it been leaked to me is a convient excuse for him when it falls through.

When it comes to his other businesses he always plays it out in the media, heck he even said Peter Kenyon was close to buying the club on sky news. Strange action for someone who loves the privacy so much.

We've had more takeover attempts than I care to remember, and all of them have got into the press, ashley has been the only constant throughout all those attempts.

If ashley wants to sell, and these offer a price he feels is fair, then he will sell, I'm still massively unconvinced about him wanting to sell, but unlike previous attempts these definitely have the money, and maybe with coronavirus enforcing a shutdown, it might be the thing to finally get him to fuck off for good.

I just like to dream every now and then of just not having ashley in charge, but I won't be getting carried away like previous times."

I'm a bit worried, three journalists have come out and said documents have been submitted by both sides, one of them been George Caulkin who is probably our most reliable journalist.

Yet Luke Edwards hasn't dismissed it, depsite clearly not understanding how business works, even Craig hope hasn't dismissed it either.

We also know that if the Saudis and the reubens are involved that proof of funds and the actual money won't be an issue either, I know it won't be long, but I'm just on edge waiting to find out whether this is all systems go, or whether our hopes will be dashed once  again. 

I certainly won't be getting as involved as previous times, but let's hope this is it."
NUFC,fmry8lh,t1_fmrxren,1586339932.0,"Who would have thought that in a midst of a global pandemic, that people might want to take their minds off it and discuss a scenario where we can potentially look forward to having new owners.

I think most of us know this is unlikely to happen, but it's nice to think about at a time like this, and frankly I don't see people really getting carried away like they even did in the summer.

If it doesn't happen then fine, we have all been burnt before and know what will happen, but it's not like there's really anything else to really talk about Newcastle wise, I think this is more out of boredom than optimism."
UKPersonalFinance,fml0p8b,t3_fvvtm6,1586175367.0,"There will be those that have loads of money and those that will have none.

I imagine a lot of those that will have money will spend it, they haven't been able to do so for a while and will have a splurge.

Maybe some of people that have money will hold some back on the off chance that they think the virus comes back again, or they think  that the damage to the economy is so bad that they eventually end up losing their job despite having gotten through the initial storm.

I can certainly see more people maybe not wanting to fly for a while and taking more local holidays. Or maybe people may fly, but at lower prices than normal.

Unfortunately there will also be a sector of people on reduced or basically no pay throughout this, and unemployment will certainly grow, a lot of the time it's the poorest that end up spending the most, but if they don't have the money then obviously can't spend it, this will then have an impact on Businesses who then can't stay open leading to further unemployment.

Even if the economy gets back to 90% of what it was pre coronavirus then that will have still a big impact, I think this will be worse than the 2008 crash personally."
UKPersonalFinance,fmkyodc,t3_fvw8hu,1586173502.0,"Worst comes to worst, then say you have gained symptoms and need to self isolate and can't work for a short period and get a break that way, I certainly wouldn't quit your job at this moment in time."
NUFC,fmkqr1q,t3_fvvhzi,1586164931.0,"Let's say the takeover doesn't go ahead, how do we think Mike ashley will come out of this whole situation?.

The longer the economy is shut, the more people will lose jobs and then not spend money in his stores, do we think a couple of his businesses may go bust as a result of this?. Or could he go on a spending spree of buying other businesses whilst there cheap?. 

I mean house of fraser was struggling a bit pre coronavirus, GAME I reckon might struggle due to people just buying digital copies of games they may have bought in his stores at the mean time.

Whilst I doubt it would happen, if our season gets cancelled like in Belgium, then that's another loss of revenue as well.

He always seems to come out the other side, but I do wonder how much money he will lose out of all this and what impact that will have on us."
NUFC,fmcl9ic,t3_fuafwh,1585947837.0,"I think FFP would have a huge impact, although I suppose they may be happy to pay the fine.

First thing I would do is get a new manager, I'd love poch or allegri but I doubt either would join even with the huge  investment, we're too far from Europe and both can easily get jobs at clubs at the top of the game which we're a long long way from. 

I'd imagine we would be looking at managers more of the level of emery, valverde and so on.

I would say we would need a right back and a striker, from the English leagues I think I'd take Aarons from Norwich at right back, and batshuayi upfront.

It would take years to break into the top six, and I'd rather have players who would want to be here and progress then take on older players who would say us a payday if we did get taken over."

What we do have is the chief correspondent of the Times and telegraph stating that papers have been submitted from both sides, and George claiming its further down the line than ever before.

If George was to confirm tommorow that papers have been submitted then that would be a huge step forward from any previous discussions we have had.

Due to the situation with coronavirus football won't be played for a while, and even when it does resume we're safe anyway, Mike ashleys fraser group is taken a massive hit, and hopefully the chance to get a huge wad of money at a time of massive uncertainty may convince him to fuck off.

Who the fuck knows with ashley though."
