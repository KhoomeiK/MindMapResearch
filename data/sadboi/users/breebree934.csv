A LOT of you probably don't know that radon gas is the second leading cause of lung cancer in the U.S. to date! It's colorless, odorless, and tasteless and enters in through your home through soil and well water. ANY home can have radon and the only way to reduce it is by installing a mitigation system in your home (sub-slab depressurization system for those who want to look more into it). 

&#x200B;

Testing your home for radon is relatively quick, cheap, and easy though. You can pick up a charcoal activated testing canister at any local home renovation store (Home Depot, Lowes, etc.) for about $20-$30 US. The only reason people don't test is just because at this point there isn't a whole lot of knowledge about it from the general public. You'll only hear about it usually when it's already too late!"
