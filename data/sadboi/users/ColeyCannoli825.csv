Let someone have space to communicate without immediately responding with how they should be different, invalidating their current feelings/reality, or comparing them to others. And don't just respond with ways to ""fix it"". Just let them communicate/vent, acknowledge their feelings, and move on. Unless they are asking for your help all you need to do is hear them. You can reply with ""I'm sorry you're having a hard time"", it is usually all that is required/desired. Don't assume they want your advice/help, ask them. You'd be surprised how many people just want to be heard, or already know their options because a human being can be self-aware while still experiencing distressing emotions.

Depression and anxiety stuff has left me disabled and agoraphobic, still living with my mother (a source of trauma) because I can't afford to live in my own place. She is ill and I am terrified of the future, of being homeless and mentally ill, totally inexperienced in life. I have no family- no one to know if I live or die. If I grow old I'll be completely alone, no one to care if I fall, get sick, have dementia (which runs in my family) etc. I hardly communicate with anyone anymore, I haven't seen a friend in years. 

I do not want to be alive. I do not enjoy living. Being alive terrifies me, makes me feel trapped and alone with only worse to come. 

What I DO like? Animals. Before getting too ill I was going to college for veterinary technology. I've wanted to take care of animals since I was 4/5 years old. My pets are the only reason I'm here.

With all the addiction, mental health, sex/relationship, and physical illness subreddits... How can you deny that the internet and reddit is already very personal? People who are going through illness/terminal illness post. Suicidal individuals post. People post nudes with their faces and tats showing, leaving them identifiable. People make private accounts in order to share their most embarrassing or terrifying experiences. So what makes this different?

We all cope differently, so I understand why some people would prefer to keep it to themselves. But some people cope by sharing. And sometimes, sharing with strangers can help more than sharing with someone you know or is experiencing it as well. 

Sometimes people post pictures of loved ones on their proverbial or literal death bed, but with the happy ending of making a recovery. But not all things have happy endings, and i think it's important to hold a place for that too. 

Also, it very much helps normalize sharing one's feelings and experiences. There are people everywhere who have loved ones dying, and would benefit from being able to share during such a difficult time. I think sharing experiences surrounding very difficult things helps others feel less alone. 

Just my 2cents."

cats,fbz9y69,t1_fbz3w6b,1577239734.0,"Dry food in general is better avoided. Having a wet food diet will always provide more moisture, and beneficial calories as opposed to empty calories. Multiple vets of mine have likened dry food as the ""potato chips"" of cat food. 

My boy has always struggled with dehydration, he is a cat that just doesn't drink much water. Which is damgerous for males in that it can cause urine crystals, blockage, and kidney failure at it's most severe. If it was up to him he would only eat dry food, which also leaves cats prone to urinary health problems and diabetes. 

The key was providing a mostly wet food diet (it was an adjustment for him, but he made it through and now is happy as can be). Also, adding some warm water to your cat's wet food (or even to their dry food) is great for encouraging more hydration. Sometimes cats just view water as boring, so adding flavor to it can help lots. When my boy cat had his cancer surgery this year it was even harder to get him to stay hydrated during recovery. I ended up adding a little bit of the water from canned tuna into his water, and he would lap it right up."

SuicideWatch,fbz4bmw,t3_eeyc3w,1577234670.0,"I just want to say... That cat you think doesn't give a shit about you? Totally does. Cats get a bad rep because their personalities and quirks and vary so widely. And they aren't pack animals that look for praise. But you take care of and live with that cat every day. You are a focal point in its existence. If it suddenly didn't have you and the safe environment you provide it wpyld definitely have a reaction. I've had cats that don't want to be touched or are even aggressice at times, and they still definitely bond with you in the ways they are capable of. 

This year is my worse. Wont get into it. But i took in a kitten that was being neglected by the ""rescue"" I got it from. Terribly sick, covered in ringworm (which I caught from her). She is terrified of people and will run from you. I was used to my cat that died earlier this year suddenly from cancer who, while fear-aggressive, was very intensely bonded to me. I would break down entirely when I would go to show this kitten affection and she would run from me like i was a monster. I really believed she just feared and didnt like me. 

I went out of my apartment for the first time in 3 months yesterday for about 6 hours. When I got home... She was frozen under the bed and had refused to use the bathroom or eat the whole day. Only now, the next day, about 7pm...did I finally get her to eat. She was effected by my absence so much more than I had ever imagined. 


They feel a lot more than we may think. Both your pets love you, and need you. I don't say that to pressure you or anything like that. I say it as a reminder that, when we're suicidal and in a really bad place, we don't always see how others value us. But your pets do indeed love you. While you might be worried of how you influence your dog... There are people who wouldn't even consider the emotional wellbeing of their dog to the extent you have. You are their safe person, and I guarantee they would prefer you over anyone else. 

Humans might be able to lie. But, IMO, animals are innately genuine to their nature, incapable of really lying. Some animals, when their humans are stressed, insist on getting closer. Others respond by giving more space. Either way... You are their family. You have one another. That is something beautiful, and something to try and hold on to. 

I'm someone who is literally only alive because of my 2 cats. My love and sense of responsibility to them is the only thing that has stopped me from completing multiple attempts this year. I would encourage anyone to use this in a way to protect yourself from urges. When you can't life for yourself, you can try to live for the good you can provide to your pets. 

It's different for everyone. And gosh knows I understand how painful it can be. I really hope you manage to fight those impulses, and can feel a reason to stay. Even of that reason is to fill up their food bowls and make them comfortable/happy. <3

PublicFreakout,fbse96l,t1_fbs274l,1577054047.0,"One thing to consider is, it's never known if a rapist will actually get the punishment/jail time they deserve. Rapists get away all the time, even when brought to court. Perhaps the father was also thinking of that possibility. Perhaps he was thinking ""I can't allow this man to exist and possibly do this to other children""... I mean, the guy was a kids karate instructor. Lord knows how many kids he was inappropriate with, or how many more could have been violated had things gone differently. 

For me personally, I can't wrap my head around pedophiles going to jail. They get shelter, food, enrichment (to a degree)... The people in jail have more than the average homeless person. They even have health care, which good people can't even get. I know the death penalty is controversial, but there are situations (like pedophiles) where something more than jail time is deserved. You've traumatized and changed someone for the rest of their lives, to live with that pain... You shouldnt get antibiotics when sick, protected from possible jailmate attacks, get 3 meals a day... You should have to suffer the say that child did and will continue to do. You should feel the pain of sickness and hunger.

They are amazing for what they are and how great they tie into the original books. The only difference you see is in how much the characters actually notice as they grow older. Life wasn't just fun and whimsy when they were younger, they just didn't grasp it yet because they were kids. Also, as the books came out and were successful JKR was given more freedom - she didn't have to keep editing and ""selling"" a book to publishers. So more creative freedom/less censorship meant she could delve into topics like racism and corrupt governments etc. more so compared to the first few books. You read The Philosopher's Stone and it is very different from Deathly Hallows because 1) the characters have grown up and know more 2) JKR could get into more controversial subjects.

And then proceeded to talk loudly about it for the next half hour. 

It was so embarrassing. I was trying so hard to socialize. I literally have barely left my apartment the last 2-3 years, and have cut off everyone i used to know *because* I'm ashamed. I have put on *a lot* of weight over the last few years because of a big decline in my mental health, about 80lbs. It really fell apart after I was drugged and raped by multiple people a few years ago (I have trauma history so that opened all kibds of stuff again). Then finding out *on my birthday* my supposed S.O. I thought I could trust cheated on me with 2 other girls. 

Everything feels just too dangerous. Being seen, being outside in open space, talking to anyone in any format (I can't even text or answer IG comments). With all this shit... Even still, I think of that comment every day. 

People really don't seem to understand how a few of the wrong words can effect someone so much. I'm so sorry you had that experience.

aww,fav9d7x,t1_fav49ym,1576356806.0,"Tip: those outdoor greenhouse tents work really well for sheltering them from elements, keeping their food in, and keeping heat in. And can allow enough room for them all to fit if they need to. Also, make sure to put something heated under their food and water, so it doesn't freeze. 

And, as you already know, spay and neuter. Spay and neuter clinics are much less expensive than taking them to a normal vet. Also, if you habe SPCA spay/neuter vans that show up in the neighborhood that is really cost effective. And they can do basic vaccinations I believe. Seniors rarely get enough SSI to spare in my experience, so I figured I'd just add that in (especially if all the food and stuff is already coming out of pocket). 

I also suggest making little shelves or stacking things by your fences to make it easier to climb. This will make sure they don't get injured from high jumps, and allows safer/faster escape in case another aninals spooks them etc. 

Honestly I'm so happy he has these kitties. Aninals and taking care of something can add so much to your life. It gives you a sense of purpose. I help take care of two kitties on my block with another neighbor, and it warms my heart. I also imagine it gives all of you something to bond over. Good luck!"

AmItheAsshole,faoi4gx,t3_ea4hnu,1576264861.0,"*How* you say something is really important when discussing something upsetting or triggering to someone dealing with anxiety. Telling her ""it's ridiculous"" can sound/feel like you're blaming or judging her, or that you are invalidating her feelings or her side of things. 

I would suggest having another, calmer, talk about it. Remember to ask her how she feels about the issue and how she feels about therapy, don't just tell her what she needs to do. Believe me, *she knows* It keeps her from living her life and being happy. People with anxiety are almost always thinking and feeling how much it rules their lives. It's like telling a fat person fat... They know already! Stress that you care about her happiness and being able to healthily navigate life and fulfill her goals. Don't just make it about how it effects and inconveniences you, while also being able to articulate how it inhibits you both from experiencing things together. Offer to take her to therapy, wait for her in the waiting room so she has reassurance, at least at first. You can even see about having a joint session in the beginning to talk about ways you can support one another and communicate better when problems arise. 

I struggle with agoraphobia and social anxiety disorder, and when partners have gotten mad at me about it I tend to close off and get upset, feeling even worse about the anxiety I have. No one is more acutely aware of how shitty it is than I am, I'm the one experiencing it ruining my life. But when partners have made it about me and my experience I am more open and proactive, more willing to work in therapy, and I feel safer in my relationship. I feel like I can express things as they are happening, as opposed to only when something has already gone wrong. I/we can plan ahead, negotiate how to approach things together. My ex and I even had cues/codes for when we were in situations where we couldn't discuss it. For example, we had a certain hand squeeze when we were around others and I needed a break. But you can't plan those things out when emotional. You do that work together when home, in a calm state, to prepare ahead of time.

This is just what I've experienced myself, in therapy and/or within relationships. Everyone is different. But it sounds similar to things I've been through."

holdmycatnip,f9i2vbp,t1_f9h3ywm,1575326964.0,"Wow I didn't expect anyone to read my ramble. Honestly the most frustrating thing was my experience with the rescue I adopted her from. They clearly didn't properly care for her, adopted her out before 8 weeks and without being fixed (which IMO is the opposite of what rescue work encourages, spay and neuter is one of the largest goals and I haven't heard of other certified rescues ever adopting unfixed cats). They lied about having taken her to the vet, the woman gave her dewormer at home but never took her to a vet...so the contract I signed was BS. Yet I know someone else who had a good experience with the rescue multiple times, and I've seen them get vet help for other cats on their IG. I wanted to out them at first I was so angry because she was so sick and it was heartbreaking. But then I felt bad because realistically she is still helping get cats off the street and into homes, she's actively trying to help. But the lying about vetting, and leaving a kitten in danger of being let out unfixed by future owners... It wracks my brain. In the end I decided to let my vet know which rescue it was, in case anyone else they treated happened come from there...so at least the vets know not to take the word of possibly false prior care to adoption (it's a neighborhood rescue). That way kitties dont have any medical issues go amiss. Because my kitten's ringworm wasn't immediately known by me obviously until my whole house caught it lol. 

In the end I'm just glad I was able to get her healthy and happy. I've only ever had cats I rescued from the street myself, I've never adopted from a shelter/rescue before. So I guess I can say it was a learning experience and I will be much more discerning in the future about the validity of contracts etc. While i don't regret a single penny spent on her the fact is, between her care and the huge cancer surgery of my other cat I've had to go without my own medical treatment. A sacrifice I'm more than happy to make, but it still kinda really sucks when I have pain. I took out credit for them, but I have good credit. This is why it is so important to be honest with adopters... Many other people would not or simply could not afford such sacrifices. Oy!"
holdmycatnip,f96n6ab,t3_e3ttjo,1575148126.0,"My rescue kitten does this with a particular fuzzy toy (who we call ""Mama hedgehog""). She was defibitely separated/weaned too soon. She and her 2 siblings were found huddling next to the body of their dead mom. The 2 sibbling were adooted off together (while still too young), and she was solitary in a kennel until I saw her. She was under-aged too, and very sick and covered in ringworm - the rescue falsified vet records and was just super sketchy. When I confonted them they just kept saying ""well then give her back""... Yeah no way. What if they ""adopted"" her out to someone who couldnt afford all her medical expenses, or just didn't even bother with vets or bother to get her fixed? What if they didnt want to deal with the constant diarrhea, or exposure to ringworm, and tossed her out or let her fade? Aside the the BS $120 adoption fee, between her being awfully sick and months of ringworm treatment (since that was pre-existing to the pet insurance I also pay) I've spent about 2k on her. She's terrified of people and not cuddly, but loves to play with toys and eat a lot, and she's bonded with me in her own way. Not the kind of kitten people typically ""want"" when looking for a pet. But she is totally 1000% worth it. She's happy and has a big senior brofur who tolerates her antics lol. I know she was meant to be mine, and she needed someone who could help her medically/financially and accept her as she is. But I melt and feel so sad for her when she goes into the desperate bliss of trying to knead and nurse. She'll come cry to me to get ""in position"" in bed with her while she nurses her toy.

I sometimes find that poor food/health habits are hard for people to address/change for themselves... Whether because they've become resigned or used to it, or struggle with low self-esteem which can feed unhealthy habits like eating for comfort. But helping a loved one is sometimes easier. Especially if it is a significant other and you utilize new habits as times to bond. So she feels included with you and have that positive experience that isn't just about weight/looks with can cause anxiety. 

I've struggled with disordered eating and binge eating my whole life. I've experienced having a partner try to help but make it worse by doing things like mention/focus on weight loss. He would try to correct me in stores or when we were out to eat. Which would lead me to feel guilty and hate on myself for not ""being better"", and then I wouldnt eat around him at all and instead binged in private because I've not eaten all day. Whereas I've also had partners that encourage healthier options without pointing out weight/calories/etc. For example, when out to eat.. rather than say ""you shouldn't have fries, they aren't good for you, a salad will be less calories""... You can phrase it in a more neutral/postive way like ""oh these green beans sound really good but I'm not sure I want the whole order myself, can we split some veggies?""... Even if she has fries, she will also then eat some greens with you. Or even just asking if you guys can share sweet potato fries instead, that's still a healthier option that doesn't feel like you're missing out on what you want. When you're addicted to sugar and fast food your taste buds and body chemistry literally change. You almost need to retrain your taste buds really. The more she tastes these things the more she'll be likely to consider it because it is now familiar mentally and physically. All us human animals default to what's familiar because instincts. 

Asking to go on weekend walks/hikes together can be really nice and romantic too. And you can focus on wanting to have more energy and less headaches rather than ""we need to exercise and lose weight"". 

That was long-winded... Sorry. But yeah, that's been my experience with myself and others in my life who have struggled with diet/health both physically and mentally."

depression,f834dhf,t1_f81ha7z,1574204106.0,"I have a large 11 year old boy cat that went through a very hard surgery this year after being diagnosed with cancer. At the same time I lost my 11/12 yo female black cat, who I had a very special relationship with, died somewhat suddenly. She started coughing and took her to the vet. An x-ray showed her body full of cancer, everywhere. She had been to the vet plenty, had dental, and checked out in great body condition. She just never had cause for body xrays... She died about 9 days later. It was and is devastating.
I also have a 7.5 month old female kitten that was very sick when we . I took her in just a month later. I had been very weary of ever having another cat again. I just wanted to take care of my boy cat, who was going through cancer surgery and treatment, and try to hang on for that. But on Easter my mom and I went to a nearby pretty store so I could get him a present for coming home from surgery. Apparently they were having an adoption event. My mom walked in, saw this little kitten, and fell in love. It looked just like a cat she had before having me. She was terrified of people, cold and single in a cage, still blue eyes, and desperately crying and seeking the comfort of the cats around her *just* out of reach. My mom asked if we could adopt her with stars in her eyes. I could tell something was off. The kitten shouldnt have been in those conditions or that young. The combination of circumstances led me to decide that yes, this kitten was meant to come home with us. She ended up being very sick, the rescue having lied and never actually taken her to a vet. Just gave some over the counter dewormer. The kitten was COVERED in ringworm (which I and my boy cat caught and had to be treated for) since the first vet kept insisting the scabs were mite bites or allergies... Which I didnt trust at all. I took her to a different vet right after that, and she was diagnosed and treated correctly. She also had a bad URI and eye infection, and was vomiting and constantly leaked diarrhea. She had no worms ironically, but she did have an allergy to chicken of all things. Most kitten food is chicken based so we went through a lot of different things before we found the right food for her. She is clearly a somewhat feral kitten. She does not trust humans, and will only skittishly come around for food. She does love to play and can be enticed out if it's quiet. She trusts me most because I handled her - she'll meow at me when she wants to play, will sleep in me bed, and will let me get in some booty scritches for a few seconds at a time. Turns out she's terrified of my mom, and since she didn't handle her through all the illness stuff the kitten she simply never formed a connection in those important earlier weeks. My mom was very sad at first, but still loves her and appreciates her for her own unique personality. So now she is my kitten, and I really struggled at first. All the illness going on between her and my cancer boy, and the intense grief I was going through all through it... I was breaking down. But as I saw her get healthier, and I saw my boy being resilient and stabilize as he healed from surgery, it was worth it. 

Im at the lowest point of my life. Home-bound, completely cut off from everyone, gained 70 pounds, losing hair, and my already existing physical health problems getting worse but too terrified to go to the doctor because outside and talking to a person. I kinda don't exist anymore already. I only exist in my being able to take care of the cats and carry things up and down the stairs for my mother/help with her mobility at home. I live with the person who abused and neglected me, and enabled my addictions/habits as a way to manipulate, my whole life. Because I would otherwise ve homeless. It is a pathetic existence, and I feel like a ghost of a person that is already dead. But as pathetic as it is, it provides just enough guilt to keep me here for now. Also, the seizures from my last attempt last year were very scary, and I'm terrified of failing again and having to experience all the pain after.

Whereas all my real unsafe situations or abuse happened in what I thought were safe spaces with safe people (go figure right?). It feels so cruelly ironic.

These days I try to think in terms of my pets. They wouldn't understand the circumstances no matter what they were. They would just know that their safe person is gone. When I think in terms of humans I always find a reason why they would be happier without me, or adjust and move on. But animals... Even when they are great with other people, they know that their person is gone. While I trust other humans to not be phased by my absence, I almost always feel too guilty at the thought of confusing/saddening my animals.
