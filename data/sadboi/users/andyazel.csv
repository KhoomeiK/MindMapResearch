ehlersdanlos,fqmc53e,t3_gjlmmh,1589475009.0,"Same. My entire life I've almost wished to have full blown cancer or something, because then at least I'd be taken seriously by anyone. Because I have chronic, low grade symptoms no one really cares."
rupaulsdragrace,fqmbtcv,t1_fqm8aij,1589474856.0,Seems to be a very vague tudor theme. Almost like All Stars 2.

gfur,fqko6pa,t3_gj5pc5,1589431822.0,"This is really nice looking, but looking at their other work I’m pretty sure they’re using 3D modeling to get the impossibly detailed fur. As an artist, I don’t feel so bad now lol."
PublicFreakout,fqhzpmw,t1_fqh73e0,1589387365.0,Few spoons short of a flatwear set.
snes,fqfrpe0,t1_fqdugn7,1589330387.0,I actually agree with you. But I find filters too distracting. I’d rather play on a crt tv or a small portable screen where it’s difficult to notice the pixel edges anyway.
snes,fqfrds8,t1_fqeo6o1,1589330210.0,These things aren’t exactly cheap though.
snes,fqds8qo,t1_fqdgdk2,1589295691.0,The new black and gold model's D-pad is pretty bad. I can not fathom playing something like street fighter with it. I'm hoping it will loosen up with some use.
snes,fqdrzde,t1_fqcnnrh,1589295560.0,Interesting! Thanks for clarifying. It's been surprising to find out emulating it on my laptop with snes9x and then outputting to my crt with a hdmi to av converter actually looks better than just hooking the supaboy to my tv. I did not expect that.
snes,fqdrffk,t1_fqdcpww,1589295285.0,I think the black and gold version came out last year. i've been watching reviews of that.
ehlersdanlos,fq198cn,t3_ggfmy4,1589043456.0,I'm flattered and take is as a compliment. \*shrug\*

DeadOrAlive,fpd6lzv,t1_fpd4ubu,1588520910.0,"Yeah Kasumi and Ayane have sort of ""aged out"" I guess. But Marie Rose and Honoka (and Nico too, let's be real) basically look 14, despite officially being ""18"" or whatever."
DeadOrAlive,fpd64uu,t1_fpcjymc,1588520630.0,I could deal with Marie Rose as a one-off lolita character. Now it's a running theme.
DeadOrAlive,fpd5z8e,t1_fpc489g,1588520538.0,"I agree with you. ""Airhead"" is her personality, and she is kind of difficult to use. And reusing move sets is prevalent in the genre. DOA did a decent job of covering it up before Honoka though. It didn't help that she was introduced with zero context."
DeadOrAlive,fpc21he,t1_fpc0m0x,1588485111.0,"She’s the ultimate sell out character. A man named Tomonobu Itagaki directed DOA 1-4.  And even though he was allegedly a creep, he had standards and loved his characters and their portrayals very much. Honoka was introduced at the end of DOA 5 and is an impossibly young looking, naive girl with the largest breasts in the game, with a move set ripped off entirely from the rest of the cast. It’s lazy and pandering. Before Honoka there was at least an attempt at diversity. Now we get increasingly younger and more generic characters."
DeadOrAlive,fpc01p7,t3_gcipxp,1588483403.0,I think she represents everything wrong with the series after DOA 4 but 90% of the people online play Honoka so I guess I’m in the minority.

starocean,fozj8jq,t1_fozcijy,1588191580.0,It's definitely on my list. Tales games have turned me off in the past though because the stories and characters are so irritating.
starocean,foz8c0c,t1_foz4s5b,1588186368.0,"I looked into doing this. I've modded my PS Classic with great results. But because Star Ocean has a patched translation, it's more complex, involving Hakchi, Retroarch and something called SFROM Tool. And there's no single coherent instructions anywhere. It's fragmented all over the internet. I don't have the patience or stamina to figure that out right now lol."

Lenovo,for6afw,t3_f9tlpa,1588006898.0,I just got one. I need someone to explain to me why everyone seems to love this thing. I'm frustrated with it. The case feels cheap and is prone to finger print smudges. The screen has almost two inches of unutilized space. The speakers are ON THE BOTTOM of the laptop so the sound is very muffled. The battery life is 4 hours MAX. And the screen has a lot of resistance with the pen causing an unpleasant scraping sensation. It also does that wavy diagonal line thing when you draw.

illnessfakers,fmxdq2n,t1_fmvjrrx,1586463075.0,"EDS is a whole spectrum that doctors are still coming to understand. It's an ""invisible"" illness so i guess it's pretty easy for these girls to jump on the sympathy bandwagon. I have EDS. But it only presents for me as stretchy skin, flexible joints, low blood pressure, and I don't absorb nutrients or hydration well. (But I've yet to need a feeding tube, thank god.)"

technology,fm33ta4,t3_fsg2m2,1585712155.0,I just bought a used Mini Cooper and intentionally bought an older model without a touchscreen. Not only is it more aesthetically pleasing but I hate mashing my fingers against an unresponsive screen to get simple tasks done.

startrek,flmaryo,t1_flm5j8c,1585278695.0,"This seems like the most logical and interesting answer, but someone straight up asked Michael Chabon on instagram if this was the case and he said ""If so, it's news to me"". He hasn't straight up lied before on his instagram Q&A, so I dunno. Maybe it's a huge misdirect like Control being so similar to the Borg on Discovery."

AccidentalRenaissance,fl655y3,t3_fmqq67,1584854796.0,Wow this looks like concept art.
rupaulsdragrace,fl5lqxs,t3_fme6w9,1584839774.0,Well that was some grade A bullshit.
AccidentalRenaissance,fl48ffr,t1_fl3ebd4,1584808182.0,Oh yes I remember all that lense flare in classic renaissance art.
DeadOrAlive,fl2zq8d,t3_fitois,1584764326.0,I agree. I like playing her but her throws and counters need more gravity and weight behind them. It’s all kind of floaty.
AccidentalRenaissance,fl2l5yt,t3_fm15fe,1584753648.0,How is this getting so many upvotes? There’s literally nothing renaissance about it.
FL_Studio,fl201nf,t3_flxmts,1584739933.0,"Wow that is very video gamey, in a good way. Reminds me old sega stuff. Honestly maybe you should consider doing game soundtracks lol. My two cents is... your sounds are very ""cute"" and retro. Not particularly modern or dynamic."
PSO2,fl1z7sg,t1_fl1sgbb,1584739419.0,I was expecting the difficulty to be similar to the original PSO.
startrek,fl0ytog,t3_fl52sp,1584718620.0,"This is feeling like Discovery Season 2's finale all over again. A sentimental, weirdly paced part 1 followed by a hectic, massive cgi space battle in part 2."
startrek,fl0ye8k,t1_fl0a2pj,1584718366.0,"Yeah! It seemed like they were giving room for commercial breaks. My stream even stopped a handful of times while a ""loading"" animation appeared for a few seconds. So strange."
startrek,fkzynk7,t1_fkzwhzi,1584684716.0,I noticed the weird cuts too. When the synth girl let narek free from the prison the editing was super weird and awkward.
PSO2,fkzxzil,t3_fkg0pv,1584684023.0,"So umm.. does it ever get fun? Right now the game feels simultaneously really easy and really complex. Like there’s a a huge list of tasks to check off and it throws items at you like confetti, but it doesn’t feel good to play. I just mash attack and everything dies. It’s almost like dynasty warriors or something lol."
PSO2,fkzxfnp,t3_flme12,1584683479.0,Thank you! A million different options and a huge list of tasks is not fun for me. I haven’t been this overwhelmed by a game in a while.
PSO2,fkzx9e3,t1_fkzg842,1584683308.0,Same. It’s a lot of stuff. But the fun isn’t there. There’s no challenge. Just complexity. I don’t know why modern gamers just like clicking on things and watching numbers go up while rewards fly out in every direction.

LoveIsBlindOnNetflix,fklelym,t3_fim0mj,1584304657.0,The most dramatic change was after she said no at the alter. Like she was finally free and could be herself. It was agony watching and listening to her all season long.
rupaulsdragrace,fkkdeyy,t3_fivh3c,1584281247.0,What kind of romper room fuckery
rupaulsdragrace,fkjkm2o,t1_fkiaqmj,1584248889.0,Exactly. Thank you for wording it so well. I think it’s insulting that they re-edited it. I’d like to believe we’re an intelligent audience who understands nuance and life isn’t black and white. Good artists do bad things.
rupaulsdragrace,fkjkfed,t1_fkivqbn,1584248716.0,"Same. It was so bland and the removal of sherry’s screen time was so obvious and distracting. I was really into this season but now it feels like the balance has been thrown off. 

What she did was awful and unforgivable but I’m a grown ass man who can think and judge for myself. I don’t need editing to tell me how I’m supposed to feel about someone. Maybe I’m in the minority."
rupaulsdragrace,fkjjdop,t3_fihkmv,1584247745.0,That challenge was so bad and embarrassing oh my god.
rupaulsdragrace,fkjjb8d,t1_fkj8dxh,1584247685.0,They altered the edit to give less time to sherry pie. It’s fairly obvious. She got absolute minimal screen time.
rupaulsdragrace,fkiq9zc,t3_filqfd,1584226067.0,Unpopular opinion but this sort of retro active editing makes me feel icky and manipulated.
