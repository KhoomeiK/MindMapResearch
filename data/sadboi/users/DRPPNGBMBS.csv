That in regard to how other problems of smaller magnitude are handled by Chinese government makes me wonder what the exact point of the comparison in the article is?

 Of course it's a tragedy but the CCCP is at least extremely questionable in their approach towards the media (they're complete control freaks and known for downplaying any negative information). 

So if the writer wants to objectively compare 2 situations, he should review all  the contributing factors to the current public response too as well as assessing the swine flu situation better (**mexico??????**), and make a comprehensive assessment instead of just writing a piece of mind shitty fluff piece."

She regularly lies about work related stuff that never happens, trying to make other co-workers look bad, and I am sure she told her fair deal about me too.

Yes, I could confront her but the bit of money I can get before Christmas and after is direly needed. She is acting like she has the power to fire everyone on the spot, while saying co-worker B will get fired to coworker A, and telling co-worker A will get fired to co-worker B, you get the gist. It's a shitshow that makes me anxious and extremely stressed.


Jobs are really scarce around Christmas, I already applied to everything possible in the region (now I do have a new job), also my portfolio needs work since I worked insane hours the last few years. (All projects done are studios property) Also I can survive Christmas, I already got a new job now but I have my principles too. 

It's what management thinks we should do with our time while there's no actual work to do. So I am pissed off because clearly booting us in a bad time is easy but working on our own survival is not allowed? Again it's the principles behind the situation.


Mum is a friend of her husband and involved for work on the new office. Boss was talking shit about everyone to her the whole week. My mum knows everything about the situation. It's too much for her dealing with the toxic gossips of  a two-faced snake bitch boss.
