So this card is also known as death. I want you to be aware of the fact that this does not mean that anybody or anything is going to die; rather, it‚Äôs more about spiritually releasing past trauma, emotions and pent up energy. Recognise that now is the time to move on from old ideas which limit your ability to evolve to your furthest potential. Acknowledgement of the end of this phase (and the beginning of a new one) can bring some sadness or a sense of relief, either way it‚Äôs time to leave that which you‚Äôve outgrown. Also do keep in mind that this can signify the need to move past things in the material world, in order to progress spiritually. This card suggests inevitable positive changes are on the way. It‚Äôs imperative to face your fears ‚Äî be ready and put what has already happened in the past and let it stay in the past. Some things are best left alone and serve only as a lesson / guidance to carry on going ahead. Only look forward. Overall this is a positive card; you are in a stage of transitioning. Out with the old, and in with the new. Consider this a fresh start with the knowledge and wisdom which has come from your life journey, thus far."

This card is the epitome of feminine energy. The answer is embedded within your feelings and emotions. This card reminds you that you don‚Äôt need to race into action ‚Äî i.e. determining your sexuality. This card often has sexual overtones ‚Äî how fitting. The priestess can also suggest being secretive about ones sexuality; don‚Äôt be afraid to reach out to other people in the lgbt community. Many people are in the same boat, of all ages. A key message I keep getting is to have patience. This is certainly one of those things that you will come to learn overtime. Don‚Äôt rush. Lesbian, bisexual, or straight - the label doesn‚Äôt dictate what choices you make. Lastly, I feel that with more experience with women, sexually, which I am quite confident will come down the line, you‚Äôll have a better understanding of your sexuality. The HP is sometimes considered a virginal card. So experience is yet to happen (or perhaps, more than what has happened, if anything); but as I said, it‚Äôs not a race. We can go into more detail over pm, if you wish."

This can be about holding onto things longer than  is healthy, and realistic ‚Äî may it be a person, money or a situation. Fear energy comes up; perhaps you have a fear of rejection - this is fuzzy to me. 
I don‚Äôt feel there has been a significant bond between you both in the past; at least, not on their part. 
Your feelings are more evolved here, for sure. If you‚Äôve been obsessing over ‚Äújs‚Äù take a breather. 
Another side of this coin, could be that you‚Äôve focused so much on this person, but have done nothing about it ‚Äî relationships don‚Äôt fall out from the sky. Take steps.... though, having said that, find other areas in your life to focus on. That doesn‚Äôt mean you need to forget about this person. This was not an easy reading. Fuzziest I have felt in a while during a reading. If you generally keep things to yourself, and refrain from revealing, that can be why."

I feel like you want things to be different, but you have no idea to achieve that. Part of this comes from fear of the unknown. Are you holding yourself back because of this? 
When you get knocked down, it‚Äôs easy to fall into a pit of despair, ‚Äúlocked‚Äù in a pattern of going nowhere other than where you‚Äôve been before, both figuratively and literally. Accept that setbacks *do* happen. You shouldn‚Äôt let the fear of failure to stop you from moving forwards. 
Generally, this card suggests to me that you feel stuck. And this too, could harbour the feelings of uncertainty you have for the future. Perhaps that is also why it was difficult to identify a key area you needed insight on. Be the unicorn shown on the card, go forward. You have people behind you, rooting for you. So you aren‚Äôt alone in what I feel, is overwhelming you. You don‚Äôt always need a clear destination to start your journey. The main thing here, is to get moving."

I rang my grandmother to refresh my memory. I was mistaken about his time in prison; he actually served less than a year. The murders happened at the beginning of 1979, in a port city, Iran.

There is a bit more to the story which I forgot..

Whilst he was in prison, he sent a man to pick up my mother and aunt (10 y old and 5 y) from their playgroup. Thankfully the person in-charge phoned my grandparents before giving them to the man. Days later, they packed as much as they could and fled the country, fearing he wanted to ""sort out"" their children, too. Kind of unrelated, but on their journey to England (which they already had a business visa for), all of their belongings were stolen at the airport during questioning. 

Toward the end of 79, when the Islamic Revolution happened, he and some other prisoners broke out of prison. He travelled to the capital where he enlisted as a revolutionary guard. He started a family, had kids etc.

12 years ago, he ""delivered"" a message through distant relatives; that he's always waiting for the day she (great aunt) returns."

**In 1978/9**, my great aunt got a divorce (her husband was very abusive). They had **2 children, age 3 and 5.** Ex-husband could only visit the children under the supervision Aunt's father.

&#x200B;

Fast forward some months... the kids' father begged to take the children out, unsupervised - for his birthday. Eventually, aunt's father agreed to his request. The day came; he picked up his children and drove off.

&#x200B;

**He wanted to teach my aunt a lesson for divorcing him... he  strangled his eldest son and stabbed him over 50 times. Then, he stabbed the youngest twice in the chest and proceeded to drive over his body.**

Aunt's father never forgave himself for allowing the kids' father to take them away.

Of course he was sent to prison, but he escaped less than a year later. Got a job with the government by lying, and just like that, he was a free man. 

A few family members and I, are almost certain the harrowing nightmare triggered schizophrenia in her. She is not diagnosed, and no one talks about it / it isn't really acknowledged.

So, if Akathisia is your only symptom out of those for a mixed episode... it‚Äôs more likely to be either primary Akathisia or secondary but from a different source.
