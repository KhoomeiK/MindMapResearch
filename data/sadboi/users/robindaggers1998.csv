See id like to think they would come forward by now, unless they actually killed Tegan themselves or have done something illegal in regard to her.

I believe the original facts from the nurses notes were that she’d left the hospital at 2 and had a wedding to be at by 3 with quite some distance between the two and needing to get ready beforehand, though the nurse later changed this to 11-2. She was only a young girl so I highly doubt she had any idea how to remove a body as seamlessly as she did. 

I also wonder why, if she didn’t hand the child over to anyone, she didn’t just dump the baby at a discrete location in hopes it’d be found? I guess she would have figured that it would be found out through media that it was her child after some investigation."

I knew helpable wasn’t a word when typing it, but I didn’t really think reddit partook in the sort of needless belittling and criticism over something like grammar that you do.

Seems like you’re a very sad person who lacks compassion for anything at all, including other people. The calls coming from inside the house dude. If you’re as smart as you think you are, you’ll figure it out. If you’re not, keep this sort of energy away from an otherwise pure intended page.

GetMotivated,f0ohizg,t1_f0oggsv,1568811268.0,"That’s a good take. I think they also sort of work in synchrony within each other. Lack of motivation increases depression, depression increases lack of motivation.

But at the base of it all, it is still nice to see uplifting messages like this. Sometimes messages like this get me through the day. But the real life treatment of depression (gold standard being medication and therapy, combined with healthy lifestyle factors) is where the real progress happens.

Being able to say fuck you to depression is something I’ve only achieved with a massive amount of self help, introspection and therapy. Not everyone is in the position to do that."

You think no one else has experienced that? Wrong. You think you can tell people who probably have well informed opinions on your situation to suck a dick? You have an obvious attitude problem and that’s just at a surface level. It genuinely bothers me because, its fucking hard not to think that way. It’s hard to get out of bed and it’s hard to have a good ass day.

I couldn’t be providing all the genuine care, love and effort enough for the two of us. I would gas him up all the time, help him when he was sad/stressed/sick, drive him to and from work, tell him I love him before bed, check up on him and take photos with him when we were at mutual parties. I was always trying to act silly to make him laugh or thinking of something fun to talk about or finding ways to make him feel appreciated and happy. I kissed him all over, I gave him massages. Ive cuddled him until he’s fell asleep. I knew all the small little things about him, and I don’t think he even knew me. I don’t know if he was ever really interested in knowing me. I was catering to his life, his interests, his schedule, his friends and family, because that’s what he wanted. It was exhausting. I slowly realised I kept giving and coming up empty handed. I didn’t know what he was contributing to our love anymore. Maybe he asked me to hang out with him at his place sometimes? Maybe if I was really lucky he’d call me beautiful? Not only that, but he would occasionally even bring me down. He would say or do unthoughtful things, or lie to me. He’s cheated emotionally, and I don’t really doubt that he has physically. I don’t think it’s important to keep track of reciprocal behaviour, but when love isn’t selfless and giving from both sides, it isn’t truly love. Love will fail like this. 

I instinctively pushed him away because I was neglecting myself and it was hurting me significantly. He didn’t understand that you simply can’t be selfish in a relationship. When the balance is off, the other party is drained, and in my case it was extreme and relatively long term. Sadly it was more important to him that I “be more social” with his shitty friends who are worse than him or that I was the happy person he met, rather than the fact I was emotionally drained to my core and had fallen into a deep depression which ended up resulting in a trip to the hospital he didn’t bother to visit, call or text me about. Break ups are hard and no one wants to initiate them, but it’s so easy to hold onto the hope someone could be a certain way in the future when they’ve literally shown you that they can, when they want to. I hope it’s a little easier knowing someone else went through this too! 🥺"
depression,f0mx9dj,t3_d5eg6v,1568755209.0,"I understand the need for others to empathise with us, I really do. This is why I will ask friends if they want advice or support when they come to me to lean on. But there are clear, proven links between the benefits of some practicalities and depression. Depression isn’t as physically debilitating as it makes us believe it is. And trust me, I’ve been in bed for 3 months straight before. Going to see a therapist and doing exercise have genuinely worked wonders for me, and have I wanted to do them? No. I wanted to cry leaving my bed. Just gets a little easier each time I for force myself to get out of my bed and drag myself outside. 

Being stuck in the false mentality that we are trapped inside our head and there’s nothing we can do about it isn’t fair on us, and contributes to negative thinking patterns and depression. It might be a million times harder for us to achieve normal practicalities than the non mentally ill population, but it’s possible."

BreakUps,f0ldbii,t3_d5byxr,1568711904.0,"Yeah my ex did this. Biggest softy, super giving blah blah. Made me feel like the centre of his world. Few months went on and I was sort of like huh, didn’t know you were EXTREMELY selfish. As well as stubborn/insensitive/ignorant/impatient. Got worse and worse. I was so drained by him, it was extremely toxic for me. I waited on him to go back to being the man I met(I figure rough patches/growth are necessary in long term relationships), but that just wasn’t him. I had no resources to even love myself by the end of it. He blamed the breakup on losing feelings and other minor things about me, but honestly he’s just a not-so-great, extremely selfish person who does everything to get a bright girl, uses them, gets bored when they learn his true nature and grow tired of giving 100% of the love and effort, and he leaves. His other ex feels the same way. He doesn’t know how to love. 

He thinks the right person will come around and change this about him- and he’s right, it will. For a little while. Guess that’s easier for him to think that than to actually use introspection to see that maybe he’s the determining factor in his failed relationships. But that’s none of my business.

Too often relationships (particularly those pursued by men) are fuelled by egoism and hedonism. They just want to fulfil something within themselves. They’ll take their share and leave. After all, if we were looking for real love, we wouldn’t put on a front like this when meeting others. Real love is genuine. Putting on a show in efforts to claim someone’s love is setting yourself up for failure, and it is unashamedly working to selfishly attain something for yourself on the basis of a lie. This isn’t how we love, and love will never be achieved this way. Love needs to be selfless and honest if it will ever grow and progress."

love,f0l4su5,t1_f0l3w68,1568698616.0,"You’re so right with this. I think a main thing for me was that I didn’t feel like our relationship was progressing due to the lack of quality time we were having. I adored him but we were sort of in a rut. It made both of us consistently sad to not be able to see each other very often, too. I felt like he was growing separate from me, sort of like watching your kid grow up in another home. It is really unfortunate and it’s a weigh up between pushing it out until circumstances eventually get better or letting go. I think we both wanted the latter because we were very young and had a lot to learn and do for ourselves. It sucks that the relationship is the first thing to be cut off. This was his first relationship and he would have had no clue about going through rough patches. I didn’t really either, as my first relationship was abusive and unhealthy anyways. I feel like the breakup provided me with invaluable hindsight, and it also allowed me to become a lot happier within myself, and to be more productive. If anything came out of it, I think we both learned a lot. Excluding my first boyfriend, we basically learned how to date together. We learned about communication, sacrifice, compromise, all the things. Maybe we learned not to give up on things when they get hard circumstantially. Maybe in the future we’ll bump into each other and fall in love all over again. Who knows"

Exactly. Just thought it would be a demonstration where family love isn’t always true and tethered. Though this is a lot less uncommon than it is in love. She’s estranged from that family now. 

Guess the bottom line is in majority of cases so called ‘love’ isn’t really worth the feat, nor is it usually what we believe it to be. But in a whole world full of romantics, continual ignorance is inevitable. But I do believe that true, unconditional, realistic and rewarding love is out there, however rare it may be."

I know what you mean about the feelings of being bulldozed and feeling worthless. All of that’s completely normal and don’t feel bad about it for a second, you’re not a brat. And then you feel like you have to feel the brunt of emotions while they go out living their best life like nothing ever happened. It causes so much unhappiness and resentment. But even still these feelings only prevent our own growth. It sounds like you don’t love yourself enough! 🥺

It really pays to take a step back from them, and remember who you are outside of them. That your life actually doesn’t and never did need them. That you’re a whole, amazing person alone.

love,f0iqzmf,t1_f0ios2k,1568645704.0,"Honestly, I do think about that. I’ve been in love but feelings have dissipated after we have got used to each other. And I think the most part of that is due to the unrealistic romanticisation and glorification of a fairytale love. The emotional and neurochemical high of love fades, but if you have what it takes to put the hard work into what comes next, I think love is sort of just like an extra special best friend.

Edit: I also think relationships are extremely overrated. People place way too much value on dating. It really isn’t popular or even normal to be single, especially after going into your 30’s, despite it being a fine and healthy thing to do. We don’t *need* a special someone that dotes on us and we dote on them. Sometimes, I think, if you find the right person, it’s just a really fun alternate route. You have someone that always has your back, and who will go through everything life has to offer right by your side. Might not be all heavenly and exciting but more like a warm blanket at the end of a very cold evening. Gets all your jokes, knows you inside out, all that. A special best friend. The big old feelings might fade, but feelings aren’t all that love is. You choose that person and commit to that person every day, because of the reasons you fell in love at the beginning and because they’re your favourite person to be around, cause at the end they’re still your bestie. I think feelings of love still come around in little waves, it’s just not like we expect it to be."

Some of us have a hard time being intimate with others, and that’s an issue that needs to be helped by therapy. Just thinking about it, we also need drive and a purpose. When we metaphorically sign out of life we stop that from happening, which makes us more depressed. And we need correct emotional responses. Life gets you down sometimes, and we need to know and believe that that’s ok and it’s all apart of the natural human experience, not that we’re bad people or everyone is awful and out to get us. Some of us are perfectionistic and quit things as soon as we don’t see immediate rewards or have a set back. Some of us are extremely sensitive to the outside world and what others could say about us or do to us. Many of these things that add so much weight to depression can actually be helped but it isn’t easy to undo years of a pattern of thinking and behaviour."

BreakUps,f0gko8m,t1_f0g2nvn,1568601296.0,"I know exactly how you feel. I tried to be friends with my ex for a while because I do genuinely enjoy his company. Trust me, we can chat for hours and hours and hours and laugh until we cry. It’s great. But it did nothing except keep me attached. He simply didn’t appreciate what we had, and I couldn’t try force him to see that anymore. Going no contact was the best thing I ever did for myself. The hurt is so so much less, and I don’t have the opportunity to stalk all his social medias to hurt myself over who he’s seeing anymore, though I know he’s moved on with another girl. It’s hard to not compare yourself I know. I’ve thought “why wasn’t I good enough for him to give me all those things he’s giving her?” “How could he move on so quickly, did I even matter?” But honestly, it’s nothing but a reflection on them. There’s so many reasons he could be appearing to give her all these things; they just got together and he’s trying to impress her in the early stages, he wants a rebound to fill the void, he feels as thought he clicks so much better with her. 

The point though is they didn’t put the effort into what I can imagine was once a great relationship. They have let it fall away, and that’s their mistake and that’s on them. I don’t want to give you hope, but in many cases, they will probably repeat the same mistakes with someone new. They could also end up happy with them. It doesn’t matter because at the end of the day we are the only ones that can determine our self worth. Don’t think of this as a you problem, because you know deep in your heart it isn’t. This boy has his own worries and concerns and life to live now, and it’s nothing to do with you, it’s just who he is as a person. You have no choice but to rise up and claim back the power in your life that you are important, and you are SO much more than your relationship to him. I would strongly strongly suggest going no contact even thought it’s excruciating for the first month. It’s extremely freeing afterward."

depression,f0gipnq,t1_f0g2p8f,1568600321.0,"Thanks! It’s hard to get into a mindset where you think you can do this stuff, so I understand why people might think it’s impossible, but it really isn’t. There’s a huge array of literature done on exercises positive affect on mental health so just thought I’d point it out.

For background info, I’m definitely not ignorant and have struggled with depression/anxiety since I was about 11. For the past 3 months up until recently I couldn’t get out of bed. 10am, 2pm, 5pm passed I could not move, eat or drink. Genuinely I thought my body would shut down. I went to therapy and changed my thinking and my attitude, though sometimes I just have to really scream at my brain. Sometimes I genuinely wanna cry leaving my bed but it feels better and is better for me, even if it’s just a little"

BreakUps,f0e45cp,t1_f0dwabs,1568562910.0,"First of all, I’m so sorry for how your ex treated you. I resonate with these thoughts so much! And you’re so right, you will find someone who truly deserves you, and who is right for you. But I am gonna try to challenge you a bit here. And this is stuff I obviously am struggling with too. It’s so natural to hold a bit of resentment and anger toward our exes, especially when they’ve done wrong by us. The amount of times I’ve said “he’s gonna end up miserable” or “he’s gonna realise my worth and come back around but I’ll be gone” are COUNTLESS. But you know who these thoughts are hurting? Us. It does us so much better to not fight against what has happened, but accept it and try to move past it. It’s very possible your ex could turn out miserable in the long run. But it’s also very possible she will be happy! Letting go means that it isn’t our concern anymore. We don’t need to hold the burden of anger anymore, because it only hurts us. She is on her own path, making her own mistakes and learning from them. If she can think logically, she will realise that you treated her AMAZINGLY, if she doesn’t already know this. But does it matter? You are the only person who can determine your self worth here. Try not to channel any energy into thinking of her or holding anger. The only person that matters here is you. Letting go sounds so cliche but it really is something to strive for, because it is so freeing when we reach it.

I’m so glad you felt impacted by my post and thank you so much, I wish you all the best xx"
depression,f0dh99c,t1_f0abtek,1568554123.0,"honestly... it’s true. Depression isn’t physically debilitating, I can force myself to do a workout. Most of the time I genuinely just really don’t want to, what’s the point, more suffering, and I’d rather die or lay in bed and wallow or I’m pretty positive I’ll pass out if I do exercise, but on the days I’ve legitimately DRAGGED myself outside, told my brain to shut the fuck up, and just gone and lifted some weights or even gone for a walk/jog... I’ve felt at the very least I’d say 3x better. At the most I’ve felt over 100x better. Exercise is proven to be a major major fist in the face of depression, and good news is it’s not the only thing that helps"

I’ve basically been in the exact same situation except my now ex boyfriend never accepted or acknowledge my depression, as well as the fact his behaviour was contributing to it A LOT. I still feel so down knowing that he probably thinks I’m just lazy and heading no where in life when I was in genuinely hospital a few months ago (of which he did not visit me, not even a call or text - and we were still semi together). Just trying to remember I’m not a bad person and that I can do this shit. It’s hard"

BreakUps,f068xhd,t1_f04mce1,1568432201.0,"Be grateful for the small victories! I’m in an awful spot right now, and it’s easy to think that it’s always been awful and it will never get better. But when you really try to think, there have always been times in life where a little light has shown through. Small happy moments. Roll around in those like a pig in mud!

Try not to focus so much of your energy on the outside world. Your peers aren’t as important to you as YOU should be to you. You’re amazing! Try to think of all your dreams, passions, the things and people you love, the things that make you you. That’s why you’re here. Only you can fulfil yourself- I promise your peers couldn’t do that for you even if they doted after you. Whatever their behaviour is, is a reflection on them alone. Believe in yourself. You deserve to grow. You deserve to have your voice heard. I’m so proud you’re still battling with life, it’s hard out here sometimes.

If you’re anything like me, you might not feel like a superstar because you don’t give yourself enough credit, if any. We are our own worst enemies. I can promise you that I do and (having known you) would think you’re a wonderful person."

infp,f03cxa2,t1_f02xyod,1568352025.0,"This sat so right with me. I’m so externally focused that it makes me shy away from the world. The world can be shitty and when it is, it affects me greatly as I take every single little thing to heart. I just wanna hide away. I’m so comfortable being alone. But it isn’t the functional or healthy thing to do so I’m trying to change it.

It really does all start with loving yourself and believing that what you think and what you desire outs of life is important, no more or less than anyone else out there. Then you’ve gotta start thinking well what’s the worst that could happen if I go ask this shop assistant where something is? Why should I care if that were to happen anyways as it’s not a reflection on me? All you can do is be a bit selfish and think about yourself. Really gotta grab life by the balls."

“No. I don't buy it. That is not the reason you made us listen to this. Oh, really? Then what's the reason? Let's look at the facts here. You made us sit down and listen to this story about how you met mom. Yet mom's hardly in the story. No. This is a story about how you're totally in love with Aunt Robin. And you're thinking about asking her out, and you want to know if we're okay with it.”"

relationships,ezoctka,t3_d1obvz,1568020413.0,"I think it’s pretty normal to develop crushes while in a relationship. There’s thousands of people compatible enough with us to date in the world. Whenever I’ve caught myself getting a little lovey dovey over someone else I’ve always distanced myself completely from them so as to not allow feelings to develop. If I was single, it would be great to go through those early stages of liking someone, being flirty etc. it’s fun!! But I decided for myself that I wanted to be committed, and that means letting go of these small mischiefs, and actively staying away from them. Trying to get close to them and to give fuel for those feelings to grow is dishonest to your partner and your relationship. It sucks because you might feel it would be a great friendship with them, but you can’t lie to yourself about the fact you do have feelings. 

If you know you love your partner and you’re happy being committed then don’t fret over the grass being greener. Chances are even with this new guy, if you two had dated, you would at some point feel this same way.  Ensure you’re happy in the relationship you’re in and stay committed. It’s worth it in the long term. I personally much prefer being told about any feelings, hiccups, or whatever in the relationship, as we’re supposed to be working as a team, though I know (and especially if your boyfriend is the worrying type) that the weight of the thought that your partner could like someone else is A LOT. But in being told about this stuff, I feel secure that my partners identified this feeling and is committed to being upfront, honest and committed to me. In saying that, it does sound like you two have some trust to work on if you wanted to be at that point."

I’m sorry for your loss! 8 years is a long time :( I was sort of in the same situation breaking up. He was only 19 when we started dating and couldn’t make the commitment anymore. Feelings had apparently faded and he just wanted to go out in the world and try new things meet new people, work on himself while he was young. It’s annoying because while I never wanted to do this, it’s been a really good decision for both of us. What you described is exactly how I felt for months, “a bad dream.” It feels like it could just go back to normal because they still have some feelings toward you and it never does. It’s ok to feel this way. Moving on is hard. Wishing you the best, feel better soon. x"
