NoFap,fqzo157,t3_glt8bi,1589771459.0,"Same bro I just relapsed again. But, to be honest, I learned how to stop relapsing. Whenever you wake up in the morning don’t stay in your bed for a long time, and if you have the urges do something to keep yourself occupied. Also, don’t look at pictures or videos that will give you an urge. We’re in this together, and good luck!"
depression,fprawm7,t3_gf1uov,1588848645.0,"I feel the same way, I always think I’m not good enough.  But remember I’m not perfect, and everyone else is not perfect. So, don’t worry about being good enough because it will only lead you into a bad mindset in the future."
depression,fpralqy,t3_gf10m6,1588848351.0,"I understand how you’re feeling during this quarantine. I’m nearly done with High School. To be honest, I don’t know if I have genuine friends in high school. I also have anxiety how people think about me, but in the end I don’t care what people think when I’m in high school/in the real world because they won’t matter in the future. Also, I coped with anxiety by talking to my brothers, and my parents. Without them I don’t think I’ll still be here. By the way, your not alone, and please don’t try and injure yourself. I believe we were born for a reason. I wish you good luck in the future bro!"

But, please don’t try and injury yourself during this quarantine or after the quarantine has finished. To be honest, I never been in a relationship with a person. All I can say is she probably still by your side right now as a spirit, and she will always be in your heart, memories, by your side. I know this sucks.... However, don’t lead yourself into a dark pathway because I’ve been there. A quote I learned from my teachers in high school is “Life is unfair.” I wish you good luck in the present day/future and I give you my condolences."
