depression,fib346w,t3_f791jw,1582313639.0,"Currently me...i feel like I'm going insane. None of it makes sense. I start counseling again on Sunday. It's hard trying to express this feeling. Only thing that comes to mind is numb. My thoughts and memory is shit. I hate work to the point I haven't been getting there on time, call in. I have no friendships and I'm barely present for my kids. Its an exhausting routine."
Codependency,fbar1nb,t1_fb9y68m,1576684870.0,This is me. I am interested pls message me
Codependency,f7gq0vp,t3_dvr6x9,1573712344.0,Thank you for sharing. This is perfect
depression,f77eggu,t3_dudwf7,1573453088.0,"This is so me. All the time. I have four kids that depend on me daily. It's hard to let them down so every day I put on a brave face. My 18yo sees my pain. She holds my hand every day on any drive we take. To the store, school. I'm on fmla bc my symptoms of depression, which include exhaustion, headaches, and insomnia, started up again. Work knows I'm productive so I must be okay. It sucks but I'm mindful of when it's hitting. No one cares and even if you explain no one will ever understand. It's easier to put a front but few see through it. I don't have the support and some days are harder than the others. A week after my symptoms came back I found out my fiance had been cheating on me. That was a hard pill to swallow on its own. The reason I got why he cheated was bc I was depressed and he didn't know how to be there for me. My only question to him was if I had cancer would you have cheated or supported me during a difficult time? So I get it and I hate that people can't see the pain, the hurt, the sadness. You wouldn't tell an I'll person to get over it. I wish people understood how horrible this feels. It's definitely very lonely."
Codependency,f6l5oek,t1_f6kvv5n,1572929790.0,Meditation and CBD. I think calming your thoughts helps. Especially if you're impulsive like I am.
Codependency,f6k65qg,t3_drma16,1572905803.0,Just some word of advise. This constantly happened to me through out my almost 4 year relationship. You can't depend your happiness on your partner. You're already setting him up to fail. You need to find healthy ways to cope with your depression.  My fiance cheated on me with his ex wife and his excuse other than being a dick was he didn't know how to deal or help me when I was down. It made me angry and resentful when I expected him to save me from the pain. It doesn't work that way. If your bf left tomorrow what would you do? Your depression would still be there and the need to feel better would be too. You should maybe find a counselor/therapist. Smoke weed or try CBD. That has helped me tremendously.
Codependency,f6cfavb,t1_f6af7v3,1572785214.0,That's interesting. I've never heard of balabolka. I will definetly look into it. Thank you

Codependency,f69thry,t3_dqjsk2,1572747151.0,Would you recommend any books? I don't even know what I like lol
Codependency,f69pbev,t3_dqjsk2,1572745161.0,Thank you for sharing. I have horrible coping skills. One thing I planned on doing was buying a couch for my room and start doing this. With my depression I'm often tired and sleepy but I feel maybe listening to an audible book would help break bad patterns.
stepparents,ezv44ax,t3_d2cu35,1568166689.0,"I have 4 bio kids (18,16,12,8)
SD10, SS7, SD6
We both can not have any more kids but when I brought up the topic to my doctor she said yup it's still possible but we would have to do it asap. 
We entertained the idea for a few days . finally a kid of our own. Well that was short lived. We have become selfish with our alone time. We have both sets of kids on the same weekend schedule. Thanks BM & BD!!
We've come to the conclusion if we had a bio kid we wouldn't have a life. Its easier to just hand off the kids to the other parentals when it's their weekend and not worry about a damn thing lol"
stepparents,ezc3whz,t3_d0oqhw,1567829499.0,"My fiance and I were just talking about this the other night. In the last almost 4 years we've been together we have never said her name. It's always your ex or he refers to her as my ex. In the last few months we've been working on our co parenting relationship so we figured we start calling her by her name, which is a little weird lol. Her name is very common so I hear it all the time I just don't know what it is about saying out loud."
stepparents,ezc2pti,t3_d0p3wk,1567828986.0,We had the same issue. We just started obtaining the medical records or calling the pharmacy to check what was filled. Dad always has the custody order on hand every time just in case they give him a hard time. Communication from the other parent would be ideal but I know sometimes that doesn't work.
depression,eytqlhv,t1_eytitfy,1567443266.0,"I've felt like this all week. I realized I haven't felt anything for weeks and it scares me. Things have been so great. My relationship, my family life, work. I started doing individual counseling then that turned into couples counseling. But this overwhelming feeling I'm getting is frightening because I don't want to fall back into depression. I feel like it's starting again and I'm just waiting for the other shoe to drop. I truly hate this."
stepparents,eymw5qv,t3_cxn4kx,1567221935.0,"We had the same issue. 
We agreed on just having clothes, shoes, undies and socke here and same at BM and BD house. The kids get picked up straight from school on Fridays so we wash their clothes and send them back with it Sunday. 
The only thing that gets sent back and forth is their medication bag. Other than that each household is responsible for getting the kids what they need. I often over buy cute clothes from the thrift store so I'll send BM or BD extra so they won't complain if a top goes missing."

BPD,eymf5wp,t3_cxk48d,1567207348.0,I was just thinking about this today. I don't have BPD but I do suffer from depression. There have been several happy/sad life changing events that happened recently. I don't feel anything. I even thought wow I haven't been emotional. This feels better than having a depressive episode that lasts months. I guess I'll take it. Kind of sucks waiting for the next time I can't control my crying.
ADHD,eykzbmw,t3_cx8l03,1567172313.0,She's on the smallest dose of Vyvanse. We talked to her doctor already. She's been seeing the same doctor since she was 4. The doctor relates a lot to her bc she also has a son same age same diagnosis. We convinced my daughter to start back on bc she wanta to learn to drive. So that was the condition. So far so good. We've changed her meds a few times and this one does seem to help I think she's just being stubborn about it.
ADHD,eykxnpz,t1_eykxaac,1567171053.0,"Thank you. Very helpful tips. The thing with my daughter she is in denial of her diagnosis. She thinks her behaviors are normal. High school was a pain. She did not take her medicine the last 2 years, which she regrets bc she barely passed her classes. She says it dims her personality which I can understand but it's for the best. This year I'm encouraging it 1000 times more."
ADHD,eyjyabk,t3_cx8l03,1567131548.0,Tell me more. How did you go about doing this? My daughter has ADHD and it's her first year of college. She's 18 so she might not feel brave enough to ask but I'd like to look more into it. TIA
stepparents,eyii4q0,t1_eyih7kc,1567102770.0,Patience indeed!! Believe me i lost my shit a few time but life now is so much easier you can't imagine. There will be things that come up but at that point you feel like you over came this huge obstacle so trying not to rock the boat becomes a little easier and you're definetly mindful. Kids are much happier that's for sure. If it means putting prides aside for their happiness count me in.
stepparents,eyi7kuv,t3_cx0rz0,1567098606.0,"It's a double edged sword. Approach with caution. I'm a bonus mom of 3. When we first met she was all for meeting me and getting to know who her kids would be spending time with. Things were great at first then slowly became about how I'm controlling. She's a classic narcissist. We cut communication for a year. Fast forward 3 and a half years later. My fiance became tired of BM games and started having an open communication with her girlfriend (strange i know-but they have history and needed closure). GF, my fiance and I came to the conclusion she's a difficult person to deal with BUT we've all have made a conscious decision to help her. We had our first river date with the kids, which was our first, so far so good. She's been more understanding and flexible with our schedules. 

My relationship with my BD and his gf was argument after argument, police and just a plain hostile relationship. Bottom line she didn't like me and there was no way convincing her otherwise. I finally asked What can I do to make this better? That opened the doors to our now 2 year civil co parenting relationship. We've taken a family trip, dinner dates and going out to dinner as a family. Gf is a very prideful person. I just had to show her there was no agenda here and set boundaries. #1 Set Boundaries!! Definetly important. I'm friendly and open. I hate conflict but I learned that this takes time and won't be an overnight change but it is possible. 
Side note- not everyone will agree on a certain situation, everyone will have an opinion. Pick your battles. In the end its about the kid/kids. Bottom line the parents have the final say on their child just respect your SO if they side with the other parent. 
Good luck!!"

ADHD,extji1t,t1_extj0ps,1566569896.0,I scheduled an appointment with a new provider in a few weeks. May I ask what tests do they do for diagnosing ADHD?

ADHD,exss8yw,t1_exs9s1t,1566555102.0,I did bring it up but she said I should have been diagnosed a long time ago. It would be harder to diagnose at this age.
ADHD,exs4odj,t3_cu4y79,1566532216.0,"So I'm currently going through this at 35. My 18 and 12 yo children were diagnosed at a young age. Their father had some behavioral issues as a child and at some point was diagnosed with ADHD in middle school, never took medication. I always thought my kids got it from him. I was diagnosed with depression in 2011. Since then I just believed that was the root of my problems. I divorced my husband of 15 years and was single for 4 years before I met my current bf. Being in this new relationship has made me change a lot of my behaviors and seek professional help. In Nov of 2018 I suffered a major depressive episode that lasted over 6 months, which was triggered by a life changing event- my daughter graduating high school. At first I was told I had SAD then that turned into Bipolar II. Medication was started but due to a lot of side effects I stopped them. I was then sent to counseling which i attend weekly. My counselor thinks my issues are due to certain stressors. I honestly feel like I have ADHD. I catch myself feeling like I can't leave work unless everything is complete, I get easily frustrated and angry, my memory has gone to shit. When my kids talk to me I can't grasp what they're saying. I get easily annoyed at the fact that when I read something I have to read it like three more times to understand. At this point in age I feel stupid  that I can't have a normal conversation with out stopping and thinking about what I have to say next. Does any of this make sense?"

depression,ew34w3h,t1_ew0l3d8,1565064286.0,"I sometimes feel like I do that to people. I tend to over share,often. I see there facial expressions and it makes me embarrassed to the point I rather not communicate with anyone at all. This has made me so socially awkward."
socialskills,eurdicy,t1_eur2q1a,1563992725.0,I can totally relate. I work in patient care and of course people aren't always feeling well or having a good day but I agree a smile goes a long way. I normally just laugh after they leave. I know it's not me. Doing this for years has built my confidence to have better communication with those kinds of people. It just takes practice.
