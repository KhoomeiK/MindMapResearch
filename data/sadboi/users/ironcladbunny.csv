YAlit,f9355h6,t3_e3ercn,1575050151.0,"This week I finished:

*The Alloy of Law* by *Brandon Sanderson* - Honestly very much enjoyed it, the characters are very well written and it works well as a stand alone. It doesn't compare to *The Hero of Ages* but I didn't expect (what was originally written as) a stand alone to.

I'm working on:

*Shadows of Self* by *Brandon Sanderson* - Enjoying it so far, honestly I'm not enjoying it as much as *The Alloy of Law* but it is still a good read. Sanderson rarely disappoints me.

*Lady Midnight* by *Cassandra Clare* - Picked the up unexpectedly. I've read Clockwork and The Mortal Instruments, but was never drawn the this series. I've been unexpectedly blown away, I really enjoyed the other series, but this series seems to take what I loved from the other books and fix what I didn't like. I only have a 100 or so pages left, I finished most of it in a day. Very excited to read the rest of the series."

I mean it is a hard choice and many books have changed me (Eragon, Percy Jackson, TFIOS, Mistborn) but as a young reader nothing changed my perception of what books could be than If I Stay. I never cried from reading a book before I picked it up, and I actually had to switch to audiobook because I cried to much to read. It moved me, like truly moved me, and I have a much better understanding of how to deal with loss because of that book."

This was very different from my previous works and definitely the most effort I put into a piece. There are some mistakes and some places where the thread knotted on the groom,but overall I'm really happy with it.
