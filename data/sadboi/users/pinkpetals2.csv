BPD,fr164au,t1_fr14xwm,1589813970.0,"Yes, she was like 17 when she got with my Dad in his mid 30s. Went from living with her parents, to immediately getting engaged and having two kids, me being her first. I think she is also highly insecure. She used to do it to me, and my long suffering father...for some reason my sister remains immune to her behavior. I think she is undiagnosed BPD, or at least has traits. When she wasn't being an abusive POS, she was loving and spoiled me, so it was a total mind fuck. But as a lot of abusive people do, she thankfully mellowed out with age, and we have a pretty good relationship these days."

BPD,fr0jlfj,t3_glj9nd,1589797975.0,"I remember being in a group therapy session years ago. The therapist asked us to name types of abuse. Everyone had called out the obvious ones. I raised my hand and described my mother's treatment of me. Basically anytime she wasn't happy with me, she'd ignore me, Look Right Through me. Like I didn't exsist, or I didn't deserve to live. It would last for minutes, hours, months. In adulthood, sometimes a year. She was punitive with it. The therapist said what I described was actually more harmful to a child than any other abuse. My mother was also physically and verbally abusive, but her freeze outs took the greatest toll on me. That therapist totally validated me, after a fucking lifetime of her devalidating behavior."

He was a huge lover of comedy, but a couple weeks ago I suggested a new comedy special to him, and he told me doesn't find much funny these days. He is from Scotland, so anything to do with that he's interested in. He loves art, he loves music and it's history, he is an avid soccer (British football) fan, he loves books about Presidents, he was a merchant seaman, so he also has a passion for the water, ships and boats. He's not big on fiction, he likes a lot of biographies and memoirs. You're right that it might be hard to get him to read self help, but if I never acomplish anything again, I'm going to get my Dad better. I just need the right book, author, philosophy, quote, whether from an ancient time or modern, whether it's a poem, or a series of books, I don't care, I am desperate, I'll take any kind of suggestion from anyone."
