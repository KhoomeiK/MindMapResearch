depression,fnw4h7w,t3_g41t6v,1587311253.0,No words can describe how you’re feeling. All I can do is just send you love and pray. 💛
depression,fntckmk,t3_g3ljni,1587238952.0,"Yes, this happens to me all the time. Even if it’s just for holidays. I’m the type of person who always checks on my friends, especially since the quarantine, but it’s never given back (or it is, but very rarely). It’s pretty annoying at times because I feel like I’m “over invested,” if that makes sense. Like I’m always checking up on my older cousin, because she’s been having a tough time during the quarantine, and she also has own mental health problems that she deals with, and I help her a lot but I feel like it’s not really returned or she doesn’t care as much as I do. 

Even with the holidays, I’m always the first one to wish those who I check up on. And this past Easter, I didn’t wish the same cousin “happy easter” because I just wanted to see what would happen, and just as expected nothing happened (I ended up wishing her happy Easter late at night because I felt bad). 

I want to stop caring as much as I do because it’s pretty clear people aren’t always going to do the same, but I can’t help it because I know how much it sucks not having someone there. 

I’m in a pickle too."
depression,flcatou,t1_flc8l3g,1585024631.0,"Yeah, it’s pretty sketchy so I don’t know what to think. & yeah, it probably was for the best. 

Me too, I just want someone who I just “vibe” with lol! I’m not in university right now, but I’ve been twice-for two separate programs- I think half a year at each college, but I don’t think school is for me. Maybe it was the programs, I didn’t end up like either. Or maybe the professors, I don’t know. Just school as a whole wasn’t feeling right at the moment. 
I like art, but I’m not an artist! I don’t mind learning new things though. 

My boyfriend knows about my mental health, and he’s always supportive and trying to help me figure things out. I, personally, don’t really like talking about it unless I’m really feeling a way, then I’ll mention something to him. Other than that, I don’t like bothering him or others with my mental health, because I don’t want them to worry and stuff. 

I agree, all relationships are complicated. I know what you mean, I wish there was a right way too!

Ps. I don’t mind if we become friends and talk a little here and there! Are you Canadian?"
depression,flc7jmy,t1_flc6c6b,1585021976.0,"I feel the same way. I had a friend in high school who I thought would stay and be one of my good friends, and we would talk about our depression and deep things, but now we don’t talk anymore. I feel kinda used, because in high school she stopped talking to me because her best friend didn’t like that she was talking to me, but later apologized so I forgave her, but ever since high school ended, we haven’t spoken since and it’s been a few years. I feel like the stuff I told her, I shouldn’t have told her, because it was really personal. Given we both shared personal stories, but I feel like it wasn’t a good idea because now we don’t talk at all, and I kinda have a feeling she shared some stuff with people, but maybe I’m overthinking. (Sorry for unloading a bunch of stuff lol) (she also wrote a book, and I e-transferred her money, and she never sent me the book, but everyone else got it so I wonder if she talked shit... and I asked her twice and she said she mailed it twice but no tracking.....)

I feel the same way when you say you click with other depressed people, because I feel like we all understand each other but somehow like you said it blows up. I can’t maintain friendships either, because I feel like these days if you can’t offer something to someone, they don’t want to be your friend. Like I just want a friend who I can just talk to about things, (I have a boyfriend who I talk to, but like girl things or friend things, y’know?), or even just sitting with each other and just enjoying company. Or sometimes I feel like I over share too early? I don’t know, I feel like today it’s so hard finding genuine people."
depression,fgd14zr,t3_exo1z5,1580678015.0,This is so heartbreaking to hear; if you ever need someone to talk to we are all here to listen. Just shoot me or anyone a message and we’ll try our best. Much love.
Makeup,fepp8w3,t3_eq4nc9,1579326768.0,Abh for sure!
Makeup,feojero,t3_eq4x9t,1579300893.0,Maybelline fit me or L’Oréal true match!
Makeup,fdou91p,t3_emc8hk,1578613004.0,Hourglass or the Benefit porefessional! It’s worth it for smooth application of foundation and other cream products and as well to fill in pores. I have a lot of pores on my nose and the centre of my face so I find primer works very well to help remove them :)
Makeup,fc641ng,t1_fc63w9s,1577471784.0,"okie dokie, thank you!"
Makeup,fc640pa,t1_fc5wlrw,1577471767.0,"thank you, I joined! :)"
Makeup,fc63zbq,t3_egdgvt,1577471742.0,"Thank you! I’ll let you know! Someone just commented a sub and I think it’s what I’m looking for. Thank you so much for the conversation, you’re actually the first person ever I had a conversation with on here!! We’ll keep in touch for sure! Happy holidays to you and your family, and an extravagant new year❤️"
Makeup,fc5vyz5,t1_fc5v8aw,1577467062.0,"I understand, and I don’t mind if people downvote on my post or anything-everyone is entitled to their own opinion, it’s just some people get really malicious and rude. I never downvoted since I’ve been on Reddit, but I’ve only just started using Reddit after having it for I think a year (I tried last year and didn’t know how it worked, so left it alone lol!) I’m not the type of person to downvote something just because it doesn’t fit my aesthetic or anything like that, I just want everyone to be able to post whatever they want and not be targeted because maybe their palette cost more than someone else’s. 
Yeah, that’s what I was thinking too. I just kinda want a happy space for fellow users to post and discuss things. I’ll definitely let you know if I make something, but I think I need karma or something to be able to make it. ))): 
I personally think there could be a lot of others interested in something like this, if it’s promoted well. I just love seeing fresh new palettes or other makeup items lol!"
Makeup,fc5uip8,t1_fc5tvmw,1577466186.0,"thank you! i follow MakeupAddiction already, but i mean something where i can just post a palette and i can discuss look ideas, other products that go well with others, or just each other being happy that someone got a new makeup. i completely understand your point, and i wouldn’t want to be taking away from other subs, but some of them have so many rules and i just kinda want something where we can post whatever we want, without others hating or jealously. like i have new palettes that i got and old ones too that i’m sure others would love to see, the only problem i have is if anyone if going to be upset that i posted my KKW So Fire palette or my Huda Beauty Mercury Retrograde and say rude stuff, y’know? i’m not sure if that’s the best way to explain it."
Makeup,fc5tfbk,t3_egabdm,1577465478.0,"mine are kept all over the house lol, but if you have any small containers or even ziplock bags, those work just fine for me! you could even DIY something: i’ve done it before and it works!"
Makeup,fbvyqk6,t3_eeprsh,1577138024.0,"Setting Spray!!! Maybe the Urban Decay De-Slick Oil Control one, it’s amazing!!! And maybe the Nars Orgasm blush!!"
