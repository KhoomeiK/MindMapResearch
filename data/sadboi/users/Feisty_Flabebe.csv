StudentNurse,fqvn5cf,t1_fquxyyv,1589680803.0,Thatâ€™s our semester we just finished with OB and mental health. Some people worked but a lot of people got weeded out.
mentalhealth,fq0ql2e,t3_ggf7t8,1589036136.0,Congratulations! ðŸŽŠðŸŽ‰ thatâ€™s a big accomplishment!
StudentNurse,fpdkclb,t1_fpdk6lm,1588528692.0,I usually study with a group of ladies in my program but with this online schooling we donâ€™t get to meet anymore and that made this worse.
depression,fosi1ns,t3_g99heb,1588031114.0,I donâ€™t wanna actively kill myself but if something happened not sure I would do much to stop it.
StudentNurse,fnuf3wa,t1_fntiufx,1587260633.0,I am doing orientation the week after finals this year so I will have a year experience when I graduate and take boards.
mentalhealth,fniorvx,t3_g1fwt2,1586983701.0,Same. As much as my life has turned into a nightmare I have 20 days that have pockets of peace while playing.
mentalhealth,fng5gif,t1_fng3dnc,1586922782.0,That sounds like wonderful advice. I will try that tomorrow!
depression,fn1t51k,t3_fyl2w3,1586569496.0,I do really good initially meeting people and faking it. Once I get more comfortable I have a problem with letting the depression show and the self-deprecating humor fly and they usually run off.
