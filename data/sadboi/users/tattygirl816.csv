bipolar,fi32s3k,t1_fi24n7p,1582098306.0,I feel all of this 100% yesterday sucked for rage.  Made a fool out of myself in public so humiliated.  Just when I thought I was doing so well.  Glad to have you all who understand truly grateful

bipolar,fi32fng,t3_f65p97,1582097873.0,"I haven‚Äôt experienced impulsivity,  I actually used to be more impulsive when I wasnt medicated.

But yes 100% on the memory and aphasia issues.  I used to think it was from smoking pot, but I stopped smoking few months ago and still have issues with this.  I saw a post on this sub a while back about memory issues & aphasia being a BP/anxiety symptom.  I‚Äôm sorry I can‚Äôt find the source,  but it may be our disorder and not the medication.  Or perhaps a combo.   


why are there no perfect meds!  If I find the source info I‚Äôll edit this comment !"

Advice,falg7eo,t3_e9t04c,1576183840.0,"I‚Äôm so sorry about your dad,  can‚Äôt imagine how that situation is to navigate as his child. You deserve a father that is loving.  You‚Äôre right about maybe some things that have been said personally between them I may not know about.

And yes totally agree about the phone!! My bro can be a little shit sometimes too. 

Proud of you for maintaining your life independently and best wishes for you in school!  Very inspirational."
Advice,falfjjs,t1_falej9y,1576183528.0,"Thank you so much for the advice and positivity. Sounds like our families are similar ie misdirected anger.  Probably the Irish catholic/bottle things up situation going on in my case.

My sister just doesn‚Äôt want to hear when she is wrong, and you‚Äôre right she doesn‚Äôt communicate well or reach out ( unless she needs something. ). She‚Äôs funny and nice to strangers, but will to lift a finger for anyone, physically or emotionally"

bipolar,f66nwey,t3_dqdofu,1572712524.0,"Whyyyy AND god forbid you let your insurance lapse  bc you‚Äôre not on your meds and have a hard time staying organized!!

I don‚Äôt know if this exists in other cities, but I was able to get in really quickly (without insurance) at a community counseling and legal center.  It was not a health center,  but the counselor was a volunteer and experienced.  She referred me to a prescriber who was also volunteer and this saved my life. 


If you live near Boston message me, and if you don‚Äôt google community low income counseling!"
bipolar,f61la1r,t3_dq88yr,1572642064.0,"Hello!  I‚Äôm BP2 and lamotrigine is my favorite med I‚Äôve ever been on.  That being said it has a really short half life so don‚Äôt miss a dose and make sure you take it at the same time everyday, as I have had episodes like the second I don‚Äôt take it.  Also if you forget for a while and want to take it again, you have to see the doc and start all over with a low dose, moving up with the higher increments. 

Also if I have a lot of triggers happening at once i still fall apart,  so although lamotrigine is a big help I still have to exercise, sleep a ton, eat well, avoid stress- but like who doesn‚Äôt have to do that to feel happy.

My dear friend wasn‚Äôt successful with it but it didn‚Äôt give her any side effects, just didn‚Äôt work.   I know in high doses around 400mg it can make you feel sick as my mother takes this much for her epilepsy and doesn‚Äôt understand why I prefer this med. (I take 200mg p/day with no other med combos)


After years of taking ssri‚Äôs with no success,  this mood stabilizer was a god send.  I love how it doesn‚Äôt affect my libido.   I really hope it works for you!  Please reach out if you need anything.




TLDR: Less depression, but I still still have some rapid mood cycling."
