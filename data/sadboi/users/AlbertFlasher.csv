Young and old, most of my customers are mindful, but too many are playing it fast and loose and we're the ones that are going to get hit with it. If you're a couple, only send one person in! If you're a senior stay home, get someone else to shop! if you're a parent, leave your herd of snotty brats at home! If you come in wiping your nose on your hands and touching things, I don't give two shits if you have allergies, stay at home!

Unless you really need to take advantage of pcie gen4 there isn't much reason to spend extra on x570.

Check out this video by [Video by Buildzoid](https://youtu.be/zuyuS04lD4o) on Gamers Nexus if you want info about choosing a ryzen 3000 mobo. There was also a great [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/c7qj5e/am4_vcore_vrm_ratings_to_help_you_decide_on_a) a couple months ago rating which vrms are worthy of overclocking which ryzen 3000 chips.

I was in a very similar situation to you. My 2012 build with a 2600k was getting long in the tooth. I ended up with a 3600 on the msi b450 pro carbon (I'd like to find a used 3900x or 3950x in a few years to upgrade into and this vrm is great for even that). So far it has been able to all core push my chip to 4.3 and I'm not even on the latest ABBA bios yet. I'm running 2x8gb sticks of ram that I've been able to push to 3900mhz at cl16, and I feel there's still room to go in the timings. I have it paired with a gtx 1080, this machine performs better than I expected.

Good luck with your build! If you have questions about mine I'm happy to help!"
buildapc,f0sl4f6,t1_f0razfi,1568906672.0,Why would they be better suited for x570? The only real difference is the gen4 pcie lanes... You can get just as good power delivery and vrm cooling in x470 or even b450 for cheaper...

Most people aren't buying 2080ti or better and most people won't saturate pcie 3 with day to day workloads and gaming on nvme drives.

On that note, if you don't have a specific use case for pcie 4 either, then going with x470 won't hurt you at all."

I wouldn't be surprised if they were a bit more aggressive with promotional pricing over the next 6 months with these products because they don't want them sitting around any longer, but don't expect the price to drop the day ryzen 3000 releases.

Now if you were looking to build a pc I think it would be fairly likely to see these ryzen 2000 series CPUs take a bit more of a price cut, however they already have been steadily falling over the past few months.

In both cases it depends on how much stock these companies have on hand and how quickly they need it gone."
