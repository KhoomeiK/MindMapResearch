EatingDisorders,fnd13fx,t3_g0xc7x,1586854570.0,"I had the same problem. Used to restrict a lot the past year and now during this quarantine I've been binging every other day to the point where I gained a lot more weight than I lost. A few days ago I just literally forced myself to stick to my diet (around 1500) because I know I will lose it and become very insecure if I gain any more weight. I just picture the consequences. I now limit myself to these 1500 calories a day distributed to 3 to 4 meals a day. It is enough to get me through the day. And after a while a habit started to form and it got so much easier sticking to my diet especially after I started to see results.
So I think it's just literally forcing yourself to control yourself (by picturing the consequences) and trying to establish a solid habit (breakfast at 8, lunch at 12, dinner at 5) by repeating the pattern over a longer period of time."

You get an insight into the various affairs she has with women and how she tries to approach women she fancies, which was hard during those times. But it's also a lot of her talking about her estate, money and investments, so it can be a bit dull at times. What's pretty cool is that the parts that she encoded are shown in cursive, her secret affairs with women making up the biggest part of it.
So yep it definitely is worth a read if you are interested in some insider knowledge of her life."

In ninth grade there's a mandatory visit to Dachau to see the KZ. It just blew me away and seeing all that really gave me another perspective on these things.

So I guess they do their best to remind us of Germany's ugly past, and I'm grateful they don't pretend that nothing has happened."
