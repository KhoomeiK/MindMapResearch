Some of the test paper were not uploading for us to see, so on our side it seems like we finished grading, but some papers were not really graded. Also, the accessibility centre just sent us 8 more midterm papers to grade but a lot of TAs are busy with their work recently because this whole coronavirus situation. I will send the other TAs an email to remind them to finish grading the 8 midterm papers first. If the the test is still not graded completely by Saturday, feel free to send me an email (liying.he@mail.utoronto.ca)and I can remind them again. Again, I am sorry for all of this and hopefully this will not happen again.

Update: I think the other TAs are grading those 8 tests right now, you should be able to see the graded test in 20 minutes."

For question 3 and 4, I saw a lot of students wrote more than 1 answers and their answers include the correct one. I think it makes more sense to reward students if they got the correct answer.

I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder around two months ago, and when I told my friend, everyone was like “but you are happy all the time”. I can’t stop crying at night when I am alone, and I cry for few hours in the morning before I go to school. But when I am at school, I always behave like everything’s fine and I am so happy. Two weeks ago I couldn’t stop crying and having those suicidal thoughts, and ended up in the hospital. But the next day after they discharged me, I acted like nothing happened. 
This whole “I am happy” mask is making me feel even worse. But the good thing is my medicines finally started to work and I am getting better now. I think you need to see a psychiatrist as well. Those antidepressant drugs might have bad reputation, but they actually work."

If not, I think you should drop the course, and take it next semester. You can still attend the lectures and tutorials if you want to. A lot of students found MAT102 easy when they take it the second time. Once you get used to it, I think you will be fine."

I remember once I received more than 100 emails from my students the night before their midterm, and it took me more than 6 hours to reply all of them, and they kept sending me more.
