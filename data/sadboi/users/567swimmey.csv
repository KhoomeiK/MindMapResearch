Egalitarianism,fnybqte,t3_g4jgbb,1587358519.0,"Depends on what circles you're in since feminism is a very large group that spans many political ideologies. From my experience and what u have said about them, u seem to be in more centrist/liberal groups which tend to not agree with ""extremes"" like sex workers rights and usually are just a circle jerk of hypocrisy like you stated in ur post. 

I tend to like to be in more leftist feminist groups that include people that actually have read or are familiar with feminist theory, gender theory, and queer theory  as discussions tend to be way more nuanced and accepting of a lot of positions, and don't devolve into a weird mix of sexism for women and men. For starters, philosophy tube, a YouTuber, has a few extremly good videos on topics you might find interesting."

""Sec. 2. The Congress shall have the power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article.

""Sec. 3. This amendment shall take effect two years after the date of ratification.""

The draft is a thing that denies women access based on gender, so it will have to include women if this was passed. And yes many feminist were against this, but many were also for it as feminism (and I cannot stress this enough) is a very diverse movement with widely differing opinions."
Egalitarianism,flki9vi,t1_flkh26m,1585241438.0,"A) literally the equal rights amendment was created by a feminist and highly supported among many feminists and would make women have to sign up for the draft. It was rejected by a predominantly male Congress.

B) I literally never said that. Feminism is a very broad political movement that includes thousands of issues. The draft is just one among them. To say they are focus on one specific issue would be derivative and simply wrong since it is a movement with millions of people across hundreds of countries and dozens of different political theories behind it. There are so many subsections with contradicting views and different levels of radical ideas it would be impossible to summarize them all behind 1 specific issue."

Black men got the right to vote in 1870, yet didn't get many civil rights bills passed until the 1960s and 70s. Did they just not want civil rights and didn't fight for them at all through that time period? Obviously not, they always wanted more rights and constantly sought them, yet people didn't do shit till it got more support among the majority of people- white men and women.

Egalitarianism,flgr16x,t3_fogwbd,1585148616.0,"Y'all say this and want this so badly, thinking it will be easy to achieve and the only reason it hasn't been is because women are lazy and treated as ""special"". What y'all fail to understand is that it was an uphill battle for women to even be allowed into the military voluntarily.

https://www.history.com/news/women-fought-armed-forces-war-service

https://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/us_58c9630fe4b05675ee9c5c55

Extremely restrictive bans, refusal to allow women to serve a combat role during peace, refusal to offer veteran status, excluding women from military school and most military jobs until 2016, not to mention the social stigma surrounding the women who did fight. So many comments paint this picture of ""the only reason there isn't a female draft is because females don't want it"" but in reality a plethora of men hate the idea of women serving, fighting every decision in the court and some going so far as the supreme court to see if it's even constitutional to allow this. This ""specialness"" y'all are referring to is just sexism. Women are treated as ""special"" because people don't believe they can do work that requires physical strength, seeing it as unwomanly and a threat to women's health (seriously you would be surprised how many people think women serving in the military will harm their womb, make them gay, or make them be a trans man). Historically, women have been both socially and institutionally barred from military service (keep in mind women didn't have access to all the same job options in the military as men until FOUR YEARS AGO). 

This issue is a lot more nuanced than ""woman don't wanna"""

Secondly, they were testing some defensive strategies and seeing how they played out. Keep in mind these were tested with some of the lower end players on the team and with people that normally don't play defense. The whole point was to throw something at a wall and see if it sticks.

Thirdly, it was a PRACTICE match. It was not taken seriously. They were doing some fun practice for a future game with Russia (I think, might be someone else) and wanted to give the 15yo team a memorable day, allowing them to get pictures and autographs and more afterwards. 

So yes, they lost a friendly practice game, where they used different players in different positions, to 15yo. Doesn't sound bad now does it"

changemyview,f7gl432,t3_dvqix7,1573707197.0,"So I've read all of ur changed opinions so far but it seems no one has got you on gender and sex are the same and sex and gender are binary. Sex is a bi-modal distribution. It's true most people lie on either male or female, but the fact that 1% of the over all world population (77 million people) do not fit into that binary is extremely significant. Thus scientist go with the bi-modal distribution of sex since it is far more accurate and represents reality better.

As for gender it is not binry and there is a social construct. Even though as you put it 99% of males and females fall within that supposed binary, correlation does not mean causation. There no biological factor that makes men wear suits or women wear dresses. There's nothing biological that men are blue and women are pink
. Nothing makes pants a male thing and skirts a female thing even though with biology skirts would be better for most men since It would give more room for balls and prevent adjestment. Gender is merelt how society expects people to perform their sex. If you look at distinctly different cultures you will see a vase difference is how they perform their gender roles. 

Since gender is a social construct, it can be whatever the fuck we want, so there is no binary. Besides there half been a hand full of cultures that had a 3rd gender such as some native American tribes with 2 spirit and gender variant people and South Asia hijras. There existence is proof enough that a binary doesn't exist and is merely a construct based on western society.

Many nonbinary people, although there are many many types and categories, experience dysphoria over their presentation and the way society sees them rather than having dysphoria over their sex, or they do not have extreme enough dysphoria to warrant any hrt or surgery. Obviously there are still those that do, but a lot do not and prefer to change their outward appearance, such as hair clothes and such. These types of people feel stress because society sees them as a stereotype they do not fit into, into a category that for one reason or another they do not feel they belong to. There stress here is because society does not accept their variant gender and tries to fit them into a box of stereotypes that they are uncomfortable with. Nonbinary people only exist because there is a binary in the first place."

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgender_hormone_therapy_(male-to-female)

Most of the effects on weight happen at 3 to 6 months, and trans women aren't allowing into women's sports till at least 6 months to a year. Plenty of time for them to have muscle masses and fat percentage in female range.

Sorry for the assumption, but either you're male or a female with a extremely bad period cause most periods aren't like that. You're really exaggerating the effects it can have on a person. For professional athletes or serious highschool athletes they wouldn't take time off for a period. Pros are literally paid to train, they are not getting a period break once a month. Also working out makes your period less painful. https://www.livestrong.com/article/479293-how-does-exercising-affect-your-period/
There's also drugs to skip periods.

Sports is literally built on psyological and bodily advantage. Think of Michael Phelps who produced less lactate than normal people, giving him an advantage in training and races. In a lot of sports, height doesn't affect much and there are plenty of amazing players that are short
