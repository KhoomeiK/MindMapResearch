BipolarReddit,f062nrb,t3_cvhqxk,1568427194.0,"YES. SSRIs do mess with your brain. They calcify your pineal gland. I was given SSRIs since I was 16 and have been much worse ever since(I am 22 now) Didn’t realize until last year when I did research into how bad they can be for you. I 100% think my bipolar symptoms were brought on by these medications. I do think it’s a scam. I think keeping us medicated makes us worse and need MORE medication. It isn’t the answer. It’s lifestyle changes and managing feelings in a healthier way. Yes, it can become somewhat unmanageable but I would rather be a little out of control sometimes than be switching medications every few months and getting worse by the day. I went off medication about 6 months ago and things hurt worse but I feel more like myself. My brain is still pretty messed up though from all the meds and who knows if it will get better. Me and multiple people I know have noticed the SSRIs making things worse."
