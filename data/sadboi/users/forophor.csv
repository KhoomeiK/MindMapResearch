I like Yin Yoga a lot because I'm into building flexibility and stretching. Something [like this](https://www.doyogawithme.com/content/yin-practice).  

The most consistently high quality mindfulness podcasts I [find here](https://open.spotify.com/show/50yOGRLSNwrA5mDO2g5gt8?si=Ln_j4hXaSwGAMC06dZ7cLg) but if you're willing to pay for mindfulness apps they're a lot better at keeping you accountable and reminding you to practice.  

In terms of therapy/medical intervention - you're right; the hardest thing is to ask for help. If you're afraid of learning what weird illness you have or being put on a mind numbing drug just know that's pretty unlikely. Therapy is moving toward treating individual symptoms to improve quality of life and the first medication you're prescribed will be low-key if you're given one at all.

Your anxiety is totally warranted. We taught our minds/bodies to anticipate the alcohol and build up stress to release. That's the bad news.  

The good news is - this is a learned behaviour so we can outsmart it.  


I'm lucky and have access to affordable therapy but before I was doing that I found mindfulness to be super helpful. Whenever I got into the shower I'd search ""mindfulness"" in Spotify's podcast section and flip on something guided that related to what I was going through that day.
