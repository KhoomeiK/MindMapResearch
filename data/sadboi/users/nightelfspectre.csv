**Notes:** This is actually quite the adaptable set! Lots of room to adjust for level or job. Gloves can be swapped for Thavnairian Gloves or Pagos Field Dressing, the Brightlinen or Star Velvet Hood would also look great for the head, and the level requirement can be lowered greatly by removing some or all of the accessories.
