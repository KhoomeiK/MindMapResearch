William just made up that his claim to the english throne and the only reason the english lost was because of the fucking Norwegian invasion that the english just fought off at the same fucking time.   If King Harold hadnt lost so many men winning the battle of standord bridge and forcemarching his army back he could have won the battle of hastings and we would be speaking a language that makes fucking sense.

EVEN IF harold's claim was on shaky ground and taking it broke a vow, it was better than letting a norman bastard rule and effectivly wipe the anglo-norse culture into a shadow of its former self. The witengamont should have known better and chosen someone else to avoid this whole conflict anyway

Edward the confessor fucked up so bad when he didnt think about his succession.  You know he might have promised the throne to William (while alone and probably drunk at his castle in fucking normandy).  But id hazard a guess that if he would do something so fucking careless, he probably didnt intend for it to be the primary line of succession.  That or he just didnt fucking care.   Honestly i hate that he chose to be celebate because really thats what fucked everything up.   Theres a reason kings arent supposed to be priests in the catholic system you imbecile.
