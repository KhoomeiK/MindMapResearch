Second, don't be afraid to ask for help, especially from family. They may treat you differently for a while, but if that's because you need it and to make you feel better then so be it. Other than them if you have friends or someone else to talk to just that can be incredibly helpful. Maybe some strangers online too.

If you don't want to go to therapy for the same reason of not feeling ''alright'' and knowing that something is wrong then I can understand, but know that having someone from the outside know how you feel, someone who can give you actual help is great. Some people go to the therapist because they feel stressed...so if you have something more important then I suggest you start by talking to your family and then maybe check for some specialist even just to vent out.

You feel like it is not a good idea to talk about this to someone, but I think you should. If your fiancè got through a lot then maybe wait to tell her (only if you think this won't make her feel worse then telling her). But talk to someone, if she went through a lot you should be there for her and you cannot do it with such a burden carried only by yourself. And maybe to someone therapy is just a paycheck, but that can be a good thing. Think it as you are not burdening then, it is a job for them, and if  it help then it is still positive.

SuicideWatch,ffu6hnt,t1_ffu107o,1580235514.0,"If you say that nobody likes you you need solid proof. That's because it is easy to say that our friends and maybe even family appear to be disinterested and as though they don't like us, it happens. It's a rabbit hole quite easy to fall into actually...I have a really hard time with the same problem every now and then. Look at hard facts, it's probably untrue that they hate you. 
About you father you should try to speak with him. With someone backing you up if you feel like. Maybe it's bettere heart to heart, depends on you. A talk can go a really long way, even if you already spoke to him, do it again."
SuicideWatch,fftnffa,t3_ev6nc1,1580224945.0,Hi there. I hope I can help you. Surely I can talk with you if you need.
SuicideWatch,fftnda4,t3_ev6tcy,1580224905.0,"Planning your suicide can make you calm since it looks like that's it, but in the end it's different. 
I think you just haven't figured out what you are best at, and many face the same problem. So keep searching, don't give up! Strangers on the internet are there to cheer you on"
SuicideWatch,ffs0si0,t1_ffrtn4t,1580170363.0,No problem. Feel free to hmu if you want
SuicideWatch,ffrc04u,t1_ffrbrys,1580154911.0,I don't understand what you are talking about though.
SuicideWatch,ffrbweh,t1_ffraw04,1580154847.0,"Hey, don't apologize, we all have to be down sometimes. What's going on? if you want to talk about it."
SuicideWatch,ffralzq,t1_ffr98nc,1580154062.0,"It may be too late to save face, but it is not too late to live. Also, at this point, if you already can't save face accepting it is far better than despairing over it. Your family should support you, if they don't then you should seek counseling about that too. 

No matter how you think it now know that there is no fuck up too big if you are willing to face the consequences and make up for it. Of course, if you think that only some people see it as a fuck up and is something that you feel like it's worth fighting for then do that.

I am still not 100% sure what you are talking about in your situation though, so I can't give you my full opinion."
SuicideWatch,ffr8iqb,t1_ffr6yt4,1580152768.0,Sure
SuicideWatch,ffr6vbk,t1_ffr5fik,1580151738.0,"Hey there, how are you?"
