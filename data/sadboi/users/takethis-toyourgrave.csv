Color drains from your face, the floor feels like its melting beneath you, everything feels unsteady, like the world still spinning. Every sound is too loud and overwhelming, coming from every direction. You feel beyond sick like the contents of your stomach could projectile from your throat at any second. You feel like every set of eyes is on you. People are talking to you but you cant hear what they're asking, but you feel that expectation put upon you, waiting for you to answer. But you can't speak. You're shaking. You feel like if you open your mouth you'll vomit. But they're all watching, staring, waiting. You want to run, but you cant move cause the room has melted away. Reality slips from your grasp and you just wish you were unconscious rather than dealing with this chaotic mess consuming you.

That's anxiety."
AMA,fbm2ff1,t1_fbkp1x4,1576976551.0,"This is part of my situation that doesnt quite have a clear solution, so I can only advise on what I can suggest might help. 

At one point when I use to deal with this a lot, I would sleep with a towel, either over me like a blanket and the covers on top. Or under me like a sheet.

I would also sleep with a thin sheet so that it feels like a blanket is over me without actually holding in much heat that would escape me in the night.

Another suggestion may be to try going to sleep with a cold, wet cloth over your forehead, behind your neck or against your chest. I would normally wet a small cloth, ring it out until it's not dripping and then either use that, or put it in the fridge/freezer when I needed it even more cold. 

Unfortunately, there's not much to do for this. I believe there is a possibility that doctors could prescribe something for excessive sweating but I'm unsure. I have not approached any doctor with this issue but I have heard others speak of it.

I wish you the best of luck with this. It is a hassle to deal with and I only hope some of my advice could come in handy. Best of luck, mate."

When I was first diagnosed I was given a prescription I was told would ""fix it"". I looked at the psychiatrist with skepticism but she assured me it would ""cure it entirely"". The first night that I tried it I was pulled into a very discomforting sleep. I sweat through my sheets thrashing about (as my partner at the time informed me) until I was jolted awake violently, bolting straight up in the bed. I remember the room was blending and spinning and vibrating so intensely that I could see nothing but waves of color and light. I apparently tried to stand and crashed into the book shelf, staggering to my knees then dragging myself across the floor to try and reach the bathroom. I was trying to get to the toilet to puke. But the second I put my back against the bed I was shocked into paralysis by the sudden appearance of a massive levitating eye in front of me. It was beaming straight through my soul, ripping through my thoughts, threatening me with a force that I could not describe. I dont know how long it lasted. But all I know is the entire day I was freezing and shaking with cold sweats and vomiting off and on. I ended up calling the psychiatrist to tell her I would not be taking them again. And I didnt. 

Ive had other prescriptions to do with sleep but they are sleep aids and not meant to rid someone of nightmares. I have found that nothing seems to get rid of the nightmares. Sleep aids can be very useful to ensure you are able to sleep when you feel like you cant because of what might come during the unconscious. So the only thing I could suggest, medication wise, from my experience would be natural sleep aids like Melatonin which, I have found hardly have any nausea or health side effects. They do not get rid of the nightmares but they help me a lot when I feel like I could never sleep again.

Yes, very often for very many different reasons. But to do with this disorder specifically, I have found that many people in practice do not consider it a disorder to begin with. (Often the same people who claim to not believe the validity of disorders like Dissociative Identity Disorder, which has had extensive evidence to prove that it is real, which they refuse to acknowledge). Many people have not known what I was talking about when I've brought it up. Others dont believe it is anything to be concerned with. But they aren't the ones dealing with this every night, every day of their lives. So, in my opinion, they have no right to speak upon it. But, in short, yes I have. And my advice to anyone who is faced with this is to find one person who doesn't turn their nose up to it. Whether it be a therapist or a doctor or a mentor  anything. Having just one person be able to believe you and understand what you're going through is detrimental, makes all the difference. It carves off a bit of the isolation and shame.

Yes, I have experienced a wide variety of nightmares that seem to dig for deep rooted emotion and at times, they do combine. The clashing of emotions is often a subject for turmoil within the nightmares. Though each can have its range of physical and emotional pain used to torment and torture my mental state.

In varying degrees, it does. I have always found that expression through writing is far far easier for me than any form of communication. I have trouble with trust and paranoia of sharing my thoughts aloud with others in fear of the reaction my words will have. I become extremely obsessive about trying to make my tone, my word choice, my speech pattern, my mannerisms, my thoughts and direction of thoughts and my understanding of others work correctly to convey the message I am trying to get across to someone. And there is always one element that falls short, leaving me seeming like an awful person or that I dont care or that I'm too sensitive or not sensitive enough. And then when I get those negative reactions it makes it even harder to try and speak again. And coming from a past of trauma I have had my fair share of violent punishments for such things.. So, yes. Writing is my ideal format. Through text and words, screens, ink and paper, I cannot see the person..I can write exactly what I mean to without room for error, I can go back and erase and rewrite before anyone can hear it and get the wrong idea. I can make sure exactly what I want to say is being said. And that is far easier for me than anything aloud."

But yes, the ones that do not have names - if I see them more than once and I feel it is needed that I call them something, either in reference or toward them, I do try to find a fitting name. I usually just stare at them, or my visual of them and let sounds and letters come to me. Usually I can find something fitting. If not I give them a title."

When I am feeling weak or a particularly awful one catches me when I'm not expecting it, it can often throw me into panic attacks or lapses of severe paranoia.

But, somehow it didnt seem to notice me. When it began to feed, it heard me breathe and whipped its head up, locking its eyes to me. For a moment I felt like we had communication without saying anything at all. I remember watching it stride toward me, shutting my eyes as I felt it huff a hot, blood tainted breath in my face. And when I opened my eyes, there was no blood. There was no creature. No bodies. Everyone was moving about as they normally did. It stuck with me for a very long time.

I was tested on antipsychotics for a long period but the effects from it were far more detrimental to my mental health than they were helpful. They dulled the constant noise in my head but it only made it into a massive cloud of incomprehensible  sound and agitated me greatly. And the hallucinations that could break through that suppression were saddening hyper realistic, more vivid than even I see on a daily basis. And they were awful and horrid and would send me into complete mental shut down in my weakened state. They determined that it was a threat and had to take me off of it. 

Now, I take medications for other things though. Like anxiety and medication for sleep. Of course they dont change anything about my schizophrenia, but they do help with other conditions and aid in my daily life."

My mind will just circle over and over on what I had seen, making me watch it again and again so that I do not forget it.

None of the medications I take remove any of the hallucinations but I find it's better to manage this was than to try and live life the way it was on medication.

As for your second inquiry, I would have to say that this question is something I have asked myself and asked many professionals. To which no one can give me the true answer. Some have told me it's simply twisted versions of things I must have seen in media... Though none of the things I see match anything I've ever watched. Some tell me it's the chemicals in my mind having a warped acid bath that churns out this stuff. Some have suggested that I may actually be seeing tormented spirits and creatures unseen by others. Some say I am seeing through to an alternate reality.

I listen to all theories people have to offer me but I can honestly say that none of them know for sure how it happens or what they are. And neither do I.

I watched Sixth Sense once...and honestly cant remember much about it. I know after watching Shutter Island I was trying to explain to the person that I was with that it was sort of like what I experience. I think they did really well making the hallucinations impossible to distinguish from reality for the character. But I don't remember the details of the film.

I do have ways to test it though that I try to do subtly if I can. Like handing someone an object. If I pass something to them and they can take it from me, they are real. If it ends up falling through their hand I know they aren't. Certain things like that are usually my best way to tell."

Now, it is up to anyone else to believe what they'd like. I'm simply here to speak of my experiences. And what I have experienced is this. I have nightmares every night, ever since I can remember. Sometimes these nightmares will have portions that just feel strange and bizarre, but I pay no mind to them. Though I started noticing something that turned from coiensidence to evidence over years of consistency. 

At times, I will be going about my life and then stumble into a situation I've seen before...In a dream...years before. This has happened over 100 times for me. And they are usually just simple but strange situations but without a doubt they are things that I have had dreams of years before. Of course it does no good to try and predict ahead because I never know which nightmares will end up being something in the future. But it is something to note.

AMA,f0mdqx4,t1_f0ggi83,1568742654.0,"I am definitely still here and will keep answering so long as there are things to answer! So thank you for your interest and for your question. There are many hallucinations that have given me that feeling. I have kept journals throughout my whole life, documenting the things I see and hear. I have at least 20 notebooks stuffed to the brim with them, as well as paintings and sketches. I do this to for a release but also to be able to give a tangible nature to the things I'm seeing. Typically the ones that scare me the most are the ones that I have not been able to stop drawing. They shook me so deep to my core that I sometimes have to go back and draw them again and again in attempts to get the visual of them out of my head but I cant. I could explain a few.

There was one I use to see a lot as a child. It was a creature made from human flesh. It was tall and thin, ribs protruding from its flesh. It had an elongated neck and very long, rail thin arms. Its fingers were long and skeletal with claws about the ends. It was tall, likely 7-8 foot but would hunch, creating a full curve in it's back that would bring it facing you at about 6 feet tall. Its head was daunting. If you could imagine a human head, taken off and rotted in a cave for hundreds of years. The skin of its face was practically mummified but thick with seams and wrinkles. Its jaw was always hung open with rowed teeth like a pirhanna, sharp and ready and always dripping with saliva. Its eyes were clouded and catarized. 

I believed it lived under the stairs in my family home and would hide in the basement. I believed it wanted to eat me. Since no one else could see it they called me a stupid child and told me to get over it, that it wasnt real. But it was real for me. I would hear it skittering through the walls, panting, breathing, sniffing to find me. I would see it out of the corner of my eye, watching it prowl into my room and slink under the bed. I would often find that I had slept walked down the lower level and find myself stood at the top of the stairs, staring down into the dark, watching that thing climb up the stairs, then up the wall, then it would let out this blood curdling scream and scramble across the ceiling after me.

I remember that one always shook me to my core. I saw it for years and it was the cause of many sleepless nights...

The others that would horrify me, straight to my core, would be the amount of corpses I would see. I find corpses are a constant hallucination of mine. But a certain category of them would always shatter my mental state on impact the second I saw them.

There was this once, I was in the entry halls of a train station in the city, trying to make my way through a crowd of people. And then suddenly saw a woman pushing through people, rushing toward me. She was screaming and covered in blood. She slammed straight into me, grasping my shoulders, screaming bloody murder straight into my face. She was grabbing me all over in desperation, smearing her blood across my face and neck and she did. She was begging for help, begging for me to save her. And then I heard a loud bang. I watched the light leave her eyes and felt her slump against me and collapse to the floor. I looked down. Ears ringing. Hands shaking. Covered in this womans blood, staring down at her lifeless body crumpled at my feet. And I just remember having an entire mental break down. I remember seeing the man who had shot her, screaming at everyone to run and dropping to my knees crying over this woman. Only to find out that none of it was real. Security ended up taking me from the station and holding me until they could figure out what was wrong with me and why the hell I was in hysterics over nothing.

Those sorts of them really shake me to my core."

It's like being a detective on a case but the case is your own mind and the tricks it plays and it will always been an ongoing investigation to try and figure out as much as I can about what I see and how to navigate it best. It's a lot of studying my own patterns and the patterns of the things I see and hear to be able to anticipate as much of it as I can in the day. So that I'm mentally prepared for what I might see or hear or feel, so that my reaction to it when it happens isnt so drastic. And so that it doesn't shock me as much as it would have if I wasnt expecting it. I hope that makes sense..

But yes, essentially its constant self reflection and trying to analyse everything I do end up seeing in case I can find a pattern and can find something that would help in the future.


I would say that it has made it impossible for me to live my life normally. I have had to change the way I go about every aspect of my life. So it does make quite a divided separation between me and everyone else. Which brings on a lot of isolation. But having lived this way for so long I've gotten use to the isolation, if that makes sense? It doesn't bother me so much that I will be alone for a lot of my life because I've always only ever had myself. 

The only interaction I get with people at the moment is through here and through a couple of trusted people like my partner and a couple of friends.

Sometimes they tell me tales of things they've done and mistakes they've made and warn me not to do the same. Sometimes I will be doing a task that I am doing incorrectly and they will comment and correct me, telling me how I could do it properly. Some of them speak in languages I do not know. I have learned bits of language from a few of them over the years. Things like that.

As for your second question, I dont believe I can. Though I haven't quite tried.. Interesting thought though! Maybe I will look into it. Though my answer as of right now would likely be no, I do not think I can intentionally make things appear for myself."
AMA,f0jvnsg,t1_f0fatxy,1568664112.0,"Thank you for your questions. It has been very lovely to exchange such genuine answers for your very intruiging questions. I am very glad to have spoken with you and that my words could have such an impact.

Yes, I agree. Those people just cant seem to grasp the concept that it is not personal and it is not of my, or anyone creation. It simply exists.

Thank you for genuinely brightening my day. I hope you have a good one as well."
AMA,f0jv7i7,t1_f0f4asu,1568663808.0,"Over the years I have found many ways to manage myself. I always have a mental process to prepare myself for the hallucinations I may encounter and I do my best to control my reactions and keep them at a minimum to avoid being thrown into panic about them. I write and sketch a lot of what I see and hear so that I can get it out of my mind and onto paper. This helps me process things better because I have tangible proof of what I've witnessed and it is also useful to show others what I might be experiencing. There are many tips and tricks I've found to make it through the day.

Yes, I do live with someone off an on. One of my partners comes to visit me and will often stay at the house. It is helpful to have someone around that can help me ground in reality a bit more than when I'm alone.

I have a overbearing feeling of uneasiness about VR. I have seen the damage it can do to a normal mind when used improperly and it has made me very cautious to the devices. I, myself, have never tried VR. I believe it would not sit well with my conditions and could very well result in a psychotic break for me. So I'd say that I have plans to stay well away from it but I would be curious to see what it does for others, if they were comfortable and were to try it."
AMA,f0juneq,t1_f0evkb5,1568663436.0,"They attack me verbally, berating me on anything about myself that they can tear apart; my self image, my decisions, my reactions to things, my emotions, etc. They will do things like flick through my memories and flash images into my head of past trauma and abuse and pick out everything that I did wrong and blame me excessively for what happened, calling me weak and worthless and telling me awful things about myself.

At times I can physically feel them as well. They will give me sensations of hands all over me in inappropriate, triggering manners. They will scratch and claw and bite. Sometimes I can feel them breathe down my neck and whisper into my ear such awful things.

I have always wondered what it would be like to speak to a Shaman and I would like to very much if I ever had the chance, though I'm not sure I could ever afford to fly to one."
AMA,f0ju68t,t1_f0f2bzc,1568663120.0,"I see a wide variety of people. At times they are entirely black, featureless outlines. Shadow people, as I've heard them called before. Sometimes they will simply seem like any other person to me. Sometimes they take the shape of past abusers. Sometimes they are corpse-like with pale dead flesh and rotting portions of their bodies. Sometimes they seem contorted and wrong...as if someone too the image of a human and warped it. Like an excessively large smile or a longer throat than possible, or rail thin and very tall. 

They can also have levels of transparency. Though most of the time they are as opaque and vivid as anyone else I could look at. Sometimes they have a see-through quality to them. Sometimes I can hardly make them out. 

They talk about anything and everything. The topics range. Some of them speak in different languages and talk back and forth. Some talk to themselves. Some talk to an absent audience, like they are reporting the news or on the radio. There are some that watch what I do and comment on how I am doing something or what I might be doing, giving their opinions on it or criticising my way of doing it. So, I have a lot of conversations with them about whatever I'm doing usually. 

Sometimes they ramble on about things I have nothing to do with and I listen and sympathize. Sometimes they explain things and tell me stories of things that they have done to try and teach me lessons from their mistakes. Sometimes I can get their opinions on decisions I need to make. We talk about anything that comes up really.

It is quite alright to ask questions! It is always a pleasure for me to explain anything to anyone who would like to know. It's nice to be able to talk to people about this because it isnt something I usually get to speak of. So please do feel free to ask anything you'd please. There isnt anything I wont answer.

Thank you for your questions"
AMA,f0f0hs7,t1_f0eyuua,1568576204.0,"Tonic Immobility is something that victims of rape or sexual abuse can develop. It is where the subject is triggered into an immobile state, blanking out their mind, making them unable to move or react and essentially numbs them to the abuse their mind feels is about to be enacted on them."
AMA,f0f01u2,t1_f0eufx3,1568576032.0,"Some of them do. Those I am very thankful for. There are drastically more cruel entities populating the majority of it, but there are a handful that are kind and I would consider very close to me. And yes, there are some that do exactly as you mentioned. I have had times where a mass of vile ones will be going at me, shouting and screaming at me, being cruel and rude and then one will interject them, trying to calm me. Sometimes they even shout at each other (the ones trying to soothe me and the ones tearing me down). They do say things like you mentioned and at times I can feel them stroking my hair or holding me in the midst of it all."
AMA,f0ezm3s,t1_f0eqnak,1568575846.0,"If it is at a transparency where I can stick my hand into it, most times I can still see my hand itself and it's as if the figure has become fainter and less defined. At that point I would see nothing but the thin layered projection of a person and the overlay of my hand being in the middle of them.

Though, there is the rare time where I could stick a hand in their chest and all I can see is my wrist and their chest and I have no visual of where my hand might be inside of them. Usually the dark and twisted ones like to grin at me and make nasty remarks if I do something like this.

I had something I use to do, back when I was younger, with a lot of them. If one of them scared me and they wouldn't go away I would buck up and walk straight through them. Most of the time it would make them become transparent as I went through. Half of the time they would slowly regain opacity, the other half they would disappear entirely. I would say, as for what's inside of them... Its like walking through smoke or fog that's tinted with the colours of a person. Pale haze for pale flesh and green haze for a green coloured shirt, or denim for jeans. I definitely haven't stuck my head in one but maybe I should try that some day... It mostly seems to me like they are a hologram type thing, a projection on smoke that moves and reforms and changes shape. I hope that describes it well. 

As for the screen thing, yes. I had this a lot when I was younger where someone on the screen would turn and talk to me, or crawl out of the television. At times I will see something in a film and mention it to someone only to realize it wasnt actually in there and it was simply my overlay that I observed. It makes everything very distorted when watching things.

Thank you for your questions. I always enjoy answering such interesting and thought provoking questions. It is never a bother and you are always welcome to ask as many as you please."
AMA,f0eyaiq,t1_f0eo9r4,1568575266.0,"I think, if you feel able to, it may help to write about it or try to track it, like you said. If you do end up doing this I would be curious to know what you discover if you do ever feel like talking to someone about it. I understand your situation with not being able to afford therapy. I am currently unable to go to my appointments as well due to costs. I would say the best that people like us can do is to try our best to find ways to manage it ourselves and find other people who experience similar things that we can relate to and find some comfort. I hope for the best for you. My messages are open if you ever feel like sharing your experiences with it with someone who might understand. Thank you for sharing."
AMA,f0eo7yi,t1_f0ejhk9,1568571102.0,"I have found there are various reactions that happen when I try to touch them. If I am in a delirious state, such as when I have been hallucinating intensely and have disconnected very far from this reality, I can feel them. At times, these interactions will be when I am laid out (and usually losing consciousness) and I have my hand  idle or outstretched -  I can see a hand reaching to take mine and I can feel it grasp me. And I can squeeze back. Sometimes if I am going down a hall in the dark I feel as if my hand is being held by something and pulled along. I can feel fur beneath my fingers when I hallucinate animals. I can also lift things I am hallucinating and it will feel as if I am actually holding them.

But sometimes, when my awareness is more here than in the delusions, when I reach for something my hand will go right through. Like an object or a person or an animal. 

So it really can go both ways."
AMA,f0emufs,t1_f0ej3w7,1568570604.0,"Hm. That is very interesting. I would say you are definitely experiencing hallucinations. Though I am not aware of what might be the cause, I can validate that hallucinations would fit the bill of what you are seeing. Melatonin is an excellent sleep aid. I use it myself. I haven't found many side effects from it so I'm unsure if that would be a contributing factor. Though insomnia does bring about some wild effects, I can definitely sympathize with you on that.

Have you thought of writing about these occurrences? Sometimes I find that when I take notes on hallucinations, I can find a pattern and therefore find something that might be triggering it or something that may soothe it. Does it bother you quite a lot or have you gotten use to it? Does it happen frequently?

I wonder if it could be something a therapist could advise you on, if you would be interested in seeking out more about it."
AMA,f0em0ss,t1_f0eisqk,1568570296.0,"I see what you mean. I'm glad that seems to work for you. I have tried many things to escape them or make it stop. I've found that having headphones in very loud can help sometimes when it's a lot of noise from every direction, though it doesn't drown it out...because it's coming from within and I can still hear it. But it does help to muffle everything and shift my focus to something other than what they are saying, which helps.

I have tried repeating mantra's when it's bad, but then they just repeat back my words and mock me and that makes it worse. Or they will talk at the same time as I am speaking and it will make me say the words all wrong and then I'll get frustrated and resort to shouting at them.

Sometimes the shouting really does help. Just letting that anger become external and to direct it at them. Essentially fighting back at them, standing up for myself, tends to relieve some of the stress of it.

Sometimes writing out everything they are saying helps, scrawling it across page after page or all over my skin. Tends to get some of the pent up tension out to the point where I can regain control of myself.

As to why they are there, I'm not sure. Medical professionals say it's something in the brain. Spiritually oriented people say its ""seeing the veil"", essentially seeing spirits and things. I've had religious folk say that I am cursed and able to see demons or something. I'm not sure why it happens but I've found I have to simply accept it as my reality and my life and just try to make the best I can of the circumstances I'm in.

They are almost always serious, dark natured or disturbing. Sometimes the auditory will be completely random though, like having a radio constantly on inside your skull, switching channels on it's own. I dont have many ridiculous hallucinations though I do try to find humor in them if I can. Like laughing at the creepy man crouched on top of my fridge so that it doesn't feel so horrifying."

AMA,f0eh950,t1_f0egj07,1568568390.0,"It depends on which ones it is. There are a handful that I do feel very safe with and comforted by. Because I have seen/heard them for many years and they have often kept me company and consoled me in harder times. 

Besides the ones I am acquainted with, there are polite voices that I dont mind listening or speaking to. But the majority are rather cruel and I do my best to ignore them. Though, when there are too many or they are being too cruel I do tend to get overwhelmed and during my panic attacks I do tend to shout at them. Mostly begging them to stop.

I see what you mean with the second question! Though, as crazy as it sounds, I dont see them as a part of me. They are all very distinctly not my own voice and have information and pasts that I definitely have no experience with.

AMA,f0egirk,t1_f0eft11,1568568056.0,"Yes, I do hallucinate all of the time, and at night as well. What you experience could be a hallucination, though it does not have to be schizophrenia specifically so I wouldn't let yourself panic about that just yet. Do these always happen at night? Or do they happen in the day as well? If you dont mind me asking, what is it like when it does happen? Maybe I could help identify what it might be for you."
AMA,f0eg5yk,t1_f0efge7,1568567889.0,"Since there aren't really people out there to help train you on how to deal with this, it's a lot about finding your own way to handle things and prepare yourself for what you will encounter.

I have tried ignoring them, but the amount that I interact with them doesn't seem to change anything about the frequency or the content of the hallucination. So, I gave up on trying to completely ignore them and now only ignore the ones I feel I can safely ignore. If one addresses me specifically, I find it hard to ignore them and eventually end up talking to them. Some have full conversations with me, some simply comment on what I'm doing, some talk about their own subjects and I listen and acknowledge as if I were simply on the phone with them rather than hallucinating them."
AMA,f0ed6z7,t1_f0eb05z,1568566490.0,"I would say that patience and understanding is the key. Asking what you mentioned above would be very beneficial. It would help me to keep track of what has been real and what hasn't. It would give me releif to have a checkpoint to reference and relax knowing that the things I experienced between were simply delusions.

Something that really helps that I haven't found with many people is simply understanding, and allowing me to explain what I've seen. For instance, if you were to tell me ""We last spoke yesterday, about plans while we were having lunch."" I would then be able to realize that the argument we had at night at my front door was a hallucination. It would give me relief to know it wasnt real. But it would give me even more relief to be able to tell you and say, ""Oh I'm so glad that's where we are at. I had a hallucination last night that you knocked on my door and we argued. I'm really glad that didnt happen. I would never want to cause that tension between us."" And have you listen and respond with something like, ""Oh! That must have been rough. I promise that didnt happen. How are you feeling?"" And I would say that I felt okay now. Now that I know it wasnt real and I've expressed what I've experienced and the other person had understood and we can move along easily with our day.

So many times I have told people (who knew about my schizophrenia) and they were mad that I hallucinated them in a bad light. When, I'm not the one who controls what I see and it hurts me as much as it would hurt them too. As long as I had someone who could understand that I dont choose what I see and who could update me on when we last spoke I think we would get along just fine.

Thank you for asking, this was nice to explain. Nice to know that someone would want to know how to handle something like this. Thank you for your interest."

AMA,f0e9abk,t1_f0du7lp,1568564973.0,"It's mostly something you realize over a period of time. Typically the process I go through with an everyday hallucination would be like this: Say I go into my living room, when I enter there is a man in the corner. He's tall and lanky and staring at me. I stop and look him over. Is he someone I recognize? No. Okay. Is the hall door open to the room? No. If he would have broken in he wouldn't have shut the door behind him. Okay. Is the cat reacting to him? No. The cat is sprawled on the couch and doesn't look at all concerned. Okay. All signs so far point to this being a hallucination. Now next, I would either try speaking to him, throwing something light to see if it goes through him, or take a picture. If hes not in the picture, hes a hallucination. If the object goes through him, hes a hallucination. The speaking to him could go either way.

So basically I have to go through a sort of ""process of elimination"" to figure out if something is real or not and if it is a threat to be reacted to or simply a mind trick I have to try and ignore. Because it could be fatal if I make a mistake and someone ends up being a real intruder and I dont react properly."
AMA,f0e7mfu,t1_f0dpz0p,1568564275.0,"I have auditory and visual hallucinations throughout each and every day. Yes, I do hear voices. The only way to manage it really is to force yourself to grow accustomed to it and try to anticipate/expect as much as you can. I have to mentally prepare myself for the things I might see to keep my reactions to them under control. I can do this pretty well now but I will admit that there is always something that will catch me off guard and throw my focus and then I start spinning out and everything else is harder to hold back my reactions from and I end up in a panic. Something that really helps is writing out and sketching everything I see and hear. It gives me a journal to reference to remind myself that I have dealt with something like this before and I can do it again."
AMA,f0e6uag,t1_f0e5flw,1568563967.0,"Yes. This is a very deep fear of mine that has followed me my entire life. I lost any friends that I did have because of things like this. Partners as well. Constantly trying to check if someone is real is really hard and often turns into them hating you for it. Especially because they think it is you invalidating their existence when it isnt that at all. I would often hallucinate vivid arguments with people where they said awful things, or we said awful things to one another. And then when I see them again, I'm never sure if the argument was real or hallucinate. They get mad at me for being upset. And then they leave. 

I was with someone for awhile in high school, at least a month, before I figured out that no one else knew they existed. Turns out they were a hallucination. 

One of the many reasons I have very real trust issues and deep issues with derealization."
AMA,f0e5yrq,t1_f0e0te2,1568563621.0,"When I use to take them (which I dont, currently) they would change the voices. They would muffle the constant noise into a massive static cloud. So rather than hearing clear voices I was hearing a mass of overwhelming sound that made no sense at all. And the times that any clear audio or visual would break through, it would be sharper and more powerful than my regular hallucinations and would put me into a state of shock, unable to pull myself from the paralyzing panic. 

I was taken off the medications when they determined it was more of a threat to my sanity/mental state than it was helping anything. So yes, when I did take them it would make me very upset. With a lifetime of dealing with these hallucinations, I've found a sort of rhythm with most of it. When a medication changes that, the shock is too much to handle."
AMA,f0e5g9p,t1_f0e07r6,1568563415.0,"That idea is a theory that some people believe in.

I take medications for other things, like sleeping and reducing anxiety. However, they dont effect my hallucinations. I've had to learn to cope with those."

Or I will be sat at my desk and feel a tap on my shoulder only to turn as see no one. Sometimes I feel a fingernail trail down my spine. I wouldn't say I've experienced any ""private"" things in the way you are likely thinking. But in a positive, I suppose, I have felt arms around me before. Those are often a comfort. In a negative, I can sometimes hallucinate traumatic experiences from my past happening to me again, and yes, I can feel those too. Which are rather unpleasant..."

Oh, and when they show someone typing. And they are clickity clacking all across on random keys that dont match AT ALL to what they are typing on screen. I.e. 30 loud clicks all across the keyboard to type ""see you later"".

AMA,f05wz2z,t1_f03ix0j,1568422193.0,"Yes. I have had nightmares of that nature quite a lot all throughout my life. I would have them in childhood, of the same house, the same bad the same room, the same everything except something awful would be different. Such as the family being brutally slain and in their beds, or blood trailing down the hall, or a man standing in the doorway of the room. I would always wake horrified, screaming, telling family I thought they were dead or refusing to believe that there wasnt actually someone else in the house.

I would have ones in teen years of going to school, I'd experience a whole day there as if it were normal, then something would happen...Like a bomb going off, or a school shooting, or a fire. I'd watch countless peers die and then wake up in bed and realise I hadn't even gone to school yet. It was hard to believe anything was real my entire life.

I still have those sorts of dreams even now. Sometimes I walk around my house so far on edge, as if I'm walking on eggshells because I just feel like something awful is going to happen. I'm often very unsure which reality is real most of the time. And I never quite know if I'm actually dreaming."

AMA,f05wd4s,t1_f03gsu5,1568421672.0,"I am sorry to hear that. I wish you the best, from one of us to another. I haven't found many things that effect the nightmares themselves but I have found things that help my approach to them. Writing them down helps me more than anything. It helps you release it somewhere without needing someone to tell the nightmare to. It also helps empty it out of your head so that you dont have to work so hard to hold it in your mind throughout the day. Once it's on paper you can tell yourself to forget about it, because it will be recorded there and you dont have to replay it in your mind to remember it. Recording the nightmares also helps me to reflect on them, flick back through, find patterns and make it sort of like a self-study, analysing what your mind uses to try and scare you. It helps me get a leg up on the nightmares and feel less afraid of them when I wake up. It makes me feel more like I've just got another clue and I must go write it down. I take it on as if I am studying a wild animal and its behaviours, though it really is me studying my own mind, I like to think of it as a separate entity. It helps me a lot. Another thing that's good for release is art. Draw, paint, sketch, scribble down whatever things frightened from your nightmare. It helps to give them a physicality out here and makes the subject seem less ""unknown"" and ""unseen"" when your mind is frightened of it. 
I hope some of this can help. Feel free to contact any time if you would like me to explain any more of this. Best of luck."

Now, I know that sounds awful, but hear me out. My nightmares often consist of people dying, being tortured, murdered, in pain. But this dream, I didnt see it happen. They had been in an accident and I was at their grave. When I began to cry, I felt a hand touch mine. Upon looking up I could see the faint outline of them, as if they were a spirit or something, crouched in front of me on top of the fresh soil of their grave. They spoke to me and told me that everything was alright. That they were free now. That they could leave their broken body and find a new life, as something new, maybe an animal or a plant, or a human far away in places hey had never seen. They comforted me and consoled me and I got to see them and speak to them and know that they would truly be alright. I wept and we held each other in a vague embrace before someone came up behind me, asking if I was alright... When I turned to look at them, the spirit had vanished. I remember simply smiling and nodding with tears streaking down my face. I stood and that man put his arm around me and we walked away from the gravestone. It was one of the only dreams that left me with a sense of peace rather than fear and devastation..."
AMA,f05uly4,t1_f042380,1568420165.0,Not sure what you mean by this. Could you rephrase so that maybe I can understand?
AMA,f05uksc,t1_f05b968,1568420138.0,"Hm. Interesting question. I would say the only thing I can count as a ""good"" thing to come out of this is that I am not as afraid as I use to be of dying. In my years of nightmares I have experienced death by so many methods that felt so real to me that I no longer wonder what dying in that way would feel like. Because I have a sort of gauge of how it would be. Having experienced it already makes me fear it less. So, in turn it has granted me a little relief of knowing what to expect when the time does come.

Also, I tend to journal as many nightmares as possible and I always have. I write a lot and often use inspiration from some of my nightmares to write horror or psychological thrillers. I hope that someday maybe I could publish something and make all of this at least worth it to someone.

The worst thing is probably the torment. Having to go to sleep every night knowing you may be tortured or sawn in half or defiled. It's a hard thing to keep doing every night and it really wears you down inside."
AMA,f05u7kt,t1_f05prja,1568419819.0,"Sounds like another type of hell. I'm sorry you have to experience that. I wouldn't wish what I go through upon anyone but I do hope that someday you can find something that allows you to dream again.

Have you ever dreamt? If you dont mind me asking. Did it cease at some point or had it never begun?"
AMA,f05u3yg,t1_f05pyc1,1568419734.0,"I have not seen him. I was never a fan and dont find him particularly frightening. Maybe it's because I live the real thing and often found that my simple nightmares were more horrifying than what I'd seen on the screen. 

I dont often have any recognizable figures in my dreams (besides past abusers and trauma inflictors) but I will say that I have had several dreams involving Jeffrey Dahmer and a brief appearance of Bundy. Though, this was likely due to the fact that I was enrolled in Forensics and Psychology courses at the time and had been studying them for an article I was writing."
AMA,f05ttpn,t1_f05s5wb,1568419495.0,"I have gone to many different therapists, psychologists and specialists in my life for many things, including this. The consensus I've gathered from them is that Nightmare disorder itself, cannot be cured and there are not common treatments to my knowledge. They merely suggest working on different disorders of mine to lessen the stress that the nightmares bring me throughout the day. I have yet to find something that helps with it though I hope to some day."
AMA,f059yfl,t1_f044388,1568405100.0,"Night terrors, from my research seem to have more physical reactions while the individual is asleep - they will kick and hit, or can even stand and walk, punch or struggle against someone (not all cases, but it does happen). Often times with Night Terrors the individual will not remember what the subject was of their terror and will not remember what they did (physically reacting). 

Someone with nightmare disorder will have intense vivid nightmares every night. They will not always react physically, though they can at times. People with the disorder remember the nightmares and are often haunted by them and affected mentally and emotionally throughout the day by them.

This is just what I know from personal experience and my own research of the two. I hope this helps."
AMA,f059fc8,t1_f04y8zf,1568404745.0,"There are similar subjects that have come up in a variety of nightmares over the years. Often it seems to be mostly psychological, trauma related, flashback related, being tortured or killed, other various things of the sort and sometimes completely random."
AMA,f058fb4,t1_f056dxr,1568404210.0,"Sorry to hear that. So far there aren't any medications or treatments that I know of to help the disorder. What I've been told by specialists that I've seen is that it isnt really something curable, but you can treat the side effects of it - such as taking certain sleep aid medications to ensure that you do sleep rather than becoming an insomniac from hesitation to experience the nightmares. And taking appropriate anxiety medications to assist with the impact the nightmares have throughout the day after waking. I hope that she can find something that helps though."
AMA,f055cu8,t1_f03e2eg,1568402711.0,"Last night, my nightmare began with me preparing for work. As I was getting ready, my family (who I dont live with currently) offered to give me a ride there. I accepted. During the car ride I began to notice they were taking streets and turnings that I did not recognized. When I brought this to their attention they said, ""You wont be going to work today."" When I asked where they were taking me they wouldn't answer.

We arrived at a large white building, its snowing outside and I'm not wearing enough to keep warm. I go to bring my bag and jacket as they get out of the car but they take them from me. I ask for them back, but they shut my things in the car and lock it. My mother walks me to the door. My grandparents watch, stood outside of the car, my sibling wont even look at me.

My mother takes me inside and immediately two security officers in black come to seize me. I begin resisting, then fighting, demanding to know who they are and why they are taking me. Everyone just keeps telling me it's ""for my own good"". My mother scolds me as I begin to shout at her to do something. Her heartless expression. She doesn't care. I begin to fight harder, kicking and screaming until I feel something sharp in my neck and the world goes black.

I wake sometime later, naked and on a cold white floor in a blank white room. There is a folded shirt and pants stacked in front of me. Unaware of where I am or what's going on, I scramble to put them on, shaking like a leaf. I reach to my head and find that all of my hair has been shaved off. There is a lump on my neck from the sedative injection site.

Everything is distorted and twisted. I remember people coming in and out, telling me things, shouting when I didnt respond, hitting me over the head and locking me back up again. Eventually someone came to take me out. They passed me off from person to person until a bald man in casual uniform was the only one in my company. He took me by the arm and lead me to a back room. It was filled with old supplies and stock, decrepit and falling apart. He told me this is where the shower was. I listened, followed. 

He got to a door and unlocked it. Inside looked to be just a dirty bathroom, though upon approaching I could see a shower further within it. I went to step into the room but was confused when he came in too. I hesitated, not wanting to get undressed in front of him. He kept looking at me like he was hungry. He told me there was a bathroom attached to the room as well and he just needed to use it. 

I wasnt sure what to do. I told him he could go first but he wouldn't. Then he came up with a different reason, ""You don't really think we could leave you alone for that, did you? What with all of the suicides in here? Cant have you slittin' you're wrist, bleedin' all over. I gotta watch you.""

I'll spare the details of the next portion...But I was forced to shower. He did watch. And he forced himself on me in the shower. 

The nightmare lasted months of being in that institution. Up until the day I was released, and my family coming to get me, screaming at me when I was freaking out about leaving, dragging me along, back into the car and riding me back home...it was now autumn. 8 months had passed."
AMA,f051lpu,t1_f03dawm,1568400660.0,"I have responded to several questions, giving my recounts of several of my ""worsts"", if you would like to read them I can link you to the comment. Thank you for your question."
AMA,f051ihb,t1_f03d3bs,1568400598.0,"I have responded to another comment explaining my situation with lucid dreaming but here is the summary: I have tried for years to learn how to induce lucid dreaming, I have never been able to force it to happen. I have, however, unintentionally had lucid dreams. In these dreams I cannot change anything, the only thing that is different is that I am aware that I am dreaming or aware that it is not reality that I am experiencing. The dreams are still nightmares and the lucid state doesn't seem to change that. Most times, the realization that it is a dream with force me from the dream and make me wake up, even if I were to try and fight it. However, several times I have had the realization that it was a dream and been unable to leave, unable to make myself wake up, and I end up trapped and screaming to be released."
AMA,f04ztkx,t1_f0385ov,1568399456.0,"Yes, I do. A lot of my previous partners were very irritated with me for my sleeping habits. They would get aggravated when I wouldn't come to bed and would often abuse me when I would wake them with my screaming or sweating or shaking.

My current parnter is very understanding about it. He has spent many nights comforting me when I wake up crying or screaming. And is excellent at calming me and holding me, helping me realise where I am and what's going on. I am very thankful for his presence.

Most times though, I do sleep alone. To spare him from it and to keep myself from experiencing triggers by being in a bed with another person. Again, he is always understanding of this."
AMA,f04z4yt,t1_f032u14,1568399001.0,"There are different kinds of scary in my eyes. There are the ones that traumatized you psychologically, ones that rip your heart out emotionally and fuck you up for days on in, and ones of general horror that induce an incessant fear.

I would say one that particularly horrified me was being strapped down to an operation table in a dirty room and being paralyzed, unable to move but unanesthetitized and able to feel everything as I was brutally taken apart piece my piece. Blood drained, skin removed, muscles taken out, sawing through bones, amputation, crushing my ribcage, being put on drains and hooked up to compressors and machines. All the while the ""operators"" faces would melt and change, flesh would hang off their cheeks with their teeth exposed, they would bleed on me and cackle in my face, they would sing and scream and morph into daunting twisted expressions. It felt like it lasted for an eternity. Until I was nothing. Until I woke up screaming bloody murder 6 hours later, sweated through my clothes and sheets unable to stop shaking all day."
AMA,f04te9k,t1_f04r9t3,1568395188.0,"I've covered this in a different reply but yes, I have tried smoking. It seems to help with the paranoia of falling asleep but I still continue to have nightmares when I go under. Also, it makes my hallucinations upon waking up in the night a lot more vivid. Which is sometimes chaos for me (schizo).

And yes, I have over the years found a lot of my experiences in nightmares very exciting when I am able to separate myself from the horror of it. It is a rush when it doesn't attack me deeply. So, at times, yes."
AMA,f04t4wo,t1_f04plz6,1568395017.0,"It depends on the type. Some of them, once the snap me awake there is no way of getting back to sleep and I usually have to stay awake the rest of the night. Some of them, no matter how hard I try to stay awake, will continuously pull me back under for hours and hours. It's a toss up on which is worse."
AMA,f04424e,t1_f03zouf,1568379106.0,"I tried it for a really long time. I got to the point where I needed it to even consider sleeping. Even though it didnt change my nightmares, it took away the paranoia of falling asleep. And though it did make my hallucinations more vivid when I was awake (schizo) it was sometimes better to have that sharp break from reality and just let myself not care about trying to be sane for a moment."
AMA,f043uli,t1_f03wq53,1568378952.0,"I was smoking before bed for awhile and it helped immensely with calming the fear of going to sleep, though I found that my nightmares still persisted, at times being more vivid than when I hadn't smoked. And when I would wake up intermittently, I would find that my hallucinations of my surroundings would be drastically more intense and sometimes very frightening. 

I wish I could find a milder way to get an effect that would balance me properly."
AMA,f043lxg,t1_f02yh8z,1568378773.0,"Yes. When I was younger I would often times refuse to go to sleep. The family would insist on it and I would hide, awake for the whole night until morning. Most times I would be hallucinating so that would keep me awake as well (seeing things in the room while I would try to sleep). In teen and adult years I have developed insomnia, often not sleeping for days until my body physically forces me do. I had been doing a bit better but in the past two weeks I haven't gotten the best sleep, often just a couple of hours in the morning and then I go about my day. I'm exhausted but I haven't found anything to help it."
AMA,f043c03,t1_f0325r5,1568378572.0,"I have tried for any years with loads of different techniques to induce lucid dreaming for myself. I can never seem to make it happen, though needless to say it had happened on accident. During those episodes of lucid dreaming, however, I was not able to change the dream. In several, the realization that it was a dream woke me up from it. In very few, I had the realization and was able to stay under, deciding what to do in the dream. Several times it happened where I had the realization and was thereafter trapped within the nightmare, screaming at myself to wake up though I couldn't seem to."

AMA,f02xbaa,t1_f02vnip,1568340083.0,Thank you. I wish the best for you as well. I hope that we both can find some healing to patch up our souls.
AMA,f02x42k,t1_f02vou3,1568339971.0,"Well, I can get any sort of nightmare in any state I'm in. Could be one that shocks me and sticks with me even when I had been feeling fine before hand. But typically they are very realistic and simply set in a life that isnt mine, though I am living as whoever it is I am seeing through the eyes of. 

I would say some of the most traumatic are ones such as what I just mentioned. I am someone else, in their body, their life, and something awful happens. I have had multiple where whoever I was watched their loved ones being murdered or committing suicide. It feels real. It feels like my reality. And then I wake up here and I simply cry and cry and are unable to accept that it was a nightmare, that this is in fact my life and that that wasnt really happening to me.

Others that get to me are ones that last for extended periods of time. I have had many nightmares that, within the nightmare, I lived years. Years of life in some other place with some other context of reality. And then waking to find out that here, this life, was meant to be mine and that those years of life didnt actually happen. And that it had only been 8 or so hours out here when I had experienced so much life there. And having to readjust to reality after that...it takes a severe toll.

Though there are a lot of nightmares that are less long-term and more shock-value gore oriented. Like the many ways of people being tortured, watching torture, experiencing torture. Nightmares where I am killed in various ways. Nightmares where the scenario restarts when I am killed and every time I try to do something different to survive I end up being killed in other various ways and having to do that over and over until I am woken up. 

I could go on, but I'll stop there.

As for least scary, I would say the few that I dont find as horrifying are the rare few where I find a strange bode of confidence and stride through the horror without a care, reacting in the way I wish I could react to all of them with; careless badassery. But those are very few and far between."
