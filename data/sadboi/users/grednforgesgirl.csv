Essentially leading to people, who are in extremely poor regions and depend on growing their own food to eat, now need to purchase seeds again and again in order to keep eating, rather than collecting seeds from the previous harvest. It's exploiting people as a cash grab, in the same line of the way they did years ago where they sold baby formula to poor new mothers in Africa, and then when the formula ran out their milk had already dried up, so they had no other choice than to purchase more formula or watch their babies starve. It's just exploitation of people who don't have a whole lot of other options. Create the problem to sell the solution. It's despicable"

FragileMaleRedditor,fp0fkg4,t1_fp0drw9,1588208292.0,"I didn't describe her as a lesbian, I just said she was hella gay. And then I said that lots of lesbians have biological children. (Sry for miscommunication)I know of at least two or three that I know of personally. Sometimes people don't figure out they're a lesbian until later in life, or sometimes they just have kids because they want to have kids, and historically labels were a lot looser back then. Lesbians had relationships with men, too, at the bare minimum just to procreate. Like, it's not unheard of. I think maybe it only feels wrong to you because there's not a lot of LGBT representation in mainstream media, and a hookup with someone of the opposite sex is normally used to discredit a person's sexuality. However outside of entertainment, it's pretty common for people who identify as lesbians to not be ""gold star"" lesbians and have children from opposite sex relationships."

They kill black people indiscriminately without trial judge or jury. This isn't just a case of ""a few bad apples spoil the bunch,"" in America, their only purpose has been since their inception, first to capture runaway slaves, then to enforce Jim Crow laws, including turning a blind eye to lynching, now to kill and imprison as many black people as they can legally get away with. They enforce these racial ""rules"" of american society without ever questioning *why* or even worse yet, they know exactly why, and are racist so they agree with it. They are an open wound that reinforces the racial status quo of society, ""keeping black people in their place,"" are an extended hand of the KKK, gangs, and old racist white men (including politicians) who think things should go back to the way they were (as close to slavery as they can get). They are an enforcement of the private prison system, which has a say in how the laws are made and enforced because they buy off politicians, and serves to get as many people as possible in prison, which of course is as many black people as possible, and then turn around and use those prisoners as cheap labor, including, disgustingly, tending to old plantations and governor's mansions and being servants and tending fields, especially in the deep South. And all of it 100% legal. Police do not exist to serve the people, that is a clever line for white people who don't want to think deeper than a surface level, and some cops buy into this, but eventually they find out how things really are in the system, and either buy into it or quit. Police ONLY exist to serve and enforce the racial status quo in america, a status quo that is hundreds of years old. It disgusts me on an extremely deep level. THAT is why I say ACAB. Anyone who thinks otherwise about it is a fool with blinders on, which is how the racists in power want it.
