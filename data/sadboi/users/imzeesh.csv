I do agree there, but it goes back to the capitalistic framework we exist in. And to be honest, it shows how gloriously the system is failing (not here, but across the countries)."

We here face a different kind of situation, because some people are unwilling to stay at homes not because they can't, but because of religious reasons. They continue to attend gatherings, despite government restrictions. A large number was tested positive recently."

Also, it was a sad end to Inzamam's ODI career (he was given a test farewell, later on, I remember). I am not exactly sure what happened, but it made me fall in love with cricket too, in general.
