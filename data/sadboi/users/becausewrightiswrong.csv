I feel like people ignore his flaws a lot because he's the hero. Harry can be VICIOUS when he wants to be. He set an owl on his best friends until they bled for goodness sake, and never apologized. He was pleased to see a classmate of his still suffered mutilation on her face even months after the curse. He didn't know sectumsempra could kill Malfoy, and he certainly was horrified and tried to help reverse the damage, but when all was said and done his first next thought was to hide the book containing a deadly curse and attempt to avoid all responsibility. I detest Snape's teaching skills, but Harry hiding Sectumsempra and trying to lie his way out of it is possibly the only time I agreed with him chewing Harry out.

 He is a lovely person 90% of the time, but if you set him off, he will absolutely wreck you and what's more, he literally will not feel guilty because he feels he's justified in doing so. Harry yelling something awful and horrific at his son in a moment of anger and then working for the rest of the book to get his son back is absolutely in character in my opinion.

Idk. Maybe I'm wrong and it was character assassination. But to me, and my interpretation of the novels, Harry has had enough moments of being an abusive jerk at times for me to believe he would also have moments of being an abusive jerk in Cursed Child. And that doesn't make it okay: please don't think I'm trying to excuse his behaviour. But to me my favourite thing about Harry is that he isn't a perfect protagonist, and sometimes he flat-out is a really horrible person. He didn't become the Chosen One because he's good or kind, he was the Chosen One because of his birthday. I can see why some people find his behaviour in CC to be really upsetting, but to me, it seems like a realistic, if unwanted, way for his character to go: that Harry HAS always had issues with his temper, that he never learnt to properly cope with that, and as a result he hurts his son likely irreversibly: even when he and Albus make up, that is something Albus will likely always have in the back of his mind.

Harry is a good person. But good people aren't black and white. They can also have issues controlling their temper, lash out, say awful things, and have times when they are shitty parents. And personally I like seeing that in a protagonist. It doesn't justify Harry's behaviour and the abusive thing he said to Albus in the heat of the moment, but as a reader, I feel that looking deep into the darkest parts of Harry's personality makes him a better character. Not necessarily a better parent. But a better character. And I don't read fictional books for the parenting lessons."

I think this is what gets me about that tweet. I can understand if they don't understand, but at this point multiple mixed people have told them why that's offensive, and they're refusing to listen.

mixedrace,fo0fd72,t3_g4zbfv,1587412118.0,"Yeah, they're right that race is based on appearance. They've missed the point though. Sociologists state that race doesn't exist because to categorise someone based on their appearance is wrong. It is their ethnicity-their family, language and culture-that defines who they are. Classing someone as white just because they look white is completely overlooking the fact that race was a concept made up by human beings.

Just think of race being like gender stereotypes. People look at babies at birth and say ""you look THIS way, therefore I am going to call you by THESE words and you must play with THESE toys and you must act in THIS way"". Gender is another thing humans made up to put people into boxes: it doesn't naturally exist.

The entire concept of race not existing is designed to ease out of labelling someone based off of what they look like, not barge straight back into it again.

That theory literally took me years to get to grips with so if it doesn't make sense to you, the other argument against that tweet is that nobody can tell someone with people of colour in their recent generations how to identify and nobody else has the right to barge in and tell you to use certain word to describe themselves for their own convenience. This is the same mindset that lets people think they can call bisexual people straight for dating someone of the opposite gender. How someone looks or acts doesn't define their DNA, culture, or family."

harrypotter,fmsel3k,t3_fwvwyx,1586353822.0,"* Marietta Edgecombe did not deserve what happened to her. I'm not denying that she fucked up tremendously and made a mistake that put everyone in danger, and I 100% agree that Hermione was right to put a spell on the parchment to prevent anyone from spilling the existence of the DA, which would have put all of its members in danger. That isn't what Hermione did. Hermione cast a spell that *punished* the traitor, permanently, *after* they had spilt the beans. There are a multitude of spells Hermione could have used that, you know, *stopped the traitor snitching* ***in the first place*****,** but she chose not to use these. And I don't believe for a second it's because she didn't realize she could have cast these spells; she's too smart for that. I think Hermione's jinx shows that, given the choice, she *will* choose punishment over prevention. Because she is a very vindicative girl who takes her anger out on others.
* Following on from that, if you agree with what Hermione did to Marietta, then you are also providing an enabling environment for what Umbridge did to Harry. They both scar their victims as punishment, and both Hermione and Umbridge genuinely believe they are justified in doing so. There is no black and white here; permanently scarring a child is abuse. Umbridge abused Harry. Hermione abused Marietta. There was ample opportunity for Hermione to realize that if she doesn't buck her ideas up, she *will become Umbridge,* but it never happens. Umbridge is in the wrong for permanently scarring a child because she's the villain, Hermione is in the right for permanently scarring a child because she's a hero, any attempt to show readers that sometimes our heroes *can* do awful things and that we shouldn't always agree with what they do is thrown out the window.
* I don't count the Cursed Child as canon, but it does confuse me when people say Harry would never have lost his temper at Albus in the way he did and expressed a wish that Albus was not his son. I think that's a really in character thing for Harry to say. Harry is *mean* sometimes. He can be really, really cruel. He has a long history of thinking, saying, or doing cruel things; he even sets Hedwig on his *best friends* to the point they *start bleeding* because he's mad at them. He was thinking *really horrible things* about Ron when Ron got the Prefect position and Harry didn't. Harry's mind can be a very dark place sometimes, but the other characters still like him because 99% of the time, Harry is kind enough to never voice the things he's thinking. The argument with Albus was the 1% time Harry snapped and voiced exactly what he was thinking. It confuses me so much when people complain about this scene, because I just think...that is perfectly in character. It was a horrific, horrible thing for Harry to say, but that's because he does sometimes do and think horrific, horrible things. He's done it for the entire series.

&#x200B;

* I don't really like Molly and whilst I don't doubt she adores her family, she also created an environment that none of them minus Harry particularly enjoy being in. She belittles her husband's favourite hobby even when he's literally in a hospital bed, she belittles Fred and George to the point they hide their (very impressive) ambitions and achievements from her, and both she and Arthur consistently failed to keep Percy from being bullied within his own home, only for Arthur to turn around and blame *Percy* when he finally gets fed up of it (I *like* Arthur, but he definitely let Percy down and I don't see that talked about enough). I don't think either of them are bad parents by any means, but they made a lot of mistakes. Harry just didn't see it because anything is better than the Dursleys. The Weasleys are an incredibly realistic family, but I wish we talked more about their flaws.
* Adding onto *that,* Fred and George had a vicious and cruel streak that is far too often overlooked as being funny rather than acknowledged for what it is: a very serious problem. As small children they cast a horrible spell on Ron that traumatized him into a phobia of spiders even years later. I don't in any way blame F&G for doing something bad as kids, but the fact that they continue to do such things even as teens/young adults suggests to me they didn't learn anything from that lesson. They use other students as human experiments (specifically choosing younger students who are far more easily influenced and less likely to ask any awkward questions), they *do* bully Percy to the point that I'm *glad* he left the Weasleys house to escape it, they sell love potions in their shop, and of course, they almost murdered Montague JUST FOR TAKING HOUSE POINTS AWAY FROM THEM. Some of what they did bordered on, if not heads straight into, psychopathy and sadism, and neither of them gave a hoot."
ptsd,fms4nsm,t3_fwvfpa,1586346454.0,"I do think this is a collective trauma for the whole world, but that not everybody will get PTSD from it obviously and not everyone will even be traumatized. Trauma, traumatized, and PTSD are 3 different things. Someone can go through trauma without being traumatized or developing PTSD.

In this case, countries have shut down, people are forced to stay inside (sometimes either by themselves or with abusive family), there was a worrying period where it was difficult for some to find food in supermarkets, everyone you get close to could have a contagious virus, and everything you touch could have a contagious virus. That's trauma, but it won't be *traumatic* for everyone.

For me I think the collective trauma means that this is an event that will likely affect the majority of people for the rest of our lives, even in tiny little ways. Imagine, in forty years time, a cough starts making its way around a community. The next generation will just see it as what it is, a normal cough, but there will be a large percentage of our generation who immediately, and very understandably, fear another pandemic. There are going to be children, especially, who spend a year seeing everyone in their household constantly cleaning and disenfecting: that's going to stick in some of those kid's minds and follow them into adulthood.

Saying this is collective trauma in no way is trying to invalidate people with PTSD. At the end of the day, we're in a worldwide pandemic where we're bombarded with death rates every time we turn on the news. That's *traumatic.* It doesn't mean we will all be *trauma****tized.*** Just that we are all currently going through a very dangerous situation that will certainly shape some of our mindsets and paranoia for the rest of our lives."

Hermione was a child who had a very vicious streak and many times intentionally set out to hurt people, including people she claimed to love. In the first few books it can be explained as her being a little girl who's still learning, but even as a teenager and young adult, she is never called out on her behaviour either by other characters or JKR herself, and as such gets away with harming others again and again. I literally don't know how else to explain to people that this is what an abusive personality looks like.

Have you tried Heroes of Olympus, The Kane Chronicles, Trials of Apollo and the Magnus Chase series by Riordan? I haven't read TKC but HoO has romance, but not to the point it's overwhelming. Magnus Chase has romance, but it's like Percy was, where romance isn't the Huge Thing (it's also a LGBTQ+ romance if that sells the lovey-dovey side to you a bit more.)

&#x200B;

And I haven't read them, but I've also heard very good things about Wings of Fire, which is about dragons, if that floats your boat."

ptsd,fmaqqx2,t1_fmai8m4,1585904069.0,"Maybe to stop comparing your trauma to others, you could remember that you don't know anyone's whole trauma story unless they choose to spell the entire thing out for you. For example, this woman; for all we know, her husband could have been abusive, and him leaving was another form of abuse (eg 'you're a bad wife so I'm not putting up with you anymore' when she hasn't done anything wrong). They could have started dating under inappropriate or illegal circumstances and her brain is telling her that was wrong but her logical mind hasn't caught up yet. Or maybe he left her because he did something really, really wrong and she's latching onto 'he left me' in order to avoid confronting the wrong thing he did.

Sometimes even people with PTSD don't fully realize what caused it. I've seen people with diagnosed PTSD doubt their own diagnosis and insist they didn't go through bad trauma, but when asked about their history, list off things that clearly are traumatizing. 

&#x200B;

I can understand how you feel, though. I've sometimes felt the same way. I think it's always good to take a step back and (as gently as I can, I'm not attacking you here) realize you aren't the only person in the world. Everyone you meet has their own story and own experiences and own problems. It's very easy to get so consumed in your own trauma that everyone else's trauma doesn't fully resonate with you, but once you realize just how many people you share this world with, it made me more humble at least."
ptsd,fm71ubg,t3_ftggvv,1585810255.0,"No diagnosis but I'm pretty sure I have PTSD from my friends suicide attempt and the subsequent emotional abuse I suffered when attempting to talk about it with other people. This friend is still my best friend and there have been a couple of times we've clashed over it.

I think just listening to each other is the best bet. In my case, I NEEDED my feelings to be constantly validated, but my friend needed space to not talk about what happened so often. As a solution, I started validating myself and she didn't hold our arguments against me even when I was being irrational.

Your friend feels like she's walking on eggshells, and you feel like that makes you detective (it doesn't). Maybe you could both sit down and discuss how to make an environment that caters to both of you. It's okay for your friend to express anger, annoyance and frustration; it's okay for you to say you can't listen to that right now and step away. Saying you understand why she feels this way and then maybe offering suggestions of who else she can vent to, before removing yourself from the conversation for your own safety, may be s good way to validate both of you at once."
ptsd,fm7106v,t3_fte50n,1585809450.0,"I don't know if cheating can cause PTSD or not. Some professionals say it can and others say it can't. PTSD is still something they're all learning about. Some will stick very closely to the criteria that says your trauma must have been life threatening. Others think that criteria is outdated and doesn't encompass all traumas. In my opinion both viewpoints, in a time when we still do not know that much about PTSD, are valid. We simply do not know which is right and which is wrong.

What I DO know is that you've clearly been traumatized. Maybe even severely traumatized. Many people assume a PTSD diagnosis is the only way to validate and acknowledge their trauma without realizing there are other trauma illnesses that are just as serious and valid as PTSD. Adjustment disorder and acute stress disorder are two other trauma illnesses; they are just as worthy of attention as PTSD.

So the honest answer is that I do not know if you have PTSD. Every one with PTSD will give you a different answer. Your best bet is to find a good, qualified psychotherapist who will be able to give you that answer. Don't be afraid to ask for a second or even third opinion if you're still unsure with their diagnosis, or lack of one.

I know it's difficult to get out of the mindset that you NEED to have PTSD in order to be traumatized. You don't. Being traumatized in and of itself is serious enough for others to offer you all the support in the world. If you do have PTSD then I hope you get that diagnosis. If you don't, I hope you continue to seek trauma support any way. The trauma toolbox reddit is a good one for people who don't have to have any diagnosis.

I'd also gently suggest distancing yourself from your boyfriend. I don't doubt he's a good person who feels remorse for his actions. But right now being around him is making you sick. You need and deserve to get better, and it will be difficult to do that with the constant triggers.

I've also heard of something called PISD, post infidelity stress disorder. Now, I don't think this is an actual diagnosis. But I'm pretty sure victims of cheating have been known to use this term to acknowledge their trauma symptoms whilst differentiating it from your run of the mill PTSD. Perhaps searching up that will find you a place with more support and people more qualified to determine your initial question?

Good luck and stay safe."
ptsd,fm02zh7,t3_fs1l3i,1585642667.0,"I was abused by depressed people, and for years I had a severe mistrust of anyone with mental illness or depression. I thought they would all abuse me again. I'd be terrified whenever somebody said they'd been diagnosed with depression and want to get as far away from them as possible. My main abuser has also won or been nominated for various mental health awards, despite emotionally abusing me for two and a half years to the point I was suicidal and utterly traumatized.

But do you know what happened? Some of the people I now trust most with my trauma are depressed people. It's them who validated me and told me what happened to me was abuse and that it wasn't my fault.

People are individuals and you will find good and bad in every group. You are completely right in that people DO assume all doctors are a hivemind of goodness, and for that reason I am so sorry the clapping for the health service triggered you. I can completely see why. 

What those doctors did to you was horrific and they deserve to be sacked for it. Any therapist who refuses to accept that people in their career can also be abusers is not a good therapist.

This man did not pop out of the womb with the mindset he has that he should plough through any illness or injury he sustains rather than looking after himself at home.

Forgotten Hill is also good. I can't remember what the first few online games were like since I played them a few years ago, but I can tell you I had a great time playing The Museum (which took me days to finish-it's a massive game)

Submachine is another massive online game, and is actually a series of 10? 12? I can't remember but anyway there's a lot of separate games. *Personally* these aren't my favourite because they are very number, code, and science heavy. However if you like those kinds of puzzles I think you'll easily be able to spend at least a few days going through these games.

The Mystery Of Time And Space (MOTAS) is old but still a good and very large escape game. I can't really give you a synopsis here since it's literally, you start in one weird room, escape, and find yourself in another one, escape, go to the next one, etc. Like I said though it's large, with 20 levels.

Daymare Town is a series of 4 relatively short games that focus on surrealism. It's not *horror* as such but it's definitely creepy. It's also all drawn in a really nice handdrawn squiggly lineart, which is so cool to look at and explore.

Afro Ninja's series is an old classic. They aren't long at all but they'll get your brain working for a bit. They all do a bit of a twist on 'escape *rooms'* by making you escape instead from a very small place, like a telephone box or a car.

And my favourite online escape game:

Baba Yaga. It's a fantasy escape game where you have been kidnapped by a witch and have to escape her house. Cats! Elves! Magic! Cauldrons! Oh my god I love this game so much.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

If you're willing to pay for your escape game and are also interested in mysteries and psychological horror, 999: Zero Escape is one of my favourite games. I played it on the DS but you can play it on Steam too (probably recommended since it improves some of the vital mechanics). Essentially you play as this guy who has been kidnapped along with 8 other people and trapped on a ship. Your kidnapper tells you that you have 9 hours to escape the ship. To escape, you need to go through 9 doors. Through each door is an escape room (escape the bathroom, escape the bedroom, etc) Once you escape one room, you come out the other side and continue the story of trying to work out why you're here and who kidnapped you, before going through another door and escaping again. God I love this game. (DO NOT LOOK IT UP ONLINE. YOU WILL GET SPOILED VERY, VERY EASILY.)"

I do fear being a bad person; one of my counselors even said that to me flat-out once.

Like you said I am lightskinned/whitepassing and so like every white/whitepassing person I do have subconscious racism and bias. I think it's important for everyone to acknowledge that and actively work to unlearn it. Like you said, we live in such a racist society that it's near impossible to go through life without picking some of it up. The racism-related OCD is very different to that. It isn't the same as the subconscious racism everyone has: it's almost like I can *feel* it coming from a different part of my brain. It's like my brain is screaming at me non-stop that I'm an awful racist person and my brain is just getting barraged with horrific thoughts and images. My dad is dark-skinned (many would see him as black, although he prefers biracial as far as I known), and I have been too anxious to be near him sometimes due to my OCD screaming at me in my head.

ptsd,firlwax,t3_f9e2hg,1582666868.0,"Hi. I'm traumatized from my best friend telling me about her suicide attempt when I was 14. When I found a group of adults to vent to about how I felt online, they publically shamed me for my emotions and refused to remove my post for two and a half years in order to show people how they shouldn't feel when someone they know attempts suicide. I'm 20 now so for me it's been 6 years of finally coming to accept I've been traumatized and also that what those adults did to me was abuse.

So here's my first advice: find people you TRUST. Some people simply do not understand that a loved ones suicide attempt can cause just as much grief and trauma as a suicide. It sucks.

Validate ALL your feelings. Feelings are there to help you process things. Let them do their job. Anger, sadness, even numbness: all of those feelings are asking for your assistance in letting them exist. No feelings are bad feelings. It's only if you take them out on other people that they can become toxic.

You might hear people say ""This isn't about you"". That's not right. You witnessed a traumatic event. It is just as much about you as It is your boyfriend. Stand up for yourself and never let anybody try and guilt you into keeping quiet about how you feel.

I'm afraid I can't find you any links since that's too triggering for me. I would say that finding info on depression or whatever it is that made your bf's mental state so sick is vital-but don't get obsessed with it. The advice you find in there will not apply to every mentally ill person, because mentally ill people are not a hivemind. Take the mental health advice that applies to your boyfriend and leave the rest.

You didn't say how long ago thus suicide attempt was. PTSD can only be diagnosed if you've had these symptoms for at least a month. The good news is that if you seek help for yourself now and surround yourself with people who will comfort you, your chances of developing it decrease.

Best of luck to you and your boyfriend."
