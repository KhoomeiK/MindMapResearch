BodyDysmorphia,fouacnz,t1_foto4y0,1588080042.0,"I know what you mean, I want that validation but even if someone tells me I'm good looking I don't really believe them.

As for my co worker there does seem to be a lot of girls who are attracted to that type of guy especially when they have the looks as well. It's a shame they either can't see through him or they just don't care because he's good looking."
BodyDysmorphia,forcrl6,t1_foos3yd,1588010028.0,Amazing what you can get away with if you're good looking.
BodyDysmorphia,foq2xou,t1_fopqkhh,1587981059.0,"Nothing wrong with him knowing he's good looking, it's more his general demeanour and attitude. The way he goes around giving everyone compliments and trying to charm everyone comes across as smarmy and insincere to me. Nothing wrong with confidence either but his borders on arrogance, I've heard him actually boasting about how handsome he is."
BodyDysmorphia,fnhtf26,t1_fnem84l,1586968531.0,"Oh bless you. You know, maybe your parents are right and it's just a phase like a lot of young people go through but do they fully understand that you've had feelings of depression? Depression isn't something to be taken lightly, even if it's only mild feelings of depression. You could also talk to a teacher maybe.

Like I said depression isn't something to feel ashamed about, lots of people have it. The worst thing you can do is bottle it up. If things get worse you must tell someone but I hope things get better anyway. ☺️"
BodyDysmorphia,fnbs4lg,t1_fmww5c0,1586821230.0,All that says to me is that they're jealous. Some women can get threatened by other women. But as a guy I've noticed this behaviour with men too. I've seen guys put other men down purely because they see them as competition.
BodyDysmorphia,fn68m47,t1_fmyk6tf,1586691641.0,"It's actually nonsense isn't it? Instead of just looking an attractive face and seeing it for what it is they have to analyse every detail and pick apart every little flaw like it's some kind of scientific study. Thing is when it comes to attractiveness the whole is greater then the sum of its parts. Penelope Cruz has a large nose, Julia Roberts has a very wide mouth but does this mean they're not beautiful?"
BodyDysmorphia,fn33t1d,t3_fylmrv,1586612117.0,It took me too long to learn about toxic people and cut them out. Toxic friends are the worst because they pretend to be your friend but put you down and make you feel bad. I learned that you don't need lots of friends only genuine ones.
BodyDysmorphia,fn0eunf,t1_fmy8gdr,1586540640.0,No thank you. I think it's important people know the truth about these subs and that even applies to people who don't have BDD.
BodyDysmorphia,fmzbd9p,t1_fmy7ooq,1586513937.0,"Bullies or trolls will say anything to get a reaction. It doesn't even have to be true. They can make you paranoid about things that may not even be that bad. When I was at school other guys would bully me for being small, in fact they made my life hell for a while. But as I got older I realised being small wasn't such a big deal, in fact I realised a lot of people found small guys endearing and attractive. Don't let what some immature trolls said define you. 

Please don't compare yourself to those ""perfect"" celebrities. People who look like that are about 2% of the population. Nobody looks like them.

You do sound very mature for your age but anyone who is 12 still has a lot of developing to do both mentally and physically. Things will change, you will change. Trust me. 

I do think it would be a good idea to speak to someone you trust (maybe your parents). Ther's no shame in it."
BodyDysmorphia,fmxysk4,t1_fmwyfc6,1586474562.0,"Agree, it works both ways. It's a myth that girls don't care about looks as much as men as any below average guy will tell you. Do people really think good looking guys don't get more attention and treated better by girls? 
As a guy I also think it's a bit harsh to judge all guys as having high standards. Some do but not all. I certainly don't see looks as everything."
BodyDysmorphia,fmxxnq3,t1_fmwh5lw,1586473913.0,It seemed to me like a most of the people asking to be rated were male as well. I might be wrong about that but it seems a bit strange.
BodyDysmorphia,fmxs191,t1_fmwh5kt,1586470751.0,"Please know that true rate me sub is probably the worst of the lot. They have rules that actually encourage people to downvote/underrate peoples looks. You can be banned for telling people they are beautiful. How twisted is that?

I've seen stunning girls only get rated a 5 there so no it's not realistic in the slightest. They are incels and assholes, you said it yourself so don't let them or their bs rating bring you down."
BodyDysmorphia,fmp6wcr,t1_fmo2zic,1586275553.0,"Who knows, could be trolling in a subtle way or maybe they weren't thinking straight."
BodyDysmorphia,fmelsz0,t1_fmdspxt,1586007806.0,"I know, I think those type of subs are wrong on so many levels and then you've also got rules that pressure people to rate others low or underrate. I think I'm staying away from those subs now."

beauty,fm43uji,t1_fm413p3,1585745815.0,Looks interesting. How bad does it look while healing? Would people notice (bearing in mind I'd only get it done in the area above one eye)?
beauty,fm3z480,t1_fm0hl6p,1585741984.0,I use the ORS castor oil and almond oil mix. Is it OK to use just water to wash it out of your brows the next morning?
BodyDysmorphia,fm280vl,t1_fm1jdfr,1585692289.0,I had a quick look and I feel personally it's a bit too far the other way though. I know they've got strict rules about inflating but they give really good looking people 5 or 5.5. I just thought to myself in real life those people would not be seen as average or a 5.
truerateme,fm0djfu,t1_flzxe67,1585654322.0,This is true but sadly I think insecure or unhappy people are exactly the type of people who post on this type of sub.
BodyDysmorphia,fm0d0ht,t1_flz8fih,1585653796.0,People are even more harsh on there aren't they? I'm not sure I want to lol!
BodyDysmorphia,flyal2k,t3_fqqf7q,1585598574.0,"I went on a rate me sub and got generally decent comments - mostly ratings of 6 or so (which is above average on their scale) and people said I was ""quite handsome"" or ""quite cute"". ""Quite"" handsome and slightly above average wasn't enough for me. I looked at other guys posts who were getting 7 or 8 scores and couldn't understand why they were being seen as hot or very handsome and I wasn't. Some of them only looked average to me."
BodyDysmorphia,flecp1j,t1_fle4m3v,1585081842.0,"I've know exactly what you mean. Ive tried everything - herbal tablets, sleep pillow spray, sleep tincture, even listening to a hypnosis cd! If you suffer from insomnia you’ll try anything to get to get a better night's sleep unfortunately if you have chronic insomnia the only thing that really works is proper sleeping tablets. I would advise against taking them though. Alcohol, as you said, is also not a good idea because, well, it's alcohol and even if it gets you to sleep you're not getting real sleep.

I've thought about therapy, it's definitely an option. One thing that has helped me a bit with insomnia and also anxiety is meditation. I would recommend an app called ""smiling mind"", it's got meditations and exercises for everything from getting more energy to falling asleep. X"
BodyDysmorphia,fl7x6my,t3_fn37zr,1584911287.0,"This is actually a wise thing to say and it's not just about attractive people being more successful romantically because it's been proven in studies that good looking people get treated better and are more successful in life generally. People subconsciously assume good looking people are more trustworthy and intelligent. People will gravitate towards them, give them more attention and let them get away with more. It's also been proven that attractive people do better in job interviews and get favouritism in the workplace."
Anxiety,fkp6zep,t3_fjobz7,1584403206.0,"I'm scared to have an opinion about anything on Reddit because it's full of snarks, trolls and people who want to prove they're smarter then you. Any time I have a strong opinion on here I just dread the stupid replies I'm going to get."
BodyDysmorphia,fklitug,t1_fkld3yd,1584307237.0,"No problem, I hope so too because BDD isn't a short term thing or something that just goes away so you have to find a way to cure yourself if possible or at least find a way to live with it."
BodyDysmorphia,fkliapm,t3_fj58gq,1584306881.0,No doubt your hair makes a big difference to how you look and you don't need to suffer from BDD to be traumatised by a bad haircut. Like anything else some hairdresser's are better then others. I find one I trust and stick with it in the future. The thing with a haircut though is it isn't permanent. I would definitely bring a picture of the haircut you want next time.
BodyDysmorphia,fkl6g7c,t3_fj4yzi,1584299517.0,"Because the angle of the picture, lighting and camera lens size all change the way you look a lot.

In short don't take a photo as a true reflection of how you look."

BodyDysmorphia,fjf2xbh,t1_fjejb24,1583283163.0,Thankyou! I was just talking to someone else about what evil places rate subs can be. The vain and narcissistic get their egos massaged while the vulnerable get destroyed or ignored. I am definitely not doing it again!
