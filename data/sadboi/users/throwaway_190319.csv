depression,f8aas8c,t3_dzrccf,1574392203.0,I feel the same way. I have a long distance boyfriend who is kind and supportive but I feel ashamed to just not be able to share his joy and enthusiasm for life. I want someone to hug me while I can't stop crying but that's such a turn off for anyone. I hate myself and I hate living. I love my boyfriend and I constantly feel that he is stuck with me and can do better. Somedays I don't even make eye contact with a single person because I feel my need for love and human contact would just intensify so much.

It's getting to a point where it's starting to affect my own productivity at work and relationships with my friends since I can't stop thinking about what's going on with her.

About you feeling awful about her unhappiness, can you feel happy without her? Ultimately if she doesn't seek help and if you can't decouple your well-being that may be the thing you have to do, but before that do the things that are in your control to see if some vitality can be restored. Can I suggest to look into codependency issue for yourself? I found codependent no more an excellent read. Even though it is an old text and talks a lot about a particular kind of issue that develops in spouses of partners with addiction issues, more recent texts in psychology suggests that it also happens in people who are partners with certain personality type. Beware that reading the book can evoke strong emotions if you identify with it but if it is the case, recognizing it is the first step. I am a spiritual person and sometimes wonder that we are attracted to certain people or invite them in our life to work through our own issues and to cause self-growth. She will have her own growth journey. It is immensely frustrating if two people are not on the same path of self-growth but no two people will forever be on the same path. So I believe it is wise to be able to walk alongside but on your own path. I am not suggesting to give up on her, or your desire for her to see herself with as much love as you do, I am suggesting to deeply believe that it will happen, just not on your clock or by your doing."
depression,f7kdkzq,t3_dwfcja,1573804700.0,"Your wife sounds awfully similar to me, except I am not athletic or very fit. Nothing can make me feel good about myself. My boyfriend says he loves me no matter what then it feels like pity. I have some good days though. I am more focused on being able to help or add value to other people's life and it creates a problem that I depend on others for happiness but it at least lets me have some good days. 

I was married to someone else and separated 2 years ago. Have been in therapy since and on antidepressants. Therapy is a long process and changes a person. When a person starts a journey to unlayer years of issues, it is not pleasant to be around that person. The first person who comes in the line of fire on years of suppressed issues, angst, complexes is usually the spouse. So, stay strong and wise.

What I want from my boyfriend is to accept that even if it is part depression and part personality, it is not going to magically disappear. I would say that stay strong and focus on your wellness for yourself and for her. You can't support her if you are not well. Get your own therapist. Don't ask them what you should do but ask how do I deal with negativity and stress caused by her outlook. She will change at her pace when she is ready. Accept that you can't magically fix her. Her happiness is not your responsibility I agree, but she is your love and your family, so it is natural for you to want to see her happy and to couple your happiness with hers. If your love is strong, stick with it but find ways to decouple your happiness from fixing her."
