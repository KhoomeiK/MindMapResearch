Usually they mistake mental illnesses like depression and anxiety with normal human emotions, like sadness that subsided and fear before an event.
So when you are actually suffering people assume it’s just you being annoying of selfish, people are fine with someone being mentally ill as long as they don’t act like it.

A good example of a head someone has done which uses this but still keeps the stylised look of the head is @normanpatchesnfurs on Instagram (opossum icky)

For foam base carving the only tip I have is looking at how others do it, I’d probably advise following a more realistic base carving tutorial/idea since it’s shaped pretty realistically, if you’re looking for high quality (fur) fabric for the cheapest price you’ll find I’d say go to bigZfabrics.com, they post and show off creations that have been made by fellow furries using their fabrics so you’ll be able to see the quality definitely in that.

FurryArtSchool,fdhi3u4,t3_elci9y,1578423118.0,"The style which they are drawn in is completely fine there are just 3 tips I have

1. Be confident in your lines, I notice that on some of the drawings your lines are most scratchy and close together, being confident with your lines to avoid this to get a smother, Niger outcome I know it doesn’t make much sense but drawing with a ‘loose wrist’ is a big help
2. The type of pencil, I’m not sure what kind of pencil you used but the work seems very sharp and dark, it could all be to do with how hard you’re pressing on the paper in the sketching stages, how sharp your pencil is (having it just a little blunt seems to give a nicer effect) or what grade it is (HB,B4,H5 etc...)  but keeping the pencil lighter upon the page while in the beginning sketching stages (still deciding what looks good) Will help with the end look of a pencil piece, I personally do a light sketch first then go over the lines that I think look good by pressing harder.
3. Smudge shading, although can be a useful tool especially when trying to get more blended shading can be hard to control; especially when just using your finger. I don’t think your art style suits smudge shading at this current time, there a loads of shading techniques that would look good for your style such as: cross hatching, bordering where you want the shadow then filling the space with lines, just doing the diagonal line thing without the boarder (there are probably more I just can’t think of them off the top of my head)

If you want to work towards having a style where pencil blend shading would look good then I’d advise looking for artists who have a style you like and studying them (not tracing or copying, studying)

Your art is cute and as long as you keep practicing and making art a thing you love you will get better with time :)
I hope this helps💕"

FurryArtSchool,fddwgq6,t3_ekvg6w,1578325663.0,"The expression and general art style of your character is a cute one and is doing fine :)

To improve it, you’d need to definitely look at anatomy.
For example; the neck of this character is verrrry long, I’m not sure what species she is supposed to be (if she’s meant to be a giraffe or not)  but the floof on the neck suggests not giraffe meaning you can contain the same amount of floof but you just have to compress it (the floof on the neck can face up towards the face at the start) 
One leg looks a lot skinnier than the others, and although perspectives can make it like that from time to time it shouldn’t be that extreme especially in a pose like that

Another note is to think about how clothing works, even the tightest stretchy-est shirt will wrinkle and cling in some places 
Using lines to show the direction of how the shirt would fit over the body will help a lot with drawing clothing :)
It’s all hard to explain the specifics but I hope this helps💕"

FurryArtSchool,fd6da3p,t3_ek4y14,1578189211.0,"If you’re a beginner artist this is a wonderful start, here’s a few tips to take your headshots for good to amazing;
1. Use your canvas, an amazing thing (especially with digital art) is that you can change your canvas size to however big or small you want to, you don’t have to fill the whole space, especially 
With a headshot, but making your character the main focus of the canvas will make it that much more better
2. Study how other furry artist draw, for example I know a lot of different artist have different styles . There are more scary styles, edgy styles, cute styles, realistic, toony. Find an artist you like and take into consideration how they draw things
(E.g how does the way the cheek fur move make this character look? How does the thickness or cleanness of the lines change the mood? How can I give this character a facial expression to show the audience to show this character’s personality)
3. Trying to experiment with shading and highlights will teach you a LOT for future reference, although flat coloured headshots can still look good I think most people who consider buying want something with more life and colour.
For colouring advice my LIFE SAVER is making your background layer a neutral colour (like brown) or the colour you want your background to be and test which colours look good with such a background (it honestly makes so much of a difference)
4. Adding even a simple background will just simply improve the quality, like 100%. I know a lot of beginner or young artists make the mistake of just leaving it completely white because backgrounds can be hard to decide on, but just test different things and look at how other artists colour their backgrounds.
Adorable headshot! Keep working and practicing to make yourself even better💕"

I got moved schools and only stayed in contact with a few people (2-3) who I knew really cared, since only one text me to see how I was in the hospital and that’s always the test i think before I make any friends; “would this person care if I was in the hospital”
My advise for these sort of people is to cut them off before they try to destroy you for their own little fun game. Don’t deal with bullshit people, being alone is better than that.

FurryArtSchool,fcuzawc,t3_eizz0z,1577991498.0,"Your body pose is pretty good but my advice would be to work on the facial expressions of the character.
For example I could imagine this character being happy yet embarrassed in the situation so making the eyes bigger, pupils smaller, adding some kind of blushing and having the pupils focus on who they’re talking to (the person viewing the art) rather than having the eyes unfocused and off. Eyebrows and facial expressions take an art piece from good to great! Hope this helps ya! :)"

If you need anything else I guess construction lines would be about it but honestly you’re doing great! Keep drawing and finding what you like :)"
FurryArtSchool,fct9lao,t3_eio8ud,1577936564.0,"Adorable drawing 

For tips I can give you a few;

1. Background detail and character detail should never be equal (unless you’re going for hyper realism), to focus bring focus onto the character make it the main thing (e.g have a simple background, blur the background a little, have every different colours from background to character)
2. Pick a place where the lighting should come from and stick to it, practicing shading is a vital step in getting better at art and one day you’ll just know where to put it all like second nature
3. I don’t know what drawing program you used, if you’re drawing with your finger on your phone I’d advise sticking to traditional pen and paper until you can afford a cheap tablet as a starter. Using your finger decreases the quality massively and I understand how difficult it is to build up funds for that sort of thing but honestly it’s so worth it, your line art and colouring massively

If you’re looking for a free art programme I with my full heart and soul advise firealpaca. I have used it for a while and the gradual yet clear improvement is so present. Using a free program and a cheap tablet is nothing wrong, although the most expensive things are easier to use but practice makes better :)

I hope this helps💕"
FurryArtSchool,fct8xnu,t3_eirsb8,1577936039.0,"My tip for making more garden-like things look more natural is these
1.  Be confident in your lines, know what you want and draw it. Having a loose wrist and pressing onto the paper lightly is a lot better so making mistakes won’t be the end of it all 
2. Shapes are everything, the best trick I always say is that nothing natural (like leaves and stuff) have sharp geometric edges. They can have sharp points but not edges 
3. Using construction lines is nothing to be ashamed of, I assure you all popular artists always use construction lines and that’s how they get their anatomy and shapes looking good

But the most important tip is to NEVER give up. Practice and enjoy it, art shouldn’t be a chore and when you enjoy it, it should be a lot easier 

I hope this helps  you’re doing great 💕"
