He called 911 right after and turned himself in. I had known him since seventh grade, I remember him having an edgy sense of humor, but that‚Äôs normal for a middle schooler. I suspect his dad was abusing him due to hearing about him apparently having a rough home life. Although, he was 18 when he did it and if that was the case, why didn‚Äôt he just move out or wait a couple months to go off to college like his older brother?
