BipolarReddit,fr5e6xv,t1_fr51zol,1589907096.0,"It all depends. There’s factors such as how you’re responding to it, outside factors, etc. I would really recommend contacting your psychiatrist though. I’ve been good but with COVID I’ve been leaning towards the depressive side of things. I was having ideations so I immediately called my psycho and booked an appointment. I promise you’re worth seeking help."
BipolarReddit,fr4wktg,t3_gmojyo,1589898243.0,"Hey, I know how much this part of Bipolar sucks. All of what you’re feeling is temporary. I know that depressive place you’re in and it sucks. It’s exhausting to get up to go to the bathroom or get a glass of water. This depressive episode will pass and you will feel better. Remember that if you do one thing, even if it’s getting up to brush your teeth, that’s an accomplishment. I promise this will pass. Feel better <3"

BipolarReddit,fr332cn,t3_gm3rzk,1589848947.0,"I’ve been smoking for the past 10 years. I was diagnosed with Bipolar II about a year and a half ago, and within the last year I got my medical card (OH). Here are my thoughts on medical marijuana and Bipolar Disorder:

- Everyone’s brain chemistry is different. Some respond better to some meds than others, same goes with marijuana. For some people it just doesn’t work.
- You have to find the right strains. If you give me nearly any indica I’m probably going to get super paranoid and panic. If you give me a hybrid it’s a great middle, and a sativa makes me happy and care-free. Depending on my mood I may resort to one over the other. For example, if I’m in a depressive episode and need some energy or pep I’ll go for a sativa.
- Though my tolerance is ridiculous, eating edibles really messed me up. I’m on the petite side but edibles just make me flat. I stick to flower. 
- I don’t believe that medical marijuana should be used alone in treating Bipolar Disorder. I also have PTSD and that’s how I was able to get my card. I’m still in 200mg of Lamictal, which I love, and have 100mg of Gabapentin for any flash backs or panic attacks. Medical marijuana helps to curve a lot of the anxiety that I have. 

Hopefully this was helpful! This is just my opinion. I encourage working closely with your psychiatrist. Mine is in favor of medical marijuana under the right circumstances. I also think it’s important to understand your typical waves of depressive and manic, as well as to listen to the recommendations of the dispensary. I smoke every single day but you have to know what works for you."
SNHU,fr31xz4,t3_gmcbwt,1589848305.0,Congrats!
abusiverelationships,fr31ut8,t3_gm617d,1589848255.0,How liberating! I absolutely love this.
books,fqykb0b,t3_glberg,1589749971.0,I’ve always been a huge book worm. I was in an abusive relationship a few years ago and I stopped doing everything that I loved because I didn’t want to associate with that time. I’m still struggling getting back into reading but I’m trying. Thank you so much for posting this. I thought I was alone.
TurnipStonkMarket,fqv824s,t3_gl30qp,1589671762.0,I dm’d you :)
pastlives,fqm2ksf,t3_gjh7zm,1589470412.0,"This is so crazy! What an experience you had with your past life. You must be very in tune with your intuition (sounds like Jarl/Edd may not be). 

I can also lucid dream and I’ve dreamt of spider people. Do you have any insight on that? I’ve had that sort of dream virtually my entire life, but less as I’ve gotten older."
BipolarReddit,fqkxs9h,t3_gjbww1,1589439503.0,My Lamictal was increased from 150mg to 200mg a week ago. I’ve been taking Lamictal for a little over a year now and it’s my favorite medication that I’ve been on so far. I’ve noticed it takes away a little of my creativity but it makes it so much easier to be productive and happy. I had the will power to lose 50 pounds and go back to school. This medication has changed my life. It does take a little while to kick in and increase in dosage are always a little hard at first. My advice is to keep with it because the longer you’re on it the more benefits you’ll see. Medication works different for everyone but I’m so happy I found Lamictal.

BipolarReddit,fq8iohl,t3_ghcqre,1589167094.0,"I am so all over the place. One second I’m crying and super depressed, the next I’m horny and manic. It’s exhausting. I just try to have a plan for when I’m feeling certain things on my period like always having chocolate on hand and watching my favorite movies"
AnimalCrossing,fpyios4,t3_gg2k11,1589004574.0,I’m sobbing
BipolarReddit,fpsa7dw,t1_fprqwd8,1588870057.0,I just got off a two hour FaceTime call with a super good friend of mine because we’ve barely talked in the last week. I was too scared to reach out to her because she’s been having such a hard pregnancy and I didn’t want to bother her. I don’t know your friends but I don’t think they hate you. I’ve learned it’s hard for others who don’t experience this to understand what’s going on in our brains and how it works. Stay patient with yourself though because you’re deserving of all friendship.
BipolarReddit,fps9m90,t1_fps9btz,1588869779.0,Truly I have not felt more understood anywhere else. This subreddit has been so beneficial because so much of what I’m going through is “normal.”
BipolarReddit,fprgjvz,t1_fpqggzc,1588853552.0,"Actually most of the time I’m pretty positive and supportive. I tend to put others above myself and then suffer silently. 

I feel like a nuisance to my friends and family because I feel like my problems are so minuscule to what they’re going through. My feelings and situations don’t matter and therefore I don’t want to inconvenience or minimize what they’re going through as well. In fact, I did reach out to a friend last night who told me that my feelings are valid and she’s always there for me to talk, despite being in her first trimester and having an awful time. 

I can’t speak for anyone else because we all handle things differently but just because you’re depressed doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t reach out. Perhaps the way you approach venting to friends and family needs to be adjusted, and perhaps a therapist is a good start on who you should vent to. But everyone’s feelings matter whether they’re in the dumps or having a high from a manic episode."
BipolarReddit,fprfity,t1_fpqf43o,1588852743.0,The person you’re close with is lucky to have you. Thanks for being an advocate :)
BipolarReddit,fprfevu,t1_fpqlxrm,1588852655.0,I was going every week for awhile and then after covid hit I was so scared I would potentially have to go into the office so I stopped. But I’m hoping my therapist will want to talk once-twice a week when I meet with her on Friday
BipolarReddit,fprfakh,t1_fpq8hov,1588852559.0,I journal every now and then but I’ve really fallen off the train of good things to do for mental health
BipolarReddit,fprf7vo,t1_fpqc2vl,1588852498.0,"This is exactly it. Especially when I open up to others that aren’t bipolar. It’s like they sympathize because I’m bipolar, n because of what I’m feeling. The stigma is awful."
BipolarReddit,fpq2400,t1_fpoidfl,1588813642.0,I’m taking a break from Stardew Valley for Animal Crossing but boy do I love that game
SNHU,fpo1tyg,t1_fpnx9u8,1588776848.0,Thank you so much! I really appreciate the heads up before I spent $100 on a calculator.
BipolarReddit,fpmsb5k,t3_ged9k9,1588740402.0,"I feel like mania is such a high that I experience everything so deeply. When I’m not manic everything feels numb because I’m used to those high feelings. I’ve ever told my therapist and psychiatrist how much I love being manic.  I’m more productive at work, I do a good job balancing work and school, I do yoga all the time. But when I’m feeling “normal” after I just want more and more to feel something. I totally get it."
BipolarReddit,fpmqr74,t3_ge55o4,1588739277.0,I would love for someone to take this away. It’s so painful.
My600lbLife,fpmpvmj,t3_ge6u8h,1588738652.0,I was going to watch something else on Hulu but after seeing this thread I turned on this episode. It’s my first time so send positive vibes please.
abusiverelationships,fpleekb,t3_gdwufk,1588711225.0,"You are so, so beautiful. I promise that the person you are is still inside of you even if it feels like they’re gone. You do deserve more out of life and it’s okay to grieve even when he’s gone. But it’s not okay for him to continuously make you feel like less when you’re so much more. Don’t let him dim your light."
BipolarReddit,fpl3zqc,t3_gdpbzw,1588705958.0,"Hey, regardless of what’s going on you’re worth finding companionship and love. It’s so easy to look from the outside in and pick apart all of the flaws about yourself. I’m bipolar 2 and have ptsd and am constantly worried that I’m going to lose a partner to my mood swings or daily triggers. Finding someone so patient is hard, and exhausting. But you’re worthy of finding that companionship, I promise you."
BipolarReddit,fpe0y50,t1_fpdwzi1,1588538174.0,I think I’m just scared that I’m going to shrink into this medication and I won’t have any parts of me left. It would be so fantastic to not have to deal with the heavy mood swings but I don’t want to not like who I am on it.
BipolarReddit,fpd91c5,t3_gcr6hz,1588522313.0,My psychiatrist wants to put me on Lithium and I’m terrified of this.
BipolarReddit,fpad34y,t3_gc96tr,1588445658.0,"I have the exact same diagnosis as you, I’m also Bipolar II and have PTSD. About a month ago I actually broke up with my boyfriend because I thought he was being stupid about he was handling this virus. I’ve mentioned that on other threads but I feel like it’s relevant with your mention of your boyfriend. Currently I’m pushing everyone away because I’m so irritated and annoyed. The heaviness of every day just looms over my head and I feel like there’s no break. I’m in Ohio and it’s been rainy and cold so I haven’t really been able to go outside, despite it helping so much on the nice days. 

I keep trying to challenge myself to change my perspective. Right now is the absolute worst but can you imagine the positivity that’s going to surround us when this is over? I’m finding more creativity in my day and putting my emotions towards creating (Animal Crossing lol). I left my boyfriend that I love so, so much but I’m still here. My cats are okay. I get to re-read Harry Potter.
 
Love to you and I hope things start turning around. There’s so much good ahead."
BipolarReddit,fp8el8e,t1_fp8ea23,1588390344.0,"I was diagnosed about a year ago and I still feel like in some ways it works against me rather than for me. The bad days are the worst but I try to look at the positive side and journal them. My moods may get really intense but because I feel everything so deeply it also makes me long and care deeper. I think that’s a positive thing, despite it being a “disorder.” I challenge myself to think of the positive things it does rather than the “negative.”"
BipolarReddit,fp8bw06,t3_gbxxzy,1588388469.0,"I’ve been in this place before and it sucks.  I know it’s hard to focus when you’re in that state but it’s temporary. Hormones make the episodes so, so much harder to deal with. But this isn’t your fault and it doesn’t change who you are. Hang in there. My favorite thing on my period is Taco Bell and moose tracks ice cream so lots and lots of self-care."
BipolarReddit,fp86rma,t3_gbo1kw,1588384956.0,"I was diagnosed with seasonal depression, general anxiety disorder, and clinical depression before I was diagnosed as bipolar II. I think a large reason why it took so long is because I would only reach out to help when I was feeling low. When I was manic I would stop taking my meds, stop going to therapy, start spending a ridiculous amount of $, and binge drinking. There’s some sprinkled in sexual promiscuity in there too. When I’m manic, at least before I started to recognize it, I felt on top of the world (and usually still do). I didn’t think there was anything wrong with what I was doing. Then I would crash into a depressive episode and want to die. 

I only was diagnosed with bipolar II when I ended up inpatient because of a suicide attempt over some undiagnosed PTSD I had from an abusive relationship. I also started being much more honest with my psychs and therapists whereas before I wouldn’t mention the serious debt I was in over manic shopping sprees. Looking back now it all makes so much sense but I didn’t recognize it at the time. I just happened to find a really good general care doctor who started asking questions that others hadn’t asked before. She wrote down a list of all the things I told her, as well as her thoughts on potential bipolar II diagnosis to bring to my psych. My psych even said how impressed she was and clearly I had a really great doctor. 

Hope it works out for you. Just hang in there, it can be tricky to diagnose but acknowledge how you feel and keep expressing that to your mental care experts."
BipolarReddit,fp85wmw,t3_gbesha,1588384338.0,"I’m type 2 and I’ve been on Lamictal for about a year now. I’m currently on 150 mg but I’m about to ask my psych to boost the medication. I also smoke medicinal as I also have PTSD from a nasty relationship. Here’s my review:

Strengths:
- It shaved off a large part of my depressive episodes. As a result, I felt more motivated and actually lost 60 pounds. 
- I’m much more productive at work and school. I work and go to school full time and still manage to do a great job at work and maintain consistent A’s. 
- Overall I don’t feel as irritable (my reason for wanting to raise my dosage) and don’t isolate as much. 

Negatives:
- My brain feels cloudy. I’m much clearer and more creative when I’m not on it.
- From reading this thread it looks like acne is a big side-effect. Mine has never been worse. Part of that may also be anxiety from the pandemic. 
- The mania has been ridiculous. My psych also wants to put me in lithium but I’m too scared. 

Just remember it may work great for you and it might not. It’s a medicine you start with a seriously low dosage and start to recognize fast so if you don’t like it you can try something else."
BipolarReddit,fp84zc5,t3_gbn7et,1588383647.0,"I am on the same page as you with a lot of these tendencies. I broke up with my boyfriend because I was irritated by how stupid he was being about how he was handling the virus. Granted, I do think the way he’s handling it is legitimately dumb but I keep catching myself on this “pedestal” and pushing away all of my friends as a result. I don’t know how to make it stop. Part of me wants to be around people and the other part of me gets so frustrated so I isolate. 

I’m also looking for ways to cope besides isolating. I haven’t been great about taking my medication on time which isn’t helping either. All love to you. Hope things start to get easier."
