I wear my Star of David for heritage reasons, not because I practice Judaism. The trials my ancestors went through just because they were Jewish mean a lot to me, and gives me strength that I’ll be able to overcome any adversities I face in my own lifetime. Of course, this isn’t what some rando hitting on me wants to hear in a bar at 1am so."

My BIL works at a hospital and got sent home because his coworker’s wife got a positive result and she called the hospital to complain. Yesterday was encouraging my SIL take her kids to a park to play and socialize. Totally taking the opportunity to blame Cuomo for tanking the economy and fear-mongering which is lol.

The other is, it was my turn to do grocery shopping yesterday and the guy behind me in the self-checkout line was literally breathing down my neck and stood shoulder to should with me. If I had been less pissed off by the machine not working I would have absolutely started a fight. Normal looking young people are at risk too!!

I’m also a big fan of hearing from different perspectives and some of the replies have been enlightening. I try to be considerate, and since I spend 8-4 in an office and don’t use public spaces (like a bus or train) I figured I was safe to wear something that smells nice. Most of the comments have reiterated that assumption but I know going forward that I should pass on the perfume if I know I’m running errands after work. :)"

AmItheAsshole,fi40pos,t1_fi3q9ie,1582131600.0,"I don’t even use half a spray. Because it’s fairly strong and expensive I’m trying to conserve it. I usually just press the top down enough to get a drop of liquid on my wrist. 
As for why I’m wearing it and motivation, I don’t have the limitations my mom did with scents and I’ve always wanted to wear them, my SIL knows this and is a huge “treat yo’ self” advocate and since my SO just had a good career change she convinced me that it’s justified. I also have asthma, though not as severe, triggered by smoking and exercise, as well as other health problems that all my coworkers know about. 

I’m mostly surprised about the double-standard, although it’s not very surprising from this manager. She’s gotten in trouble for just taking breaks whenever she wants to smoke and has done things like thrown out still lit cigarettes inside office trash cans inside the building. 

So maybe a little bit of both, I’m certainly wearing it because I want to smell nice, and it helps mitigate the smoke smells, but my boss said it was fine and my coworkers laughed and told me to keep wearing it just because it’ll make manager smokey leave me alone."

There’s a lot of possibilities for RT to team up with its community but I’m not sure if it’s something they would want to do considering how much of a branch off it is from their purpose as an entertainment company.
