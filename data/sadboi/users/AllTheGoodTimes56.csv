Then i had the opportunity to create another friendship, but in these days i'm risking to screw it up even this relationship, and i'm afraid i will see the white wahtsapp profile picture again. The problem is that when someone block another person, this person will always wonder whay this happened, will always wonder how comes he end to this situation. i thought every day "" i should have say this"". what i can say you is that time will heal your sorrow, and i was in your same situation, because i didn't have friends except that girl that blocked me, now i have only this other girl and i hope she won't block me"
