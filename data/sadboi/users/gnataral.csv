I’ve pretended to have a phone call way too many times. Like if people I know go past on a bus and I don’t want them to look at me while I’m walking. Ugh"

Every artist uses autotune, every record nowadays has subtle pitch correction because for everyone notes will be a few cents out unless you have perfect pitch. It’s just industry standard.

C25K,fo2yy6d,t1_fo2bpbk,1587477257.0,"Thank you! I found r/EOOD really inspiring and motivating. I just thought about the reasons I wanted to do this and how I wanted to do this for myself and how in 3 months time I would be so glad I started when I did. I wrote a list of reasons I wanted to start running: to be able to achieve and be proud of myself more often, to get exercise and fresh air, to improve my mental health, to become more confident, to have fun, to listen to great music and get good vibes etc. I told myself it would be such an achievement if I just went on a run. Just getting out of the door and into a run is an achievement so I was proud of myself any time I ran. I set myself the goal of being able to run a 5K in 9 weeks. Setting goals is motivating. Once you get into it it is easier to keep it up. Running can be quite addicting haha. To get myself motivated to get going I usually make a playlist on Spotify for my run which gets me pumped to go on my run. I have a running playlist full of uplifting and energetic songs that are sort of like musical berocca. I made a motivation board on Pinterest (my username is lozible if you want to check it out) with good quotes about running, and motivational quotes in general. A few of them are “I don’t need easy, I just need possible”, “The only person you need to compare yourself to is your yesterday self” and “Excuses are for people who don’t want it enough”. There is also a big post of 50 reasons to start running which was one of the big contributors to me wanting to start running: https://pin.it/3n4UwFl On my first ever C25K run I listened to From Now On from The Greatest Showman and I resonated with the lyrics “what’s waited til tomorrow starts tonight” and “let this promise in me start like an anthem in my heart” sounds cheesy but that really motivated me too :)) If you’re thinking of doing C25K, the best way is just to get started and you will soon be progressing and then before you know it you will be half way to your 5K goal! Good luck to you, I know you can do this!! You will be brilliant!! 💖"

I just thought about the reasons I wanted to do this and how I wanted to do this for myself and how in 3 months time I would be so glad I started when I did. C25K should have you running at a pace where you could still keep up a conversation with someone, so it shouldn’t be too hard. Though the runs get longer, it does get easier. Just think what an achievement it would be if you even went out on a run. Just getting out of the door and into a run is an achievement. Be proud of yourself just for going on a run regardless of if you complete the run or go at a quick pace. Couch to 5K is gradual and shouldn’t be too hard. I set myself the goal of being able to run a 5K in 9 weeks. Setting goals is motivating. Once you get into it it will be easier to keep it up. Running can be quite addicting haha.
