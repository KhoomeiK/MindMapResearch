AsianParentStories,fqmx66f,t1_fqms3kp,1589485016.0,"You can't control what other people do but you have control over what you do.

Every person is different. My spouse has had a parent die and says that I'll feel differently when it happens to me. I don't miss my mom much and I'm not sure that I'll miss her a ton assuming she goes before me, as sad as that sounds.

I've spent tons of time with my mom before and she's type A and I'm an introvert. I don't get her and we don't really find the same things important. 

In the past my mom has been the type of person to call me almost every day and sometimes call 2 or 3 times in a row trying to get me to pick up the phone. I try to have some boundaries for myself for my own mental health. I can talk to her a few times a week but I am not going to talk to her every day.

She often wants me to drop what I'm doing to let her video chat the kids and can be pushy. Sometimes we're eating or I'm nursing or busy in some other way. Or I just don't feel like talking. Putting my foot down is always going to be a challenge for me.

I have had many times where she pushed too far and I felt like I never wanted to see or talk to her again. Because by your reaction she will know you are upset and she is sorry she didn't get away with it, but doesn't actually understand what she did wrong. I don't think she's a genuinely remorseful person. And I don't want her to influence my kids too much. Sometimes she tries to put ideas in the older one's head hoping it will get me to say yes...when she should be talking to me, the mom about it first.

This barely skims the surface of it but the two main points are taking responsibility for your own actions and trying to set and reinforce boundaries. 

I have to be careful that my mood after talking to my mom doesn't affect how I am with my spouse. I get in a really bad mood sometimes from it and it's tough. She can be very negative and I often tell myself that I will tell her next time I dont want to talk about these things. 

And the boundaries are really hard because after a while my mom will act like I forgot about them or that they don't exist anymore. Its just hard. And about as exhausting as trying to look after a 3rd kid. When she visits I feel like I have another kid here. 

My mom took me to therapy when my dad left. I would never go to therapy with my mom and she doesn't believe in it anyway. She'll make everything about her, pretend to listen to the therapist, and then ignore it anyway. There is such a stigma surrounding mental health. I don't know your mom so that is up to you. 

My former pastor said that there are some people you have to love from a distance and sometimes I feel that way about my mom, though at least we're not estranged. There are some family members I'm estranged from. I don't take any joy in that, its just an unfortunate situation."
AsianParentStories,fqlmjl4,t1_fql19gj,1589461738.0,"Therapy definitely helps. I didn't want to be like my mom and I try to raise my kids the way I would have wanted to be raised. It also helps that my spouse will tell me when I need to check myself. There is no way he would let me parent our kids the way I was. My mom was abusive to my dad too. 

I also found that motherhood comes easier to me than it maybe did for my mom. She's not the most nurturing or hands on person. She doesn't know how to change a diaper or make a bottle. 

While I get frustrated with the kids, I don't feel the need to scream and curse like my mom did. I try not to take my family for granted...my mom definitely did and thats why my dad and I eventually left. I literally thought one of them would kill each other one day and apparently my aunts and uncles were afraid my mom might try to kill me after my dad left her. 

I'm not 100% over my childhood. When I'm around my mom I'm a different person and I barely talk. She gets to me even when she's not doing anything. Even though we're in a much better place now it's still hard to reconcile it with the mom I had growing up."

thingsmykidsaid,fq7wgch,t1_fq7st95,1589153613.0,"I think some of it might be attributed to social class plus a lack of interest to learn. They are mostly white collar workers. My mom's family had help growing up and people to cook for them. 

One of her sisters (she has 4 sisters) has 2 kitchens - one for the servants to cook in and another one that is nicer that they use that I've never actually seen them cook in, but they do use the fridge. So while ice seen my aunt go shopping for ingredients, I've only ever had her servant's cooking. At the same time my mom's other sister took an interest to it and now she's a chef.

I think my dad's side of the family all know how to cook though. My dad knows how to cook but he never taught me. One day my mom's other other sister was visiting when I was about 13 and she thought it was funny that I'd never cooked an egg before so she taught me. 

Do I find it very strange that my mom never tried to learn how to cook? Absolutely. When I was growing up we mostly ate fast food or at restaurants. I had only ever had home cooked meals at other people's homes. 

The lack of home cooking is one of the more innocent things that I envy about others. Even when people complain that their mom's cooking is bad."

Another hard thing is I have a 5 year old and I'm always self conscious about giving one of them too much and the other too little.

She'll let dad give her milk at night but she won't take it from him in the morning. She was pawing at his chest for 20 minutes.

Holding her hand doesn't work. She's strong. I tried putting something else in her hand and it worked once. Lately I just cover my other nipplr with my hand lol.

I've been over the breastfeeding for a while. But if I don't do it she gets really upset. A few months ago I was able to drop 2 feedings and it all ramped up again and next thing I knew I was doing it on demand again. I just get so tired doing it and sometimes my brain feels a little fuzzy and then she's also trying to tweak my nipples or constantly changing from one boob to the next.

I could slay my mom with words if I really wanted to. But even thinking about it makes me sad. The other day she said it's scary outside and she's on it so much every phone call that I never tell her that we go hiking or on walks because she would bug out.

I wanted to tell her what was really scary was my childhood. Sexual abuse for years that my parents were oblivious to, watching her physically and verbally and emotionally abuse my dad, and she abused me but not really physically. I pretty much wanted to die every day since middle school and was so depressed and wished I had my friends moms instead. 

She has close to zero maternal instinct. Has never changed either of my kids diapers because she doesn't know how and had zero interest in learning how.

90dayfianceuncensored,fmwqcvy,t1_fmwmuad,1586451164.0,In the Philippines there actually is a very specific way to great your elders (I know he's technically older but) and bowing ain't it.
AsianParentStories,fmv0jed,t3_fwvqde,1586403116.0,I'm Filipino and my parents don't really apologize. Especially my mom...she'll just cry and beg you to talk to her again and not be mad anymore.
AsianParentStories,fmv0con,t3_fwvnxr,1586402992.0,"I'm a miserable person around my mom and I'm more quiet around my dad. If I'm around my mom too much I take it out on my spouse and it's just how she makes me feel. Almost everything is a criticism or telling me what to do. Everything she thinks is right and she doesn't get anyone else's point of view.. 

I'm 30 and her helicopter parenting stunted me as a kid so what good will it do to me as an adult?"
90DayFiance,fmnlik3,t1_fmnhs7u,1586228869.0,Oooh I miss the greek food.
AsianParentStories,fmgqni0,t3_fv0vcp,1586055275.0,My mom is definitely a textbook one. It's weird because most of her siblings seem so normal. Probably doesnt help that she's the eldest.
90dayfianceuncensored,fmdbu0u,t1_fm6u8sg,1585963956.0,She's actually Filipino but idn what the norm is over there. Filipinos can be very westernized.
90dayfianceuncensored,fm5z2x1,t1_fm52wyk,1585782892.0,Same. Meanwhile I was at my mom's house once on a non-summer day and she told me I needed to shave my legs.
90dayfianceuncensored,fm5z04p,t1_fm52g9w,1585782846.0,Funny. I'm the opposite. I've maybe shaved my armpits once all winter. At this point I might make it all the way to summer depending on how the pandemic pans out.
AsianParentStories,flw9tty,t3_frbdoe,1585543677.0,"I was one of the kids that my parent's friends would compare their son to. I know this because he mentioned it to other classmates before and he hated me for it at the time.

I did really well in school and then burned out pretty fast and become a mediocre student with a lot of issues regarding depression and anxiety and later on ptsd. I played a lot of instruments and had a lot of extracurriculars and was very obedient. 

I do have some secrets but idn how much other people know. My mom pressured me to become a pharmacist like her and I didn't know what I wanted to do and went along with it. I left the program after a semester and transferred schools where I did fine for 2 years until the PTSD (was abused by years by a relative) hit really hard and I lost a semester. Then I moved in with my then boyfriend who I had only known for a few months. I think a part of me hoped they'd disown me which they didn't do.

My parents are divorced and I moved without telling them. They found out after 2 months and were really worried at first but 10 years later the bf and I are married with 2 kids."
AsianParentStories,flw9afn,t1_flvn8mu,1585543227.0,"To be fair, they could always just eat restaurant food. My mom still cannot cook anything and she's in her 60s. And I mean nothing. She just eats out a lot or eats freezer meals."
ZoeysPlaylist,flm0olh,t3_fplrcj,1585271873.0,"The first episode autoplayed on my fb. I was skeptical but was bored and watched it all and felt like the show had a lot of heart. 

I like Peter Gallagher because of Grace and Frankie and saw Skylar Astin on broadway and in Pitch Perfect and Crazy Ex Girlfriend. So knowing who some of these actors are made me intrigued. I also watched Alex Newell back when he was on The Glee Project."
AsianParentStories,fllcqft,t1_flcd58s,1585257844.0,Thanks but this is nothing lol. Not for me anyway.
JUSTNOMIL,fllcn2u,t1_fll949k,1585257792.0,"I seriously question if my mom changed a single diaper on me my whole babyhood. I have 2 kids, one is 5 and one is 1 and a half and she has not changed a single diaper. She doesn't know how. Could never figure out how to prepare a bottle either for my kids even though she wanted to help but couldn't bother to learn. Which is weird because I was a formula baby too...

At least my mom is a pharmacist and not a nurse for babies but it is still mind boggling."
JUSTNOMIL,flkfzep,t3_fpafbz,1585240204.0,On a side note my aunt has been giving her kid coke since she was a toddler which is really weird since said aunt is a pediatrician.
JUSTNOMIL,flkfka9,t1_flk0zhs,1585239975.0,I would be noping the heck out of that relationship. He is being so disrespectful and mean to you and it's just one text.
riverdale,fliop76,t1_fli82cm,1585187150.0,Emilio was on my list for a boy but I ended up with 2 girls.
AsianParentStories,flcb5sq,t3_fnm0nq,1585024916.0,Both my parents seem to think that I let my kid play too much and that I don't have her do enough academic extracurriculars. She's in preschool.
