Ive also heard of imagining a crystal or orb or light etc of the corresponding color.  As you breath in the color grows more vibrant .

We took it slow and now 3 years later it is still sometimes weird but it keeps getting better. Just like any other relationship communication is vital. I'd suggest getting comfortable with nonsexual physical intimacy before moving on. Also dont force anything because you feel like you have to. If you or your partner aren't comfortable it wont be good. Once you're there though your friendship and lo e for one another could make it the best sex ever. I speak from experience  :)

None of it was true nor did I actually believe it. He broke up with me later that day. It woke me up to how I acted and treated people. I have been working hard to change ever since and live a life of kindness and empathy. We reunited a few months later and I conveyed to him how sorry I was and how I had changed who I was because of it. We remained close friends for years until his now fiance forbade him from interacting with me. I regret the pain I caused but without the realization it brought I wouldn't be the person I am."
