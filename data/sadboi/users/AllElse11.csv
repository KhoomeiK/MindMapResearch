1. Take what you know, don't invent what you don't know. 

2. The fear, horror, the scares. That's secondary, it's the story that is important. 

3. What scares you? Use that. Use your life and use who you are. 

4. You want a good start? Monsters? Are they monsters? Have you ever been a monster in your life? Who were you a monster to. There's a start. Go get em."

Perhaps they receive chemical burns from fluoride.  It's also never discussed the complete reason why they came, all is shown in the movie is they came, dragged a few folk off and then left. As there's a reference in a radio announcement of a family being taken from their home, yes there is also a reference made to the Aliens being defeated by a primitive weapon, which we assumed was water; but considering how much water there is on the planet it would make sense that, like the people who watched the movie, the people in the movie made the initial assumption that it was purely water, but I don't think so. We treat our water with all kinds of things, maybe one of those things causes a chemical burn when it comes into direct contact with the Alien's skin. Perhaps they visited as a large party of scientists to observe and take back a few humans for study, which to us seemed like an invasion. As it must do when when we into some new environment, we go in, we,look about, take specimens and bugger off."

Can take months but isolated in the middle of nowhere, perhaps left for two or three days. No food, no contact, stuck in your own filth. Till you're hosed off and the cage is moved to a cleaner spot.

Many spiders are lethal and if they ever got together, made a pact where they wouldn't eat each other till humans were wiped out, I reckon they'd have a good shot at doing us in.  There's also the fact that people are already frightened of spiders, so in many cases they could terrify us into doing stupid things, which isn't too difficult. Imagine if they all hid in our cars, yep, a couple of spidies hiding in everyone's car, all jumping out at the same time when everyone is tired, and speeding down the motorway one morning!!!! There's also the fact that some of the more lethal variety of spider in the black widow family are small. Tiny little guys like the red back spider could sneak into your room via a vent, and give you a little nip in your sleep. Hell get two or three to have a nibble of your ear. And if we managed to defeat the spiders we'd then have the problem of having too many insects, so even if we win we lose. And spiders are also multi talented, the Sydney funnel web while not one for predominantly spending its life underwater, is capable of going navy seal. They can create an air bubble and lie in wait, which is why people in and around Sydney have to becareful when getting into their pool. Spiders are hardy and while they are vulnerable to the old Mortein fly spray, they can survive incredible amounts of damage and injury, even losing limbs or the odd eye here and there. Spiders have more than one eye, and sometimes more than one type of eye, which helps to make them such effective killers. Yep, if they all found ways to use their different abilities to coordinate attacks we'd be in some trouble."
