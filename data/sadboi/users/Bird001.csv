SampleSize,fnlosm3,t1_fnkomvy,1587057156.0,Wow I never knew that. That's cool.
SampleSize,fnki4o9,t1_fnkbd3q,1587027928.0,Yeah I wonder why that is the case. Honestly don't know. Guess our brains don't want to choose the outer ones as much.

VRchat,fnkgffh,t1_fnk4yhw,1587026089.0,Did you try launching in desktop?  That might help narrow down the problem.
VRchat,fnkg8kv,t3_g2aq0m,1587025886.0,"If you don't feel comfortable talking at first, you could use text to speech. Once you find a friend or two, you can stop using tts and get more comfortable with using your voice. Also, having to type it all up instead of just saying it might make you just want to start talking. 

If you don't want to use tts, you can probably do some 1 on 1 talking with someone hiding in the back of a world, if you dislike huge groups. I find that 1 on 1 can be easier since less people are hearing you.

Also, funny or interesting avatars are great for making friends. 

I'm also new to vrchat and while I am not in the situation as you, I know for a fact that there are a lot of chill people to talk to, and there's a lot of new players because of the quarantine and popular streamers playing vrchat.

There are a lot of different voices and people in vrchat, I am sure you will fit right in. Hope this helps somewhat."

depression,fngpimv,t1_fngdn6t,1586940171.0,"Yeah it seems that our brains want to avoid unusual experiences. I have social anxiety, and I have been dumped by a friend group before, and so I have trust issues. Whenever someone is being nice to me, or I am enjoying someone else's company, I feel really weird and sort of uncomfortable. Like my brain is saying, ""this is unusual, avoid it"". It makes it hard to find new friends."
Dermatology,fism6k3,t3_f9ky5b,1582687662.0,"Not a dermatologist but I get dry skin a lot. It might be mild atopic dermatitis which can be caused by an irritant (friction, strong soaps, cleaners, etc). Also stress can be a factor contributing to dry and itchy skin."
socialanxiety,fg955m9,t3_exdx21,1580634299.0,Most ppl just gaze off somewhere. No one actually cares because most people are too busy looking at their phones or trying to figure out what to have for lunch. Personally I have been trying to look at my phone less so I just look a few directions and switch every once in awhile.  If there is an interesting object I might look at it for awhile. Idk. It's such a small thing to other people and I think it is important to understand other people's perspectives.
socialanxiety,fg92yt6,t3_exkvde,1580633565.0,True
buildapcforme,f8t3pvl,t1_f8sqwuz,1574795130.0,What about a GTX 1660 super (~$230) though? RX 580 is a good card but with that budget you could probably go higher. Even a regular 1660 (~$210) or an RX 590 (~$180) would be better.
