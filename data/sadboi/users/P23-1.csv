No freedom of speech. The glorification of China's past is part of that, for instance, so LN must be doing pretty well with their glamorous Chinese classical dresses in abundance. I'm not sure why, but China has been suppressing and incarcerating Muslims within China, and is suppressing content about Islam. You can look up Uighurs to know more.

The good news is that nowadays there are modern therapies coming out that are quite effective for trauma, even childhood trauma. Look up psychedelic assisted therapies.

You know, now that's he has a conviction record, and there are *two* people who can give independent testimony... Might be worth consulting with a lawyer to see what options you have to get him convicted for his crimes against you and your cousin, too. Maybe you could find a lawyer with experience in the field who knows how to handle these difficult things and can tell you what your odds are. Not saying that you need to do anything, of course, just that your options are better now that they used to be. Personally, when I learned that someone else had experienced the same thing I went through, I think that kept me alive. And another thing, I haven't been able to talk about it because I choke up and seize up, but I've requested to do it via text and some agreed to communicate with a safe texting app instead of talking. Using a separate app (like Signal) helps keep it somewhat separate from the rest of my life. 


I know this might not be helpful at all, but my first thought was, if this somehow would make it so that the other people in prison know what he's accused of... That's a very different prison experience."
getting_over_it,fottz9q,t3_g9eq2g,1588066057.0,"My answer may sound simple even though I know that being in the situation is incredibly difficult. Your mom has a life-threatening disease. Of the type where her brain gets inflamed. It's potentially deadly. Are you in a country that has any options for mental health treatment and care? If yes, tell her that you need her to get treatment. To see a doctor (a real doctor who can prescribe things, ideally a psychiatrist) and a therapist. Don't just suggest that she might feel better or that it could be helpful for her, because If she's depressed, she may not care about her own wellbeing or happiness at all. Instead, tell her and everyone else in your home that you need this to happen. You can make it clear that you have needs and one need of yours is that she engages in some treatment. It is reasonable to not want to be traumatized by a sudden suicide, and it is not reasonable to take on the responsibility yourself when that is a job for professionals (and not even professionals can save every single life, sadly). People often come up with concerns, like it's too expensive or it's embarrassing or whatever, in this case none of that matters because this is 100% where treatment could be a matter of life and death. Shop around if the first doctor is no good. If you had a cancer patient at home, you would spare no effort to get them treatment, too, right? Is a possibility that she'll say no, of course, and that she's too far gone to listen, and that she won't do it even for someone else. In that case, the counseling is for you and your family. Having someone close that is unwilling to meet our needs around something so essential is a difficult thing. My heart goes out to you."
