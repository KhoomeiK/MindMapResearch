NarcissisticAbuse,fc8pdvy,t1_fc83fs9,1577539556.0,"Thank you. The power parents have to influence their child's life is tremendous,. I think most parents want the best for their child(ren). Even those with horrendous behaviors, like mine, I think they did the best they knew how at the time. That's the thinking I use, how I've come to not hold onto resentments. At least tooo many lol. It's not easy. It's taken some years and, in fact, my father's death, to open my eyes and heart further. Luckily a month or so before he passed, I had gone through a bit of an awakening in my life (through many bad decisions). I had the opportunity to tell him that I ""saw"" him and I wasn't going to be his puppet on a string any longer.... After his death, I see the evil from him, oozing from my brother's. It's always been there. I'm just more awake, aware. It's sad, but I'm thankful I can see it a little more from a distance rather than still be all consumed by it, especially as an adult with my own family now. Now I have to deal with my extended family NOT understanding the workings of our disfunctional family....n how my brother's continue to abuse my mom, just like dad did. It's horribly sad."
