AskReddit,fft7o0x,t3_ev0jdd,1580211176.0,"It probably sounds funny and even stupid, but... once I had a birthday party, I was very young (6 or 7 I think) and my parents gave me a Barbie doll as a gift. The doll also had ""pets"" - three little toy kittens that I loved even more than the doll, and so did one of my friends who were at the party. We spent the whole day playing dolls and these kittens, then my Mom called us to eat a cake and then my friend went home. When she was gone, I noticed that the three kittens were also gone. At first I thought we lost them under the pile of other toys or something and I searched desperately for them because I just fell in love with them really. I didn't find them (even though I searched through every possible thing and my parents helped me of course and searched the flat with me), so I suspected that my friend stole them as she loved them just as much. We had a great agrument about it because she of course denied my accusations but I somehow was super sure it was her. As time went on we became friends again, but up to this day I wonder where the hell these kittens went, because if I really just somehow lost them I blamed an innocent person."

I kept functioning like a robot - attended classes, talked to friends, played games but didn't feel any emotional feedback, I literally stopped enjoying the things I used to love so much. I could spend a whole day in bed just watching the ceiling. Then I started having problems with my sleep pattern and my life turned into an actual nightmare as I developed panick attacks and could all of a sudden feel extremely nervous and anxious. These two conditions - apathy and anxiety - kept replacing each other and after a while I finally got my ass to the doctor because I realised I couldn't fix it myself. I got diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder and keep fighting it to this day."

mentalhealth,f8jx3tn,t3_e0xumk,1574605160.0,"Hi there. Your story is really sad because the doctor you hoped would help you in fact didn't do it. It can unfortunately happen for different reasons - sometimes doctors are incompetent, sometimes you two just can't get the right way to talk, you know, meeting the right doctor is almost like making a friend - some people have common vibes with you, some people don't. I would suggest that you should look for another therapist, it might take time but eventually you will come across someone you can trust and who can really help you. 

My idea is, please don't think there is something wrong with you or what you did/said. It was just not the right person, that's all. Whatever you decide to do - to look for another therapist or go straight to a psychiatrist or else - I truly believe that your choice will be the best for you and you will get over all the issues you're struggling with. You can do it and you will!"

I think there were German soldiers who didn't really want it all but how could they disobey? There are just broken families and dead civilians and lost relatives and friends and a lot of pain caused by each nation to each nation. There were good and bad people on each side, just like there are good and bad people everywhere nowadays, you can't judge a person by their nationality only. So... I agree, there were things done by the Soviet army too that cannot be justified and I'm not justifying them, if you read my message again, I'm just saying that I'm happy the war is over and we live in peace now.

todayilearned,f5kfr4d,t1_f5kdzbo,1572262322.0,"Greetings, good sir! Okay, so I'm 24, obviously I was born after the collapse of the USSR and I have no memories of those times, so all I know about the USSR is something I learned from books, culture, etc. Personally I don't think the times were super great, you know, considering the Iron Curtain with no chances for people to leave the USSR, also the market was horribly poor and I rememeber that because when I was born (1995) and basically throughout 90s it was hard to buy... well, anything. Kids had no toys, people wore the same clothes, all the furniture was the same. And yeah, the brainwashers in the government... Maybe there were good points to this too, I mean, otherwise we wouldn't have played such a big role in the WW2, but... it scares me to death when I hear people from the older generations (people who actually lived in the USSR and witnessed those times) say ""Oh I wish the USSR came back"". I surely don't want it back. And honestly, I don't think much has changed since the collapse. Yeah the market is better and all, but hey, people still believe that ""you should be like everyone else"" and ""if you're different in any way it's bad"", that's why Russia is a homophobic place with people tied closely to their traditions. But the younger generations are more open. I'd say give it twenty years and the whole atmosphere will be different. It takes time and the process is slow, but things are changing. Yeah we have the opposition jailed everytime someone tries to protest against political dictatorship, but the main point is that we finally have the opposition, we have people who think differently and not just obey Putin's ideas. I hope that was useful. Feel free to ask me questions if I haven't clarified something you would like to know."
