AskReddit,fr5htg1,t3_gmlkr7,1589908794.0,I was smoking pot with my roommate in my college and the security came to our room for a whole different reason. They caught us and now I'm expelled.
nfrealmusic,fkjhfwn,t1_fkj4ity,1584246024.0,I think I'm gonna go with The Search. The beat drop is kinda sick.
nfrealmusic,fkf4k4t,t1_fkf4h15,1584126918.0,"Yeah, it's a great song. And I can do the fast verses too. Just the chorus I'm a little worried about."
nfrealmusic,fkf0aly,t1_fkf0395,1584124409.0,The Search and When I grow up were my go to songs too. The only issue with When I grow up is the chorus coz it overlaps the verses a little.
nfrealmusic,fkeyijr,t1_fkeyfbu,1584123354.0,"Sure. I'm kinda nervous tho, It's my first time performing on stage."

depression,ffumxa5,t3_evb1ni,1580245340.0,I've never seen a post that so accurately describes my situation.
depression,ffumjb7,t3_evb9je,1580245111.0,I feel exactly the same. I feel like I'm happy when I'm with friends laughing about dumb shit but as the laughter fades I feel a wave of sadness take over me in an instance and it's the worst feeling because no matter what I do it's always is ready to take over me.
depression,ffum7nj,t3_evbd60,1580244916.0,"I know how you feel. I've been in this state for a while now. I get up and go to sleep and I feel like I do absolutely nothing productive during the day. I've thought about death over and over again but I always think to myself that maybe it will get better. I look at so many people even on this subreddit that have gone through hell in their lives but still somehow find the will to live. I know it feels like there's a dead end on this road and you feel like you should rather quit than to even try at all but if you quit, you'll never know what could have been. If you quit in a game just because you lost a few times than you'll never find out how it ends. I'm not saying that it's a certain happy ending. But it's worth the effort. Hang in there."
depression,ffullfk,t3_enrs4c,1580244538.0,Thank you for writing this post. I too always think that I'm just trying to get their attention and I never put anything that I feel into words because I think that I'm just annoying them. So I just convince myself that this is not depression and it's just a temporary wave of sadness. But this wave has been here for over 2 years and I still can't accept the fact that I should talk to someone about it and I just bottle it up.
nfrealmusic,ffujkv3,t1_ffui4fi,1580243317.0,"Yeah, but lately I feel like I'm listening to songs just to avoid talking to myself."
MCPE,fb7stss,t3_ebvtxa,1576598577.0,I have been looking for a mature and active server for so long. I'd be down for that.
