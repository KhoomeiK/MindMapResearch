Battlefield,eqhn46x,t3_byg2pa,1560064810.0,"I was one of those who join the bandwagon because of the reveal trailer. However, after the pacific theater reveal trailer i purchased the game and i was amazed that the game is a lot better than bf1 imo. Bfbc2, bf3 and bf4 were superior but for me bf5 is still a great game. One thing i would like the devs to fix is the spotting of the enemies. But that's just my opinion though."
