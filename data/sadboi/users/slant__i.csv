But you’re definitely right, there will probably will be some testimonies...

Aside from all that tho, I know in CA that if you get caught doing unlicensed electrical work(meaning not a licensed electrician) you can get fined and lose your ability to do electrical work legally for 7 years I think.  I assume it’s true of the other trades and not just in CA.

Idk, seems like a lot will be up to the discretion of the people who handle the case.  Should be interesting to see how it all plays out.  I hope for the sake of everyone involved Joe gets some sense in him and starts doing legit business."
AfterPrisonShow,fqzm0rm,t3_gls4ce,1589770178.0,"It wouldnt be all the work, as things like cleaning and some of the simpler tasks can be done without a license.  Also, there will be some discrepancies as to who is actually in violation, as I don’t think everyone working for an unlicensed contractor is liable of all these charges.  

With the exception of electrical and plumbing work, I think most the stuff rabbit did would fall on Joe.  Even some of the responsibility of the unlicensed work done will likely fall on Joe, as he facilitated it all, repeatedly and knowingly at that.  Gelico is probably in the same boat as rabbit, sitting in legal grey area because it was all handshake agreements and they never claimed to be licensed tradesmens or contractors.  Meaning a lot of their responsibility will probably fall on Joe who was the one truly functioning as an unlicensed contractor.  Peewee?, who I believe was just doing mostly labor work under the supervision of Joe and Brian, then later the GC, will probably be ok.

If the GC joe hired is actually licensed, along either the master electrician, they will probably take the biggest hit after Joe. 

If it goes to court, a lot of it will come down to evidence, which unfortunately for the offending parties there is a boat load.  But at the same time, I’m not really sure how much resource they will use to track down and prosecute everyone when it’s pretty much an open and closed case with Joe, who is the primary offender in this case.  I could be wrong, but I’d surprised if they go after more than just the few running the show."

If you can already prove you have what it takes to hold down a job in construction(labor work likely), you are much less of a gamble to hire.  Show a willingness for all aspects of the job, especially things like digging and sweeping at first.  I’m not sure what the current market looks like, but I know most commercial solar hires local labor through recruiters like temp agencies.  Not a bad place to start out, I met quite a few electricians and people who used those hours to count toward the journeyman test. The pay is generally pretty low compared to other electrical work, but if you get in with a good company they will take care of you(few and far between ime).

I’ve heard some trying to get in for months even up to years.  Easiest way is to find an electrical contractor that is willing to give you a shot.  Most probably won’t care about any degree, as it’s unrelated to what they will be hiring you for.  Even trade schools aren’t taken all that serious compared to real experience.

Potentially a design flaw but it’s also possible a combination of circumstances are coming together to prevent a short, like blades on trimmer being coated in something non conductive and the cable being made of material that prevents arcing when cut(maybe fiberglass paper stuff).

OP mentioned only 2 wires(hot, neutral), which seems illegal to me considering it has 3 prongs(hot, neutral, ground).  

Either way, it’s pretty unusual to be able to cut a live circuit with hot and neutral together, and NOT cause a short which should trip breakers.  I’m not totally familiar with fuses but I would think such a short should be enough to pop fuses- although I think the arc would need to be sustained longer to pop a fuse than breaker.

Also, could be a result of faulty wiring that the unit was plugged into, rather than result of faulty unit itself.  If similar wiring conditions(old, etc) it’s possible but seems less likely."

AfterPrisonShow,fpc1qew,t3_g4rea0,1588484841.0,"I’ve been watching from the start and I’ll start out by saying my favorite part about the show is seeing Joe grow as a person, from pure prison mentality telling war stories and working dead end jobs, to buying houses, starting businesses, and trying to help others in similar shoes.  I think Joe has come a long way and that alone serves as a lot of motivation to change myself, as Joe shows what can be done in spite of a criminal record.  Whether successful or not, he doesn’t let his past hold him back.  It seems clear Joe, although far from perfect, tries to be a genuine and good person.


Admittedly it can be pretty frustrating watching Joe fuck up, especially when it’s something like construction that I (and a lot of other viewers) know quite well.  Even more frustrating when he seems to ignore advice given(not the comments, can’t expect him to take advice from hundreds of random comments) or repeat the same mistakes/not learn from mistakes.  Honestly though, it’s entertaining seeing how Joe handles these situations.  It’s definitely much easier to sit back and point out mistakes than it is to be the one making decisions.  However, I think a large part of the problem is who Joe chooses to surround himself with.

And this brings me to what I think is the real issue here.  The channel is obviously focused on people with criminal records doing better for themselves.  This is a good thing, however, being that the APS has already been duped by scammers and cons a few times before, I think most are naturally suspicious and extra vigilant.  Things like Gelico and rabbit using drugs, and Joe not catching it until they basically got themselves caught.  Then quickly glossing over it, even defending rabbits highly suspicious behavior.  This is what I think makes people upset and angry at Joe, leaving people feeling scammed if they donated, or looking like a scammer because he’s taking money and giving it to people who appear to be using.  There are so many unaddressed red flags with rabbit, and although a noble friend, Joe is on the wrong side of the fence with this one.  There is just way too much to list with Rabbit alone, and at this point I’d be far more surprised if he was still sober than if he wasn’t.  I don’t pray for his downfall, but I also have been around enough to know the signs.  So many people saw the BS with Gelico coming long before, yet Joe ignored the signs as well, even made videos where Gelico feeds viewers his lines of BS.  That’s the type of shit I can’t stand, and the type of stuff that I think leads to a lot of the negative comments.  These people make the audience feel like fools, feel like we are being lied to and the only way to lash out is in comments.

Not to mention they make Joe look like a damn fool for believing and backing these bullshiters.  The first few- fine, we are all human.  But now i see a lot wondering if Joe just doesn’t know what a junkie looks/behaves like.  To me, it seems like he just keeps rabbit around because he (was) popular with viewers, and I’m not sure who else is going to be down to be filmed on their part time job.  

Just the fact that rabbit is so willing to come work half days, turned down a real job because he didn’t want to spend the 200 donated to him, and doesn’t seem to be looking for a full time job that has a future for him(health insurance, steady hours, retirement) is a huge red flag in itself. If nothing else, seems pretty short sighted of him.  Kinda sucks to say, but APS seems to only serve as help transitioning to a better life.  Like How Dave has to move on with his life to grow, I think the same will be true of anyone unless Joe decides to share ownership of one of his companies(and the company successfully grows).  Otherwise I don’t see how working for Joe is beneficial long term, only a paycheck mostly.  Joe reaps the majority of the work here and that’s just the nature of owning a business.  That said, it’s a not a good job for anything beyond a stepping stone to something better.  There’s not clear path to progress, and it’s not even clear if there will be work or even a business a few months from now.  That’s a lot to gamble your future on, especially when you have no chance of owning the business."
AfterPrisonShow,fpbylgv,t1_fpbnxc4,1588482196.0,"Yeah I think that might be even more infuriating.  The problem isn’t not reading the comments, it’s overconfidence and a lack of skill.  Perfect example is painting- he even states in a video the advice he was given then a few minutes later shows rabbit doing the opposite.  He needs to hire a consultant who isn’t doing any work just to teach him if he plans on continuing this work and doesn’t want to throw money away.  Some very basic info, like not working out of order(ex: floors before paint) would save him an immense amount of money."

solar,fp53089,t1_fp4ndyn,1588314662.0,"All very true.  Smart grid seemed over hyped by solar people when these concerns were brought up.  Definitely competing interests, and as long as the utility is public they will win unless mandated by the government.  Not sure what nationalizing the grid would look like, or if it’s even possible from a political perspective(might be too hot of a topic for most to touch).  It’s interesting watching this all play out, I think the recent laws(not sure what state) requiring new housing to have solar which was later revised to allow utilities to provide the solar from farms might be a sign of the direction.  If utilities owned the solar farms they would also have incentive to build a smart grid, of course then residential solar likely becomes much less appealing for the average home owner(which seems to drive much of solar legislature)."
solar,fp4khr4,t1_fp4gz6o,1588301039.0,"That’s what the smart grid is supposed to accomplish, but I haven’t really heard anything about it recently.  Google search pulls articles from 2012 for me.

Either way, I would think all states and places looking to implement something like a smart grid will have to make that decision if they’re going to rely on lithium batteries for storage.  Seems we met a practical/ethical limit to chemical storage, maybe other methods will become more viable."
