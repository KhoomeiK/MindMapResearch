The contents of the show are used to decide its meaning, and that's always open to interpretation. And just to be clear: there's a plethora of homosexual subtext between the two, and I don't think any argument against that will hold much water. But subtext is subtext: it's implicit, not explicit.

The ratings in Season 1 were so bad they would have been justified in canceling after a few episodes, but they believed in it and kept it going. Same with Season 2.

And can you imagine how terrible it would be if the series ended at the Season 1 finale? How eye-gougingly infuriating it would have been to have had to deal with the Season 2 finale as the series finale? The horror.

Season 3 at least somewhat functions as the end to the overall story, depending on how one wants to interpret it. The people that really deserve shade thrown at them are the fans who pirated the show instead of watching the broadcast or on streaming."

In the movies, I always got the impression that he does need the hammer to fly, but that he controls it telepathically, so he can ""fly"" in whatever direction he wants. There are fight scenes where the hammer flies around in a circle, so it can't be as simple as throw-n-return. I think it's a telekinetic relationship. 

But then in Ragnarok, Thor explicitly says that he ""flew"" by holding on to his hammer after its thrown. 

BUT! in Endgame, just after the ""you have the little one"" gag with Cap, we see Thor jump into the air with a lightning boost, which looks an awful lot like flying, without the aid of Stormbreaker being thrown. 

I think he can fly now after the power boost from Ragnarok. But I also think Marvel has been pretty inconsistent on the subject."

HannibalTV,fonmddv,t3_g6ir4l,1587922260.0,"Yes. I worry that a 4th season would feel less like an inventive continuation and more like a subpar imitation of itself, and that concern grows as more time passes. 

I also worry that with time Fuller is becoming more influenced by the fans' interpretations of the characters and the world, and it would color the direction and execution of the story. (I know some fans might take umbrage with this, but I'm a firm believer that a creator should never use ""give the fans what they want"" as a guiding force.)

I worry that, according to their original plan, Hannibal was supposed to be in Europe for 2 full seasons but the had to cut it down to a half season, so it's jarring to think about what the 7 season plan would look like. 5 seasons, I guess?

I worry about what could possibly happen in a season 4 that wouldn't completely destroy the build-up or destroy what we love about these characters. I know I'm going against the grain with much of the fanbase here, but for as much as Will and Hannibal have in common, I think they would make a terrible ""couple"". They're at their most interesting when there is repulsion mixed with their attraction. 

I worry about the whole Clarice thing. Getting her (and Buffalo Bill) or not is a total Catch 22, but it looks like that will never happen. 

And I worry about Fuller's seeming inability to stick to a project. I know it can't all be his fault, but I wonder if we can reasonably assume none of it is his fault? He said that working on an adaptation of Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles was a dream of his since high school, and he's actually friends with the family. He left that project. I mean... how? 

But... But I remind myself that Fuller at half his power is still better than most of the tripe on TV. So as long as I don't get my expectations too high or create any specific notion about what I think should happen in season 4, I'll be buying all in on it."
HannibalTV,fo70nr9,t1_fo6hb3p,1587570164.0,"I agree with many of your points, but I'm going to nitpick, if I may. 

First, I don't think ""love"" is the word I would use to describe Hannibal's motive for turning himself in. On the contrary, I think it was sickly abusive to Will, and even self-abusive to Hannibal himself. I think it was a  grotesque need to possess Will, and possibly the worst thing he's done in the entire series. (But no question that Hannibal did it out of a desire to ""have"" Will in some way; maybe we're dealing with slightly different concepts of what qualifies as ""love"", which is perhaps too pedantic a topic to really hammer out.)

And as I pointed out before, I love Fuller and his take on these characters, but I do think he's been very inconsistent with his commentary, particularly regarding the bromance between Will & Hannibal. I don't remember the exact quote, but he did say something that boils down to what he found most interesting about the pair was to explore just how close two male characters can platonically get without actually being overtly sexual or explicitly coupling-up. 

I'll also say that I don't have anything at all against a homosexual pairing on principle. But I see it being essentially a choice between 2 options: either the show about two men falling into a perverse and abusive romantic & sexual relationship together, OR its about exploring how close two men can platonically get and how deeply they can affect each other and be drawn to each other without it being explicitly romantic & sexual. 

Either option is interesting, but I find the second option to be much more interesting, which us ultimately why I prefer it."
HannibalTV,fo6ftft,t3_g5q6c9,1587557595.0,"I think it's complicated, like every other character attribute about the show.

Hannibal doesn't fit into any well-defined and simple box. People call him a psychopath, but he clearly displayed empathy for Will and Abigail. Bedelia describes Hannibal as ""the social antisocial"". And most obviously, he's a gentleman cannibal. I think his sexuality is no different. Hannibal is in constant pursuit of the beautiful and the fascinating and the wide range of pleasures life has to offers, so I don't think it makes sense for Hannibal to be purely heterosexual. He'd be open to physical contact with anyone if he found them interesting; the issue is that he finds so few people interesting or refined enough to want to be close to them physically. I think the closest I can come to defining Hannibal's sexuality is a form of pan-sapiosexuality: if someone can truly stimulate his mind, he's down. 

In short, Hannibal would absolutely be down to bang Will. 

But... I also don't think Hannibal is capable of ""love"" as we typically think of it in our culture. He's extremely abusive and possessive, and his motivations are more based in fascination than fondness. He does certainly long for Will, but I think part of that is his desire to not be bored.

As for Will, I think he's heterosexual. I don't think he's at all overtly attracted to Hannibal in a physical or sexual way, but he's intensely drawn to him in other ways. One of the most important lines of dialogue in a series overflowing with complex speech and double entendres is when Will tells Chiyoh, ""I've never known myself as well as I know myself when I'm with him."" It's my interpretation that Will has some pretty dark parts to himself, which he has always tried to repress. But along comes Hannibal and cracks his skull open and let's all the demons out, including the ones Will didn't know about. And while everyone else recoils at Will demons, Hannibal encourages and nurtures them. 

I think there's something very powerful about someone accepting you for who you are, including the darker parts. Something altogether more powerful about having those dark parts not just accepted, but embraced. 

All that being said, I think Will's heart skips a beat when he sees Hannibal. But he doesn't know how much of that is due to fondness and how much is fear or even hatred. Will is intensely drawn to Hannibal, in part because he finds him so interesting in a sea of boring pleabs (just as Hannibal does him). 

But... no, I don't think Will wants to bang Hannibal. Even straight men have gay encounters and they experiment, so a hookup is possible, but I think there's been too much abuse for Will to be open to that. 

Brian Fuller has said that there's a romance, but he's also said that Will is straight and nothing could ever happen between the two. I love Fuller's vision, but he's always struck me as a guy who wants to have his cake and eat it too, so I always take what he says with a grain of salt. (Hugh Dancy also says it's a platonic love, for what that's worth.)

All THAT being said, there's an insane amount of gay subtext and sexual subtext  surrounding these characters, and anyone who denies that is simply not paying attention. But subtext isn't overt-text, and so is open to interpretation. =)

Maybe one day we'll get a Season 4 and they'll be traveling Murder Husbands who have Big Gay Sexy Times and then it will be undeniable canon. Until then, my vote is, well, ""it's complicated."""

If Murder is Allowed: House 1 is by far the safest.

Backup is House 3; if I can kill Dolorhyde right out the gate, then the only competition for the attentions of Alan and Freddie would be Chilton, and I'm confident I'd come out on top. And Alana's down for 3-ways. 

If Murder is NOT Allowed: House 4 would be entertaining as hell, with all the catty banter. And as long as the pantry is full, there's no question the food would be quality. Backup is House 6; Will and I could train Randell to act like a dog.

HannibalTV,fnjp0c2,t3_g1o93b,1587003688.0,"I believe it was one of the episode commentaries wherein Fuller said that Hannibal never ""emotionally lies."" He won't pretend to be happy or sad when he's not, and he won't pretend to like someone that he doesn't (like Jack) to try to deflect suspicion or manipulate them. It's actually a crucial detail to fully understand the character.

That being said, Hannibal explicitly lies fairly rarely, all things considered. This is especially true during the second season while he's under suspicion from Jack, which is when you'd expect him to lie the most. It's actually pretty brilliant writing, because Hannibal knows that if he's a suspect his explicit denial means nothing, regardless of if he's a killer or not."
HannibalTV,fnjo80z,t3_g1rlga,1587003187.0,"Fuller's original plan was to have had Hannibal kill Mischa as well as eat her.

But Mads refused to go along with that idea, saying that Hannibal saw Mischa as God, and he would never do anything to hurt her. Brian changed the script after that. 

As for who killed her, I don't think Hanno AL has any reason to lie to Chiyoh; she's one of the few people who know who and what he is (or close enough). And the way the story played out, I got the impression that they both knew full well what the guy imprisoned in Lecter Castle did, and I never got the impression that there was uncertainty on Chiyoh's part. 

That being said, we may never know what specific circumstances transpired surrounding Mischa's death. I don't think Fuller wants to explain the monster too much."
