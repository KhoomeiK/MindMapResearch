My biggest change was in fitness level. Since November I slowly worked my way up from walking 30 min daily, to running 5k almost every day! I'm super proud of not being sedentary for the first time in my life and would love to share the psychological (mainly) changes I went throug in order to accomplish that. Dieting is a different story though. I really hate it. It would be so helpful to have encouragement! I've been posting about it on my Instagram but it feels like too much exposure/too little accountability. Please PM me if you're interested, I would be thrilled!

I think I was ten, and bullied relentlessly at school at the time, so the last thing I wanted was more attention. Nmom is a pianist so she was going to accompany me. She had to physically drag me crying to the event. When we got there I silently cried up until it was my turn to get onstage. When she realised there was no piano but a shitty Yamaha keyboard (duh, they're not gonna rent a Steinway for a school talent show) she decided it wasn't good enough for her, so I went on alone. It was terrifying and I was bullied about it after."

mentalhealth,fj9tggb,t3_fcac59,1583159177.0,"After living in the US for 15 years, my husband of 3 years convinced me to move back to Brazil with him (we are both Brazilian, met in NY). He got an excellent job offer here. My plan was to go back to school. Once we moved my depression worsened to the point where, while I was able to attend classes, I eventually withdrew from everything  and everyone and finally attempted suicide by ODing on pills. My husband announced he was leaving me while I was still in the ICU. I moved back in with my mother. By this point, my Greencard was no longer valid so I was stuck in Brazil with no relationship, job, money, prospects, nothing. I spent close to five months in bed.

 I am still living with my mother. Somehow, I found the strength to start exercizing just 30 min every day. Even if I spent the rest of the day in bed, I went on a 30 min walk/run. Then I added yoga to that. I went back to therapy. I started forcing myself to reach out to friends. Finally, I went to every English school in my city and dropped my resume saying I was looking for work as an English teacher. I got a job. I downloaded Tinder and started dating (this was particularly hard). In the past three months, I have created a foundation on which to rebuild my life. I may or may not try to move back to the US. My life changed radically because of a bad decision where I put the needs of someone I loved, and that I thought loved me, before my own. But here I am trying to make the best of it. I lost EVERYTHING. But I'm going to be ok."
