I don't think there was anything wrong with me suggesting that. 

My mom regretted me (not because I was autistic, I didn't get diagnosed until this year and I'm 26) and she told me so in various ways herself and she was abusive. I feel I would have been better off being raised by someone else.

Very few people are given the tools to really think about whether or not they are truly ready for parenthood and unfortunately, this person obviously didn't think it through and they are one of untold numbers of people who got into parenthood without realizing what it entails. I have done nothing wrong by suggesting that this might be a good idea for everyone involved. She is not simply ""upset"". Drinking and constantly crying are not little things. Stop being dismissive of what is going on here and acknowledge the fact that lots of people are born to parents who weren't ready for them. 

I was one of the few people on here who didn't try to tell her that it would automatically be alright. Maybe it won't be alright and she will be unhappy and the kid will feel it on some level. None of us can really know how good or bad this situation is, but from what they themselves shares with us, it looks pretty bad. There are people out there who adopt special needs kids and if this is something that she wants to do, I wanted to tell her it was an option without shaming her. It's not her fault that she wasn't prepared for this. Few people talk about this possibility and we should talk about it more so that people can make informed decisions."
confessions,fddwhlj,t1_fddtlml,1578325679.0,"Sadly, you are right. A lot of people think that parenthood is going to work out in a certain way and it often doesn't. Few are ready to have a disabled child and too many people have the idea that parenthood only ends up in not ideal situations for other people, but not for them. 

To be clear, I don't think that being disabled is a bad thing, but I know that most people don't set out to have a disabled child. I worked with disabled children and I couldn't handle it, so I decided not to have kids. I'm autistic myself and there is a chance that I could have an autistic kid with much higher support needs than I ever had, so I don't think I want to take the chance of having a biological child. If I ever change my mind, I would look at fostering or adopting. 

You are correct in that parents never know what they will end up with. It might be the ideal scenario. It might be a scenario where the kid is disabled to the extent that they need lifelong care, or the kid becomes a drug addict and nothing the parents say or do ends up helping them, or they just become a really awful person. 

I'm not comfortable with all that risk, so I'm not going to do it. I wish that more people were given the tools to think about it critically and understand all of the risks so that fewer people would end up like OP and that fewer kids would end up unloved and unwanted."

confessions,fddlx3j,t3_eknk71,1578317228.0,"Your level of distress concerns me and if you don't think you can do it, you might want to look into placing the child for adoption. There's no shame in that. If this is too much for you, it's okay. Both you and your child deserve to be happy. If you don't think you will ever feel like this was worth it, and you can't imagine a lifetime of pretending that you wouldn't have it any other way, then I encourage you to look into this for the sake of your health and your son's health, too. It doesn't mean that you don't love him. In fact, if this is the best thing to do for everyone involved, then it is a decision that one would make out of love.

I'm autistic and my parents saw the signs when I was growing up, but they denied them and never got me help most likely because they wanted me to be normal. They also took out a lot of their insecurities on me. They really weren't happy with parenting me and some people realize that parenthood is not for them. I am not assuming that you would treat your kid like this, but you also shouldn't be forced into living this life if you don't want it. And if it depresses both of you, then the child might be better off in a different home. Like I said, this doesn't mean that you don't love him. It just means that you're doing what you can to make sure that he is being supported and you are not in a life that you maybe can't handle. I don't judge you if you can't. I wouldn't be able to handle that, either. Tbh, I worked with disabled children and decided that I probably wasn't going to have kids after that because I didn't think I could handle it if I had a disabled kid. If you really can't handle it or even afford it, adoption is an option. Hindsight is 20/20. Don't beat yourself up over this no matter what choice you make."

AncestryDNA,f7gfr0b,t3_dw3e1s,1573702597.0,"That's funny, I gained a small percentage of French out of EWNE. I have a grandmother that was mostly German, but that is all under EWNE. It feels inaccurate even though I know it's not."
AncestryDNA,f7ger49,t3_dw3deo,1573701829.0,"My grandparents on my dad's side are Irish American alone. 

My maternal grandmother was German with maybe a bit of English. She is descended from ethnic Germans that lived in Russia, so that little bit of Russian makes sense. 

My maternal grandfather was a mystery because his parents were adopted and orphaned. I was told that he was probably a mix of Irish, Welsh, and French or Cajun and I was told that there was some distant African American as well. The test lines up with most of that except I got indigenous American and not African American. 

My communities are mostly Irish except for my Southeastern Quebec French Settlers one."

raisedbynarcissists,f777kh1,t1_f6o0spj,1573446226.0,"I always think of that, too. I actually saw a missing kid case out of Spokane, WA a few days ago. The dad posted on Facebook about his missing son a week after he disappeared. He'd gone to a Seahawks game (hundreds of miles away) two days after the kid ran away and when I did a Google search on the kid's name (dad and son have the same name), I saw a news article from give years ago that described the father stealing an iPad from a disabled man. He's certainly Father of the Year, isn't he? 🙄"
