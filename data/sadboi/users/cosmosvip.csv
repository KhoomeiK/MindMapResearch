I would suggest investing in a prep course or book because it teaches you how to use shortcuts in math and what to look for in the reading comprehension.  Memorizing vocab words is important too. The GRE is all about working smarter not harder so you can answer all the questions in the allotted time. Take as many practice tests as you can so you can practice staying mentally engaged and focused for that long. There are a few free apps to practice vocab words, math problems, and reading comprehension.

Hope this helps! Message me if you want to chat more."

KillingEve,foctwq6,t3_g6ttaw,1587675816.0,"One if my favorites is when she's Billie at the AA meeting and has her monologue about being bored. She starts with ""Most of the time, most days, I feel nothing. I don't feel anything. It is so boring."" She then goes on about how nothing makes her feel emotion. As Villanelle, I don't know if she's actually telling the truth and showing us how she really feels or if she's just saying those things because Eve is listening, but it feels real and authentic. Jodie does such a good job tapping into emotion that it makes me empathize for Villanelle even though she's a psychopath and kills people all the time. I can never tell when Villanelle is mimicking emotion so she can manipulate someone, I always think that it's real and maybe she's not all bad, then she'll suddenly kill someone. Gets me every time, brilliant acting."
neuro,fo7yhee,t1_fo7xh86,1587586722.0,"I'm very curious what his plan is to target executive functioning. Different forms of therapy are available, but I think all are very beneficial and it's great your psychiatrist and therapist communicate.

On a separate note, you probably already know this, but be sure to communicate with your psychiatrist about any changes you may feel while tapering off."
neuro,fo7x0sg,t3_g664ou,1587586000.0,"Executive functioning refers to cognitive processes such as planning, problem solving, working memory, motivation, emotion regulation, inhibition and self-awareness. The prefrontal cortex, dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex, and the orbital frontal cortex are brain regions that are involved in executive functioning, however they also relay information to other brain regions such as the hippocampus, amygdala, thalamus, and insula.

The mechanism of action of SSRI/SNRIs is not completely understood, but they appear to block serotonin re-uptake, allowing for more serotonin to be available to bind to receptors. That being said, SSRI/SNRIs don't target specific brain regions, but rather act throughout the brain. But again, exactly how they work is not fully understood and is still being researched.

In regards to the cause of generalized anxiety and obsessive thoughts, that is also not fully understood, but may involved alterations in serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine levels. There may be other additional neurobiological factors as well. This is another area of active research.

As far as targeting ""executive functioning areas of the brain,"" that seems more like a psychotherapy approach, and working with a therapist to challenge maladaptive thoughts to restructure cognition in a more adaptive way. In this way, beneficial connections between brain regions are strengthened  while maladaptive connections are weakened.

I'm a neuroscientist not a psychiatrist, so I'm speaking from a scientific/research perspective, and not a trained in medicine perspective. However, it could be that your psychiatrist wants to taper you off your current medication if they have not been effective in order to assess your baseline functioning, and then plan from there.

I hope this is helpful, and I can try to answer any other questions you have!"

MaladaptiveDreaming,fn6x67f,t3_fzz8if,1586709089.0,"For me journaling about my daydreams helps them feel more like a written fictional story and less like something that's all in my head. I usually write out important scenes or moments for my characters. Journaling about daydreams is a different way to experience them because you can't close your eyes while writing or typing so you have to stay somewhat present while you write. I started a word doc and made a rough timeline then added scenes when I felt inspired, not necessarily in order. I would say set aside time to write about a part of your daydream and just let it flow out and don't worry if the writing isn't perfect. Hope this helps!"

MaladaptiveDreaming,fmx20l9,t3_fxwvg0,1586457051.0,"I can definitely relate to you. I spent most of my teenage years daydreaming about crushes and creating elaborate scenarios as if I was dating them. It was really complicated for me because I was confused about my sexual orientation at that time (which I've figured out now) so that made everything worse. About halfway through high school I gave up daydreaming about people at school and started daydreaming about being rich and famous and dating celebrities, which also had some downsides.

Now I have a few ongoing daydreams that I don't insert myself into. It really helped me to write down my daydreams so they felt more like a fictional story.  I feel more removed from my daydreams now and usually set aside time to work on them.

Just know you're not alone in this and things can improve but it might take time!"

Most of my daydreams have a love story component and I've started to be able to use a more loving and caring voice from my characters to improve negative self talk in myself.
