SuicideWatch,fr0vf27,t3_glzbn9,1589807655.0,"It’s not as simple as research or the method. Not that I’d ever even debate if a gun or stab to the heart is is better. Trying to kill oneself is always going to be worse than dying of natural causes, that’s for sure.

My main concern here is that you’re so impulsive and desperate to stop suffering. to the point where your main goal is to try anything, regardless of the consequences. You don’t care about consequences right? I bet you do because you already care that you’re suffering rn. So it’s fair to assume you care about suffering even more from failing, feeling excruciating pain and having health problems for the rest of your life bc of it.

Like I said, I want to kms, so I get it. I really do. To the point where If anyone ever saves me I will sue them for everything they have, and I’ll take it further, if I’m resuscitated. The only reason I’m still alive is because I haven’t figured out the best plan with the highest possible chance. It’s not just the method. Like I said, could be saved by someone. There are many factors to take into account.

One gun. Even two guns. Seems like a chance right? Not high enough. But at least it’s a chance right? But what if you miss? Since people can survive gun shots to the head. You might think, well not often and I’m willing to take the risk. It happens often enough. And even if it had only ever happened once, what if you’re unlucky enough to be the second time.

One time I wasn’t even trying to kill myself, but I ended up choking and suffocating. I wanted nothing more than to lay down and accept death, that’s what I had wanted for so long. To this day I still want that. But the reality was I was naked and I didn’t want to be seen/found naked, it wouldn’t have mattered when I was dead, but I was still alive and couldn’t get over such embarrassment. I  was suffocating and flailing about  so I didn’t have the coordination, time or energy to just put on clothes then die. So I had to induce vomiting instead. Here am. Still alive and suffering. But I still know that wasn’t the best method in conjunction with other factors to die. 

The reality is failure and complications are very common and rn you’re too desperate to make the least complicated choices available. I am really just so worried that you’ll end up suffering more. But it’s up to you what you do with your life. I hope you take the opportunities to make it better when they arise"

You’re missing crucial factors and are trying to convince me of incorrect information. Which isn’t the problem bc I know what’s correct or not, the problem is that you’ve convinced yourself your plans are easy, and have clearly relayed incorrect information, which shows that the chances of complications and failure are even higher. You can relay any info and try to correct me again if you want, but at the end of the day idc who’s right or wrong, I care about you not trying to stab yourself. If you end up attempting it, “I told you so” isn’t going to matter to either of us when your body is messed up. For the sake of your own safety at least do better research"

SuicideWatch,fr0otuk,t3_glzbn9,1589802744.0,"Thankfully there are people here being supportive. I would like to focus on what you posted about, as in life people do whatever they want where possible, I don’t know what’s going through your mind. I can’t just ignore than you’ve even looked into this. I myself want to kms but I’m not going to pretend that killing oneself is a good act in the first place, bc it’s not. And unfortunately that’s one of the most painful and unreliable suicide (attempt) methods. So I’ll just completely recommend against stabbing yourself. It’s not as simple nor as painless (it seems you expect only a few seconds of pain) as it may sound. Have you ever accidentally / innocently slipped your fork or even a pen and hit your finger? The natural reaction is to instantly pull away and it hurts. People who are avid self harmers barely ever go further than to cut more than a small incision on only skin. Your heart is also protected by your ribcage and surrounded by other organs. A lot of people think their heart is located on the right or left side, but the heart isn’t simply on the right of left side. Most people especially don’t know the exact location of their own heart. Of course I hate the idea of you getting hurt from anything, including the mental pain you’re already experiencing. But I’d especially be concerned about conflicting such a violent act upon yourself, the complications that would likely arise and then having to survive with those new problems. It sounds like this might be quite an impulsive decision too. I hope that whatever you’re going through, you’re able to take some time out to feel more calm, and get some peace of mind"

depression_memes,fqqheo2,t1_fqqc764,1589565558.0,"... Did you just admit to drinking underage 👀

 Ive tried a wide range of drinks. I expected someone (not underage) would probably mention liking the taste. You’re referring to the taste right? To which I came to the conclusions years ago is bs. I don’t see how alcohol can taste good let alone amazing. Always seems to me like ppl lying to themselves and overcompensating with the whole alcohol tastes good thing. I’m interested to know how people come to that conclusion"

Alcoholics make it look so easy

I tried very hard. But it doesn’t taste good and it burns"
depression_memes,fqpe10j,t1_fqmwsmv,1589543871.0,"Totally relate to that as well. As nice as it sounds in theory to be happy, love and be loved, the reality is much more complicated. And although there are ambitions catching cobwebs in my mind, not even those are enough. Even while I’m still here bc we don’t have that much control over our own lives. I prefer to mind my own business but many people and things don’t. No point in dragging anyone down with me lmao"

Obsession is the only level of crazy I can’t handle. No one likes a stalker.

You like Bexey, we get it.

His music and presence _makes you feel better,_ _I get it, honestly I do._

_Like I said,_ there’s a lot to like about him.

He has a great community overall.

_I can empathize_ or kinda get what people mean _but there’s a fine line_.

People are getting mixed up. They need to _distance themselves and come back to reality. This isn’t healthy._

I don’t know if you read any of the other comments but there’s solid proof to come up with this perceptive"
