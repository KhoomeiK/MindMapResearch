It doesn't matter if the event did not put your life at risk, as it would if you lost a leg or suffering a gunshot during a battle. That does not change the brain's response to a fearful and terrifying event. Someone else's opinion on whether said event was ""traumatic enough"" does not alter the victim's central nervous system response, nor does it remedy the pain they feel in their lives afterwards.

 Several of the thoughts I laid bare on this post were the result of an LSD trip I had, which made me feel utterly hopeless by the end of it. LSD felt extremely high-tech, sharp, and in-tune with all of the things I am dissatisfied with in modern life. Whenever I took shrooms, I felt very at peace, and there was a sense of love around me as well as an afterglow that I experienced as a result of being close to flora and fauna and embracing the natural world, if that makes sense. 

However, the LSD trip I took around a month after I had experimented with psylocibin only reinforced all the pain I saw in the world. I had revelations about the suffering I had experienced as a child, and how no one cared.

I am not suggesting that depression is a matter of someone's willpower or lack thereof, medications are a potential aid in helping someone. However, having struggled with this condition for the majority of my life, and having been on over a dozen psychiatric medications, I can safely say that they aren't very beneficial if your depression is caused by trauma or poverty rather than a Serotonin imbalance. Those issues are hard to medicalize. Also antipsychotics are often dished out in these wards as opposed to milder drugs. This can have very dangerous longterm effects. 

For a sexual assault victim or someone who suffered an abusive experience where their autonomy and free will was taken away from them, these hospitals can cause those memories to resurface tenfold.

All in all, I feel like I am more suited for the expat life. I feel way more accepted here than I did in America. Like I said, the only thing I miss is the food."

depression,fnc87jc,t3_g0s1ms,1586830721.0,"It's honestly a toss up of whether or not they will work, everyone should make their own decisions regarding psychiatric medications, because not all humans respond the same. You have to make your own cost-benefit analysis.

Some people get lucky and find relief, some people like me take over a dozen meds and never get any positive effects. Being shoved pills I knew nothing about as a teenager and getting tremors- because I was unaware of the consequences of serotonin syndrome- was not a great experience. 

I think it's important to be aware of the risks of these medications, particularly the withdrawals, and the chance that your symptoms will worsen.

 The advice I see online is a bit disingenuous, as I always see people trying to encourage others to take psychiatric medications without educating themselves on the side effects or even the mechanisms of the drug. 

Whenever I became an adult and gained more autonomy in conversing with the psychiatrist, I researched every drug thoroughly that I was prescribed. There was a time when a Psychiatrist prescribed me drugs with glaring interactions, a beta blocker and a stimulant, and I would not have known this prior if I hadn't made the decision to become more informed about pharmacology. 

Knowledge is power, and it is helpful to get an idea of what you might experience with a drug, there are lots of reviews online and research papers that document side effects, what to expect, etc.

Also if you have trauma, antidepressants will not really help you, at least in my experience and the case studies I've read in PTSD literature. Same with bipolar, except these drugs could make your symptoms worse. 

Not saying to never take anti-depressants, that should be up to the will of the individual and whether or not they benefit you. I just wish someone had sat down and told me that I could have side effects from the medications before I went down the rabbit hole of trying all of them lol."

unpopularopinion,fn3ladw,t3_fz5k0d,1586623015.0,"Death is an enigma for most people, if someone dies of natural causes, you wouldn't call them selfish. 

However if someone has agency and makes the decision to take their own life- even in regards to death with dignity cases where someone who is permanently disabled or terminally ill petitions for assisted suicide, that is seen as a selfish act.

Someone's death is going to cause grief and anguish no matter the circumstance.  It seems more selfless to me to let someone make their own decisions on their mortality, as opposed towards keeping them alive by force.

One of my parents tried to attempt suicide in front of me in elementary school. They died several weeks later by putting themselves in a risky situation. Do I blame them? No. I am glad that they are at peace now rather than suffering every single day, and I know that due to intergenerational conflict, addiction, lack of money, and other life circumstances, there was no ""hope"" left for them.

It wasn't selfish."

 Everyone should be able to take prophylactic measures to keep themselves safe, and it's a pity that many at-risk populations including workers in the manufacturing, grocery, delivery, etc industries will be denied adequate protection because of this masks don't work propaganda."
Antipsychiatry,fmwfkvb,t3_fxhh9f,1586445690.0,"While I don't think all mental illnesses are politicised and lack foundation, in my experience with PTSD, you are treated like your reactions to a traumatic event are a personal failure rather than an expected rewiring of the brain. 

It is political in a way, because there is a tendency for people to place blame on the victim- if you hadn't worn that outfit, maybe this wouldn't have happened, if you hadn't signed up for the military you wouldn't be traumatised, etc, etc. If you state that you have PTSD, as it is often listed as a disability, you will be disadvantaged for many jobs and opportunities. Once you have that label, you've been stigmatised. Even if it is your brain's intrinsic response to be more vigilant and fearful following a severe shock, you are treated like you've done something immoral. That is wrong, and shows how ignorant the majority of the world is in regards to trauma.

Van Der Kolk's the Body Keeps The Score talks a lot about Psychiatry in the 60's and 70's, and how his textbooks at Harvard med described abuse of young girls as an extremely rare occurrence that could even be BENEFICIAL to them. He began to wonder the legitimacy of this, when he was getting multiple girls a week coming into his office who had suffered trauma- it wasn't a one in a million chance like he'd read in the textbooks."

depression,fmmff58,t3_fw4bha,1586204283.0,"Saying that depression is just a chemical imbalance is truly an oversimplification of the issue, I agree.

I have depression, but I also have PTSD. PTSD can alter the volume of the hippocampus, increase the function of the amygdala, the region of the brain that activates fear and the fight or flight response, and decreased functioning in the anterior cingulate which controls many complex tasks like decision making and empathy. 

Increased release of Norepinephrine is only part of the issue. I suspect many people who are diagnosed with depression have underlying trauma and difficult life circumstances that would reasonably cause us to be miserable. But if you look at other illnesses like PTSD, it makes no sense that long-term depression is simply a chemical imbalance of serotonin, however there is still so much we do not know."

aspergers,fmfrgi3,t1_fmfp6v8,1586033306.0,"I agree food and exercise are important, like you said.  I think more of my point was that there are very Aspie specific issues that can't really be pegged under the same label as what a NT person might experience, I am studying Neuroscience so I find all of it fascinating as well. 

Depression may manifest similar symptoms, but for a NT person it may not be as much of a struggle to pick up running or whatnot, while for an autistic person being seen in the public eye may be terrifying.

 I used to walk for miles everyday but people told me that wasn't 'enough' despite being sore everyday from it, just thinking about running makes my legs ache horribly lol. I really wish that I could reap the benefits of exercise but I have never gotten any rush during or after, or felt that I was becoming 'fit', it was always just a chore. I am probably one of the few people who exercised for months and months and found that it didn't decrease any of my anxiety from PTSD or physical symptoms, nor did it make me feel better mentally, but most people it seems to help. 

  I only recently sort of learned to ride a bike, I have pretty bad motor issues as a result of autism,  and have never been able to successfully play a sport or anything of that nature without being bullied to the point where I would quit. While bad motor skills aren't solely an autistic thing, I don't think a lot of NT people realise it's a lot more difficult for someone with autism to go to a loud, crowded gym full of bodies and social interaction. I think that's the nuance I wanted to hit there is that there are some things that do make us different. 

It doesn't mean NT's are more well equipped to deal with everything, but there are some things that we do need extra help with or things that may not bother a NT person with depression but do bother an Autistic person and vice versa."

I have not found a solution myself, except I also use marijuana for severe flashbacks. My old psychiatrist even admitted that I should have been a prime candidate for medical marijuana due to PTSD, but there are only certain people who can prescribe it, and they charge a hefty fee. As long as you don't become addicted, it can be helpful when you don't have an off switch for severe triggers.

Futurology,fmb3ryn,t1_fmap538,1585917528.0,"I just want to say that higher education debt and healthcare highly depends on what area of the United States you are in. While it is true that some universities cost less than others, or some hospitals have lower wait times, in some states the situation is quite dire. A majority  of people on Reddit that I come across are from California, New England, or one of the better Midwestern states.

New York and California compose the majority of the American economy, and have a vast network of resources that many states do not have. California has lowered the cost of community college, and has guaranteed acceptance programs in place for 2-year college students so that they can attend a 4-year school with little debt.

While we have community colleges in other states, the quality of education and the price does not compare to places like California that prioritise education. It is difficult for students in states that have a poor secondary education system to attend college, and they may incur more debt if it takes them longer due to poor foundation or failing classes.

At least in my state, I've never met anyone who hasn't complained of an extremely long ER wait time, the averages at the nearby hospital were hours unless you were having a heart attack or came in the dead of night. Even with insurance, many people still have debt, and it's a fight to get insurance to cover anything. A for-profit healthcare system has crippled a lot of Americans.

Lots of us in these less prosperous states are not getting the quality of life that other Americans have.
