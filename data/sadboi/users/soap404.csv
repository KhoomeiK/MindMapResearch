I’m really sorry to hear about that man, I hope you find respite and maybe the confidence (or lack of care like I’m my case) to share your work

you’re right in that I don’t really want to die I guess, but I lost a lot of things and most importantly people. I’m not religious whatsoever, but I’ve grown so indifferent about living or dying, that I wouldn’t mind joining them, wherever they went. 
I want change, I have ideas and dreams and I’m kind of excited for the crazy future, if we don’t manage to annihilate us somehow in the meantime, which well.. we’ll see about that.
but I’m stuck where I am, I’ve been poor my entire life, and good luck climbing the ladder in Germany, I’ve tried to get into university for something called visual communication and got rejected twice, even had a friend with me one day who no offense was clearly less skilled creatively, I mean he even acknowledged it, of course he got admitted to study.
I’m gonna try next year with product design, if that doesn’t work out I might as well join the army or some shit.
It’s like no matter how fucking hard I’m trying to achieve anything with what I’ve learned, I’m bound to lose, and it’s been like that most of life. that fucking tears me apart, I never felt entitled to anything, how could I? I see people around me succeeding all the time, I just want a sliver. Is life really just suffering? 
And yeah I meditate a lot, that’s why I’m out of hope, if that makes sense."
TrueOffMyChest,f8182x7,t1_f8173pt,1574154936.0,"sorry to hear that man, I hope you find something new soon

I tried man, I’ve been an artist for over ten years now, I tried every media, wrote songs, produced beats, painted landscapes, portraits, djing and sculpting, drawing, you name it.
It’s what kept me going in the past, but I don’t even have the energy and motivation anymore, it’s not like my creativity is gone I believe but I just can’t anymore.
I have very few friends, and I’m afraid they’re just there because of pity.
the love of my life died 8 years ago, when I was still pretty young and let’s say I haven’t been successful with the ladies since.
so I guess I’m kind of talented (although no one gives a fuck about it) and I’m not homeless (yet)  but otherwise i struggle to see any good or worth in my life, excuse my english btw I’m not a native"

I’m also not too big on being philanthropic with a bunch of animals that treated me like dirt my entire life.
sadly I’m also sick af and can’t really go outside, it’s almost freezing anyway"

Secondly, I’m a Gunsmith. 
Let me tell you just how lucky you’ve been man.

""Based on this test, statistics will tell you that our primers are 99.9997 percent reliable. That means that when struck with sufficient energy and properly centered, they will go off 99.9997 percent of the time.“ 
[Winchester Ammo]

The chances of that bullet not going off were about 3 thousands of a percent.

I’ve been doing this since 2011, never once in my practice in tens of thousands of rounds have I encountered a primer failure.

I really hope things clear up for you, I’m not religious tbh, but you should thank your god for that."
