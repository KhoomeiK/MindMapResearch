suggestmeabook,f57xnh1,t1_f57vqz3,1572044960.0,"I think what really impressed me about the film was that they completely nailed the tone. Everything was how I pictured it (down to the colors). The dance scene actually annoyed me too. I suppose they did it to build more tension between Kathy H and Ruth but I thought it was a wonderful moment of characterization for Madame. It drove home the point that she genuinely felt for these kids and had to keep her distance because, outside the school, she was so emotionally invested in proving they were just as valuable as the ppl they were copied from. It really is a book that inspires...introspection I guess. I remember after reading it the first time feeling like I wanted to be alone with my thoughts for a while. Those are the best kind of books.

depression,f3dn3r7,t1_f3dgq3j,1570841362.0,"Badly lol. It's hard af I won't lie to u. It was AWFUL when I first got clean but it gets slightly easier with time. U have to create literal and metaphorical distance between u and whatever toxic elements u are trying to leave behind. Ready for an essay? It went something like this. The first step was I got out of a relationship with someone who had no intention of getting clean and had sabotaged alley previous attempts at kicking. I literally left my house, my car, everything I left with could fit into a Kroger bag. I moved to a new town, got a new number, deleted all my contacts (that part's important), met new ppl, and started over. The idea was, and still is, that even tho there are plenty of times I still want to get high I've made it fairly impossible to even know where to start looking for dope. U think my friends are gonna allow me to sink back to that place. Hell no. These aren't my dope ""friends"" these ppl actually care. Leaving all those ppl behind is actually pretty easy because their priorities are no longer their friends and family. They're still fixated on one thing now and, when u no longer have that in common, y'all have very little to hold that friendship together. I had to force myself to start over with nothing and that gave me something to focus on initially. Nowadays it's a battle. Mostly when I'm bored or sad. But, like I said, going CT was the best way because it's something I never wanna go thru again. I truly believe it's beneficial to go thru that process. Builds character lol. Now...I have a lot of emotional baggage and go thru very deep depressions but, in a way, it's sometimes nice to be able to say ""fuck, man, it could be worse. I could be dopesick rn."" I think back on all the fucked up situations, all the money, all the hours I wasted. I think about how I used to be sick as hell and then when I finally got high and wasn't sick anymore, which is supposed to be a good thing, I would just cry. Because I knew I had to figure out how to get high the next time. And that was all I did all day every day. Rinse and repeat. So how do I handle cravings? I white knuckle my way thru and tell myself ""at least you're not THAT anymore."" And just ride it out. Dude I am so so sorry I dunno where all those words came from.
So tell me. What would u have to change to be ok?
