I had been overweight all my life, over a few months lost any excess fat, and ended up looking much different.

Looking at the pictures now it's hard to believe how thin I was. My self perception eventually caught up but there was definitely a mismatch for a while. 

Anyway your transformation is amazing and you should be proud!"
