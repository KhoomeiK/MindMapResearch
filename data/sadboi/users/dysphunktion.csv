Let me fix that for you, you know, for accuracy...

""Dude this isn't even the point. :| point is: My centers ""sanitization"" is a joke. It's not just my hub, it's everywhere, because I've been to everywhere! And each time I was at a new center, I was there just in time to catch first responders slackin'.""

Is that better? Looks better.I get why everyone is saying that you should just do X. It makes much more sense to fix a problem when it's presented itself. But from day one you union folk (well, admittedly us mean ol sups too) and trained about ""OMFG DON'T TOUCH IT GET A SUP. LEAVE AREA. GET A SUP LEAVING THE AREA!"" And it is a good policy. For those 2 times a year you actually need to utilize your training with a spill or some such. But the vast majority of the time it is situations like this. Where common sense will fix things right up. A little Dawn dish soap spilled? Get a responder! Everyone! Stop the belt! An unknown substance! Not food! Might be...something! Is that you? You seem like that.

Are you standing on principal? You refuse to throw on some gloves and take care of this. Why? Why specifically? I've seen you say the usual ""not my job"" to ""ill get the troubles!"" but it's none of those, is it? You're just trying to make some kind of point. You want the world to know that not only are you a hard worker, you're one of the hardest! You could pick that up and discard it so hardcore they'll whisper your deeds throughout the ages! But I won't do it! I'll show UPS! And those damn sups! I won't even tell anyone IRL either! I'll show them! But wait, what is this? You told your supervisor? And it's STILL there? Lazy sups! It's not like they have 50 drivers to worry about. Nah. They didn't just get through hearing about Toms husbands suicide. Or Marissa having a miscarriage on route. You didn't lose your aunt who was a second mother, a year later your father, 5 months later your last aunt, now your mother is going. Nah. My problem, my BLOOD problem, needs to be dealt with. I'm union.

Man, posts like this remind me of how much I love my drivers and PDSs.

Nor have I wrote so much, backspaced, wrote it again, backspace.....  


  
I initially wanted to say something negative about the OP and her approach to all of this. I have my own thoughts on racism that don't usually align with the majority. (No, I'm not) So I was more taken back when, on my 129th attempt at this, I realized I was having such a hard time because I didn't really agree with what I was even saying. Well, partly. Yeah, I was annoyed at mom for taking such a bleak approach to this. Even thought she might be making this poor kids life worse by making this into some huge issue. (Here is where I kind of still agree with myself) And...well, it doesn't even matter. While sure, I disagree with (what I'm assuming happened) her approach to this, it's not even really her I have the problem with.  
It's the why...  


I've experienced discrimination, even racism. I'm a walking contradiction. Spikey hair, blonde and at the time, covered in tattoos (facial tattoos too, have before/after pics...before you call BS) and piercings, glasses. I was also a huge science and even more so, PC nerd. I also loved fighting. Growing up as a minority (in my town), I was spit on, beat up, shot at, etc. And as shitty as all that was, I know that this kid more than likely has experienced similar, if not worse, in his short time here. I grew up, tamed my hair, removed the metal in my face and spent a lot of time under zee lazer! (har har?) so I could look more...normal. This kid can't do that. This kid is black. And that I even had to think that other black people have wished they weren't? Sigh.  


I should probably backspace this one too. It's a rambling, hard to follow mess. But hopefully, if you read this far, got the jist of it.   


So I'm not mad that OP did/said everything in her post. I'm pissed that she even had to.

So, your package was misdelivered, it happens more than it should. But we are pretty good at making situations like this right by the customer. After you called on Monday, you haven't heard -anything- since? Do you remember what time you called? Depending on the time, it's POSSIBLE (unlikely) that you called soon enough to generate the event and get a driver followup in the same day. That is rather rare, however. More than likely it was generated and linked to the center that the driver who misdel'ed it works out of. Then, someone at that center (should be management) will (SHOULD!) login to that system and see your issue, print out the followup paper and talk to the driver. Driver then attempts to recover it, if he had no contact, he may leave a note and never go back or go back the next day and try again.  


The most important thing here is speed. Situations like this have to be addressed as quick as possible to limit the amount of time the receiver has to start thinking ""Not my fault!"", ""My name kinda sounds like ""your name"". ""I hate the color brown!"" etc etc. Whatever makes it easier for them to justify keeping it.

UPS,f9ntaql,t3_e64uyt,1575490321.0,"Did you order it in your name? Most of the time the driver doesn't actually check your ID. He'll hand you the DIAD to sign, maybe ask your name and off you go! You should be just fine, no worries! And congrats!"
UPS,f9nt63a,t3_e64xaq,1575490264.0,"There were quite a few late planes across the country this morning, so it's quite possible there is an actual delay. But it's hard to believe that there is a trailer sitting somewhere full of pkgs and not moving. Of course, it could be sitting in the east area of the country where they are having some serious snow."
UPS,f9nsn02,t1_f9nq2vh,1575490006.0,"Will look into soon. Does the area it shows in the UPS website, does that area have any weather issues?"
UPS,f9nsj3f,t1_f9nq084,1575489951.0,"Ugh, PVDs. One or two winners and the rest blowing up my phone every 11 seconds. ""Press big up."" I've said that soooo many times."
UPS,f9nlj79,t3_e60cd2,1575486597.0,"I've seen entirely too many of these this week. Upon digging into various tracking numbers and then checking weather in those areas, it's BS. And I had to literally call up those centers and tell them to put the damn pkgs on a truck and get them out. Putting emergency conditions on a pkg when there is no such condition is a HUGE no. Like lose your job no. Sigh."
UPS,f9nlaa1,t3_e611tv,1575486482.0,"I agree with /u/sybil_mazzi  
Ready for shipment is usual the first thing that happens with a shipment. It should next have gotten a pickup scan (when we picked it up from shipper or they brought it to us) and then it starts moving to you."
UPS,f9njidf,t3_e639i8,1575485611.0,"No, never, wth? The driver is supposed to recover it, not you!  
Grrr. Who told you this?"
UPS,f9lhj2v,t1_f9lhax9,1575423240.0,"In transit is not the same as out for delivery. In transit means that the package is moving around, maybe between hubs, on a plane/truck en route to the center that will get it on a package car and to your door.
If the package was sorted/loaded to a vehicle today it would more than likely reflect that in the tracking information. So it looks like it is more than likely not coming until tomorrow.
It -could- still show up, but it's unlikely. :\"
UPS,f9lha9c,t3_e5rhrl,1575423070.0,"Does it say in transit or out for delivery?? Also, it's now *PEAK* season so it's not uncommon to have a driver show up as late as 11PM."
UPS,f9lh8ff,t3_e5oevu,1575423036.0,"I don't like this...at all. Emergency Conditioning a package if it's not a scenario that is legit is a ***HUGE*** no no.  
Like, I have my drivers take a picture of the road and send it to me before I OK it. So I'm really hoping you and everyone else here that has the same issue are seeing it in a legitimate form...ug.  


Like I offer to most people now, lol, feel free to PM me tracking numbers and when I head to the office in the AM (about 10 hours from now) I can dig a bit deeper and see *the truth*, so to speak, lol."
UPS,f9lgsoo,t1_f9lgiwr,1575422731.0,"It can lag. That could be what happened in this situation. I'm sure he believes that you paid but it would be his ass if he released the pkg to you with his DIAD screaming at him. I don't even think it would allow him to scan/release it in situations like this.

Smart move just having it held to be picked up. What an odd situation, lol."
UPS,f9lg0vi,t3_e5ra7m,1575422192.0,"Hmm. He cannot give you the package because ""*he does see on his terminal that I paid.*"" ? I don't understand that. Or was he saying he shows that you *didn't* pay? He gave you no other information?? Did he tell you exactly what his DIAD (terminal) said??  


If you PM me the tracking number I can look into it when I go in in the AM, in 11 hours."
UPS,f9l7187,t3_e5owmt,1575415958.0,"It wasn't a driver. It never made it to a package car. Appears to be at a hub. We DO NOT (shouldn't,  anyway) do emergency conditions unless we really can't move the pkg. It's a huge issue this year."
UPS,f9l6nj5,t3_e5o9cr,1575415705.0,"Call 1800pickups ASAP! This needs to be addressed immediately. Based on what you said, it's more than likely on the shipper since it doesn't sound like a failure on our end. You didn't mention any tampering....

Call them both now."
UPS,f9kurpy,t1_f9ktllv,1575408281.0,"Sure, throw me a quick PM. I'll be heading to the office in about 30 minutes to grab a paper and can check on yours."
UPS,f9klynk,t3_e5bvb0,1575403184.0,This is why I am so glad I started hiring PVD's and helpers a month in advance. Last year we hired our seasonal help right at the start of peak and half the time they weren't all that helpful due to being so new. Now my PVD's are tearing it up.
UPS,f9kiog9,t3_e5ecc1,1575401256.0,"Gift cards are always the smart choice in these situations.  
Glad you found a center with decent management. Not many of us around these days."
UPS,f9kijmb,t3_e5afxs,1575401180.0,"Customers like you are awesome. I get the occasional call about one of my drivers and it's always awesome.  
After you talk to someone about this driver, let him know and then let *me* know (maybe in a week?) if he ever got any official recognition. There are some small ways we can officially acknowledge awesome drivers like yours!"
UPS,f9kicq7,t3_e5i9fy,1575401068.0,"I have to agree with /u/GodDamnYouDee here. Call the number and start an investigation ASAP. If it was misdelivered, there may be time to recover it."
UPS,f9ki9mx,t3_e5kad1,1575401017.0,"The shipper will more than likely either replace or reimburse you. Unless we are proven at fault, we don't typically pay the customer. If you want, throw me a tracking number for that pkg and or a case number and I can look into it for ya."
UPS,f9ki1ox,t3_e5ial9,1575400885.0,"Even as a manager, I have to agree with the driver. I didn't read the article but I can already bet why he refused.  
Without that logging data, they can say whatever they want and he has no real way to refute it. I hate that that is even something we would do, but alas...  


I'll park package cars that faulty ELD's, cameras, etc. Same with the DIADS."
UPS,f9ik97j,t1_f9ijwxc,1575339186.0,"Ah, yeah, a lot of centers do that.  
I don't have an excuse or explanation for your situation unfortunately. These things *do* happen, sadly. But compared to the volume we deliver daily, it's not *too* bad. I hope you manage to get this situation worked out."
UPS,f9ik2ca,t1_f9ijvpk,1575339054.0,You got this. Just be patient with the driver and handle it as the situation allows.
UPS,f9ijz7l,t3_e59s53,1575338991.0,"You should be getting the 14/hr once you start working. I want to say that it's training pay but I can't be sure as I haven't had to deal with timecard/pay stuff in awhile. It wouldn't hurt to ask just to be clear.  
As for your checks, how long ago did you input your DD information? Did you get a paper check first? If so, this coming Friday it should appear in your bank. You can check your check as early as late Wednesday/early Thursday morning."
UPS,f9ijg3m,t1_f9ij0yz,1575338620.0,It's what it is. The helpers are life savers for my drivers and help us tremendously during this shit show. Hopefully you manage to find a driver that works out better for ya.
UPS,f9ij918,t1_f9ieke4,1575338482.0,"Hey, I resemble that remark!  
:P"
UPS,f9ij5u8,t3_e59mfx,1575338422.0,"As far as I know, this sub isn't monitored by customer service, just a heads up.  


I'm not sure why you were told the driver forgot your package. Unless it's a small, driver sort and load center, that doesn't happen. The driver doesn't even load his own truck.  
I would try to call the actual center instead of the 800 number. As upset as you are, if you do call, try not to come off like an asshole. (Not saying you are/will) It's peak now and for the majority of centers, we're experiencing higher than predicted volume. I'm not using that as an excuse for your situation, just letting you know so that you understand the stress drivers and management are under and ...yeah, I'm sure you get what I'm saying.  


If you'd like, throw me a PM with the tracking number and I can look into it in the AM and let you know if they were being honest with all of these odd updates."
UPS,f9iig3k,t1_f9ii0t1,1575337927.0,"I like the attitude about going to management. I didn't think you would humor the idea of talking to the driver. By all means, give it a shot! Hopefully the situation works out for you.
I should add, in case you do go to management with this, just be aware that they may side with the driver just because you're ""the help"". I don't know if that is how your sups will see it but just wanted to give you a worst case scenario heads up."
UPS,f9igy3k,t1_f9ign3h,1575336882.0,"I'd speak with the supervisor and see if you can switch. Granted, you may not be able to stick with the same driver throughout peak, but hopefully you end up with a driver that does more to help."
UPS,f9igs1t,t1_f9iftdu,1575336764.0,"Sigh.
What I said makes perfect sense, as it's exactly what happens, as it was described. The driver will drop a helper off at a central location, of which I gave examples of. The driver then moves a few stops down or to another complex and swings back to pickup the helper.

You are complaining about having to do the work you were hired to do. It's really that simple. Sure, it sounds like you got stuck with a shit driver, so ask to be placed with a different driver/swap drivers with another helper, etc. We don't want you upset while you're out there, really. I do everything I can to make sure my drivers/pvds and helpers are all happy with their day. Hopefully you can find a supervisor that is willing to work with you.

As for your follow up post, what? I fired a helper for refusing to do the job he was hired to do. And he had it much, much more easier than what you described. I did my share of driving. Now I run multiple centers and have the highest employee retention in the district."
UPS,f9ifi0j,t1_f9ifadt,1575335865.0,Awesome! Sounds like it was a Surepost package. Glad it worked out!
