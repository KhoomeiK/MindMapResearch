And don’t worry about causing scene I learned that people forget quickly they are more occupied by them selves they prolly just gonna gossip about you which is pathetic.

And about maths degree I totally feel you I’ve been attending a course which I have no passion towards but I don’t want change it cause my “future plans” keep changing every week."
BPD,fdqj3kg,t3_emk7lx,1578667916.0,"1)Ewww and 2) Ewww

Sounds like type guy who values his friends more than a girlfriend (wouldn’t be surprised if his friends convinced him that you are “that crazy bitch)

The most annoying part is he prolly expects you to comfort him when he has hard times.

Part of me wishes you would drop his ass in badass way.

Anyways there is so much wonderful guys around who will accept the fact that ya have BPD, I promise!"
BPD,fcvb0ql,t3_ej3m8h,1577998343.0,Thank you for your response! I really wanna make meditation into routine I hope I will stick to it.
BPD,fcs1b0c,t1_fcs0982,1577909878.0,It sucks that I can’t really do anything to help you but I full heartedly wish that you will stay strong and receive the best help you possibly can because you deserve to get better and live up your fullest potential!
BPD,fcrv5p5,t3_eimb2s,1577907043.0,"This sounds so bad I totally relate.I always thought that people can see through my social anxiety but actually everyone around me thinks I’m cold and arrogant

I just hate that people think that mental illness is always severe and very visible when in reality most people learn to hide it"
BPD,fch2qc4,t1_fch2ee2,1577646747.0,If you don’t mind sharing could you describe it how it is for you?

BPD,fb8ugwl,t1_fb8te4z,1576622161.0,"I know I really need to but I always stop myself from seeing therapist because I tell myself stuff like “well you didn’t try to kill yourself so it’s not that bad or you ain’t shut in”

Plus I have one friend who has severe mental issues and I always compare myself to her and end up minimising my issues

I dunno it’s just seems so hard to ask for help (I literally have no idea what would I say) when sometimes I can’t even ask a stranger for a pen"
BPD,fb8rzpl,t1_fb8qx0i,1576620552.0,A bit random but I’m from UK too I thought if I say P.E no one will get it but anyways just wanted to say hi to a fellow Brit and I’m glad that you survived through school too and are in better place now
BPD,fb8pkya,t3_ebw9g0,1576618980.0,"Oh hell yeah school was well traumatising 

Severe social anxiety made me dependent on people who were very toxic 

The bullying was so mild that I would always convince myself that I’m just dramatic and a crybaby 

I would ditch sports just because I had strong anxiety about being the “gay kid” in a changing room and when I told the teacher he said I have to toughen up (but than they would preach about mental health which seemed so fake)

I ditched this toxic friend after being friends for 2 years and she got so mad about it that she gathered some assholes to beat me up so I became friends with her again so I would feel some sense of security and stopped being friends with some nice people because of her (I know I’m such dumbass I still hate myself for it)

Literally on my last day I was pushed by some crackhead in front all my classmates and most of em laughed I’m really surprised that I managed to “survive” the whole high school 

Now I’m in college and environment here is much better so I’m glad I got kinda “happy ending” I guess"
aspd,fao8kvg,t1_fanx0nq,1576259365.0,"I could relate to a lots of points but usually my motivation is what would the public  think if I won’t act caring enough.I’m not diagnosed with aspd and I highly doubt I have it because I care about my mom and some of my friends.I guess the reason why I’m telling  you all this information is because I wonder what motivates you to put all this work on acting like you care about other people?

Do you gain anything from it or you just feel like you have to do it?

Also side question.Can person with aspd struggle with self esteem issues because in media they are usually betrayed as confident badasses and I wonder how true that is to your experience?"
aspd,fanswws,t1_fanr9k0,1576249826.0,"I also have other questions I wanted to ask if you don’t mind

1.How do people usually react when they find out that you have aspd?

2.How do you experience love/attraction? 

3.Would you care if one of your family members died?

4.Do you experience anxiety? 

5.What the worst part of having aspd?

6.When and how did you realise that you might have aspd?

7.If you could get away with a murder would you do it?"
