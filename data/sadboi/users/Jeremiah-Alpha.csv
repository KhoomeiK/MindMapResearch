 BTW if your anti-vaxx, just at least don't send your kid to school, for their safety, and ours.

(I'm lucky my mom vaccinated me, I'd rather be bad at social situations than die before my fifth birthday anytime.

If I could get rid of my autism, I wouldn't get rid of it, because it makes me who I am, and it makes me intelligent, I don't know how to be social, but I can tell you the name of any country you point at in Eurasia, plus I know some Russian and little German.
