AskReddit,fqdq0o1,t1_fqciws2,1589294566.0,"It‚Äôs normal to be a little to mildly sore after your first few adjustments. And much more sore if you have a spine injury that‚Äôs being treated with the adjustment. But over time, just like exercise, you won‚Äôt be in pain. During the adjustment it can be a bit uncomfortable for a brief moment but it doesn‚Äôt last longer than a few seconds. It is literally pulling your bones back into a different alignment so of course you‚Äôre going to feel it. It also depends how far out of alignment you were. Bigger corrections are more painful."
AskReddit,fqdpqgu,t1_fqd1c28,1589294419.0,"Mhh it‚Äôs not a yes or no answer. I would say it‚Äôs not for everyone but many people can and do benefit. I would say it‚Äôs just that it‚Äôs temporary relief. Unless you receive many adjustments over time. (12-48 adjustments) and that it requires physical therapy in addition to keep the adjustments in place. If you just go get an adjustment once a month or twice a year, you won‚Äôt really get too much out of it besides feeling good for a few hours. And they aren‚Äôt necessary for everyone. Like I can get adjusted for free but I don‚Äôt because it makes me sore and doesn‚Äôt seem to make a difference for me, but I also have no injuries or chronic pain. For spine injuries, especially related to car accidents, it can help people a lot."
