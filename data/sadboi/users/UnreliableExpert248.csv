JonBenet,ey2e0ax,t1_ey26289,1566736475.0,"I think the fact that the Ramsey team never leaked the test results which show how Leberge was able to ""deduce"" the UM1 profile is pretty telling.  Anything that might even remotely spread reasonable doubt they've had no trouble leaking to a vocal minority of individuals... but this, which could truly be something that could help their case, they keep these results under lock and key.

(Also)Its true you can't ""convert"" loci to see if they match with different loci.  That'd be like converting a picture of a foot to see if it matched a person's eye color."

JonBenet,exormb9,t1_exor0e5,1566480802.0,"Typically when a person's argument has devolved into single worded and meaningless replies it's a sign they're beaten in the debate... but are attempting to win the ""last word contest"" so they can walk away with at least some semblance of ""victory"". 

I'll let you have that much, at least."
JonBenet,exopopv,t1_exomi64,1566480028.0,"You're opinion is similar to saying ""There's no evidence whatsoever that unicorns didn't exist in North Korea.""

It isn't up to anyone...   Not scientists, South Koreans, historians,  or little girls with wild imaginations to prove there weren't unicorns in North Korea. 

It's up to the people making the claim that unicorns once frolicked around the North Korean forests to PROVE unicorns existed there. 

You're basically saying ""unless you prove me wrong then I'm right""."
JonBenet,exodz9o,t1_exobc71,1566474785.0,"Its up to the person making the unsubstantiated claim to provide proof, not the person who isn't making the unsubstantiated claim. 

He claims there were 3 viable suspects - Patsy, John, and Burke.  This is undisputed fact. 

You seem to be of the opinion the was someone else in the house.   That is not an undisputed fact.

It's not up to him/her to prove there WEREN'T more.   Its up to you to prove there WERE more."

JonBenet,eug07uc,t1_eufzwxr,1563796614.0,I'm glad we agree.   It is not fair to the families of the people being wrongfully accused to have their loved ones defamed on the internet after police clear them.   That's all im sayin
