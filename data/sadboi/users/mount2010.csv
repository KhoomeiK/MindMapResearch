Typically I will have to sleep to recover from a meltdown.

Also: if your sister has trouble finding or retaining a job (for example), it might help to ask IMH to refer her to a social service agency. There are organizations which help autistic people in particular.

Edit: It's also worth to mention meltdowns come from negative stimuli that normal people may or may not understand (i.e. loud noises), or also from overwhelming stress."

singapore,fqlkarp,t1_fqlbt9u,1589460271.0,"Hello, I'm a formally diagnosed autistic. One thing that can help a lot is to educate yourself about mental illnesses, and try not to automatically classify anyone you cannot relate to as ""siao"". As an autistic, I have meltdowns. These are situations where you'd think of me as ""siao"" - I'll roll on the floor, crying, or attempt to hide myself (to get myself away from stimuli). One thing I notice is that certain people become aggressive at me while I am having a meltdown. I think this is because mental  illness is something unfamilar to them, and their ""fight or flight"" reaction kicks in. Another thing is to realize that we are humans too, and that laughing or commenting about our state as if we cannot understand it does not help. I saw this happen in the video of Kaur - an old man told her ""you better wear"". I could actually relate that to instances when classmates acted aggressively rather than kindly to me while I was having a meltdown. 
I don't want to make a judgement about Kaur. I do not know whether she is actually mentally ill, or whether such mental illness should compensate for her act of assaulting another person or being defiant. But, greater understanding of mental illness, which you can get by, for example, reading the personal experiences of the mentally ill on blogs -  will go a long way. And I'd love to be accepted as a person who has a unique experience of the world, which is different from what normal people experience and build up their world to be, and occasionally causes issues due to my differences."

They're known as people who push for a ""cure"" rather than acceptance of autistic people. Also, the ads.  They made a bunch of ads that showed parents who talk about their autistic children as if they weren't in the room. Obviously, us autistics aren't happy with them.

The real ""autism acceptance"" charity is Autism Self-Advocacy Network (ASAN).
