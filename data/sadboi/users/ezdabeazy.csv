How long have you been on this dose if you don't mind me asking? How many times have you made it to the other side of a withdrawal from any opiates and has it ever been methadone? Only asking bc methadone is way different to wd than other opiates, it's way harder, way longer, way ""achier"".

You most likely won't be there in any sense accept a physical body drenched in sweat moaning and puking and shitting while confined in a bathroom for days at a time.

I had Kratom, I had Lyrica and Gabapentin, I had Clonadine and some other ""knock me out"" drugs but when I went CT off of EIGHTY mg's the Kratom didn't even begin to really work until 6+ days of severe unadulterated hell of a withdrawal.

It's wonderful news to hear u got Kratom tho that should help a LOT. Regardless imo you're making a bad decision. I totally get why and where it's probably coming from I had the same feelings. I'd become so aggravated with dealing with trying to get off of this shit that I tried multiple times to suddenly CT stop. It doesn't work for the large majority of people.

RecreationalKratom,fr3qspi,t1_fqyvzen,1589863768.0,"I would say neither tbh. It has a euphoric sort of stimulation but also has a pain killing effect too. If I'm not mistaken it's a species of the coffee so it makes sense how it's stimulating.

It's a unique substance because it has both opioid agonist and antagonist receptor activation making it sort of work both ways... It's an opioid. Codiene and oxycodone are made from the opium poppy so they are opiates not opioids, Kratom is a whole different plant that has chemicals that activate the same receptors (among others) as the opium poppy. Opiates = from the opium poppy. Opioids = other made or plant based drugs that activate the same receptors as opiates.

The Sumarians cultivated the opium poppy I think around 7,000 years ago; probably from cross breeding various plants that were opioids to make the well known opium poppy. In a sense it's domesticated opioid plants from nature turned into one well made plant a lot like how they breed out great weed strains.

So I guess to answer your question it will have similarities but it's hard to pin down. You won't get the pins and needles ""warm blanket"" feeling imo it's a different substance.

These are just my opinions I hope it all works out for you, it's a wonderful medicine."

Do you have any sources for this? Mayo Clinic has a long paper that demonizes Kratom yet I went there for a health issue and I was put on high dose opiates for years. They were fine with giving me drugs that could easily kill me and turn me into an addict but they'll go on and on about how horrible Kratom supposedly is.

There's a major financial threat to Big Pharma with Kratom. It is extremely cheap, takes a very small amount to work well (honestly less is more due to the agonist and antagonist opioid receptors in it) and it has a very high LD50. Opiates have a long production line going from Afghanistan all the way to our pharmacies and have the largest health risk of addiction and death. Kratom doesn't have that. The biggest health risk is nausea, vomiting and the ""kratom wobbles"".

As long as the product your friend has is actually Kratom and you can trust him then you'll most likely be completely fine if you dose very low and slowly move up. For safety I'd recommend not taking a lot the first time only take a gram or so then you'll be able to gauge better how well it works and go from there.

Hope it all works out bc it's a wonderful medicine when used responsibly. When used irresponsibly it makes you feel like shit, also a good thing imo."

Then to say it was made up by some guy who now ""got caught and has COVID-19 fucking his mistress"" is far fetched if not a right out lie. We can source it out if you'd like?

Look into pandemic research. The idea of making sure the healthcare industry isn't being swamped so bad it kills 10x's as many people isn't some made up theory it makes logical and literal sense. Th healthcare workers can't get so sick they all die out and can't help people. 1,500 healthcare workers got sick at the hospital in my neighborhood which is in a metro city. I saw more than enough twitter videos etc. of our over ran hospital that there definitely is this big disconnect between the metro and rural areas as to how dangerous and insidious this virus is.

Look into how FEMA delivers goods to hurt areas it takes logistics and planning you don't just run 50 buses down to a flooded out zone. Or I mean our gov. did but maybe you get what I mean...

Does a lockdown until a vaccine is found make sense too? Or treating the rural areas the same as if they are dense areas like where I live? No I don't think that makes sense at all either.

My experience is with 'done. I needed to be in severe withdrawal until it would work for me and it had to be below 30mg/day but with all that said everyone is different. If you are on say, 8mg of subs a day then you are in a sort of bind.

Just try out 3 grams mixed up in some OJ or just toss and wash it and see how you feel. Once you begin to feel good after about 5-10 hrs. (whatever is needed for you) then repeat as needed. Play around with it, plz don't give up on it too quick.

You have PAWS to account for after the physical withdrawals. Kratom saved me and many others from this insidious addiction. Kratom helps give you space between the high and reality letting you better manage your life and see a clearer picture.

In the beginning Kratom won't ""cover"" you, it takes until you are pretty sick before it begins to really work (at least in my situation..) however once it does begin to work it has both receptor agonist and antagonist so it works best by taking less.

Find a dose that works and take it until you feel the ""Kratom spins"". At that time take about a 1/3rd less. Once you are down to where you can take it every day and not get the spins or feel crippled from withdrawal it's a medicine that can help you gain stability.

It saved my life. I'm currently on about 2 grams twice a day still mitigating PAWS and dealing with chronic pain but my life is drastically different now.

ACT Therapy, CBT, REBT, psychedelics help to find a new way to *think* about the way you live life. Finding a new family of people to be around with shared goals and beliefs i.e. not addicts. Moving to another area completely to get away from the environment you've been so used to that triggers your addictive personality. These all are more important than any amount of SSRI's or whatever other medical intervention you may think is necessary to heal an addict.

It's a perspective shift in life that changes addictive personalities. This takes effort, anything in life worth anything takes effort and practice and perseverance and belief/faith. Medical intervention for the addict just furthers them down the road of dependence. They are off of drugs but now are on an emotional blunting effect of some anti-depressant they eventually will gain tolerance to, or in a rehab around a bunch of other addicts talking about how much they wish they could use, or in an AA/NA doing the same, or talking to their doctor who doesn't know shit about addiction that leads them down another contrived medicalized bullshit route.

These are outdated ways of addressing addiction. Addiction is a habitual thought disorder that needs to be broken down not by trying to fix all the symptoms but instead by trying to find and fix the cause, otherwise you're just wasting time. Finding that cause is typically around the way you view and live life. Typically it's also around past trauma and current views on the way things are that are faulty and mis-percieved due to current or previous drug use.

These ofc are just my opinions.. I'm not trying to be argumentative. I disagree adamantly that medical intervention is the right way to fix addiction. It's a round robin trap. I've been through all of it so I wanted to share my point of view. Big Pharma was just a bunch of garb bullshit of wasted time and money fed by lies. I didn't really begin getting clean until I began to clean my thoughts. 

I could rant and rant so I'll chill out.... sry!

addiction,fqwerlj,t1_fqttncc,1589701830.0,"Thank you for your service, honestly it is awesome to read people are dedicated to trying to help us addicts.

I myself suffer chronic pain since my teens from a thing I was born with so using opiates was pretty much explained in detail by doctors as the ""only way I'll have any sort of quality of life"" which I ate up like candy. I mean I remember more than one doctor going into great detail about how ""this is your maintenance opiate, this is for breakthrough pain, this is for sleep"" etc.

It's true though. I do go through chronic pain every day and I was able to manipulate my screwed up life by way of a couple medications. Then they suddenly out of nowhere after over a decade of opiate use they dropped me in ONE MONTH 2 years ago and it has put my life into a downward spiral ever since. Grand mal seizure, a torturous traumatic withdrawal, no safety net as I had no time to plan. Lost my job, almost got evicted, went through the worst stress during one of the worst times of my life.

It's like they want to just get us out of the way and don't care how well we do. I felt like I was being treated like vermin.

During this COVID experience if I'm honest I find it interesting and slightly humorous how big of a deal people are now making about *their* lives now that it directly effects them. All the while people are suffering from a myriad of health issues while they gut disability and do nothing except ""meditate and try yoga"" and take Motrin to now get a meaningful life back together.

It's a severe lack of compassion and empathy which is just the times we live in I suppose......"
Methadone,fqwdsu6,t1_fqvpa5i,1589700873.0,"It all depends on dose and how long you've been using. If you get on 'done at a spot that stabilizes you just go super slow and continue to let your body stabilize on the new lowered dose. If you begin to feel sick you can stay at your dose until you feel ready to lower again. They can do like, .25 of a mg increments so it's way way easy if you do it by the usual MMT plan.

I've kicked opiates a bunch too. Methadone is sort of a creepy thing because it's so fucking hard to quit vs. short acting opiates if you're on a high dose and go CT. The 2 don't even compare. Opiates are from the poppy plant so your body is able to excrete them and ""recognize"" them bc they've been around since the Sumarian's cultivated it like 8,000 yrs. ago.

Methadone though is fully synthetic it's made in a lab. Your body has more issues excreting/metabolizing it because it causes a different sort of issue with NMDA receptors. This is why methadone feels so achy and sore vs. other opiates.

So just jump off at a low dose. Getting dropped or going CT off of 120mg/day after a few months of being on it is a well known medical torture method in our current age - it goes on FOOORREVVERRR and you'll feel this sort of aches in the joints and extreme awake feeling, sort of like you have a bright light shining on your consciousness all the time that short acting opiates don't have imo.

If you've ever quit a heavy benzo wd it's sort of similar to that feeling, the ""light on and flurry of thoughts w/no sleep"" feeling.

I'd prefer a CT heavy drop off a short acting opiate over 'done any day. The majority agrees on this."

Well there's also cleaning the sweat drenched sheets... After you jump in you got about 5 min. of a sort of good time before they get drenched again. To each their own I suppose."
Methadone,fqwctln,t1_fqw023u,1589699906.0,"No science isn't on your side with this. Severe withdrawals make people more desperate to get away from the feeling and increase cravings significantly. This is why they have methadone and subs it's to slow down that excruciating pain to more of a trickle bc severe withdrawals are no joke.. They're traumatic imo.

They're finding that with more of a rat park type of situation works. If you get a different lifestyle going while in detox/MMT then it can allow one to see life from a different perspective which is really what needs to happen to get clean and stay clean."

My brain doesn't feel like it's walking through water to think either which it sounds like you're getting those same effects. Also I'm so much more awake and able to regulate my sleep it's been actually a great sort of energy I've gained since getting off. 

I do feel like saying though -

>Who ever said paws lasts for 6-12 months I don’t think so. If you go  cold turkey and don’t put anymore drugs into your system you will  recover, it took me 63 days from start to finish to get rid of all my  symptoms.

Nooo man so many things come into play in the ability of someone to withdrawal from methadone. How long and what opiates/opioids they've been on is a major factor so in other words how long it will take for the receptors to downregulate enough in your brain for your body to find homeostasis. Couple that with how everyone's biological makeup can cause various changes in the ability to metabolize methadone and the long 100+ hr. half life of methadone that compounds itself when taken for years and what you say above turns into just your situation and shouldn't be carried over to others. It's awesome it went so well for you, this is sort of a nitpicky thing to bring up but it feels relevant to my situation so I wanted to pass it along.

I mean.. on top of those examples there are mental and physical disorders that can prolong the PAWS along with environmental. It's not safe or fair to say that since it went this well for you others should jump off at 80 because it'll be **slap hands** all done and good 2 go in only 2 months time. I know from first hand experience this didn't work at all for me.

When I split dosed I would feel just sorta crappy all day long, instead of pretty crappy for the last 5 hrs. of it or so or after waking up.

Everyone is different though, everyone's dependency amount and for how long along with their biology and their diet and sleep and exercise - all of this comes into play.

For sure though imo the first thing to do is just sit at your dose for a couple weeks until it calms down, then lower your dose a lot slower after you've stabilized. It's what has worked for me.."

I made the usual mistake of expecting privacy.

I heard someone at the bottom of the stairs. I suddenly stopped crying and quickly walked over to the top of the stairs but was afraid to look down them. I then heard my dad making all this purposefully loud noises and saying ""well, goin' to bed.."" or some ""well I don't give a shit, gotta make sure you know"" kind of remark.

Something about that whole experience taught me that I no longer need to change my behavior around them as they wouldn't care either way.

>  
>learned about trigger points

Yea I back up what this person is saying completely. Opiates are a zero sum game especially if you've already gone through the gamut with them. They bring dependence, then tolerance, actually stop you from moving around as much and being in touch with your back. They are more of a sedative than people give them credit especially in higher doses. You become a lesser version of yourself. Quitting pain pills was one of the better things I've done for my back not even to mention my life...

I get trigger point deep tissue massage too from someone who's been trained in it and it matters a lot with muscle spasms in the back and sciatica. Your body is a bunch of layered muscles (especially your back it's got muscles going from your vertebrae to your ribs for example) and if a lower layer gets caught up you'll feel sort of this ""ball"" or ""knot"" if it's bad enough but sometimes it'll just feel like inflexibility. Either way what deep tissue does, imo, is allow this area to release it's pent up blood and get normal functioning circulation going. My therapist often uses a technique called the ""tourniquet effect"".

So yea I didn't want to ramble on and on [in my post above](https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/gi4ut6/completed_my_7th_day_of_opiate_withdrawal_and/fqdialp?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) with recommendations but this guy is right on the money it's a huge healer imo. It's way better than getting loaded up on pills and not realizing how much damage you're doing to your back when you move a couch in a daze and can't even feel all the poppin and locking going on until the next day as you desperately reach for the bottle after waking up from horrible sleep."
addiction,fqdialp,t1_fqcsd0e,1589290272.0,"I suffer sciatica from a health condition from my teens. What's worked for me is to practice yoga but only light yoga, ones that are geared for your low back. If it puts strain on you at all wait and continue to do the easier ones as you have all the time you need to move up.

Next thing that worked for me was going to a physical therapist. Not just any therapist though as I've been to horrible ones and they can make it way worse. The one that seemed to work out finally was one who was able to do tests to notice my left side was significantly weaker than my right even though I could do all their endurance exercises to the max; it was actually my inflexibility that was causing my sciatica. She said that because I kept exercising so much it very likely could be causing an increase in muscle tension and further pinching my sciatic nerve. With that said though she didn't tell me to stop exercising only to begin these slow but methodical workouts that isolate specific muscles that most workouts don't do. This strengthened that weak side.

It's now called ""pseudo-science"" on Wikipedia.. which really surprises me but at the same time doesn't. Regardless, I would highly recommend going to get some chiropractor adjustments from *a very well* trained chiropractor. You get it done by some guy who's just figuring it out and he can wreck you for a week like what's happened to me...

Finally MEDS means a lot. Meditate/contemplate/pain journal/ use a ""what's happening and why and in what pattern"". Exercise - keep up walking at the very least you need to move around. Diet - make sure you remove sugars and caffiene they tend to overload my sciatica (this varies I'm sure, mine is really really bad) and finally, the most important if you suffer sciatica but difficult to do in this active crazy life is sleep make sure you get quality restful sleep in whatever position you feel the most comfortable in.

These are all the quickest ones off the top of my head. I've suffered intense sciatic flare ups that landed me in the E.R. more than a few times so feel free to DM me if you'd like to talk to a fellow survivor of this invisible but insidious and *painful* condition.

Hey bro from someone who's been actively doing this sort of thing over the last 3 years to get over a slew of unhealthy habits, this works! Think of your brain like a muscle though cuz at first it was hard for me to say it and believe in it and I always felt so drained since my energy was always flakey and hard to pin down. 

However that whole ""fake it to make it"" should instead say ""condition your mind to best overcome this obstacle"" bc that's what it feels to me when I practice these sorts of things.

Here's just one I was going to post but after putting it up it just seemed pretty trivial vs. what everyone else is saying. I was walking down a main road of a major city, a movie has been made after the road it's so notorious...

I see a car and I see that there's some sort of fire within it. My natural instincts kick in and I begin to run to the car thinking that there might be 2 people inside and somehow they can't get out or something, I wasn't really sure. When I got close I began to yell just to try and get other people's attention. In retrospect this is *not the way you act* at 3am on a Friday night in the ghetto but like i said, it was just this natural ""I need to help these people!"" kind of instinct.

I get close and I realize there's this group of people standing around the car. For some reason none of them answered my yells or seemed creeped out by me or anything. I get closer and closer and I realize it's just people from around the area making a sort of circle around this burning car.

Suddenly (I can't explain how sudden and intense this was) but there was a big billow of smoke that was coming up from the bottom of the car into the inside which had the windows shut. The pressure of the fire gasping for oxygen from below became too much inside the car and it goes BOOM! and all the windows blast out with little shards of glass flying everywhere. The fire immediately lights up the whole interior and the flames were going I'd say at least 6 ft. high, it was this big blow torch looking thing.

I begin to realize how totally fucking weird and stupid it was to stand around watching a car being firebombed with all these people I didn't know. Everyone else wasn't talking but they were taping it on their phones and they all seemed just tired and depressed, it was really really creepy and weird.

I realize what's finally going on and am just like, yea, ""fuck this going home"" so I begin to walk home.

In the median of the road there's a guy standing dressed in all black with a black hoodie and something covering his mouth. He has some shit next to him I'm suspecting it was a gas can but really who knows. It totally sucks living in a ghetto area and ofc and I made the mistake of making too much eye contact for too long a time with this guy and then making it obvious that I sort of was now trotting to get home. In other words I showed obvious fear which is a no no imo in the ghetto it's like people can smell it on you...

I get about a block and I did that sort of ""looking down at my shoes or seeing something on the ground"" and peek behind me to see that this guy is following me and has his hoodie tied tight around his face and something covering it and is a lot closer than he was before. My heart began to pound out my my chest bc suddenly I realize that I could be in some real deep shit here and I can't explain how but I just knew it was him who had started the firebomb of the old car.

I began running and he doesn't run but he does sort of trot or walk faster. I got to my block but instead of going home bc I was afraid he was trying to find where I lived I instead went to the Wall-mart and camped out there and called a friend I knew who came and picked me up only to drop me off 2 min. away.

They were telling me ""aww this is the hood man that shit happens, you were fine. You had your cell phone right?"" This was when I first began to realize that this place doesn't think logically or rationally. Like, yea I had my cell phone but who the fuck knows what could have happened had I NOT seen this guy and taken a shorter route to my house that went into a darker lit area? Who knows all sorts of ways that could have been a setup. I know that sounds paranoid but with all the other experiences I've had it isn't paranoia to me..

The worst part of all this is I have 2 other stories that are creepy. as. fuck. that are a lot like this. One is just so sad and depressing I don't think I ever want to tell anyone about it. Fuck the ghetto man. The only people that live there are people that have to. You figure out a way to get out and you do otherwise you're an idiot imo....

Sorry a bit off topic of all the other stories and I know it doesn't sound like much and I went on for way too long but, wow did this whole experience rattle me. I began to act different immediately and realized right quick where I was, no more wondering after that experience.

AskReddit,fpz074s,t1_fpxtn8i,1589011197.0,yea I mean who knows I suppose... I'm just pointing out it is a thing people can do and way more information is publicly available then most people naturally assume.
AskReddit,fpyzryo,t1_fpy15lg,1589011042.0,"Yea definitely. You work at the same place day in and day out, right? He waits till you go to your car and gets your license plate. That's just one of a number of different ways they can get your info all the way up to your DNA on a cup you throw away. It would creep most people out a lot if they knew how public all of their information is especially if they are active on social media.

Just do a search for ""how to find people's publicly identifiable information"" and you'll get search engines that you can pay some money to that will give things like the following:

Who owns a car by their license plate.
Who are all the family members of some person.
What their political affiliation is.
Where they have lived, what kind of car they drive, what kind of trouble they've been in, what their prior work history is, whether they have pets, what their mom does for work their dad does for work, all the info on their siblings, what they have posted on FB, Instagram, Twitter, what friends they are most active with on those sites, info on all of those friends, people who recently died that they know, what their ethnicity is etc. etc.

For instance at the [following site](https://lifehacker.com/five-best-people-search-engines-5138427) that gives a pretty weak but quick run down of only some of the various PII search engines it says you can get the following...

""including blog entries, photos, publications, donations on public record, profiles on social and business networking sites, and other overlooked sources. Supports searching by name, username, phone number, and email.""

Once you aggregate enough info you can then add that info into even better lookup sites that require more PII to give you their info (Spock is sorta ok at this from the above link) and it's just insane... The best sites don't advertise heavily because they want to remain discrete and are used more by law enforcement and detectives.

If it's on the internet and you posted it then it's searchable forever by these archiving sites. I found out all the laws my family members have broken for instance a long while back and they were all shocked I knew this info suddenly - that kind of thing.

If you still don't believe me I can go into it more if you'd like. Detectives have an easy job nowadays that's for sure.

Have a nice weekend."

OutOfTheLoop,fpyidd8,t1_fpvk1kw,1589004412.0,"Don't you think this is just a little bit of a backwards way to see it?

>These guys are letting the anarchy of the internet do as it does

I say we all sign a petition to have r/outoftheloop the goat.se gaping anus on it's page and that's it. If it passes let the anarchy do as it does, quit being authoritative. It's lame. The mods should listen. /s

&#x200B;

The reason why they let this happen is because a bunch of people that are diametrically opposed to r/worldpolitics for whatever reason come flocking to the site to add their ""signature"" to this petition or protest or trolling or whatever you want to call it. Then places like this sub discuss it so more people go to it to see the car wreck and all around, none of it has nothing to do with the sub it's just a circle jerk of attempted jokes that everyone's used to by now.

It's allowed bc it brings unique visitors and increases traffic, that's all. Then they go and shutdown ""The\_Donald"" censoring free speech. I don't like Trump *at all* but we're talking about one of the most viewed websites on the internet pretending they don't have the manpower or finances to moderate one of their most popular subs.

There's no rhyme or reason to why the Reddit admins do what they do except to get people talking and arguing imo...

I'm just sharing my thoughts, have a good weekend."
OutOfTheLoop,fpyej1d,t1_fpxeqkk,1589002519.0,">The worst/best example of this were the people who spammed gore/nsfw stuff for no reason at all.

Yea classic troll behavior. It would be awesome if Reddit were to step in and auto delete that trash like they obviously can by way of AI, like youtube finally began doing. Oh well hopefully things will change.

I've been thinking about applying to mod for a sub I like but I keep hearing stories from other ex-mods or current mods that just about all of it is cleaning up troll poop while getting constant complaints from the users of the more troll poop that just showed up.

I've been helping out on the side lines in creating a FAQ and other side bar like stuff instead.

It's cool you at least gave it your best shot like it sounds..."

OutOfTheLoop,fpycelx,t1_fpwye55,1589001210.0,"Reddit has significantly degraded over time. There are now multiple off shoot sites like ruqqus and [saidit.net](https://saidit.net) among others that are pro-trump or conspiracy sites mostly.

Reddit is one of the most visited websites in the world with an ad that shows up about ever 5 sub in your feed, yet they somehow don't have enough manpower or finances to be actual admin and moderate like they should.

For all we know they are totally fine with what happened with r/worldpolitics. They probably helped get it going it ranks them even higher.

""Wow the views onto r/worldpolitics are lower but they are all first timers or haven't been to that sub in ages or even our site..""

""yea but it's just a bunch of b.s. why should we leave it that way?""

""Because, we'll make a lot more money in ads. People will flock to it that are pro-trump to a sub that is mostly anti-trump. We let them have their popcorn popping bouncing in their seat fun and then after a long while we'll fix it. As of right now why fix it we're making $ the only goal we have with this company.""

""Oh yea, I forgot China took over a big part of this site and now we don't really give a shit about administration and moderation only arguments and circle jerk jokes.""

""Yea you can't forget that man... It's really important we could lose our jobs if we actual treat this like a legit website like how it was founded by the guy that we...""

You get the idea hopefully. Then after awhile they'll do it by censoring speech the other way. It'll be a pro-trump sub like ""The\_Donald"" that they'll take down but then let those people flock to new subs that will eventually all end up in, whadyaknow, another variation of ""The\_Donald"".

So long as they keep interest in the site they're doing their job.

This post itself is on a timer I'm sure to be removed by their ""anti-evil operations"" team. Whatever Orwellian silliness that's supposed to mean..."
OutOfTheLoop,fpy523s,t1_fpvcdl1,1588996165.0,"> people seem to forget that reddit mods are just as dumb and immature as the rest of us.

This is generally true however it's different to every specific sub which is sort of the cool thing about Reddit. I constantly add subs into my stream that would seem to interest me, see how they are moderated and if the community treats each other with respect of if it's just a joking circle jerk or everything has to be an argument and not a debate and the sidebar if you try to report someone talking about child sex abuse or killing or something has some cute little ""I want to report because I'm a little bitch"", that sort of thing. I see it more and more as Reddit continues to degrade over time.

Then after about a few months I ""cut the weeds and prune the flowers"" and remove any subs I've been finding to be moderated poorly or have communities of memer jokers and rudeness.

Only saying this bc there are definitely subs out there that seem to be moderated well or at least communities that are decent to each other and respectful.

Nothing like Reddit used to be but nothing seems to last in it's golden age in technology. I remember YouTube back in like, 2008 I think or around that time and it was full of DIY fun and interesting things to watch with all the comments being fairly positive and respectful. We all know how that went once money took over so it's always a sort of cat and mouse game I suppose..."
