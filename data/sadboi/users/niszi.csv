1. In case you believe in God: he often describes Himself as The Light in the Bible. Also, he appeared in the form of strong physical light (not just metaphorically) to people. He also says He'll be the only source of light in heaven and there will be no sun. So it was easy for Him to keep everything alive with His light until He created the sun.

If my best friend wouldn't text me for weeks, I'd be fine. I love her but... I can't even continue this idea because I genuinely don't know??! Like wtf is wrong with me?
