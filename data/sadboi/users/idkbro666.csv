keto,fqqghie,t3_gkdscy,1589565109.0,"Hey friend! Congrats on the wedding and good for you wanting to be healthier. I lost 40lbs in 7 months doing the keto diet and I didn’t buy anything other than healthier foods to eat. Gimmicks will get you short term results, but it’s nearly impossible to maintain. For long term, sustainable weight loss, you gotta eat good healthy foods, stop going out to eat, and just ensure that you are in a caloric deficit (aka eating less calories than you burn in a day). Exercising can also help speed along the process, but from my experience, it was changing my diet that got me the best results. Two years later I have kept the weight off. Good luck to you and again, this is just my two cents ☺️"

No one in my life would understand if I told them that I don’t really want to die but at the same time I think about suicide on a daily basis. I don’t think I’d ever go through with it which makes existence even more painful, knowing that I’m gonna wanna die everyday but never have the balls to do it. What an existence eh."

Loneliness is a really painful feeling. I’m so sorry you’re going through it as it can be all consuming. Try to distract yourself and remember that this is only temporary. Every day you do it is one less day you’ll have to do it again. Stay focused on the future and facetime daily. It’s all gonna be okay. Just breathe."

KindVoice,fg5f4vp,t3_ewz207,1580525801.0,Hi love. Deep breaths. Some people don’t know how to handle the emotions of others. Often times it’s because they have their own pain that they’ve buried so deep down and seeing others in pain can be triggering and cause them to retreat. The only person you can depend on to heal is yourself. You do not need anyone’s validation but yours. Find your inner strength and trust that the universe has a plan for you.
KindVoice,ffs45n5,t3_euvgp6,1580172683.0,"I totally relate to your experience. You verbalized really big and overwhelming feelings so well and that’s even a great start to healing. I think you need to tell yourself that you’re disconnected from people and that’s okay. It’s okay to not want to go out all the time. It’s okay that you want to be alone. It’s okay to be scared to be hurt again. It’s okay to just stay home and do literally nothing if doing that makes you feel more at peace. Not everyone is a people person, especially not after going through painful or traumatic experiences. You’ll find someone who understand and accepts and loves that part of you. A partner who fears getting hurt is a partner who is not likely to hurt others. Just be genuine and honest and love and accept yourself for who you are, and you’ll attract someone who does too."
KindVoice,ffbprtl,t3_esowji,1579777621.0,"[O] F 22. Hello friend! I think learning more about yourself and seeing that there’s other people like you can help you feel less alone. Take the MBTI 16 personalities test and read up on why you are the way you are. I am an INFJ and it’s crazy how accurate the description was. It was like giving words to feelings I’ve never been able to describe. If you ever want a distracted or a place to vent feel free to send me a message, okay? It’s gonna be okay as long as you believe it will be."
KindVoice,ffb3yh1,t3_esj7ys,1579751173.0,"Not to be a downer but literally anything you’re worried about now is not gonna matter in 5 years. You’ll have different priorities, different concerns. In fact you’ll only have a few memories from high school. 4 years of your life don’t define the rest, high school is a brief moment in time and there’s your whole life ahead of you where no one will care how many friends you had or how popular you were or how many weekends you spend alone. It will only matter how you treat yourself and how you treat others."

People but on a brave face and broadcast their happy lives on social media but it’s all a front.

socialanxiety,eogu3tx,t3_brqwn4,1558565772.0,I can relate and I feel for you. It’s oddly comforting that Im not the only one. I don’t know why I feel uncomfortable around legit everyone. Socializing is honestly painful and so anxiety ridden but I’m depressed when I’m on my own. What a miserable existence - I hope these feelings go away one day and I can get back to who I used to be.
