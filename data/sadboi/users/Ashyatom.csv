product_design,fqp84dh,t1_fqp7f9h,1589538419.0,"Cheers. We’ve pivoted a lot to try and get a product / market, I just sometimes can feel a little deflated. I’m sure many Designers feel this way on and off. I certainly did when working in agency. Just wanted to write it somewhere to get it off my chest."
UI_Design,fqp58ve,t3_geh3l8,1589535483.0,"Like the idea. Just a few things:  


\- That Android bottom navigation wouldn't follow you into the menu twice like how you have it in the mockup. I can tell you quickly did a burger menu system without thinking too much about the UX.  


\- The icon used for Benefits looks more like a controller than for Benefits. A present? Star perhaps?  


\- The images aren't really helping on the left screen, they don't add anything."

UI_Design,fqp0jkf,t3_gk4w21,1589530730.0,"It’s really cute! Just a few little things:

- Search in the Search Bar on the left screen isn’t spelt correctly.

- The difference in text from uppercase to sentence case in the Add to Cart button on the right screen is unusual. I’d suggest all Uppercase.

- No need for the word Price on the right screen. The dollar sign implies the price.

- The spacing between titles and subtitles on the rectangles in Latest Toys is uncomfortable and a little misaligned. Tightening them up by bringing the titles down a little could be better."

It doesn’t break the UX of the app nor makes it unable for users to achieve their goals, and only a small percentage of their user base will see this.

UI_Design,fqdkaub,t1_fqdifvs,1589291463.0,"Thanks for the feedback, I design apps, interfaces and brands etc for a living so I'm glad you can see that off the bat, even with the above just being a conceptual restyle.

\- Thanks for spotting that. It's something I would be mindful of when there's more than just 1 digit in there. The circle itself would expand into a pill, again like other badges in apps.

\- The filler text in regards to the visuals on incoming messages would truncate after a set character length and be kept to one line, like in most chat apps, to prompt the user to tap to find out more and to not push all their other chats off screen.

\- Though they seem quite large here, maybe smaller could be better, but I am using it to attract the eye and feel modern as oppose to the really tiny fonts that are often in many chat apps (and Grindr itself currently).

\- There will be an off-black gradient blur coming from the bottom of all imagery which will cater for the white text. If there was ever an image not uploaded, there would be a default background image put in its place.

And many thanks, I appreciate the feedback."

A quick check on something app related on whether it's conceptual or possible is to think if it's going to fit on an iPhone 5s / SE or below for Android. It's not too difficult because everybody uses the median iPhone X art board as their default for presentations.
