Anxiety,fodt0l4,t1_fo58zsl,1587689574.0,"Im unsure what you are asking, I have an idea, and it is a fantastic question.

A good therapist is gold. But a ""good therapist"" depends a lot on the patient. How open are you willing to be? Remember, regardless of the ""type of therapy"", if the patient is unwilling to open up, there is nothing there. 

I was actually meaning more scientific.Therapy is not very scientific . It is still very much helpful. The thing is, with therapy, each individual case is going to be so very different from the next. Its all subjective, which plays a massive role when it comes to medications. All meds are given based on symptoms, which vary wildly. We seriously are in our infancy, but we are getting there.  

Many critique medications , as if they expect us to have the ability  to customize them, thats not possible.



My suggestion to any new to therapy, or considering it, is to be as open as possible. Leave your shame at the door, pour your heart out, cry, whatever. They are not going to see you as anything but one in pain, and they deal with it on a daily basis, plus, as an added bonus, a therapist is also human.

Excellent reply, thank you for that."

People keep whining about ""the system"". Wrong, it starts with is. Mental health is looked down upon, theres the stigma, because people do not under the issue. It also has to do with the language we use. Some hear ""anxiety"",  and confuse it for situational anxiety.   


People who put down others, due to mental health issues, and I had 99% of my family against me in this, yet I did not give a fuck. I wasnt bitter about. I didnt whine to them saying ""You just do not get it!!!"". They cannot get it because they do not understand having constant anxiety.

Two days ago I stopped taking medication for schizoaffective disorder, which carries with it, of course, severe anxiety. Against my doctors advice, I decide to try something else. After working all day, I leave work and jog 10 miles. I cannot stress this enough, you CAN control it, but it takes loads of effort.   


Each and every morning I have a panic attack , doesn't matter if I slept well or not. If I have a good breakfast; The attacks are there waiting for when I wake. I purposely decided to do landscaping for work, because it forces me to work out my body, therefore my mind. Then , after my jog, I come home and work out my mind by doing computer-related work.

I am not against extending life, we have already doubled our life times. To live forever, for example, that would be a mistake. Regardless of how much we progress, even if we figure out a way to quickly reproduce cells, or stop them from dying, which part of, or all, of what causes us to age,  our brains would suffer too much. 

It would take thousands, perhaps millions of years, to evolve our brains to handle living even hundreds of years longer. Our tech is going to improve massively in a very short time, but our brains are still as they were hundreds of thousands of years ago.

You're not ""abnormal"", your brain/you is/are reacting to extreme stress. Consider anxiety to be an alarm system. What we need to do, is learn how to tell the difference between an actual threat, and everyday situations. Its also interesting to note that the mind cannot tell the difference between a dream and waking life, just to give you an idea. We have incredibly brilliant, creative minds, but with all that you sometimes sacrifice comfort. We have brains which are adapted to MUCH different times, than we live in currently. We are still working out the kinks, so be patient with yourself. You are not insane, or losing it, you are a very complex animal, living in a  world which you have yet to adapt to.

I believe that , other than the pressure, humans break down in such a way because our brains are not quite used to dealing with so much information.

Personally, I am NOT for meds, but, I am also not against them.   


Drugs work for some, others, not so much. Some have bad experiences with doctors, others dont. Like mental health itself, it is SUBJECTIVE. Im sure some of us can agree on this being a fact.   


Look, like many here, I was nearly wrecked do to mental health issues. I was on several meds, and, one day, I was notified I could no longer see my therapist or psychiatrist. I was cut off, and we too gone to do anything about it myself. No help from family, most of whom ignored the fact I was dying inside. Each and every fucking day I had to come up with a new reason to not end myself. Its fucking torture. See, the issue in my case, is that I was going through different scripts to find out which worked. Thats how meds work, as we all know. What fucked up my situation, was I was too gone, too suicidal to care, to properly communicate what was going on.   


After I was cut, I , being prone to seizures already, began having them daily. I never want to go back to the days when I would walk the train tracks, contemplating stepping in front of a train. I did that, each and every night.   


It just sucks, trying so hard to just feel better. At the height of my sickness, I could feel nothing. Not pain, not joy. I would rather be in total agony, then feel nothing. At least then you know you're alive. I will die before I get back to that state.
