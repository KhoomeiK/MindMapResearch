antinatalism,fqftof9,t3_gievp0,1589331483.0,"Absolutely. Most people definitely are more empathetic with quadrupeds than their own species. It sounds completely insane but it appears to be true. We’ve been heading in this direction for a while now, because back in the day we used to view dogs as farm animals, so much so that a farmer or something was even recorded as saying (paraphrased:) ‘Fido died today. I cooked him up and he yielded 3 lb of grease.’ Literally. Could you imagine someone cooking up their dead dog nowadays? We’ve gone from that extreme to LITERALLY VIEWING THEM AS PEOPLE! They’re “members of our family,” and that is no exaggeration. A HUGE percentage of pet owners feel their quadruped pet is a member of their family akin to a child, hence “dog mom,” “dog dad,” “dog parents” getting thrown around nowadays, which always makes me cringe. (Now personally I’d prefer someone get a pet if it means they wouldn’t have a child but that’s another point for another time.) The idea is that we’ve been moving in that direction culturally for a while now, and I think the younger crowd is taking it to another level. I always remember Mark Twain I think it was with the quote like ‘I like my dog more than people’ or something like that, and I feel like that sentiment contributes to it. Personally, I don’t think it’s okay that we should abandon our brothers and sisters in practice or concept, because to me it’s a serious symptom of societal dysfunction that it is popular to think a quadruped is more understandable than someone you can actually talk to from your own species. But whatever, that’s just me. Now the point that really drives this home - EUTHANASIA IS LEGAL FOR PETS BUT NOT HUMANS! That’s right, Fido is suffering and we should HUMANELY ‘put him out of his misery’ because he has a hole in his jaw and can’t eat. What’s that? You’re a quadriplegic suicidal human that’s been begging to die your entire existence and has to live with feeding tubes or whatever and be supervised 24/7 so you don’t kill yourself with your constant attempts? LOL, fuck you, you gotta live with that shit, man! We can’t ‘put a human down,’ that’s MURDER! And I’m just sitting here the whole time like why can’t you motherfuckers apply the same empathy to your own species as you do for a fucking quadruped, that shit offends me. They think a dog’s body falling apart is too stressful for the dog to endure but a human that can self-reflect on the fact that they’ll never get better has to deal with even larger issues should just suffer until the bitter end no matter what, under all circumstances. It is so cruel, that we turn a blind eye to each other while we exclusively share our empathy with pets."

antinatalism,ffnu3eo,t1_ffimd8l,1580070839.0,"I think I understand what you’re saying. I’m an antinatalist but previous to this I wanted to have biological children with a wife and start a stereotypical American family. I have always loved children and dreamed of the day I would be a father. I used to supervise youngin’s during church services and always enjoyed talking to them because they are so honest and open about who they are. Honesty is one of my virtues and I can trash the “I’m a mAtUrEd aDuLt” posturing and just communicate with them rather directly, they can tell that I’m basically crazy - I don’t seem to repress myself emotionally, not afraid to look or be silly - and they think it’s hilarious. They get old enough and it’s like society beats that out of them and it makes me sad.
But my point is that that’s where I’ve come from. I used to horde data my whole life that could be useful to me and the wife when we had kids. I’ve had so many exes and others tell me what a great father I’m going to be someday. And all that can fuck right off!
Because I’ve realized the “why” ISN’T “for the sake of the child” - it’s purely me and my ape brain and I don’t have to accept that, just like I choose not to accept all kinds of things about what my body says it wants. It’s the same reason I am anti-violence and don’t strike people, even though I literally would hit the big red button and undo everyone if I could!
So my reason is if it’s ONLY for me, ESPECIALLY at the detriment of others, why the fuck would I do that?? I’m just more selfless than that, period. I’m not like others. I just couldn’t ignore my conscience like so many others can. It would literally contradict how I feel about everything I don’t like about life. And integrity is what I admire in myself and prioritize. I realized at a point in my life that the ACTUAL experience of having children would be horrifying to me, and everything I’ve felt about it can be explained as every other of my desires can - it was hard wired into my brain through millions of years of natural selection. I want kids for the same reason I get horny and the same reason I get thirsty. Yes, hunger literally compels me to survive because starving is more painful than making food for 10 minutes, but honestly it would be a relief if I never had to worry about eating again. How to deal with these desires or emotions or impulses? Good question. I assume these things in everyone are prioritized a little differently, and some are more tempting than others to different people. Personally I can starve all day but being horny and alone sometimes can be quite painful with no real solution for it. But I manage somehow because staying true to who I am is more important than satisfying the things that aren’t as important to me. I realized that there’s a reason I want to be a father, and it’s not because I think I would make a good one. It’s because it’s a part of who I am biologically and that’s literally it.
I simultaneously feel like I know that it would be an amazing experience for me to mix my genes with someone and create a new person, all the while I just shake my head and know I could never forgive myself for following through with it. I’ve chosen to deny my programming. I don’t actually feel that bad about it anymore, I actually feel more empowered knowing I’m doing what I REALLY want, which was the goal all along. Fortunately just being horny and alone is more painful to me than not having a child, and I can deal with all that, because I’m prioritizing things I deem more important.
Before I had sex the first time it was like my brain HAD to have it, because I could die tomorrow!! Then I realized that it’s completely overrated, and that “good sex” doesn’t make any sense to me. Now, I know I’m a lot happier horny and alone than I am going out dating people all the time who want this thing I don’t. The same thing happened to me with wanting bio kids. I focused on the idealized part with all the benefits so clearly in mind, and when I REALLY dug deep into it and thought about everything that actually COULD happen to that child, and was likely to, (everything I didn’t want to think about) I realized that it would be a selfish move on my part and if that kid ever said he hated his life like I sometimes do, I can’t even imagine how terrible I would feel about my biggest responsibility, because I already feel generally maxed out you know? I literally don’t know what the actual fuck life is, much less human life, much less sticking my hands into that and knowingly perpetuating something I don’t truly understand. I think it’s wild that on some level I want to operate this same creation machine my parents operated despite not even having a good enough reason to other than “I want one.” I realized I wouldn’t be able to justify my potential child’s life to him if he asked, and as someone whose virtue is honesty, I know I’ll never do it because it would make me a hypocrite and that’s unacceptable. That’s more painful than not having a kid I want.
I realize that I could have a life worth living just by facilitating the relationships around me that are important to me, and I don’t have to basically destroy someone’s vagina to do so, or be a father! I could literally still be a father if I could adopt and prove myself capable, so that option still exists.
I believe that with the rest of my time here, I have not only the power but the duty to stand alone and make a difference, to make the rest of my life anything other than a tragedy. That’s my duty! Because I don’t want to feel like I’ve wasted my time. I don’t have to have bio kids to make my life better and reduce suffering, I can try now.

What, you mean like you did? Almost everyone I know where I’m from is living paycheck to paycheck and would be fucked if they got a sudden expense, so who can actually afford to raise a child? Well, the people actually raising them think they can, because as it turns out, no matter how hard these peoples lives are, they almost NEVER see having children as a hardship. They believe that the birth of a child literally has the power to fix everything in their lives. When asked where they’d be if they never had kids, these women give bizarre answers like “I’d be lost. Dead. In jail. Still out partying.” Or even “nowhere at all..”
Where they once were nearly depressed, had no social prestige, relevance, or support, had very little sense of meaning or hope for the future - now a child pops into that space and temporarily fills that vacuum. Now she has prestige! Everyone wants to know the baby’s name and sex! Social support! I’m a mom now and I can relate with other moms! Now my baby daddy has this ‘real test’ of whether he’ll be a real man and step up to the plate or not.

But here’s the thing: If you have biological children, then that is a choice to perpetuate the human species and it automatically disqualifies you from the “I didn’t ask to be born” argument, as well as the idea that we have no responsibility for our offsprings’ future simply because we tried our best. Sorry but if you accidentally kill fifteen people, nobody cares what your intent was, it’s consequences that count. As soon as you have a child, you are going from “I didn’t ask to be here” to “I DEMAND people to be here.” You go from a place of “I didn’t choose any of this to happen” into “..but I’m okay with that.” You’re not supposed to get the personal benefits of having a child while ignoring all the hard work. You have the choice to do things differently, to do the right things even though they’re hard, etc. but you lose the “helpless” argument when you’re the one taking actions to perpetuate everything you say you’re against. I don’t have to respect hypocrites, and there’s a lot of them.
You perpetuate something, that means you get something from that called “responsibility,” and therefore you must be held accountable for your actions and their consequences like everyone else.
A lot of people want to say “I didn’t expect my gamble to be bad so it’s not my fault if it is.”
Yes it is, that’s just denying responsibility for the consequences of actions you could’ve prevented. Your choice to gamble in the first place was where you had the freedom of choice. It’s like saying “yes I stabbed you but it’s not my fault that your body bled to death. All the bleeding happened way after I stabbed you, not while I was doing it, that wasn’t me, I was only thinking about the knife and myself, like anyone else would do. You’re just entitled for ‘needing’ a blood transfusion. I bled out once and it wasn’t a big deal.”

This is a commonly misunderstood phrase that I believe means the opposite of what people interpret it to mean.
People think ‘blood’ means your family and that ‘water’ are extra-familial things like friendships, but this is not the case. The original phrasing is “the blood of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb.”
Meaning: the blood of the contracts we make for ourselves, the relationships we CHOOSE and decide are important for ourselves, regardless of how we happened upon them - there’s something MORE to that than the water of the womb, the connections that are there by default without any choice involved at all."

antinatalism,f9lhuyd,t1_f9kqjma,1575423470.0,"You’re implying that even if only 20% of people (for example) suffered a horribly grueling experience that traumatized them for life and led to them believing their lives weren’t worth living.. that because 80% disagree that that justifies continuing the horrible experiences of the 20%. I’ve heard this thought experiment taken to the extreme (I wish I could remember the name of this idea), like a utopia that is entirely based on and reliant on the sufferings of a single child. While everyone is in bliss in their communities, everyone takes turns spitting on this one child for the benefit of the entire society. When confronted, nobody seems to like it or even want to acknowledge it, but end up saying things like “it has to be done” or “that’s just how life is.” It (the child) has never seen love and cannot know what to do with it even if it did receive it. The point is that antinatalists are the kind of people that would refuse to justify that world and walk away from it, to some unknown place, because anything must be better than that world, they’re the people that would think this type of society was so sick that they had to leave because all the beauty in that universe couldn’t justify the brutal torture and exploitation, even if it was necessary, of a single individual.
I am reminded of the Anthropologist visiting African children story, where the anthropologists get the kids to play a competitive game trying to find a sack of fruit, winner takes all, and when the kids begin, instead of racing against each other they join hands and find the fruit together. When one finds it, he shares it with everyone else. When questioned why, the boy says “how could I ever be happy if everyone around me is miserable?” I feel like that mentality is missing from a lot of people. Most people, it seems, (at least where I live in US) couldn’t give two shits if their neighbors were being tortured as long as they themselves were alright. Antinatalists have a lot of trouble conveying the visceral negative feelings they have while bearing witness to this and it doesn’t compute to others with a different perspective. Natalists place more value on good things and are blind to suffering (because it’s justified on some level to them), and antinatalists place more value on preventing suffering and are hypersensitive to it.
I personally feel like positives can’t outweigh negatives because I used to think life would always be worth living because I “had logical reasons for existing.”
I think it’s interesting for you to mention you’ve experienced positives that are so good that they affect you for the rest of your life, in other words it sounds like reverse trauma! Unfortunately I haven’t had any experience that was THAT good, and positive things that previously justified my existence fell flat once I realized how low one can really go. I can’t conceive how being a rich man with every need met for the rest of my life could suddenly justify my trials and make me want to do it again and again to reach the same end goal. I didn’t know that developing severe depression, partly from living in a society that actively criminalizes healthy behavior, would make me second-guess and forget about everything I’d experienced prior. Suddenly good things don’t matter when you’re not getting your needs met anymore and you may remain this way until death. I never imagined being one of those people, but here I am. And yes, I have had many beautiful experiences and joy in my life, and it makes me profoundly sad to realize it just isn’t good enough because it can’t outweigh trauma. Being happy is always temporary to me but it seems traumas can follow one for life and affect everything one does.
On that note, you sound very callous with your reference to victims not “having to let something affect them forever” when it’s proven that this is a biological reality. I used to think this way before I was antinatalist and at the time I couldn’t conceive how someone would not be able to help themselves. I’d highly suggest looking into trauma and how it affects the brain, as it can explain some behaviors that are non-intuitive from the outside!
I am shocked to hear that some people seem immune to depression. I don’t know if I believe it but it certainly seems possible, and I think if that’s the case then those people are lucky and some people are just more sensitive and have a different experience.
Anyways, back to the birth thing. The interesting thing to AN is that people who want bio kids would ultimately rather take a gamble for a good thing instead of just doing stuff that guarantee good things 100% of the time. An unborn child can never be harmed and is therefore good as long as it remains unborn but to experience even a singular good thing in life one must suffer for it, some to a literally unbelievable degree. It’s like saying “Only 10% of people don’t like this movie but you have to watch it until the end because it’s the best movie you’ll ever see.” Can you not see the intuitive logic behind why anyone would think it’s better to end the film early or not watch it at all? “But you’ll never experience the best film of your life!” Just because the beginning was hella good and the near-end might be too doesn’t make me like the movie. End of story. I don’t understand natalists to understand the perspective just as I didn’t expect AN to find joy in the fact that other people are having fun. And don’t even get me started on the fact that life is inherently non-consensual. Maybe if euthanasia were legal we really couldn’t argue with natalists at all because they’d actually give people who disagree a way out, but that’s NOT what they’re interested in accommodating or solving at ALL, they’d rather prevent that option because slavery is preferable to living an intentional life with a way out just in case someone didn’t agree. Unfortunately I don’t think I’ve ever met a single natalist that could agree that this is slavery, as obvious and textbook-definition as it seems to me.

Not more anger! There are so many interesting responses here and the overall answer to this seems very complex. Obviously the socialization element seems to play a large role, and that’s a point I’d like to touch on, specifically the ways men and women articulate themselves emotionally.
It seems like the women are a lot more supportive of each other and more empathetic as a whole, they create a place where they can encourage each other and get away from the bullshit temporarily. The men tend to just get angry, and create a place where they can shout and just not be judged.. basically support in the only way they can? Many men in general feel that anger is more socially acceptable than any other kind of emotional expression. Hence, the overall rage, as this is what they are inoculated in, they seem far less likely to support each other via active listening to each other.. not that they are incapable of supporting each other through conversation because many do.. just that the overall atmosphere isn’t one of “you can go here and we’ll support you” but more like “you can go here and shout and scream and we don’t judge you for it.” Slightly different but that’s what I pick up on. I feel like for men, our idea of support is more like shouting in a room together.. a different (more restricted and superficial imo) kind of support. Sharing our pain and that’s kind of it.. that’s all men feel comfortable doing.. if we can’t hug at least we can scream together! perhaps why my close friends have almost exclusively been women.. fist bumps don’t do it for me sometimes haha

Another eye-opening thing I’ve discovered recently is that this hyper-masculine socialization (And subsequent homophobia and emotional stunting amongst men) wasn’t always the case. You can look back as far as the 1800s and find pictures of men holding each other, laughing and smiling like women do. It was after the commie scare and all this shit that incentivized men to refrain from emotional expression (except rage) and become emotionally stunted so they weren’t labeled homosexuals. I’ve even read accounts from Maasai men that were confused by the American mens’ lack of intimacy for example, it becomes more apparent with other cultural input. But more research is needed haha"

(which if you think about it, if self-sabotage is intentional it’s a choice, if it’s unintentional wouldn’t that be deserving of help or compassion?) Depressed man says everyone’s punishing me for being myself and society says no you’re punishing yourself (and somehow this means you deserve it)
My general feeling when I hear the idea that “the universe chose YOU...” is that of creating a poison so you can sell a cure and force the poisoned to work for you to alleviate the very symptoms you’ve given them."
depression,eyzzalo,t1_eyw5hdv,1567627289.0,"Bruh I’m the same way, I swear at this point in considering if I have some kind of mild aspergers or something because I’ve always felt like everyone else was given a memo on social interaction and I never got it, of course very little if any feedback lol.. probably you wouldn’t be able to tell just by talking to me because I’ve worked so hard to understand it so I’m a lot more emotionally intelligent and socially competent now, but only because I’ve meticulously analyzed it. Most people just intuit it and that’s what I think is different. I relate to all of what you said haha, like damn who doesn’t want to spend time with me when I’m willing to cook you a damn salmon or some shit, smoke you out whatever, and listen to your favorite music and shooting the shit? They’d rather got out and eat Arby’s LMAO I’m just a hermit now lol but I don’t mind it, I have one friend I’ll see occasionally but she’s a little far away. She’s been depressed longer than me and is one of the only people I feel understands me in that regard.. but also because she listens.
Now I’ve reached the point where instead of looking at the floor and avoiding eye contact constantly I have the balls to smile at literally anyone I want, constantly acknowledging anyone I see, and I can get almost every single person who sees me smile to smile back.. it’s crazy how slight body posturing can make people more likely to believe you’re telling your truth.. and also not..
I just think it’s funny that I grew up ‘socially awkward’ but I feel like I’m more socially conscious then most.. I think about people in ways that others don’t even notice.. I give room for people and try to make sure others with softer voices are heard. When others would interrupt to tell a story about themselves I’m thinking how rude of you to interrupt that person, do you really not even notice.. back to my main point, it seems to me like people who have social issues like that are more forgiving and understanding in general than NTs. I think because it’s harder for some people to understand social cues because they’re more ambiguous, they’re a lot more likely to be patient in trying to understand someone. They seem less likely to make assumptions and more likely to want to ask for clarification, probably because they are used to being misunderstood and don’t want others to feel that way. Anyway... thanks for sharing"
depression,eyzm4cq,t1_eyx9fyx,1567620818.0,"It affects everyone a little differently so I can’t recommend it for everyone because it’s not good for some people.. but for a lot of people and me personally it’s kept me going when I had nothing else and I’d probably be dead if it weren’t for weed so for me I love it and recommend anyone thinking about it to research it. If you have in state cultivation programs your options are even better, you can choose what ratio of cannabinoids you like (for depression they say higher cbd to thc is good, personally cbd has helped me a lot and I always add it now, you can even find low or no-thc hemp) and even consistently alter it slightly so it stays potent and feels different enough to keep working. I hear so much argument about what the best dosing schedule is, once a week was my thing for a long time but after getting depressed I switched to everyday, multiple times a day, and it keeps me going! I think, contrary to popular belief, that what determines if use isn’t beneficial isn’t the frequency (how often) of use but the overall picture of the substance’s influence. Is this thing creating more good than bad or vis versa? It’s the same justification they give for giving antidepressants to the suicidal - the benefits of this substance outweigh the negative side effects. And that’s what you would have to decide for yourself, if the positives of the plant can outweigh any negatives. Cost-benefit analysis! And for me I will continue to consume as long as I can, unless I can find something better (which I prob won’t with this ease of access haha)."

AskReddit,eyzaf55,t3_czhasg,1567613256.0,"It’s a couple things. Mainly my mom for the longest time, she’s been the only one that’s supported me from the very beginning. But also my music and art. I’m just trying to live long enough to work on these works of art that others enjoy and will enjoy after I’m gone. It’s so hard. So many will never understand how strong I am - the ridiculous pain I endure just to make these artworks for other people to enjoy. I suffer and do these things because I love people, and I will do it until I can’t take it anymore and die. I just don’t know how to live in this world anymore so the clock is ticking. I’m trying to stay grinding and get it all out before then. As much as I can. Because I want to return the favor, to every artist that’s helped me keep going through bullshit and inspired me when nothing else did. Art is just something I’ve always done and now I feel like it’s all I have left. If I can make one person feel like my fav artists have made me feel then I won’t feel like my life is worthless. Even if most people hated me as a person, doesn’t matter, someone out there doesn’t even know my name and is just listening, experiencing tangible things that originated in my brain and getting something out of it, that I could have let die within me, but haven’t due to my sheer strength and determination. It’s hard for me to picture that as a waste. All the years of working in a factory produced tangible work too but everyone forgets about it because while I’m helping produce food products for people, a robot could easily do it and will soon so my labor becomes a forgettable waste. If you don’t do it someone else will.
That’s literally it, aside from another recent recognized reason - pettiness. Everyone who’s ever told me I couldn’t do it, couldn’t be who I am, can’t make anything, can’t etc. I use that shit as fuel because it actually makes me mad enough to want to prove them wrong. Look at me now bitch!! I don’t even care about my own life and I’m still reaching for shit that I’ve decided is important to me, if I could live a life that I actually ENJOY living, that would be the most satisfying revenge I can think of. Thinking about this inherent strength makes me want to flex in response. Of all the reasons people have given me to give up, I just spit in their face! Most will never understand what people like us go through and that strength in and of itself is inspiring to me, I am more productive creatively than I’ve ever been despite still being depressed, and every time I can look back at the times I’ve given an articulated “fuck you” to all my ex friends who deserved it, I just smile and feel great! Because I spoke my truth and stood my ground and did what I said I would do and the fact that I’m still breathing means I’m ballsy enough to just be who I am, even if others don’t like it. Even if I’m horribly miserable and socially punished for it, at least I’m being authentically myself and taking my life head-on, I’m sensitive but no coward. Maybe that’s what it is - I’ve been told my whole life that I’m a coward but really I’m just sensitive. Now I think I’m one of the bravest people I know. I like talking about things that most people hide from and change the subject for example. It’s very hard for me to deny the truth, I feel like I can’t lie to myself, and I am very proud that I can maintain this sense of intellectual integrity."
depression,eyz5ln4,t3_czl1c5,1567610100.0,"Sertraline fucked me uuuuuup.. Okay I’m the first to say how many antidepressants have helped a lot of people, so I’m not discrediting then and saying they’re useless but the fact is that they aren’t ideal for a coin’s flip of people and can even worsen their issues. I think it’s worth a shot if you’re able of course, but I just can’t believe how sertraline made me feel. I was prescribed the lowest dose of it (sub-therapeutic) and it’s one of the most common. Very soon I was feeling terrible and I got bad akithisia. I wanted to literally rip my skin off it was so unbearable. And my limbs would involuntarily shake, and still do occasionally, since then. I even felt violent, as a pacifist type of person. By that I mean I was literally so agitated that I would have struck someone if they attempted to interfere with me at that moment. To me this is a shocking side effect of a drug, and I’ve taken a lot of fucked up shit before, I used to drink whole bottles of cough syrup and still I’ve never had a drug experience like I did with sertraline. I remember rocking on the floor at 4am thinking “these are symptoms of fucking meth withdrawal... wtf is wrong with me..” I felt obligated to constantly move or I would feel this literally agonizing uncontrollable urge to move (like restless leg syndrome but severe!!). Yeah so I was only on that for two days lol.. then I tried Effexor and had a completely different reaction. It was very tame, everyone said that was one of the hardest to get off of and had side effects, etc but it had almost no side effects on me. So I took that for around 7 months or so, probably longer, increasing the doses many times and even tried adding fluoxetine but that fluoxetine  didn’t work, didn’t feel like it did anything at all. Overall the Effexor helped but I was still depressed and still having crippling weekly episodes so to me I didn’t care if I seemed marginally “better,” if I still am not feeling any relief. I could still feel like crying for example but no tears would fall and when I felt myself spiraling downwards it was like the drug put up a gate in front of the spiral so I couldn’t go down any further, like it was blocking my descent into depression. But... I could still bang on the gate, pull on my chains and freak out anyway. That’s how I like to describe it.. that gate thing felt kinda cheap to me, like I’m not allowed to express certain emotions now? I felt more restrained than protected..
Getting better sleep probably would have helped just as much if not more, but the antidepressants I’ve taken have all messed up biological activities that keep me from being depressed in the first place. Terrible sleep? Now sleep worse! Boring sex life? Why even mstrb8? Have trouble eating your whole life? Feel even less hunger now! I stopped working out and took my first exercise hiatus, that I still struggle to continue. It started to do what every daily-use antidepressant I’ve ever taken has done - lose it’s effectiveness. So up the dose!!! That’s like the only advice I was ever given. Well even I know there’s a limit on how much you can take and if it stops working at the max then what then? Also I had two scrips for the same drug, different size caps, I needed both sizes every dose, and each ran out at a different time. Omfg! So many times I had to wait for insurance and psychiatrist to call each other and negotiate or whatever, or couldn’t get my meds in time and was fucked for days or a week. This whole process was so tremendously stressful to me that it’s literally easier for me to get some weed than have to deal with this shit. I can’t even miss my dose by 30 minutes and I’m fucked, I have to take it at the exact same time every day, schedule be damned. Every single tweak to the cocktail means waiting another couple weeks to see if it’s working. It began to control my life and schedule (I have to eat and exercise and plan everything around the time I take it) and the reason for my depression is that I feel like I don’t have any control over my life and I want some, so this was making it worse. Not to mention feeling guilty over the fucking bill!! (Which my parent helped me pay) So I quit Effexor cold turkey after missing my dose dealing with the pharmacy bullshit (not having my right dosage in time etc). Head-ringing for weeks. I was concerned when it lasted longer than I anticipated but eventually it went away and now I’m prescription-free.. I just self medicate now with cannabis and that’s the best I have for now (psilocybin works the best for me but I don’t have access to it). All the drugs I like that work and I can take as needed are all illegal. That’s why I like cannabis and psilocybin, (not to mention the absence of undesirable side effects and toxicity!!) I don’t have to take them every single day, so I can let the tolerance go down and they become more potent when I need them. These legal drugs I have to take every single day stop working. Any kind of persistent chemical disturbance is purely temporary in the face of biological equilibrium and homeostasis, and therefore isn’t ideal as a long term solution. That’s what I think. I could sit here and take drug after drug trying to find the ‘right one’ with the limited legal options but my patients (patience, hehe it’s a joke) has run out, I already know what works for me and society refuses to allow me it, so I’d rather have to go without until I can take my favorite (relatively harmless and nontoxic BTFW) drugs, than have to deal with the shitty legal ones that are hard to get and don’t do anything when they’re not making things worse. Not trying to discourage people from taking or trying them, just sharing my experience. Maybe if they actually worked for me I wouldn’t be so bitter, LOL"
philosophy,exjdije,t1_ex1h7p8,1566347711.0,"Thanks for sharing!! Holy shit my depression sounds like a stress disorder when you put it that way, also considering the fact that I have some seemingly atypical symptoms but it’s characterized by feeling paralyzingly exhausted. I’ll get ‘leaden paraysis’ a lot where I paradoxically want to and feel like I could move but physically I don’t move at all. I actually thought I was just stressed out for a long time and that I was just having a poor reaction to stressors and that when they were resolved I could heal and go back to normal functioning. Unfortunately that never happened, even when my environment changed. Since I have felt the described symptoms like slowed cognition and difficulty thinking and that’s been one thing that I feel like nobody understands is that my actual brain is functioning poorly than it did.. my memory is fucked while depressed and I literally feel incapable of even making the decision to text a simple one word message to someone. Because I’ve been chronically stressed for years this makes sense to me that this resulting severe difficulty functioning could potentially be better defined as a stress related disorder! And it’s particularly frustrating for me because I integrate everything I can think of to help myself into my life (healthy food, exercise, legal AD etc) and nothing has helped, I am a very sensitive and extremely ambitious person that sets relatively high standards for myself. I have a tendency to focus and work so hard on my work that I eventually burnout. The depression comes after feeling overwhelmed with the difficulty of my life, and the seeming futility of any achievements I make, because I feel no matter how much work and energy I expend I feel like I’m still losing. I think it’s learned helplessness resulting from overwork stress burnout. Thanks for listening lol and the information!!! <3"
antiwork,exhy95v,t1_eww7kl9,1566316943.0,"I think it’s interesting how men supporting women financially is seen as normal and even expected, admirable, whereas literally ANY form of a woman supporting a man, for any reason, is inherently evil and sexist because the lazy man is parasitizing the overworked woman. Depressed and about to kill yourself? You’re not allowed to have a woman help you! Help yourself, pussy! Man up! Woman doesn’t have to work? No problem, they agreed on it! To me this cultural assumption fits into the pro-work and natalist perspective.
I don’t know anyone that wouldn’t feel guilty living off of someone else’s income. Except a woman perhaps in a typical agreed-upon arrangement. I don’t know a man that wouldn’t feel guilty for some reason.

“Just because your partner is understanding or fine with something doesn’t make it right or fair” actually yes it does, that’s called CONSENT - consent totally makes things right and fair when parties can all agree to be on the same page, it should be between individuals, not individuals and society. Even in situations where a woman selflessly helps a man out as he struggles to get back on his feet, even when she enthusiastically encourages him, we all know by asking the man about his guilt deep down how society really feels - “you are a disgusting man that needs to rely on someone else? You’re worthless and selfish. You should be able to survive entirely by yourself as a social being without any assistance. If you can’t you're defective and deserve to die, parasite!” Yeah, bullshit. Every time a man is honest with his emotions and speaks his truth he is shut down and punished for it, emotionally stunting him because men are not socially allowed to express themselves without expecting disgust or fear - for love to be withdrawn.
Our worth, as women AND men, is not conditional upon our strength, appearance, or personal workload. I understand you probably have good intentions because surely there are people out there who don’t contribute enough in an abusive way, but most people provide value to each other in more ways than just being pack mules of monetary income. I try not to just make assumptions about internet strangers and furiously assume the worst instead of just asking them about things out of concern."

The feeling that there was a legit element of sheer practice was interesting, as it didn’t depend on more seemingly random variables in combat but literally how you used it. The physics system supported this idea, as all the weapons factor momentum and angle into the execution and make the factors of good play interesting to discover through experience. It took me quite a while to even start getting kills in multi, but the training made me more ruthless with my grinding. After years I finally got into story mode and I am impressed to a new level with this game. I think it is so well-made and the research and relative realism of it is very attractive to me.

Even the damn factory was more understanding than other jobs, it got to where I skipped half the days of work sometimes and they never fired me because I worked that fucking hard, I was so valuable to that company that they literally just begged me to show up and gave me hugs when I did. Felt very good at times like that, at least I’m not losing my job and they understand. That was a pocket sense of a community that I think we desperately need and are moving away from as a culture perhaps. Support, like when someone in the village is depressed every neighbor comes together with song and dance and they find them a new purpose and ensure they can reintegrate them into society. In the US you take potentially dangerous drugs that don’t work for half of all people to say the least, and you talk to people you can’t touch about bad things that have happened to you in a small room. I get it but for me it’s not enough, just makes me more poor and angry that there’s no legit way for me to feel better without losing more resources. Well eventually I couldn’t even keep that factory shit up. Restaurants have been far less forgiving. “You gotta come in if ur scheduled u kno” motherfucker I know that, but I’m not coming in some days because I’m throwing up and useless, so I just deserve to get fired and die then because I can’t 100% reliably come into any job anymore? And this is all my fault because any unemployed person is just lazy? How is anyone still working? Nobody’s allowed to get sick or have a fucking day to grieve a horrible tragedy? Because it was relatively fucking easy working in the factory feeling a false sense of security getting that big paycheck every week but I don’t understand how anyone can live like this because at the end of the day it’s not enough. We get sick and die, all of which is paid for. Most of our bills are for essentials and they bankrupt us. Most people work paycheck to paycheck in the us and I am appalled by that, how tf is that acceptable? I remember relating to forest dwellers in Indonesia I think (maybe wrong), they were saying “In the forest we had everything we needed. We had abundance and lived in harmony with nature. Now we only worry about money, and it is so hard to get. We struggle all the time now.”
I’ve worked my ass off and all I feel I’ve gotten for it is depressed, into a hole of despair that I’ve spent my life wary of and then used all my savings trying to get out of. Now it’s like I’m at rock bottom but somehow worse than when I started. I can’t climb up the ladder because all the bottom rungs are gone and I’m too broken to jump anymore. I have lost faith in the system of “work hard and you’ll do alright in life” because I’ve tried to do literally everything I could to build a live worth living and instead I feel like I’ve been not only spat at in my face, but society kicks me in the teeth while I’m down asking for help and says it’s not good enough. I feel I have done everything right and yet I am punished for excelling. I often feel like I have discovered to my horror that a machine-like matrix of self-justifying cultural lies has captured me and enslaved me as a pack mule, and I am forced against my will to conform, or to suffer as myself and die.
The truth is that I still work very hard even if our culture refuses to acknowledge it as real work. I for example compose lengthy complex songs, make paintings in many styles, all kinds of art and other tangible things that I know are valuable to people and I could even live off it if I suffered long enough to get the ball rolling.
I have decided that I will never work in the way these people want me to because I can never be anything other than what I am. I will suffer to do MY work. I think it is unreasonable to expect someone to cut off their edges to conform if it would destroy them. I think of the picture with the line of different animals in front of a tree with the monkey, standing next to the fish in a bowl. And the test for “fairness” is that everyone climbs the same tree. The monkeys are like fuck yeah and the fish obviously realize this is bullshit and unfair to them but this is a climber’s world and if they were ‘reasonable’ they’d adapt. Well if we’re honest with ourselves we know there are different measuring sticks for success and we can’t expect everyone to live exactly the same way. Everyone has strengths and weaknesses that are unique and benefit society in completely different ways and it would be cool if the system encouraged us to focus on our strengths like funneling into technical schools or whatever. (Rather than “if you can’t fly you’re fucked but you can only blame your own genetics.”)  Schooling especially should ideally function like a sorting system to help people find their best fit into society, rather than making everyone chase and worry about numbers and marks and that’s it. So much to talk about, hope this isn’t too disjointed or confusing to read. I relate to a lot and there’s so much to say."
depression,ewkgt17,t1_ewk57t4,1565484013.0,"That lifestyle doesn’t work to me and everyone frame it down my throat like I’M being the unreasonable one. I once heard a quote and I’ll never forget it: “All societal progress is made by unreasonable men. Reasonable men do not change anything, they adapt themselves to their environment and don’t stir the pot. Unreasonable people demand change, they cannot live in the way they do, they say “NO, this isn’t good enough!” The people who change society are always seen as unreasonable by everyone else. Because they haven’t realized the unreasonable man’s point that, no, everyone else is being unreasonable to me!!"
depression,ewkgjeq,t1_ewk14iu,1565483804.0,"DUUUDE my body could’ve written that.. and yeah I feel like all I do is give.. and I’ve given until I’ve become too depressed to give any more but now I’m bitter because I feel like no one can help me with my needs, everyone just takes and doesn’t give in return. I think, ‘where is the reward.. any reward..’ I used to not care that much but eventually when you can’t get your needs met it’s all you think about"
depression,ewkgai2,t1_ewjygvv,1565483617.0,"I’m not okay with it either! People say “life isn’t fair” and that doesn’t sound like any solution to me, so many people justify their own behavior regardless of whether or not it is good consequentially. I think of the picture with 3 big fish, big one about to eat medium about to eat the small one, and the small fish says “life sucks” medium says “life is fair” and big fish says “life is good”.. like many people absolutely refuse to acknowledge that life could be anything other than beautiful, because the good ALWAYS outweighs every struggle for power. Many people would rather keep a suffering person in their life longer than honor their wishes and let them go.. anyways a big part I’m stuck on with most people is “the truth.” Like how we claim to love truth as a society but don’t follow it into uncomfortable places because our personal feelings and impulses so often take priority over what we really think is right. I am ashamed that speaking out about the truth of what one feels is met with disgust and avoidance by so many people. I don’t understand how most people can be honest with themselves and have a legitimate sense of integrity with all these things, juggling these paradoxical ideas. Like how you’re ultimately expected to do literally almost everything by yourself as an individual and you have to make it on your own, while simultaneously pretending like you’re NOT a social animal that NEEDS other people to thrive. As much of an introverted hermit as I am, I still need other people occasionally and it is very painful to think that I can’t really admit I need people without being met with some kind of disgust."
depression,ewk7uyd,t3_cokwbl,1565477765.0,"The only reason I can maintain a caloric surplus is because of cannabis basically.. when I run out or go on vacation I lose like 10 lb easy. It’s great for me but I can’t recommend it for everyone. Other than that I’ve had trouble eating basically my whole life so aside from that, one method is taking small sips of water with food. My body hardly produces saliva when I’m not hungry so this makes it easier to chew and eat. Another method I’ve discovered recently is capsaicin peppers! Lol I’ll eat some ghost peppers and my mouth will salivate for hours. Once again, can’t recommend that for everyone, but maybe if you’re into spicy/pungent food in general, foods that really stimulate saliva production could help. Hot peppers to garlic, onions, etc. I try to make most of my own meals so when I do I’ll add a shit ton of seasonings and I’ve gotten more into cooking to figure out what flavors I like. This helps me make my food taste WAY better and make me want to eat it more. When I have no energy or otherwise can’t make food I have things that are easy to eat, like pho or ramen noodle things, anything preservable that I can keep for a while and doesn’t rot quickly. Even chips and salsa! This is helpful because I won’t eat for so long that I’ll lose energy and feel like I can barely move, so having quick microwave shit or bagged lentil crisps etc can kickstart me preparing food. In general I try to limit big sugar all at once unless I have fiber with it so it doesn’t make me sick, but even ‘junk food’ can give me enough energy to make a ‘proper’ meal feel doable. Even fruits like blueberries, apples, bananas, etc are super easy to eat and give you some energy, even veggies like carrots, etc. You could even prep your meals when you do cook so that you have a bunch of containers of ready-to-be-heated-up food that takes minimal effort to eat. I’ll make pasta dishes (with the whole box of pasta at a time), combining a lb of each ingredient basically so I can scoop it out over the course of days whenever I want to microwave some. You could even freeze leftovers before it goes bad and save it for months.."
