depression,fq8qdzt,t1_fq6l528,1589172628.0,"I’ve noticed recently that new things scare me a lot, and the uncertainty of what might happen, so I assume the worst. I can’t really put into words why this scared me but part of the reason is because we’ve never owned a pet and I’ve gotten so used to the idea that we’re not a pet family per se, or that it will be too difficult to take care of him and that I won’t like the experience in general. This sounds kinda stupid lol"
depression,fq8bltj,t1_fq6y97k,1589162525.0,"Thanks for this. Nice to know I’m not the only one. Idek what I’m scared about, but ig it’s that new things scare me in general and this is a really big new thing.

I think that we’re going to waitstaff least a week or two until deciding if we want to keep him. Do you think that’s a good idea?"

So of course I like the cat and it’s cute and all, but I’m just scared of the long term commitment. I think I’m anxious about all new things. Idk if the amount I worry is normal or not because I haven’t actually been diagnosed with anxiety (idk why psychologist doesn’t want do diagnose me with anything). I’m starting to warm up to the cat, but as I said, the long term commitment is still really scary. Sorry of none of this makes sense idk how to write it in a way to get everything lol"

But you waited. You waited for years. He never came back or called, so you grew up to resent him. He dies many years later, and grow even angrier since he died before ever apologizing. You’re invited to the funeral. You don’t go. You are then blamed for being resentful and holding grudges which causes you to quit your desk job you’ve had for 13 years, and become a supervillain to punish those who wronged you, and more. 5 years later you come across a man who knew your father. Turns out he ingested contaminated milk and gained the power of super strength. Your father knew what he had to do; and so he set out to stop all those who tried to do bad in the world. He ended up dying of toe cancer; probably from the milk he ingested so many years prior. After learning this, you realize that all your anger and hate was pointless so instead of using your powers for evil, you go back to your desk job then kill your self. The end."
