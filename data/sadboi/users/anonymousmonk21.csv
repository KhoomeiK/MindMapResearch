SuicideWatch,ewswiuh,t3_cq0d71,1565736845.0,"I don‚Äôt know why but when I seek therapy I feel weak. It‚Äôs stupid I know, but I guess it has something to do with my ego. I‚Äôve always hated getting helped by others. I‚Äôve always liked to do things myself if that makes sense. But I should really drop this and see therapy as a way of opening up and asking for help because I deeply need it"
SuicideWatch,ewswd2s,t3_cq0d71,1565736736.0,"
Hey, I‚Äôve opened up about my parents with anxiety, so I got put on meds. I had a therapist, but I had a difficult time opening up and being completely honest, I wasn‚Äôt honest at all I even lied about a couple things.. I took therapy as a joke. I completely regret it. If I mention therapy again to my parents, they‚Äôll just complain because it‚Äôs a long process to get a therapist in the first place and my parents are always busy for the most part. 

And I threw it away telling them ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need it‚Äù when I now clearly do."
SuicideWatch,ewsmkzy,t3_cpy8al,1565730663.0,"I myself am suicidal as well, but when I‚Äôm in a really tuff spot I think of the people who love me. My mom, friends, family. How selfish would it be to just go without telling them nothing. If you‚Äôre suicidal don‚Äôt kill yourself for them. All I wish others to know is, it is not the cowards‚Äô way out, and no one will ever understand a person‚Äôs mind when it is attempted. How terrible it actually is to feel that way. You don‚Äôt think of your kids, or your family, you just want to leave this world."
