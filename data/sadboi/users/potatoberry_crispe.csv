raisedbynarcissists,fp41fjy,t3_gb6x7u,1588289805.0,"this makes me so sad. i hope you can move out as soon as you can, i promise your life will be happier. 

it’s normal in the sense that you’re reacting to abuse. people react differently. a lot of the time i deal with conflict by arguing back intensely and others i’m completely silent. 

i hope things get better for you soon."

i might adopt a cat this weekend and i was just thinking about how i'm going to give her all of the attention and love she needs. it's obvious you did that for ur girl, even if she wasn't a fan of the puppy, she clearly loved you very much."

BPD,fi5wxg2,t3_f6nfst,1582172470.0,I agree with all of this. Try to separate urself from anything that triggers you into feeling inferior and start vibing with as much good as you can. I’m having a horrible shitty few months because I did something bad and I’ve been at the point of wanting to kill myself but I’ve been trying so hard and I’m pulling through and have support

relationship_advice,f9vj2uo,t3_e75oec,1575671715.0,"Why does it matter if you get married before 30? Also you still have 4 yrs and that’s a lot of time so you could get married if you really wanted to. People show their best side on social media so I doubt that everything is as perfect as you perceive it to be. 

Personally; getting married before 35 seems like a nightmare to me"
