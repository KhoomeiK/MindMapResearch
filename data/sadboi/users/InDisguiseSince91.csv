tretinoin,fnh93oh,t3_fy90et,1586957740.0,Did you purge at all? How bad was it and how long did it last? Your skin is pure goals.
SkincareAddiction,fnfvodx,t1_fnfj1g4,1586916456.0,Haha that‚Äôs awesome to hear!!! Guess I‚Äôm picking it up tomorrow. Right now the copay is $0. Only ‚Äúfree‚Äù thing available to me right now lol. I just figured with it balancing your hormones and all it could cause a breakout. But like I said I‚Äôve been on spiro so I feel like that would help. It‚Äôs nice to hear you recommend it because it‚Äôs reassuring!
SkincareAddiction,fnfh42t,t1_fm23kmt,1586907932.0,Did you experience any purging or increase in breakouts with Yaz? I‚Äôve been on spiro and it‚Äôs worked great but now they want to use Yaz too and I‚Äôm scared I‚Äôm going to get a big breakout again!
SkincareAddiction,fnfe3cu,t3_f7an2i,1586906308.0,Did you experience purging from tax or increased breakouts when first starting it before the spirit worked it‚Äôs magic? I‚Äôm on spiro now and still getting hormonal acne so they want to add Yaz to the mix now. I‚Äôm scared of breaking out all over after making so much progress with spiro. I wonder if it will be less of a breakout because I‚Äôve already been on a hormone regulating medicine.
