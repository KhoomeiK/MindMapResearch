FantasyVisionContests,fr2k4tn,t3_gmane5,1589838702.0,"I’m not a participant, but I was thinking about this for some countries in the final that don’t have the capacity. Obviously this is up to the hosts, but these are just ideas.

Liechtenstein does not possess an indoor venue of any kind, while the nearby Swiss cities of Chur and Davos both have 7,000 seat hockey arenas that can be doubled in capacity for concerts. Personally, I nominate  the 15,000 seat **Hanns-Martin-Schleyer-Halle in Stuttgart, Germany**. Liechtenstein’s representative is German and a Big 5 host would prevent any ill will towards the notion that Switzerland would need to qualify for its own final.

Luxembourg’s only indoor arena only has a capacity of 8,000 and, since it’s primarily used for basketball, can’t be expanded. You could use it since there isn’t a bigger arena for a while around, but my choice is the 12,000 seat **Zénith de Strasbourg in France**. Although it isn’t in Strasbourg proper, and its a few hundred kilometres from Luxembourg, I associate it with the European identity more than any other city, just as I associate Luxembourg with such an identity more than any other country. Also, Eurovision in a theatre would be pretty damn cool.

For San Marino, I suggest the 13,000 seat **Adriatic Arena in Pesaro, Italy**, less than 30 km from Marinian border.

For Andorra, anywhere in Catalonia should be fine as they share a language and similar culture. Plus Spain will be hosting, so there’s another case where a Big 5 hosts with no conflict of interest. The country’s largest indoor arena - and the probable host should Spain win Eurovision in real life - is the 17,000 seat **Palau Sant Jordi in Barcelona**.

A country people might not know has a large arena is Malta. It doesn’t have a Wikipedia page, but the village of Ta’Qali, near Rabat, has [a venue that can fit 13,000 seated and 25,000 standing](https://www.mfcc.com.mt/venue). Celine Dion was due to play there this Summer."
