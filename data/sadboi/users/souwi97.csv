selfimprovement,fqvgwuo,t1_fqve468,1589677017.0,"i haven't really thought about how we are all gonna be passionate about the same subject lol. i had a really bad undergrad experience so i think that's also the reason why i'm so very anxious about college. aw thanks! i will keep you updated, thanks for your words"
selfimprovement,fqvge70,t1_fqvfl0f,1589676711.0,"that sounds a lot like me, it's very hard to put yourself out there again. what made me change my mind about staying the same, is that i found my journal. While reading this journal from 2016 it occurred to me how I have been stuck in the same place for a couple of years now, that realization shook me. ofcourse i knew in the back of my mind, but to face reality like this was actually eye opening. someone had posted on this post ""don't let uncertainty become an excuse of giving anything less than your absolute 100%"" and i think that's a quote that could inspire you. sorry to hear you're going through pain."
selfimprovement,fqvfujq,t1_fqve72z,1589676380.0,"that's so awesome and admirable you are starting a completely new career. are you anxious about it? how'd you find out where your passion lays? 
wow yes. ""As long as you don't let uncertainty become an excuse for giving anything but your absolute 100%"" is so spot on, for two years uncertainly was my excuse to not challenge myself! i was unhappy with my job and I didn't experience any fulfillment from the work i did, yet i stayed in this mindset because of my excuse. so it was a very suffocating feeling to be stuck in the same place while unhappy but the only thing holding me back is my own mind. thanks for these words and goodluck with your new career"

I just can't help but compare myself to peers, or people of my age that had the perfect timeline for their successes. Yeah I'm making it into a big deal into my head too, I keep thinking about it. I guess I have to find a way to not bother my mind with negative thoughts so much. And appreciate my individualism, thank you for your reply:) It does help hearing these words from other people."

I have a check up with my surgeon on december, should I wait it out?"
PlasticSurgery,f556x3k,t3_dmluab,1572001437.0,"TBH... It's so minor, that you shouldn't bother changing it. It doesn't make your face look any different. IMO you're beautiful with your current nose and I think that undergoing surgery for such a minor detail wouldn't be the best decision. You have a perfect side profile. It suits your features, you have big eyes(Saw the picture you posted below). And your eyes are what one would look at first. Nose is fine. But if you think it'll make you more confident, you should do it. But think about it really really well. I've had a nose job at 17 yrs old and revision after, currently happy, BUT I honestly (now as 22 year old) would have never undergo rhinoplasty. Best of luck & hope you find happiness in your decision xoxo"

PlasticSurgery,f3yamcf,t1_f3y73u3,1571251113.0,"IDK then.... I have a check up in december but this surgeon is pretty notorious for being nonchalant and dissmissive to the patients who tell him that the nose does not look like what he promised it would look like l... I wonder if one of those nose shots will help at all.. In june when I told him that one side was super swollen (went down) he literally told me ""Having a perfect nose is impossible"" while my nose is already far from perfect"
PlasticSurgery,f3y65pa,t1_f3y5jst,1571249186.0,It's subtle but it just looks so weird especially from a 45 angle. I just don't know if it's because of swelling or because the surgeon fucked the revision up. My nose is way better than it looked but I literally specifucally told him I wanted a kinda upturned nose.

I can totally sympathize with how horrible you felt and how no one was taking you serious.... I'm happy that the surgeries have fixed some symptoms, but sad to hear not all of them were fixed for you. On the websites(In dutch) it doesn't state anywhere this could be deadly... I'll pray for you, may you have a safe surgery and may you be cured entirely.
I honestly hope my little broter does not have chari... :( I just wish they would take him seriously... At least your messages put a lot of things in perspective for me and wakes me up in a way, i don't want to doubt him anymore, Monday can't come fast enough... I hope we can talk to eachother on this post still. I will let you know if it's indeed Chari. Thanks so much for your help and input. Sending light your way. ❤️"

PlasticSurgery,eqr6ynp,t1_eqqdrwo,1560251154.0,"Hey, sorry I don't know if I'm allowed to do this but I wanted to give a response on 1.
I've had surgery and I'm a bit over 3 months post-op. No ONE has noticed anything! I had a big hump, still literally not one person has noticed it... Not even my friends. To be honest, no one will think that you've had a nosejob overnight. Everyone did tell me ""Hey you look so different! What did you do?"" And start looking at make up, or whatever. I also did lash extensions so that's actually where everyone focused on lol. It was a little trick. But my surgeon even told me that no one will think you had one, nowadays the more natural look and finding a nose that fits with the facial features is trendy. Getting a small, tiny button nose (still beautiful if it fits your face) would definitely draw attention I think."
PlasticSurgery,eqr6s36,t3_bz64tf,1560250927.0,Were you ever dissatisfied with your nose? When did you start liking it?

Do you sleep on your side?
