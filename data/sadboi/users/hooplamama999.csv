BipolarReddit,fqd6sfo,t3_gi3405,1589281684.0,"I'm 22 and the only good dream I've ever had was me holding a happy chubby baby for 30 seconds (despite us being in the middle of a battlezone), every other dream I have had has just been a string of intense nightmares, some that I'm used to while others leave me haunted and crying for days. I have Bipolar 1 & PTSD that was just retriggered back into full force from my last hospitalization due to recent trauma and its been coming out insanely heavily in my dreams. It also doesn't help that I often believe my dreams mean something and that something bad is going to happen (deadass I have premonitions but of course once you say that to a doc they test you for schizophrenia, but seriously I have them). They prescribed me a medication recently to stop the nightmares but since I really believe that they are messages for me, both from my subconscious and the universe, I'm refusing to take them because why would I want to alter the meaning of these messages?"

bipolar,fkji8e6,t3_fireub,1584246719.0,Honestly I get manic tattoos about shit that happened to me during my depressions. I’m a social work student and have often debated the therapeutic aspect of tattoos with my professors because they see it as an alternative to self harm but I think it can be a beautiful coping mechanism that allows YOU to write your history in images and words even its on your skin. Your therapists might disagree but honestly there’s worst things you can do to yourself
BipolarSOs,fkhwrc7,t1_fkhtqiv,1584207420.0,"*trigger warning* I’m away from him now but was just hospitalized bc the ending kind of lead to a break down for me. He was incredibly abusive and we went to a party and he let a group of men sexually assault me while I was drunk out of my mind. He messaged me one day saying “I love you so much, if I didn’t talk to you I’d kill my parents and rape my mom” so I was weirdly scared to leave him thinking about what he would do to other people and that I was the only one tough enough to handle his shit because I thought I was just as fucked up as him. I still have flashbacks to that assault every day multiple times a day and I’ve been rapid cycling more because of it. I also found out recently that he was cheating on me the whole time and gave me clamydia and I’ve had it so long now that I might have PID, I never thought to get checked because I thought we were in a monogamous relationship. I literally want to smash his car and he lives right down the road. And this is weird but bc everyone’s bugging about coronavirus it feels like the literal world had been ending with me in 2020 😂"
ptsd,fkhsr5y,t3_fidd00,1584205289.0,"Freeze and Fawn are also common reactions to dangerous situations but we don’t focus on them as much because a lot of studies are based on the experiences and perceptions of men. I’ve been assault twice now and I realize I fawn and then freeze when I feel in danger. Once I realize I can’t just act nice enough to get out of the situation I freeze. Women tend to be fawners more then fighters because that’s the way society has taught us. I had no idea this was a thing until recently which makes a lot of sense because I remember my dad asking “what do you do if a strange man attacks you” and my response was “tickle them a lot to throw them off guard, hug them and say it’ll be ok and maybe we can talk it out after I give them all my money” I SERIOUSLY THOUGHT THIS WOULD WORK LOL so my dad got me mase and a self defense book instead"

That’s supposed to be comforting, at least it is to me 😂😭I’m glad I can feel both extremes rather then just depression. Sorry this is getting off topic haha"

Lol jk but coke is the one drug I’d HIGHLY RECOMMEND STAYING AWAY FROM. Especially with bipolar, I’ve done it during a manic episode and it made shit spiral worse after only one night of doing it. It can make you feel better for like 30 mins in my experience but it’s really not worth a life time addiction. So many of my family members with bipolar turned to coke for comfort and it was NOT PRETTY"

I think dabbling in different activities until you find one that sticks is worth it, and even if they don’t stick at least you have new experiences. I highly doubt you’re boring, honestly idk if this is problematic but idk how someone with bipolar could be boring. We pop off at least once a year with the mania/hypo"

I also become delusional quiet frequently and I remember at 17 thinking I was legitimately going to run for President, began writing speeches and everything, everyone just blew me off as “cute” for some reason bc I’m a girl. That was my first unmedicated manic episode and then halfway through I decided to switch my major to Russian and learn the language in order to overthrow the government. Then when I moved into my new dorm I was convinced that a boy in there was sending spies to come find me and kick me out so I locked myself in my room and began throwing up. This went on for weeks and I also wasn’t hospitalized"

I actually ended up being hospitalized a few days later because of it. The only advice I can offer is to take off from work potentially and if it gets too bad go to the hospital and explained what happened and your withdrawal symptoms and they should be able to help with something."
BipolarReddit,fjy3k98,t3_ffcrn4,1583689125.0,"*potential trigger* every time during spring for the past five years I’ve written suicide letters and have been hospitalized for attempts. I didn’t realize this until during my last hospitalization I read through my journal entries from the past 5 years and saw a very clear pattern. For me it presents much more as a rapid cycling mixed episode where I wake up in the morning laughing my ass off (literally it’s like I woke up on meth) and then by the end of the day I’m sobbing, banging my head against the walls and trying to rip my hair out. My psychiatrist said there’s a lot of research out there regarding how seasonal bipolar is and how some people with are are just very intune with nature basically. I also think it’s interesting that April is suicide awareness month and I wonder if there’s a correlation between the two. Last time I went to the hospital in April they said spring is always the worst time for inpatient mental health settings.

Has anyone ever experienced this? I was manic all winter, then dipped into a severe mixed episode and now I’m wondering if I’m going to be depressed this summer or if I’ll just turn manic again..... 

Sorry for the rant but I’ve been thinking a lot about this"
BipolarReddit,fjy2rrm,t1_fjxon80,1583688666.0,This is actually a super interesting comment that I’ve been wondering about... if you live in a geographic region that doesn’t go through drastic season changes will you have an easier time during spring????

I thought that maybe he was bipolar bc he kept saying how similar we sounded and that we were both emotional and cry easy. Two girls were murdered on our campus by their boyfriends and he made a comment on it and was like “it’s crazy the things people do for love”. THATS NOT LOVE WTF?! AND IM THE WEIRD ONE HERE?! I’m used to non emotional men so I thought it’d be nice to have a guy more in touch with his emotions but there were some red flags. My ex said the same thing about those murders and he ended up being the most abusive piece of shit ever. And again I was the one labeled crazy after that just because I have a diagnosis
BipolarReddit,fju16dp,t1_fjtse4y,1583612597.0,I kept telling this dude “hey I’m just really direct because I’m a Sagittarius so can you be direct with me too” bc tbh he was giving way too many mixed signals for me. He asked me what I took medication for and instead of lying I told the truth bc I figured if we worked out he’d find out anyway and it’s better not to lie. I’ve also met up with girls and my classmates have “warned” me that they’re also bipolar and I’m like..... lol so am I.... so what are you saying?

I'm paying too much for school to just stop and get hospitalized while my loans accumulate debt. The sooner I'm done with my degree the sooner I can have the money & comfort to take care of myself. Its ironic bc I""m a social work student and the more I obsess and learn about the disorder the more I just want to say fuck it all and never take shit again.

I see what you mean but I think for me this was largely triggered by PTSD because I very recently got out of the worst relationship in my life where I had a gang assault happen very close the to anniversary (I’m not sure what other word to call it bc that sounds weirdly positive) of my first boyfriend do something similar to me in college. I cannot stand men at this point using my own sanity against me. I’ve been gaslit so many times because of it that I know what it looks like. I’ve written academic papers for my social work program on it apply it to my life. I understand there’s probably instances that I’ve been manic and gaslighting but since I’ve had it done so much to me I’m very aware not to do it to others and this is an instance where I am being gaslit, not the other way around.

BipolarReddit,fibvc3p,t1_fiaqumk,1582330995.0,"I’m going to stay at my friends tonight bc I really can’t be here right now because this house is straight up toxic. I’m in a lease that’s up in three months so I was thinking of just waiting it out until I move. When I don’t clean up then I get bombarded with texts or there’s just tension in the house. Im also a clean person so I think it’s unfair for ppl to tell me to just “stop cleaning” bc then the house would be a disgusting disaster and I’d absolutely become depressed. I’ve tried addressing this so many times with house meetings, texts and conversations but eventually got annoyed addressing it all the time. And I only live with this one particular person bc I’m friends with everyone else in the house (there’s an upstairs too). I don’t mind cleaning generally but not when I’m being pushed to do it while everyone else just sits back. I frequently make house dinners too and I feel like I’m a generally hospitable roommate until I’m disrespected repeatedly. And whenever I slip up and leave my dishes in the sink for a day (has happened 2 times this past year and we have a dishwasher so...)  I always get called out for it which is annoying bc if I called him out constantly it would be annoying and I’d be called a bitch

***I’m also generally open about my mental health and even have an insta art page for having bipolar which is fun. I’m also a grad student in social work so I think being open about mental illness is really important to break stigma but what I find happens to me often is I get these abusive men that play into the fact that I’m in a helping profession like that and then it becomes this weird caring codependent situation. Getting into abusive relationships is a slow process of manipulation so it drives me a little crazy when people say “Pick different men!” Bc some of these are men that LIED about every aspect of their background to me bc they’re so insecure. I know some people are good at it but I have not gained the skills yet of becoming a walking lie detector haha"

You do get your opinion but why are you so up in arms right now? You’ve probably been called a gaslighter so you did some half baked research on the topic to justify yourself.
