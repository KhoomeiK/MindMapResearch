Stumbling around drunk

I just didn‚Äôt feel ready to rehash everything with someone new, yet, so I cancelled. I‚Äôve cancelled 2 different ones this week and now I‚Äôm trying figure out what next. But I will go back again. Best wishes OP; you got this!"

Mustang,f3anjql,t1_f3aepp6,1570781911.0,"I‚Äôm sorry; beautiful car. I hope you are ok, though.  Lost my dream car last year in an accident and it took a while to get over."
ptsd,f38ympb,t3_dfzcnv,1570741560.0,"Congrats! I was given a leave today and spent a few hours setting up doctors appointments, too. I‚Äôve been a shaking crying mess for weeks and I just finally can‚Äôt take it. I am terrified but know this will work! Best wishes!"

offmychest,ezb70he,t3_d0fhv4,1567814373.0,My grandmother would sew in useful pockets into her pants decades ago. I guess I‚Äôm still a rebel and want the same. I even like them hidden in skirts and dresses...

declutter,ewh0wma,t1_ewgmgo6,1565395088.0,I‚Äôm in your situation as well. I purged and organized my kitchen but have some rather expensive kitchen appliances that I don‚Äôt want but hate spending time selling. There are a few consignment and pawn shops I was thinking of visiting but not getting my hopes up.  The only items I‚Äôve thrown out have been broken and unusable items.

Mustang,ewb2hs7,t3_cnekf3,1565257650.0,Happened to me last year in my vert as well. The driver even told the cop the he never even saw the race red vert. I settled and now I wish I sued. Still dealing with residual issues. Glad you are both ok!
Mustang,etv3jg8,t3_cdh5py,1563225575.0,"Congrats!! I had a ‚Äò15 ecoboost with the performance upgrade and loved it! Upgraded to a  ‚Äò16 GT recently and hands down, the GT is amazing."
