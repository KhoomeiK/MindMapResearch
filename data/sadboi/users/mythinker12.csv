MAOIs,fkbrgc1,t3_fh6j76,1584038441.0,Nurse here. Verify whether this effect happens to some extent from either alone.  Parnate can do stuff like this on acute administration.  Alpha agonism may cause hypotension.  Most likely the culprit is your heart rate.  Blood pressure drops in response to elevated rate as a compensatory mechanism to maintain a constant cardiac output.  This is a potentially dangerous blood pressure.  You may wish to consult your provider.  Continue to monitor your blood pressure and HR vigilantly if you wish to continue this combination.

depressionregimens,fekt50c,t3_epkzsj,1579207061.0,Slowly taper mirtazipine first.  Very slowly.  Don’t ween both at the same time.  I suspect mirtazapine is responsible for most of your negative side effects anyways.  Venlafaxine can cause real problems upon discontinuation.  Make sure you have renormalized from discontinuing mirtazapine before you slowly taper off the venlafaxine.  I’ll be honest you might be in for a hard thing.

And 85 while laying down is totally normal.  Arrhythmias are common and go away on their own.  Even if op got an ekg, all medical staff would do is watch until he renormalizes."

depressionregimens,fbiprkr,t1_fbimqp8,1576909059.0,For the first few months I didn’t sleep very much.  But I wasn’t depressed.... just stick with it
depressionregimens,fbid9hq,t3_ediu4a,1576897675.0,"Yes.  It was helpful in general but it didn’t stop that intense need to take a nap.  I actually took parnate in the evening for a while and timed it so that “crash” would coincide with sleeping hours.  Sorta worked.

I’m not sure I ever got over that daytime sleepiness thing with parnate. I just played with split doses and timing and just dealt with it.

Small amounts of phenylalanine might be helpful but be careful.  Also... you can take smaller doses of pretty much any stimulant.  Too bad your doc won’t explore that with you."
depressionregimens,f8q8mmb,t3_e1kbbc,1574713820.0,You should drop the dosage again.  Dosage changes the dynamics.
depressionregimens,f3trqya,t3_di6wv5,1571144387.0,Bupropion and Parnate.  You want to avoid anticholinergics.  TCAs are great antidepressants but may be inferior in this regard.  Best to find effective antidepressant and request augmentation with something like modafinil.
