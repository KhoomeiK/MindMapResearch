mentalhealth,fkyohs1,t3_flfaa0,1584652859.0,Does this work in Canada?
waterloo,fgy7g02,t1_fgy726j,1581180284.0,Thanks! Yah I noticed that
waterloo,fguk47v,t1_fguk1gu,1581122796.0,Is it part of the college itself? Can I find info on their website?
DID,eu9dfib,t1_eu3czlw,1563577649.0,Right???? I never know what’s around the next corner
DID,eu9ddmo,t3_cejcs3,1563577610.0,Thanks! Definitely leaning towards sticking with what I’ve got
DID,eu9dc4s,t1_eu3tvjg,1563577579.0,Yah we definitely need to weigh the pros and cons because if it’s going to upset us too much I don’t think it’s worth it
DID,eu9d9uo,t1_eu5zuwb,1563577533.0,Wow thank you! That gives me a lot of insight it’s also nice to know that going to this therapist isn’t my only option. I’ve been talking to my partner and we think if it freaks out the younger parts too much it’s not worth it. Plus if we don’t like this new therapist cause she’s cold a few of my alters will sabotage the process anyways. Thanks so much for taking the tome to respond
DID,eu3ap27,t1_eu3akhc,1563409700.0,So this has been my fourth dbt therapist that I’ve tried. And she’s the first that knows about DID and trauma. I’m also waiting to hear from my current therapist after she consults with her. I haven’t 100% committed to this yet.
DID,eu3a4v9,t1_eu36c28,1563409286.0,I didn’t know you could outgrow BPD... your program sounds very different. Congrats on the years without self harm or injury I hope to be there one day
DID,eu39zag,t1_eu38p8e,1563409171.0,Wow thank you for the perspective and info! The dbt is for my borderline personality diagnosis. And my T and Psychiatrist are hoping that it will help manage some of those symptoms
DID,eu35mx5,t1_eu30on5,1563405988.0,"Honestly I’m really new to DBT as well. Apparently it’s one of the rules of DBT is that you can’t have an outside therapist because they don’t want conflicts.
I don’t fully understand the rule but every DbT therapist I’ve spoken to has said the same thing."
DID,eu35imp,t1_eu32rt4,1563405902.0,"Yes she is, however my current therapist is consulting with her to make sure she fully understands. When I spoke to her she was very knowledgeable of DID but also very cold so I can’t see any of my parts liking her or trusting her right away. It’s definitely going to take some time. But the good news is it is only for the 5 month program then I can go back to my regular therapist."
DID,eu35d1c,t1_eu318yd,1563405792.0,Yah I think it’s just going to take a lot of reassurance because the fear of abandonment is strong and that’s part of the BPD so hopefully DBT is supposed to help with that. But none of this will work if we don’t like the person or trust them. Yah my younger parts pretty much see my therapist as a mother so it’s going to be tough.
DID,eu30ng9,t1_eu30jha,1563402506.0,Thanks so much for replying. It will most likely happen that we will have to take the 5 month pause but my therapist has promised us that she will prepare us before that and that she will be here for us when we’re back but it still hurts
waterloo,eu2vyf2,t1_etwkv7v,1563399362.0,sure right now cause its the summer I'm free most days! Just let me know and I'll see if I can make it
waterloo,etviml4,t3_cdk72p,1563236373.0,I would also love to!
DID,ersea5s,t1_erse993,1561211351.0,Hahahaha!!! Or smelly markers for me!!
DID,err7a9d,t1_err72vp,1561162286.0,"Thanks! I hadn’t been looking at it seriously, I just wanted more information so thank you for that! I don’t want to create false memories of bad events I have enough real bad events I have to work through lol I sure as hell don’t need more! Thanks again!"
DID,eq8f1b8,t1_eq4wbuc,1559864165.0,Thank you! ♥️ it’s always so reassuring to be validated
DID,eq8ec2b,t1_eq4o7hp,1559863789.0,She works in mental health
DID,eq8e3th,t1_eq4pbbm,1559863675.0,Yah it was super hurtful and she works in mental health
DID,eq8dyvk,t1_eq5kglr,1559863605.0,Yah we’ve had to have some serious talks but even still my parts do not feel comfortable around her. She is well educated in DID and mental health as she’s a therapist
DID,eq8adkq,t1_eq770x9,1559861750.0,Thanks for the support she’s actually fairly familiar with DID as she’s a therapist who specializes in trauma... she is not familiar with my symptoms at all and she doesn’t know any of my alters. She stopped talking to me for awhile which made us feel abandoned. She started talking to us again but since then my alters do not trust her. I don’t know how trusting she is. Her child is a year and a half and has no idea whether or not I have DID. I did tell her how it made me feel but she said that it’s her daughter and there’s nothing too crazy to ask being that it’s her child... I just feel really hurt. I’ve been there for her so much and it feels like she just has demoted me. Thanks again for your response
DID,eq4jku1,t3_bx4fj2,1559778298.0,the flock autobiography of a multiple personality summary by Joan Frances Casey. I really enjoyed reading this autobiography! It's very well written and the description of her experience with DID is very relatable. I'm not sure if its available in audiobook form but a good read either way
