If you're really that mad at your orthodontist for doing that to you then go to them and tell them. Tell them they need to change their ways, because frankly, by sitting behind your computer complaining about it won't really do much. I hope you realise that the majority of the time they do what they think is right, they don't purposefully do it.

Also they definitely have brains, it takes about 10 years to become an orthodontist. :)"

It could also be related to hormones and such, so maybe your birth control does have something g to do with it.

I also have jaw pain and also have an over bite caused my clenching and overdosing my muscle.. I went to a jaw surgeon last week and we're seeing what we can do about it. I have to be on a pretty much liquid/ soft food diet for about 2 weeks and I'm not allowed to bite foods off, I have to cut everything manually because if we were to bite it off with an over bite, we have to over extend our jaw and it goes out of the socket. Last resort is surgery and braces again but it isn't guaranteed that it will help with my pain. I usually have pain when I have to put pressure on my jaw when eating, I don't know if you experience this as well.
