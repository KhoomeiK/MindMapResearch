It all changes when Morgan Nick was abducted. I remember going to some government building and seeing her on the wall, and on the tv. And then when Kacie Woody in Greenbrier, literally the next town over from me, was killed by an internet predator, my mom became even more worried because, once again we were the same age and we had similar physical features. I remember every time something about internet predators came on tv she'd make me stop what I was doing and come watch it. Back then i thought she was just being over protective."
