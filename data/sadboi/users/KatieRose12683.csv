It is literally impossible to speak to someone to get any help. I go to the chat, which they recommend, and it’s closed. I call and get an automated message telling me the wait time is 2+ hours, then it hangs up on me. And repeat, all day everyday. Luckily my husband is still getting a paycheck and we have a decent amount in savings, although we’d rather add to it and not take from it."
