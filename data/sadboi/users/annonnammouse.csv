Those were the only teeth they had left and they were adamant that they wanted to keep them, after neglecting there teeth for 30+ years. I could see the apex of the 31 and 41 on the lingual side after removing that wall of calculus. Sadly, that person wasn't the only one that I've in that situation. 

If you want to keep your teeth, get them cleaned regularly people!"

PLEASE don't give up your career for this man. You seem to love your career, and he's been absolutely ridiculous. You've even offered to get child care if he wants to go back to work. Even if it eats up his entire salary, it would be worth it if he's happier. 

Definitely give up the man before you give up your career. I make a lot more than my husband also and he gladly stayed home with our son when he was a baby. 

Also- it's lovely that you refer to your income as 'our' money. Do you think he'd do that same making less than half of what you make, when money is very tight? I'm guessing not."

My brother probably had a higher baseline intelligence, but that ended up biting him in the ass as he didn't have to work hard at all for his grades. My sister finished her PHD (chemistry) early and is now head of a research team. My brother had some bad luck, but also likely fell in to depression when things weren't going as planned.

Anxiety,fdbb12f,t3_ekd67q,1578255641.0,"I'm so sorry your going through this. It's a really terrible feeling. 

This crippled me for years. Full blown panic attacks, some that put me in actual physical danger (loosing control and trying to 'escape' out a 2nd story window twice, once running in to traffic). 

It wasn't one thing that helped, it was several things over the course of years. 
1. Re-directing the intrusive thoughts. I hope this isn't triggering for you, but for me it was intrusive thoughts about the vastness and nothingness of space. Similarly, the nothingness of what I perceived to be waiting for me after death. As soon as these thoughts started popping in to my mind, I say 'NO' (out loud at first, in my head now) and start counting to 30, or doing breathing exercises, or an activity that takes a fair amount of concentration (baking with a recipe, organizing a collection alphabetically, whatever.)
Which brings me to the next one
2. Get some hobbies that require concentration. Baking and knitting were 2 that I relied on. It helps 2 fold by keeping my mind engaged and helping me feel accomplished when I complete a project. 
3. For me, I decided to take up running as a hobby (I struggled with my weight my whole life and it didn't help my anxiety and self esteem). Once I got past that really awful first few weeks, the regular excercise made a huge difference in how I felt on a regular basis. I don't want to sounds cliche, but as a regular habit it probably helped the most. After a year, the feelings of anxiety and depression were mostly gone and in there place was a more calm and content feeling. Being able to run or hike in the forrest also helped me feel like death is not something to be fear but just part of the cycle. Seeing life  as it is in nature, which we are more isolated from in daily life, really helped redirect my thought processes.

I hope you can glean something useful from this. I hope your good days outweigh the bad ones."

Can you get some (or get someone to do it for you) cash so that if he freezes you out of the bank account you at least have some money on hand? I'm so sorry, this is truly devastating."
family,fbw6alz,t3_eeqpfq,1577141931.0,"Growing up, my siblings were (and still are) insanely smart. I'm the oldest. My younger sister and brother both graduated highschool with 99.5% overall averages. My sister finished her PHD (which was allowed by the university to be a combination Masters/PHD because of her insane intelligence) with NO debt because she was granted full academic scholarships throughout. My parents were constantly comparing me to them and especially my younger sister. It destroyed my self esteem (this among other things). At 19, I moved away and fell in to a deep depression, constantly comparing myself to other. Literally anyone, I would compare myself to complete strangers and I would always fall short. It took a terrible break up with my ex (who I had moved in with when I left parents house) forcing me to be self-sufficient and make decisions for myself to turn my thinking around. Learning from my own mistakes and judging myself against what I was able to do and accomplish helped build my self esteem. I now have a great career, I may not be traditionally book smart, but I am a caring, empathetic, beautiful woman and I have value. You do too. 
Focus on hobbies and interests that you like. You have your own things to offer. Your sister may have physical beauty, which is very visible and easily noticed by others, but that is just one thing and it's not something that lasts forever. A warm welcoming personality, someone with interests who can contribute to conversations will get you much farther in life than looks alone."

I just wanted to add that my sister has /had (it's in remission currently) Lyme disease for over 10 years. She was terribly sick at some points and misdiagnosed with several other ailments including Rhumatoid Arthritis and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, among other things. She managed to purchase a home, keep it up, care for her pets and herself, finish her BA, Masters and PHD, head up a research team, get married and have a baby. Her PHD was completed before she was properly diagnosed, so she was managing all her terrible symptoms while still getting shit done. So, your husband is likely quite capable of doing the laundry and any household chores. 
 I'm absolutely livid for you and the situation he's purposefully putting you in."

Unless there's an urgent call  waiting for. Have the conversation at a chill time when your emotions are under control and he's not currently on his phone. Frame it as 'i feel A when you do B' so he doesn't feel attacked.
AskReddit,f9mjvx9,t3_e5rsvs,1575462076.0,"Set yourself up for success, and set up the people around you. If you leave dirty dishes in the sink, you won't have a cup for your morning coffee. If you leave work for someone else that you could easily or with very little effort do yourself, you might feel ok about it in the moment but that person coming in to your mess won't be very happy and it will affect the way they interact with others. It will also likely sour their opinion of you. 

Little things can add up to big gains over time."
