blogsnark,fo53iov,t1_fo51wbf,1587516723.0,Amen. I don‚Äôt understand this manicure obsession anyway. It‚Äôs weird as hell. What is wrong with natural nails?!
blogsnark,fnpza07,t1_fnpo50b,1587154728.0,Thank you much. Means so much to me. üíñ
blogsnark,fnpz16u,t1_fnoo6nr,1587154598.0,Exactly!!!!! Yes yes and more yes! I pretty much do MWH exclusive also. And I don‚Äôt think she means harm but yes you‚Äôre 1000% on it! We need more authenticity. And at the very least maybe more open dialog. Like let‚Äôs have the convo all of us together. Let‚Äôs be real. I would respect people much more if they told their truth most of the time and opened the floor for dialog. We pretty much all feel similar. We could heal together. But only in truth. Ahhh so happy to have e-met you also! Best convo! üíù
blogsnark,fnok17q,t1_fnm0n4v,1587127222.0,This annoyed me so bad smh. And her acknowledgement of it on her live was lame. So disappointed.
blogsnark,fnojxtm,t1_fnmke53,1587127152.0,"I haven‚Äôt heard of Caroline but I just checked her out... I think the thing with instagram and social media in general is that there are a lot of seekers and a lot of lost people finding the seekers. And taking advantage? Too self serving? I‚Äôm glad that we are all taking inventory and questioning what we are receiving from people. Maybe social media culture will change. I get the feeling of disordered eating being promoted often. Even if it‚Äôs not the intention of the source... I love Melissa wood health but I get weird disordered eating vibes from her also... I think it‚Äôs good for those of us like you and I, to be constantly connecting and having these convos so that we can keep our eyes open. And follow people who‚Äôs truths actually resonate. Thank you for this dialog! It‚Äôs made me feel a light at the end of the tunnel. üíñüíñ"
blogsnark,fnmioa8,t1_fng5jzy,1587072121.0,it's actually 17 feet now if i remember correctly. Bottom line is they do not really know. The only way to stop this is if we all stay put. The church organization i grew up in completely ignored everything and had a musical and some sort of huge meeting with thousands of people and also small meetings with just the bishops and a few pastors and they are all sick with COVID-19 now. And a few have passed away including my churches pastor. This shit is SERIOUS.
blogsnark,fnmhrwl,t1_fnm11p2,1587071660.0,This is making me so sad. I do not understand why people can not stay put. It's infuriating. Especially since I have lost a love one to COVID-19 this month. My step dad. It just hurts so bad that people ca not cooperate. Ugh so much anxiety.
blogsnark,fnmgkh2,t1_fnhpmt8,1587071038.0,I actually checked her out and fell in love! What she promotes is what I felt intuitively. I just kept second guessing myself because I did end up gaining a significant amount of weight due to my emotional eating. I thought I could benefit from a more structured relationship with food... The whole thing is super frustrating to me. And honestly I just want to feel good in my body again... Constantly feel conflicted about my weight and what is right. I am going to keep up with Sarah because at least she makes me feel at peace with some of the battle. And she loves cake lol. I love her!
blogsnark,fnfxcku,t1_fnflmnx,1586917485.0,"Woahhhhh... this makes some sense tho... there is always a weird feeling I get when she promotes FFactor. I can see why some dietitians would not agree with some of her philosophy. I always felt a way about her whole 18% body fat thing and all the cheese and dairy she promotesüò©. Dairy makes me so sick and eggs. And when following her plan I ended up screwing up my thyroid. Also, are we not healthy at a healthy weight that‚Äôs not a size zero?! I don‚Äôt know of Happy Healthy Sarah but I will check her out. I emotionally eat and am always looking for a sustainable healthy relationship concerning food...  le struggle"
blogsnark,fnfjphu,t1_fnaf9hy,1586909382.0,Really?! I was wondering how people received Tanya Zuckerbrot. I never see anything negative about her... where have you seen her under fire? I‚Äôve tried F-Factor also and I did lose weight but I couldn‚Äôt help feeling super deprived... and weird at times about her... couldn‚Äôt put my finger on it. Although I do find her life aspirational I guess.
blogsnark,fn4ri3d,t1_fn4qd03,1586647396.0,Thank you so much. I truly appreciate the condolences. üíñ
blogsnark,fn4qgzg,t1_fn2flob,1586646775.0,"I came here exactly for this!! I was shook by her MWH workout body. Also, she seemed very out of shape and awkward with the workouts. Which is odd because she does portray herself as working out with MWH regularly... ü§î

It makes me very sad to see her photoshop so much. Especially since her and I are the same size in real life. Size 8. Which she has admitted to before on IG. Weird to photoshop yourself down to a zero..."
blogsnark,fn4jbie,t1_fn3l42w,1586642547.0,I wish they would also... it would be fascinating and informative and also help out a lot of inspiring influencers to make more informed decisions. I remember Athena Calderone of Eyeswoon on IG speaking very frankly about her home renovation project in New York and she was honest about going over budget and running out of money. Avoiding her contractor calls for a bit etc. I found it to be refreshing not only that she made it out on the other side but also just that she‚Äôs human like the rest of us. Trying to make a beautiful life but also figuring it out like the we all are. Made me respect her even more and also feel less alone. If that makes sense.
blogsnark,fn4fodo,t1_fn3flsu,1586640428.0,I saw this too. My family loss my step dad on April 1st the same way... sending so many prayers up. My mom just prayed over them also. We know how it feels to lose a loved one and the pain is immeasurable. Not to mention you can‚Äôt even have a proper funeral so there is no closure. Just open and raw wounds. So. Much. Pain.
depression,ey817tj,t3_cmcier,1566908332.0,"I‚Äôm late to the convo but wanted to add my two cents... I thought going into business for myself would make it better to cope with the depression days but it‚Äôs a whole other stressful place... because on days I can‚Äôt make it out of bed I struggle more financially... if I don‚Äôt work I don‚Äôt make money. Which is scary. Although it does feel good at times knowing I can take time if and when I want. 

One of the things I strive for and hope to change when I can grow my business to a scalable size, is work culture. I would like to be a company that offers a safe and encouraging workplace for all. A place where people can express themselves and even heal while working. It would mean so much to me to be the change I would want to see. 

Meditations before and after work. Mandatory mental health days that are paid time off. I really want to create a place that employees aren‚Äôt only happy to be apart of but a place that offers benefits that can actually be of value to each person that chooses to help me build my business. I‚Äôm tired of the non caring selfish greedy employer that we have all come to hate. Everything everyone is feeling makes me feel so strong about creating something that is healing to all involved. Otherwise why are we here on this earth?! It can‚Äôt all be about making a dollar. 

There needs to be more love and compassion in the workforce. Otherwise we are all missing the point of being on this earth. 

It‚Äôs not living to me to work for 50 years just to retire and wait to die. We should be experiencing health, love, balance and growth. That‚Äôs what‚Äôs missing from our world. 

We spend the majority of our day‚Äôs and time on earth working and trying to make a living for ourselves and family. This whole corporate culture is draining and making us all depressed and sick. Something has to give. 

Sorry for any typos. Rant over."
