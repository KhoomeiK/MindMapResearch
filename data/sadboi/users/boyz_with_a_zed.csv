Also they don't necessarily have unique beans or other items. Some cafes mass order their coffee, pastries, etc. from distributors that many other cafes use. I've worked in a few cafes, so I'm a little knowledgeable about coffee. In the end, it's personal preference. For example, I typically don't like light roasts, so even if a coffee shop has a good one, I'm still not going to care for it. I've dropped some cash on coffee from places that I thought were truly excellent. Some of these cafes seem to pop up like wildfire, and they look cute, but they don't stock good coffee."

I do have PCOS, and my doctors absolutely acknowledge that it makes it more difficult to manage my weight. To that end, they've helped me get treatment with medication and diet. I was actually referred to a dietician who specializes in PCOS. I have to work a lot harder to lose weight that an average person with no metabolic issues. That doesn't mean I shouldn't do it and that my doctors don't encourage me; I just have to fight very hard against my body's natural tendencies in order to lose weight. Small progress takes enormous effort from me, but I do it. However, before my diagnosis I had no idea why I couldn't manage my weight as I'd always been active and generally ate healthy. So I guess my point is people shouldn't be quick to judge and assume they know anyone's situation. There are plenty of people who are overweight because they eat horribly and don't exercise, but making assumptions won't help them either."

About 10 years ago, when I was first diagnosed, two doctors (I switched doctors shortly after initial diagnosis) agreed I absolutely had PCOS. I had most of the classic symptoms, positive blood work and ultrasound, and a family history. My symptoms greatly improved when I started a high dose birth control pill and saw a dietician about following a low GI diet.

However, I moved a few times since and have had two doctors give me a hard time about the diagnosis and pill dosage I take because my symptoms didn't seem as obvious to them. I wanted to scream, ""DUH. Cuz I'm on the pill for treatment and lost weight and shave and pluck like crazy. Take me off the pill and watch what happens.""

So, in short, I hope you can find a more supportive doctor who is more knowledgeable of the condition. Some doctors just suck."
