depression,fqur48f,t3_gl23qs,1589663301.0,Let's all just have a snicker
depression,fquqzzw,t3_gl26c7,1589663252.0,Hope things work out for u :)
depression,fquqsld,t3_gl276t,1589663161.0,There not really your friends if they just give up on you. Try and focus on the positive things in ur life and try and find something you enjoy doing. There's loads of people out there who are going through what ur going through and they would love to be your friend.
depression,fquqbs4,t1_fqpy3mr,1589662953.0,Idk why people see it as a bad thing. It just shows how much I care about the person but they just end up pushing me away.
depression,fqr4cjj,t3_gkgexe,1589577354.0,"At least we'll be able to die with less weight on our shoulders. See what I did there. Anyway you should only lose weight if you want to and if you feel like it would make you feel better about yourself. I feel like I have an eating disorder thought cos I constantly want to eat something but I was enough to have a fast metabolism so I stay skinny. I'm pretty unlucky in everything else though. I have asd, ocd and a bunch of other shit but I still have a few reasons to live and I know i can have a normal life if I really give it my all but my mental health doesn't want that. I'm sure you'll find something that you really enjoy that brings you happiness and you'll make new friends who'll really be there for you."
depression,fqr3evs,t3_gkh1sk,1589576853.0,Yeah I does annoy me a bit when people post stuff about autism and stuff and it just makes me feel like an animal or something like they treat us like babies. It can be dehumanising
depression,fqr2zc4,t3_gkh5h6,1589576622.0,My anxiety makes me feel stressed af and my eyes feel dead like I can barely open them and my neck gets stiff. I haven't been on any medication and I haven't been diagnosed with depression but I do have autism. I probably will take anti depressants in the future but ik what I can say to help you out. Try meditation or counting In your head whenever you feel like that again. Try and breathe and think why you feel this way and try to come up with plans to make yourself feel better. It won't fix your problems straight away and those plans will probably fail but we have to keep trying until one goes to plan. Life sucks but it will get better eventually. Might take a few months or years but you'll be fine
depression,fqr22mg,t3_gkh6pp,1589576148.0,I'm still depressed and I'm still coping with my break up but we just have to find a way to move on. Try focusing on the good things in life and use that to move forward. It's hard but it helps knowing there's other girls and opportunities out there. When a road ends another one is close so try to find a different path to walk on and you might be surprised what you  come across.
depression,fqpsbqr,t1_fqog77c,1589553057.0,Sometimes I feel like I try too hard and I just ended up pushing her away. It's still better than not trying at all but it comes across as clingy to a lot of people
depression,fqofgws,t3_gk116e,1589514049.0,I recent broke up with my ex a few months ago cos she didn't give me any affection and she said she stopped loving. I had to break up with her but it hurts even more how she's moved on so fast when I loved her so much. She blocked me on everything so she doesn't even wanna be friends with me or anything. I try to not think about her but she's the only one who made me feel happy and its like a part of me left with her. I've gotten better though and I'm slowly moving on and I know you will too. It will take time but there's millions of other girls or guys out there that will appreciate us more. She never liked anime anyway so we were doomed from the start tbh. I thought she was my soul mate but ik my real one is out there somewhere.
depression,fqoeijj,t3_gk1f4l,1589513448.0,I also blame myself for the stuff that's happened in the past and I probably will for the rest of my life but I know I can't change it. I still regret breaking up with my ex but I know it was the right decision. I just wish I handled the situation better. Whenever I'm sad or something doesn't go to plan I always blame myself but it isn't any of our faults. We can only try our best to not make those same mistakes again
emogirls,fqk22m3,t3_gisq2o,1589418836.0,So hot x
emogirls,fqk1pkm,t3_gjagwa,1589418654.0,I'd fuck you so hard 🤤
depression,fqj237g,t1_fqj14p8,1589403996.0,The mistake I made fucked my life as well but I still have a few plans to make it better. We just gotta keep fighting until the universe gives us what we want. Try having a warm bath and when you get out jump around and say ill change my life for the better and start making plans. If the place you live has too many bad memories then try and move somewhere new and start fresh. There's loads of things you can do if you really put your mind to it
depression,fqj1kij,t1_fqj18o2,1589403791.0,It's hard but eventually we'll be happier. I'm only 17 and we're both young so we can make our lives better. It's stressful and annoying but it will be worth it in the end. If all fails I'll see you on the other side
depression,fqj19sb,t3_gj6gj9,1589403677.0,I'm only happy in my dreams but the scary ones suck though
depression,fqj14gn,t3_gj6l4h,1589403619.0,No matter how depressed I am I always like to keep myself clean and hygienic. Plus hot showers is like an anti depressant for me. Idk what I would do without YouTube or music though
depression,fqj0qg2,t3_gj6raw,1589403473.0,I hope things work out for you
depression,fqj0hqa,t3_gj6vah,1589403377.0,I wish I could change my past with no consequences though :(
depression,fqj0ets,t3_gj6vah,1589403346.0,I know how you feel. I have those thoughts a lot as well and if I changed one thing In the past my life might actually be a lot better or I could be dead right now if I did change it lol. Going back to change the past is dangerous cos even if you try to save a life something in your life might change as well and it could kill you. It's best to not think about our past mistakes too much and focus on the future cos we can only change the future by what we do in the present.
depression,fqizhpl,t3_gj7864,1589402995.0,It's hard to loves yourself at times but the more things you achieve the more confident you'll become. If something in the past made you feel the way you do now then try not to focus on that too much cos what matters is what you do with your life now. If you lack confidence in yourself then maybe you learning something new might improve that like learning to cook a new dish or learning a new language. Just small things to gradually improve yourself cos most girls like guys with confidence. There's always escorts lol but I'm sure you'll find the right person that truly appreciates you for who you are.
depression,fpt13m1,t1_fps8ttl,1588883038.0,"Same. Kinda wish I was numb so my life would be more bearable but I always feel empty inside. Just feels like there's something missing in my chest and it feels so hollow and empty. My life has always been shit but ever since I broke up with my ex I just feel hopeless and a failure at everything I do. I have asd, ocd and a bunch of other shit so it doesn't make life any easier"
depression,fpgx34a,t3_gd6k7y,1588611062.0,Same. Recently broke up with my gf now I just feel empty inside
depression,fpgwwth,t1_fpgrs26,1588610973.0,Same
depression,fpgp5ch,t1_fpgo6tn,1588606974.0,You'll know who your real friends are when they remember your birthday. Happy bday btw. Not sure if I'm late or early
depression,fpgoxx6,t3_gdd4vm,1588606866.0,The world is a pretty small place. No matter how far she is you two will always be connected if you want to be. It will be hard at first but there's loads of ways for you to communicate like video call and text. If she's moved to another country then it will be harder for you two to meet up often but Im sure you can save enough money to see her. It's not the end unless she doesn't wanna contact you again
depression,fpgoj7p,t3_gddh9f,1588606652.0,I feel the same way. My soul died a long time ago and I'm only living now for my family. I used to have big dreams but they all seem like it won't happen cos I can't even do the easy things right. I recently broke up with my ex so my family are my only motivation now. Just seems like I'm going nowhere in life to be honest
depression,fpgnzeb,t3_gddjqe,1588606358.0,Birthdays can suck especially when the people around you don't care. I don't really celebrate my birthdays and have party's and stuff. I don't like being around a lot of people anyway so spending time with a lot of people isn't really my thing anyway.
SuicideWatch,fpecj7o,t3_gcoqx6,1588544810.0,I feel the same way honestly. It's probably cos I'm lazy but I'm just tired of trying and failing at everything. I'm just gonna relax and not focus on my future problems too much.
depression,fozg8sh,t1_fozg48f,1588190142.0,Same
depression,fozg1co,t1_fozeejo,1588190042.0,I'm sure there's loads of people that think you're beautiful :)
depression,fozdsvr,t1_fozdp1w,1588188983.0,Why do you think that
depression,fozdna0,t1_fozdj7p,1588188908.0,It doesn't matter as long as you're a good person then you're beautiful to me
depression,fozdh1u,t1_fozdex4,1588188825.0,Yes you are
depression,fozdbbq,t1_fozd1j0,1588188748.0,It doesn't matter what you look like cos ugly people are only ugly in the inside. I'm sure you're beautiful
depression,fozd1gg,t1_fozcpfp,1588188616.0,Try and do things you enjoy to keep your mind occupied. There's always stuff to do if you're indoors like working out or just listening to music or playing video games. It helps a lot for me when I feel sad
depression,fozcgjr,t3_gaezi6,1588188339.0,I'm sure you're living arrangements will change for the better some day. Just keep doing little things to get to where you wanna be. Try not to stress yourself out too much
depression,fozc8n0,t3_gaf1gk,1588188231.0,It's lonely af but it's a lot easier if you have a pet dog or cat. Animals are amazing
depression,fozc3nk,t1_fozafrg,1588188165.0,I think you're beautiful ;)
SuicideWatch,fovjkqh,t3_g9nvsl,1588102409.0,I'm also in a similar situation as you. I have aspergers syndrome which is a form of autism I think and I also hate loud noises but eventually you'll learn to deal with it better and as stressful as it is you'll start to adapt to the world. Even if we learn to live with our problems it doesn't change how shit the world is. I wish the best for you
SuicideWatch,fovfa8d,t3_g9r6of,1588100338.0,I hope things work out for you
SuicideWatch,fovf1g6,t3_g9rktb,1588100223.0,I hope things work out for you. Don't focus too much on other people and just focus on yourself. No matter how upset you are there's always something to be happy about
SuicideWatch,foveqf6,t3_g9rxt9,1588100079.0,Just be there for him and let him know how much you care about him. Try and hang out with him more and do things that he enjoys
homeless,fopsso5,t1_fop9nhk,1587970959.0,Thanks so much for replying. I appreciate the advice
homeless,fop6q6t,t1_fop6itq,1587954307.0,Thanks I appreciate it
SuicideWatch,fop2e1g,t3_g8qqr3,1587951567.0,I'm sorry ur feeling this way :(
SuicideWatch,fop26wn,t3_g8r2qy,1587951446.0,Idk but I'm only alive cos of my burdens tbh. Life sucks ass
SuicideWatch,foowle5,t3_g8pozb,1587948001.0,I'm down to talk
SuicideWatch,foowfu3,t3_g8q3iv,1587947908.0,"I'm basically going through what your going through but I don't get bullied cos I don't go school and I basically isolate myself in my room every day. I have a few goals and I have a plan of what I wanna do but I can't do it right now. I have asd, ocd, depression and other shit ill always live with but I know things will get better if I really try. It's still hard though cis I haven't been happy in years my happiness I feel always fades away."
SuicideWatch,fomk235,t1_fokha54,1587892961.0,Yeah sure
croydon,fokyjfp,t3_g235if,1587851392.0,Don't move here. It's trash
SuicideWatch,fokwy1x,t1_fokwjdo,1587850522.0,Please don't there's no WiFi on the other side :(
SuicideWatch,fokwtc0,t1_fokkjud,1587850450.0,I'm so sorry you're going through this. I don't really know what to say but I hope you're still alive. I'm sure your mum care a lot about you and she's probably going through a lot as well. Has your mum and step dad tried going to those relationship therapy thing. They might be able to sort out whatever problems they have. I know your mum really cares about you so please be strong for her and not kill yourself. Try and talk to her and try not to sound aggressive.
SuicideWatch,fokw0it,t3_g80ubu,1587850017.0,I hope things work out for you. I know you're slowly losing hope but there's definitely people out there who would love to be happy with you. Life is a pretty trash game which isn't worth playing but you can make some great friends along the way :)
depression,foku5ec,t1_foku26i,1587849000.0,I appreciate it x
SuicideWatch,foku3tn,t1_foklqfd,1587848977.0,I somewhat relate cos I'm a high school dropout and I have no qualifications or anything. I know things are really hard for you but If you're girlfriend really cares about you I'm sure she'll forgive you. I'm sure she'd feel better to tell her the truth then to not tell her at all and ghost her. At least you'll know if she truly cares about you if you tell her the truth.
SuicideWatch,fokthvt,t3_g7zvc6,1587848645.0,Just tell her how much you love her and give her a big hug and a kiss. I know life must be really hard for you but if she really cares about you I'm sure you wouldn't want her to be sad if you did commit suicide.
SuicideWatch,fokt7hf,t1_fokskeh,1587848487.0,I reported the account on 4 of my accounts. Hopefully Instagram does something
SuicideWatch,foksyfy,t3_g80171,1587848351.0,I'm sorry you're going through this. It may seem horrible but life is a lot better when you have people around you that truly know what you're going through and can be by you're side 24 7. I hope you find someone like that to make you happy. There's plenty of people online who are going what you're going through. If people in school are bullying you then you don't have to be there. You can always study online or just study books and stuff. Try and find something you really enjoy like playing video games or listening to music.
SuicideWatch,foksgre,t1_fokrcpv,1587848081.0,Idk if you'll see this but I hope you find happiness now that you've cut her out of your life :)
SuicideWatch,foks4k3,t3_g80ytq,1587847894.0,I reported the account
depression,fokrb7r,t1_fokr3pn,1587847449.0,I think they just need a snicker
depression,fokqewb,t1_fokq4bs,1587846965.0,Parents can suck
depression,fokpq0v,t1_fokmwva,1587846594.0,It's no problem I hope you and your friends feel better. Try and focus on yourself more though and try and do things that you enjoy. If you're always around depressed people then their energy can spread to you and you'll feel even more depressed. Usually animals like dogs are good for making people feel happier cos they're just amazing tbh. I hope you all find happiness :)
depression,fokkew2,t1_fokj6vn,1587843714.0,Some of the places with less people in it are a bit creepy though. Of you watch horror films you know what I mean lol but if u wanna talk we can if u want. I  promise I won't leave u and we can talk all day and night cos I don't do much tbh. Do u have Instagram or Snapchat
ksi,fokivnh,t3_g7zf2m,1587842892.0,There's a few positive comments in there lol
depression,fokiodn,t3_g7zjc6,1587842784.0,Unfortunately there's always gonna be bad people wherever you go but you can make loads of friends online that you can relate to. You just gotta be careful cos there's also bad people on the Internet. Make sure you talk to them for a few while before meeting them and face call them so you know they are they say they are. Hope u find happiness in this cruel world
SuicideWatch,foki0ed,t1_fokgw7e,1587842431.0,Same lol. I mostly listen to nf and scarlxrd
SuicideWatch,fokggix,t3_g7ybp1,1587841613.0,I hope you can find happiness in this cruel world but when I'm like 30 and nothing in my life has improved and I'm just a waste of space then I'll probably die of thirst cos I'll probably be homeless someday. There's loads of ways to kill yourself tbh but I hope we both don't have to.
SuicideWatch,fokg1qd,t1_fokea90,1587841395.0,When I'm depressed I listen to depressing songs and it makes me feel better cos I can relate to the person. It's weird but I like depressing/dark/rock type songs.
SuicideWatch,foke7sl,t1_fokd4zw,1587840427.0,My life would probably be better if I tried harder but I'd probably be more depressed if I'm still failing at everything I do. There's things that have happened in my life that can't be fixed and I have to live with it so right now I'm just waiting for something good to happen so I can start my plans to have a better future. People will probably say I should try harder right now but I'm just tired of trying too hard and just getting disappointed again. If my plans fail then I'll think of something else until something works or I'll just be homeless and die of starvation cos I won't be the type of person to beg for money or steal.
SuicideWatch,fokd1a4,t1_fokb2nv,1587839795.0,Lol I didn't even get a chance to fail secondary school. I got nothing
SuicideWatch,fokcvyv,t1_fokama2,1587839715.0,Better to just not try as hard tbh. Better than not giving up anyway
SuicideWatch,fok55dw,t3_g7x32x,1587835591.0,I know how u feel. there's things I've done or haven't done that have changed my life forever. I've done something that my family will hate me for but I'm not the same person I was back then. I have so many secrets that I might never tell anyone about but we have to live with them. I honestly don't think there's a way out of it unless you can erase some of your memories but for now idk what to do say to you to make you feel better.
trans,foghgpm,t3_g71jom,1587752632.0,Damn u look amazing ♥
ksi,fogefe6,t3_g76qk7,1587751525.0,Still sick even with that hair 🔥
autism,fofeyol,t3_g6s5wp,1587734383.0,Try and be competitive back. Give them a taste of their own medicine.
autism,fofetna,t3_g6rdx7,1587734290.0,If I'm planning on cooking something new that's a bit difficult I try to watch a video on how to make it multiple times and make sure I have the exact ingredients so I don't mess it up.
autism,fofeje4,t3_g6pel0,1587734101.0,I'm nearly 18 and I still haven't told them I have asd. I've only told 2 of my ex girlfriends and a few friends that I talk to online but haven't met yet. Idm telling new people that I have autism but I don't feel comfortable telling my childhood friends that I have it yet. If they ask then I'll tell them unless they tell me something that's personal to them that I can relate to but for now its my little secret ;)
autism,fofdz2n,t3_g6px6z,1587733716.0,I do this a lot as well but I talk to myself in my head so no one hears me out loud ;)
depression,foev5a3,t3_g6y8t1,1587715842.0,Same tbh. I'm nearly 18 now but I wish I was more social in school and not so paranoid. I'm listening to music in my room isolating myself like I've been doing the past 4 years.
SuicideWatch,fodb5dk,t3_g6vy3x,1587682474.0,No matter how much pain I'm enduring I somehow manage to hide it with a smile. It's something I've always done subconsciously but I probably do it so no one knows what the real me is like. I barely start conversations with the people I've know since childhood cos tbh idk what they'll do with the information I tell them. Idm talking about stuff like this to people ik who've had similar experiences as me.
SuicideWatch,foccbu1,t3_g6pzh4,1587669645.0,"I can relate. I also wanna die but I know it will make my family sad and I do care about them a lot. Especially my little brothers and sisters. I wish I had lucid dreams that felt like an eternity where I can just be happy or just to not be born tbh. I'm still trying to make my life better but I'll probably end up being homeless soon tbh. I really wanted to do better so me and my gf can have a bright future but we broke up so I just feel empty inside now. I still blame myself for breaking up with her cos even though the spark was gone I might be a bit happier if she was with me. I have aspergers syndrome, depression and some other shit which doesn't make my life any easier but instead of giving up I'm just not gonna try as hard and try and enjoy the little thing I still have in my life."
SuicideWatch,foc9l2u,t3_g6lf7w,1587668714.0,Same; I'm only happy in my dreams tbh. I'm a pretty spiritual person so hopefully my next life is better if there is one or maybe I'll just go to hell tbh.
depression,foc5bw7,t3_g6ac7h,1587667285.0,I know how you feel. I have aspergers syndrome and depression and some other shit and it doesn't make life any easier. I recently broke up with my gf because she stopped showing any affection to me and she stopped loving me so there's that. I have no friends and i was hoping me and my family would move house this year but we probably can't now cos of the virus so I have to stay in this place full of bad memories for longer. I honestly just want things in my life to go right for once. I wouldn't say I feel like the same person I was 4 years ago but only the way I see the world has changed and I've learned a lot of life lessons since then.
homeless,fo8rspr,t3_fplp48,1587602511.0,congratulations man I'm so happy for you. I wish the best 🙏🏽
