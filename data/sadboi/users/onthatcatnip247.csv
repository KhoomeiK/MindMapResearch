CasualConversation,fn17gc2,t3_fyovps,1586556300.0,"I couldn't imagine life without it, no exaggeration, I would probably not be alive to this day if it weren't for music. I met the love of my life, whom I'm still with, at a Rise Against concert several years ago and he took me to meet the band. Best day of my life. So in essence, music can bring people together, or give them hope in the worst of times."

I'm sorry about your shitty mom, you deserve much better. I hope you're able to get out of there soon. Best of luck to you!"
aspergers,fh3ctgx,t1_fh21uzr,1581267527.0,"I truly believe one could have both npd and autism, though obviously they're not mutually inclusive. And like you said, autistic behaviors are often misunderstood. For example, sometimes to communicate empathy to someone telling me about their pain, I will tell about a time that I felt similarly (if i can think of anything to say at all). Though it has been percieved as me making it about myself and being a sign that I have no empathy."
ptsd,fgv6jur,t1_fgv24ro,1581138633.0,"Take into account that being surprised with cold water could be traumatic to some autistics who deal with hypersensitivity issues to begin with. Many of us autistics have ptsd/cptsd. Though it depends on the specific person, their situation, and their triggers. You cant make too much of a generalization of what is and isn't trauma. 
But I do agree with you, I hate when people casually use 'ocd' as an adjective."

askpsychology,fdis95f,t3_eis1xk,1578449895.0,"You can get ptsd from experiencing/witnessing any type of abuse. It can really only take one traumatic scenario to develop ptsd. Now, if you experience it more than once or even regularly, you may develop cptsd. Either way, if you're exhibiting symptoms of ptsd, I recommend seeing a professional. Best of luck to you, I hope you find the help that you need. :)"
