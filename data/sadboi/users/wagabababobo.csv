witchcraft,fjo4md9,t3_fego9k,1583520423.0,"1. you dont have to. witchcraft is different between person to person, so you can even be atheist and practice! 
2. you can leave whenever you want if its not right for you, but i would suggest doing a goodbye ritual before you do just incase leaving backfires on you
3. waste not, want not, if the offering is food i would suggest it being in a package or if it is food you can eat it with the deity, and if it is a cthonic god usually offerings are buried so it goes into the underworld for them
4. the internet is the best resource you have. [sacred texts](https://sacred-texts.com) has a lot of free books about wicca, witchcraft, and traditional occultism. 
5. yes! you don't have to do anything you don't feel interested in! after all it is your craft, not anybody elses.
6. like what a lot of people said, cultural appropriation is a big thing, but also gatekeeping and judging can be really hurtful and it happens a lot (i.e TERF witches who don't think guys and non-binary individuals can practice). 

a few more suggestions would be learning about the history of witchcraft, lots of different branches, examples of endangered herbs, and the difference between closed and open cultures."
