SuicideWatch,fr2uagu,t3_gm7ne7,1589844025.0,"Some mothers should not be believed. If she isn’t telling you caring things and doesn’t give constructive advice, I would not believe her. But I do realize this is hard to do. Some mothers live beneath your skin and their cruel words seem a part of you. But try not to listen, believe or trust someone that says you are using your mental illness as an excise. No one wants mental illness to use as an excuse. We want to get rid of them. But if we can’t, they do greatly affect our lives. Negatively. 

I’m so sorry you’ve been abused in life and have tried to kill yourself to escape it. Abuse can leave you feeling damaged. It distorts your radar in life and you go toward negative thoughts instead of positive. I have depression and was emotionally abused. I can relate to how you feel. 

Has there been anyone in your life that has treated you kindly? If not, I sed why you are tired of this world. We need others and if they treat us like objects, garbage, worthless things, it’s hard to keep going forward. I hope you can find some kind people in your life. You deserve so much more and that could turn your life around. I know that seems impossible to believe right now. 

I hope you can get away from your mother and her cruel words. Cruel words are like blades to the soul. They inflict lots of damage. And so does abuse. I’ve been working with a kind therapist to learn to trust people again. I’ve kindled hope there are kind people on earth and that I’ll meet them.  And kind people heal inner wounds by listening p, understanding, and offering compassion. It takes awhile to heal. And I’m sorry that it’s been taking so long for you to heal. I can imagine how much helplessness, hopelessness, loneliness and despair you feel. 

If you want to say more about your life and what dreams you have or may have had, I’m listening."

You try your best to fix everything but it keeps breaking. That’s so exhausting and infuriating. Your efforts are being thrown away. That’s a lot of pain to deal with. Can I ask why you can’t get a divorce? You could still live together if you want, but your finances would be separate. I know you’ve kept your vows but she has broken them. She hasn’t been honest to you and that’s a huge part of marriage. It’s the foundation. Maybe try couples therapy, too."
SuicideWatch,fr2p8p8,t3_gm9lur,1589841302.0,"Your life sounds really difficult. To be bullied over something you were born with and can’t immediately change. Don’t know if plastic surgery can help. Really sorry you haven’t made a real friend that can listen to you, understand, and enjoy who you are. It’s extremely lonely. 

Then on top of that pain, you have conditions that add to your pain. Such as anxiety, an eating disorder, and self harm.  It’s a lot to go through by yourself. I’m really sorry that medication and therapy haven’t helped. I believe how bad your depression is. I have depression myself and it’s like pulling a boulder through life. 

Are you on disability from your depression and everything else? That would be so hard not able to pursue college or get a job. You can feel left out, worthless and unwanted. And on top of that you feel unloveable and ugly. It’s a lot of self hate and hard to overcome these feelings.

Sounds like you didn’t get enough care growing up. You may not have had enough human contact then and hard to have it now. That makes all negative feelings worse. It’s hard because you think you’ll never be loved. We can’t know the future but I understand your thinking. It’s hard being rejected and then keeping hope that you’ll finally be accepted. You feel extremely alone and don’t know if that will ever change. If you feel you are too ugly, have you tried relating to others that feel they are ugly or unloveable. You may find a connection that way through deep understanding of how that feels.  

There are people out there that feel as you do. I believe you aren’t alone in that. Maybe you haven’t met them yet, but there’s still time, even if it seems there isn’t. 

I’m really sorry you feel you have to take your life over this. That the pain is so extreme it seems impossible to live with. I hope you reconsider and find people that feel similarly. Maybe then you can have the connection you crave."
SuicideWatch,fr2ni4i,t3_gm9wn0,1589840414.0,"That’s awful to lose the love of someone you care about so deeply. He’s been your support team throughout the years and now that’s ending. I’m so sorry. Do you have anyone else that can support you during this difficult time? Someone that can listen and understand how painful it is. 

The pain is so great that I understand not wanting to feel it. Your mind goes to suicide first. But there are also other ways to deal with extreme pain. And one way is to have someone listen to you, understand and have compassion for what you are going through. Someone to sit with you. You won’t immediately have a solution or feel normal, but you can feel supported and not alone in this world. And that will help so much. You don’t have to deal with the pain yourself. Let someone else help carry it while you catch your breath."
SuicideWatch,fr2miv6,t3_gmb78y,1589839920.0,"Sorry you are suffering a lot of depression. I have it too and it makes life so difficult. It’s great you recognize there are problems and you want to get help. Try not to blame yourself about how you feel and how hard it is to do things. Self hate won’t help you. 

 I just have to ask, any therapist or psychiatrist? It can really help with depression but for some people it doesn’t. 

How are your grandparents making it worse? Sounds like they aren’t listening to you and trying to understand what you are going through. 

And yes hard to get good grades if you are horribly depressed. Medication and therapy can help with that, but if you can’t get that, there are CBT and DBT and ACT therapy ideas to try. They have to do with thoughts, emotions and compassion. This can help you with feeling out of control. 

But along with that, you’ll need motivation and procrastination ideas to try. The idea of action before motivation. There are lots of books on it. It’s so hard with depression, though. Your IQ drops, memory isn’t as good, and motivation is hard to come by. And without therapy and medication, you have to rely on a lot of will power. 

Talking to others about your pain can help you with feelings of loneliness and feeling misunderstood. That’s why I recommend therapy. You can talk to someone that will listen, understand, and offer compassion along with ideas to try. This helps when you feel like a burden and feel hopeless. When you feel your pain is out of control, it helps to have someone normalize it, provide techniques to lower anxiety and change your thinking patterns. You can also post here if you feel out of control. There are nice people that will understand and provide hope. 

Did you want to say more about what you are going through?"
SuicideWatch,fr2jq2r,t3_gm9gne,1589838495.0,"Sorry you’re going through this. It must be strange going from attempting suicide to thinking about a psychologist. But it could be what you need and what you needed before hand. Suicidal thoughts leave you so lonely and leave you wondering if you can’t handle the pain, how could someone else understand. If you had someone sit with you through your pain, you may not have attempted. I don’t know for sure but I think it’s better than being alone. And they provide suggestions to calm anxiety and deal with depressive thoughts. They aren’t there to change you or judge you. They are there specifically to help you. So a psychologist can provide a place where you can talk about your pain and have someone listen to you without freaking out. You lead the conversation.  If you don’t want to talk about something, you don’t have to. 

A psychologist has really helped me. Someone that listens and understands me while treating me with compassion. You know how it’s nice to open up here with people that understand you. It’s nice to do that with a psychologist.  While you tell what you want to, you begin to trust them. You begin to trust they can handle what you say and treat your story with respect and kindness.

Make sure you connect with them. Then they won’t feel like a complete stranger. There is something nice to talk to a person not really involved in your life. You don’t have to take care of their feelings or wonder if you said too much and they’ll leave you and not talk to you again. You aren’t a burden to a psychologist. And it’s nice to have someone sit with you while talking about your pain. They’ve heard a lot of pain, so you don’t have to worry about shocking them.

I think you should give a psychologist a try. If the first one doesn’t click, try another. Interview them to see if you like how they will work with you.  And if you feel anxious like I do, you can write them out what you want to say and have them read it or you read it to them. That way you won’t forget what you want to say and you don’t say more than you feel comfortable with. 

It can be a new start to having another person on your side as you deal with your painful feelings. You don’t even have to explain your past. Talk anout how you feel right now and what you want right now."
SuicideWatch,fquxlm4,t1_fqujbiw,1589666081.0,"That’s great. It really helped me finally get to admit to another person what I was really feeling. And if he says anything that scares you, please call the crisis line for advice. It’s not only for those suicidal. It’s also for those that care about someone. The thing that bothered me first, was trying to offer a quick fix of getting a hobby. I felt I had absolutely no energy to start a hobby and it felt like my feelings were dismissed. I listen first, and then eventually say how hard it must be to go through, say you don’t have to go through this alone, and go with the conversation. You’re not encouraging them, you’re just acknowledging you hear what they are saying. Don’t say, think of me and your loved ones and how unfair it would be to them. This makes them feel like a burden and adds more pressure. 

You sound really caring and thoughtful. And that’s exactly what he needs. It really still amazes me how healing it is to be listened to, have my feelings and experience acknowledged, and to not have my feelings dismissed as unacceptable because it made someone else uncomfortable. Yes, I’m open to hope but don’t pressure me to agree with it yet. Use words like maybe you could try the following. When you’re ready.

Just think of all the times you really felt understood and validated. It feels good. You want to feel closer. To connect even more. That’s exactly what your conversation will be. Follow your gut.

And start it off with, I sense, or I notice .... I’m here to talk to you about it and I want to listen. And tell him how you sense he’s in a deep hole and you want to offer a hand to hold and to sit with him. 

Just ideas. You do what feels good for your speaking style. 

You can even gently suggest therapy if you feel he needs more than you can offer. Just suggest and don’t demand. 

And I’m also glad you’ll take care of yourself. It’s hard to be with a person unless you have your needs taken care of."
SuicideWatch,fqskwkv,t3_gkpvhg,1589610205.0,"You can find someone that knows him in the area to do that. Or call 911 to ask for a welfare check. San Diego has a specialized division called PERT, psychiatric emergency response team, that can handle that. Hopefully they’ll get the call."
SuicideWatch,fqsgx7a,t1_fqseyrg,1589606967.0,"You make some really good points. But it’s hard to predict our futures. And the uncertainty can actually hurt a lot. 

You are undergoing a lot of stress right now. To me, it makes sense why the voices won’t stop. When we can’t process current pain, our brain and body don’t know what to do. So we look for things that make sense. And unfortunately for you and I, it’s the voices in our heads. I really wish they were gentler voices.

Right now, you’re suffering. You are having trouble with grades, your mother has cancer, and you don’t have anyone to lean on, except your therapist. That’s hugely difficult for one person to deal with. I’m not going to lie, it’s a lot. As for grades, I can see why you have trouble now. You have a lot on your mind. You’re worried about your mother and then there is the virus and school online. Online is harder for lots of students. A huge amount of stress and worry landed on your shoulders. You didn’t ask for this. 

The future looks pointless right now. I can see that. If your present is so uncertain, how is it possible the future won’t be the same way. But we just don’t know for sure. You don’t have to know all of your future right now. There are so many career options out there, you at least know, you don’t want an office job. That’s great insight. Maybe you want to travel more. Maybe own a business.  Think about where you would like to live and if you were to work with people, who would you like to be surrounded by. 

As far as contributing to society, you start as your unique self. Then you can work on making friends so that you feel connected to society. It’s easier to think of the future when you have supportive people nearby. And then think of different dreams to have. The one you choose might be a combination. 

That must be really hard not knowing what your talent is. It’s hard to believe you have one when you don’t get special attention for what you can do. And maybe you haven’t had the chance to explore enough areas to find something you enjoy. It’s going to sound lame, but people go to college just because they haven’t found a direction for their life. It gives them a place to be while they try different things. And they also may conclude they’ll never find it in college. And that’s ok. 

Just want you to know there are possibilities to your future you don’t know yet. That uncertainty can make you worried because it’s unknown. And of course, no one wants a bad future. Just wanted to give you an idea that you still have a lot of say in your future. And just because the present is so unstable, doesn’t mean your future will be. And maybe it will be hard work or just fall together. Try giving the future a chance and work now on making your present feel better. 

Tell your therapist if you don’t like it. They need to know if they are helping you or not."
SuicideWatch,fqsebyv,t1_fqsdmsx,1589604993.0,"But it’s not fine. Is it. You’re hurting. I’m really sorry you are suffering so much right now. I know you might not believe me, but you matter. I hope you can hold out hope. 

Can you reach out to someone and tell them how much you hurt?  Please don’t suffer alone. 

Would you ever consider therapy? It could help reduce the negative voices in your head. You deserve to enjoy some ease. Some nice feelings. 

Do you want to say why you feel so useless?"
SuicideWatch,fqs9yf7,t1_fqs3b9c,1589601878.0,"yeah, it’s really hard and confusing isn’t it. You and I really don’t deserve to hate ourselves this much. I’m in therapy for it, and it’s hard for me to change my mind. I’ve lived with self judgements so long. It’s hard to know what is true? How I perceive myself or how kind people perceive me. I know how cruel people see me. Because I tend to agree with them even at the same time, it makes me so mad they say hurtful things. But look at me, saying hurtful things to myself. 

I wish I could snap my fingers and feel great about myself. But for me, I needed therapy to lower the volume of the hate. I needed to realize how automatic my thoughts are. I also needed more feedback from kinder people. Can I trust them? Why do I trust cruel people? What is so wrong with trusting kind people? My therapist keeps standing by me as I slowly trust that I’m not as horrible as I think.

It’s hard what you are going through. Maybe take some time to ponder where all the hate came from. And why believe cruel people over kind. Is it because we think kind people never tell the truth? I was brought up in an emotionally abusive family. I thought I had to trust my parents that were cruel. That’s where I learned that cruel people tell the truth. There’s ways out of this. And you helped me tonight. You helped me remember that I’ve always wanted to be around kind people, so why don’t I start trusting their feedback more. 

I don’t know where all your hate came from. But I know it hurts to think of yourself only as ugly and useless. Have you ever had nice words said to you?"
SuicideWatch,fqs05n2,t1_fqrzf3a,1589595639.0,"Yes. The everyday hate. Absolute worst. For me, hating myself, it became a habit, automatic. My hate makes it hard to know happiness. I don’t even notice the words anymore except when I get frustrated. Then all my hate comes out. 

I don’t hate anyone as much as I do myself and it shocks me in a way. Did I ever do anything so awful to deserve such ongoing hate. It’s like a few people told me awful things and I took on the responsibility to remind myself. 

It’s awful to endure. You put it well. Thinking you are a walking ball of everything awful. Failures and uselessness. I always thought of myself as a ball of shame to go along with it. Terrible to feel everyday. And be reminded of it when I lookin the mirror."
SuicideWatch,fqrymix,t3_gkmh08,1589594687.0,That must hurt so much to feel that. To feel you’re only valued for your looks and whether someone deems you of use. That’s really difficult.

SuicideWatch,fqqz5fj,t3_gkax6s,1589574612.0,"I think you did the right thing to help you and save your life. I think health is so i,portamt. You can’t do anything without if. And if someone is able to help you with that, I think it’s worth the money. Would you tell someone you know, sorry, can’t save your life and make it better. Costs too much. No, I think you would say screw it, and go forward. Have compassion for yourself. You’re making the best decisions you can with the information in your head at the time. 

And if you declare bankruptcy and it shows on your record, you can think of isn’t that nice, someone will forgive my bill so I don’t have to suffer the rest of my life paying it off. You can also work with the hospital. They may have payment plans. And if you have insurance, the bill is probably not as bad. And if you don’t  have insurance, you can apply for government assistance. 

It’s hard, but people survive medical debt. 

You’ve started a process of healing. Don’t feel bad about it. See a therapist and psychiatrist to get help on your journey. For me, feeling better is worth paying for and trying out different suggestions. Keep on the path. Might as well since you’re already on it. 

I know you want to drink right now, but if you can, try not to drink too much. Alcohol is a depressor. 

And it is a confusing time. You don’t know if people are lying to be nice or telling the truth that they care. I tend toward the kinder truth. And it’s ok to cry. Your body and mind are overwhelmed. It’s a lot to process.

Sorry you feel shame, disgust and Disappointment. That’s so hard. Your mental health is important and crucial. No shame in getting help and none of this is your fault. If you broke your leg, you probably wouldn’t feel as bad. But it’s ok to feel what you feel. You’re being honest about your thoughts and emotions. And I hear you."
SuicideWatch,fqqx1g6,t1_fqquvj9,1589573506.0,"It’s hard to handle all this on your own. It’s good that you are reaching out for help. I would call the crisis line first. Then you would have some professional help at your disposal. Do that before you want to tell his mother. I have no idea what his relationship with his mother is like so that’s why I say call the crisis line first. See what they say. Ask if what I say makes sense. And don’t tell him you called the crisis line. He may not trust they can help. 

It’s hard to hear that a loved one is struggling with pain. You want to solve it for them. But a lot of times, Listening and understanding him will go so far. He’s feeling hopeless that anything can help him. But he still reaches out to you, so that’s great. He hasn’t lost all hope. 

I think your interpretations make sense. When I was suicidal and started to think no one and nothing can help me, I was in great pain of feeling alone in solving it myself. But with you, he isn’t completely alone yet. Remind him that you are on his side and that you care deeply about his suffering. Tell him he isn’t burdening you if he has dark thoughts. These thoughts are scary to hear. So be prepared for that. It’s a big task to hear someone’s  deepest pain. If you can’t do it alone, that’s ok. Reach out to others to talk about your pain. Don’t suffer alone. Just as you don’t want your boyfriend to suffer alone. 

He is trying to trust you with his deepest thoughts but it’s hard. It’s so hard when you feel horrible inside. When you’re suicidal, you can also hate yourself a lot and think no one likes you. 

He may not be ready for his mother to know. And if he talks about a plan and intent, ask the crisis line what you do in that circumstance. That’s important to know.  

Din’t wait till next week. Talk to him and the crisis line today. Probably don’t tell him you called the crisis line. It may scare him from talking to you. Everyone takes that differently. 

I wish I knew exactly what to do. I can only say what would help me. Please definitely call the crisis line so you get the most advice possible."
SuicideWatch,fqquy39,t3_gkecjz,1589572414.0,"First, I believe you need to have experienced love from someone else first before you can love yourself. Try meditating on how you felt being loved. Really recall how that feels. The warmth and care. That feeling of being loved in your body.  Then transfer that feeling of love to yourself. Imagine how that love feels when you aim it to yourself. 

If that doesn’t work, meditate on how much you loved and cared for a special person. Really experience it. Then eventually, see yourself as that person. What does that feel like. Transfer the feelings of love to yourself. Feel the love and how good it feels for yourself. For loving yourself. 

And if you have trouble with love for a person or from a person. Use a pet or small kitten or puppy. They are full of love to give and love receiving it.

That’s how you borrow the feeling of love and use it on yourself. There is a youtube meditation on Loving Kindness. https://youtu.be/c2iCoEluq8A

Then you can learn what it feels like to have compassion for yourself. To forgive yourself for the past. The most you can do is make amends for what you did wrong. And if you can’t do that personally, join a volunteer organization and give your care to others or animals. 

And you aren’t narcissistic because a true narcissist would never think in terms of love for others and ponder the idea of being selfish. 

If you love people, I don’t think you have a dull self. You have a caring self that is having trouble communicating your care. I know how it feels to feel mentally rigid. Where it’s hard to think freely and feel freely. Try the loving kindness meditations. It could help loosen up your mind and feeling body. 

I know what it’s like to hate yourself. It becomes a habit. You think you need to punish yourself. But over time, it becomes a general hate and it’s hard to remember for what. Make amends and volunteer instead. You don’t have to hate yourself forever. You’re allowed to use compassion. You have it for others. Try it on yourself. 

Maybe you think you just hurt others. But you can’t always control that. People can get offended by things that would never offend you. You can’t control people’s reactions. But it hurts, I know that. Just try not to let it hurt forever as a way to punish yourself. You sound like you really care. And that’s a great foundation for a relationship. Work on listening and understanding too. There’s always time and room to learn how to connect to yourself and others."
SuicideWatch,fqqsg0g,t3_gke4xy,1589571133.0,"You can always call the suicide crisis line for how to deal with this. They can give you guidance. 

Trust your gut. If you feel he is leaning towards suicide, bring it up with him. You don’t have to go to his mother first. You can always ask your boyfriend later if it’s ok if you talk to his mother. Maybe he isn’t ready for her to know about his deep thoughts. 

It’s ok to talk about suicide. It could be a relief for him to talk about his thoughts. He could be asking for help. You’ll know more when you talk to him. I have trouble trusting people will help me, and I’ll give out hints and see if anyone responds well to them. Then I know they can hear me and I feel safer to tell more. 

And it could turn out he’s not suicidal. Maybe more depressed and not suicidal. But you’ll know more if you ask him. And even if he has suicidal thoughts, it doesn’t mean he will act on them. If he says that he has a plan and intends to act on it. That’s very serious. Ask him to consider going to the hospital. You can call a suicide crisis line to find out more. This sub has great resources in how to talk to a suicidal person. 

Try to listen a lot , understand where he is coming from, and hold the advice to a minimum. You want to establish a rapport where he feels safe to open up. He could be afraid of burdening you with his thoughts. Maybe afraid you’ll abandon him if he opens up. There are a lot of fears when you are depressed. It’s not just about sadness.

Then to move from your home which grounds you to yourself. A place to come home to and feel safe. I’m really sorry this is happening to you. It’s a lot to process. The unknown is so scary. Your mind goes to the worst case scenario and it triggers dark thoughts. In a way, you think dark thoughts are the only source of truth. They can overwhelm your day. You can feel hopeless during this. And it makes sense and hurts horribly at the same time. Your mind is trying to find a way out of this. It’s a way of finding hope right now. That suicide could end your pain. 

There could be other solutions but they are hard to see. Try sitting down and acknowledge your thoughts so yourself is heard. Then keep sitting and maybe other solutions will appear. It’s ok to not know what the future holds. What matters now is your mental health.

I’m glad you have the support of your boyfriend, and it must be so difficult that it isn’t soothing your pain. You’re being real about this and your truest feelings. Do you think he could handle hearing this? Or maybe part of it? So you can feel real and understood so you don’t have to spend your energy pretending to be fine. 

This is your reality and you don’t want to hide it anymore. You don’t want it glossed over with “you’re strong” because that hides the true magnitude of your pain. And you deserve to tell your truth even if it makes others uncomfortable.

SuicideWatch,fqnjkd6,t1_fqnhrew,1589496001.0,"No, it doesn’t sound strange. It’s a way to finally get attention and care from other people. They aren’t being aware enough of how you feel. And this is one way of expressing it. Thanks for telling me. That’s a hard thing to admit but understandable. But still sorry you feel depressed. Depression is hard to deal with. It’s ok to ask for someone to listen to you and really understand you. That’s a form of caring. And you need that right now."
depression,fqnj21f,t1_fqngprv,1589495736.0,"If something you don’t realize brings you down, I try talking to someone else and see if that jogs anything. There is also mindfulness for slowing down automatic thoughts and feelings. I also journal to see if something pops up. But sometimes, things stay hidden. It may mean you aren’t ready yet. 

I try to move on and be happy, too. It’s hard because there is a big part of me that is sad and wants me to do something about it. And I keep trying. It just feels like there is something trapped inside of me that I can’t see. And if I could see it, I could maybe get help for it. Otherwise, it feels like I suffer alone. And I hate feeling like that. 

In a way, wanting to die means you still have hope something can make the pain go away. I’d never thought of it that way before. But when I was suicidal, I thought it was all hopeless, but thought if I reach out for help, that must mean I still have hope. Hope can turn things around. 

The trick is then growing the hope. After the hospital, I had group therapy with people that felt like I did. I wasn’t alone and I was around people trying to find their hope. That inspired me. I also learned a bunch of techniques to try for my moods. They didn’t all work. It was CBT and DBT therapy. But knowing I hadn’t tried everything yet, gave me hope. 

I feel you about wanting to die. It takes over all your thoughts and emotions. I hope you can find a break from thinking it all the time. But it’s hard, because then you are back to pain you need help with. And you’re having trouble finding that person. I’m really sorry about that. 

You’re a deep thinker and someone will appreciate that. You’re also sensitive about life. Another good trait. You have a lot to offer. Just wish that someone or more will show up. Keep reaching out to new people. I know that’s hard and can be frustrating. And I’m so sorry you feel so lonely right now."
SuicideWatch,fqnhjjp,t1_fqnei1y,1589494963.0,"Therapy isn’t for everyone. Maybe it’s easier to read books that will help you out instead. Eastern philosophy helped me so sometimes other things in life are what you need.

If you take medication, make sure to tell them you still don’t feel great. For awhile, I didn’t question my psychiatrist enough and took meds which were ok. I didn’t have suicidal feelings but didn’t feel happy. I’m finally learning to speak up more and ask for more options. To ask for a plan to feel better.

It’s hard to know our reasons sometimes. Some are so automatic that you don’t even know it. You can try mindfulness to be more aware of automatic thoughts and feelings. If you’re interested."
depression,fqnh0lg,t1_fqnegkn,1589494694.0,"I was never comfortable around my family, so I understand. My parents emotionally abused me so I felt like garbage and alone. I felt like I wasn’t even part of the family. I didn’t have many friends growing up and ate lunch alone. So I relate to your loneliness.

You have severe anxiety around them. That must feel awful. Can’t connect with them. 

Lots of people with severe anxiety have trouble with phone calls. It’s easier to text or send email. I can understand feeling left out of making calls, but you can only do what you can do. And it feels safer not to make any. 

I’m glad you feel you can tell me this anxiety. It helps to tell someone you don’t know. 

I can totally see why your anxiety affects your depression. If you have trouble connecting to people, you can feel left out, like you don’t belong anywhere. And those lonely feelings and despair make depression worse."

Saying you are a disappointment is so hurtful because it’s like declaring that person permanently a negative quality with no chance to tell your story or even have the chance to defend yourself and say your story. My family never understood me. I helped everyone in the family but was later told I was too stuck up. When all I did was help out and help them with their emotions.

SuicideWatch,fqnfii9,t3_gjvz6x,1589493931.0,"Sorry you are suffering so much. Depression is ver hard because it can shut your brain and body off. For me, medication and therapy healing underlying issues has helped me. I don’t believe in just giving things time. I believe you need outside support. And maybe your therapist isn’t the one for you. But only you can tell that. A good therapist listens really well and by offering gentle suggestions. You have to really connect with them.

As far as grief, try reading the book It’s ok that you’re not ok.  https://www.amazon.com/Its-OK-That-Youre-Not-OK-audiobook/dp/B075QP5SGH/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3HI3VQCTG1LGI&dchild=1&keywords=its+ok+that+youre+not+ok&qid=1589493520&sprefix=Its+ok+%2Caps%2C199&sr=8-1

I found it helped me also for depression. But it’s a good one for grief. 


You’ll heal at your own rate and have really good outside support. Lean on people and tell them what some of their advice is won’t work for you. That’s great for asking for more and limiting what doesn’t work. I find I feel worse with advice that isn’t helping me. As if I’m failing. But now I realize there are multiple solutions, and those aren’t the ones for me. 

And maybe join a grief support group. Everyone heals differently so it could make you feel normal knowing how different but in common people are. And I think processing grief helps heal it so you can have good memories and enjoy that. And I can’t say how long grief will last because people are different. Your story is unique. And so what other people say about them may not be what you need to hear."
SuicideWatch,fqne65j,t3_gjt79o,1589493251.0,"Maybe it’s because of underlying issues or trauma you haven’t resolved yet. Don’t forget about therapy if you do. Even if you don’t, you could have high sensitivity to things where emotions feel bigger. Have you heard of DBT therapy? It’s great for emotions that get out of control. Even if you don’t want that therapy, there are lots of good ideas in it. You can find info online, in books and videos and there is a reddit sub. 

An argument can also leave you feeling helpless to defend yourself, so you get very frustrated and angry about it. Even if you win the argument, you can feel revved up like how you feel from defending yourself.  You may be taking the argument as a personal attack on you. Or when you take things as a personal attack, your thoughts can turn to hating yourself. Lots of these reactions lead to a lot of pain and then thoughts go to suicide. Maybe try other things first.

You can write your emotions and thoughts on paper and tear them up or burn them (safely of course). You can apply grounding techniques such as https://lifeafterwardotorg.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/grounding_techniques-1.pdf and https://anxiety-gone.com/15-best-grounding-techniques-anxiety/

If you feel suicidal, try holding ice cubes under your eyes for a few minutes. This triggers a reflex to take your mind off your thoughts. You can do mindfulness. Different than meditation. Look into DBT therapy which you can find online, as videos, and books. It’s especially good for high out of control emotions. 

There is talking to your friends and ask them to listen and not give advice. Oh, but you didn’t want to talk to anyone. But if you do, that’s an option. 

There is a self soothe kit you can look up to see what it is. Basically things to ground you and calm you. You can try a diffuser with favorite scents. 

Punching a pillow and also hugging one for comfort. Cold showers and also warm ones. See what works best. Also cold water on your face. 

Try not to numb your feelings or dissociate. Do the above techniques to get back in touch with your feelings and body. There is also things to do when super anxious. A lot of the above work. There is deep breathing exercises and progressive muscle relaxation. Oh, and music you love.

Art therapy. Draw or paint your emotions.

You’re reaching out here. I think that counts as a lot. Do you think calling a crisis line via text or chat could help? Maybe you don’t like saying it aloud and in person. 

Sometimes we are so afraid of something that our actions are automatic. Maybe you don’t know why it’s hard to ask because your mind automatically says no. You could apply mindfulness to that question alone. I have trust issues, so it’s hard to trust I’ll be listened to, believed and not hurt. 

Yes, depression is so much more than sadness. It’s like your mind and body shut down and you can’t snap your fingers and turn everything on. I also have trouble wanting to wake up in the morning because I fear it will just be painful. I wish to wake up to thoughts that I could enjoy the day. 

I’ve taken DBT therapy and it helped me a lot. There are books about it, online sites, you tube videos and a reddit sub for it. You wouldn’t have to ask anyone in person. 

Maybe when you make a post about your feelings, say you don’t want to be told to see someone because it’s mentally impossible right now. Then people will know to avoid saying that and just hear your feelings. 

Depression is really hard. We’re very strong people to live lives others would find too hard. So try and be proud of your strength. I know it sucks, having to be so strong all the time, but it’s nice to know we are.

You are doing the right thing by reaching out for help. It’s difficult being stuck in your brain alone with suicidal thoughts.

I understand crying when you get so frustrated that nothing is helping. You sound like a sensitive caring person. And we need more people like you in this world. You feel a lot and sometimes it gets overwhelming. Have you ever heard of DBT therapy? It helps when you have emotions that get out of control a lot.

This may not be enough right now. I would suggest calling your therapist if you have one or your general doctor about your extreme anxiety attack. You may even want to go to the ER to get it to stop. Going a week without being to eat is serious. Your anxiety is serious. Please try to reach out and get support and help for it. You don’t have to suffer alone. 

You may also be dissociating if nothing feels real anymore. Grounding can help with that. But I think getting help from a professional will really help right now. It’s OK to get help with this.

I agree, having someone you can reach out to when you need them can help so much. I read in another comment you were told to just get over it. That doesn’t work. If it did, we would all be fine. Sorry counseling hasn’t helped you. Not even hospitals. With early trauma, it can take awhile to heal and it never feels fast enough. I was emotionally abused growing up, and I was always told to not let it bother me. I tried, but I just hated myself that I couldn’t. I finally forgave myself for not just getting over it. It did affect me, and it hurt, and it can affect you after the event. It makes you see life as unsafe and maybe as if you weren’t meant for life.

As far as a friend, are you old enough to attend a depression support group? I made a friend in one because it was easier to talk to someone that understood me. Some meetings are online now and yiu can find them in different cities. I go to https://www.dbsalliance.org/

And did you give meetup.com a try. They are also online right now. Maybe you can join one that looks interesting. It’s easier to make a friend when you have something in common. Maybe read books on friendship and connecting with people. I did, and it helped me get some good friends. But yeah, grew up feeling very alone without someone to care about me and listen to me. 

But yes, it hurts so much being alone. And it is hard to live life with so much sadness. I like that you keep trying. I know that gets tiring. I hope you can find someone that understands your sadness and that understands you. Someone to talk about deep stuff and small talk. You so deserve that."

depressed,fqn3m19,t3_gjs2m9,1589488101.0,"Yeah, people didn’t realize I was suffering for the longest time. And if they did, they didn’t say anything or try to get me help. I think part of it was I was too afraid and embarrassed to ask for help. And part of it was I wore a happy face to fit in. 

I didn’t ask for help till college. I finally felt too much pain and knew asking for help would hardly feel like more pain than I already had. I know how hard it is to just “tell someone”. It sounds so easy. I have trust issues, so I’m afraid I won’t be believed and that I’ll actually be hurt more if I do ask.  

Please do try to ask though. I found it easier to write down how I felt and give that to someone that I thought could help. I was really anxious to ask in person and knew I would forget to say important stuff.  If your family can hear you, try writing them a note. If they can’t hear you, ask someone else that you think has a possibility of hearing you. 

You’re reaching out here and stating how you feel. I think that’s a great start. 

It is really frustrating of wanting help, but having a hard time asking for it. You want others to notice instead. But some people can’t pick oup clues and need to be told directly. It sucks, but it can help."

Any help from psychiatrist and therapy? Sometimes, it doesn’t pan out. 

Sorry you feel like an outsider even when meeting people. I think that loneliness is due a lot to depression and definitely anxiety. Maybe also to growing up with no friends and no one to talk to about it. 

If you feel lazy, you can feel judged by society. You try, so how can you be lazy if your body and mind prevent you. But a lot of society doesn’t understand depression and how it turns your brain off, prevents motivation and focus. Everything can feel hopeless. And any pressure using your mind to make money or do something can feel impossible.

It made me really think. I don’t know the answer really. But I could really relate. I wrote too much in the comment but it felt good to write my thoughts out. 

I have depression with some anxiety but not social anxiety so I can only imagine how much fear people bring up for you. And how uncomfortable that must feel.  Have you thought about trying a meetup.com online meeting? You can join one in a different city or country. It could be interesting to see if it lowers social anxiety since you may never see these people again so who cares if you feel judged. And there is something safer about being in your own space which feels safe and talking through a screen."

Do you think this new label will prevent you from getting your medication? If so, explain that fear to your doctor. It’s a real fear. If they don’t listen, can you see a new doctor. It’s like you were evaluated as who you are now with meds but not who you are without meds.

Doctors a lot of times out labels on you for insurance purposes. Labels are both helpful and not. Helpful in that you can get meds and help like therapy for having a label. There is also identification with other people having the same label. But you are more than a label. I bet there is a huge range in being labeled Autistic. And a huge range in anxiety. You can still post as having anxiety.

But learning to open up is something I need help with, so it’s part of my journey. I’m glad you like your therapist. That’s very important. And if you get pissed off, that’s ok, too. I actually need to work on feeling anger more.

It does take time to heal, but if just some stuff is healed during a period of time, there’s more ease to life. And that’s worth it. It’s hard, but reflect on how far you’ve come. It’s hard because you want more. But if you feel more at ease about things, that’s progress that should be cheered."
SuicideWatch,fqmn81j,t3_gjq5qd,1589480256.0,"I may have written too much. Feel free to jump around if you want to read it. Or come back to it if you want. 

My heart breaks for you that you are going through this. You didn’t deserve this. All your boundaries were violated so you’re body and mind don’t know how to handle it all. You’re suffering so much that the pain is overwhelming your senses. I’m so sorry about the severe panic attacks on top of dealing with your case.  It must be like your world is on fire and people want you to act like it’s not. It’s so much to ask of someone. 

Having a word to describe it helps, PTSD, but it’s so much more than a classification since your pain is unique. So how can your therapist tell you what you will experience? There are averages from people’s experiences to guide you, but you’ll have your experience. Read books on healing from this to get ideas of how to heal and to validate your feelings. Read up on ptsd. or just watch videos if reading is too hard. If you keep feeling dismissed by your therapist, please get a new therapist. You need to feel they understand your pain and move in a direction you want to or don’t want to. 

I’m not a trauma specialist, but I think learning grounding skills to calm things down is critical right now. Hopefully you are seeing someone that is specialized in sexual assault trauma. You need to feel comfortable with them and trust them. Your therapist sounds like he’s trying to give you positive thoughts, but maybe what you need right now is not positive thoughts but someone to be there to listen to your pain in all it’s forms. To understand and validate your feelings. Your body and mind is trying to process this and it’s too hard to do that without a stabilizing support team. In the future, you could consider a support group. But it may be too much right now. 

I’m so glad you have a therapist. And you have so much inner strength for reaching out and telling your story. You have strength you didn’t realize was there. Your story is valid, important and deserves to be told. Try to tell it in a way that is gentle to you.

I’m glad you are supplementing therapy with medication. Your body and mind need something to get the horror back to a tolerable range. I hope you are seeing a psychiatrist so you can get a good combination of meds to get you through this. 

You aren’t useless in managing your experience. You’ve been through a trauma. Something beyond normal experience. You’re triggered by so much and right now it’s automatic. It’s not your fault that you’re not as calm as some zen person. It’s not easy what you are going through. I hope you can have some compassion for what you are going through. None of this was your fault and all of your emotions and feelings are valid. I know things feel hopeless right now. I think that’s a valid feeling. Your world is turned upside down. But you’re taking steps forward. That’s very hopeful. And if you take steps back, that’s valid, too. Be gentle with yourself. You’re very raw right now. There is a meditation to imagine you comforting a hurt kitten. You would be gentle and understanding. And then transfer those feelings to yourself. Imagine yourself as that hurt kitten. 

You’re doing your best. That’s healing. Take care of yourself. Keep sticking up for yourself. You deserve all the care in the world. Find a good support team. Keep reaching out. I just want to give you a hug. You deserve so many. You’re part of the world and a valued member.

SuicideWatch,fqmde00,t3_gjpl7x,1589475594.0,"You must be struggling with a lot and that is very difficult. Sounds like it makes you upset that someone asks for help for a “minor” problem. But on here, there is always more to it. 

No matter the age, you don’t know what is going on in their lives and as a minor they don’t have an easy time getting therapy, seeing a psychiatrist, or moving away if things are hard at home. Chemical depression happens at any age and is very serious. And they have to suffer until an adult gets them help. They could also be emotionally abused at home and have to live with it everyday. As an adult, you can say stop and quit talking to that person or if it gets bad, contact police or at work, contact hr. Someone maybe paying the bills but that same person can be abusing them. They maybe worried about a test because a parent will severely punish them. They may write here because they have no friends. They might have crippling social anxiety or there depression doesn’t allow them to see that people appreciate them. 

Each person, no matter the age deserves to be heard. They may have failed a class. They may have set goals for themselves and it’s crushing to think they may have messed up a chance for college. Maybe they have no one else to talk to about their fears. We all have different fears and problems. And all feelings are valid. What is overwhelming for one person isn’t for another. And because of this, the non overwhelmed person can help another with a better viewpoint. 

And if they blame their parents, there’s usually a huge reason behind it. No one is suicidal from just a failed class. It’s the last straw on building and overwhelming life events.

I’m sorry things have been so hard for you. And if you want to be heard, you can definitely talk about your pain.  Your job sounds stressful. A toxic environment. And maybe you can’t escape that right now. How awful. And if you want to say more about your life, I’m listening."
SuicideWatch,fqkbdxt,t3_gj29ml,1589423827.0,"The feedback I got from my support group was the following. And I’m not saying this is easy to do. Just some ideas of how to have goals again. And along with goals, the drive to achieve them.

To me, this was a good question. I really related to it. 

Start with really small goals. Just naming some can be a goal. Doing the basics for a day, wake up, get up, brush your teeth, eat, etc. In a way, they almost seem like small dreams because it can be difficult to get through a day and do things. But dreams are ok too. Just don’t beat yourself up if you didn’t accomplish them. Make them even smaller. Like thinking of brushing your teeth. Holding the tooth brush. 

Think of goals you had once. What was it about them that made them great goals. For me, it was getting a good job. And what I wanted from that is change, to be surrounded by good people, a challenge job but not so hard that I get overwhelmed. Doing something I’m good at. Feeling like I belonged. And then try to think of small goals that can lead to similar feelings. I want change. I can go outside and feel the plants as I walk by rather than just look at them. To be around good people. Posting here finds good people. 

Try really small changes in life. See if you like them or not. Move forward with the good ones and move away from the ones you didn’t like. Could be to try a cologne. What smell do you like, decide when you want to wear it, or decide not to use it. What shirt to wear. These are small changes that kick start some inner drive. It exercises choice. And that’s hard when you’re depressed. Choose small gentle choices that you really can’t fail at. Maybe you want to try a different burrito. That’s change in life toward a direction you’re interested in to see if you’ll like it. It doesn’t have to be some grand thing. Work with where you are. 

Then there was the idea of vision boards where you clip things or write words and put it on a board to look at and maybe your sub conscious will be activated to think of these ideas as a possibility to go after. 

There was a list idea with post it notes and small ideas for the day. Maybe 5 minutes of exercise. Maybe eating at least one meal. You can put the notes on a completed side and review progress. But this could be too hard when you don’t have much drive. 

The vision board can also be dreams and ideas and not necessarily goals. Something to activate your mind of the possibility of dreams. Probably not huge dreams right away like meeting new people. That can seem impossible. Maybe a dream of enjoying a tv show. A dream of enjoying dinner. Things that you can think that you would like and good odds that they will come true."

The idea of temperature isn’t working but maybe seeing real evidence of you not sleeping will convince them. 

There’s also sleep hygiene to try which says to have a cooler temperature. Like this article. https://www.verywellhealth.com/best-temperature-for-sleep-4428089

Keep talking about how you can’t sleep and maybe need to see a doctor. Then maybe the doctor can talk to them. Maybe it’s sleep hygiene and maybe it’s depression kicking in as well. I have trouble sleeping and take non addictive medication for it.  Try to see a doctor to have someone on your side because sleep is critical for anyone and especially with depression.

You can also try wet washcloths on your forehead and a fan. I hope you can at least get a fan. There are even cooling towels for when you are in your room. https://www.consumerreporting.org/cooling-towel-b/?msclkid=c4cd6431bc26189d45b43a8dc4ad6fd6

There are sleep meditations on youtube to listen to. 

But yeah, I would keep asking and complaining and keep a record of what times you sleep and how much. That can help you when you see a doctor. Because lack of sleep can also be a sign of depression or increase depression, it’s important to do something about it. 

Sorry you are struggling with this. You must feel so exhausted and hard to concentrate, motivate, and have focus."
SuicideWatch,fqiujzf,t3_gh3kgd,1589401082.0,"You’re allowed to make mistakes. You can’t be perfect. Do you get help at work if you make a mistake? Some jobs will help and others just rub it in. So you could be in a bad work environment that saps your energy and doesn’t give you energy to keep trying. It’s hard to keep trying when you think people will blame you and look down on you. 

I’m in a job where you’re looked down upon for having a question, so then I make mistakes and finally get an answer. But I feel so demoralized by the process.

Depression can also affect your mind and how much focus and clarity you have. I run into that a lot and found a job that doesn’t have strict deadlines. 

Sorry you feel so crappy right now. You sound like me and beat yourself up hoping that will help. It never helps me but I keep doing it. It’s a hard habit to break. I know I should be easier on myself, but I have such high expectations. 

I always keep trying till I run out of energy. I’m very persistent. It’s both a good quality and a curse. It’s great for jobs and troubleshooting. It’s a curse if you don’t step back, breathe and look for other solutions. Maybe talk to your boss about getting a few days off? Burnout can cause mistakes. Depression not helped can definitely do that. And anxiety, too. That’s why stepping back and taking some deep breaths can help. 

I’m sorry you are struggling through this. I’m having a hard time at work and relate to your struggle."
SuicideWatch,fqisjir,t3_gj29ml,1589400296.0,"This is a great question that I’m waiting for someone to answer. I’m going to ask my therapist this and my depression support group. They’ll probably say to just write down your goals and start even small ones. But somewhere along the line I lost my hope of achieving goals so I don’t really have goals to believe in. They feel impossible. I feel like I’m floating through life. I did manage to live day by day but during those days, I feel lost and only barely doing my job. It’s hard to see a future so it’s hard to work towards goals in that future.

So this post has me thinking. I’m writing this to get it out of my head and trying to make sense of why I have trouble with ambitions and goals.  Do I need ambitions and goals? Can I go through life without the pressure of needing them? And if I have them, will it be enough to get up everyday. What is it that will get me up each day so I’m not a screw up that can’t get anything done?

I haven’t had any ambitions or goals since I was suicidal and went to the hospital a year and a half ago. I have cyclical major depression that keeps coming back and I ran out of will power to keep pushing forward. That’s how I lived my life. Pure will power. 

I used to have goals and worked toward them only to have my mind turn off and leave me feeling empty again. It’s crushing. My brain failed me. Then I’d have to start over again and the same thing would happen about 4 to 6 months later. I didn’t feel like I was moving forward. I didn’t have the chance to with my depression coming back all the time.

I became suicidal partly because I lost a sense of what the point was. My early life was just to leave my abusive family. That really motivated me. I had dreams of a better life. Then after college, my depression kicked in harder than ever before. My life fell apart. It felt like I was never going to achieve my goal of a better job, better apartment and relationship. And therapy goals of self esteem and confidence seemed like fantasies.

So I’m living in the present like people say is good to do, but I wake up everyday not knowing what the purpose of my life is. It feels like I need one. I think if I knew a purpose, I could get up in the morning.  

I keep waiting for things to kick in. A saying helps sometimes. Activity before motivation. Which means you just can’t wait around for motivation. You have to start with activity first. But this requires will power first which is hard to find. If you have no energy or will power, how do you start the activity. 

So future ambitions and goals are hard to have if I feel everything will come crashing down again. So I fear the present and don’t have faith in the future. I’m afraid to dream of a better future. I don’t know if I have enough will power and energy to get there. 

I need to find more hope. I think hope is what I need to feel again like as a kid when I had hopes of life getting better after leaving my home. It did get loads better, but my thoughts and feelings from those times keeps following me and make me doubt in myself. I doubt anyone likes me and that was one of my goals. To be liked. It’s an inner issue I need to resolve. Most of my goals were to enjoy life with others that liked me for who I was in that moment and wanted to understand me in that moment. But now I wonder if it is all a fantasy. 

So I think finding hope that things can change with the support of others could keep me going. I just have trust issues and it’s hard to believe people will help me without hurting or abandoning me. It’s too hard to go it alone, but I have anxiety asking for support. But when I do get the courage to ask, I’m usually pleasantly surprised others want to help and I feel better. 

This sub is amazing in that. The number of people that understand and want to help if they can. Just hearing their stories makes me feel understood. Like I’m not alone in my feelings. And feeling understood gives me hope. Hope that I’ll be understood. And then I don’t fear the day as much."

You’re really trying to do everything. You have a support system of loved ones, your girlfriend and therapist. But it’s not enough right now. The connection isn’t strong enough.

I’m just throwing some thoughts out. Did you try different forms of therapy, too?  Your job doesn’t sound like it’s that fun for you. Maybe burnout? Or maybe you just can’t get interested in it enough. I have major depression. I relate to that. Then you even stopped drinking which can alter your mood negatively. Which was a good thing to try. 

Yeah, I’m really sorry you are suffering through this. Sounds like you have treatment resistant depression. It takes loads of will power to stick around. I wish there was a way for you to take a break from will power and recharge. I wish you had some easy days."

I completely see wondering what to do when you’ve tried so many things. Oh, and the kicking yourself when you already feel awful. I do that too much. Like that somehow will motivate me and inspire me to make better decisions. I think all our decisions are valid because we did the best we could with the knowledge and feelings at the time. We can’t see into the future. Although, I wish. 

A lot of people are having trouble with school right now. It’s almost harder to motivate yourself because you only go to the computer. But even this is hard. 

I hate it when people fake happiness. Then it feels like I don’t have permission to feel sad or whatever I’m feeling. And yes, it’s one thing to say you care, and another to really listen, try to understand and then give you gentle feedback and compassion. That’s how I recognize care. But it’s still hard for me because I have trust issues. It’s hard for me to believe people really care about me.

Talk to your doctor about stopping meds. Maybe your body needs a different combination. Have you taken a genetic test called GeneSight to try and narrow down meds that will work for you? I haven’t but people tell me they have good results.

You didn’t say, but are you taking any medication or getting therapy for it. Those two things have helped me. I need to be on top of my motivation so if it slips too far, I ask for my medication to be tuned.

And then you mom not only is unsupportive but transphobic as well. How awful. You must feel so alone. Especially with your friends not showing you enough understanding and care. It’s hard to continue without outside support.Sometimes I have to be direct and tell my friends what I need from them. Maybe you need to know they are listening by giving you feedback and you need them to try and understand why you are in so much pain. Not advice feedback but supportive gentle feedback. Do you have anyone else in your life that could help? Maybe a teacher, counselor or relative?  

You’re under so much stress right now. Feeling lonely and unsupported. It makes sense to me why your grades aren’t great. Having courses online can be difficult and then the lockdown makes it harder.  And the support to feel good and concentrate makes things harder. It’s difficult to concentrate right now.  But even knowing why your grades are failing, it still hurts.  

Socializing is so helpful for feeling connected to the world. And without it, you can feel like you are living alone. It hurts so much not being seen and acknowledged and accepted. 

And maybe you even have some depression. Have you looked into that as a possibility? 

It’s hard being a person. And who’s to say what normal is. I think normal is being yourself. Finding out what you enjoy in life and what makes you happy. And this isn’t always easy. And if others don’t like you, find different people. It sucks, but not everyone will like us. That hurts to know. And it could be for some shallow thing. Sometimes it’s from nothing. 

I hope you can at least like who you are regardless of what other people say. Sometimes that’s hard to do but a good goal. And if things are still hard for you, have you considered therapy? I find therapy helps me process trauma and let me be comfortable with myself.

Did you grow up with someone telling you that you are ugly and like garbage. I relate to that if you did. My parents were emotionally abusive and made fun of me.  It really affected how I view myself. People may say I look good, but I feel like they are lying and just saying that to be nice. I believed my parents which I never should have. But now I don’t know what is true. 

Have you thought of therapy specifically for this? I think there is a condition called body dysmorpic disorder. I hate that everything is always a disorder with psychiatrists. It could be part of your brain causing you to hate yourself so much. I’m not a doctor, so I don’t know for sure. Just a thought. Or it could be from growing up hearing negative comments about your body from abusive people. 

Really sorry you are experiencing this. It takes over your mind and you end up hating yourself with a passion. It’s not fair that this happens. Society is getting better about body types. But yeah, it hurts not to be one of the types seen online. Try therapy since your thoughts are so powerful. Maybe then your inner voices and feelings wouldn’t hate so loudly and mercilessly."

I’m glad you have a therapist. But if therapy doesn’t help, try a different form of therapy or a different therapist. Are you treated by a psychiatrist? You didn’t say, and if not, try and see one.


And yeah depression and anxiety make life much harder than for others without it. Hard to enjoy life when you don’t have the energy to enjoy life and you want to connect to people, but they make you anxious. Here you are needing support and asking for it, but nothing so far is making you feel better. That’s really hard.

It must be so hard needing to isolate so you feel safe. Anxiety is making it hard to trust people won’t hurt you. And with your mom not there physically and your father not there emotionally, you probably feel abandoned and lonely. 

Left to learn how to live life by yourself. It’s really good you have a therapist to learn from. But if they don’t help, it’s not your fault. It’s probably you need another therapy plan and style of relating. What you’re going through takes time to heal and feel better. Your rate of healing is different from others. But I know how it feels to want to feel better right away. I want a faster journey to healing. 

Have you tried connecting to people online? So many events are online right now. You can go to meetup.com and find things in a different city or country. You can have the connection of people without being forced to go outside. Or is even talking to people online hard?

Of course you’re tired. You’re going through a lot and handling a lot. It’s a huge amount to go go through and does affect your life. You have a lot of strength and courage but want time so you don’t have to rely on it all the time. 

Is there anything else going on? Sounds like a lot of stress and wondering if there’s more."
SuicideWatch,fqeukwj,t3_gihxqv,1589313840.0,"I’m sorry you are suffering so much right now. I have depression and I grew up in an abusive family, so I relate to hating yourself. It’s a terrible feeling that is hard to describe. It makes life seem bleak. 

I wrote too much but basically, get checked by a psychiatrist for bipolar and BPD. Then you can get on a path to feeling better about yourself. And managing it so you don’t have such large ups and downs. That you can’t choose to just be happy. That a lot of how you feel isn’t your fault and is probably caused by mental illness. Not your fault. Can’t control brain chemistry with will power. And you deserve to be understood and listened too. Some people can do this for you. Some can’t.  Find a therapist that can. Your feelings are valid. 

Really consider getting diagnosed. Even a little bit of bipolar can make a balanced emotional life difficult to say the least. And then BPD is a mess of emotions. Have you tried DBT therapy? It was made specifically for that. It also helps with depression. With undiagnosed mental illness, it can make living much harder than it is. I don’t have BPD or bipolar but I have cyclical major depression and get a lot of help from therapy and having a psychiatrist. I’ve also had DBT therapy and it’s a set of skills I never learned growing up about how to manage emotions so they don’t overtake your life. Getting diagnosed changed my life for the better.

You can have a supportive family and still hate yourself. One reason is having trouble in life where other people don’t suffer from. The comparison is good to spur you onto outside support but is horribly bad in that it destroys self confidence. It’s hard to stop self hate yourself. Especially since it is so ingrained. 

A lot of behavior you know is shitty can be explained by BPD and bipolar/depression and these are mental illnesses and hard to control yourself. It’s not a fault with you as a human being doing their best but a fault in brain chemistry and growing up more sensitive than others plus early learned behavior.  I grew up more sensitive than most people and thought it was a fault with me. But a lot of people can appreciate a sensitive person and for yourself, there are techniques so being sensitive doesn’t hurt so bad. 

Things have been going bad for you, but not all of it is your fault. I think you can only ask of yourself to try the best you can with what you knew at the time. I’m sorry about your hair. You didn’t know that would happen. But it still hurts, I know. Self compassion is hard right now. It’s hard to see anything good in your life. But you do recognize good in having a supportive family. Maybe lean on them to listen and understand what you are feeling right now. That can help a lot so you don’t feel left alone with all this self blame. 

If your therapist thinks we can choose to be happy, I’m sorry, but I think that’s untrue. Even if you didn’t have undiagnosed mental illness, that would be hard to do. If everyone could choose to be happy, there would be no therapists. Maybe consider looking for a different therapist. You don’t have to if you like them a lot for what they do for you. But I would at least argue with that statement.

Happiness comes from self confidence, environmental and health conditions, and outside support. A lot can be helped by therapy and seeing a doctor. And the rest when you have a reserve of happiness to pull on. You can’t just magically wake up and be happy. 

And reading philosophy to ponder my existence helped me. I know, not for everyone. But it allowed me to see things in my life I had ignored. That we are affected by each other. That there are kind people out there. That life is harder for some people than others. That you aren’t to blame for everything that goes wrong. That to love yourself, you need to have been loved.

And depression/bipolar can make you depressed and anxious. Negative events are amplified. Everytine I thought I was lazy it was either my depression or my body and mind needing a break from life getting stressful. So you may be unmotivated, but will power and hating yourself for it don’t always work. And that’s not your fault."

And right now, you feel trapped in the worst outcome. That must feel terrible. You’ve had suicidal thoughts for years and now they are all you think about. I’ve been suicidal before, so I relate to how much it narrows down your focus to negative outcomes.

Do you have depression? For me, it kicks in when I don’t expect it and makes everything harder. Even without it, the stress from the lockdown is understandable. I’m having difficulty concentrating during it and I’m not in school. I imagine school is a lot harder having to learn so many new things. And it sounds like online classes are not how you learn the best. That can be true for some people. Not your fault. 

Every time I slack off, it’s because of something else besides me being lazy. Something with depression, or my environment more stressful, or interpersonal struggles. 

I also think I’m a failure when I can’t do things, but I’m my biggest critic and I can’t see everything.  For me, it’s my depression kicking in or it’s overwhelming stress which triggers anxiety which causes normal things to be really difficult. Maybe that is what is happening to you. 

Try not to beat yourself up as a way of punishment. I know that’s hard to do, but take a step back, take some deep breaths, and consider the idea that you need outside support right now. 

Can you talk to your parents about your grades? You had all A’s and then had a super hard time during lockdown. I’d say you had a hard time not being in class, not socializing as much, and the fear and unknown from the virus. I think this will be the case for a lot of people. Also, colleges look more at grades improving as time goes on. So your educational life isn’t over yet. You just need some help. Nothing wrong with that. So you can get help for right now, get things stabilized, and then get back to learning again. And ask for tutoring if school is still online. And try stress reduction techniques. 

So ask to see a doctor or therapist if you aren’t already since you’re in a really serious place right now feeling overwhelmed and thinking of suicide as an answer. If your parents have been good about listening in the past, try talking to them about your struggles and fears. If not, find a friend, your boyfriend, a teacher maybe. And is your school counselor available by email? They could help you find ways to support you. 

Do you want to say more? I’m listening. You have a lot on your mind right now. It must just be awful how you’re feeling right now, to think your future is over and not have anyone understand yet what that feels like. Don’t be alone in this."

And have you thought of seeing a psychiatrist too since you say you feel depressed? 

And I think it shows real strength and courage to reach out to a therapist and finally have a chance to share with another person all the pain you experience everyday. Therapy and my psychiatrist have really helped me. If you get anxious about what to say, try writing it down and then reading it or when in person again, handing it to them to read. 

I’ve never self harmed, but if you aren’t doing it to kill yourself, it’s fine to talk about.

You could tell him you know things are so painful right now and must have been for awhile. If he wants to talk about it, you’re there to listen. Just listen and understand without pressuring him to feel better. Tell him he’s not a burden to you. In fact, you would like to hear what’s been troubling him. So try to start the conversation for him. 

I know how panicked you must feel right now. You could call instead of text if you are worried. Just say you were thinking of him and wanted to make sure you said ‘the gist of what I said earlier’. You want him to know you want to listen and that you care. 

If he doesn’t respond, call his parents to do a check on him. Just say he was feeling really down earlier in the day and he wasn’t answering. And that’s not like him. Not sure how much to say because I don’t know whether he has told his parents he has suicidal thoughts. But you know, if he doesn’t answer, I can see really being worried. I hope he’s just sleeping.

And there is a pinned link at the top of this sub with advice. You won’t cause her to commit suicide if you talk about it. Make sure she knows that she isn’t a burden. When you’re suicidal, you think no one wants you around and that you are a burden. That you have no one that will listen. Listen without advice. Understand how hard things have been. Her troubles may seem minor to you, but they are beyond huge for her.  

You sound willing to listen and care and get her help. That’s really wonderful. I hope she feels better soon."
SuicideWatch,fqcih81,t3_gi3sls,1589259068.0,"That’s awful. Your parents treat you horribly. They sound narcissistic too and you’re the scapegoat of the family. My parents bullied me and it’s torture. And my dad was misogynistic. So I relate to what you are saying.  Call the crisis line to see what resources are available to you. It sucks being a minor when emotional abuse isn’t taken seriously. But call the crisis line to see what the possibilities are. You can mention you feel suicidal and even want to go to a shelter.  And so you’d like to know what to do to stay alive when living with psychological abuse. 

If you feel like you want to commit suicide and have a plan with an intent to do it, definitely go to the hospital. There you can get the help you need and also see a social worker. I hope you see a social worker.  And they can hopefully set up some therapy for you. 

But please don’t kill yourself. You don’t deserve this. You can still have a life. Please call the crisis line for advice in your area and go to the hospital if you feel you are at the edge and want to die. I’m glad you are considering ways to feel better.

If you want to say more, I’m listening."
SuicideWatch,fqbfusc,t1_fqbapaf,1589236199.0,"Oh, you hear screams of pain. How terrifying. I wish you could scream.  Maybe into your pillow or outside. And if it gets too much, scream away. Are you only taking melatonin? I’m not a doctor, but that’s not enough. You need to go to a psychiatrist. You shouldn’t be suffering like this. 

I think you did a good job in your posts describing what is going on. Tell your parents that. It’s an excellent start.  You have no reason to feel maybe embarrassed to tell them this. This is your reality, it’s hell and people, your parents, need to know. It doesn’t matter if you’re young. You need help. At any age mental illness can occur. It’s not an age thing. 

You know, if your parents don’t get it, maybe do scream if it gets too much. They should know how much pain you’re in, how tiring it is trying to shut out everything. Please don’t give up. Try to write your parents a letter explaining what you go through in a day. Like a diary or journal of a day. Just whatever you feel and experience. It doesn’t need to be perfect. Tell it to them out loud. 

Look up psychosis online and see if it sounds like what you experience. But if that is overwhelming to search through, you can stop.  Sometimes google tells you too many things. It may not match exactly what you have. Show your parents that. Show them youtube videos so they can experience it themselves. If you find any. Sorry I don’t know any right now. And don’t judge yourself. You’re not broken, you just need help. If you broke your leg, you’d ask for help. So if you feel your mental symptoms hurt, ask for help. 

You parents need to know what is going on in your head. I feel your pain. You need help and support. It’s not your fault that you have this. It’s not your fault that you are in pain. There’s still hope."
SuicideWatch,fqbdjdb,t1_fqbawf9,1589235001.0,"That is so frustrating. I really feel for you. I feel irritated you aren’t being believed. Did you get officially diagnosed? If not, try going to your doctor to get tested. It’s a series of questions. Then you’ll have proof you need help now. There is also an online quiz you can use to show them how serious it is. https://psychcentral.com/quizzes/depression-quiz/

Try telling your parents in different ways that you need help and it’s affecting your ability to learn. Tell them in person, write them a letter, show them online articles that say depression is a mental health issue. Ask them why you can’t get help for your mental health but physical health is fine. If you can tell them you have suicidal thoughts and how long you’ve had them. Tell them you feel like a burden and hopeless you’ll get help. Ask why they don’t believe you. What proof would they need to show it’s not temporary. Be a broken record repeating over and over. Ask to be seen by a doctor at least. 

I wish it was just a temporary phase. But you know your mental health and that’s a very good thing. None of this is a judgement against you. You aren’t to blame. And you’re not a burden, you’re their child. 

It makes me so mad when parents don’t listen to their kids. What person admits they have motivation issues, lack of energy, lack of focus, hopelessness, etc. and is doing that as an excuse. No one would think to come up with the words describing depression. 

Too bad about your exams. And damn your coordinator. Some people are idiots and ignorant. They don’t want to believe mental suffering exists. Ridiculous. I’m so sorry for this. 

You could try telling a teacher you trust about your situation.  My teachers would surprise me in their understanding. 

Can you download books from amazon? There are books on depression you can read that give you things to try if you don’t have therapy. One is Feeling Good by David Burns about CBT therapy. Another is The Happiness Trap by Russ Harris. And there are other books about using mindfulness with depression and anxiety. Try breathing exercises if you get anxiety while studying or taking tests.

Also search youtube videos about depression. If you find a good one show it to your parents. I really hope they’ll here you after trying all sorts of ways to get them to believe and understand you.

Please don’t give up. And if you have a strong urge to kill yourself and a plan, go to the hospital. It’s important to take your health seriously even if your parents don’t know how yet."
SuicideWatch,fqbbb95,t1_fqb81cq,1589233865.0,"You’ve tried a lot to better your mental health. You’ve also had some bad luck with therapists retiring and moving. And then you try EMDR and it brings more things to the surface rather than making it go away. How really frustrating and demoralizing. That hurts so much to reach out and having it fail you. Sounds like therapy may have been working but you were unlucky. I hope you can try one again that doesn’t want to bring up anything you aren’t ready for. A good one takes their time, suggests things but doesn’t pressure you to do them. Basically you get support and understanding while you go at your own pace.  I had to interview different therapists till I found one that clicked with me and wasn’t going to abandon me. 

Yes, the lack of motivation with depression. Then the misunderstanding of people that judge you lazy. Judge you for not trying enough when you are just trying to get through a day. But then you do gather up will power to move and get anxiety and panic attacks. I wonder why that is. Too much pressure to do things when you have some motivation? Sorry medication isn’t working. How frustrating trying to hold yourself together. Maybe it will be easier if you could fall apart some days and have that be fine.

I’m glad you are living with loving people right now. And try not to talk or be around those bringing you down. They sound ignorant and uncaring. And really unsympathetic. In a way, they are honest in saying they don’t have the ability to support you. They at least made it clear you would never get support and care from them. That isn’t your fault. It’s a reflection on them. You’re depressed and can’t just magically get better. You need support at this time and not guilt and judgement. You need support without strings attached. 

That’s why the support group idea. There are some free ones online right now that have people with similar life experiences. I go to DBSA https://www.dbsalliance.org/ where you can find meetings in different cities if there is none in yours.  People give each other support, and listen and understand since most have been there. They also offer ideas you may not have tried to feel better. But mainly, it’s being understood without judgement that is so freeing. 

Don’t know if there are online group therapy groups. Your doctor might know. 

Try telling your friends about everything and the pain you’re in. Tell them you want understanding and not quick fixes that won’t work. Tell them you want someone to listen and not pressure you. I told my friends I was in the hospital and they were very supportive. Some even knew others that had been depressed. So I didn’t feel like an oddball. 

Try not to be ashamed. You did what you thought would bring an end to your pain. I was ashamed but then my friends showed compassion and not judgement. They want to understand and be there for you."
SuicideWatch,fqb8o2n,t3_ghwm04,1589232519.0,"That sounds really serious. You are cutting off contact with the outside world. But it sounds like it was too overwhelming for you. You know, saying you’re fine when you really aren’t. You can be loved by many but if your pain isn’t seen, it’s not the same. It can actually hurt knowing you have to pretend to be fine so you don’t hurt your family and friends. As you say, you find their contact stressful and a burden. Like it’s up to you to keep their world going. It’s not your responsibility. 

Maybe being reclusive is what you need to find yourself. If you do reach out, tell them exactly what you need. You need Understanding and not pressure to stay alive. The pressure can actually push you to death and that’s not fair to you. 

Maybe it will help to reach out to anonymous people right now that you don’t have to take care of. We understand suicidal thoughts."
SuicideWatch,fqb77wi,t1_fqayd1o,1589231793.0,"First off, sorry I write too much. I have ADD and my mind bounces around. 

My family made fun of those with mental illness. So I never told them. I was so ashamed, I only told my friends years after my diagnosis. My parents never realized that my siblings were hurting and doing the best they could. My mom always thought her brother was less than. It was only when she was a lot older, it dawned on her that her brother had a mental illness and wasn’t trying to hurt her. She took everything personally. Can you imagine that. She knew he was diagnosed for years but never took it into account. 

Definitely get your brain chemistry balanced. For me, I have the motivation and focus to benefit from therapy because of my medication. So I agree with you there. Yes, it’s awful how people immediately think someone that tries so hard in life is actually lazy.  Makes me wonder if there really are truly lazy people. I wish it was just that. I read so many books trying to fix my motivation problem. Every time, it ends up meaning I need my meds adjusted. 

How awful that the people that should understand and accept you the most, won’t take the time to do that. It hurts a lot. I know that. I’m really sorry your family has been so ignorant. I hope you find friends that understand. Try group therapy or a support group. One I like is free and online right now called DBSA. https://www.dbsalliance.org/ You’ll find a bunch of people that have gone through similar experiences and can offer ideas to try or meds they’ve tried that help. And they understand suicidal feelings. It’s not therapy. Mainly a place of understanding. And since they are online right now, you can join different cities. And it’s free. 

It can take you awhile to find the right meds or maybe you get some that make you better but don’t completely make you feel better. Keep asking for more to optimize your mood. I settled too early because having depression so long, I didn’t know I could feel even better. Then after the hospital, I found the right combo. And if you try a bunch and have side effects, ask for a genetic test like GeneSight. It can help you find meds that work best for your chemistry. 

You’re doing a great job and are on the right track. And remember, you’re really doing your best and beyond with this. You should definitely feel proud of yourself for taking steps in a forward direction.

I hope you feel better soon. Hang in there."
SuicideWatch,fqay2hw,t1_fqawuc6,1589227257.0,"Aghhh, I hate when mental health isn’t included. The brain is part of the body. Mental health is just as important as physical. I’m glad you take your mental health seriously. So if you have a general doctor or can see one quickly, they can help you out with some meds to hold you over. But if not, the psychiatrist is a great way to go. Tell them you are having suicidal thoughts and would like help as soon as possible. And tell a therapist that as well. Try seeing how long it is to get a visit with those three choices, and go with the fastest one initially. Keep the appointments in case you want to follow up. 

For me, the medication was the fastest way but it took awhile to find the right combination. But there are medicines to help stop suicidal thoughts.

I hope you find relief soon."
SuicideWatch,fqax0rl,t3_ghlvwf,1589226744.0,I’m really sorry you are suffering this. It is horrible to feel like that for so long. What have you been trying so you can feel better? It’s hard to do it alone and hope that time passing will change things. I know you’ve been trying to prepare them which shows you are a caring person. What have you been trying so you can offer that same care to yourself?
SuicideWatch,fqawcvc,t3_ghn298,1589226426.0,"Sorry you feel so horrible and that it’s been building for awhile. Can I ask what you’ve tried to feel better? Was it doctor, psychiatrist, therapy, support group, telling someone your thoughts? If not, they can really help. Maybe it’s hard to ask your parents for help. Was that an issue? 

Try to reach out to someone. There are things to try still to feel better without suicide.  Are you worried about going to a hospital if you tell someone? It can help, but if you don’t want to, tell someone you are having suicidal thoughts. That you need to see a doctor right away as you’re having trouble hanging on. Don’t do this alone.

Talk more here if you want. Many have had similar experiences and can give you ideas of how to go forward. I’m listening, too."
SuicideWatch,fqavlhd,t3_ghn4m5,1589226046.0,"Depends on what insurance you have and how high the deductible is. If you aren’t in immediate danger of killing yourself, call your insurance up and ask them.  Also make an appointment with your family doctor first to see if you can get meds to help with the thoughts. That’s quicker than waiting for a psychiatrist appointment, but think of making one now. Therapy can also help you. It’s online at the moment. Get a list of therapists that your insurance will cover. That is either online with your insurance or go to https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapists to find by area and insurance.

If you feel like killing yourself right away, does it really matter the cost at that point. You can always declare bankruptcy if you can’t afford it. 

If you don’t have insurance, see how much it would cost to get some or apply for government assistance. If you go to the hospital without figuring it out, there is a social worker that can help you with that. 

So go to the hospital if you have a plan and immediate intent. If not, call your general doctor, and then make an appointment for a psychiatrist and therapist. If you don’t have insurance, call the crisis line and see what resources would be available. 

For me, I went. My deductible is $8,000, but I had paid a lot already for the year when I went. Unfortunately, I don’t remember the whole cost. It was all a blur. But the hospital helped me a lot. I finally saw a good psychiatrist that sees so many patients on the edge, that he was able to give me a diagnosis and good combination of medicine. The other thing that helped was the hospital had an after care program. You could see if you can join that instead. It’s called an IOP. Intensive outpatient program. 

All mental hospitals are different and people have different experiences. But you can call up some and see what is offered while you stay there to help you."
SuicideWatch,fqat89y,t3_ghqs2p,1589224878.0,"I wrote a lot. It’s about being yourself around supportive people so you don’t have to pretend everything is fine. Like if you are suicidal, you can say you’re suicidal. I recommend support groups, group therapy, with people that feel like you, and a great therapist that won’t tell you things that don’t work for you. They’ll take a slower path so you aren’t overwhelmed. Yes, having no meds is hard so you’ll have to rely on supportive people. Hope is out there, it just may be day to day and not for a full year at a time. And you did nothing wrong so try not to be ashamed. You did what you thought was best with what you knew at the time. 

For me, after I got out of the hospital, there was an after care program because some people try suicide again after getting out of the hospital. Yeah, we learned CBT which was interesting, but the most valuable part was group therapy with other people just out of the hospital. You feel really understood. And you try different ways of thinking about events. Doesn’t mean they all work for you and that’s ok. You aren’t forced to think a certain way. And with a support group, they aren’t paid to help you so the caring, understanding and listening was genuine. 

I also was lucky to stay with a friend to distract myself from suicidal thoughts. That’s hard that you were staying with a friend but it didn’t help. Mainly to be in a different environment than home where I was going to die. It took me months to stop thinking of suicide. I told my friends for the first time that I had major depression and that I was in a mental hospital. I was scared they would leave because I was too scary and not worth the trouble with suicidal thoughts. But they stuck by me. Amazing. That encouraged me knowing I wasn’t going to be thrown away like garbage or thought of as someone not worth the trouble. 

I still couldn’t think of a future. They let me out when I said I could manage a day by day to not kill myself. But I saw no future for myself. I did build on the idea that I still had hope things could change after having gone to the hospital. 

I’m really sorry that meds haven’t worked for you. That was a big factor for me to find meds that worked. But I really do think the support group held me together. I would recommend that. Have you tried therapy where you could at least have your present thoughts and feelings understood. Ponder new thoughts about the future and get support mainly to keep onward. 

There are really good therapists out there that can take a more gentle path with you. To slowly change rather than trying to believe you have to follow a method to get better, and if you don’t, you’re a failure. Try to find a really good therapist that you connect to. They exist but you have to interview multiple people. Oh, and did you do EMDR for your PTSD? 

I’m really sorry you are suffering so much and are having trouble sticking around. It’s hard when meds aren’t there to provide a safety net before you fall too far. You will have to rely on people as your safety net and inspiration to get up again. They can give you support and you can absorb how they care about you into you caring about you. Depression can rob you of the ability to care about yourself. So when that happens, learn to absorb it from your support people. Tell them what you need so you aren’t frustrated by advice that doesn’t work. 

And try not to feel ashamed and embarrassed about your raw feelings of wanting to die. If anything, they have more compassion for you and the struggle you are going through. You’ve been suffering. Of course you’re going to have powerful feelings. You won’t always be that perfect well put together person that lives without pain. Try not to fake it. That takes so much energy. That’s why with a support group and a great therapist, you can be you completely without fear of being judged or abandoned. 

Did there used to be times where you didn’t think of suicide as the best solution?"
SuicideWatch,fq84zjo,t1_fq83a73,1589158613.0,"Oh, I’m so happy that you are out of there. Your mom just doesn’t understand how cruel and abusive her words are. You don’t deserve that.

But right now, you need more. Can you consider going to the hospital. There you can see a psychiatrist right away to adjust meds if you are on any. You get group therapy which is helpful being around similar people. Not exactly like you but can relate on how hard getting a relationship is.  And you can learn techniques for dealing with low mood and anxiety. It helped me a lot. I was suicidal and came out with hope to try again. It was a spark of hope and not huge, but it helped get me going forward.

Don’t know if you tried going to a psychiatrist? Helped my confidence and anxiety a lot. It’s hard in a relationship if you feel anxious a lot. And with a low mood, it can make you really doubt yourself. 

Sorry you don’t have friends. I guess none of the people you’ve met have anxiety because people with anxiety are understanding of how difficult it is.  I know how hard it is when your hopes and dreams are gone. I felt that too. The thing about going to the hospital was I thought I had no hope, but when I thought about it, I must have a small amount of help to go to the hospital. Maybe you have a tiny amount of hope left from posting here. 

Did you grow up in a good family? Mine wasn’t and it set me up to fear people which makes getting into a relationship very hard. I had trust issues about opening up to people and therapy changed me so I could open up. This making relationships easier.

And if you have a therapist, also talk to them. Your depression has really kicked in again. It happens. It happens to me. I have cyclical major depression that keeps coming back. Luckily my psychiatrist has me on a good combination of meds right now. It’s been a year and a half since I was suicidal. 

You can get some non addictive meds to help with getting sleep. 

And when I felt completely hopeless that my life would ever get better, I had suicidal thoughts, a plan and intent to kill myself. I told my therapist and he recommended I go to a mental health hospital. He recommended a good one. They all have different strengths. There I saw a psychiatrist right away to get help with adjusting my meds, I got group therapy, met people like me so I wasn’t alone in feeling this way and learned some techniques to deal with depressive thoughts.

So don’t blame your self. Be proud that you caught yourself in depression again. That’s a big part of finding help. It’s really hard to do because for me, I blame myself and beat myself up before realizing it means my depression is back. 

And maybe stress has triggered you and pushed you over the edge. Burn out is similar to depression.  And since you have depression, it sounds like it got triggered. Ask your teachers if there is anyway to do extra credit. Any last minute tutoring? Ask if you can put off your exams since your depression kicked in and you have no energy, no motivation, and no focus. Can’t hurt to ask. 

Sorry I’m all over the place. I have ADD and my mind jumps around. 

Mainly get help. This isn’t your fault and try not to blame yourself. You did nothing wrong. You have a mental health issue and it got triggered or maybe even building for some time. You aren’t lazy or stupid. Depression can cause you to think that. And if your suicidal thoughts get so strong you want to kill yourself, please go to the hospital. You can take a leave of absence if you need to. Maybe you just need a few days to get your body in tune again. Hard to say since we’re all different."
SuicideWatch,fq7uto6,t1_fq7tmyt,1589152661.0,"I’m glad doing something to distract yourself works. With my ADD, I can get into a super focus mood and lose track of everything else except the task. I even forget to eat. It does take a lot of brain power. At least you had scans to rule out things. But yeah, still sucks not knowing. 

If you have trouble sleeping, have you tried some non addictive sleep aids. Ask a psychiatrist or maybe your general doctor about it. I can’t prescribe but only tell you my experience. Trazodone and Seroquel worked for me. I would hope at least sleep could give you a break from all this. Really sorry it’s so bad that you are screaming. Anything to get the thoughts and voices to stop. But definitely keep asking psychiatrists. Someone has to know what at least is going on. 

You could even consider going to a mental health hospital if you feel like killing yourself.

Some people don’t know it, but it’s hard to tell ahead of time. 

I think it’s ok to keep reaching out. But yeah, frustrating if you’ve heard everything before and know it won’t help you. But there is something to be said for being heard and understood. Did you try a pure medication route. Didn’t see you mention that. There are people that don’t want therapy and only meds. There are so many to try. But yeah, super frustrating if you’ve already tried that. 

You don’t feel like accomplishing a goal. I understand that if you don’t even have the energy to even try it. I wish you did, but wishing won’t make it so. Maybe you just want to be mad about everything right now. Let it out. That’s good to do. You have every reason to be mad about how things turned out.

You shouldn’t have to suffer like this. There is medication that can lessen there occurrence. Not sure if it can make it all go away. But two of my friends have it and for one, the medication made it go away and for the other, he has good days mostly but some bad. Wish I knew the medication name. 

It would be torture. I can imagine how it would be not able to have a quiet mind. Tell a psychiatrist that things are a lot worse. If it is psychosis or not, demand they give you a plan of attack. You deserve to have a plan so you can try things. How do you force yourself to ignore things. Sounds impossible without knowing techniques to try.

mentalillness,fq7qlye,t3_gh83am,1589150216.0,"Just read you don’t want DBT. To me, it was completely different than CBT. It didn’t bring up any memories for me because I only used examples of my present day. Oh, and mindfulness is different than meditation. I thought I wouldn’t like it, but when I tried it, not too bad. It’s about being aware of your emotions in your present day. You may be aware. But it’s aware when they are about to blow up out of control sometimes it’s hard to stop that from happening. For me this helped because I had turned off all my emotions. Don’t know if you did. It’s also helped me feel present in my body and not dissociate so much. I have complex PTSD which of course is different that PTSD.  But try the grounding exercises so you don’t get carried away with a memory of PTSD that might pop into your head. Of course, I don’t know if they do. 

But you don’t have to do DBT if you’re not ready for it. You know what you need. Sorry I don’t know any more medications to try than those I gave in my other answer.

mentalillness,fq7oz3v,t3_gh83am,1589149342.0,"Sorry you are suffering through so much mental illness. I think before getting therapy to process things, you need to read up and learn grounding techniques. That will help you when your thoughts get out of control. 

There are so many medications out there. You say you are working with a GP. I would work with a psychiatrist instead. They know more meds out there and can guide you on which combinations work best. I do have a friend with PTSD and there are non addictive medications to work for sleep and special meds to help with nightmares. I can’t prescribe anything and can only talk from my experience. There is Trazodone and Seroquel for sleep and I don’t know the PTSD nightmares one. If you have any. You can probably do a search online for that. 

For MDD there are lots. But maybe a mood stabilizer like Lamictal could help along with antidepressants. For anxiety, you can try Hydroxozine which is non addictive. For BPD, that’s trickier because I don’t know any for that. Doesn’t mean there aren’t any. Look up DBT therapy. You can find workbooks on Amazon, and online and youtube videos. So you can pick up ideas that work for you. It’s not talk therapy and isn’t for PTSD to bring up bad memories.

I would join a support group if you want to know what meds to try and other ideas. It’s not therapy. Just a bunch of people that understand mental health challenges and have ideas to try. Look up DBSA. 

Oh and try grounding techniques in case bad memories pop up. It’s also good for anxiety. Here are some links

DBT therapy for BDD and MDD isn’t bad because it’s a series of coping skills. They have some worksheets that are how recent events have affected your reactions. How to be assertive. Mindfulness which also helps all parts of life. How to control emotions before they get out of hand. It’s not talk therapy. And they don’t delve into your past. It’s how to make your current life better and more manageable.

And maybe someday you can try EMDR therapy which is to help take away bad memories. It’s not talk therapy either."
SuicideWatch,fq7l0x8,t3_gh2b1y,1589147799.0,"Do you think you have depression? That can lead to a harder life of not accomplishing as much. You can only get so far on will power. It’s not your fault that you don’t have much in life yet. Mental illness can cause life to be more of a struggle than others, have you ever been to therapy to find out why you struggle so much. I don’t think there is any shame in it, though it feels like that. I have depression and it took me finally admitting I need help, to go search for help. You don’t have to go through this alone.

I understand being embarrassed to work at places people you know will see you. It’s hard when you have goals and wonder why it’s so easy for everyone else. You feel left behind and blame yourself. But what if it’s mental illness. That could explain why you have no motivation and just want to die. Maybe you need meds or maybe just therapy. I think therapy helps everyone because life throws a lot at you.

You actually do have an excuse of how you got here. You try your best but still struggle. That’s not your fault. Just means you need outside help. We all do, it’s just that most people won’t admit that. So you feel like a loser but in reality, it’s because you didn’t get help. There could be medical reasons for it or thought patterns you developed growing up. 

I’m sorry you feel so much shame right now. I grew up with a lot of shame. I was a ball of shame. It’s awful. And it stops progress. It makes everything harder because it destroys confidence. Please don’t give up yet. There are still things to try."
