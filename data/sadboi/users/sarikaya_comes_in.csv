If she doesn’t need any of her computer files would you recommend us doing a hard reset?

Here’s some additional info from the email she received.. 
It said she was infected by RAT malware because her browser wasn’t updated/patched. Claimed to have been spying via webcam and audio, threatened to expose her to all her contacts and on social media but didn’t say anything specific about what they would expose. Said they would be watching to see if she read the email and would send it multiple times and maybe even send it after she paid (lol) but at that point she can ignore it.

The only actual personal info they used in the email was her computer password. She’s a broke, very regular college kid so it’s weird to me that anyone would try to extort her. I want to believe it’s a dumb scam but it’s always scary to think someone could be creeping on you or your loved ones"

It’s taken so much stress away, I’m actually performing just as well as I did when I was in hyper-productive & manic except now my brain isn’t darting all over the place and i can actually keep up with my thoughts. As for accommodations, I can work from home within reason, for when I experience insomnia (I rarely do this but having the option is great), I get to to leave work for psych visits weekly, I moved my desk to a well lit area because natural light helps me, and I’ve developed a noise/light sensitivity that comes and goes but the noise one can be very intrusive so they’ve provided me with earplugs and noise canceling earbuds. All those things might seem small but everything together made me feel supported and created a sense of mutual trust between me and my manager. Make sure that you have a doctors note with your diagnosis and their professional recommendations ready though. It took WAY too long for my doctors to provide the proper documentation I needed. I don’t think that’s the case for most folks but I was lucky my job was patient with me about that, seriously took like 2 months which is absurd."

My PT reassured me it was nothing to worry about and alas, it wasn’t.

Keep it elevated as much as possible and don’t be too worried about healing pains. 

Surgery is traumatic and things will feel weird for awhile then go away, then new things will feel weird and also go away, and so on lol. If your pains leaves “healing” territory and enters “oh shit something is seriously wrong here” territory, you’ll know. Happy healing!"

Like sure I could get even happier, even more energetic, but that’s where I need to find acceptance in my condition and make sure I stay in line. 

I still have not figured out where I end and my disorder begins. Sometimes I feel like I get it and sometimes I feel like I don’t.

On top of that, depression ALWAYS comes around and makes it difficult to do ANYTHING. 

Idk about you but even knowing the good things that bipolar can make me feel and do I would definitely not lump it into my personality.

I also tell someone that I interact with on a daily (usually my mom or best friend) that I’m feeling ‘electric’ and if I start talking too much or too fast or go on about nonsense to let me know. Even just giving them that disclaimer helps me contain the ‘electricity’ when I feel it coming on. A lot of deep breaths and calm thoughts. Mani makes my thoughts race and creates a feeling of being overwhelmed and weirdly enough.. sometimes going somewhere private and saying to myself “I’m not overwhelmed, I’m doing well, I can handle this, this is not too much for me” (and so on and so forth) helps  ..Good luck!!!"

BipolarReddit,esrstsm,t3_c8rnfm,1562235610.0,I’ve been on 600 for just under a month and I can’t touch my head without a clump of hair falling out :( I’ve never experienced hair loss before. I’m hoping that it’ll stop when my body adjusts. I get tremors when I’m not hydrated enough but other than that I haven’t noticed too many other symptoms. I wish you luck <3
