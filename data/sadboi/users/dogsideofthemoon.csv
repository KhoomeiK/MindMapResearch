samhaysom,fpmzhfc,t3_gdv47p,1588745822.0,"I really enjoyed the story and it’s such a nice reading and flow. Like many pointed out, there’s a lot of things that you still get curious about when reading it - why was the husband chosen, what happened with Megan, what happened at the end, etc.. There’s a lot to explore yet. The thing is that this isn’t a book and of course you cannot explore everything from a short story perspective, so we have to keep that in mind. I think the only thing that was lacking was the link between the husband and the cult - (why him?). I personally like both open and closed ends, and I always keep in mind that when I’m reading something, it’s the author’s style and story, he’s not writing to fit into my personal preferences. As long as it has a good flow and proper grammar and coherence (or however you say that it’s a well written story - sorry, but writing is not my specialty), like your story had, I think it has the potential to satisfy a lot of readers."
LifeProTips,fpb9ieo,t1_fp9a8j3,1588465006.0,"I think the angry face and hurried walk always work. I travel a lot with my partner and we do not get approached that often because of that, and when we do, we both say “no thank you” a couple of times with a super angry face. They generally give up just after that, but if they still insist we just completely ignore them and act as if they were just annoying mosquitos and go on with our day and conversation (usually in a language other than English that they won’t understand). They eventually give up, and it doesn’t take long - unless we are really the only ones around, but we never give in anyway - you wanna join us and be ignored during our entire walk? Be my guest. I think eventually we get desensitized to this kind of crap, it’s just another thing you have to deal with to enjoy your day, there’s nothing we can do about it."
