The article explicitly states that Trump will NOT be required to wear a mask.

Ford is simply telling the American people that they informed Trump that it is Ford policy for everyone to wear a mask, so that later Trump can’t say that Ford told him it was optional or that they didn’t receive the instructions or some such other BS - like they did at the mask factory."
