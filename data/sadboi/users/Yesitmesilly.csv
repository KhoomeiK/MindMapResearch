Its not very wise to get with someone if you havent fully processed the emotional baggage from your last relationship. You gotta remember how it feels to be happy, single and whole on your own before you date someone new.  I dated a virgo man once.  What stands out for me is the thoughtfulness and his ablolity to think logically even when things got stressful,  ya know.  
Give him time.  :)"
