atheism,fqki8wc,t3_gj3wjg,1589427886.0,"If you want federal funding, pay federal taxes. Or any level of tax. I don’t get why churches are exempt...didn’t even Jesus admit that you had to pay taxes? (“Render unto Caesar...”)"
atheism,fox0m7d,t3_g9sve5,1588131259.0,"Eff him. No, really. You worthless piece of human excrement who has nothing to do all day but sit around and translate a book that claims that women who dress like, well, WOMEN, are causing a global pandemic."
FuckYouKaren,fo962kp,t3_g64cmh,1587611385.0,"I really, really, really don’t want this to come out of my mouth..........but I hope she gets COVID.

At the very least, I hope people share this video everywhere and she gets humiliated."
depression,fnunzd0,t3_g3ljni,1587266689.0,"This is so accurate it’s painful. I know I am bad at initiating conversation...but I rarely hear from people unless they need something. It becomes a vicious cycle, especially when I’m in a depressive state: I’m not hearing from this person because they don’t actually give a sh*t so I won’t text them first because they don’t want to hear from me."
antiMLM,fnniqmo,t3_g2e3nt,1587093309.0,"It’s “lose”, not “loose”! Dammit, if you’re going to chastise someone, make sure you can spell.

I know, I know, not the point."
childfree,fnc61m2,t3_g0lg6q,1586829379.0,"It’s comments like these that have me seeing red. Disclaimer: I love Justin Timberlake and his music.  But to hear him say 24-hour parenting isn’t human?! What did he expect? And as so many are already pointing out, they’re probably in a very comfortable situation with many in-home amenities. I don’t understand how people can become parents and NOT understand it’s 24-7. Which is one of the reasons why I knew I didn’t want to have kids - I couldn’t devote myself to raising children full time. Props to those who do (a good job of it, anyway). I am disappointed in his comments, but he’s made money off of me, so what does he care?"
books,fnc5atr,t3_g0kzbu,1586828925.0,"I’m a school librarian, and although my “classroom” was actually about to undergo renovations, exiling me to another location in the school, I miss the kids a lot. I miss being surrounded by books all day and trying to think of new and creative ways to get the kids engaged in books and literacy. I miss the little ones who still like having a story read to them and are excited to get to take out a book! I miss shopping for new books (I get a pay check to buy books!!) and putting it in a place of prominence. I miss my library and can’t wait to be back."
TrueAtheism,fmlhaa6,t3_fvp3ne,1586186394.0,"I caught this as well...and felt validated. This is, after all, coming from the woman who is the head of the Anglican Church. I didn’t feel like she said it with any disdain."
television,flw7l56,t3_fr68q5,1585541826.0,"Everybody on the show creeped me out...but Carole had an extra-special touch of cringiness. How is what she’s doing at her “conservation” area any different from Joe or Doc?! And the hypocrisy...she’s just as greedy, not paying her volunteers and making them work their way up some kind of whacked volunteer ladder."
worldnews,flmcdat,t3_fpgzdn,1585279852.0,"I am happily staying put in my country that is led by a calm leader, thank you very much."

AskReddit,fk2nfl2,t3_ffy47s,1583804860.0,Helmets?
AskReddit,fjfgar5,t1_fjeeutx,1583291206.0,Why would I get downvoted for this?!
AskReddit,fjeeutx,t1_fjd3cxr,1583270604.0,"So, I have a severe fear of vomiting. Friends had assured us it wasn’t so prominent in the first episode. I couldn’t even make it through the entire episode, I was so traumatized. Not because of the sheer number of lives that would be affected, but by the number of times someone vomited on screen (I stopped after 5)."
depression,fj7mff0,t3_fbu6ub,1583093654.0,"I feel bad, because my response was not intended to be Debbie Downer-ish. I just wish people who didn’t have a mental illness understood just what kind of battle we’re fighting. I’m not, by nature, distrustful by any means, but it takes a lot for me to be able to trust people, to open up to them."
depression,fj6saxk,t3_fbu6ub,1583079082.0,"I have managed to shut out all my friends. I’m not bragging; it is my defence mechanism from getting hurt. It sucks, because I too just want that one person to fight against my efforts, give me a hug, and say they’ll stand by me. And I’m 42, so it’s not like it gets easier."
vaginismus,fip9t3m,t3_f9171d,1582601283.0,"I hate my body - I feel like it has betrayed me. The one thing that all women were designed to do skipped over me I guess. I feel exactly the same way, and I’m guessing I’m even older than you."
AskReddit,etu7uho,t1_ets9eql,1563206358.0,I grew up in Pickering. I was terrified of the nuclear plant. Small world!
