depression,f3por3p,t3_cml6ni,1571062595.0,"I was feeling better for a few days. Now I’m feeling much worse again. I’m angry, and sad, and frustrated, and I’m so sick of myself I want to puke."

depression,ey6lvh5,t3_cvmbzg,1566858663.0,"I slept for 14 hours Friday night into Saturday. I felt horrible when I finally had to get up and go to work, but the emotional weightlessness of being unconscious was too tempting to resist. After about 10 hours I was just waking up intermittently, full of anxiety, and forcing myself to go back to sleep to put it all off a little longer. Indulging in depression sleep instead of staying active is when I know I’m not doing well."

depression,exrhhc6,t3_cml6ni,1566516806.0,"In a dark place once again. Sabotaged a potential dating experience because I kept thinking of my ex and it was all too much. Laid in bed since noon, it’s now 7:30pm. Feeling distant from my friends, with the knowledge that it’s self-imposed. Dreading returning to nursing school next week. The weight of existence is just pressing down on me relentlessly, and I vacillate between complete despair and crying, to feeling nothing. 

To quote the infinite wisdom of Vampire Weekend, I don’t want to live like this. But I don’t want to die."

BreakUps,ev2doz5,t3_chyq1i,1564174997.0,I could’ve written this very post. Sometimes nothing you do will ever be enough. Their fucking loss.
BreakUps,ev2dmbv,t3_ci5bce,1564174957.0,"My ex came back after six months. He proceeded to completely re-ignite all my old feelings for him, and then totally re-break my heart in the span of about two months. I’m still reeling from being thrown back into the depths of heartache I spent half a year climbing out of. 

Just a cautionary tale."
BreakUps,ev2dbkq,t3_ci6ipo,1564174802.0,"I started an entirely new playlist when my ex abandoned me the last time for someone else. I started exploring new music on Spotify, and every time I heard a new song I really liked, I added it to the list. It became my musical catharsis of songs that were *mine*, not *ours*. 

I recommend r/listentothis for finding stuff that would normally be totally off your radar. If you have Spotify, you can then build playlists off your playlist or a particular song to find stuff in the same tone.

It’ll get better. I promise."
