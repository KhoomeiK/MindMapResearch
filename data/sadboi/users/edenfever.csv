Psychic,fmytzyh,t1_fmyqow3,1586495717.0,"people have to advertise as donations on here, because this subreddit does not allow the marketing of paid services. 

because of this, she has to advertise this as donation-based. yes the offer is free, but she is hoping to raise some money for her friend, and in doing so, offering a service in return. 

so yeah, everything sucks right now and now her friend has a very difficult situation on their hands; it's the time to help people, man."

SuicideWatch,fmcv88c,t3_fqtx8q,1585953506.0,"Every single day since I've started my recovering process has just been me mourning the person I was and could have been if depression didn't take me. Now I struggle with feeling worthless and still feel like I'm just wasting life away. 

I'm not actively suicidal anymore, but life does still seem bleak regardless of what I try. It's just this sense of feeling trapped. The people around you think you are doing better, because you aren't suicidal anymore, but it still feels like your mind is rotting and you still don't want to take an active part in normal life."
