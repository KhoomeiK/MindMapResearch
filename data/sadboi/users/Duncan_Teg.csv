There's always going to be toxic fans out there and they will always yell very loudly.  I don't think it's as big of a problem as it seems though.  In general on reddit I think there are more posts calling out toxic behavior than the toxic behavior itself, and I think that can be more harmful than the toxic behavior.  It makes people feel like there are armies of extremists on the verge of taking over reddit.

I don't think that's the case.  I think those people are a loud minority and most people aren't susceptible to their facile logic.  Someone else in this thread referenced the anti-feminism in Star Wars.  In reality there is very little anti-feminism or racism in Star Wars subs.  It's just the loud minority and people (sometimes intentionally) misinterpreting things.  Just because you don't like a movie with a female lead doesn't mean you hate women, but that message doesn't get a lot of clicks.

Fuck all those people who blame anything and everything but themselves for their problems, but don't fall into the trap of thinking they are the majority.  They aren't.

These are just my thoughts on the matter.  Maybe I'm mistaken or not thinking it through."

We all have to control ourselves when we lose.

However, if you play in a group of friends and you all agree beforehand to play slower paced decks, then that's totally fine.  If you don't want people to play infect, then just agree to that and state it clearly before you play.  No big deal at all.

Specialist doctors are really the only people who can define on a case by case basis who is and isn't on the spectrum, but there are edge cases where doctors disagree.
