mentalhealth,etf10sy,t3_cbf2eo,1562756098.0,"When in doubt, go to someplace that you can linger around for a bit like a bar, tavern, library, gym, etc. But you have to find the right one for you. Libraries and gyms are not my preference; I prefer to spend time at taverns. But that's just me. You have to find what type of place suits you best. Then you just have show up regularly. You'll meet and interact with people and eventually someone you talk to will just click. I like sports, so I go to my local tavern to watch a few ganes and get a few drinks."
mentalhealth,etf09k3,t3_cbdr5f,1562755218.0,"I'm sorry to hear that man. You seem like a really nice guy. I'm not sure how to help with your parental situation. But at least it seems like you've come to terms with your mother. The only thing I can think of is try to find a hobby, maybe one you and your dad can do together? It seems like you want him to be like a father to you, so maybe try and find time to go fishing, watch a movie, go atv-ing, or do some other such hobby you both mutually share. For instance, my grandfather is like my father. He practically raised me like a son. But lately he's been more shut off from me and me from him. But every so often we will go out to the pub together, grab a few drinks, and watch a baseball game. It's not a very talkitive experience, but its how we socialize with eachother now that I'm older. 

It's just a thought. Best of luck to you."

mentalhealth,etex0jt,t3_cbcrgt,1562750977.0,"Hey. I'm a 21 yo and I also have Aspergers. I just want to say that I completely understand you.
I started to feel the same way as you do now when I was about 16. But, after looking back on it, I really shouldn't have thought that I was that smart to begin with because, well, I wasn't. My memory, attention, etc. have always been below average. But I had deluded myself into thinking I was more intelligent than I really was.

My piece of advice, ask your parents if they'd let you take an IQ test. Confirm that you aren't actually losing IQ."
