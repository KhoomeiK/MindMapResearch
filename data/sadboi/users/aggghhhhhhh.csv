Live like she'd want you to. I hope you feel okay, maybe not now but someday. I'm praying for the both of you. sending love and hugs. we're all here for you."

depression,fkl4kzw,t3_fj5qpk,1584298349.0,"hey, first off I'm really sorry that you had to sell all your guitars :(

You're not selfish or dumb for feeling hopeless about not being able to play music again. It's what you've loved all your life so it's only natural that you feel so upset about it. 
I hate how you're beating yourself up for caring about yourself. It's not at all selfish that you are thinking about yourself. who else you gonna think about? 
You don't have to feel guilty about making music your priority, even your most important one because that defines you more than anything or anyone ever could.

Are there any places you can work that are music related to keep you happy there? 
You've just had alot of micro stressors built for a long time and it's coming all together. 

I really hope you get the show. Is there any way you can rent out a guitar for the show? 
You're eventually gonna find a stable job which you love and it's gonna do more than just pay bills. 

I'm gonna pray you can buy all your guitars back and you get the gig. 
You're a good person for thinking about your girlfriend and pets before yourself :) 
but you gotta put yourself first, always. 

lastly, hope is something that keeps us alive so don't lose hope and nor be sad. (ma name means hope lol) 

If you need someone to talk to, you can hmu.
Take care buddy!"

relationship_advice,fk4rz5a,t3_fgdjw7,1583866437.0,"First off, I'm extremely sorry this happened to you. This is fucking assault and what your girlfriend and her friends did is absolutely fucked up. It's unbelievably disgusting and you should not feel that you're wrong to feel like this in any way. It's not a fair argument when your girlfriend says that if your guy friends did the same with her it would be different since women are more ""vulnerable"". Man, women or anyone else going through any kind of assault is entitled to feel violated and wronged. Gender doesn't change how fucked up your situation is. Even if it weren't her friends and your friends decided to bathe you without your consent that would equally be wrong. This is fucking assault. It's so so fucked up. You're not wrong to feel like this at all. You need to take this to higher authorities and you need to get rid of your girlfriend. This is not okay. I'm really sorry some people are comprehending this situation differently because you're a boy. and more importantly what you felt is way superior than anyone's opinion. I hope you're doing okay buddy. This must've really been hard to process but take your time and teach a lesson to those fuckers. Take care. We're with you. ❤️"

It's okay. You didn't fuck this up and there's nothing wrong w you. Maybe just tell her that you're shy and awkward. I'm sure she should understand. I think you'll take sometime to get comfortable. If you're having a hard time making conversation just ask her questions like what's her greatest fear and then share yours, what's her goal in life, talk about your childhoods, school, life, love. If you really love her don't hide any part of you from her. I know it's not easy to just talk or have a connection but you'll eventually get there buddy. You're absolutely okay for feeling this way. You're gonna regret not having a connection with someone bc you were too awkward. If she's worth it, don't let her go but don't let her change you and don't be too hard on yourself.
