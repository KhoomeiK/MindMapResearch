For us, I think the Cap stellium is a huge influence, making us want to speed things along and get to what feels like our happy ending. Do you ever feel like there isn’t enough time and that thought kind of spirals into an anxiety? That’s something I’ve always struggled with. I think of Cap as very mature energy. I also think our Sag placements give us a little bit of skepticism and that’s why we start thinking “miserable and alone” when things don’t go as planned.

When I gave him the note from the ER, he yelled at me in front of coworkers about having to miss more than one day. For context, I’m a short woman that grew up around DV, so I don’t really do well when men hover over me and yell. Also, I was contagious. I could’ve made customers and coworkers sick (but of course a lot of restaurants don’t care about that). Then he was just a dick while working the line together that morning. I went outside, had a frustrated cry, then left the uniform hat there with a note that said “I’m sorry but I quit” and left. I really shouldn’t have apologized but whatever.

astrology,fkafegb,t3_fh8xhb,1584005558.0,"No astrology expert here but I dabble and try to learn what I can. Saturn entered Capricorn in December 2017 (this is my Saturn Return) and will enter Aquarius on 3/21/20 BUT, it will RX in Capricorn again on 7/1/20, finally entering Aquarius for a few years on 12/17/20. 

We’re also still in the “shadow period” (this generally lasts about 2 weeks) of the most recent Mercury Retrograde. Which started in Aquarius on 2/16/20 and ended in Pisces on 3/9/20. Anything Pisces is generally emotional because it’s a water sign. Aquarius can also be challenging because it’s an air sign. I read Tarot cards, cups represent water and swords represent air. Both can be very emotional and difficult energies, if you will.

3/9/20 was a Full Super Moon in Virgo. Virgo is an earth sign and earth signs can be stubborn a-holes (lack of a better word) in my experience. When earth signs are happy, life is great! When they’re not, hold on for dear life or distance yourself if possible . I don’t know a great deal about the effects of a full moon but it’s generally thought of as negative and kind of chaotic. Although full moons are beautiful, I don’t think of them as like, happy.

There were also quite a few shifts or planetary changes at the end of 2019. As well as what I believe is referred to as a solar storm. Again, not well versed on those but I imagine it’s possible we could still be feeling some effects.

And lastly, just as someone that believes in energy, is “spiritual”, reads Tarot, etc. There are huge shifts taking place. In my personal life and throughout the world, clearly. I know it sounds “woo woo”, but I swear I can feel it. Things that once felt familiar or comfortable don’t now."

I’m going to stick to life after turning 18. Lol.

2010 - I was 19/20, got dragged to rural Tennessee by family, worked in a grocery store for minimum wage, no real social circle, depression and anxiety, felt pretty alone and lost but knew I wanted more in life, family moved back to our home state late in the year. 2011-2013 weren’t perfect but better than 2010.

2014 - I was 23/24, got very sick and started being diagnosed with chronic health issues. One of the most challenging being a chronic bladder pain illness called interstitial cystitis. I was also formally diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder type II and Generalized Anxiety Disorder. Overall, a very hard year. But my health issues taught me a lot and I gained new perspectives.

2019 - 28/29 and going through my Saturn Return! More health challenges, flare ups of symptoms and that kind of thing. I went back to school! Made some new friends. Met a cool guy, then he ghosted me, then he came back, then he ghosted me again, back, ghosted. It still hurts but I appreciate the good stuff. A year full of ups and downs but since it’s my Saturn Return, I assume it was all needed for one reason or another."

And I understand your point. It’s important to continue treatment whether meds, meds and therapy, or just therapy. The symptoms of bipolar disorder are very individual but I think most of us can agree that we’ve felt hopeless and frustrated when trying to navigate this diagnosis.

I think one of the more unsettling things about it is that I didn’t even realize what was going on until I tapered down.

According to my current psych, this isn’t an uncommon side effect. With that said, I don’t want to discourage anyone from trying Lamictal/Lamotrigine...it was helpful for a decent amount of time.
