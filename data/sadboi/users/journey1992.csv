latebloomerlesbians,fr4vwzl,t1_fr4rsde,1589897888.0,"Thanks for sharing, i relate so much! I wonder if you agree but do you think a huge reason we were so picky about
Men being a certain height was because we aren‚Äôt attracted to them so any little thing would be an excuse to leave them? Like I definitely was very shallow and had high expectations with men but I really think it was because i am not attracted to them and was finding excuses not to be with men. I seeked out unavailable men and was scared to be tied down in a relationship with a man.

with women.. I am noticing I don‚Äôt have all these criteria‚Äôs I had with men, like height isn‚Äôt going to stop me from falling in love. I recently fell in love with someone and would have loved to date them and do not worry about settling down. Do you agree?"

latebloomerlesbians,fr4p0j5,t1_fr4oqpx,1589893862.0,Thanks for your perspective.. you get rejected for being 5‚Äô3‚Äù? That is such a nice height IMO. Do you think the people that rejected you were taller or something?

CPTSD,fm1km7g,t1_fm1hs25,1585680139.0,"Thanks.. but to be frank, 
I worry my therapist will end therapy with me because they don‚Äôt seem to be comfortable or have much experience working with erotic transference. When I first told them about my attraction, they said they had to set a boundary about not letting me talk about their attraction to them and only talk about the attachment piece. Then last week, I told them I read it would be very beneficial for me to discuss the erotic transference. First they were said they would have to think about it but then I convinced them to talk about the erotic transference... which ended up being a beneficial session as we uncovered more trauma core beliefs."
