Art,ficifqj,t1_ficbq6p,1582348161.0,"I agree with what you are saying 100%, as I have personally been taught in other classes to practice all kinds of people regardless of body shape, age, race, etc. In fact, I‚Äôve had other professors go out of their way to talk about diversity in human features and to practice drawing faces of people of the same race as the character you are drawing, which makes sense to me. However, this professor was very blunt and thoughtless in his wording and it made me wonder if he put it that way in particular because it was something taught at art schools/in higher academic settings (I‚Äôm in my first year here.) 

Thank you for the excellent clarification! I really couldn‚Äôt see a reason why he would say something like ‚Äúpeople of color are harder to draw‚Äù and ‚Äúif you‚Äôre going to draw people of color it will be more work for you‚Äù (both verbatim, this was on a recorded class session) especially for a sketching class that involved no rendering and only line work. One thought that crossed my mind is that because this professor is Caucasian and he has not practiced drawing people of other races, it may be challenging for him to draw people of color, and so he based this instruction off of this. It‚Äôs still very off-putting to know that this professor teaches this way."
Art,fibpy6n,t1_fibfpd1,1582327394.0,"This answer doesn‚Äôt explain the reasoning behind the implication that Caucasian features are easier to draw than features of other ethnicities. What makes a Caucasian nose easier to draw than, let‚Äôs say, a nose of a person of Hispanic descent? How about a mouth of a person of African descent? 

Is it a matter of fact that Caucasian features are easier to draw? It‚Äôs the first time I‚Äôve been told this. Wanted to know if it‚Äôs something that is widely taught across academic art disciplines."
Art,fibkv98,t1_fibfbyz,1582324145.0,"I‚Äôm not sure if the intent was malicious, but the statement my professor made definitely comes across as non-inclusive and oddly Caucasian-centric."
Art,fibkkcl,t1_fibftn7,1582323957.0,"It definitely felt jarring hearing this particular instruction, as I am of Japanese and Korean descent myself. I was doubting myself, though, since this was my first time taking portraiture and didn‚Äôt know what the academic standard was. This definitely came across as an Caucasian-centric idea and not very inclusive of non-Caucasian subjects/people. Thank you for your input, I will try reaching out to the faculty anonymously regarding this matter."

I‚Äôm living my dream but the double edged sword of going to an expensive art school is that school costs prevent you from having enough money left over to use on the entertainment, especially relevant stuff to the things you‚Äôre studying. I‚Äôve been eager to watch the Mandelorian and to study the 3D effects, but I‚Äôm at a point where I have to put my food costs + rent first. I would love the opportunity to just view the series while I work.
One good deed, if you could call it that, was to offer help for depression to a classmate. My project teammate let me know they were going through depression recently, and I took the time to hear them out and set them up with options."
