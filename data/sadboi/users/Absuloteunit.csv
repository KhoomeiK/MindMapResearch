ptsd,fajqsww,t3_dy3w0c,1576151520.0,I wanna thank you guys for the kind words and resources. I met with my therapist who officially entered in my CPTSD diagnosis and I’ll be starting EMDR after New Years. This really is a great community on here.
ptsd,f7ypkct,t1_f7ynee8,1574098810.0,Thank you. It does seem to be neutral and non-specific. I think ive seen it in search results but saw va and was disappointed.

If my mom wasn’t getting childcare through the government, it’d be $500 A WEEK. Your home isn’t childproofed and that’d lead to you being in deep shit if the kid got hurt. Plus, stuff for kids is expensive as hell. 

The mother isn’t an asshole either, just a bit insensitive in the moment. She knew she needed to take care of herself and in turn, fucked you and her son over. Not purposefully though. I understand."
