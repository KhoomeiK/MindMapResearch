I feel like quarantine acted as a ‘reset’ button where we were forced to confront our demons and be honest with ourselves. 

There were so many deep seated issues that I was pushing to the back of my mind since there were more pressing matters that took priority - work, school etc. I’m sure many can relate. We were forced to face those issues head on and come up with creative solutions for them in the semi-comfortable space of isolation. 

Someone discovered their job isn’t what they want it to be, someone else improves skills like meditation. To me this is positive stuff. A small sliver of hope that things won’t be as bleary when we face the inevitable reopening of the world. We made it through a monumental shift in society, we can make it through lots more hahaha."

Vs something like cocaine, which only alters the excitatory pathways. It binds to the dopamine/serotonin reuptake pumps, which allows these neurotransmitters in the synapses to remain and to keep sending the excitatory signal down neurons. 

Weed on the other hand.... it’s not so pinpointed. There are endocannabinoid receptors EVERYWHERE in the body - brain and gut. Their placement determines their effect, which also differs. It does a multitude of things. That’s why it’s such a tough drug to study compared to other drugs. There’s still so much we don’t understand about it."

The thing is, people are never static. The people they were when they first got married are not the people they are now. That applies to nearly everyone. We are constantly changing, which means there’s a possibility that the husband too can change from this bad place he’s starting to veer towards. 

It’s toxic if he continues to make such comments and takes those comments from a place of idea to a place of action. 

Also, sex is an integral part in a relationship between two individuals, so I don’t agree with your statement ‘no one needs sex’. It’s key for a couple to be intimate both sexually and emotionally with one another, it increases bonding between the couple."
relationship_advice,fq1arb0,t1_fq14iy5,1589043883.0,"The automatic reaction shouldn’t be to leave her husband. First they need to fix their communication, and she needs to explain to him how his comments were distasteful. Probably came from a place of frustration. I’m not justifying his actions but fuck why is everyone’s immediate response ‘divorce his ass’. You work through problems in a marriage, not run away from them.

mentalhealth,fpoz1ao,t1_fpowyov,1588793107.0,"That sounds awful, and what a terrible climate to come of age in. It sucks because they want what’s best for you but it comes out all wrong and convoluted and so monumentally messed up and selfish in a way. I can’t imagine what a number that must’ve done on your feelings of self-worth or lack thereof. 

I have younger sisters so I can understand the difficult position of trying to put your needs first but also sacrificing to improve their well-being too. It’s really and truly a tough spot. 

You can find a way to distance yourself from your parents’ pervasive negative attitudes and also be there for your younger brother. I found that when I came to terms with what my parents inflicted on me growing up, that I was able to be a stronger person for my sisters, and I was the one to improve their experience growing up even though I never had anyone to improve mine. 

You can move back to the apartment when you have your bearings (key word: WHEN!) but also maintain contact with your brother, right?  Try and be that constant fixture in his life, since it’s not realistic to expect you to live there as he grows older. And remember to acknowledge that you’re literally doing everything you can do in this  moment."
mentalhealth,fpou1ul,t1_fpostr4,1588790661.0,"So you are one of the many ‘parentified children’ out there, in the sense that you felt a strong responsibility to ensure your parents’ happiness and wellbeing - to a point where it’s damaging your own happiness and well being. That must be so hard, to have all of that pressure on your shoulders from such a young age. And to assume the role of making your parent feel good and not the other way around. I’m sorry you had to have the misfortune of experiencing all of this, but there’s a side to it where you’ll come out a better and stronger person - it sounds so cliche but it’s true. In all of this is the for sure outcome that you’ll develop a resiliency that will help you tackle everything in life. I’m glad you’re on here since you can talk about things without the fear of being judged by people you know/that know you. And I’m glad you got in touch with a health care professional that can help you make the changes necessary. You’re on the right path for sure and don’t be afraid to speak your truth!"
mentalhealth,fpoqdiu,t1_fpop6gr,1588788854.0,"You’re so close to graduating so I say trudge through til the end, and a degree in math doesn’t necessarily mean a career in math.

Disappointing the father thing... I get it too. My family, having immigrated here from the Middle East, put such an emphasis on education and being smart (as a means of being successful and living up to the typical arab standards) that it’s almost crippling living up to such an expectation. 
And on the chances that you do mess up and make a mistake - cuz we are only human - it’s the most disastrous thing in the world. And you become your own worst critic, and you become so hard on yourself.

I acknowledged my mind would delve into these trains of thought, and in response I distracted myself with structure and routine. Now that COVID hit, that routine is gone and I'm left with this wandering mind. 

I guess that speaks to what you asked: ""Do I need meaningful aims in my life to pour into my energy instead of overthinking my own creation?""

We do need meaningful aims. But also, I hope we can find a way to snap out of this bad habit and live in the moment. Spend all this time looking backwards and forwards, but never being present, and in turn missing out on precious moments we can't get back"
mentalhealth,fpojv2r,t3_gemne6,1588785723.0,"Everything you're saying is resonating with me on another level, especially the anger issues part. I too had that problem growing up, and constantly have fell back into the hole of anxiety and depression. It is such an insidious thing, taking you into a state of hopelessness and despair before you realize it... I continue to deal with it too.

I'm just a couple years older than you (23F) and I finished college (I'm assuming you're American but us Canadians call it university lol) but I was in the exact same position you were in, and the one thing I can tell you for a fact is that this college experience is all temporary, as much as it feels like forever. That being said, you say you are smart but that you don't focus and you procrastinate. Maybe this is because you're studying something you're not interested in? And this isn't a testament to your own shortcomings - struggling in school - but rather the unavoidable outcome of trying to succeed at something that simply doesn't move you. It's hard to ask these questions but what do you truly want out of life, what inspires you? Figuring this out could prove to be a source of happiness. Sticking to what YOU deeply and inherently enjoy, something that feeds your soul. You're the one that lives with yourself at the end of the day, don't do what you believe will please others when it comes to schooling or career,  be 'selfish' in a way and do things for yourself. That's the most important thing, recognizing and prioritizing your needs.

Secondly, as much as you have to acknowledge the issues in yourself and the problems you are dealing with, you also gotta practice self-compassion. You are doing something so difficult, and that's trying to function and take care of your well being by reminding/forcing yourself to eat and sticking with school. Think of the amazing characteristics in yourself, the good qualities. I've been this low before, I know how bleak and awful that it makes everything seem. The way it colors everything in your life a shade or two darker. It's a positive feedback loop, bad thoughts lead to more bad thoughts. You're addressing the problems, now its time to find the solution. It's so good that you're actively seeking out therapy, because this will also help you work through everything.

My last point I want to touch on is also relying on your support system, whether its parents or friends - we all need one. That mental breakdown you mentioned - which happened to me right before I went to write my MCAT - is a warning sign that you've reached your limit. I get being that happy friend, not wanting to be a downer, but friends are there for both the good and the bad, that's the agreement right. Use this moment to re-orient yourself and to fall back on having the people around you who care for you, to help you through this difficult period in your life. They can remind you of your good qualities that you yourself forget, they can provide clarity on the situation. Things that rattle around in our head always seem bigger than they truly are. You *will* get through this, I know it, because you've clearly fought on this long. However, this isn't a sustainable way of being - take it from someone who truly knows. Talk to those around you, let them know how you're feeling so that you can have that support system necessary to get through this rough patch, on top of seeking out a psychologist. Different solutions work for different people, I found comfort in watching youtube videos about this very thing and reading books on anxiety and depression. But I realize just because this works for me doesn't mean it works for everybody. You can figure it out and try these things, see what works for you and what you need.

Overall, these negative feelings in ourselves need some sort of an outlet, like talking to friends and family or finding a hobby - a way to express oneself like writing or painting or even going for walks or runs, listening to music. That'll diffuse the tension just enough so that you can really understand the underlying problems.

I'm only talking from the experience I've had, growing up as an anxious kid wasn't fun and I'm sure you can agree. But you're not alone, and as much as it feels like the world is punishing you and you only, so many of us have been there and there are multitudes of resources out there to help people like us. Not all hope is lost.

&#x200B;

Side note: I am completely not 'math-inclined' (I got C's in the most introductory calculus course for life sciences) so kudos to you for even surviving such a major. I realize that the inability to excel at a certain subject doesn't mean you're incapable all around either. We all have our strengths and weaknesses, its just all about identifying them and working through it all.

&#x200B;

EDIT: I'm sorry I missed the part where you tried talking to your parents and you felt judged. It seems like they want whats best for you but they're not equipped to effectively deal with what's coming at them. You have friends who Im certain can relate on some level, since we are living in such a unique time that some individuals in older generations don't fully understand."
