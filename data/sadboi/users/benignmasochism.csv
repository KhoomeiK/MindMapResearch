AskEconomics,fq6ogza,t1_fq57qvg,1589135470.0,"Of course! I did my honors thesis on UI benefits, and there a lot of papers that I found useful. These are the ones that come to mind regarding match quality. 

Theoretical papers:

1. [Marimon and Zilibotti (1999)](https://www.nber.org/papers/w6038.pdf) present a model on UI and mismatch. They demonstrate UI reduces skill mismatch
2. [Acemoglu and Shimer (2000)](https://www.nber.org/papers/w7352.pdf) show that UI increases labor productivity when workers are risk averse. Workers look for higher-productivity jobs when given UI. UI also encourages firms to create these jobs. 

Empirical Papers:

1. [Centeno, (2004)](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/5d5a/f515a115d2e341f26d1dfe84dc5a7a8990ab.pdf?_ga=2.89380315.1551948479.1589135010-283909422.1580823229) uses NLSY data over time. Finds that UI results in better matches in terms of tenure of job and wages. The jobs that people find are less likely to dissolve.
2. [Kugler and Farooq (2018) ](https://lacea-lames2017.exordo.com/files/papers/699/initial_draft/UI_Mismatch_Kugler_Farooq_052517.pdf) use CPS data to analyze UI in the US after the Great Recession. They find that extending UI increases wages and reduces separations in the first year after exiting unemployment.
3. [Belzil (2001)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2109997?seq=1) uses Canadian data after a reduction in the initial entitlement period rule. Finds a weak but positive impact of the maximum benefit duration on job duration."

AskEconomics,fq42xd9,t3_ggqsz3,1589073061.0,"I think unemployment insurance (UI) benefits are commonly misunderstood.

1. Unemployed people are not doing ""nothing""; they're looking for work. Benefits expire after a said period of time. UI benefits are meant to smooth consumption while you're looking for a job.
2. There's evidence that UI improves the quality of your search. People with benefits find jobs that they are better-qualified for, have higher wages, and/or longer tenure. This is good for the labor market because it means the right people are being matched with the right job, and increases what we call ""match quality"".
3. Human capital (like skills) are occupation specific i.e. people are good at what they do. There's a lot of research demonstrating that exogenous (as in random) occupation switches lead to long term loss in wage prospects and job quality. Forcing unemployed people to switch occupations/ learn something unrelated to their field when they could be spending their time and resources into finding a good job would lead to overall loss in productivity.
4. You only qualify for UI if you've been laid off due to no fault of your own. It could be the business was shutdown, there was a natural disaster, etc. It is unwarranted to ask these people to take up additional costs (which could be many and varied) to switch trades, even temporarily.

Hope that helps!"
gradadmissions,fq2budq,t1_fq28zz4,1589054651.0,"I would second that. A lot of colleges (including mine) allow students to do an Honors Thesis even if they're not in the Honors program. I applied at the end of my junior year through my department, got to do a thesis, and graduated with high honors despite not having taken any honors classes. Would definitely look into it, OP!"
