mentalhealth,fr69wfm,t3_gmt8ka,1589922477.0,"I struggle a lot with this. I'm currently in therapy and am working through things, this included. It sounds like maybe learning about self compassion would be a good idea. Try letting go of how 'good' the things you create are should be and just practice enjoying the process. I highly recommend reading 'the gifts of imperfection' by brene brown."
sloths,fr4nxw9,t1_fr4h859,1589893166.0,Yes :D thats exactly where I was!
mentalhealth,fr1k42s,t3_gm40fd,1589821106.0,Sounds like those are your go-to comfort strategies for dealing with stress. I do something similar but sub youtube for Sims and add in a lot of pot.

Sims4,fr0zcr8,t3_glw4hh,1589810147.0,I've basically given up owning cats or dogs in game. Even just the walking a dog timers are off. There is no way in heck it should take a sim 6 hours to take the dog on a short walk. The only time I have a dog in game is if I make their traits to include lazy and independent and that takes the stress of walking them away

mentalhealth,fr095e2,t1_fr08p70,1589787633.0,I started to really love it after about a month of doing it regularly. Sometimes I wont meditate for a couple weeks and I can feel it in my body. This past year its started to be the first thing I do when very anxious but I'm a slow learner haha
mentalhealth,fr08uv6,t3_gls8vu,1589787362.0,"Honestly, I'm a 35f  from a similar background and a lot of my friends have had it rough. The only way I have found is therapy for trauma, learning healthy self care and coping mechanisms, having healthy habits. If you avoid those 3, you're going to be miserable for years. I did. I would find happiness for a bit, but the old sad would kick in. Dont wait till your 30 to start. Start healing now. Break the cycle."

Dogtraining,fqtk9kk,t3_gkv197,1589640651.0,"I always interpreted it as being territorial. My dog does this too, shes 10. It always stops after a few months but I have to take her back to the basics and retrain her until she gets the point when I move in with someone new. It's super annoying. She also does it at other peoples houses, especially if they have dogs. Its embarrassing. I have to plan outings so she doesnt have a poop in her, and watch her like a hawk."
mentalhealth,fqthqmf,t3_gksk39,1589639236.0,"I always thought I was alone or some kind of failure because of this. Its nice to know that other people experience this as well. I'm on an upswing at the moment. I dont have a diagnosis, my counselor says that even if I did have a diagnosis, the treatment I'm doing would be the recommended treatment anyway. Shes a trauma specialist, but cannot prescribe meds. I take antidepressants but i dont think they work. I've just started microdosing mushrooms, but its only been a week. I dont know how I feel because work has been shit and I'm super anxious about it.  Self care comes and goes in waves for me. I know what's good for me and when I'm depressed I dont do any of it. I just binge eat, smoke a ton of pot, disengage from everyone, and play the sims for 18  hours straight for days. Counsellor says theres a part of me that wants to numb when I'm depressed  so we are trying to work with it in the next few sessions. I've named that part 'No' and getting to know her.  Right now I'm putting together a self care box. I told my fiance that when he sees me starting to be sad, he can remind me about the box. Idk... I'm trying..."

Its squishy and nice to play with. Do you meditate? I'd stick a little thing in there to remind me to do that, like a chakra bracelet or a little buddha. Maybe a favourite essential oil? I like orange scents to cheer me up. Maybe a nice book? A notebook for thoughts? Oh wow! You got my brain going :)"
AmItheAsshole,fqe7owp,t3_gi1zfq,1589303103.0,"Sometimes these traits are actually representative of an undiagnosed mental health issues. For instance,I went through that in my 20s.

mentalhealth,fqduluc,t3_gian17,1589296872.0,"I was lucky, I did some research and her online profile spoke to me, the initial call was comforting, we just hit it off right away. I only had telephone therapy before her. Some of my friends refuse to go to therapy because they have gone once, and didnt like their therapist. Part of me wonders if it's because being vulnerable is incredibly difficult, and changing is terrifying. So rather than continue, they place blame on the therapist."
mentalhealth,fqdfund,t3_gi3lds,1589288739.0,"Just my opinion, but social media is a curse. I've never been a snap chatter (I'm old and not tech savvy) but I've been a facebooker and Instagram, and  those made me sad too, because it's too easy to compare myself with what others are doing or not doing and I always felt left out. So I just stopped using them. I'm finding I'm having more meaningful interactions on reddit. It just sucks cause that doesnt solve  the whole loneliness aspect. Do you play online games? Sometimes that's helped me feel less lonely. Sometimes I've literally texted my friends  saying, 'hey I have nothing to say but I was thinking about you' and then we talked for a bit. Sometimes reaching out first helps."
mentalhealth,fqb0q2x,t3_ghpmrq,1589228555.0,"Meditation helps me too, to break the thought pattern. I use the app Calm. I also say out loud 'no!this is not true!' To help me stop the thought train.

TrueOffMyChest,fpju42m,t3_gdsxv8,1588681039.0,"Further to this: stop telling me that no one will love me unless I love myself. That's not a helpful to say.  I'm working on it, and if someone has never been made to feel worthy as a child, it's not easy. It's not a switch that I can turn on. Plenty of people love me, thank you very much.

'Oh thank you, grand saviour, what a relief! You've saved me by invading my privacy and destroying my favourite thing!' YTA. And FYI, when I get right obsessed with a game, its cause I'd prefer to distract myself from reality. She ain't happy, and likely you are one of the reasons."
mentalhealth,fp42m2n,t3_gb6kuf,1588290458.0,"Not exactly those phrases but I empathize with you. I've always been described as 'too much' 'a bulldozer' 'sensitive, too emotional' but I sympathize with what you're feeling because my parents were mentally ill and not good parents at all. So as an adult, seeing a therapist, I'm gaining a small amount of love for myself because my therapist explained a lot of the descriptions to me.  You're not alone OP"
AmItheAsshole,fp414tt,t3_gayy11,1588289640.0,"YTA OP and you're lucky that your gf is only 23 and will likely put up with this behaviour and take you back. Hopefully shes got some smart friends that are cheering her on to drop your ass. If you had taken her doses of gabapentin and codeine instead, and she decided to call the cops regarding you stealing her medication, they'd have something to say to you for sure. You're on the path to  becoming an abuser, OP. Probably should get some therapy and sort your fucking head."

My friends parents would teach me how to care for myself. The dentist explained how to care for my teeth. My grandma would teach me how to clean. People showed me how to cook. Plus- the internet helps. My brother is 10 years younger than me (24) and still lives with my mom. He doesnt know how to practice hygiene.

Often they would take me on adventures that my parents wouldn't have because they prioritized drugs and alcohol over their children. I have a therapist, but I would have been lost without those people.
