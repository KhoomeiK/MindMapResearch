All I can tell y'all about is the suicide that changed my openion on the whole thing... permanently. 

When I was a bartender, mind you that bartending is 1/3 drug dealer, 1/3 temporary best friend, and 1/3 your psychologist (most of the time, anyway), and in this ""temporary best friend"" role, a lot of struggling souls enter, and exit your life in rapid succession, but there is one customer that I will never be able to forget...

I first started recognizing her for her odd name that was indecipherable to me at the time from just the spelling on her CC, and her... it wasn't really a ""resting b face"", but more of a resting ""Omfg y'all are fucking idiots"" face... her disgust was plainly evident almost at all times, but as I was to learn later, I think a lot of that was just self-disgust, and a natural disgust for the society which had caused her to suffer so greatly.

She was a woman with a sort of natural classical beauty, but seemed to be caught in a feed-back loop of being depressed over her body image, and then over ""comfort eating"" because of it, which was the main problem with her body image in the first place, and the cycle repeated endlessly... a prisoner of her own mind, and of her own form. Viciously attacking herself, because of her ""self""...

She became very close friends with a lot of my very closest friends, and we went to a lot of the same parties and events, but I never really got to know her more than as a customer, and casual acquaintance, but I distinctly remember going to her place with my BFF, and her just casually pointing out that she leaves her dildos strewn all around haphazardly, and to watch where I sat.  (heheh) She was a naturally gifted comedian, as I think comedians are often two things, Intelligent, and dissatisfied, and I've seen her stand-up routine, and although it was very unkind to herself, it was also hilarious. I'd link it if I didn't feel it would be massively inappropriate in this context, anyway...

One day she decided to ""Exit Stage Left""... permanently... and this is the point when this story stops being about her, but my very closest (mutual) friends...

As I watched the news flow to each of them...

**It Fucking DESTROYED Them.**  like... the people I cared about most in my life... they were Fucking ANNIHILATED by her decision... 

People started walking around in a haze, and randomly breaking down into an inconsolable weeping heap Anytime they remembered her... for **MONTHS**...

It was at least Half A Year before my friend-circle could put this behind them, and her poor family... they will Never be able to put this behind them.

All of us continually had the same recurring thought... ... ""What could *I* have done?! What didn't I say or do that could have saved her?! Why did I let this Happen?!?!""

It was an Emotional Plague on All our houses. A tormented soul tormenting others by removing herself permanently from our lives, and slamming the door on the way out.

After directly observing this horrible tragedy, and the suffering it caused, I made a decision to Never follow her through that Exit. I couldn't bear the thought of hurting other people like that ever... again.

Study the total *impermanence* and *imperfection* inherent in all phenomena in the universe. The only constant is change.

In other words...

Desperation is unattractive. Dont be desperate to have something, and be an adult about not getting what you want all the time. Like... just accept things As They Are, and move past the blockage.

Do not idealize perfection in anything, because all things change, and nothing is perfect for very long. Accept that perfection is impossible, and accept things As They Are.

ShrugLifeSyndicate,fm9naaw,t3_ftpnr9,1585872258.0,"I'm actually Mathlexic (official diagnosis of Learnig Disability in Math), which like Dyslexia, is Not as much of a *disability* as much as it is just a less common Brain-Wireing from birth that means you Learn *Differently* than our modern school systems are designed to instruct students with. The only DISABILITY here is with the fact that Modern Public Schools are a retrofitting of and old Prussian Military Academy with an outstanding record of crafting perfect obedient Soldiers  out of little kids, and in America that system was redesigned to produce obedient Workers, and Wage-Slaves... no joke tho.  🤬!!!

So I was never taught Math in the way my brain is designed to Learn It (!) So despite an above average I.Q., and always being in ""Gifted"" classes, I also spent every year in the disabled classes for math and reading/writing for my dyslexia.

Anyway, I'm no help with Maths, but u/SightOfBirds actually IS gifted in math, and has tutored ppl in it, so maybe drop her a DM if you get stuck with a math problem.  <#"
