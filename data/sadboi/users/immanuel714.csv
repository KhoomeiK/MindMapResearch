marketing,foibyon,t3_g7ltgp,1587783133.0,I know you can install wordpress through CPanel. I would imagine that would be how the plugins are used. The more unlikely version is taking the plugin code I think.

LilPeep,fj8isxj,t3_fc4jxb,1583114383.0,Honestly my first portrait in about a decade. Just recently got into Peep and I was blown away and inspired me to get back into it. I'm planning on scanning it in tomorrow but I wanted to at least snap a pic.
millionairemakers,fep60ac,t3_eq81a8,1579312906.0,Fortune and health to all!

Allergies,f176i9w,t1_f174oxw,1569237036.0,"They did this new test that was like a game where I blew into it to get a good score, then they did a breathing treatment on me and had me do it again. They then told me I had asthma and sent me off. I was on medication for a while along with an inhaler but the psychological effects were way too much and took myself off of them.

Right now I'm struggling due to the humid hot weather when it's supposed to be more fall-like. I was great weeks ago and then this heatwave hit me like a ton of bricks."
Allergies,f158bn3,t1_f14yrtc,1569186151.0,The first one mentioned is what I was on. I thought I would be in the clear for days not taking it but I've heard the smallest amount can really affect.
Allergies,f157w1m,t1_f14z2ld,1569185982.0,"In general they were very offputting and rude and no doctor should make you feel dumb. Also, I know allergies can change but having a decent amount to none whatsoever makes no sense.

I was suspicious so I went to their Google reviews and plenty complained about their rudeness so I know not to go back."
Allergies,f14tf2u,t1_f14sj51,1569180420.0,"It's always been my left ear and nose, and my face will feel tight. I wheeze occasionally and that's when I know to use my inhaler. They told me my ear may be from a sinus infection that never went away and that I should get an x-ray - but I've had this issue for years and actually had that done with nothing to show for it and they wouldn't listen. I had asthma when I was a baby (and told them this) and it went into remission in grade school. I think they assumed that I knew how to use an inhaler"
Allergies,f14ovwp,t3_d7l2gw,1569178549.0,I had the same problems and had to take myself off of it. It made me feel crazy with depression and anxiety
AskReddit,ez7tuin,t1_ez3jrdn,1567728320.0,"I actually read some major signs on ADHD and I felt I ticked all the boxes. My emotions always feel rampant, my senses can be pretty strong, and I suffer from anxiety like crazy. Thinking I may bring it up at my next appointment."
Anxiety,exd01fr,t1_exck1p1,1566163861.0,I think that's what's frustrating. I thought I had mentioned I had anxiety but if this brand has a black label I would've thought that I would be warned.
Anxiety,ewm11q3,t3_cow80o,1565540689.0,This was so needed. Thank you so much.
Anxiety,ewk9znt,t3_cokwpv,1565479045.0,I absolutely get this. My mind goes to the assumption 'well if you're happy that must mean something bad is going to happen' and it forces me into this miserable state
Anxiety,evwyyf8,t3_cloaf2,1564877204.0,"Absolutely. The last few weeks have been hell for me. Last few weekends I got the same feelings and issues would arise at work and I thought it was my subconscious letting me know something was wrong, but in reality it was coincidental. I feel a bit this way this weekend but there's literally nothing to worry about and it's driving me crazy."
AskReddit,ev3st0e,t3_cia06j,1564201221.0,"Tons of debt would be eradicated, and I would finally be able to breathe and not have constant stress and anxiety."
spicy,euxuqia,t1_euum3kj,1564091970.0,"Sure:

1-1/2 peaches chopped 
1 plum chopped
5 dried ghost peppers 
1/4 cup vinegar/citrus mix (apple cider/1 orange)
1/2 cup Brown sugar or more to taste
Ground ginger (I used a lot. It is to taste)
Ghost pepper powder

I put all the chopped fruit and ghost peppers in a blender to mix, while slowly adding the vinegar mixture. 

I then added the brown sugar and ground ginger. I like a lot of ginger so I added a lot and then some by taste. I had some ghost pepper powder on hand and added a bit in.

I'm not a cook by any means, so I dabbed a little bit of 2 hot sauces for an extra kick.

Next time I want to use actual peppers and a more potent ginger, and really fresh fruit. This stuff creeps up bit I think actual peppers will make it hotter."

dayton,euc5gi8,t1_euc1exp,1563665583.0,"I was planning on calling Monday to be safe. I can't believe there's nothing on the weekends.

I dont understand the door-to-door sales tactic anyways. It's not the 50's anymore. Nobody likes strangers asking about stuff like that."
dayton,euanbno,t1_eua3rpm,1563626029.0,The supplier salesmen kept coming every day to our house and my husband had to get aggressive with his words and tell them to leave. Wondering if that could be it. We actually called them to complain.
dayton,eua3gl2,t1_eua262q,1563599621.0,"That makes sense. I was a bit paranoid because my power is out, but I'm one of 3000 in the area. It wouldn't even let me pay anything and kept saying I didn't owe anything.

Quick edit: power came on. Way too hot for this crap"

WTF,epmyoit,t1_eplwmdl,1559319015.0,Agreed. My husband had to get his fixed and there was so many issues that it ended up costing 1200 to get a full replacement of his AC.
indesign,eounp73,t1_eotp2k6,1558875093.0,"That's what I'll probably do. I packaged it and sent it to onedrive to have on my personal computer to see any changes. So far all is well, which has me thinking it's the backing system. Those files were in my local drive due to the large size."
indesign,eoqkl7l,t1_eoqjbgm,1558793299.0,"I wish that were the issue, but I had not packaged the file just yet so I only had 1 copy.

I did however package the file, put it in a place to where I could download it on my personal computer and work to see what was going on and I'm having no issues whatsoever.

Our work computers get backed up all the time and I'm wondering if maybe that could be the issue, but I'm really not sure what's causing this. It's happened with multiple files I've worked with."
