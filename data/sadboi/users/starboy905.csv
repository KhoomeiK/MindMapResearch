BipolarReddit,fb983py,t3_ebzjbx,1576631801.0,I checked in at a hotel on a road trip once that I was convinced was the hotel from The Shining. I stayed up all night and locked/relocked the doors because I thought I could hear Jack laughing and running around in my hallway. I was completely convinced that I had been placed in the Kubrick movie on accident. It was terrible. I didn't stay in hotels for a month.

callmebyyourname,f0zjvpe,t3_d7bv6e,1569097103.0,I think the connection between ancient (and homoerotic) statues and Elio and Oliver‚Äôs relationship is very strong. It‚Äôs like Luca/Andr√© are reminding us of how natural their love is. It‚Äôs almost like they‚Äôve met in a past life. I think it definitely shows that gay love has always been natural.
