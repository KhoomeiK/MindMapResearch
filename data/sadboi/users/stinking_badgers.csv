This mixture of cultural and institutional forbearance varies from area to area within each state, as you say, but the wider national culture gives them room to flex in ways and to degrees that other places with stricter police oversight and different civilian expectations of police behavior might not accept.

Journalism,fq1exam,t1_fpeppyf,1589045043.0,"A couple of thoughts: 
Different publications have different rules in terms of crediting styles. Most will run the credit right alongside the image. A scholarly pub or book might list all credits with the end notes. 
Most will credit the photographer name/agency or organization: Jane Smith/Getty Images, for example. If it’s just a solo person or organization, print that: Jane Smith. Or Library of Congress, etc. Sometimes people also like a link to their original site if they want to help you but don’t feel like it should be totally for free. That’s something you can offer in negotiation. 
Some publications don’t credit at all; I think that they should. 
As others have pointed out, permission is absolutely key. You’ve mentioned you’re hoping to use public domain or Creative Commons images, which shows you are trying to do the ethical thing. That’s much appreciated. The risk factor however is that unfortunately anyone can grab any image, whether public or not, and upload it under a free use heading. Your best bet is to really research.

When a black person is pulled over for no apparent reason, they can't prove it was because of racism. But they have a reasonable cause to at least suspect it among the reasons.
