Some even started following me around, and yes they were not happy (regardless of what u/PM-ME-UR-PERKY-BOOBZ seems to think). 

Do some research on lucid dreaming, it's something I think everyone should become proficient at. And there is vast amounts of information about the wild ways dream characters react before you have significant control over LD. Shit, even after you have confidence in your dreams things can still get interesting. That's when you go on dream sequence vision quests to get to the bottom of what your subconscious is trying to tell you...
