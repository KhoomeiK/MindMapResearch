ddlg,f5nz9q3,t3_doh17a,1572306555.0,"NAH. You’re allowed to be upset. But honestly, do you expect him to keep his mic off and only turn it on before he says something...? Keeping it on through the game seems normal, he can’t control when you speak out to him but he could have mentioned that his mic was on, but I don’t think he’s in the wrong. He’s also hanging out with friends per se, just through a computer so think of it that way."
