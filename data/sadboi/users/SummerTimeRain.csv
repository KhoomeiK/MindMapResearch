3rd night i was half out of it and realized i was just dozing for hours and not really asleep. Also i had an erection, thought it was normal and i just layed on it and got it going, and then over the course of the night realized  it wasnt going away and i had it for over 5 hours.

Never took it again.

residentevil,fnv0l2p,t3_g41d6v,1587276403.0,"Honestly, i have loved the remakes of 2 and 3 immensely. But 7 was straight up horror. That was a hard game for me to play, and also something i enjoyed immensely.

Gameplay wise i enjoyed the 2 remake the best but 2 and 3 were still pretty actiony.

I think RE7 did bring it back to its roots, was fresh. The VR mode is terrifying. Probably the best VR i've seen for psvr so far. Even just the option to use tv or vr.

I'm a bit twisted, because I don't want Resi8 to follow the remakes paths, and be more horror oriented, but 7 was so different from the rest of the series, but i want to see it evolve a bit more.

Ya man, honestly, i don't know. But i'm super excited to see what they do next."

Super is really great. I like to describe it as Z without the BS. The fights don't take forever to start and the actual fights are really well choreographed. They messed with the power levels a lot though. Like how Tien and Roshi were pretty much useless early on in Z, they *kinda* retconned the big power level differences and gave everyone their strengths.
