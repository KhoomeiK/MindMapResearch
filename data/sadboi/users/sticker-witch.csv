BorderlinePDisorder,fhf3j1a,t1_fhf1jdt,1581535481.0,"You‚Äôre welcome!! 

Ahhh lol, I‚Äôve been there!!! That obsessive feeling is so awful, like ‚Äúcome on, just do the thing I want and everything will be perfect, why are you doing this to me??‚Äù My therapist once told me that feeling so intensely towards people (like that instant intense connection) signifies how desperately we want to connect with others, and so we can kind of jump the gun. Whenever I feel things intensely, I try to validate how I feel, like ‚Äúit‚Äôs understandable that I‚Äôm excited about this person because I thought we had a great time, it‚Äôs understandable that I feel upset and obsessive now because I don‚Äôt know what happened and I feel like I don‚Äôt have control‚Äù and then yeah, recognizing that dwelling on it is only going to cause you more discomfort and pain (even tho for me it always feels like that‚Äôs the solution). It sucks to shake your self loose, but letting go is so freeing. In situations like this, I avoid checking Instagram, or read old messages  etc, because it‚Äôs only going to give the obsession more fuel. Get it out of sight, and then cram your brain full of other pleasant stimuli. Eventually, he‚Äôll fade away. 

Also, try to learn from this experience :) I have a bad habit of doing the same thing...I‚Äôd get excited about someone and start planning our whole lives together and how great it would be; and then if things don‚Äôt work, it would be even more devastating. Now, when I catch myself having thoughts like that, I validate the urge, like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm exited and it‚Äôs understandable that I am because I like this person for these reasons‚Äù and then I  don‚Äôt let myself go there. It‚Äôs been challenging, but the more I do it, the easier it‚Äôs getting. The obsession etc doesn‚Äôt happen as much when there isn‚Äôt that source material for it."
BorderlinePDisorder,fheyzs3,t1_fhex8sp,1581532800.0,"This is my instinct too. As for staying rational: try to remember that sometimes people‚Äôs choices have nothing to do with you, and try to focus on letting go of control over a situation you can‚Äôt control; you can‚Äôt control his actions, but you can control your own :) focus on doing good things for yourself; when I‚Äôm feeling unhinged or obsessive over other people, I try to circle back and do something to ‚Äústrengthen‚Äù myself; putting the energy I‚Äôm wasting (on other people) back into myself by doing chores, hobbies, whatever that will make my life a better place. Even if it doesn‚Äôt feel ‚Äúgood‚Äù in the moment, in the long term it‚Äôs investing in your own well being.

If you don‚Äôt even have access to that though...I‚Äôm so sorry. 

Believe me, I feel your frustration and I wish I could give you a simple answer. It‚Äôs unfair and f*ed up that society doesn‚Äôt value healthcare and especially mental health care the way that it should; that care is kept behind extremely high pay walls and isn‚Äôt accessible to everyone as easily as it should be. It‚Äôs not okay, and it‚Äôs not okay that you‚Äôre in a position where you feel like you have no options. Like I said, I used to fantasize about getting into accidents and hospitalized, because I felt like there truly weren‚Äôt any other options to escape how miserable I was. 

In the past I‚Äôve been able to find counselling services that were paid on a sliding scale (ended up being free for me because of how low income I was), and have also been able to find reduced cost counselling by seeing student therapists (still completing training). I‚Äôve also recently discovered free resources locally, including the DBT course I‚Äôm taking now at a local hospital.

BPD,ff97enb,t3_escvn1,1579706583.0,"Hey! You‚Äôre definitely not alone, and my heart goes out to you.

I was in the same situation...my entire adult life (basically the last decade), work has caused me extreme stress, daily panic attacks, dread, etc. I used to cry at my desk or in the bathroom, every day. I used to fantasize about getting into accidents or getting sick and hospitalized, just so I could have a valid excuse not to have to go to work. I wanted to work though, to be independent and stable and capable, to have money and live the life that I wanted to. 

I‚Äôm 30 now and have no ‚Äúcareer‚Äù to speak of, just a string of meaningless jobs that made me miserable; I was lucky to be able to receive money from EI (employment insurance) for about a year) and spent that time devoted to working on my health. When my EI ran out and I was forced to go back to work, all the negative symptoms above came right back. I tried to go back to school, to learn skills for a job I thought might make me happier...but it lead to a major breakdown instead. 

I‚Äôm now on disability and working full time on recovery. I used to also fantasize about this...but never thought I was ‚Äúsick‚Äù enough to qualify. Now that I‚Äôve been approved for it, I feel like a huge weight has been lifted from me, and I actually have the mental space to focus on getting better. I know it‚Äôs not for everyone and definitely not an easy process, but if you‚Äôve been working with a dr/team and have adequate supporting documents, it‚Äôs worth looking into.

In one of my groups, we recently discussed how holding on to some old/unhealthy behaviours can actually help us to learn new/healthier behaviours, because it helps to give you some comfort and security while trying new things. 

That being said, if looking forward to a nice breakfast brings you joy and helps you get out of bed in the morning, I say go for it! You might want to cut down on fast food/junk in general, but giving yourself permission to enjoy a coffee and bagel on morning that you could use the pick me up is most likely going to give you the comfort and mental energy you need to then make healthier choices in the rest of your day :) and when you do give yourself that permission, try to really, fully enjoy that food without any guilt or shame.

The same thing happens to me: I have supportive friends and family, and I start to get sad around the time that parties or hangouts wind down. I also feel panicky when I don‚Äôt have social plans for a few days in a row, even though I know that I have tons of people in my life that care about me.

My instincts tell me that the solution is to work harder at making people like me/want me, so that they won‚Äôt leave, and if they do leave it means that I failed somehow....but that‚Äôs unrealistic and the reality is that sometimes we all have to be alone by ourselves. I can‚Äôt change reality be denying it, so I realize that what I really need to work on is liking myself and being comfortable by myself/with only my own company. 

I‚Äôm really working at making time alone something to enjoy and not something to dread, mostly by trying to focus on things that I can do alone that I love that I can‚Äôt necessarily do when other people are around: like submersing myself in art/hobbies, singing out loud to music I like, taking a bath and painting my nails etc. Im going to have to spend time alone, I might as well learn how to enjoy it and make it pleasurable for myself (although LOL I wish it was as easy at that sounds)."

BPD,fcvm4jg,t3_ej0vnu,1578005052.0,"Hey! I‚Äôve struggled with my weight all my life, and have only just now recognized the connection between my disordered eating and my BPD (was diagnosed with both an eating disorder and BPD summer 2019). 

It sounds like you‚Äôre putting an awful lot of pressure on yourself, which in my experience is never helpful. Going on ‚Äúdiets‚Äù, even if it was just wanting to ‚Äúbe healthier and eat better‚Äù was always a huge trigger for me because it felt like so much judgement and pressure; I would always try to do too much, would burn out, and then judge and hate myself for it. 

My advice to you is to focus on adding small changes to your existing routines, and not to stress too much about not doing ‚Äúunhealthy things‚Äù.  Add a walk on days you feel up to it; eat whole/nutritious foods when you can. Holding on to some old, unhealthy patterns of behaviour (like say, eating chips) can help you feel safe/comforted enough to feel up to the challenge of trying something new (like adding a walk to your routine). 

Also, try to focus more on your personal relationship with food and how it makes you feel, as well as the relationship between how you‚Äôre feeling and what you‚Äôre eating.  Try to eat mindfully and enjoy things. If I want a treat, or some comfort food, I have it and I pay attention to it while I eat so that my brain actually processes that enjoyment and it registers. I‚Äôve been finding this really helpful! 

Sleep too is huge; I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs one of the first things to try and improve, because not being well rested will make everything so much more challenging. 

Hope some of this was helpful!"

BPD,fazy5hx,t3_eax203,1576420714.0,I‚Äôm proud of you too! This is such a huge thing to realize and will only help you move towards healing. My brain has recently been discovering things like this (that seem logical now but I never fully understood) and it‚Äôs life-changing.
BPDsupport,faowufj,t3_ea09qi,1576274407.0,"Hey there! I‚Äôm also polyamorous and have BPD, so I feel you on how challenging it can be. If you‚Äôd like to chat ever, feel free to message me :)"
BorderlinePDisorder,fairq2k,t1_fair1ll,1576115050.0,Anytime  :)
BorderlinePDisorder,faipua1,t3_e9ecrh,1576113750.0,Thank you for sharing this üíñ I‚Äôm in very similar circumstances and appreciate knowing I‚Äôm not alone.
BorderlinePDisorder,f7megki,t3_dwy0sk,1573861110.0,"I‚Äôve been going through something similar lately...I‚Äôve been feeling so alone that spending a night by myself makes me feel panicky. I have an amazing partner and friends, but can‚Äôt get (and shouldn‚Äôt reasonably expect) the level of attention that my BPD wants. I understand that people have their own lives, but it doesn‚Äôt make me feel less alone."
BorderlinePDisorder,f76jrh8,t3_duei3b,1573428852.0,I feel this üíñ
BorderlinePDisorder,f72nohm,t3_du7k73,1573370505.0,"I have BPD and have (unfortunately) been in your boyfriend‚Äôs position. It sounds to me like maybe he‚Äôs having times when he‚Äôs feeling insecure about the relationship and wants reassurance...but it going about it in the wrong way. (I‚Äôve done this A LOT). 

If you haven‚Äôt already, I would recommend talking about things at an neutral time when you‚Äôre both in a clear/calm state of mind. Reasoning and rationality are usually out the window during a meltdown (for me at least). Be honest about your feelings, and give him space to reply, and make it about supporting each other and moving forward. It‚Äôll hopefully help with understanding what/how he‚Äôs feeling, and he can think about why he has those feelings, and see if there‚Äôs anything he/you can do to meet those needs. Making  a plan together that y‚Äôall can follow when things get escalated might also be a good idea (like, when I feel overwhelmed or explosive, I need time to myself, listen to music, go for a walk etc etc). In moments of crisis, you can refer to the plan together and it‚Äôll hopefully help things play out more smoothly. 

That being said...if it does feel like abuse to you, I think it‚Äôs important to do what‚Äôs best for you and your wellbeing.  

Feel free to DM me if you like."
BorderlinePDisorder,f6xqrjb,t3_dtixxe,1573255921.0,"I can really relate to this‚Äî feeling blindsided sometimes (especially when people cancel plans) and things getting out of hand before there‚Äôs even time to think. I‚Äôm sorry that you went through it recently. I liked your response above too...even with tons of support, putting in the work and making progress, it‚Äôs so, so hard and sometimes things happen. 

Feeling a little less alone rn, thanks üíñ"
BorderlinePDisorder,f4yty2y,t1_f4xxiv9,1571885224.0,I also really needed to read this. Thank you :)

BorderlinePDisorder,epiukhd,t3_bux341,1559243397.0,Hang in there! I‚Äôd also be miserable in a situation like that...sending you good vibes ‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®
BorderlinePDisorder,ep5zs11,t1_ep5oyvi,1559062883.0,"I‚Äôm sorry. I also isolate myself when I‚Äôm at my lowest. 

Maybe try to look at this as an opportunity to take a break from what you were doing (going out, downtown etc) and find some new places/ways to have fun, make yourself feel good and have some space from the place that makes you uncomfortable. 

And most importantly, remember that nothing lasts forever, even when it feels like it will üíñ"
BorderlinePDisorder,ep3001g,t3_btu1gy,1559015022.0,"I‚Äôm so sorry that you had such a terrible experience. 

Please try to remember that 1) you told him not to touch you, multiple times and that 2) just because you weren‚Äôt being raped, doesn‚Äôt mean you deserved to be touched against your will! 

You reacted in a difficult situation and didn‚Äôt ask for him to be beaten up by a group of other people. You can‚Äôt control what other people do."
