BPD,f85dotm,t3_dz3vzf,1574273038.0,"My mom took me to the hospital because i was suicidal and all they did was ask me question and that was it and i went home.

It really makes me NEVER want to go to the hospital."
BPD,f6y0o4o,t3_dtlsej,1573264132.0,"Head hitting is my main form of self abuse, I have been doing it since I can remember.  I can manage to hold myself back to a certain extent but then it gets to a point where I have no self control and I just start beating myself and go into a self destructive mode where I just want to find/do everything and anything I can to harm myself.

Side note: I have gotten better at controlling these things but still have improvment that can be made."
BPD,f6rgbj8,t1_f6r53j8,1573103025.0,I sent it to those I am close with so maybe they can have a better understanding if not already about my mental illness and just BPD itself.
BPD,f6rd2g5,t3_dspuar,1573100049.0,"I am in tears reading this because I literally NEVER know how to put into words my feelings and though and here they are right infront of me, all the things I wish to express about my emotions to others but just can never do because I think to much. 

This post makes me feel the most validation I have every felt and it makes me super emotional."
