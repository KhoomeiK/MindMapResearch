I didnt want to lose what we have, and I was confused why I was feeling that way towards another person. I told him that I love him truly, but he doesnt deserve to stay with me. I told him that he can break up with me and I will accept it. 

He refused to break up. He said that it was extremely heartbreaking but he s glad that I told him. He told me that emotions cant be controlled, but of course how you choose to act on it is different. We both cried so much and opened up to each other a lot of pent up feelings.

We agreed to both improve on how we treat each other and address together our issues. He only asked me to do one thing at that time, and that was to refrain speaking to that person while we sort our relationship. I agreed of course. It was a rough 6 months after that, rebuilding trust, and settling our issues.

We re on our 8th year now and I still believe that that period was a turning point and a lesson in our relationship. I can say that we are happier now, not perfect but happier. We experienced first hand why we shouldnt get too comfortable in a relationship, and of why its important to communicate.

I (26F) got out of my car and told her this is not allowed! She gave these following excuses (and what I rebutted) on why she wont move :

* We paid for this slot and I own my car (It didnt make any sense so I told her well I paid for 'a' slot also, and that's not 'yours'. It's an open parking AND this is my car too ??)
* I've been doing this for years (YES but it doesn't make it right!!)
* My husband is near (Okay, but I'm here)

We spoke to each other every single day for the past 2-3 months about her worries in life and love in general. I know she just wants someone to listen, and I did. There were times I tried helping her organize her thoughts/ feelings. She would then be okay for one day, and will have the same worry the next.

I don't blame her at all for being like this, depression and anxiety really mess with your brain.  I truly tried being there for her but I noticed that over the past few weeks our 'talks' started triggering my own depression. I am not in a good state myself and have been actively trying to battle my depression. I tried opening it up to her since we are friends, but I just get the cliche line ""It will pass, try not to think about it"", and then we go back talking about her problems.
