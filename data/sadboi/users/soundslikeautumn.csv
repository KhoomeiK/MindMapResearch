GenderCritical,fpd3ozc,t1_fp9s518,1588519174.0,"Straight men claim to avoid anything that might make them seem gay in any way. Men aren't affectionate towards other men like women are with other women. If I had to sleep in a bed with my best friend it would be no big deal at all, but I know men who would sleep standing up rather than share a king sized bed with their best friend of 30 years. 

This is why dick pics confuse me. Men (straight, gay, whatever) are completely obsessed with penis. In school so many guys would just flash their dicks not only at girls, but other guys. I think they flashed guys more than girls. This happened with so many guys all the time. I could pretty much say ""I'm going to see a dick in school this week"" and never be wrong. I never saw a girl flash another girl with her breasts in school. Not once. And I've never seen a women flash her vulva to anyone ever. 

The thought of ""I like this guy and I like my vulva so I think I'll randomly send him a picture of it!"" has NEVER entered my mind, but I've received SO MANY out of the blue dick pics throughout my life since cellphones. I once had a guy give me a Polaroid of his penis in middle school. Wtf?! 

I also find it interesting that straight men say vulvas/vaginas are ugly, weird, nasty, smell bad, etc. But dick is so beautiful to them they have to send pictures of it, pull it out on front of people, make jokes about it, name it some super masculine name, etc. constantly.

They aren't used to it because little girls aren't running around talking about their vulvas when they are children.

No matter the topic at hand some man just has to be ""the funny guy"" and make some inappropriate masturbation comment and they are usually made to disgust and shock everyone. 

I'm 31 years old now, but I remember being in the 5th or 6th grade when the boys started with their dick and fart jokes. I really hated these jokes because I thought they were immature and I hoped guys would grow out of them as they got older. Yeah right! I'm still dealing with dick jokes, sex references, ""that's what she said"", etc. crap all the time (online and off) from grown ass adult men in their 30s, 40s, and 50s.

The ""that's what she said"" joke has been so utterly beaten to death. Women have to choose our words very wisely so some dude doesn't shout ""THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID! Har har har!!!"" after she spoke. The simplest things are victim to dick/sex jokes from men. A woman can be talking about pillows and say ""I prefer them when they're firm."" THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID! Bananas ""I like them with some spots because they're sweeter."" THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID! Checking if the avocados are ready yet ""They're still really hard."" THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID!! What's even worse is when instead of ""That's what she said"" they make it personal and hit you with ""I bet you do!!"" ""I can help you with that *wink wink*""or something along those lines. Carrots ""I like the bigger ones as opposed to the baby ones"" I BET YOU DO! I've noticed they will say these things in a group setting like a get together to see how the woman reacts and get a laugh from the guys. Did she laugh? She's cool! Was she uncomfortable or roll her eyes? Prude and stuck up! No. I'm not prude nor stuck up. I'm just sick of having to be careful with how I say ANYTHING around GROWN ADULT MEN so I don't get hit with a childish dick joke. It's not funny. It's repulsive. It's not the actual joke that bothers me it's the man child who thinks dropping a dick joke around women constantly is funny that bothers me. I apologize for the wall of text.

I started using them when I was 23 (I'm 31 now) due to the irritation, discomfort, sweating, (thighs, bum, etc.), leaking and smell of commercial pads. I started my period when I was 12 and I used commercial pads until I was 23 then switched to cloth and never looked back! I have used tampons plenty of times, but I had a TSS scare when I was 17 so I just stopped using them all together. I've always changed my menstrual products in a timely manner. Probably too often so it was never a matter of my wearing commercial pads for too many hours. No matter the size, absorbency or brand they always caused many issues for me. I was weirded out by the idea of cloth until I caved and finally bought some. They were absolutely LIFE CHANGING!! No more chaffing, rashes, weird smells, sweating, leaking, discomfort, nothing! There's a learning curve when it comes to cleaning, washing and drying them and every women has a different method she uses to care for her cloth pads. There are endless blogs and videos on YouTube describing different cleaning methods. There are many different sizes, colors, patterns, fabrics, absorbency levels, etc. in the cloth pad world! I mainly buy from Etsy, but there are many places to get them. My favorite fabric (especially for overnight and heavy days) is minky! The softest, snuggliest and most comfortable thing ever! Lol! Fabric pads also breathe WORLDS BETTER than commercial pads. Once you get the swing of things using cloth is a breeze! Just note that warm water sets blood stains and only use cool or cold water to clean the pads and use low heat to dry them. They honestly really are great."

I used tampons during the day at school only and pads while I was home and at night. I stopped using tampons all together when I was about 17. I never got used to the idea of something sitting inside of my vagina that was absorbing everything. It felt unnatural and I was always afraid of getting TSS no matter how often I changed my tampon. I used commercial pads only until I was about 23 when I switched to cloth pads. Commercial pads were always uncomfortable and I'd get rashes and irritation on my thighs, anus and vulva from using them I found out (though my own trial and error) there is something in many commercial pads that disagrees with my skin that caused these issues. It wasn't an issue with not changing them enough. I changed them VERY often, tried different brands, etc. They were also always horribly uncomfortable to me, weren't as absorbent, etc. to me. I just never liked them. Once I began using cloth pads these issues never happened again. Not once! I do use menstrual cups on VERY rare occasions, but cloth pads are my go to. It took a while to wrap my mind around using reusable cloth pads, but I got in the swing of things quickly, did tons of research, tried different types and I'll NEVER ABSOLUTELY NEVER go back to tampons or commerical pads. Ever. Minky pads are my favorite. Minky fabric is the most comfortable, soft, absorbent and luxurious fabric on this green Earth! LOL! I also HATED the way commercial pads smelled after they were used. Cloth pads? Zip, zero nada weird smells! I've never leaked in them, minky doesn't stain easily, is WAY more comfortable, cloth breathes MUCH better. Also there are ENDLESS colors, patterns, sizes, fabrics to choose from.
