By contrast, there are half a dozen references to ""Karen"" in this post alone.

You are being disingenuous. You are well aware that when a woman is assertive, a large proportion of the Internet's males will crow ""Karen!!!"" where if a man exhibits the same behaviour, absolutely nobody is going to say ""Robert"" or ""Kevin"". 

I wonder why you're so invested in denying that the trope is sexist. It's not mature to be so entrenched in an incorrect position simply because you don't like women pointing out sexism.

Edit:

Further: 

> you are convinced men are not critiqued as well.

I didn't say this. Why do you think I said this? I am saying that a significant majority of the time women will receive the ""Karen"" insult for behaviour that goes unremarked upon when men exhibit it. I'm sorry you're confused by what the term ""sexist"" means."
