That's just a fact. It'd be one thing if I was living a perfectly healthy lifestyle but still felt like I was ill or dying all the time. I KNOW that I'm doing most things wrong health wise. None of my grandparents made it to 70. So add in my health, genetics, a heaping helping of hypochondria and you got the walking dead. 

I know my perceptions are clearly off and to the extreme, however, that still doesn't explain all the legitimate physical symptoms I regularly feel that cause my head to go to these extreme explanations. Hypochondria even runs in the family, my aunt's been dying for decades! I go through periods of extreme adherence to healthy lifestyles then eventually fall off it and start drinking, eating like shit, and not exercising.

In a sort of strange way that I'm almost ashamed of, I sort of *wish* that I was seen as ""more autistic"" than I am. Good people seem to be almost immediately understanding of a person who *they* can readily tell is autistic. I've done this my whole life when I've run into someone who has a harder time suppressing these traits. I almost wish I didn't have the ability to mask so well sometimes as it might cause less confusion in people who don't understand autism.

However, I also realize that, unfortunately, if I *wasn't* so good at masking, I would've missed out on many different friendships and social opportunities. Straight up. It's not pretty but that's just a solid fact. I've been able to do better in the world of NT people because I can fake being ""normal"" to the point of appearing more ""normal"" than most ""normal"" people lol (that is, so long as I have the energy to do so because when it's gone all bets are off)."
autism,fpxxnqp,t1_fpxoet6,1588991701.0,"We all got our experiential doppelgangers out there lol. Very relatable. The only people I've started that process of explaining and dispelling misconceptions with is my immediate family and one of my best friends. While they're all very accepting, I still think they're a ways away from truly *understanding*, assuming that's even possible. So far, their acceptance has been good enough for now. I think it was made easier because I've already gone through that process with being diagnosed with ADHD at 23, another major ""aha"" moment in my life that seemed to put so much into perspective. 

Most people who know me are aware of my ADHD and I've made some great progress in helping people around me to understand it (many people were initially skeptical of my ADHD as well because most likely picture a loud and obnoxious elementary school kid). Autism has become one of my special interests and I doubt I can ever really expect other people, especially neurotypicals who've known me as just another neurotypical person, to even begin to scratch the surface of knowledge someone like me would have. 

As for the ""stereotypically autistic"" remark, I agree. I put it in quotes because that's simply the way most NTs would likely describe it based on what I've heard over the years. I like the phrase you just said about the body being an extension of your heart. I almost want to call it my ""unfiltered mode"" or something. However, it typically appears as strong as it does when I'm alone due to build up. It's exaggerated even compared to what I might call my more ""natural state"" because I suppress it all day, sometimes for days on end. It ALWAYS slips out though, for sure. I channel it into fidgeting, looking around the room, imperceptible stims that nobody sees (or if they did wouldn't spark too many questions), or simply 1000 yard ptsd-like looking stares when overstimulated. 

I have always had the sense that sometimes people see into that side of me a bit more than others, and I can see the gears turning in their heads as to what might be off or different. I've had plenty of passing remarks about some ""weird thing"" I've done or twitch or tic that slipped out, but, never enough to really be considered a ""weird person"" (again, to use what most NTs might say). I've had plenty of comments on my ""unique personality"", though. Usually it's not demeaning though and more out of a curiosity they have with me than anything."
autism,fpxm6cr,t1_fpxic7a,1588985196.0,"Great response, I really appreciate it. The more I learn about what autism really is, fundamentally, and not just a list of ""symptoms"" or possible difficulties that can arise for an autistic person, the more comfortable I become in my own self-assessment that I carry many of those traits. It's slow process, but, it is a ""process"" after all. 

I stim furiously in private and can look quite ""stereotypically autistic"" while doing so. If literally anyone in my life were to see me stim authentically without some sort of suppression or ""dialing in down"", they'd honestly think I was messing with them. I suppress meltdowns until I'm alone and have been able to almost ""autopilot"" shutdowns when they happen in public (I always deflect from my actual internal state in these situations and ""play it off"" to varying degrees of success). Eye contact is very intense to me, but, I've learned to get used to the fact that I have to ""stare into people's souls"" here and there to be taken seriously. I have a wide range of obsessive special interests that I engage in on my own purely for pleasure and self-satisfaction. I also just lie a lot about my internal state. I'm always assuring people I'm fine when I'm not just so I don't have to navigate the social interaction and attention of actually addressing what's wrong around other people. Etc, etc, etc.  

>For instance telling yourself “i am autistic” vs telling other people is two totally seperate things.

At this point, I would have trouble calling myself autistic publicly. Again, not out of any kind of shame, just because I feel like most people just wouldn't understand and would think I was trying to seek attention or make excuses for mistakes or something to that effect. At the moment I just don't feel equipped to go through that process of explaining with everyone in my life, especially people who may have their doubts. That being said, it sure would be nice to have a bit more understanding from a lot of people."
autism,fpxga75,t1_fpvglne,1588982118.0,">Also i noticed you said “have ASD”, try “am autistic” instead.

This is something I've been struggling with a bit. I recently realized through self introspection, thorough research, and further discussion with my family and therapist that there's a very high likelihood that I'm ""on the spectrum"". However, I feel a bit self conscious and almost guilty saying ""I'm autistic"". Not because of any shame or denial or harsh judgement of autism, quite the opposite. I almost feel like I'm ""appropriating"" autism because I've been judged to be neurotypical my entire life and have always ""passed"" in the eyes of society. I hide it really well, *too well to actually be autistic* I sometimes think.

Don't get me wrong, I've had A LOT of challenges and I think in many ways the label fits, however, it's hard to get used to and even to own when so many people were diagnosed much earlier and had to receive so much support that I apparently just got by without. I could have benefitted massively from some of these supports, I'm sure. However, I ""made it this far"", so I'm having trouble confidently calling myself autistic when I see the broad range of disability associated with autism. I feel like it's ""mild"" or ""high-functioning"", even though I know many people have problems with those words in relation to describing autism. 

I'm curious if you have any perspective on that or any advice. I'm in my late twenties and this is the first time in my entire life it's even been suggested that I have autism, though, it's been noted since early childhood that I had many different issues that could be associated with autism that were addressed individually."
ADHD,fpxb5hm,t3_gfsq46,1588979198.0,"Very true. While I've been very lucky in my life with the parents I have, they're far from perfect and didn't always handle things perfectly. Of course not, they're human. However, the things that they did wrong NEVER crossed my mind as bad or wrong until I was practically in my mid 20s. We often grow up having no reference for normalcy or proper behavior, so, our parents ARE the standard for normalcy. 

There were a million little things they did that were of such minor significance to them that they barely even registered as having done them at all, or if they did remember, they were seen as such non-events that they were hardly ever conscious of having done them. Many of these ""little things"" practically shaped my reality as a child. For instance, if I asked a question and my mom gave me a quick BS answer that she just made up to get me to stop asking questions (I had *a lot* all the time lol) while she was distracted or busy, that went into my brain and became absolute fact until proven otherwise. When I'd apply these answers to life and they'd fail me, I'd often get scolded for it. When I told them that I was only doing what I was told, it was always denied that they'd ever even said something like that. 

I have a terrible working and short term memory. My long-term memory for past events and conversations seems to FAR surpass the rest of my family's. My absolute and definite *knowing* of what they said and when caused me internal conflict when it was denied. At best, maybe they would acknowledge these BS pieces of advice or facts about the world, but, would insist that they were just joking and that I was foolish to take it seriously (despite what seemed to my very young self as being sincere advice or knowledge). When pressed, they tend to get flustered and don't want to talk about it (even when it came up because of some accusation they made to me where I explained my behavior as being related to or informed by something that *they* had told me). 

I'd known about the term gas-lighting years before I even considered it was something that was done to me, especially by my parents. Again, it was nothing that was truly devastating or drastically harmful, however, the term still applies to what was done so casually. It always amazed me that something that I remembered SO WELL and took SO SERIOUSLY that it informed my worldview and behavior for years afterward couldn't even be remembered or even denied after the fact by my parents. ""I never said that"", ""Well, I didn't mean it like that!"", and ""Come on, you knew I was just joking"" were things I heard and still hear all the time. Kids are so impressionable. A throwaway comment that you made up on the spot can actually stick in a kids brain for years on end, informing their decisions and behavior, despite your intentions or awareness when you said it."

Nobody questioned my ""odd"" behavior because I was drinking or on drugs, and they never harshly judged it and even found it fun or attractive because they were also drinking or on drugs. 

While I'd say it definitely helped me socially in college, I could never recommend this to young people. I ended up relying on it and eventually I was still drinking or on drugs, but, all the people who found it fun to be around were eventually gone and I was left with addiction issues. I will admit though that, for a time, experimenting with substances in a loose non-judgmental social setting really added to my life in positive ways. It just didn't last. Also, when I was sober and out of energy from partying or schoolwork, people wondered where that ""fun"" version of me went and were less impressed with what was left over."

What they don't see is me going home and staring at a wall or screen for hours on end while stimming like I'm being electrocuted. I don't even know how I manage to hold it all in. I can easily pass for not just NT, but an extroverted socially savvy NT in most situations as long as I have the energy for it.

""Just a short call or text conversation"" may not be a lot to ask for one person, but, when you multiply that by all the people who are potentially ""not asking for a lot"" it becomes A LOT for me to process and deal with. It's always a delicate balance for me.

autism,fppmugw,t1_fpooskg,1588805217.0,"Damn, this whole thread is so relatable. I had a huge range of physical and somatic issues as a kid that I was simply taught to ignore or were treated as a nuisance. I was just being difficult or lazy when I was constantly feeling sick or in pain. Don't get me wrong, my family loved me and still does. They just didn't realize that what they thought were minor issues of an overly sensitive child with a low pain tolerance were actually MAJOR issues of a child who couldn't properly advocate for themselves and had a huge pain tolerance from dealing with constant pain day in day out. If I actually bothered to speak up about it, you'd better believe it was debilitating at that point. Throw that on top of a ton of executive functioning issues, sleep problems, food allergies, chronic fatigue, etc, etc. 

Then once I was an adult and started getting all these diagnoses, it was like a total 180 and a ""OMG my poor baby! Why didn't you TELL US?!"" .......It was kinda hard to not rub their faces in it, honestly.

autism,fppl1os,t1_fpojb4d,1588804253.0,"I just gotta say, as a new member of this sub, I can't get enough of conversations like these. So many well thought out and detailed conversations and responses to complicated issues. I relate to them so much and it's almost jarring to see some of my own thoughts mirrored so well. 

I always struggled to understand how certain aspects of human behavior, motivation, and emotion that seemed so obvious to me could be so threatening or even just of little interest to many NTs. I used to be confused why people either seemed to be in active denial of their own human nature or simply didn't even notice various aspects of it that I have to think about in great detail constantly. Sometimes if I ask someone about something that I consider to be fairly universal and obvious, I get a reaction that you'd expect if someone suddenly started describing you naked or something. It almost feels like I'm not supposed to know some of these things and people feel almost violated when I talk about them, even when referring to myself.  There's this hidden etiquette of what seems to me either like denial or willful ignorance.

I don't even have big problems with boundaries particularly, and usually know what topics makes people uncomfortable and avoid discussing those things. However, even what seems like very basic things having to do with psychology that I almost assume everyone knows (that's a big part of my problem right there, I have a degree in psychology and research it obsessively but sometimes act like everyone else does as well) is either completely baffling to most people or even seen as threatening or invasive.

One seems to think the way forward is to tip the scale to almost give women a kind of “handicap” or an extra leg up (possibly at the expense of men, but, that’s justified from that point of view due to them thinking there’s so much inherent inequality) to combat historical and current oppression that was and is indeed quite real. I can recognize that oppression and I'm supportive if change. However, the egalitarian solution would involve listening to everyone equally and coming up with solutions together. Not simply listening to, believing, or helping women *more* than men in some attempt to “even the score”. All that does is perpetuate inequality and resentment. Men have issues too that deserve to be heard and supported. Merely bringing this up though in the political climate I live in is cause for an in depth inquisition of your politics and awareness of women's issues.

I really don’t want to be so salty about this. I know exactly how it must sound to most feminists and who they probably picture in their head if they read this. I’ve heard all the responses to it by now. I’m really just a normal guy who tries to be a compassionate person. I’m not even on the whole MRA train personally. It’s just hard to feel so misunderstood all the time by the people close to me and not being able to express that feeling without being called “fragile”.

Look. I don’t discount women’s problems at all and support their movements for social change. However, *even implying* that men have *different* issues *that are just as important* apparently seems like an attack on the problems of women. And any problems men have that *are* actually acknowledged by these people are immediately blamed on other men and “the patriarchy” and the whole discussion is shifted from those men’s experiences and issues to just another reason for why we need feminism...

Not everyone thinks this way, but, where I live it’s quite common and it’s honestly easier to just keep my mouth shut. I’ve naively tried to have genuine and honest discussions about this with these people before, and, it never goes as well as I might’ve hoped.

Beware of righteousness. It’s okay to have issues with a person who behaves badly. It isn’t okay to negatively generalize an entire demographic based on genetic inborn characteristics. I see so many examples of people preaching this ideology of tolerance, only to do the opposite because they think they’re fighting oppression.

You won't find me holding up signs next to the freeway screaming about the latest theory."

facepalm,forrfyg,t1_foqnbpl,1588017208.0,"I live next to them. They’ve been out grilling and gathering like it’s the 4th of July every damn day in “protest”. I swear they hold more social events now than before the virus. Not a single person at these parties doesn’t have a pickup truck (there are at least 10 in the yard every time) and all of them drink bud light under a flag that says “Saturdays are for the boys”. Other people will drive by and honk their horns and do some kind of redneck cheer whoop at them as they drive by the yard as a form of “support”. The supporters are always in a pickup truck, though, I once saw someone do it in a jeep wrangler.

I know it’s a stereotype, and I know plenty of good people who drive trucks, drink shitty beer, and like watching sports with friends. But...jesus christ they are about as stereotypical as it comes. I wish I could say I was surprised that they don’t seem to worry about this virus one bit. And this is on the east coast near major cities, by the way. They aren’t backwoods rednecks who don’t have as much of a chance of spreading it."
facepalm,forput4,t1_forl6oq,1588016398.0,"This is why I NEVER talk about “conspiracy” stuff with anyone who doesn’t know me very very well. I loathe the idea that I could be lumped into this category of idiots who watched a couple youtube videos and don’t even comprehend the depth and complexity of the very theories they screech about. 

They aren’t all baseless and some of them are truly worth considering. I swear though, the majority of people who identify as being into conspiracy theory are the worst people possible to talk about it. If there is an illuminati, these people are making their goals that much easier to attain. It’s the perfect cover. Get people to believe that only stupid people think about it. 

I think the biggest difference between me and someone talking about the illuminati at a covid protest is that I reserve belief and don’t go all in so fast. I don’t “believe” in any conspiracy theories. That said, some of them are far more intricate and plausible than what you’ll see crazy people screaming about in the streets. It’s the same thing with ufos. There’s always plenty of nonsense and idiots misinterpreting things to give any real conspiracy all the cover it needs. It’s good to question. It’s NOT good to go around basing your whole worldview on those questions that you’ve already answered for yourself with no evidence and screaming at all the “sheeple” who are too blind to see the “truth”. That’s how you entirely discredit and undermine your own cause (which you misunderstood from the beginning)."
playrust,foo7xpt,t1_fomnmhh,1587934248.0,Was the 6600K overclocked? I have mine at 4.3ghz and don't have many issues. That along with my gtx 1080 get me 60-90 fps no problem on mostly the highest settings in 1440p. I swear the server and internet mess up my gameplay more than my hardware. Then I go and see posts about people with the newest i9s/i7s and rtx 2080s saying the game is unoptimized and they get garbage frame rates. I just don't understand.
videos,foh4t5a,t1_fog55pa,1587760544.0,"I worked at a wilderness survival skills camp for years. We taught medicinal plants like this. I think it’s good to know, however, some of the new-agey hippie types I worked with would *only* use plants, even in their personal lives. They claimed it was superior to modern medicine, even if the chemical compounds that produced the desired effect were exactly the same as plant (minus all the other random chemicals found in the plant). I admit I fell into this preference for using plants for a minute as well, but, I just thought it was cool that so many plants could be useful as medicine *in the lack of modern medicine*. I never considered the plant version superior. They thought it was automatically better because it was natural and unprocessed. It was also claimed to be a spiritual thing for my coworkers. I totally get wanting to connect with the earth and honoring ancestral knowledge, that’s why I worked at the camp. However, you could bet you bottom dollar if given the option I’ll choose modern medicine over ancestral any day."
playrust,fogyx1h,t1_fofib6v,1587758575.0,"Well, you sound like you have a legitimate problem running it. I'm talking about people with supercomputers who still claim it runs like garbage, which I feel to be a huge exaggeration."
Anxiety,fod56rl,t1_fo9xh3b,1587680055.0,"While it definitely does cause those symptoms and tests have confirmed I don't have heart issues, it still feels like it can't be good in the long run. If just *stress* is bad for you, I can only imagine how bad the *extreme and chronic levels of stress* from anxiety and panic attacks can be for your body. 

Of course, that just gives me another thing to worry about and trigger anxiety. I've long ago accepted that anxiety causes me all these symptoms. I refuse to believe that all those symptoms day in day out aren't detrimental to my health or life expectancy and being told not to worry about it because it's ""just anxiety"" does the opposite of reassuring me."
Anxiety,fod3xe6,t1_fock704,1587679538.0,"It's been years and I'm *still* skeptical of doctors telling me it's just anxiety. I've come to accept it, but, in the back of my head I always question it (another fun feature of anxiety) despite now having lots of test results and life experience that seems to confirm their assertions. It just feels so intense and physical that it's genuinely hard for me to have faith that it isn't a larger systemic issue. 

Then I think, even if it all is 100% just anxiety, the effects it has on the body in the long term simply can't be healthy. It feels like it does real damage over time. I feel like I take time off my life expectancy every time I have a legitimate panic attack, as if each one brings me closer and closer to actually having a stroke or heart attack. I understand it comes from a mental disorder. However, it also feels genetic. All of my grandparents were incredibly anxious people and none of them were in good health or lived very long..."
adhdmeme,foczeuk,t1_fo99qru,1587677906.0,"I understand that for sure. I work with kids (mostly ADHD or with other diagnoses) so I know exactly how difficult it can be to find balance. I understand how it feels like you can't win sometimes even if you're really clear. The thing that effected me most was the assumption that I was doing it on purpose or to annoy them, when I think that most people would be able to tell I was simply struggling. I know that the teachers were overwhelmed and struggling too. My teacher obviously wasn't in a good mood that day and had young children on her own at the time to deal with."
