ShaneDawson,es0ea45,t3_c58jvt,1561473231.0,It was clear as day Bobby suffered a breakdown after Shane fired him. I hope his mental health is getting treatment and that he is better. It was scummy that Shane promised Bobby the world and dropped him at the first chance he got.

You are 100 percent right that these videos are not what the fans want. This makes it even more infuriating that he is force feeding us this advertisement in disguise series so he can milk his cash cow audience for a product he could care less about."
ShaneDawson,ertfyqu,t1_ersixry,1561241286.0,I love Drew and Garett Watts so much. I feel like Drew has to take a step away from making content because his mental health was suffering so I hope he is feeling better.

ShaneDawson,ertfijx,t1_erspu4v,1561240919.0,"He just wants to make a quick buck by making paid product placement advertisements. If you want to watch a legit documentary, watch Louis Theroux or David Attenborough on the BBC."
ShaneDawson,ertfeq2,t1_erspb86,1561240833.0,Shane isn’t creating a documentary. He is making an advertisement in disguise infomercial to shill an overpriced product he couldn’t care less about. The deception for the sake of treating his audience as his personal cash cow (or piggy) is what I hate most about this current meta.
ShaneDawson,ertf9my,t1_erstbiz,1561240722.0,"I think Shane is bitterly resentful that his feature film flopped and he has to make YouTube videos. Shane even said that he didn’t want to be making YouTube videos when he turned 30 and look where we are.

It’s just a job for him to finance a very expensive mansion he just bought."
ShaneDawson,ertf5od,t1_ertbw0r,1561240633.0,I feel like his upcoming videos are informercials for a shitty product he wants to make bank on. He has stated in previous videos that he hates makeup so I find it a bit far fetched to believe that his new calling is in makeup.
