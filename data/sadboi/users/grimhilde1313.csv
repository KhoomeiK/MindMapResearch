This is true found out that she gives him treats constantly which was some comfort that he’s like you say just going to food.


Thank you as well for the advice and knowing I’m not alone in this type situation. I appreciate the help!"
DogAdvice,ey44usm,t1_ey237bs,1566781856.0,"I definitely agree with this, and it seems like the most plausible. Because when I made a comment to my dad about it, he said he only like my sister bc she’s constantly giving him treats. Which was some comfort and made me think of what you said.

Thank you for the advice and also for not making me feel like I’m crazy!"

SuicideWatch,ewek5nr,t1_ewei662,1565326671.0,"Thank you, I really appreciate the kindness. To be honest, I feel no one in my life would care. Because I have been vocal about when I’m feeling sad, why I’m feeling a certain way, and when I am feeling suicidal. No one listens. They if they do, it’s just to invalidate my feelings or make fun of me.  That’s why I feel that way. I wish there was a reset button to start fresh, and just leave this life."
SuicideWatch,ewehhmv,t3_cnx57j,1565324236.0,"Whil I don’t know the stresses of parenthood. I know what it is to struggle with that feeling; maybe not 100, but pretty close. But hold on, fight, use your kids as strength. They need their father, they are full of unconditional love, and purity. Hug, them, hold them. Feel that love to help you hold on. 

While we are internet strangers, and cliche, I am head to listen and help you fight."
