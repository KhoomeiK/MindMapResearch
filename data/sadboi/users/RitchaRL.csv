socialanxiety,ez8bd0g,t1_ez88wy9,1567738762.0,I'm not able to effectively carry a conversation for a prolonged period. I don't know what to talk about. Theres probably only 1 or 2 people in my life who I can talk with 1 on 1 and they carry the conversation heavily. So its made even worse when it comes to texting direct with another person. I'm dry and not creative enough to come up with things to say/talk about so its super hard to make new friends because I have this problem both IRL and online
