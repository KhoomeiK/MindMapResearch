WatchPeopleDieInside,fr2sk0y,t1_fr27dxa,1589843065.0,"I have Asian parents but my fathers first language is English(Singapore) whereas my moms is Chinese. While my dad speaks clear and fluent English my mom has difficulty pronouncing words perfectly. As a child I didn't know this, which led to quite a few odd circumstances. 

For example, my mom for the longest time would say ""bladdy yauw"" and I would imitate her thinking it was a *chinese* swear word. After a while my dad told me to stop making fun of my moms accent and I said I wasn't. I genuinely thought that was a phrase used when something bad happens. 

Turns out my mom was trying to say ""bloody hell"" the entire time. But her having learned English in Australia caused the initial pronounciation to be skewed anyway, so on top of her way of pronouncing things it became that. 

Although not pronounciation related my parents used to refer to peeing and pooping as pissing and shitting, ever since I was little. I didn't use it as profanity until one day I enrolled in an international school when I was about 6 years old. So for the first time in my life I was speaking English with somebody other than my parents(my extended family speaks ""Asian""). Lo and behold my 6 year old ass when I needed to go poop went up to the teacher and said ""ms. Muuze, I need to go shit"". Naturally I got a scolding from her on how we don't use that word and that if we need to go we say can I go to the bathroom or something along those lines. Teacher must've thought my parents were terrible for using profanity at home when in reality to me it wasn't any different than me saying now that I need to take a shit."

TooAfraidToAsk,fqy85y2,t3_gll5fp,1589744245.0,"France and Sweden are completely different. Comparing European countries as on the same level is an incorrect way of approaching it. 

Primarily if you're looking at the economies of the respective countries you must look at currency for example. None of the Scandinavian countries use the Euro(iirc), while France does. Furthermore a lot of policies between the countries differ, for example military wise they have different levels of involvement and engagement globally. 

There are a lot of factors to take into account when comparing countries that are vastly different. If you were to make a comparison it would have to be between countries that at least had some more geographic similarities because this alone can cause a lot of differences. 

Overall I would say that Scandinavian countries do better because their welfare system is better. The cost of living is extremely high in Scandinavian countries, compared to even countries a few km down south. A lot of this has to do with the incredibly high taxes they pay. Norway for example has a approx 70% income tax bracket for the highest earners. That's more than half of your salary taken away before you even got it. A lot of it goes back into the system as education, health care and infrastructure, meaning less people resort to crime as there's a solid foundation to back you up
Generally speaking across Europe the higher the tax you pay the 'better' the country is. 

Naturally this is a generalisation but taxes get higher the further North-West you travel and so does the standard of living. So you have countries like Hungary and Greece on one end and the other countries like the Netherlands and Norway."

trashy,fqy7307,t3_gll5he,1589743703.0,"Had a convo with a bunch of minorities(I'm a minority myself) on facebook about racism against white people. 

They argued that it was impossible to be racist towards white people. I said that argument within itself is racist. The whole idea behind racism is that you draw arbitrary lines between people classifying them and treating them a certain way because of it. Minorities were not allowed on the front of the bus because of their race, nothing else. That exclusionary behaviour is the fundamental principle underlying racism. 

They stated that the lack of racist history towards white people was what made racism against them non-existent. While I agree that the last 500 years has been that way, it doesn't exempt them from being treated in a racist way. 

I do however agree on the point that institutionalised racism doesn't exist in a country for the 'domestic' population(domestic being whoever is in power). However this isn't an exclusively 'white' country trait. Malaysia has very outright racist laws pertaining the treatment of citizens of the nation whom are not of Malaysian ethnicity. The middle east has some pretty harsh rules on the Jewish population for example. 

Despite the commonality of racist policies around the globe, I think one key difference(from my anecdotal experience as somebody with a foot on both sides) is the 'ethnic' countries whom have racist policies don't deny the outright racism of the policies but highlight more the necessity of doing so, as opposed to 'white' countries that have a tendency to deny it as racism at all(the Netherlands and their 'zwarte piet'). 

It is always important however to understand that these generalisations are just that. They do not hold realistic value in terms of getting a legitimate perspective on what the beliefs of individuals are. It does however allow us to see what the odds are of somebody being treated a certain way would be. 

So to conclude, yes racism exists against white people, an argument to the contrary would be racist. However the racism that white people experience in white countries will *naturally* pale in comparison to the minorities that live in that same country. 

The real question here is what to do with that kind of information. The discussion really starts when we start talking about what we think is acceptable and what is not. Who's opinion matters more? Quantity? Quality? Anecdotal? Statistical? Those are the things we should be talking about."

I'm from the Netherlands so we don't have that issue here but a lot of coffeeshops don't publish the thc content and all that. Mainly due to the illicit nature of the marijuana market at the producer and distributor level. 

So I would recommend maybe adding a feature that helps the illicit users identify what strain they have based on what the legal users have been posting. So maybe below the picture and info of the bud there can be a short description of the flavour, the type of high, non-visual properties of the nugs, that kind of thing. 

This way you're able to maybe pull in the audience based in places outside of legal states such as Canada, the Netherlands and some American states. 

Maybe add in whatever popular strains already exist, giving information and identifiable features.

AskReddit,fqxuw20,t3_gljfd6,1589738247.0,"I'm not a vegan or vegetarian even, however I completely support the cause, on a logical level so to speak. 

If we look at the arguments against meat consumption in the modern day there are a few factors to look at. 

1. Resources
As mentioned by a previous comment the amount of resources it takes to make meat is unbelievable. First of all you need land for the animals to chill on and to make it profitable you mass produce and have thousands of animals on that land. So naturally you have to free up some land somewhere that is relatively cheap, usually places that have trees on them because nobody is going to lay claim to that land. So you cut down a ton of trees so that you can put your animals there. Then you need to make sure you have the facilities on that land for the animals because animals require more care(salt intake of cows for example). Then you need food for the animal, so you need to grow crops, which requires more land and as in the previous step you cut down a forest to free up land. There's more hassle involved but this is the basic principle of animal farming. 

2. The environment
Environment is getting totally fucked by animal farming. Firstly production cost of animals requires use of a lot of energy, that needs to be brought in from somewhere, usually non renewable energy. Contributing to the carbon footprint. Then the methane(far more harmful than CO2 as a greenhouse gas) produced by the animal in question and considering you have thousands of them you're talking about a lot of methane gas. Then lastly in terms of cutting down trees to make space, I don't think I need to explain why it's harmful(there are rumours about the Brazilian Amazon fire being started by farmers to make space for more farming land). 

3. The cruelty
This is the main argument for most vegans/vegetarians I know. While as you have said animals eat other animals in the wild. This is completely true. However no other animal on our planet keeps thousands of animals locked up in tiny encampments covered in each others shit and piss, pumped full of drugs, force-fed, forcefully inseminate them, seperate them from their newborns, and then at the end of their miserable lives we slaughter them en masse. 

Believe it or not these animals have feelings and intelligence. Pigs and cows are mammals that have intelligence comparable to that of a dog. Now if a dog went through what cows and pigs went through would you not feel outraged? Doesn't that YuLin dog festival in China cause you grief that anybody could treat such kind, intelligent creatures like that. Now imagine how vegetarians and vegans look at meat eaters as they stack their  extra cheesy, triple bacon, double hamburger, with literally no argument as to why you continuously eat meat besides 'it tastes good' or 'it's natural'. 

As a meat eater I have yet to hear someone come up with a serious answer outside of ""BuT bAcON"". 

I eat meat because I'm not afraid to admit I'm a shitty person. If you can admit you don't care about animal lives or the planet, fully acknowledging what is happening as a consequence of your actions, then I say go ahead. Just don't be ignorant about it."
NoStupidQuestions,fqxskxc,t3_gljfhl,1589737197.0,"Just speculation but mayhaps that's what a mix of the two would look like. Arabs and Europeans share a lot of similar features in terms of nose size, facial structure, and hairiness. The main thing tjat differs betweem Arabs and Europeans is the tone of their skin, hair and eyes. However most Arabs aren't South Asian dark and a lot of Europeans aren't Swedish light. A lot of Europeans have dark skin, dark hair and dark eyes too. 

If you look at Italians for example they are quite Arab looking and if you look at some Turkish people they are extremely European looking.

I think one of the things we are most afraid of is dying(on a subconscious level and conscious) and the thought of not existing anymore and not experiencing anything. While I understand this fear, for me I think we live on forever, just in another form(kind of like in a religious way, but on a scientific level?). Not only do we go back to the dust that we came from as described by religion, which is scientifically true too. We live on in the actions we did and lives we touched. Martin Luther King Jr. lives on not only in history books but every person that is affected by any of his words and actions, this goes for people we would consider as overall negative like Hitler, he'll live for as long as his 'legacy' is carried on for.  

Mayhaps this isn't the immortality that everyone hopes for but death is what makes life so precious. Furthermore even the largest stars eventually die but if it wasn't for that, the elements that make up your mind, body and soul would not exist.

One of the greatest things about reading is that the same story has a different mental appearance for each reader. Describing them with hardcore measurements isn't inherently forced or robotic, as you said, but it does tend to be that way when overused. 

If you let people's imagination fill in the blanks you left, they're more inclined to feel aroused because you're allowing themselves to create that imagination."

tifu,fqt9dbh,t1_fqqzuqd,1589633781.0,"This is extremely true. This is an unfortunate fact of almost all my Asian friends. They grew up in an environment so strict it never allowed them to develop their own personality. It's so widespread that I've had people comment on how surprised they were at how well I spoke English first of all :P and how outspoken I was. They said they never met an Asian guy so sociable and how it's crazy I'm not a nerd. 

While I do agree that the environment they grow up in has such a huge impact on the lack of character they develop, I don't think they are mutually exclusive. You can grow up in a strict environment and develop character. 

For me growing up I had strict Asian parents but they were relatively liberal compared to other Asians. This had an influence but I still had to fight every part of the way to become who I am. I made another comment bragging about what I have accomplished in my life. I absolutely think those things is a product of the conjunction of my parents' strictness as well as my rebelliousness against them. I think that's the thing so many Asian kids lacked when I was growing up. I was the only one who stood up to his parents(hung out with more white kids than the other Asians) and while my other friends are all moderately successful they all follow the traditional Asian paths. 

It's really a case by case type of thing but ultimately I don't think being strict is inherently wrong, it really depends on the kid and the parents in question. However I do definitely agree that making mistakes is a part of learning, not making mistakes means you're underprepared because mistakes=experience."
tifu,fqt8te9,t1_fqsznv2,1589633348.0,"I think this is exactly it. You want to protect your child for all the terrible things you yourself have seen in the world. Any person with a rudimentary understanding of the world knows how horrible it can be. You want to protect your child from the horrors they are unaware of. Especially if you grew up somewhere where people are still fighting for food and any financial welfare. When you know what it's like to grow up with an empty stomach you would never wish that on your child. 

So relating back to Asian parents, can you blame them for acting on their parental instincts by teaching their children the only road to success/happiness they know? Happiness is just a word when you're starving."
tifu,fqt7ylc,t1_fqs94yy,1589632677.0,"I'm not sure if we are talking about the same behaviour but I wouldn't call all Asian strict parents' behaviour as abusive. 

I think the strictness that Asian parents have is what leads to alot of Asians being successful and while that isn't inherently 'happiness' for the child, it's a lot better to be in that position instead of begging on the street for food. 

I'm not sure how much you know about Asia but those who don't work hard(excluding connections) will end up nowhere. Asia is a harsh and cruel place where if you fuck up you're fucked, there's no sympathy from the billions of people that live there all competing for that one position. 

To them in such harsh conditions survival is top priority. This means having a job, putting food on the table and a roof over people's heads. Without those things you don't even have a home to be abusive to your children in. Once you see how unforgiving it is there you completely understand why Asian parents are so afraid of their children not succeeding. 

I'm an Asian myself that grew up with relatively liberal(by Asian standards, still conservatives by western standards) parents. So while I grew up like a lot of Asians with parents that would helicopter over me. They would force me to go to piano lessons for years, went to chinese school every saturday morning, football, all while the other kids were playing, they got their ps4 and all that. I hated my parents, I thought they were abusive and only cared about the prestige that I would bring them as parents. I fought my parents all the time, I went crazy, threw tantrums, everything a rebellious teenager could do as an Asian growing up with white kids. 

Now I speak four languages, play four musical instruments, have had administrational authority in multiple charities, I have conditional offers from masters programs in law and I've travelled to 16 countries in 5 different continents. Although every second I spent learning, organising and experiencing was me, if my parents hadn't given me the upbringing, and not cracked down the whip on my back, I would have definitely been a high school drop out. I say this with almost 100% certainty because I failed so many things throughout my life. I failed my 3rd year of primary school, my 3rd year of secondary school, my 1st year of high school and my 1st year of university. I was smoking cigarrettes when I was 13, I was skipping class, trying to get my hands on drugs, hanging out with the wrong crowd. 

But everytime I tripped and made a mistake it was my parents that ensured I'd stay on the right path until I could walk it on my own. 

I'm not perfect. Far from it. There are tons of things I still struggle and battle with everyday. Things that my parents did do to me that they were unaware of. While you could call these things abusive in the traditional sense of the word, they *never* had any malicious intent and without said ""abuse"" I would have turned out a degenerate and burden to society. 

I can't say that all Asian parents are the same, I don't doubt that there is a wide variety of parenting methods, some more dubious than others. However from what I personally experienced as an Asian(and from my Asian friends) our parents truly want the best for us and the only way they know how is for us to work the hardest we can and be the *best*. 

If you're also an Asian kid growing up with harsh parents pm me. I know it's really difficult at times but once you come out the other end you'll see the fruits of your labour."

tifu,fqqgah5,t3_gk7wiu,1589565012.0,"Ah young love in the Asian community. I(East Asian) was dating a girl(South Asian) in my class, also around 18/19 years old. Was complicated, not only did we come from conservative cultures but our two cultures don't get along swimmingly back home. 

So one day when my mom was out and my dad was at work, I snuck her to my place to mess around. Basically mom came home earlier than I expected, I just spoke to her from upstairs for a bit and she told me she was going out in a second again and I said ok and went upstairs where my girlfriend at the time was. I waited until my mom left before I decided to try and sneak her out. After having snuck her out with no immediate issues, I kiss her goodbye and walk back into my house only to see that one of my moms students had been sitting in the kitchen all along, from which you can see anyone coming down the stairs. 

I didn't say anything to her hoping that maybe she didn't see anything but she ratted on me and my mom gave me shit but at that point I decided I needed to do my own things and not adhere to everything my parents said. They didn't grow up like I did in a foreign country, and while I take on board their advice, unlike quite a few of my Asian friends I'm a lot more 'free'/'independent'. 

After a lot of fighting and arguing I think my parents have come round and started to believe I can make my own decisions and an wise enough not to make fatal mistakes."
tifu,fqqeou4,t1_fqq4oyk,1589564227.0,"I think what you say is right. However the modernization of Asian countries only happened in the last 60-30 years, so for a lot of these people they never grew up in an environment where they could enjoy economic and financial security. 

Furthermore in Asia competition is arguably even higher than before. The attitude towards academia as well as overall life is controlled strictly by parents because even the slightest mess up during adolescence can be fatal in later life. 

So while I agree that the strict Asian parenting style has some serious flaws within western society, to survive in Asian society this is a requirement."

quityourbullshit,fqbj08c,t1_fqafud4,1589237879.0,"As an *actual* full breed, pure blood, direct descendent of Ghengis Khan, this is incorrect. I have never met an Asian otaku that compares with a 'western' one. Although they do exist in Asia, the percentage of people who are so obsessed with the culture to warrant the name otaku in Asia is far and wide. Considering anime and other aspects of Asian culture are inherently Asian it is unsurprising to find that the average Asian consumes Asian media. 

The same still applies generally in the west, in which over half of all consumers of Asian media in some form or another are not obsessed with it and will watch a movie/series here and there(studio ghibli for example). However the percentage of consumers of Asian culture being otakus is far higher than that in Asia.

Naturally having grown up in the west I have encountered far more western people than I have Asian. However I know quite a lot of Asian people from Asia too and anecdotally that's the average spread. 

Might be interesting to note that culturally some of us Asians are inclined to distance ourself from that component of Asian culture due to the negative stigma associated with the average 'otaku'."
