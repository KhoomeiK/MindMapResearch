You act as though we’re somehow a unified group when the only thing we have in common is that we don’t believe in a god. And oh wow, you went on the Internet and found people you didn’t like? Wow what a shocker"
atheism,fqc2w9y,t1_fqbjd0q,1589248999.0,The amount of throwaway accounts that come here just to comment bullshit is really pathetic. Like are you really so scared that you can’t just make a comment on your normal account? Really?
atheism,fqc1dct,t1_fqbu0o6,1589248109.0,"At least your definition is somewhat straight forward. I also find it weird that people often say we’re made in god’s image, and then I actually think about humanity. Sure there’s all the good things, but we’re also liars, thieves, murderers, narcissists, etc. If a god exists and we actually are made in his image then that god can’t be very nice, can he?"
