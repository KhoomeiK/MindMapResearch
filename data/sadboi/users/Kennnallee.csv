I’ve been in her place and the reason for her not wanting to is because she’s either ashamed or she wants to make sure she can go through with it. A lot of kids especially that age don’t really know why they don’t want people to know. Whatever bad might come out of telling them is not even near as bad as what might happen if you don’t. I know you’re both probably very young with her being 13 and it’s hard to go against your friends wishes like that, but that could be between life and death for her. This isn’t a death wish, this wish could put her on her deathbed. Just call the police and tell them everything you told me, you might even be able to text them.

I know it’s hard to be that young and go against your friends wishes, but you could be saving her life. You probably are. Whatever her reason is 100% is going to cause her harm. This isn’t her death wish; this is the wish that might kill her. Just call 911, tell them whats happening and that you are worried for her life, tell them that she doesn’t want people to know whatever, you can tell them to be anonymous.

service_dogs,fpu9py9,t1_fpu8zcz,1588907762.0,"this is going to sound very harsh but it’s coming from experience. i developed a panic disorder when i was 13. for a while i was desperate for a service dog because i was overcome with anxiety and couldn’t leave without having one... i thought. i was told off for bringing it up from my mother and told i don’t even really have the diagnosis’s i did. i developed intense agoraphobia a year ago. i’m 18 1/2 now. i was so miserable back then, and still am now.

but

if i had gotten one back then i wouldn’t have developed the coping skills i did. getting a service dog has the possibility of stopping you from getting better especially for psychiatric reasons. you need to be older and be more settled into your issues to really know if it’s the best idea and also to know what you really actually need your dog to do. i know this because around half of the issues i had back then have either changed or gone away. and i have gotten many more. if i had gotten one back then i would have been training for things that i wouldn’t have needed a year later. i’m going to be getting my prospect soon and even tho i still have panic disorder, it’s not really the same at all. i cant stop you,and i don’t know your exact scenario, but i would urge you to talk to your school when you go back about some minor accommodations and getting a therapist. i promise no matter what it’ll be better for you."
