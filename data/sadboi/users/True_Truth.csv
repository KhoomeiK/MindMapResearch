I then had to research how far it would have be away inside to make sure it was okay which was about 5mm give or take. Tighten it down to make sure it doesn't move and now it doesn't sag and stays in place. You would think even without the rod it would move just by one rod, but apparently it doesn't so something changed in the design as I tightened that thing so many damn times in different ways I could make a bible out of it."
