Your therapist is concentrating on you, not on their own loss. We get very good at boundaries and compartmentalizing our lives from our client‚Äôs lives.

It can take weeks, if your body hasn‚Äôt regained equilibrium or baseline for you. I would recommend square breathing and breath focused meditation 5 min...3 times a day. Both techniques are in Calm the Body series. Exercise also helps to burn up the cortisol and adrenaline. If my body feels amped up, exercise always brings me back to feeling relaxed again. üòä"

I am happy that you are working with a therapist. Have you already done Interoceptive Exposure Therapy and imaginal exposures before you started going for walks? It is not necessarily bad to have a panic attack while doing an exposure. It can increase the strength of the exposure. And the exposures should be varied greatly and not the same walk trying for more distance. It sounds like you are really, really trying and I want to encourage you to keep trying, regardless of setbacks. Set your mental intentions on that you are going to continue working on it no matter what it takes. Keep that intention through the ups and downs and you will overcome this.

My name is Paige and I have started a YouTube channel to support my clients and others with Anxiety, OCD, Depression and other mental health issues and concerns. I am a psychotherapist and I originally wanted to supplement my client‚Äôs treatment by having videos to refer to for specific recommended techniques, like breathing and relaxation exercises.

What surprised me about YouTube was that people from all over the World would begin to follow me. I have learned that many people have absolutely no access to help for mental health issues and appreciate the resources available on YouTube.

I was shocked by the difficulties I had on the technical side and ended up seeking help in editing and uploading videos.

OCD,f7n06kt,t3_dx1ekw,1573879328.0,"I really appreciate your comments and understand how you feel. This technique is more for mild to moderate OCD. When I work with someone with severe OCD, I typically use ERP. The ‚Äúask for more‚Äù strategy is there to help clients confront their OCD and fears by doing the opposite action. It is a highly effective technique for panic and anxiety as well. I agree with your comments completely and appreciate your feedback. I have committed much of my practice to learning every possible way to help people with OCD and Anxiety. In a few weeks, I will be sharing some of the most recent research on how to make Exposures more effective on my YouTube channel. I will share with you a link to my video on ERP. I want you to know that I know you are suffering. A client of mine that sounds very familiar to you, that had severe contamination OCD and ordering and exactness or ‚Äújust right‚Äù OCD, made significant progress after months of ERP. She couldn‚Äôt sit, touch anything, showered for 7 hours a day, basically was completely controlled by her OCD...and she has now recovered. It is a long and challenging process with many setbacks, but you have to keep trying. I wish you the best and hope to hear from you from time to time, to see how you are doing.

I have a video coming out on how I treat my clients with agoraphobia on Monday. I want you to know that it is normal and actually necessary to be afraid before you begin Exposure Therapy. It makes it more effective if you are afraid and vary your exposures. And it is important to take a nap as soon as possible after your exposures to allow a protein synthesis to occur in your brain that consolidates the memory. I have spent the last several weeks researching how to make exposures even more effective and I will share that information in 2 weeks. Here are 2 videos on Exposure Therapy. You‚Äôve got this!
