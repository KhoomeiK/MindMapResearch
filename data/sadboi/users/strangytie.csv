I see casting calls all the time for specific races or ethnicities or ages or genders.

Similarly they also look for people with stand-in experience (as in they’ve done it IRL) and sometimes also want stand-ins of a certain background. 

It isn’t race discrimination to put a specific race or ethnicity in the casting call. However it’s not easy to find out if you weren’t cast because of your race or ethnicity even if you applied for a casting call that is supposedly open to all backgrounds because, generally, casting directors will not tell you why they cut you.

All of these point to much more serious issue beyond him being an overbearing food cop. 

Controlling/abusive partners don’t have to tick every box to be considered such, nor do they have to be the stereotypical violent, isolating, cruel person. Many people don’t even realize their partner is controlling until after they’ve left the relationship because it was subtle or “wasn’t frequent enough” or “they have a good side too”. These things he’s doing are a very serious problem and you should consider reaching out to a professional or trusted family/friends to discuss what to do and wether this could behavior could escalate."

relationships,fg48eob,t3_ewtabn,1580498337.0,"She did it with the intent to make you feel bad and deter you from having friends over. You’re right to be upset that she hates your friends so much she’s willing to possibly make all your friends stop hanging out with you. 

If she had started a match and was too overly excited to recognize you weren’t up for it, and genuinely didn’t mean any harm, that’s different. Misreading vibes and wrestling someone who you thought would be down is a mistake that can happen. But from what you’ve posted it sounds like she did it knowing you would want to."
relationships,fg47ufd,t3_ewsv48,1580497993.0,"This seems way beyond just concern for your health. There’s a very big difference between “I feel that if I didn’t remind you of your diet that you might lose track of it over time” and “I couldn’t trust you to control yourself if I looked away”.

This is a very controlling thing to do and it’s a red flag to many relationship advisors. It’s not inherently abusive (it’s more a symptom than a for-sure warning sign) but it is unhealthy. And it is unhealthy BECAUSE he’s making you do this when you don’t want to, regardless of wether it’s “working” or not. 

If you would restrict yourself in the same way, that’s one thing.  But you said you’re unhappy about this. If you would never do this to yourself unless he was constantly badgering you and belittling your ability to self-regulate your eating habits, it’s a problem and he’s not looking out for you, he’s controlling you.

He’s not justified. Hurting someone emotionally is not tough love or inspiring them to do better. It’s just being a horrible person to someone who you’re supposed to love unconditionally."

She honestly may not see it as flirting or attraction because she’s not attracted to him.

Even though I wasn’t interested in them that way.

ADHD,fg0lqrz,t3_evzi30,1580410338.0,"I was evaluated when I was nine but I had to get re-evaluated at 14 (just to make sure I didn’t, y’know, get cured of my adhd). When I was nine, I don’t remember going to a psychologist but it could have happened. I do remember my parents and stepparents and teachers getting evaluations to fill out about me, and some of my former teachers from earlier grades. At fourteen I sat through one many-hours-long evaluation with a psychologist and she also spoke to my parents. I took a day off school to spend with her. 

I got medication at 9, though it’s easier to prescribe a nine-year-old stimulants than an adult/teenager because the chances of them trying to deal or abuse is significantly lower. I don’t agree with the amount of difficulty it takes to treat adults with adhd but that’s why it is the way it is. 

I stopped meds ages 11-13 because of health reasons and when I needed them again at 14, I was lucky that my doctor raised an ADHD kid who at the time had just finished college so he put me on meds as soon as I came back in following the psychologist meeting because he knew how important they were."

I usually talk to my support system (which for me is my stepmom or my boyfriend) about it and talk through what I’m feeling. And then I’ll go and do something fun that I can do because I’m healthier now, like dancing around the house or taking a nice, long shower.

I try to focus on all the things I am able to do now because I’m better, even if it’s something dumb like “I can catch things in my lap”.

I’m not a fan of the idea that maturity means not having any comfort items. It’s dumb. If having a toy makes you feel good, safe, comfortable, then be those things. Don’t deprive yourself of comfort because it’s “immature”.

Hell, I was raised from 5-12 by an emotionally abusive stepparent (more hatred and power politics than guilting me) and I’m still unsure sometimes if he was “really that bad”. One of the harder parts of this is recognizing that it was bad for you, and that’s what matters. Not that there are worse people out there. You don’t deserve “not the worst”. And you shouldn’t be made to feel like you ARE the worst by that same person. 

He’s calling you names and insulting you. He is manipulating you and making you feel bad for wanting to leave him. He has refused to allow you to break up with him.

But there is a difference between an impulsive statement you say and apologize for and trying to justify insulting your own child, not allowing them to have any agency, or privacy.

I’m an emotional abuse survivor myself, though I was lucky that it was an abusive stepparent and my parent divorced them after six or so years. Your parents should NEVER lay hands on you the way your father did. Your parents shouldn’t treat you like you owe them, like they own you. And parents aren’t supposed to insult you, belittle you, or scream at you in an effort to make you submit to them, or fear them.
