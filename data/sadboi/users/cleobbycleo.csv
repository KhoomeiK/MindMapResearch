Mediums,fmk96jx,t1_fmk00o5,1586147838.0,"I'd like to think that the tense, fearful energy is that of those around us who are feeling this way. Some of the media  sources are perpetuating a lot of fear. This isn't to say that there aren't genuinely scary things happening right now; there are definitely things happening and many heavier emotions swirling around on a mass scale at the moment. I just feel that those fearful feelings are being further facilitated both by those certain media sources as well as from one already-fearful person, who has now seen said newsfeeds, to another. And I think when people are afraid of something long term it is really easy to get lost in that pitfall of constant worry, which exasperates the fear, and can then be felt by those around them even if they were not afraid before. 


With that in mind, if you are wondering whether these feelings are your own or that of the collective people surrounding you, I think that's worth taking a step back and observing for a moment. I feel like intuitiveness and empathic ability are usually coexisting in people and that may cause a lot of stress when you begin to feel feelings that may not even be your own. 

This, in my opinion, is the perfect time for a grounding meditation or any sort of activity that works for you which may help you calm your mind and decipher whether or not the feelings are yours. If you conclude they are not your own feelings, you are then able to then have a better understanding of which feelings *are* yours, and hold onto those if it suits you while accepting and letting go of the feelings that do not belong to you. 

 This is still hard for me to do at times, but personally meditation has been helping me get better, and has also helped me decide which of my own heavy feelings are also worth letting go! I even find myself more in tune with my intuition as I am becoming more perceptive as well as more capable of freeing my mind/letting go of blocking feelings in order to receive my intuitive feelings more clearly....if that makes sense 😅😅

Again, I hope this helps. 😭💖"

Mediums,fmjuc53,t3_fvo92f,1586137914.0,"Before 2019 ended I kept having this recurring feeling that something was going to happen which would affect not just me but the entire world. But I didn't feel panicked about it, because every time I would start to get nervous I would get a following feeling of calm over me, like everything would be okay in the end. Like everyone's lives were going to be impacted drastically, but in the end it would make room for positive changes around the world and that everything would be okay. 

Skipping forward to now, I'm thinking that if this pandemic was the feeling I was having, that many positive changes will bloom from this in the end. I think I'm already seeing some positive changes between the way people are interacting with each other, keeping each other informed, and becoming more connected with each other somehow despite the distance. Especially with the global meditation which was planned for yesterday, and seeing everyone's responses to feeling positively connected to one another and the universe after having done this meditation in global unison. 

I don't know if this response helps any or not, but either way I am sending all my best and most positive vibes to you and to our world.  ✨💖✨"

Staying in that relationship was making me feel worthless, paranoid, depressed, and suicidal. I felt like no matter what I gave her or did for her to help or show her I care and love her, she was never satisfied and I was never worthy of any kind of emotional reciprocation. She only noticed everything I did when I stopped doing them, and then she was so angry about it that all she could focus on was getting me to do all the things I used to do rather than realising I was pulling back because I felt neglected emotionally. She would always say that if I ""changed this"" or ""changed that"" about myself, then she would be more willing to show me affection or even care enough to ask me how my day went, but the list of things she wanted me to change kept growing and all the while she didn't want to change any unhealthy behaviours she had nor could she see the way she was treating me or admit any responsibility for her cold behaviour."

I think it's healthy to allow yourself to feel sad if you are sad, and if there are any positive coping mechanisms you know of that help you feel better (stuffie cuddles, colouring, games, etc.) then taking time to do those things for yourself definitely helps too but allow yourself to heal from this pain at your own pace. Just like physical injuries, depending on how deep the cut is you may be in pain for longer than if it were a shallow cut, but regardless you heal a little more and hurt a little less, and before you know it you'll be all better! 💖

On my mother's side of the family, multiple generations of my family members have been known to be able to see and interact with spirits! And though Im unsure that I myself have ever seen a spirit, I know definitely that I had quite a few premonition dreams when I was a child and actually my first memory is of a premonition I had when I was 2! 

But other than the one I had when I was 2 (which was of my parents coming home to pick me up from my grandmother's after my little sister passed away) I've only ever had premonitions about useless things like dropping my binder in school 😅. 

Anyways!! I believe it's possible for a strong psychic ability/6th sense like this to be a genetic trait of sorts and I think it's super neat (:"
