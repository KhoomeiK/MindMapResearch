rpg,fqcs2fg,t1_fmqdwnl,1589267071.0,"I been leading Kult for a bit over a year now. I've been leading games for 20 years and Kult is by FAR the hardest game to lead if you want to do it well. It's not about ""Boo scary monster"" it's giving them the puzzle pieces over a long several games, when they organically figure out they have to die to ""win"" (although there is no win to get, but they don't know that). Tripping in behind the veil on the upper levels for the first time (if you do it  well) can be a bit creepy but it only get's worse. 

My players have been playing pnp rpgs for a long long while and they managed to really get into it just because it's so strange. 

The world really works best when you start with players that never played Kult before, start as sleepers and bring in the weird stuff slowly. Things my players experienced in the first month of playing is making sense now a year later. 

Due to the multiple ""dimensions"" and not using all of them in one campaign or set of characters; the same, now experienced , players can get mystified yet again by just chancing what world to interact with. They know a bit about the Machine city? Well, here is a Dream World, or Gaia. 

The world is absolutely huge and you might have to keep track on several of them at any moment. It's exhausting to lead a game, feels like a mental workout. That might just be me though.

I recommend getting the ""KULT: Divinity Lost – Taroticum"" with or without the actual cards. Use the first adventure as a base and build your expanded world around that.
