I came across your post and I'm begging you to reconsider leaving us.  Your parent, brother, dolls, cat and words need you to stay here, I don't even know you, would like to and I want you to stay here.  I would love to hear you words, there are plenty of days that I need to sing a song to get me through the day, why can't it be your words? Not sure if can change your mind, but just so you know, I'm a stranger that wants you to lie....so how bout' trying?"
