socialanxiety,eyefp3o,t3_cwqzyy,1567033137.0,"You could always just say that you have nothing to say and leave it at that. A lot of the times, people don't understand why someone is quiet. They're generally an unstoppable chatterbox and can't imagine not being a part of a conversation or what have you."

I don't mind it as much anymore. I've come to the conclusion that I'm just a very boring person."
PS4,ewvoq2v,t1_ewvn9wq,1565810777.0,"Oh so I wasn't crazy. I really did see Dead Island 2 before LOL.

Do people not care for it, I wonder? Considering there's a bunch of other zombie games out there??"
PS4,ewvmyhr,t3_cqa86h,1565809681.0,"You know, I didn't think a SR5 was actually going to be a thing, but I'm so excited. I enjoyed the series (though 4 was up and down for me, I still found some parts enjoyable), so hopefully 5 will be good.  


Dead Island 2....I'm....surprised they're coming out with a second one. Wasn't a fan of it, but I'm also not that big of a fan of zombie games to begin with..."
ffxiv,ewkilec,t3_coponz,1565485423.0,*ahhhhhhhh* I want to attune to it so badly!
PS4,ewkiecl,t1_ewhos6w,1565485270.0,"Ah I see, I see. The combat defintely looks interesting...  


Well the only issue I seem to be having curretnly is that I think the UI is too wide for my screen (everything is cut off). I'm not sure if it's the game or my tv settings. I can't adjust it, I might just drop it just because I can't see the text or teh buttons my screen lol."
PS4,ewgstn4,t3_co166j,1565389594.0,"I am an MMO baby; playing FFXIV for 4 and a half years and I have been hearing mixed things about Black Desert Online. I'm very much drawn to the character creator and the combat, but would this be something worth playing?   


(I'm downloading the demo as we speak.)"
depression,ewglnjn,t3_co4r6g,1565384665.0,Yes and it's gotten to the point where i have to take my anxiety meds 2-3 times a week. Trying to manually calm my brain down and tell myself everything is fine and there's nothing to worry about *really* does not work out for me.
retail,ewglk2s,t3_cnuy8z,1565384599.0,"I had a lady get upset at me because she thought she gave me the correct change (her totaly was something like 25.75 but she gave me 26.05), got upset that she didn't the change she wanted back and proceeded to throw the 3 cents at my face.

&#x200B;

Old women and lose change just don't seem to mix well for whatever reason lmao ;;"
infj,ewgl96y,t3_co1cfs,1565384397.0,"Same. I always have my phone on vibrate just because hearing my ringtone makes me anxious (even though I personally took the time to download a ringtone from game I just finished playing), so I've had it on vibrate....and even then it still makes me anxious.  


Agreeing with most of the people on this thread, I do think it is just a common trait us introverts share and not necessarily isolated to just INFJs."
depression,euo2476,t3_cgujfp,1563936371.0,This is totally me. It's like I'm not allowed to show any sort of negative emotion whatsoever. Sorry for being human.
retailhell,ethf3kq,t3_cbg8w7,1562813741.0,"I honestly think it's because they know us retail employees are going to put it back anyway so they just leave it there. It's honestly annoying. If there's anything I don't want, I turn my butt around and put it right back where I got it. I don't understand why it's such a hard concept for people."
depression,esb1l4h,t1_esb12jj,1561775305.0,"Yeah.. Technology can be a blessing and a curse haha.

Yeah, cutting off unhealthy people can definitely relieve some stress. I haven't tried laying down on the floor yet but I can see how that can be comforting....


Tea and a quiet place to sit and look out the window sometimes helps but if I sit still too long around quiet, I tend to think too much *shrugs*"
retail,es8bsn7,t3_c6f2u1,1561692903.0,Just let them know what happened. It was an accident! You should be fine.
infj,es8358s,t3_c6dw0v,1561686745.0,"I really don't think it's a thing us infjs can stop doing. It's a part of us and it can be both a blessing and a curse. It can definitely feel lonely at times when people don't understand you or look at you funny because of it (I've dealt with it my whole life and am still dealing with it now), but I think instead of trying to learn how to stop, embrace it instead."
retailhell,es82wfk,t3_c6cpa4,1561686579.0,"I've had a customer tell me that once and then add, ""do I get a special discount for that?"" I just looked at them, gave them my fake customer service smile and told them their total.

I... dont know if it's just a really random way to start a conversation or what, but it's just as annoying as hearing, ""I just printed those this morning"" in regards to them watching you use a counterfeit pen on said large bill(s) ðŸ™„"
retailhell,es7rehh,t3_c662ik,1561677804.0,"I used to work at a game store for about a year  and I had parents buy M games for children often. Store policy was to let the parent know that the game is rated M and mention what it contains. I had a parent getting ready to purchase Grand Theft Auto and Saints Row 3 for their 9 year old and after explaining to them that the game is rated M and what it explicitly contained (was able to do so more with Saints Row that GTA because I'm a fan of the Saints Row series), she turned red in the face, apologized, grabbed her child by the wrist and angrily stormed out the store.

You think it would be common sense to go on YouTube or Google the contents of the game or look at a trailer before a parent goes to a game store to buy their kid a game. While I understand a lot of excuses are ""they're old enough"" or ""I played rated m games when I was (insert age here)"", it's not really an excuse to start letting their kids be exposed to that kind of things because they want to be cool or whatever it is. It's really disappointing that parents don't seem to want to put in the effort to research the games their young kids are wanting to buy."
depression,erucxfa,t1_ertzr3a,1561272910.0,"I try to write things down in my phone; especially if it's passwords to things. It's not the safest place to put it but I really do find myself not remembering anything. As for conversations with other people, I try to speak slowly (I have a bad habit of speaking too fast) so that they understand me and so that I briefly remember what it was that I said to them (a lot of the times I still don't but it's better then nothing).

It's not perfect and my brain fog gets worse the older I get, but these are just some small things that I do to help me."
depression,ere8eb7,t3_c1lysh,1560777061.0,"I'm 28 and I have been experiencing this for as long as I rmemeber. I used to be able to write really well, had a wide vocabulary read and draw constantly. Now? I can barely finish my sentences (or form them), I don't have the attention span to read anymore and my creativity has evaporated. Hell, I have a hard time remembering my passwords to sites I've been visiting for years. 

Just yesterday, I forgot the password to my computer. 

It honestly really sucks."
