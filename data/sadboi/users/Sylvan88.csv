AMA,fqptb7w,t3_gk8ys1,1589553589.0,"How to stop reacting in anger and instead react with a positive response like laugh. Example: stub toe, kid destroys just cleaned living room, lost something I just had in my hand a minute ago, make a simple mistake. Instead of reacting with anger example: slam foot, slam cabinet closed, yell, uhg really loud, yell at kid even though I know a better way to handle it, break something, hit self in the head. I want to laugh it off like I used to be able to do. Stub a toe, laugh about how clumsy I am. kid destroys just cleaned living room, don't angry clean but talk to kid about keeping it clean and do the clean up song together happy. I feel like a lot of it comes from having to do things non stop (I have 3 kids 4, 2, and 1) and a crumbling house (floor coming up, roof leaking, kitchen cabinets falling off and countertop is crumbling causing the sink to leak water with every use. And my husband thinks i don't do enough and that he does most of the work (far from true but there is no convincing him) and that I am just wrong and bad bc I don't react with smiles and flowers to every problem. That I just need to clean less and play with the kids more and do everything faster."
confessions,fpxhso6,t1_fpxal7a,1588982891.0,"I think that if it does become sexual to you you will know. For now though it isn't and you aren't doing anything wrong. It seems to me that in looking for community you had trouble finding one that didn't make it sexual. Keep searching though, I have a feeling you will feel much more ""normalized"" in your want to be a little. People can make anything sexualized, eating drinking using the toilet heck trying on shoes can be sexualized. Doesn't make the act a sexual one just because it can be. Just do your best to do mental checks like taking note if what does exited you sexually and if those things are straying towards your world of wanting to be treated like a little. And even if it does it still might not mean that every aspect of being a little is now sexual to you. Like looking at a beautiful person and saying ""wow they are beautiful!"" Vs looking at a beautiful person and saying ""I want to have sex with them"". It's different aspects of a similar thing. Maybe the diapering part is the only aspect that is sexual to you, while the cuddling and feelings of safety are purely mental. I really hope you are able to find your community. I had a similar experience with something different and finding my community helped a lot. The acceptance and education I got was so valuable. In the mean time just do your best not to be hard on yourself."
confessions,fpx0u8n,t3_gfyzl0,1588973533.0,"I think more information is needed to know if this is gross or not. Is it something sexual to you? Or is it more like just being who you feel you are. I mean trans people don't get off of being a different gender from their born gender (sorry if I am saying this wrong I don't mean to offend anyone, please correct me if I am saying this offensively). They want to be treated as their chosen gender because that is who they feel they are and how they identify themselves. I like to imagine it like if everyone treated me like a lizard but I felt like a duck how would that make me feel. That would suck imo. So if it isn't sexual for you and more of an identity thing then I think you should probably talk to people in the community (just be safe) for advice on the situation. If it is sexual for you then I'd say you should prioratize finding a solution and try to keep yourself distant. Depending on how your parents are you could explain to them in little detail that you are struggling with sexual urges and that you are looking for help in dealing with them. If your parents are the supportive kind they could be helpful in finding you help. You don't have to tell them details, just say you aren't comfortable talking to them about it but you do want to talk to someone.  
  
Just know you aren't a bad person for having urges. The fact you questioned it or think it's wrong says you aren't being a bad person. You just need some help and guidance."

AmItheAsshole,fmv6j09,t3_fxbnct,1586407394.0,"NTA. It's called taking initiative. There is no reason to try harder or meet higher goals if there isn't any possibility of better rewards. Boy A was doing that and got rewarded, B wasn't. It should have been told to everyone that he would get extra for taking more initiative in helping and being helpful in general, so they can see his example and strive to better themselves as well. I wouldn't listen to this sub for parenting advice. It's pretty bad. If you are unsure then utilize your resources and ask a professional such as a child development specialist (or their school psychologist, or their teacher even). Every family is different and have their own ways of doing things. It is good to encourage positive behavior but if you are encouraging one of your children to parent then that isn't okay. I would need more context to make that sort of judgment though. Based on what you said it seems you aren't trying to have your son parent but you are encouraging him to take initiative. Being an extrovert or introvert doesn't mean you should not encourage that. There is no need to set limits on kids by saying ""oh he is an introvert so I won't try to encourage him to take more initiative"". Please consult someone from their school though, the advice on here is very misguided and some is just down right mean. You don't want to be making parenting decisions because some kid on reddit felt attacked because they are an introvert and wanted to call you an ass."

JUSTNOMIL,fmbbot2,t1_fmbaajo,1585923052.0,"We spoke about it but not very in depth. It was more so ""I won't go through what I went through with our first child where you couldn't even help me hold up my leg when it was time to push. The nurses had to keep an eye on you because you looked like you were going to pass out and we're wobbling and going limp."" This was also out 3rd child and my mother and sister were there for number 2 and when it started going down hill he went and sat down while my mom and sister came to my side to help. We discussed if I had an emergency c section it would be my mom but that I would do everything possible to avoid c section. So he took that as ""so it won't happen"" because somehow I can do that. He was upset after but knew better than to say a word about it too me because he knew I was up to me. It hey him that he want the person I wanted/needed in that room but he understood that it wasn't my fault he couldn't be that person for me. His parents though didn't agree. But that's fine because they also knew not to bring it up to me because they know I don't put up with any nonsense.  
  
Thank you for the no judgment :) it was an easy decision for me to make mostly because I had 2 vaginal births before that and was able to draw from those experiences. Without that I probably wouldn't have been so confident in my decision. I also had a rough time during my pregnancy when it came to getting support from my husband, so it made it easier to not give a hoot how it hurt him.

I didn't want them to see me in pain and he didn't get that and kept dismissing me saying ""it will only be for a minute, they are passing us anyway. They are doing us a favor staying with the kids"" and I just said I don't care. If they want to hold that over us and force me to do something I am not comfortable with then they are shitty people and can shove their ""kindness"" where the sun doesn't shine. My mom and sister where there with my husband and that was what I wanted. We had an emergency c section and I chose my mother to come and not my husband.

Decorating the crib with pillows blankets stuffed toys etc. Also by cosleeping you can tell if baby stopped breathing on their own. In my experience I honestly felt my kids were safest when they slept with me. I did catch one stop breathing on his own in the night soon after he was born. We had the crib as an option but it never fit into our lives. One of our children actually had a fear of it and would nonstop cry till they vomited then keep going.

Yes people should get treatment, in the various forms that exist there are tons of potential for help. Economic political etc strains that can lead someone to suicidal thoughts can be helped by getting treatment (talk therapy) because they can learn the mechanisms they need to be better able to cope with their circumstances. There are always people who have had it worse and have gotten through it. The story of hope stays strong despite your obvious attempts to overshadow them in doubt.  
  
You sound just like an antivaxxer. I send you the numbers and you talk about how it isn't valid in your opinion. Nothing anyone says is going to change your thoughts on this bc you are bias. Your goal isn't to help it's to make suicide okay. Which it never will be. Like pedofiles trying to gain acceptance or antivaxxers trying to make it okay to allow their kids to die from preventable diseases. Your in a rabbithole and your argument hasnt stood on its own 2 feet since your very first post on here. That's why you need to claim my argument is somehow failing. Despite your lack of actual proof any of it isn't true. I truly hope you get the support and help you need. I won't have your life on my conscience. I can lead a horse to water but the horse has to drink it. There are cases of involuntary hold being abused but in no way is it abuse if they are holding someone who actually needs it. Your wrong to think otherwise. The countless testimony of people who have gone through that will be meaningless to you because it won't fit your narrative. Go call a suicide prevention hotline and I guarantee you they will be able to give you much better information on the success rates as well as overall outcomes that exceed your bogus claims of a few redditors that are also just looking to make their own suicide acceptable. It will never be okay to kill yourself. Just the fact that you would do that to your mother, father, anyone that ever loved or cared about you is despicable and makes you the lowest of the low. Anyone that would take a child from their mother or father is a monster. Even if it is the child themselves. You wouldn't be ending your own life. You would be ending theirs too. Not fighting to save them and yourself and trying every possible thing to keep them from that pain should be too priority. Not looking for acceptance on Reddit. Waste of time and honestly it is very disingenuous. You aren't fighting for suicidal people or for people in shitty situations to have better lives. You are fighting to make it ok to do what you want at the expense of others. Don't pretend you are the morally correct one in this when the truth is staring you in the face. Stop talking people over the ledge and realize what you are doing. Convincing people it is okay to kill themselves is murder."

So yeah. Not the same. Yes there is a chance of being involuntary hold but it isn't a ""gamble"" to get mental health as you claim. There is a risk, a chance, of being held. Not a certainty as you seem to be making it out to be. It is well worth it to take that risk than give up. Which is the opposite of getting help. Doing nothing or giving up is the opposite. Your explanations all just reinforce my belief that you are looking for justification for suicide by skewing the truth. You realize it's also illegal to promote suicide right? In the U.S.A. Which is what you are doing. Saying it's better to kill yourself than get treatment is promoting suicide. This isn't a debate of who is right or wrong. It's just wrong to promote or encourage suicide. If you ever talk to someone who is suicidal just don't talk to them and move far far away. Their life should 100% not be in your hands."

2meirl4meirl,fiajtsm,t1_fia6grr,1582302521.0,">The problem with this argument is that it assumes that you can insist that everyone should try something SOLELY because SOME people had a positive result, that's literally paramount to gambling.

Gambling does not favor the gambler, and the odds are geared towards the house. Hospitals do need to make a profit, yes. But they won't be making any profit if they aren't helping people get better because they would get shut down. The pattern of people either returning or not improving would be seen by insurance companies or the government (depending on who is paying) and it would be investigated. There are many checks and balances these days especially when it comes to money going towards treatment in healthcare. Involuntary commitment is still paid for, if not by the person it is paid for by other organizations who hold onto the debt for the facility so the facility can get paid and can continue to run. So these hospitals, treatment centers, or private doctors or therapists were made to have the best success rates and results for their patients. There will always be outliers but overall they are geared towards the patient winning, not ""the house"". So no it is nothing like gambling. It is a risk that they can be held against their will, yes, but it is still in the best interest of that person and not in the best interest of the facility to falsely commit someone in order to get more money. The backlash from the accusations and with social media being able to take down huge companies these days it is not in their best interest.  
  

>Is it now being established that you're saying here can be boiled down to the idea that as long as there is a chance of something then people should try/hold on waiting to find out? This is not a feasible line of logic.

How is it not feasible? Winning the lottery has very low odds and so does gambling. But getting mental help is vastly different. If you are trying to play the odds game then mental help has much better odds of success over doing nothing. That's as if you cut your arm and said ""well there's nothing I can do about that!"" When you could go to a doctor and get it cleaned out to promote healing and get stitches to help it heal correctly. Doing nothing has the worst odds, even worse than winning to lotto or gambling, because they are basically zero.  
  


>people who are depressed because of political/economic/social issues that are not solved by pills, can't have pills/therapy thrown at them.

I have said multiple times I don't think it's right in unjustly involuntarily hold someone, but I also accept that as humans we make mistakes. I also accept that people that DO need to be involuntarily committed will not want to be as well. There are people who need it, because if they weren't they would go off and kill someone or they will try to kill themselves and take out a bunch of people with them. There are some people who need extreme help, and involuntary commitment is the only way they can get it. Bipolar is a good example. Manic depressive bipolar. Schizophrenia is a big one that can manifest in makes in their late 20s early 30s. It isn't easy to tell if a person is behaving some way because of political/economic/social issues or because of chemical imbalances or phycological abuse. But the best way to demonstrate you don't fall into those categories is to look at what they are saying is not good and look to get help or at least show you are looking into what has them alarmed instead of dismissing it as not a problem or none of their business.  
  


>True, it's not the only reason suicide prevention exists, it's just a very common/easily arguable reason that exists that allows me to expose how biased and invalid ""suicide prevention"" reasons are

It is an easy argument. ""They are out to get me!"" Is a common argument used in many different situations. Like antivaxxers. As well as many incarcerated people. That doesn't make it valid. Yes the medical industry is a money making industry like all the others, but the difference is not all of it comes from the person getting the services. Depending on your country of course. With free healthcare in a good number of countries there are a lot of checks and balances that go towards stopping over treatment or unnecessary treatment. They don't want to spend money on involuntary holds that aren't necessary. It works as a checks and balances system to keep anyone from gaming the system for more money. There are also a ton of laws and plenty of lawyers who love their shot at making a big fat cut on any malpractice or abuse of power made by the medical field professionals. These lawyers will work for free when they see a case is going to likely get a payout. Which is a huge deterrent for medical professionals to even try gaming the system and abusing their power. Not that it doesn't happen.  
  
To say that getting help for suicidal thoughts is not worth it because the odds are equal to or worse than gambling and winning the lottery is just plain misinformed and comes across more like a justification of action rather than a feasible argument for it. Heck the amount of pain that person's death will cause to their loved one(s) alone isn't worth it. If they have no loved ones it still should not be to go to answer."
2meirl4meirl,fiajo7b,t1_fia6grr,1582302431.0,">Also, the conditions of human quality of life are extremely individual and cannot be generalized/insisted as in any way collectively improving, even across different time periods.

I think it can be. There was a time where slavery existed as a norm. Yes it is still around today to some degree but it is NOT a norm. Women used to have no rights, bit now they are not only given rights but equality is IMPROVING. Before vaccinations people would get sick and die of things we now rarely ever see. These are vast improvements that has changed the world on such a grand scale that it truly has touched every single person. The overall positive result these changes caused outweighs the bad (slavers couldn't use slaves for work anymore, but they aren't being beaten or treated as slaves). There our so many examples of these things that show things can get better and will continue to do so as long as people continue to fight the good fight.  
  


>A medieval royalty noble could have lived a life of relative comfort, but some young kid growing up in the 2000's might be born into nonstop sexual and physical abuse/poverty/housing insecurity/etc.

Even a medieval Noble living in relative comfort could never reach the levels of comfort we have today. Our healthcare (even shitty expensive healthcare) is vastly better than anything you could have gotten back then. The fact that you can get treatment at all even if you are homeless is a huge step up from what a homeless person back in medieval times had. There are areas of the world that are undeveloped so healthcare isn't as easy as in developed countries, but that is the difference. There ARE developed countries. They are spreading. Undeveloped countries have organizations like the red Cross or doctors without borders that go there and help. That was never a possibility back then. There actually is hope now. Yes maybe it costs money you don't have or you will get loaded with debt, but it at least exists now. Back then you could get sick and die without even knowing what was going on. Don't even get me started on how rampant abuse both physical and mental was back then. Now it is not a norm to accept that sort of thing. If someone strikes a kid in the street people don't just go ""he deserved he for not listening"" they look at the hitter like wtf. At least it is more so the norm, obviously there are places (like China) where gets get ran over and no one bats an eye. But that is not what happens 100% of the time. Where is stuff like that was much more common in history. Things are improving which causes more people's lives to improve. Even if it caused others to worsen it isn't a direct inverse relationship. One person's life improves by 10 and a others worsens by 5 so to speak.  
  


>poor people getting killed by poverty wages/unaffordable housing/etc literally don't have time to wait for ""improvement"" when they could instead just opt for suicide instead

So homeless people should kill themselves rather than be homeless. People used to live in tents before modern housing existed. It definitely isn't as nice as modern housing but I highly doubt the cavemen were thinking of killing themselves rather than live in a cave. It is a shitty situation but death doesn't make it better. It just makes it over. There are homeless shelters and resources, and if there aren't where they are then they are homeless. That doesn't mean their lives aren't worth living anymore. It's about how they cope with their situation. There are always people who have had it worse and rose above it. It may be easier not to but then you are accepting that you'd rather die than keep trying. Leave where you are then, another country another city, maybe one in a warmer climate or a country with better healthcare. You can't say ""there's no way to get there!"" Because people do it. They get there even if they aren't supposed to. Illegal immigrants looking for a better life cross the dessert or die trying to cross the sea.  
  


>Yes, if everyone suffering killed themselves, there would be no improvement, this however does not establish any reason for people to allow themselves to suffer endlessly for ""improvement""

This sounds like entitlement more than reason. ""Why should I have to do this when it's someone else's job!"" Because it effects that person that's why. You aren't ""suffer(ing) endlessly"" for improvement. You can be suffering in your current situation, but trying to improve it isn't making your suffering endless. It feels endless till it ends. Like ""it's always in the last place I look!"" Because you found it. It's not like someone has to suffer endlessly to improve things for everyone else, they are fighting the fight to improve their own life as well. Look at all the women who were prosecuted for fighting for women's rights. They did it for themselves and it benefitted the future of women as well. Obviously they did it for future women as well as themselves but it wasn't just for others.  
  


>It's a pretty fucking bad idea to assume that it's okay to medicalize depression and just throw drugs/therapy at everything in a desperate political attempt to dodge/evade confronting how some people suffer because of political/economic/social causes and how not everything can be chalked up to a clinical problem

I agree that medication isn't always the answer, but in tough times therapy is definitely helpful. Especially before it gets too bad. Having someone to talk to and keep your mind focused on healthy thoughts and goals is always a good idea when times are tough. A good therapist isn't going to commit you for being depressed or because you got fired and are having a tough time with it. Granted this does happen and I have seen it myself, but there are laws there are guidelines that must be followed. If you go in kicking and screaming at injustice you are not going to be taken seriously. Talking to them and explaining what's going on and trying to remain calm is the best option if the goal is to get out or get help. If the goal is to vent out your frustrations with the current situation then you do need therapy because you need to learn the healthy way to do that. I will state again though I DO NOT BELIEVE IT IS OKAY TO HOLD PEOPLE AGAINST THEIR WILL. But I do allow for humanity, which is for mistakes to be made BUT PEOPLE TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE for those mistakes so they learn from them. I also am for involuntary holding when it is a person who is undeniably a danger to others. You should see how bad it can get when these people are not properly taken care of by professionals. I worked in a adult group hold for people who had mental disabilities and they truly needed to be there. If there was no involuntary holding they would have no support for the things they need in order to have a good quality of life by their definition.  
  
 

>Why should anyone allow themselves the risk of being sent unwillingly when they could opt for suicide before they can be threatened with involuntary force or threatened/coerced into going ""willingly""?

My statement was about going willingly in the first place, not about someone being told they have to go willingly or they will be forced. If someone is having suicidal thoughts seeing a therapist first to talk about it is a good first step. Being honest and open to treatment is not going to result in someone being committed against their will. These professionals always aim for voluntary commitment. There are many studies showing that voluntary has better results than involuntary. Of course I'll say again there are bad docs out there and bad things are possible, but that is not the norm or even a common situation. It happens yes but so does murder and robbery and abuse. That doesn't define the whole of it as bad. It just tells you to be mindful as you always should be.  
  


>Engaging with the mental health system is not a game that you can just opt into to ""see what all the fuss is about"" when you are now at risk of having your option to walk away/say no taken away from you.

That is the problem, it is being seen as ""this can only take my option away"" instead of ""this could help me not want that option anymore."" Which ultimately should be the goal. To be able to cope with the life you have in a way that is positive and helps you strive for better rather than accepting the worst and chosing to end it. If the fear of getting help is that the person won't be able to go back to killing themselves then the current goal isn't about happiness it's about dying. Which is also a form of depression that can be medicated. There are types of depression that are caused by chemical imbalances that can result in thoughts of death being happy ones. This is why it is good to try and see a therapist, because they have knowledge on things that people without their schooling don't have. Even if it is about your own mind there is much more at play than thoughts and feelings alone. Granted there are situations where it has nothing to do with chemical imbalances, but even then a therapist will know things the person does not. Like coping strategies or healthy ways to deal with emotions. Especially for victims of any form of abuse or neglect. Or even people without that who just didn't have parent(s) who knew how to teach their children more than how to exist. It is very common especially now with there being so much focus on emotional development in children. It wasn't the case even 20 years ago. Kids these days are being taught much better emotional techniques then they used to. There is a new level of understanding that has really made great strides for these kids. But that doesn't help the adults that were raised without any of that."
2meirl4meirl,fia2fuh,t1_fi9lfq5,1582291157.0,"I see your point in a lot of this, but something to note is that times have been hella worse before. Not saying there isn't still plenty to be sad about but there have been way worse times in history than there are currently. Things are working towards improvement it just takes time and a shit ton of support. If everyone that is being impacted by bad shit killed themselves wouldn't there be no improvement? If there is no one complaining or fighting the badness then why would there be any improvement? I think some have it worse than others yeah but I also think some people aren't able to cope as well as others. Two people in the same situation can have totally different reactions, one coping and overcoming it and the other killing themselves. If therapy or meds are able to help that other person cope better then maybe it isn't a bad idea. Obviously that is a pretty big generalization but my point is that it doesn't hurt to try. Why go unwillingly when you can go willingly and see what the fuss is about? Worst that happens is you go in and rack up a bunch of debt you don't have to worry about bc you can still just end it like you originally planned. But at least you tried the ""normie"" way to a degree. I also get the whole ""they just wanna make money off me that's why they want me alive!"" But that can't be the only reason these suicide prevention practices started. That's like saying ""big pharma just wants everyone to get vaccinated so everyone can get vaccine injury so they can make more money off them!""  
  
Having said all that I support everyone's right to choose for themselves, I just feel it is a waste to not even try all the logical solutions. If a pill or therapy has helped others be able to cope and be happy in their lives enough to stay alive then isn't it worth at least trying? There are plenty of people who have been involuntarily committed who did have good results, as in they are alive and happy they didn't kill themselves. Not saying that is always what happens, but the chance of it means you are overlooking an option and instead looking to just be done trying. Which leads me to think maybe it's moreso depression than logical reasoning and depression can be helped with a pill."
