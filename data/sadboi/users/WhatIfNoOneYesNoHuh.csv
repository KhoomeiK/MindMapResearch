You need extreme amounts of dexterity and skill, just to be a disassembly-line butcher (about a year of 6 day, 10 hour shifts to become decent)

You will be humiliated by racist Karen-type office workers.

The barbarians that ended up stuck with these jobs, usually were excons and undocumented immigrants. If even those two demographics quit: you are fucked through and through. 

They tried bringing Indians, Africans, and Caribbeans on work visas. Once they got a taste, they all fucking called their embassies to have their asses flown back home, not even they wanted to put up with decomposing livers splashing them inside their pretty little mouths.The Sudanese and Pacific Islanders however have my utmost respect.

Guns are a lot of liability, especially when carried on one's person. Even if you use the gun correctly, — in a situation like the one you describe, you are still looking at expensive attorney fees and civil lawsuits. This is explained in any decent basic pistol /firearm class, as well as the topics you mentioned. 

On a personal note, there is enough well-intentioned but poorly-written legislation in place already. IMO, all it does is make second ammendment rights hard to reach for marginalized communities. I'm a newly minted permanent resident from Mexico. It is amazing to be able to have the means to defend myself and those I care about; but every new law introduced makes these rights it more expensive to afford.
