Picture yourself sitting in front of a panel of experienced Doctors in your interview, talking about how your physician didn’t do a good job, and you know what your physician should’ve done, when you don’t know what being a physician is like yet.

You will be grateful he showed his true colors before you committed the rest of your life to being him.

Congratulations on your acceptance and scholarship. You have a bright future ahead of you, career-wise and relationship-wise. You're moving on to bigger and better things and you won't have this person, who is no longer worth your time, weighing you down. Take care of yourself and be kind to yourself. If therapy is accessible to you, then find a therapist asap. It will take time to grieve this loss, and you're allowed to take all the time you need and feel whatever you need to feel.

Edit: I'm not saying I know what you're going through, but I was coldly and suddenly dumped by someone I loved 20 minutes before I got the email that I was accepted to Duke for grad school. It was confusing time, because the only person I wanted to celebrate with was him. I didn't even get to tell him. I felt empty. Looking back, I'm glad he let me go. I was about to start planning my life around a person who didn't really care about me. Blessing in disguise."

It is puzzling. I guess it’s low self-esteem. You want to be validated by the person that treated you like garbage to make you feel less like garbage. Because no matter how great other people are to you, you still remember that one person you loved and respected thought of you as garbage.

I blocked him, immediately. And still I secretly hoped he would reach out. Blocking is a good start, but it doesn’t solve everything and moving on and healing takes time."

And even if they’re just stating it like a fact with no judgement or admiration, I don’t know how to respond to that other than “yep”

I cried and told him I felt manipulated and pointed out how much of this information he withheld from me while he was giving me very different signals, like introducing me to his dad and continuing to sleep with me. I cried, begged, then eventually told him that was it, and that no, we couldn’t remain friends. He called me the next morning crying and told me he still wanted to be with me. I guess my crying worked the first time, but maybe it never should have. That’s probably why the second time we broke up he did it over the phone with an emotionless voice. So yeah, the outcome does vary. Seeing him cry about the relationship showed me he cared about it.

He never let me in on how he was feeling, either time. I’m not a mind reader and I’m never going to react well to being completely blindsided. I need someone who will communicate with me.

He did it very coldly and the experience was really degrading and dehumanizing. He treated me like I suddenly wasn’t even a person. It was traumatic. This is cringeworthy but I told him I loved him on that phone call. Because I really did, and I just had to tell him. That was the first and only time I’ve told someone that. And there was just silence. And I asked him if he ever felt that way about me?. And all he said was “That’s not fair”. It hurt so badly. I’ve regretted doing that because I feel like I robbed myself of my first experience with that. But I would have regretted not telling him. I did the best I could with what I knew at the time.

It’s a blessing in disguise that he won’t be involved in the the start of this new chapter. You’ve dodged a bullet and you get to start fresh. He would’ve shown his true colors eventually, and starting this next chapter with him would’ve been a waste.

I feel for you. I’m not saying my situation was the same as yours, but I was dumped right when I was at a crossroads in my life.

Dear Examinee, 

We know how greatly your life has been disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and to say that this is a frustrating and challenging time is an understatement. Preparing for the MCAT exam and applying to medical school takes sustained effort and careful planning over several years. The challenges of COVID-19 have regrettably made it difficult to provide more information to you sooner as you make plans to take the MCAT exam. We thank you for your patience and are glad to share these updates that will help you move forward with your plans for taking the MCAT exam and applying to medical school.

**1.) Registration for the updated** [**2020 MCAT Testing Calendar**](https://click.email.aamc.org/?qs=fb58eb1bcc9103dbdae9c0ec1e4347ac10cf6a8653c0bc04468dbe8869e52eeea666708e1a1e7bfcb9612a9576214686ee38c0ae37cb98b9) **will open on May 7, 2020. Please visit our** [**website**](https://click.email.aamc.org/?qs=fb58eb1bcc9103dbcebdebfdff5d8e8781520461526a62d430b44413f238e569587c3b9c1f732a594377ee0a6cf35506351080d58d4508fc) **for more information.**

**2.) We are increasing the number of test appointments in an attempt to provide enough seats for everyone who wants to test in 2020 and to allow for safe social distancing practices in the test centers.**

* Three new dates will be added to the testing calendar (June 28, September 27, and September 28).
* Exams will be held three times per day on all test dates for the remainder of 2020. Standard start times will be 6:30 a.m., 12:15 p.m., and 6:00 p.m. each day. There may be some variations by test center. More information about start times, including start times for examinees who currently have 8:00 a.m. appointments, will be provided prior to registration opening.

**3.) We are temporarily shortening the exam to 5 hours and 45 minutes for the remainder of 2020 test dates to accommodate the number of appointments offered per day at each test center.**

* Some of the field test questions in each section have been removed, and some administrative items, such as the tutorial and the end-of-day survey, have been reduced or removed to shorten the length of the exam.
* We encourage you to use the online “Practice with MCAT Exam Features” tool to familiarize yourself with the exam functionality prior to test day in lieu of the tutorial. Visit the free resources section of the [MCAT Official Prep Hub](https://click.email.aamc.org/?qs=fb58eb1bcc9103dba1fdfd41a23fbf4580312841c411e991ae8cd214c799b10a5ce4f6ed41753ae1bef5b5d11c5dba6c607ff794ed0c730c).
* The exam will not be easier or harder than the full-length exam. You will still be tested on all four sections of the exam and are responsible for knowing the same concepts and skills covered on the full-length exam.
* Scores are not changing. You will receive five scores from the exam: one from each of the four sections and one combined total score, just like examinees who took the full-length test.
* Please visit our [website](https://click.email.aamc.org/?qs=fb58eb1bcc9103db095b38653d5e274176e927c0c456bc676c70d0662d25ea0e85434ff2b68ee7375f457a252d1180a5f9b4672d4860ca14) to learn more about the shortened exam and access helpful FAQs.

**4.) Scores will be reported within approximately two weeks for exams held from June 19 through August 1.** MCAT scores from other test dates will be reported to examinees and medical schools in the typical time frame, which is about four weeks.

**5.) Decisions will be made next week about the status of the May 29 exams and will be communicated by email.** We will continue to follow local and state health guidance to determine which locations will be affected. At this time we anticipate testing in some centers, but not all. 

**6.) Please keep in mind that as the spread of COVID-19 continues to be volatile, and testing may be affected in specific locations, according to the local health guidance.** The health and safety of every examinee is our priority, and it is possible examinees may need to reschedule their exam for another date if conditions are deemed unsafe by local authorities. Social distancing and health and safety measures will be in place at test centers when testing resumes. Please visit the Pearson VUE[website](https://click.email.aamc.org/?qs=fb58eb1bcc9103db6451e799fd747c8e17f55e84b5d736b0617300457e017778a59df419fba6d5125cc46fb68dc7dd2e244c010f2e699c5e) to learn more. 

**7.) All rescheduling fees have been waived for all exam dates for the 2020 MCAT testing year until further notice.**

**8.) The AAMC has been working closely with medical school admissions officers since the start of this pandemic, and they are very aware of the impact of COVID-19 on the admissions process and the delay of MCAT scores in students’ applications.** [AMCAS](https://click.email.aamc.org/?qs=fb58eb1bcc9103db16125e35e4b3b53e55c7f4a1c9b46df3381a11032cae8f43000b3d9a45f3d063559677806dd04b42c6c703ffcaeef17b) has also delayed transmitting applicant data to medical schools by two weeks (moving from June 26 to July 10) to give applicants more time to complete their applications. Medical schools will be flexible with their application deadlines and make their review processes as fair and equitable as possible during this unprecedented admissions cycle.

Please visit our [MCAT Coronavirus Page](https://click.email.aamc.org/?qs=fb58eb1bcc9103dbcebdebfdff5d8e8781520461526a62d430b44413f238e569587c3b9c1f732a594377ee0a6cf35506351080d58d4508fc) for more information and FAQs as well as other ways the AAMC can support you through the application process this year.

We are wishing you and your loved ones good health during this truly difficult time for our nation. As the next generation of physicians, you are needed now more than ever, and the AAMC is proud to support you at every step throughout your medical school journey.

Sincerely, 

The MCAT Program"

And what if I apply and my score is not what I needed....too bad since it'll be late July before I know!

In order for me to get to where I am now and ready to apply, I had to take a few gap years to improve my application. My GPA was lower than yours, so now I'm in a Master's program. I'm applying this cycle and don't know how it'll go yet, so I don't have great advice. I guess I just came here to say that yes, a career change to medicine feasible and you should go after what you want."

Imagine being a newish relationship right now....I would be feeling so insecure about them losing interest in me and the relationship. We wouldn't be able to go out. We wouldn't have new things to talk about. Both our careers would be on stand-still. Ugh. No thank you.

I'm so glad to be spending this time with just myself. I have no FOMO about all the things that come with maintaining romantic relationship right now."

It’s not like the university is totally open and running and people are going to classes; they are just letting students who have nowhere else to go to stay in the residence halls. It’s an essential service.

I work in on-campus housing at a very large university. Some of our students would be in very deep shit if we didn’t let the handful of people who needed to stay here, to stay here. We care about our students."

I do not know why now. It could be guilt, boredom, needs attention, needs an ego stroke. I really don’t know and I’m not going to ask him. I don’t need to know, it just doesn’t feel relevant to my life right now. But I’m fine to have a polite normal conversation.

I still think about it him everyday, but I can now envision a future where I don’t care anymore. And I can feel myself getting closer to that."
BreakUps,fio0ajm,t1_finyruq,1582573782.0,"I know that really dark feeling when you really can’t picture the future being any better, or even being able to picture a future at all. I was in that place for a long while. It’s hard to imagine when you’re in that place that there is more to feel. But there is. I was really resistant to try medication, until I got to rock bottom and said I was willing to try anything.

6 years is a long time, and time is definitely going to PART of your recipe for success. But it might not be the only missing thing in your recipe. 

I was at the point where I really just didn’t want to live anymore. I knew logically I wasn’t going to still be sad about this breakup 10 years from now. But I thought...if for over a year I’m really miserable to the point where I just don’t want to be here anymore, what kind of life is that?"
BreakUps,finxljc,t1_finod5d,1582572227.0,"They don’t change the thoughts or take them away, but they did help me stop sitting with those thoughts for long periods of time. I guess you could say the meds increased my recovery time from those thoughts and memories. The meds also allowed me to become interested in other things (like working out and playing the piano), so while I do still think about my ex, it’s not the centerpiece of my brain anymore."
BreakUps,finx3mj,t3_f8uzlb,1582571934.0,"I was still struggling over a year after my break up. I was already seeing a therapist and talked about the breakup with the therapist for like 8 months. At my therapists recommendation, I went and saw a psychiatrist and was diagnosed with depression and PTSD. Started meds and things did improve. Flashbacks happened less frequently and that empty feeling wouldn’t stick around for long periods of time.

It helped “take the edge off”, I suppose. I felt like I was past the relationship, but my body wasn’t letting me move on. I’m doing much better now. Life isn’t perfect, but is more manageable. I’m starting to enjoy things again and actually look forward to the future. I’d say I’m in a good place now and good things are on it’s way. 

For the first time since the break up, I’d say that I’m relatively happy. And what’s even more incredible, is that I’m happy on my own. No new relationship, no dating, no unhealthy coping behaviors. Just me and myself, working on sustaining healthy habits and working towards a career that will eventually lead to a better life."

And you’re right, I did feel that during the relationship. I thought I was happy, but each time I was turned away for connection, I felt empty...wondering if I was just asking for too much. He was this incredible person in my eyes, and I felt so lucky to be with him, and I never really felt like I was enough —and this behavior was why. I just didn’t see it."

nosurf,fd2jves,t3_eju2o9,1578148278.0,"You've done it before and you can do it again! You know from experience that it makes your happier. 

I think breaking down goals into smaller time frames can make things easier to stick to. Sometimes committing to ""the rest of your life"" can make things feel much harder. Maybe start with 2.5 months like you did this summer, then after that add 2.5 more months, and so on. You know yourself best though!"
