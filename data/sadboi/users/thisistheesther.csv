Anxiety,fkwkpz3,t3_fkrmra,1584595530.0,Thanks so much for this. It's totally terrifying and inescapable. But we will get through because what other choice is there
Anxiety,fkwkh57,t1_fkuf684,1584595303.0,"I have a new job as a manager of children's nurseries. I have no industry knowledge really but got the job on my gift of the gab and 3 months in I am really fucked.
I am competent enough to just about cope but holy shit the anxiety"
Coronavirus,fkwk7te,t1_fkwjt0n,1584595061.0,"Lots of bitter assumptions there. Some are, some aren't. Shit still fucked so might as well get more positive vibes on the go.
I hope the people you describe see what we are doing but it takes large scale change at this point. Our power is as consumers now"
Coronavirus,fkwj52r,t1_fkwggra,1584594075.0,"Agreed, but I think at this dark time, not helpful at all. Everyone is here together through this, and one. One person gone would not make any difference and if I weren't to be here it would bring more sadness than benefit.
We as an human race can definitely take this time to reflect on our impact though.

Not at all interested in feeding the troll but in case anyone else reads who is feeling overwhelmed like me"
Coronavirus,fkwiw1e,t1_fkwhian,1584593853.0,"Thank you. It really isn't much but its a help, for whatever to be honest.
It's the one thing that is keeping me going now, the blitz attitude we all seem to have in our genes"
Coronavirus,fkwgfji,t1_fkvqda0,1584591771.0,"I don't have a lot of money either but honestly the only way we survive this thing is helping, if only for my mental health . I am in the education sector and I see the effects. I can offer some toward a tablet. I don't have loads but I am lucky that what I have isn't needed to survive and I waste on shit . So send me a pm.
Or look into what eypp might be available just now if he is statemented 
I don't know if can be used for that but honestly right now who knows. 
Also speak to"
Coronavirus,fkwg0zj,t1_fkwfa1o,1584591450.0,No it's just a fact that us just stopping has been beneficial. Honestly the whole thing really sucks but I can't help but wonder if the planet had enough
