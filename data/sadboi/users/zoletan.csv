Also check how many internal USB's you have on your motherboard - I had only one on mine and you need to have Corsair AIO and RGB hub connected directly to USB on motherboard - I tried with a random internal USB splitter, and later with NZXT one that has additional power, and still it would not detect AIO, in the end I connected the AIO to 2.1 USB in NZXT hub"
