Hijabis,f5uow2f,t3_dpc15u,1572476905.0,"Brother here, Salaam. I too have terrible body dysmorphia. I was a very handsome dude growing up and was constantly being hit on by other Muslim girls (including many non-muslims as well). I felt on top of the world and pride entered my heart. I wasn't arrogant or rude but I flaunted what I had (which did not EARN btw; Its like a White Supremacist who is proud of being White while not realizing he could have easily been born a Black slave in the 1700s. We have ZERO control over this) but when I turned 19, my hair started falling off. Suddenly the opposite happened. Instead of compliments and attention, I was immediately made fun of (even by family members, which hurt the most). I had seemingly won the genetic lottery growing up for it all to be taken away from me when I was still young. I still had a great personality and can make an entire room laugh but I was suicidal inside. I tried to fake it whenever I was in a social situation. I hated myself all of a sudden. A blessing though was that I realized who my ""true"" friends and family members were, those who did not bully me. However, I got 2 hair transplants as my hair was really thin (it still is) because of the terrible depression I fell into due to the ridicule I faced constantly.  Being a 19 year old going bald (who was just recently handsome and extremely popular) was, to me, the end of the world. Over 10 grand spent on two lousy transplants that I justified Islamicaly to my parents (even though I was an Atheist at the time) because it was a ""deformity"" that was not supposed 2 happen this early was hard. I started stress eating as well and my once muscular 6foot frame became obese. I suddenly became ugly and poor. I turned into the bald, fat uncle but who was only in his 20s. The social phobia got really bad and I wasted years of my life in my room hiding rather than finishing college or hanging out with family and friends. At one point, I wouldn't even open the door to sign for a package that I myself ordered and wanted. Alhamdulillah, after being challenged by a Jehovah's Witness who rang my doorbell, I became interested in the concept of God and why ""Evil"" exists. Funny how Allah works isn't it?  Alhamdulillah after 2 yrs of intensive research into Islam, Allah guided me back. Now I see just how ""low"" the Dunya is and how bad it will end up. How superficial and materialistic people are and how the culture of ""YOLO"" is destroying people's Dunya AND Afterlife. Because of all this and my epiphany that I was granted, I say Alhamdulillah 4 the Fitnah Allah tested me with and continues 2 test me with. I see children born with diseases, in war zones, with much worse deformities than superficial hair-loss and am reminded of the saying: Look at those Below you in Dunya and above you in Deen. Part of the veil has been lifted from my eyes and I pity the masses that are just blind sheep themselves leading more blind sheep. Sheep People = Sheeple. I now get the urge to raise my future kids on a rural farm away from all this cancerous and fake reality (No way am I sending them to Public School). I stopped listening to music and watching the evil TV that indoctrinated me to the narrative that the outward is what only matters. Instead I now compete with my fellow brothers and sisters in immaterial character attributes such as compassion, truth, forgiveness, justice, mercy and so on. THAT is success. I'm off the depression/anxiety meds now and taking a medication called ""Islam"". Best drug ever, not because it's FREE, but because it's THE Truth. May Allah guide us all."

Same with David Wood or James or any of these other intellectually dishonest folks. U do realize that they almost ALWAYS employ the fallacy of suppressed evidence right? They NEVER include context and often site inauthentic Hadith and Seerah. This is silly.
islam,eylq10x,t1_eylnw8m,1567189619.0,"Especially considering this was all done orally and in one shot. There was no editing process during and after the fact. The prophet didn't recite a verse and say ""No, I change my mind, change these words and order it differently"". One Miracle, in one shot, one verse at a time. Add on top of that the Numerica/Mathematical miracle of balance in the Qur'an and it's mind blowing to say the least."

islam,ewql3hc,t1_ewpmd69,1565669230.0,"Brother, as someone who went down this path before, DO NOT ENGAGE! Trying to refute sites like ""ReligionofPeace"", ""WikiIslam"" and ""AnsweringIslam"" is an Endless battle that will bankrupt you of your time and consume your sanity. They regularly employ the fallacy of supressing evidence (show you only one side of the story and ignore context when it suits them) and use emotional arguments instead of intellectual ones. Time is one of the (if not THE most important thing) a Muslim is given. Spend it wisely. Read and Memorize Qur'an, help the needy like the elderly, orphans, sick and homeless. Take care of your parents, give Dawah and so on and so forth. PLEASE do not engage them. It's good to have the knowledge for yourself but do NOT visit their biased websites. They are as intellectually dishonest as one can get."

schizophrenia,ewcepbm,t3_cnfabv,1565283484.0,"My younger brother is a Muslim Schizophrenic and he doesn't kill people either. Yet after 9/11 in Middle School, he was constantly bullied and called Terrorist.  His Paranoia only became worse after that and now he is pretty much non-functional. As a Minority within a Minority family, we are contemplating moving 2 Canada (Toronto). With white supremacy, weekly mass shootings, expensive healthcare/college and cost of living; America is slowly imploding from the inside. Money will forever be intertwined in politics so the NRA and lax gun control will always be there and American unchecked Capitalism and greed only feed this Monster. America, you had a good run but it's clearly all downhill from here. I don't have any mental illness beaides some Depression and anxiety but please pray for my younger brother my fellow, beautiful brothers and sisters in Humanity! May God ease your symptoms. Salaam Alaikum (Peace be onto you ✌)"
