EDAnonymous,fnwqt6c,t3_g45y3x,1587323633.0,With me it's about control (or lack there of). Because you can't controll the outcome of the argument you compensate that by feeling in control about food. That feeling of control makes you comfortable.

Somehow it really helps and i went from maybe eating breakfast once a week to eating it almost every day now.

Maybe you could decide at home what you want from the deli or bakery and then ask for that. It might help to start there so the mental hurdle of walking up to the stand and ordering it is a little less high. Small steps :)"

apprenticewitches,fnm7tvr,t3_g2l9zf,1587066602.0,"Astrology isn't the biggest part of witchcraft. I only work with the moon phases (i don't know if that is even part of astrology?!).

Religion isn't a part of witchcraft. It's the other way around: witchcraft can (but doesn't have to) be part of a religion. When i started getting interested in witchcraft i wasn't wiccan (now i am). If i thought that a ritual or spell was too religious i would take parts away or make my own.

The witch communities on reddit helped me a long way but most of it was trial and error. The witch of wonderlust on youtube has some great videos about basics (she's not wiccan).

I would suggest that you start with a part of witchcraft that you're interested in (for example if you like baking, look for ways to incorporate witchcraft into your baked goods) or looking at some witchcraft/folklore from your country.

I wish you much knowledge on whichever path you choose! Feel free to message me if you have more questions!"
apprenticewitches,fncs0tp,t3_g0yt24,1586845318.0,"I would suggest starting with the basics such as meditation, circle casting, etc. Once you feel confident with those you'll be more confident with workings with spirits/deities. If you are scared to invite unwanted presences, try to be as specific as possible who you call on to work with.

You don't need crystals or plants to practice. They are a nice part of the craft but not necessary. I make a lot of things myself. For example: i made little clay representations for the God and Goddes(i'm wiccan)  and for the elements. Also dollar stores or second hand stores can sometimes have some nice gems!

apprenticewitches,fn3887q,t3_fz51rm,1586615195.0,"1. You can use those fake candles with batteries in them if you really want to use candles or find substitutes for using a candle (for example instead of having two candles to represent the God and Goddess i use the high priestess and hierophant from my tarot deck).

2. I mainly use pinterest and the witchy subreddits (most of them have wiki's where you can find a lot of information and links) also the witch of wonderlust has some great videos on youtube, a lot of which are focussed on basics and information for new witches.

3. Food/drink offerings go into the bin respectfully since i can't bury them or release them into the wind/water. Things like small stones or decorations that i used as offerings either get a place on my altar or get put into a little storage box for later festivities (for example my imbolc crosses are put away so i can re-use them next imbolc)

EatingDisorders,fn368xl,t3_fz1md9,1586613874.0,"These are a few things that might help:

* just listening when she is comfortable talking about it. Don't try to solve things or find a logical reason. ED's aren't logical most of the time.

* ask her about triggers. Certain foods, topics or maybe places on her body being touched can be really uncomfortable for her.

* ask if she knows things that might help her. For example: i asked a good friend if she can check in with me every once in a while how i'm doing food wise. It helps me to open up about my ED a bit. (Could also be things like agreeing on having a cup of coffee with a biscuit every afternoon or anything else she thinks may help)

I have a cubby in my bookshelf where i keep it with some plants, crystals and tarot cards.

Simply put: An altar is a place to practice your craft. You can make it so it fully fits your life. 

I can take it out of the box and put it out on my desk and that works the best for me. If you want a portable one in a tin or a permanent altar or something else then do that. Everyone's altar will look different."

It isn't severe but it isn't normal. My only advice: talk about it with a professional. Maybe start with talking to someone you trust and you could even ask them to come with you to the appointment if it makes you feel more comfortable."

Than to have them just assume that it's the same thing. It's just more respectfull to witches and wiccans to know the difference. It's just like assuming that someone who meditates is a budhist.
Witch,fhxaxmu,t3_f4wy31,1581949859.0,I think the best thing to do is to just look up a ritual or spell related to something you are interested in (for example if you're really into crystals look up a ritual that uses crystals) or something that applies to your current situation (like a self love ritual if you haven't been the nicest to yourself lately). Most rituals you find you can alter bits and pieces from to make them fit your timeframe or how big of a ritual you are able to do.
Wicca,fhx80of,t3_f57g6a,1581947511.0,"With my family it's the same, so i decided not to tell them. I have my altar inside a little box, my book of shadows is a simple black notebook and i mostly use the internet as a source. I really like learning from books and i bought one recently. It says Wicca really big on the cover so i got some bookpaper (like wrapping paper but a bit more durable) and put it around the cover. My family thinks it's a textbook from school. It took me some time to identify as a wiccan so don't worry about that.

A good place to start is the wiki on this subreddit and in general asking and reading questions on this and other wiccan/pagan/witchcraft subredits. Also feel free to message me (and probably a lot of other redditors) if you have questions or just like to chat about things you're curious about :)"
AskReddit,fhugkef,t3_f4t308,1581886148.0,Not a rumor but there are a lot of kids at the school i go to that genuinly believe that i'm one of the teachers. They'll call me miss when asking something and quickly pretend to be busy with their schoolwork when i pass by them in the cafeteria. It's pretty funny :)

AMA,fhu9xyo,t1_fhsh6ds,1581883847.0,I learn from books (currently reading Wicca a modern practitioner's guide) and I write the things that are important to me in my book of shadows. It's sort of a personal spell/witchcraft book.
witchcraft,fhu812c,t1_fhrohbv,1581883142.0,"I strongly agree with this. A friend of mine is a pretty strict christian and i talked a lot with him about witchcraft/wicca/paganism. He's totaly cool with me doing and believing whatever the fluff i want. We talked a lot about holidays since he celebrates most of the christian holidays (recently while i celebrated imbolc, he celebrated saint brigid's day) he never thought about the fact that his traditions were once traditions of others. I'm glad my friend is really accepting and genuinly interested in some things but i've also had some experience with some a-holes who are just too stupid to even listen to my explanation."

witchcraft,fhu5bqz,t3_f4vbbi,1581882174.0,"I get this a lot, most of the times not even picking the card, it will just jump out of the deck. My tarot cards aren't always serious but most of the time it's just their way of telling: before you go along with your life, fix this."
witchcraft,fhu4hko,t3_f4thc0,1581881919.0,"Haven't had any experiences with spirits yet, but I definitly get called out and made fun of a lot by my tarot cards. Most of the time i get serious answers to my questions but it's like sometimes they feel like they don't want to be serious and i get the weirdest answers to my questions. I recently started asking them how serious they are going to be during the reading. My tarot deck is very much like the memes."
realwitchcraft,fhs0174,t3_f4o34f,1581846993.0,"I believe there are a few witchy books on audible? Not sure since i don't use it, but you could look into that. Or maybe online books? I believe my library has online books that you can change the font of to make it easier to read. Maybe other libraries have that too."

(My grandpa's new hobby is researching the family tree) He also found out at one point a long time ago a woman from our family started a family with a man and after he passed away she started a family with her dead husbands brother, so her kids are nephews/nieces and siblings at the same time."
