AmItheAsshole,fop7ys8,t3_g8mxce,1587955109.0,"NTA. Some women are so insecure about their loser husbands. It isn’t another woman’s fault if your husband finds her attractive. If your husband loves you, he should be able to respect you and your marriage regardless of whether an attractive woman is around. And if he can’t, you need to confront HIM, not the other woman who doesn’t give a shit about your husband and who likely wouldn’t give him the time of day!"
