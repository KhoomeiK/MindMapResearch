I try to never like or retweet or even “interact” with  accounts I don’t know.

If I don’t know an account and I see it breaking TOS I report it, even if I passionately agree with their “point.”.  

I revisit my follows and followers fairly often and  soft block or block accounts that I was wrong about.

If I disagree (important disagreement) with someone whom I respect or who has taught me a lot. I either ask questions privately  or keep my peace.

I am still learning so much from my corner of political twitter. Using notifications I can look at my favorite accounts first and following over 1,000 accounts  I almost never miss important controversies where alternative POVs are available to me. For a process person like me it’s an extremely satisfying passtime. 

I do understand it’s a significantly different experience for the big “influencer” accounts like the one being discussed here. Right or wrong the degree of scrutiny, spam, doxxing she must experience on Twitter boggles my mind. I’d stop posting on my main too, if I faced that on the daily. It’s probably counterproductive for her to do a lot of blocking and there’s no doubt that Twitter sucks at dealing with Magas and Mysoginists. They suspend an account for replying to hate with an f bomb while the hater carries on because they have bot army backup.🤷🏻‍♀️

I’m very much enjoying Reddit now too. The two platforms complement each other beautifully. Reddit at its best tends to offer posts and convos that place high value on evidence and reasoned argument whereas Twitter at its best is what I think of as real-time free speech in with all the emotionality and rhetorical sparring."
GamerGhazi,fd46l31,t1_fcvviud,1578164893.0,"Hi there.   your critique of Twitter is right on. Thank you! 
Just want to share my Twitter story and a current dilemma that’s a consequence of my intentional bubble-building there.
Background: I’m an older woman and so not a particularly likely participant in Twitter and Reddit but thanks to the disaster in 2016 and gaming here I am! I am somewhat radical with regard to ant-racism and particularly interested in pushing hard for intersectional priorities in the Democratic Party

I consciously started to build a Twitter bubble in 2017 because I knew that raw Twitter wasn’t going to do much but traumatize me more. I started to follow and read Black Women who had supported Hillary and  also to unfollow what I  initially thought were required accounts  (Maddow, NYT, The DNC). I also began to readily block many accounts, particularly those that attack Kamala, Hillary and Nancy Pelosi That bubble has served me well over the last two years, right up to the point where, Kamala  dropped out of the race.

The downside to my plan has arisen from the fact that after Kamala dropped out the vast majority of my mutuals(I think of many of them as senseis and/or friends) are Democratic loyalists and so my continued loud  criticism of the Democratic front runners and the “mediocre white man cattle call of 2020  is becoming disrespectful to folks who know that the Democratic Party is the only (non-DSA) game in town for their communities and interest groups. That’s a big part of the reason I’m working on my understanding of Reddit. Well, that and Sekiro lol.

Tl;dr: creating your own  Twitter Bubble can make Twitter much more useful but even that can have drawbacks

PS: I’ve seen it frequently pointed out that for black Twitter, it’s almost unheard of for someone to be truly,permanently cancelled.  R.Kelly is a good example of someone coming Damn close,  as is Omarosa. I’ve also seen it said more than  once  that often negative takes on cancel culture set off a racism alert."
