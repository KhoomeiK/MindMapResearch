He think therapists are a load of crap so I know he wouldn’t go, unfortunately. I agree that he needs it. I’m fairly certain he has depression as well as a personality disorder but whatever. 

Thanks for the advice! I think I’ll use that next time he gets angry."

HaircareScience,fh74u2h,t3_f1dpxz,1581315170.0,"Do you have an Ulta nearby? Try Uberliss Bond Sustainer. It’s over by the hair dye/bleach kits. There’s also a treatment by Redken called PH Bonder and it’s supposed to be very similar to Olaplex. 

Also, Olaplex isn’t a conditioner - it only rebuilds the bonds in your hair. So make sure you have a really good moisturizing hair mask to use to restore moisture. 

Good luck!"

bipolar,erlx8uf,t3_c2dtaq,1560999382.0,"Yes! I’m in the midst of one of my worst depressive episodes ever. 

I don’t feel sad. I feel immensely disappointed in myself. I feel guilty. I feel anxious. I know what I need to do but can’t make myself do it. All of my energy goes towards taking care of my kid. If it weren’t for my husband, I’d probably have to move in with my mom because I can’t fully function. 

People who say, “It’s not that hard to take a shower or do a few chores” have never had depression. It can be the most difficult thing in the world to take a shower or get out of bed. 

This is just one of the reasons it’s so irritating when people casually throw around mental health disorders like everyone has them. There are normal levels of sadness and anxiety and normal personality quirks. You are not OCD because you alphabetized your dvd collection. You are not depressed because your car broke down. You do not have anxiety because you’re late on a deadline for work. 

I really wish there were a way to have others feel what we feel, just for a day or 2."

I’ve been in and out of various shrinks’ offices since then. Pretty much tried every antidepressant. Was just recently told I probably have BP. I’m going in July for formal testing. 

I’ve been dealing with BP symptoms pretty much my entire life. I’m sick of trying tons of different meds. I just want to find something that works.

I took the stimulant today but didn’t really notice anything - bad or good. Maybe the dose is too low, idk. I took methylphenidate along time ago for my adhd but stopped when I was pregnant. It was brand name concerta. This is a different formulation - brand name quillichew. Maybe the different formulations affect me differently. I just want the depression to go away. I’d rather be manic than this."
TwoXChromosomes,eqogd2s,t1_eqnk5tt,1560188214.0,"Agreed. I think men are also groomed to repress the more “female” emotions like sadness and jealousy so it all comes out as frustration and anger. 

I feel like whenever females have emotions, we’re called hysterical or crazy. We’re encouraged to use medication like antidepressants or mood stabilizers- even if they aren’t necessary because we’re having emotions that others deem unnecessary."
TwoXChromosomes,eqjfoa1,t1_eqjb12s,1560104072.0,"It just depends. Some days, he’s fine. Other days, he’s moody as hell. And he’s one of those people - if they’re in a bad mood, EVERYONE knows and it affects everyone around him, even if he doesn’t actively take out his frustration on others. 

I’m different in that I internalize everything. I know it’s not healthy and I’m in therapy. I just don’t like others to feel like crap around me. I’m also blunt and I will tell people when I’m cranky so they know to avoid me lol."

confessions,eqbhx9s,t3_bxv6yp,1559949657.0,"I wish! I have a protection order against my ex husband.  We are allowed to talk over the phone regarding the kids but that’s it. He was getting supervised visits but in October 2018, I was informed by the person who supervises the visits that he was “acting” suspiciously” and they recommended I request I drug test. Our divorce decree states I can request a drug test at anytime and it must be completed in 24 hours. If it comes back negative, I have to pay for it. After that, he disappeared. Stopped paying child support, left his new wife, quit his job. Haven’t heard from him since. 

My current husband gets flack from his ex all the time. It’s not horrible, but it’s annoying. Each year, each parent is allowed 2 weeks vacation with the kids - even if it’s during the other parent’s time. Last year, she got it all confused somehow and came to our place, banging down the doors. We eventually had to call the cops because she wouldn’t leave. And both of them talk badly about each other to the kids. The kids are 15 and 17, so they are more aware than smaller kids but they hate it. I rarely talk about my ex period. I don’t know him anymore and honestly, I rarely think about him enough to talk about him and when I do, I make sure it’s neutral. 

All these women who have responsible and caring exes - you’re LUCKY. You might hate him. He might hate you. But at least he loves your kids and it trying to take care of them."

TrueOffMyChest,ep1urb6,t3_btp98q,1558996575.0,"I am a 34f with a bachelors degree in nursing. I graduated top of my class with honors and I loved my job. I can no longer work as a nurse because I am disabled. I was diagnosed with lupus and fibromyalgia about 5 years after graduation. Symptoms have gotten worse, despite treatment. One big symptom is called “brain fog”.  It’s difficult to think of certain words, even if used regularly. You forget things easily. You’re basically walking through life in a haze and you feel mentally dull. It’s awful. You know you’re not stupid but you feel very stupid. 

Video games have definitely helped me dial back the brain fog. Coming up with strategies and solving puzzles have made me feel sharper. Not to mention hand eye coordination. 

Some people just have to feel superior. There are lots of activities I don’t enjoy and I don’t bitch at people about their choices. 

Honestly, I think most people have minor addictions - like gaming, shopping, art, reading, tanning, etc. As long as you can manage your life around it without going into debt or ruining your life then what’s the big deal?

If you do decide to enter into a relationship, find a partner who enjoys gaming as well. Otherwise, you’ll never hear the end of it."

I live in very baggy sweatpants and oversized T-shirts. I buy my shirts from torrid and they’re extremely soft and comfy. When I leave the house, I swap the sweats for leggings. 

I haven’t worn denim in a really long time. I can’t stand it."
