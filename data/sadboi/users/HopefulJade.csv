TheSilphRoad,fr4a7qn,t1_fr1v0yx,1589881383.0,"If they can't get you to switch Giratina forms or Arceus forms instead of creating separate pokemon they won't make Gengar evolve into Mega Gengar, because in the MSG Mega forms were temporary (would persist through out the battle and when switched but after battle would revert back to normal form). Most likely scenario they will release it as a separate Pokémon. Shaymin, Keldeo, Darmantian, black/white Kyurems also come to mind."
TheSilphRoad,fr49xjq,t1_fr2mpl7,1589881092.0,"Considering Gastly is a nesting species that is often in daily quests and events, it should be easier to get as a shiny. Also considering Gengar shiny was released as event raids, most collectors either have or will eventually complete the family faster than the 3 Weedles that they will need to complete the Weedle family. Imo I think it's smarter to get the Weedle CD when it's high rates and then hunt for Gastly through quests, nests or events."
TheSilphRoad,fr3ug4j,t1_fr37gsa,1589866586.0,Have a balanced team that can cover each other and don't lead with fire in this meta. Switch it in to a grass type like you switch razor leaf users into an Azumaril.
TheSilphRoad,fr3tr4k,t1_fr3673w,1589866030.0,"Compared to something like Weedle that never nests so you have to rely on random spawn encounter in the wild on top of the random chance. It's usually easier to farm a shiny from nests if it can nest because they appear often in one area, especially if it's a nest close to you. Also nests rotate often so have a chance of seeing another nest nearby that Pokémon you were looking for."
AmItheAsshole,fpvklq6,t1_fpvjhs0,1588946679.0,I feel like the whole crashing the wedding to gain closure is a bit too convenient. Even if granny orchestrated all of this she was still the one making choices and could have done a ton things before her interaction with the bride. Either way I just feel bad for the bride that this happened.
AmItheAsshole,fpuxuta,t1_fpuooru,1588927574.0,I think OP could have definitely given that information out at an appropriate time in an appropriate way instead of ruining a day the Bride probably worked hard on to make it special.

BPD,eynv0oo,t3_cxvl98,1567262728.0,I never cared before because ultimately I knew they weren't the kind of person that would date me anyway so why waste my time thinking about it. But after I started dating someone out of my league it was a constant reminder that I won't be good enough or hot enough for them to date me. It blew my mind sometimes when they said they thought I was too attractive for them because I know I am not but that made my anxiety worse.
TheSilphRoad,eyhsq51,t1_eyhni7x,1567092154.0,IMO the biggest problem with the current shiny rate system is that people who grinded the hell out of events and nests for a shiny are coming out empty handed on that specific Pokémon. So I think shiny chaining is the only thing that needs to be implemented for both raids and wild Pokémon to ensure the dedicated players are rewarded for their efforts. I personally believe the rate is fine and a bit high but bad RNG sucks and gives less incentive to keep playing the game.

It hurts soo much when someone you care deeply for, because you have BPD, gives up on you. It isn't fair and life isn't fair when no one sees you as important. But giving up is never the answer. The pain you feel is temporary even if it occurs over and over again. Talking to someone who is willing to listen about your experience will help you to deal with the intense emotions you feel right now. It will help you realise how to change. You aren't alone in this world, that is something you have to constantly remind yourself. A lot of people are in the same shoes as you and they are feeling what you feel. You always meet new people who can change how you perceive the world. They can surprise you by being a new friend or partner. Killing yourself will deny your future self that source of happiness. This is short term and you will bounce back from it"

TheSilphRoad,ercxl7c,t1_ercx0ae,1560724813.0,I'm not disagreeing with you on that thought but there are still a lot of players who buy items to increase there chance and find chasing a fun way to play the game. Niantic just sees it as a way to make money so don't think they will ever change it to make the RNG fair.
TheSilphRoad,ercx14c,t1_ercvzk2,1560724355.0,What because a casual got better RNG than the hardcore player? Niantic definitely needs to improve the way RNG affects players who have put the time in game but RNG is just RNG.
TheSilphRoad,ercwur8,t1_erctlxx,1560724211.0,Chaining should have been the mechanic Niantic could have used to eliminate terrible RNG but I also have a feeling they didn't use that to increase item sales.
