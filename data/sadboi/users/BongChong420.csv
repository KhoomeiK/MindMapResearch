Still does this, as of for 7+ months. The rest of the trips were ‚Äúbad‚Äù were under 30mg. 30mg+ helps me reach the calm state (for me at least).

It has done this at even 110mg, though, but get in the calmest state you can, even if that state of calmest is still really anxious. It‚Äôs at least the calmest you can get. But I‚Äôm not saying psychedelics or even all particular psychedelics will do that. 

Sometimes having a bad trip is just an urge inside of you that you subconsciously and even maybe superconsciously, that you feel you need to face.

But if I have a negative intent, like ‚Äúthis isnt going to work‚Äù or ‚Äúsince this made me anxious before, it‚Äôll make me anxious again‚Äù (which is a huge one, imo), then it can turn out bad, or just quite unpleasant.
