I work at a daycare in Olympia and we still have 50+ kids a day, and the kids shuffle roons throughout the day.. I feel bad for the grandparents i see picking them up every day"

AskVet,fi129yv,t3_f5rezy,1582049205.0,"Sounds like they possibly ingested something toxic to them. Cats are allergic to ALOT of things you may not realize or just random stuff you may leave out that is accessible to them. 
#1 make sure they are hydrated ! Even if that means force feeding them water through a syringe.  
Take them to the vet if you can afford it at all"

CatAdvice,ffzcs1f,t3_et595m,1580372584.0,"YES I've had this happen, and oddly enough I had this same thought earlier of asking Reddit 
So about 4 months ago our 2 year old bombay cat, went from a happy, energetic, playful, kitty that loved to go outside on the patio and eat as much as possible, to a tired, unenthusiastic,  cat that just sits in one spot all day. 
I got used to that after a bit but then about 4 days ago she started throwing up multiple times a day, not eating or drinking,  and chewing up food but then dropping it and not eating it.

Have yet to take her to the vet unfortunately I am completely broke and heartbroken ): so idk what to do"
CatAdvice,ffysfnx,t3_evh9l7,1580353998.0,"Cats have small, VERY sensitive lungs, so any type of smoke can cause them health problems. 
I've only noticed my cats have a bad reaction to cigarette smoke. 
They were unintentionally around a bit of weed smoke and it didnt seem to bother them. 
Better to be safe then have to take them to the vet and smoke in another room or put them somewhere else while you smoke."

Drugs,ffpmpl4,t3_etyhkj,1580098910.0,I agree. But I also know some of my rich friends dont struggle with mental illness (crazy) and they enjoy doing lots of drugs  (mostly coke) on an addict level.  So maybe it's a mix of both? Or they have a mental illness they are good at hiding

Thank you for your post, it helps know I'm not alone feeling this way"
Drugs,ffkf98e,t3_eu21xv,1580021800.0,"Glad to hear your story. Meth has had huge benefits for me as well. I suffer from severe depression and it's been the only thing that has been able to instantly lift me out of deep depressive episodes. just keep it in moderation and it doesnt cause problems if you need it. And of course you gotta stop sometime, it's not a forever fix."
