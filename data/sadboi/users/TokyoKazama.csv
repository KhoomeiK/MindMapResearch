Also the writing is surprisingly good and there are a few good twists and turns along the way. Also the score is great. In particular 'Alex theme'."

*Ring Ring! Ring Ring!*
I slam my arm onto my dresser to grab my phone and the entire dresser shatters into tiny pieces of wood. I still haven't gotten used to this human form yet. I lift my heavy head up from my deep slumber and start sifting through the pieces of debris for my phone still ringing.

I answer it, ""Hello?""
Voice: KAI!!!
Me: Tanya, what's up?
Tanya: Guess who finally came around? The groundskeeper for the old transport museum finally caved in and said we would check the place out after dark!
Me: I thought you wanted me to guess though...üòë
Tanya: You in? üò∂
Me: it's 2 in the morning!
Tanya: Fine I guess I'm going without you!
Me: No, no wait (if I remember correctly that old transport museum in rectory Lane is the old stomping ground for bastille demons. Nasty fuckers, even for me). I'll come along, just let me get dressed. I'll meet you at your place in about a half hour?
Tanya:""KAAAY!!! üòäüòòüòòüòò""
Me: Yep OK... Bye. 

2.29am
I arrived at Tanya's apartment. 
Before I even knocked on the door she opened the door with an excited energy and huge smile dressed in what can only be described as a tomb raider cosplay outfit but with night vision goggles and a backpack. She fills it out nicely though, I must say. I never found human bodies attractive before I met her. Actually I don't think I feel this way about anyone other than this human. 

*Oh my Lucifer, am I just standing here in the doorway thinking to myself whilst she's been talking this entire time? Quickly start paying attention*

Tanya: Background Mumble mumble mumble... So that's why we only have tonight to do it before it gets demolished tomorrow morning by the council! 

Me: Ok. What are we waiting for, right? Let's get going! 

3:03am Transport of Age museum, Rectory Lane.
The uber driver could only take us to the exterior. I say could, I'm pretty sure that's a close as he wanted to go. 

As we both exited the car we noticed the groundskeeper wasn't standing at the front of the gate ready to let us in as he had arranged with Tanya. It was however, left ajar. We walked up the driveway, I could sense something was off. There was just quiet. The ambient temperature a lot cooler than that I'd expect of a bastille stronghold as they are notoriously warm venomed demons. Ateast the ones I've slaughtered anyways. 

Me: Where's this groundskeeper then? 
Tanya: I'm really not sure. This is kinda weird. Maybe he's inside. Look there's a light on inside that room! Let's gooo!!!

I remember feeling pensive and looking deeply at the haunting, decrepit building in front of us. Broken windows, cobwebs, a strange smell and only one dimly lit room in the far corner on the 4th floor of the building. 

It had been 4 years I've settled on Earth and almost half as long since I've had to use ""that"" form. Why do I get a feeling, I'm about to get more than I bargained for? 

And where the shit is this groundskeeper?

You again group people together and have interpreted people's opinions to confirm to whatever personal bias you have on the topic. 

Whilst you're tone is still laced with shaming. I. E. To paraphrase, people who like to 'dress up as babies and watch hentai', I believe we are on the same side about this. We are just presenting our points differently."
TwoXChromosomes,f0j9yfv,t1_f0j77ex,1568653184.0,"You're so fast to generalise or put someone in a particular camp for expressing their opinion on an article.

Your point wasn't lost on me, your tone throughout has been laced with rage, so I fear that whatever I'm saying won't get through whilst you're in this state, but I'll repeat it nonetheless. 

There isn't something wrong with someone if they want to have conventional sex for the rest of their days, there also isn't anything wrong with people who need sticks up their butts to climax. Each to their own. 

All along I've been emphasising the importance of respecting an open mind towards fetishes in relationships. I don't encourage people shaming their partners for not being into a particular fetish just like I believe you shouldn't shame people for possessing a particular fetish. So maybe take a look at your own language, it suggests you are shaming a sub section of society for having 'fetishes', when your argument has been for people not to shame others because of what they are or are not into."

Also, just because its edgy for you or learned about via porn doesn't immediately mean it's inappropriate or bad. That's quite a narrow minded approach to thinking about it. If you want to keep having this ""vanilla sex"" you speak of, then carry on. But those with particular fetishes should carry on living their best lives with people who share a similar mentality towards sex (as long as its ethical to do so)."

WritingPrompts,euwwdxb,t3_chjzok,1564080379.0,"Period Pain and The Gyna Man have been going at it for years. Their feud has destroyed cities, lives have been lost, battles raged on for time.

'Period Pain' has the power to distort time in short bursts. He can send objects back and forth in time and space even as far as into a different era, whilst The Gyna Man has the ability to use kinetic energy to his advantage. He absorbs, vibrates at an astoundingly fast frequency and is able to deflect incoming projectiles.

One fateful evening, PP is assisting Cosmic Tantrum with a bank heist. Just one last score until their Death Ray machine is built. PP hasn't used his abilities since a couple weeks ago when he had that stroke whilst moving the previous Death Ray into the 1990s so that he could make a bunch of money selling it off as futuristic tech.

On this occasion however, it is clear that PP is struggling and he is phasing himself in and out of the bank vault. CT is keeping watch as his henchman slowly phases into the vault to secure the gold. All of a sudden, BANG!!! NOT THIS TIME COSMIC PERIOD MAN!!! BOY!!! PERSON??? What are your names again?

""Jeez, you do this everytime Sergeant Strudel! It's Cosmic Tantrum and this is Period Pain!"" They both look over to see a pair of legs slipping out of a magical dimension in the wall. ""Erm, is he okay?"" Says Sergeant Strudel. 

""Yeah he's fine, why don't you worry about your own sidekick pal! He looks a little worn out!"" They both look at The Gyna man standing in the corner panting loudly phasing in and out.

Sergeant Strudel yells, ""Gadjjamit Gyna, I thought I told you to stay behind! I got this shit!"" 

""Not a chance boss, I have a score to settle. I don't know what Pain did to me last time we met, but my powers haven't worked since...

I need to find out what he's done to me and I don't know what you guys are up to BUT THIS IS GOING TO END RIGHT NOW!!!"" (Powers up and charges at Cosmic Tantrum only to be backhanded straight into the vault which smashes into rubble. Both Cosmic and Strudel are in shock as the vault smashes into bits. 

The dust clears and neither Period Pain nor The Gyna Man can be found.
