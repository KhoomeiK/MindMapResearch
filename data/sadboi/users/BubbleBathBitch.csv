I had to drastically cut calories and work out a ton to really see weight loss.

I'm controlling what I can at this point in time. I'm not eating anywhere near as much sugar or processed foods. I used to have microwave meals at least once a day, oftentimes twice. Fast food several days a week. Its been maybe 2 weeks since I had fast food? Sugar I have here and there but with the metformin I don't crave it like I did. I'm also eating less.

As for the weight fluctuation, I've ""lost"" as much as 14lbs. Sometimes it will go back up to a 4lb loss, back to an 8lb loss, 6lb loss... But I have not gone back to my starting weight or over. 

My next goal is to incorporate a healthy lunch. I've got breakfast figured out for the most part. And to start working out as soon as I get the CPAP sorted (leaks are a big issue right now and Im just now reaching my goal of not waking up in the middle of the night).
