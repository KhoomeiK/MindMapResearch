AmItheAsshole,fqhi6v7,t1_fqhh5m6,1589377501.0,"I'm not saying that you can't diffuse the situation in the classroom or that that isn't a vital skill?? I was using the specifics of the situation and criticizing the expectation that teachers should give that much undivided attention to a single child. Nor should the teacher let a tantrum get to that stage. I was agreeing with the comment above me, not stating that ""hey ho, tough love is the way to go"""
AmItheAsshole,fqhf6t1,t1_fqhd9uc,1589375701.0,"I'm not in the US, I am in a developing country and unfortunately the majority of children in this country are from underprivileged backgrounds. And we're taught that for the kids yeah everything is going to feel big and new and difficult to deal with but as a teacher you're ultimately there to guide them and show them that yes their feelings are valid and sure it'll be soul crushing but you can find a solution and help guide them to that solution. Kids are resilient little tykes and can be distraught one minute and then fine the next. They're not training us to be cold and authoritarian. You can put their needs and their wellbeing first while still teaching them how to navigate their emotions and their feelings without consoling a child exclusively for close to half an hour. The teachers role is to guide them in how to take care of themselves as best they can at that stage. 

Also play is the most effective  way for kids to learn and develop their skills at preschool age, it's not meant to be a formal form of education. It helps them develop healthy and positive attitudes to learning and allows for multifacitied learning and a strong foundation to prepare them for formal education. That there's not a focus on ""the real school stuff"" and that it's all play is a fantastic thing."
AmItheAsshole,fqgwtzs,t1_fqgufrh,1589359893.0,"I'm not saying that one on one time isn't possible, and it's not something I'd shy away from. Where I live, it is very likely that you'll work at an understaffed pre-school/school, and our lecturers have been stressing that while we should know the ideal ratio and that that's how big classes should be, unless we are very lucky we will likely work at a school with 30+ kids in a class with maybe two teachers. In those situations, taking that long to comfort one child not feasible.

AmItheAsshole,fqgmj4i,t1_fqgka3n,1589350383.0,"This is exactly what I was thinking. I'm studying to be a preschool teacher and they've emphasized to us on many occasions that when a child cries you try and diffuse the situation but you can't be distracted from all your other students, you can't just step away from the class for 20 minutes and leave them unsupervised."
