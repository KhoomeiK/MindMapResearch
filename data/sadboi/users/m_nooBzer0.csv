peak a certain time and spend that time with programming. It won't be directly related to coding- some videos, deep research about a topic, your personal projects, notes are okay, not daily of course.

If you are starting in this lockdown: when you are distracted just think about how you'd feel later when you'd realize that you've missed one of the greatest opportunity of learning something in a hardcode way.

IWantToLearn,fml9d6z,t3_fvwxwb,1586181697.0,"**Practice!**

This how I mastered what you call *10 finger typing.* I was famous in my school for typing faster than any other student and teacher. But later I realized I was typing in an incorrect way - with dominantly using the right hand more than the left hand.

I tried to follow the traditional way but it was too complex to understand and my WPM was lesser than my right-dominant way of typing.

I don't know how but I had a software named [Typing Master](https://www.typingmaster.com/) installed in my PC. I started with it. Later, I was just looking some stuff related to typing and found this site, [SpeedTypingTutor](https://www.speedtypingonline.com/typing-test) and I've been following it since then. One of my friends learnt from a website named [typing.com](https://www.typing.com/student/lessons) but I haven't tried this personally.

&#x200B;

Well always remember number one rule of typing: 

# DO NOT LOOK AT THE KEYBOARD."

Remove it from motherboard, connect monitor directly to motherboard and use it for a day or two. If issue continues it must be any other part.
