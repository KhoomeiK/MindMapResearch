You never forget but the memories turn from sorrow to happy as time passes.    Therapy or journaling your thought and feelings helps get them them Out There and sometimes this helps stop you from going over and over and over the grief in your heart.

If the damage is so bad, offer to accept a return and upon review that it is, indeed, the item you sent, say you will initiate an insurance review with the USPS or whomever you shipped with.

Buyer doesn't need to know if you truly bought insurance or not. Then give him his refund and if he chooses to leave neg feedback, accept it and respond with truthful reply.  ""buyer claimed damage, I accepted return"".

Even though it's wonderful to have perfect feedback, NEVER, EVER, get into the situation where you let that % of feedback control how you deal with your buyers.

I learned one thing early and that is not to have TOO MANY RULES. Little ones are not in the Marines, they are children to be guided by example and patience.

Never had much trouble with kids ""running all over me""......they've turned out to be marvelously kind, competent adults and parents.

So I dunno..... More rules = more fights?    Redirection = this is what we May do."

RedditForGrownups,fq2crmn,t3_gghrj5,1589054896.0,"Here's the thing. You can have a fire extinguisher , it's not gonna prevent the fire but you are at least prepared.

You can make a grocery list but there is always gonna be something you forgot.

You might feel cold, she might feel too hot.

Marriage is ALWAYS an accomodation. When you bring a child into the mix it's the  most wonderful joy and gift and treasure but just as owning lots of expensive jewelry is also a burden , having a child is also a responsibility.

I guess I am trying to say, you have MUST LEARN TO GO WITH THE FLOW.  Don't expect, you'll be wrong 50% of the time. Don't blame, you will be the bad guy the other part of the time.

What children need from their parents is 5 good starter years to feel secure, to feel unconditional love, to set their roots deeply grounded into your family soil and after that, my friend, it is off into the big bad world of school and society at large.

YES there will be no sex. YES you will be crabby. YES you will feel as though you must be failing in some way. 

Here's the trick. The kid doesn't know this. They only know Mommy and Daddy love them and they are safe and will always be taken care of.    They don't need a crap ton of toys, they don't need to see every kid-centric production, they just need to be with you, together, a family unit.

It's a lot of adjustment but what portion of life isn't?     Kids are, to My mind, the Major payoff. Money comes and goes. Your looks? eh, we all get old. Your kids are a gift from heaven above."

Even cups and water, depending on your ability to 'roll with it'.

I got a letter from L.B.J   

It said, ""This is your lucky day""

It's time to put your khaki trousers on

Though it may seem very queer

We've got no jobs to give you here

So we are sending you to Vietnam

Lyndon Johnson told the nation

Have no fear of escalation

I am trying everyone to please

Though it isn't really war

We're sending fifty thousand more

To help save Vietnam from the Vietnamese

signed-War is not good for children and other living things."

But my friend, EVERYONE is Not selfish. Many of us care about others. At least to the limits of their ability, they care about family members, neighbors, friends and the elderly and disabled.

I see examples nearly daily without leaving my home. There are people that care but that is what COMMUNITY is.  What you see on TV is bullshit.    

Always, but especially in times of trial, you will see and learn that there are both good folks and self centered pricks.
