TrueCrimeDiscussion,foffzjr,t1_fobsaxi,1587735040.0,"My dad’s best friend was murdered when I was in high school, she was probably one of the sweetest and charismatic people you’d ever meet. The brutality of her death is something I still can’t wrap my head around. The pain you feel when someone you really cared about is killed is indescribable really. There’s a weird sense of helplessness and anger, and quite frankly I can’t really think about her too much (even the good things) because  of the intrusive thoughts about how fucking brutally she died. And how scared she was. This poor woman was tortured in her own home and died in severe agony. Everyone should feel safe at home. People who are that good at their core should not have to suffer that way. 10 years later, my dad, her friends, her daughters are still pretty destroyed. Christmas season is a very solemn and bleak time for us. 

I feel for all of you who have also experienced this... it is truly agonizing. This is why I get so viscerally angry about serial killer fan girls ... they obviously haven’t experienced this horrific shit we have. Fuck Ted Bundy."

I grew up fairly privileged but my parents never taught me about money, ignored me, neglected me. Rather than put me in therapy for severe behaviour and mental issues or get me tutors, they just put me in as many lessons / extra curriculars as possible. I was raped in front of a group of people in grade 9 and was never the same. Received zero emotional support from my parents. I was so proud of myself to graduate from high school with a 74% average after busting my ass, and my dad no showed to the ceremony. The second I graduated, my parents said I had to pay 600/month (with my McDonald’s money) to stay. I fucked off to the big city, got a pretty good tech job, but fucked it up due to unmedicated bipolar. Turned to survival sex work, traumatized the fuck out of myself, attempted suicide multiple times (only once was I visited by my parents). Tried to get back in tech, fucked up again.

That being said, this way of thinking does help me a little bit when it comes to being trans.

AskReddit,f7bjufz,t3_dv0prc,1573570778.0,"If a parent goes to prison, don’t lie about it. My family wanted to protect me/ protect my Dad by not telling me, but it gave me massive daddy issues. During his couple stints, I straight up just thought my dad was ignoring me, or took off and didn’t wanna see me. Turns out he was in prison a few hours away. 

I was a very non-judgemental and well read kid. I knew what prison was. I would’ve understood or wanted to go visit him, maybe send him stuff. Instead, I spent a few years in middle school and high school thinking my dad just didn’t like me or want to speak to me. My dad is literally always reachable. He is the easiest person to get in touch with and always picks up his phone. When he doesn’t, it’s jarring. 

No one ever said a word about where he was other than he “went away” for a bit. When he’d get out, he’d be all fucked up, depressed, look different and be avoidant (I guess out of shame). The added context for why he was acting that way would’ve been really helpful. Not only to understand why he was acting that way, but so I didn’t feel like a bad kid who’s dad could disappear at any moment. 

Now, if I don’t hear back from him within a few hours, I always assume he’s dead in a car wreck (see my other post about his road rage) or back in prison and it gives me the worst fucking anxiety. So yeah, please just be honest with your kids if mommy or daddy’s in prison. Even if it’s something fucked up, it’s better than thinking your parents don’t want you."
AskReddit,f7bii9p,t3_dv0prc,1573569784.0,"Not really harmless, but road rage / wreckless driving in general. My dad would have road rage so bad I’ve seen him get in fist fights with another driver on the side of the road, pull a dude out of his car at a stop light, follow people to their destination to scream at them over their driving. Scream racial slurs - straight up n bombs, ch*nk etc. It always terrified me. When the other drivers pointed out he’s psycho and has a kid in the car he would just get more enraged. 

That, and my parents would always be distracted, get me to hold the wheel, make me change gears for them while they were rolling a joint on the highway. Fucking dangerous shit like that. I don’t know if anyone saw the footage of Jenelle from Teen Moms road rage incident - but holy shit the fear in Jaces eyes, I fucking felt that. So similar to what I went through. 

Both my parents did this thing when they were mad at me in a car. They’d turn up the radio full blast in one motion, clench their teeth and then FLOOR the gas aggressively and speed to scare me and I’d scream at them to slow down. As an adult, I dated a girl who did this once when we got in an argument - she fucking floored the gas violently while we were in a residential area and I broke up with her on the spot. 

My parents have been mocking me for years for not having a car, even tho I’m 27. They could not fathom how I was like the only kid who didn’t rush to get their license at 16. I took the bus or walked everywhere. I’m scared to drive knowing there are people out on the road like my parents.

I get why fans connected with Jax. However, Jax was toxic and Max has a lot of toxic behaviour to work through. Max gave me so much anxiety during the show lol and has been a mess on social media. I might be biased because my ex best friend is a Leo with a drinking problem - he reminds me so much of her. Good god, he is possessive, insufferable, aggressive, insecure, and straight up mean. I often wonder if a woman cast member or moc acted the same way if it would fly and they’d get such unwavering support. But I digress. I can’t stand the guy, he’s my worst nightmare match in the house tbh - I could never date someone who behaves like that. I would feel constantly embarrassed.

People always say, “treat others as you would wanna be treated”, but you should also treat yourself with the same compassion as you would your friends. Thinking this way has helped me be kinder and more patient with myself as I get older. If I tell myself I’m worth it, I’m not my mistakes, I see far more positive results than sitting around and telling myself I’m trash that deserves nothing.

relationships,eykwash,t3_cx9ysz,1567169963.0,"I’m just gonna echo what everyone else is saying, in that this is a really severe psychological problem that unfortunately you can’t fix alone. I’ve seen it first hand, and it seems like a lot of hoarders are extremely resistant to any help. 

Coincidentally, people from both sides of my family have issues with hoarding. Any efforts by us to intervene have caused a shit ton of drama, and every family member (there are 5 people in my family with this condition), across 4 hoarder houses has untreated mental illness. It’s led to many of them isolating themselves because they refuse help and just don’t wanna acknowledge it at all. 

My grandparents are from a third world country and came from poverty, so a lot of their hoarding started by them stockpiling shit for relatives to send them balikbayan boxes (this is a big thing in my culture), but it escalated over the years and got out of hand. No one would ever be opposed to the balikbayan boxes, but eventually it turned into them just consistently buying a shit ton of shit they didn’t need, and cluttering up the house. It also led to a lot of our family overseas demanding more of them, and seriously taking advantage of them. They had so much clothing, electronics, antiques, books, junk, dolls, stuffed animals that they could’ve opened multiple antique stores. 

One winter, my grandparents went to the Philippines like they always do. My aunt and uncle had enough, and they got a moving truck and spent the whole time my grandparents were away purging the house and throwing shit out. A lot of it was junk, but it wasn’t junk to my grandparents. When they got home, all hell broke loose. They both had huge mental breakdowns, there was a lot of screaming and crying. My aunt and uncle genuinely thought they were helping - but my grandparents saw it as a massive betrayal and didn’t speak to either of them for months. They eventually got over it, but it caused tension and resentment in my family for years. 

My father and his uncle on the other hand hoard mostly garbage. As an adult, I briefly moved in with my father, and the small room I was supposed to stay in was filled to the ceiling with broken splintery wood furniture and pieces of wood. The closets were jam packed with stacks of paper. I had to climb and squeeze through all the broken furniture to get to my small mattress in the corner. I constantly thought I was gonna get crushed to death by shit falling on me. It was terrible. I begged him to let me at least move some of the stuff so I could at least find a place to put my backpack, but he refused. I had to sleep with all my belongings at the foot of my bed because there was genuinely no clear space to put anything. His living room where he slept was a disaster. Dust on literally every surface, piles of water bottles, an jars filled with over a decades worth of weed roaches. There was also a pile of mouldy ziplock bags in the corner. 

One day, I thought I would surprise him by helping him clean his place. While he was gone, literally all I did was dust, throw out garbage, organize his computer desk so he had a functional space, sweep the floor. I did not throw out any of his furniture, toys, paperwork (I just organized them by date and put them in neat piles where they were). I was so excited to show him what I had done. 

He had a complete meltdown. Crying (my dad doesn’t ever cry), hyperventilating, freaking out that I threw out his ziplock bags. Saying, “oh sweetie... sweetie you really fucked up my set up” over and over. He had a really terrible panic attack and was inconsolable for hours. He truly could not understand why I could not live like that, and that what he was doing was unhealthy for him. He was completely delusional. It’s hard for me to understand since I am incredibly minimalist and organized. I can’t even go a day without emptying out the trash and in my room, let alone have mountains of trash. What I learned is that what I perceived as garbage and junk, is not garbage and junk to him. Insulting hoarders stuff and calling it that seems to really upset them. 

I guess my point is, there’s sadly nothing really you can do. My dad is bipolar, has severe OCD and intermittent explosive disorder but refuses any treatment or medication. If he doesn’t want to get to the root of his disorder that causes the hoarding, the hoarding isn’t going to stop. Sorry for the essay, this post just really hit home and I’m sorry you have to deal with this. I hope one day they’re open to getting the help they need."

I’d be interested to hear more of your stuff. I’d smoke to this - I ripped my bong while listening to it lol

My main critique is that it could be beefier! I would also mix your vocals a bit differently - I like/get the autotune sound you’re going for, but the vocals are a little dry in the mix, I’d add more reverb or do some more effects processing. It’s good that your vocals are at the forefront of the mix tho. Another thing I’d love for the song is more bass ! I like the sparkly delayed pad in the beat, but it’s not really enough to carry the song.

Awesome job overall, and I’d be interested in remixing it in the future if your producer would ever be down to send ppl the stems! Keep it up.

Edit: just listened to more of your songs, I’m really into Perfect Timing! Dope"

I know it’s not just Britain though, I’ve heard it used by Australians the same way, and my Scottish and Irish family too. No judgement, I’m just not used to hearing it so freely.

relationship_advice,exkv8n9,t1_exkrk49,1566399711.0,"Ummm you don’t have to take a Sexual Education course to know to help a bleeding woman? Many many folks have assisted their abused loved ones without such training. Don’t be so patronizing to assume that anyone without your training doesn’t know basic human decency. This is such a ridiculous comment. No, the husband is not guaranteed to harm OP, but you’re daft if you think keeping a battered woman’s injuries hush hush is acceptable behaviour. I’m concerned that you apparently “educate people to look for red flags” yet you think her husbands behaviour is normal. Hmmm. Ffs, a woman in my neighbourhood who’s a complete STRANGER came running to my stepdad while he was mowing the lawn covered in bruises and bleeding from her forehead. He called the cops and comforted her till they came. But OPs husband can’t do that for his injured SIL? Psssh alright whatever you say."

I am mixed race with a very vocally racist father, and it really messed me up to hear him and his white family talk like that as a kid. It took me forever to dismantle my internalized racism and i still have a lot of weird insecurities from it."
relationship_advice,exihcvg,t3_csw8po,1566328347.0,"What in God’s name is wrong with your husband, and MIL?! Peanut allergies are like the most common one... do they live in frickin lala land? this is so fucking serious. Please OP, don’t leave him alone with her. A few kids in my family have nut / egg allergies... and do you know what we all do? We don’t fucking have anything containing those allergens in the house, and my grandma ALWAYS makes sure my cousins have their epi-pens.

Your MIL is being reckless, and your husband has no backbone. Even my 14 year old cousin is responsible and trustworthy enough to babysit her little cousins with allergies ffs. When I was a teenager, I babysat my cousin with spina bifida and he regularly had seizures. His 13 year old sister and 8 year old brother knew exactly what to do to help their brother, and assisted me the couple times he had seizures while in my care. Children. Complete composed and helpful with their brother. What the hell is your MIL’s excuse? She is being willfully obtuse and ignorant over something that’s life or death. I wouldn’t even trust her not to leave him unattended in the bath, or near a boiling pot of water ffs.

OP, you need to sort this out with your husband. If your MIL cannot understand the severity of the situation, I wouldn’t let her be around him unsupervised until he is at an age where he’s old enough to advocate for himself. Even then, I’d be weary."

The only failure in my life I’m grateful for is failing at suicide. 

My biggest fear is that one day it will get so bad I won’t be able to control myself. I will do everything in my power to make sure I’m not a statistic, and give myself a chance."
relationships,exhhji6,t3_cswp8c,1566305320.0,"I agree with everyone, your wife should really talk to a therapist about this :( what they did was horrible - it’s still extremely fresh, no wonder your wife is still this devastated. Has her family reached out at all? Have they spoken at all? If they have not apologized at all, I would go no contact. 

I remember really vividly as a kid, my aunt got married overseas to her pen pal. Didn’t tell anyone in the family. I’ll never forget the utter devastation my grandma went through. She didn’t get to go to her first borns wedding (sidenote: my grandmother is the sweetest woman ever, who doesn’t have a single mean bone in her body. My mom and all her siblings will attest to her being an amazing mom). My aunt is cool, but honestly a really careless person and didn’t consider my grandmas feelings at all. 

My grandma laid around the house wailing like a banshee, inconsolable for a month. I had never seen her cry in my life, but eventually - time healed it. She just has the worst wedding luck. The night before my OTHER aunts wedding, my aunts MIL attacked my grandma and tried to choke her, unprovoked (because she hates my aunt and is racist), and then during my uncles wedding, she was delirious from being so ill from an untreated UTI, so she didn’t remember any of it. The only wedding she really got to enjoy was my moms. The poor woman deserved none of it. And those kinds of events are so important to her and she’s a joy to have at them. 

I’m not saying it’ll happen for your wife, but with therapy and time hopefully it’ll get better for her. My grandma saw a counsellor through her work. I’m so sorry your shitty in-laws actions over shadowed your special day and hurt your wife so bad :(

Edit: sidenote, my grandma was upset because she said would’ve been willing to fly ALONE to the Philippines just to see my aunt get married. It’s a 23 hour flight, tickets are expensive as fuck, and my grandma worked a very middle class job. Your in-laws couldn’t drive a half an hour? Fuck that. Your wife deserves so so much better. You’re a good partner, I’m glad she has your support."
