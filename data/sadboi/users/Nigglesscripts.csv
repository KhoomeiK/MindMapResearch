Small staggered doses. Eat some fatty food first...Take some Alleve if you have some.  Then take 300mg , set your phone timer for 30 minute and wait. Then take another 300mg with like a bite of PB, set your timer for 30 minutes and wait. Do this until your between 900mg/1200mg

You’ll start feeling small effects here and there around two hours but full blown will hit around 4 hours so be patient. It’s not like a ooiod nigh, it’s beehive different but so fun!

But I gave you some advice anyway. 😊"
gabapentin,fqpped4,t1_fqplta8,1589551454.0,"Oh yeah. Gabapentin is going to be a controlled substance in every state sooner then later. It’s just as bad if not worse then Lyrica. 

I love the Drs that say “oh no Lyrica is the bad stuff! Have you seen the side effects? Heard the withdrawal stories?” Bad stuff but here is a script for 120 800mg Gabapentin. It’s much better for you. 🙄"
gabapentin,fqpotvh,t3_gk8mnt,1589551135.0,"Okay so ignore all the pissy people.

DO NOT INJECT IT!!! People are calling you a idiot because that’s a dumb ass thing to even think of doing. And because your just tossing pills back with no idea what could happen. 

Take a couple days off. Then do this.:    

Eat some fat. Like peanut butter, olive oil, avocado McDonald’s hamburger, (but don’t stiff your self) take some Asprin (NSAID) or Alleve. Then take 300mg of Gabapentin. Set your phone timer for 30 minutes, take 300 more, set your timer for 30 minutes...take another 300,mg do this like 5 or 6 times to get up to 1500/1700mg. You will start to feel a little something around the one hour mark...But it all really doesn’t come over you until about 4 hours in. So patience is needed. Eat a little fat with each dose. Gabapentin has super low bioavailability so the smaller the dose the higher the bioavailability. The fat helps it move along. 

What your feeling now is pretty much the “high”. The feeling mellow, walking drunk...that’s part of it. 

So for me I at first get a little sleepy and that passes. Then I’m just super energized but also super mellow. It’s always better if your up walking around and socializing, although we can’t do that right now with quarantine but you get what I mean. I do A LOT of cleaning lol. It’s just a overall amazing happy mood.

Be safe with it. You have to take a couple days off because tolerance builds fast with this and you end up wasting pills trying to,get high. Like you could have gotten buzzed 2x with your 3000mg dose you tossed back today with only 27% bioavailability. Also...you can’t stop cold turkey if your doing a big long binge. You could have a seizure, true story and withdrawals suck. 

Obviously I’m not a Dr.

That said ....Lyrica and gabapentin mechanism of action are very similar and they are considered related from that stand point. Obviously there are some differences like the onset and duration but to say one is more dangerous then the other in regards to side effects or addiction potential is odd to me. 

Side by side there side effects are very similar, They also  both have the potential for abuse, addiction and horrid withdrawal as we see in here everyday... regardless if it’s being used recreationally or “as prescribed”. People experience awful withdrawals trying to taper off.  It’s just a matter of time before Gabapentin becomes a controlled substance everywhere. 

Anyway I guess my point is it surprises me that your Dr. was all “Lyrica! Gasp, no that’s a controlled substance look at the side effects, but here have some Gabapentin”.lol.

 I thought  he was you” ha ha ha haaaaa. I’d be like WTF!!! Essential with young children there. I’d be calling the police ASAP."
gabagoodness,fqea0lp,t1_fqe9bh6,1589304168.0,How many is “a lot of people”? Like on a average how many people are taking 8000mg a day?
gabagoodness,fqe4rim,t1_fqdsrt4,1589301735.0,Sure! It helps the muscles and nerves. Since Gabapentin messes with our nerves it should help you some. Make sure you have some Imodium handy....

LetsNotMeet,fqdzqxv,t1_fqdov5y,1589299378.0,Exactly.....”I even smiled a little bit”. Comments like that.
LetsNotMeet,fqdzjlj,t1_fqdoj7i,1589299280.0,Well also....they weren’t shears to start with. It was a foot and a half long dagger with three small finger holes like you would have with scissors... Somewhere along  the way the way the foot and a half rusty dagger turned into stainless steal surgical shears.
LetsNotMeet,fqdz6cq,t1_fqdna38,1589299104.0,She threw the foot and a half long dagger looking thing that turned into surgical scissors away when they moved.
LetsNotMeet,fqdyr8p,t1_fqdmbhl,1589298906.0,"Thank You!

The whole thing about the “object” found in the hood was odd. First it was a foot and a half long dagger type thing with three small finger holes....And referred to as singular. Then it became almost plural “Isn’t it funny those “things” were in there all a long”. And “I hadn’t seen those things before”. (I’m not explaining myself well because I haven’t finished my first cup of coffee...lol.)  It was described as a dagger so I could see saying “I’ve never seen that before” but how did the one dagger become plural? Then by a A description over the phone the foot and a half long dagger turns into specialty surgical scissors? 

Also, the  whole refusing to get out of the car for the first guy but when the second guy shows up she pops right out of the car? The overall naïveté of the whole story seems off."

creepyencounters,fqds8ge,t1_fqdru0h,1589295687.0,In the comment I responded to you said you didn’t call them?

Love the downvotes. Those are the people that will wish they were responsibly armed and dangerous when some nut breaks into their house late at night and starts throwing shit at them and then makes themselves at home in their office sitting through bank info...."
creepyencounters,fqdr8oo,t1_fqc5b9c,1589295190.0,Right...and he stopped at the entry way to roll a decorative ball across the floor and throw a container of car wipes at him before calmly going through papers in the office.
creepyencounters,fqdr0e0,t1_fqctp8c,1589295071.0,The weird robber dude was messing with him and was throwing stuff at him.
creepyencounters,fqdqx2f,t1_fqdm8wi,1589295023.0,"Of course there is something they could have done and still can...They could have Gotten all the info from you about the weird encounter.
Told them, what he took...especially the keys. He was in the office so who knows if he got banking info or what not. You also call the police so they have info to put into the system to see if it’s happened before. You call the police so they can ask the neighbor if they had seen or heard anything odd that night. You call the police so perhaps they look after your neighborhood for a while. And he’s it was a break in. Just because the door was unlocked or whatever he broke into your house. Here in the states even using the slightest bit of pressure on a door to open it is considered breaking and entering. And if not that he committed a crime and it has to be reported. I’m shocked you haven’t yet. 

Someone so brazen as to just walk in and mess around with you is totally freaky. And it sounds like his behavior could  escalate in the next encounter at the next house could be worse for so please be responsible and make a report. Maybe even someone security camera saw him.

I’m so glad you all are safe. The freezing up and being in shock is totally normal.and who knows he could have had a knife or gun. The weirdest part to me was how he was messing with you.m"
Bunnies,fqdo3o8,t3_ghr7tt,1589293552.0,Well hello there Thunder! Aren’t you the sassiest fur ball ever. 💜💜💜
gabagoodness,fqcjzly,t1_fqcgxmo,1589260219.0,"Your amazing for kicking the alcohol to the curb!!! WTG!!

So listen.....My mistake in the wording of seizures. I was referring to alcohol & benzos. Those two drugs are most susceptible to kindling and it’s of a bigger concern because of the seizure risk with both. You obviously experienced kindling when you quite drinking for a while and then drank again...How shitty it was once you stopped and started. Again congrats on stopping,

I think you are at zero risk for seizures with your low dose. You’ll be just fine. I do think it’s important that you be upfront with your Dr. in saying “look man this just isn’t cutting it anymore I have researched Lyrica and was wondering if I can switch over to that.” ....hold on I’ll just finish this in our message thread. 😊"
gabagoodness,fqbvgjo,t1_fqblisj,1589244705.0,I’ll try and find the magnesium info. I have some....but also anecdotal accounts from a group I troll in. I pop in to tell them to use it...then they all thank me. It works on the nerves.
gabagoodness,fqbugoz,t1_fqbt8lu,1589244150.0,"I totally get it. One time I typed out briefly the mechanism of action of Gabapentin to someone and how it doesn’t “directly” hit gaba receptors....but didn’t  go into detail and of course some smarty pants comes in with a three page essay in how I’m wrong....🤣

I think your exactly right. When your feeling a little withdrawal and your dose takes your edge off your feeling some thing all right lol. 

I’m so proud for you getting off the stuff. I still enjoy it to much. And I’ve researched the shit out of it for months. How messed up is it to know what I know and still go down the rabbit hole? 🙄🤦🏼‍♀️"
gabagoodness,fqbql8e,t3_ghd46u,1589242011.0,"My point was IF you go CT your at risk for a seizure. It happens all the time. Shit a gal in here did a short binge and I told her to get her hands on some benzos or something because of the seizure risk. I got called a fear monger by another person.....and guess what? She had multiple seizures. You can’t stop a anti-seizure drug CT. 

Your being so flippant about it...”oh I don’t have bad withdrawals”. But your doing Meth to avoid side effects!! You didn’t mention that. And “funny I’ve never had a seizure”. I had specifically said going CT is where you are at the highest risk. Not tapering although your “fast taper”is going to fail you one day at the amounts your taking. 

Man I’m all for recreational drug use but I sure dislike when people are misleading in what they are actually doing. If I hadn’t commented you wouldn’t have clarified and then people are like “cool this person is taking 6400/8000 a day. Runs out two weeks early and just has minor withdrawals and is basically fine”.   But your not fine. You have to do meth to get by. 

“ it’s definitely not a drug you want to be on long term”

Dude you’ve been on it your whole life???

Interesting conversation for sure. Thanks for that. Maybe one of these days I’ll pop 6400mg at once......🙄🤣

Cheers"
