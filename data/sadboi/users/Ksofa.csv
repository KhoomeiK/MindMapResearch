Iâ€™m trying to complete my dex and only need a few more to go! Iâ€™m willing to help trade to evolve or trade pretty much anything (within reason) in return! Iâ€™m trying to complete the living dex so I would prefer to NOT touch trade either of those two! Thanks!

Edited: to remove already completed trades"

college,ey8s1tj,t3_cw4aad,1566927030.0,"I sure hope not, because I spent my first year off at one school, then spent the next 2 years back at home at another, and now I am off at yet ANOTHER school. You gotta do what works for you! No one cares how you do it!"
college,ey6nlph,t3_cvt2xv,1566859783.0,"First off I am so sorry for your loss. 
Second, if you think it would be strange then I just wouldnâ€™t announce that sheâ€™s your mom. Most people will just assume sheâ€™s just going to school as well. Maybe have her bring a pen and notebook if you really want her to blend in? Otherwise the one thing Iâ€™ve learned for sure in college is that everyone has so much of their own stuff to care about what other people are doing."
forensics,ey5zqd7,t1_ey4x45l,1566844086.0,"This was very helpful! Iâ€™ll definitely do my best to cover my bases while Iâ€™m in school, that way I can choose and potentially change what I want to do later down the road. Thanks!"
forensics,ey5zk0t,t1_ey50yt7,1566843971.0,"Looking now at job requirements is a great idea! And the first chance I am able to, I plan on getting as much lab experience as I can! Thank you!"
forensics,ey4m1mg,t1_ey4lrjs,1566797241.0,"Wow thank you so much, I had no idea that all of those courses would help if I wanted to work in DNA. I definitely want to get as much knowledge as I can about multiple aspects in order to give myself options down the road. 

Itâ€™s also helpful to know that there are both specific and non-specific positions. I assumed that they were all very specific so I felt pressured to find a specialty quickly. With the potential general position I can explore a little before officially deciding. Thanks!!"

college,ey3zokq,t3_cvfldi,1566777976.0,"On the first day, Iâ€™ll usually bring a folder (some professors print out syllabi for you), a spiral notebook (thatâ€™s my preferred method of note-taking, if you prefer to type out your notes, then bring your laptop), and then some pens/pencils and a highlighter. 

Once youâ€™ve met with your professors and gone over their syllabi youâ€™ll get a better understanding of any extra materials you may need: note cards, graph paper, sticky notes, etc."

I am in the exact same position right now, spent the last 2 years failing to keep up with classes and kept withdrawing every semester and went through the darkest and longest depressive episode of my life. 

But right now, I am sitting in my new apartment, in a new town, with a new college, and classes start on Monday. Getting to this point was the hardest thing I have ever gone through, but I am excited and determined to get my degree. 

We Can Do This."

Trying to swap between photos, trace paper, and getting a better grasp on the natural anatomy are all really helpful tips, thank you!"
drawing,exwtrl7,t1_exwmaxb,1566624861.0,"Thatâ€™s very true and great advice, I think Iâ€™m going to sleep on it and try again tomorrow. But I love the tracing paper tip, thanks!"
drawing,exwtnbb,t1_exwlj7e,1566624801.0,"I think if I moved the mouth up, it would be too in line with the ears, and usually the nose is somewhere in line with the ears."
learntodraw,exvrta9,t1_exvrist,1566605303.0,"Thank you! The nose was 100% the most difficult part for me. I definitely lost perspective of the angle of it as I drew it. Will definitely work on that next time, thanks for the feedback!"

drawing,exuvjfa,t1_exuuvct,1566588855.0,Thanks! I figured it would be easier to test out shading with different colors vs a single color. But I definitely want to practice shading with single colors
