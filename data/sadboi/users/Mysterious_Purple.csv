Anxiety,fj9ck0f,t3_fbq6n2,1583142177.0,"This seems like a typical day of the week for most of the last 8-9 years. On one hand I do want the company and somebody to talk to in person, but every time I get an invite (not so often anymore), I make up some random excuse not to go.  


I mean, it's been getting better over the last couple of months actually. I started going to Yoga classes once per week with my best friend (yes, [Yoga actually helps with anxiety](https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/yoga-for-anxiety-and-depression)) and I feel way less stressed and anxious once it actually starts. Getting to the Yoga place is still horrible for me. The other thing that is also helping me (been trying it for 2 months now) is [tms therapy for anxiety](https://successtms.com/tms-for-anxiety).  It's only me and the therapist, they place some pads on my head and I sit there for a couple of minutes.   


I've had enough of isolating myself, so 'm doing whatever I can to find a way and solve this. You are stronger than you think!"
