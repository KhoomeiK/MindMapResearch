writers,fj1jru8,t1_fj1cf35,1582921539.0,"It definitely influences the buying decision. Laptops may not be the best example, but let‚Äôs stick with for a moment.

Buyers come with vastly different backgrounds and larger tech purchases can be very intimidating for the majority of people because there is a lot to understand. Say there is a Mac PowerBook and, in terms of core specs, a comparable Dell laptop. 

Both have the same speed processor. Same size display, and are both silver. Hard drive is the same size.

Let‚Äôs say the Dell is 20% cheaper. There are other things that the numbers don‚Äôt tell. How easy is it to get set up and ready to use? How easy is it to maintain and keep free of viruses? What does ‚Äú3.2GHZ quad core processor‚Äù mean?

The product description gives what I call ‚Äúconfidence to click‚Äù. It‚Äôs how a company positions the product head to head with a competitor‚Äôs offering. You can literally A/B test different product descriptions and see the impact on sales for one option over others. 

These descriptions are more important for well-understood markets with a lot of brands competing in the same space‚Äîthink fashion, footwear, outdoor gear and apparel, etc. The more unique the product (or the market solution, whatever shape that takes) the less critical the product description is. When you look at running shoes, for example, it‚Äôs a packed crowd begging for the consumer‚Äôs attention. That means brand voice matters, how a brand regards its consumers, and specs matter less for the vast majority. In that case, I don‚Äôt want to only rely on specs, I want to troll for that emotional connection."
writers,fj1bci8,t3_faye7s,1582916517.0,"Great question. First, it is worth differentiating ""description"" and ""specifications"". Large e-commerce companies often test several versions of a product description to compare metrics and track the paths online buyers take to ultimately result in a sale (conversion). The product description allows the company to talk about the product in context--for instance, a consumer laptop product description might use words like sophisticated, powerful, lightweight, and/or fast. These words make a qualitative claim, rather than a quantitative claim like product specifications make.

Ultimately, the product description helps with search rankings, advertising placements (contextual ads) and conversion. It's a pretty cool and challenging line of work because you get to experiment with language in a constrained environment and get real world feedback about what's working and what's not."
