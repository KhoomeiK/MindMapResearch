Start slow and get a feel for it. The whole point of a pump track is you can ride it slow up to fast but you are riding the track like waves in an ocean, its supposed to feel flowy even at speed. 

Jumps only tend to happen when you get confident at speed as on pump tracks the rollers are the jumps. You can start by jumping into the berms.

The other pointer i have is pump tracks are a full body workout. You will be tired at first but if you can hit it every day you will get stronger and stronger. I went from being knackered after one slow lap to being able ot fly round mine and pump back to teh finish several times fast before i need a rest.

If you stick to one bike no, you will progress the same as if you were on a 20 inch bike that fit you. The extra length at first make sthings more difficult but you end up getting stornger and adjusting.

I have found NOW when i try to ride my daugters 20 inch BMX i overpull bars when i hop and loop out from a bunny hop or over rotate on 180's very easily.

I'm no longer used to a 20 inch bike. Indeed learnign manuals on teh 24 i have found the easiest as the 20 i over pull up and the 29 i honestly can't pull up at all!

For me the 24 is that sweet spot. Bare in mind before i restarted BMX last year i rode 20 inch BMX on and off since 15 so have basically had to relearn everything i learnt (not much to be honest haha!) again.

Bike size is really down to personaly preference. I can't see myself going back to a 20 inch bike now. I find my 24 is perfect and intend to use it for BMX tracks and ramps and parks. I use my 29 for when i really want to go damned fast and bomb hills properly.

HOWever there is ONE thing i have noticed that the bigger teh wheel the easier it gets.

Fakies.

I have learned fakies on a pro scooter, 16 inch scooter, 24 inch, 26 inch and 29 inch BMX and the 29 inch BMX is easier to fakie AND easier to revert out of. Thsi is due to the large wheels offering stability and not turning the cranks so fast."

if you want to do ramps skateparks pump tracks bmx track and light mountain bike trails you can get a BMX. I fyou want to do more orietated MTB trails and pump tracks and bmx track then you can look at 24 inch to 29 inch bmx bikes OR Dirt jump bikes which are like the MTB equivalent of a BMX.

For distance a 29 inch BMX with ramp tires will serve just as well as a MTb especially roads as despite having one gear the gearing is fine for climbing going a steady and for long periods and you can pop the seat high for distance riding. Apart from lacking gears a big wheeled BMX is a much better distance riding bike than a MTb if you plan on only going on roads or canal paths and light trails.

The MTB however comes into it own when you are mostly off road any distance.

Other upsides of the BMX is that for a decent one you are look at less than £800. For a decent MTb you are looking at £1000 unless you go jump bike route in which case you can find them at £700.

If you are just ridng around your estate, no jumping, no trails no skateparks just distance, a 26 inch BMX is probably better as it will be cheaper have fast gearing, no squish to bounce and slow you down and despite lacking gears you will be able to hit MTB speeds on the roads easily with practice, at any distance..."
bicycling,fqo0z0a,t3_gj9tnh,1589505344.0,"The cure for hill fatigue is to get  a scooter and ride one of those up any hill.

Once you ride it all the way up, and i dont' mean walk up, you kick every single meter up that hill on the scooter. Then get on your bike and you will never be bothered by that hill ever again. Thats how you really cure hill fatigue haha.

Source, I can fly up hills on a scooter now hehehe."

Just have em sat behind the flats of your drop handles, whne you get stuff like this, flip em out, lock em in place and boom, you have wider bars for more offroad control. EDIT I forgot about the brakes... ah well.

That along with some slighly nobby tires on this would likely be fine for most easy trails and paths  on a bike like this."

I ride a BMX. 98% of riding ANY size BMX including my 29 inch Jump Beast is done stood up. 2% is when you find a long downhill and wanna look like a boss."

bicycling,fqnyhmq,t3_gjv4z7,1589503919.0,"All i have experience with is BMX bikes. Stolen make  a 29 inch wheeled BMX which is great on and off road, very quick and easy to ride but lacks gears so you are stuck 25/9 But thats pretty quick on a 29 inch wheel bike.

My first ride on it was 13 miles along country roads and canal paths up and down hills. Now teh reason i mention it is becuase when you rais a seat on a BMX geometry bike you end up sitting in a very comfortable upright position much like on  aladies bike rathe rthan the arse in air racer position of a road. Thsi makes it a very fast very relaxed weay of riding and due to the huge tire you can bump off curbs to get air. (I use the local speedbumpos wher ei live as tiny box jumps, teh MAx is so easy to jump).

But  I'm used ot been in a single gear so for me gearing just isn't needed for climbing or distance riding so you might want to look at 29 inch or 27 inch wheeled hybrids that have gearing if you wanna have that play, hopefully somebody will be along with recomedations.

Another option is to just swap your MTB tires to smooth bmx style ramp tires (you can get em in 26 to 29 inch) which are perfect for road riding due to less rolling resistance but still beefy enough for cnaal paths and light trails. Then lcok out your front suspension for a firmer ride."

I watched all 6 films recently then finished with teh sequel trilogy.

GODS is the prequel trilogy terrible haha. Hell the original trilogy oh boy the space scene now are proper shite. Like really bad, really dire. Return of Jedi does ok, but the other two are borderline Fash Gordon quality."

Its ok if a failure is technically retconned in later, it doesn't change what you felt when you first saw it."

Sometimes no matter how much you do, none of it actually matters and some other fucker comes in to sort out the mess you left.

 Films almost never do this because folk like a nice clean ending. If anything the fact this ruins childhood should make you wanna see Palps get smashed even more cos fuckers still around and needs punishing."
