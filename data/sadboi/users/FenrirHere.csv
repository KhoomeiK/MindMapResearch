Or are you not willing begin anew in the path of looking for someone that will most definitely not make the same kind of mistake your husband has. Not everyone cheats. If you want to look for someone that is flawed, but their flaws do not include cheating, having communication issues, or having difficulties being loyal, you can do that. Those people exist. finding someone like that may or may not be arduous, but I wouldn't excuse someone's poor behaviors just because flaws are to be expected from someone."
