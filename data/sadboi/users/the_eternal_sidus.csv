Oddly they originally offered her the house due to not wanting to renovate. But she can't afford to pay upkeep and taxes on it nor could i access it in my wheelchair. So she just wanted time to go through and pack up her stuff. 

They originally told her the will or estate states the house cannot be sold for 18months. Now they claim the lawyer says it has to be ASAP?

I'm relieved to know they can't just trash her stuff. I will make sure she takes appropriate steps if they try to in the next few weeks. This is in Nevada and I thought the law was 30 days notice. But I'm not sure where to look as it's a new situation to me, rather than just being a renter."

Often it's just about using you until you do not fit their needs or a better option comes along. 

The reason I'm mentioning this is because going through a narcissistic abusive relationship is very damaging in specific ways. You've been through a really rough trauma. There's a lot of unlearning you need to do. Like you can feel safe and relax now, but your still programmed for his needs. So, I recommend learning about narcissism and psychopathy and the ways they can be abusive. 

Reddit has a few support groups like r/narcissisticabuse which have been hard to go through sometimes, since it brings back all the memories. But it's been nice knowing I'm not alone.

These may have resources more specific to your needs, but they often lack funding so their assistance may be limited.

IQ is not the only definition of intelligence. There are many people I’ve known with very high IQ, yet they’re incapable of taking care of themselves or they have great struggles with socializing and relationships. There are many people with higher IQ who just also don’t care about life and gave up.  I see it as some people learn and function differently. That doesn’t devalue you as a person. You are so worthy of meaningful relationships and a fulfilling life. It may take extra work, which sucks, but you can do it!

TrueOffMyChest,fhyn5mu,t3_f5gx5h,1581979402.0,"As a woman in her mid 30s this is the biggest source of mental anguish. I grew up on a small conservative town. A place where purity rings are given to teens and they only talk abstinence. I lost my virginity around 18 because I wanted say over my body. I don’t regret it. And I did not marry that guy, thankfully.

I may have had a few times I'm not proud of my choices but I put in my heart that it has nothing to do with my worth. You do not lose value after your husband taking your virginity. The female body does not get ""used up"" in fact being active can help improve muscle tone and strength to make it more pleasurable for everyone.

There’s a lot of misogyny that goes into the purity culture and there’s a point you have to see it as all humanity. It’s not anything from God in my opinion. I think there’s far better things for god to be angry at us about lol. In my heart I know I’m not failing anyone. I know I’m just human, doing a human thing. 

Your value is not dependent on how many men you’ve been with. You don’t owe your husband your virginity either. It’s yours. It’s not God’s or your parent’s. And that is why they go after this because it’s a way to really beat women down. But that power is still yours, you can choose to recognize the damage the purity culture has done to you... then let it go. 

Your worth as a person, as you are right now, is priceless. YOU are what you give your future husband and that is an amazing and beautiful gift. You are a whole, beautiful, and wonderful woman. Do not let anyone make you feel otherwise!"

I don't judge anyone on their struggles though. Sometimes the storm going on inside is far worse than any illness that can be seen. We're all just trying to struggle through our own problems. None of us have a place in judging what makes suffering legitimate or not. 

Though it's nice when your pain can be acknowledged and for that, I hope you know your pain is valid. It would be nice if people could see pain sometimes. Like a we'd all turn a certain color that everyone knows is suffering and reacts compassionately to.

I think a lot of people feel this way though. It’s just hard to talk about because if you say you wanna die then you have these images of straight jackets and being sent off to a hospital. But you don’t want to do it so you feel like oh don’t bother anyone with it.. just keep it all pent up inside.

It’s hard to see that but you need to just give life a chance. Sometimes it’s nice to have that control but you lose all control if you’re dead.

Everyone acts like oh your youth will be the best time of your life and for some that’s not true. Being able to get past school and move into adulthood, things were so much better. Is it perfect? No, but a lot of my issues are due to a chronic illness that came on in my twenties. Still there are aspects better than being a teenager.

Don't judge yourself too harshly with how you mourn what you lost. If you're happy about it, enjoy it. If you're hurt, that's ok. The feeling will pass."

TooAfraidToAsk,f9wb3ws,t1_f9w76go,1575689865.0,"There's definitely a power or talent of influence that comes with psychopathy. They are capable of being very charming, even able to play on your sympathy if it gets what they want. To watch the mask be removed, once they realize you have no use to them, it's crazy but honestly very interesting. I've only had this happen once with a psychopath I knew for many years, but only recently found out about the depth of his metal illness. The term mask is so fitting. It’s just this totally different person appears and you can see where they just morphed into whatever would get their desired result (money, control, punishments or pain they feel entitled to inflict, etc.)

I think it boils down to charisma (though it be dark) and confidence, as well as being able to find those that are more... vulnerable. There seems to be keen sense of who they can charm and who will see through their many masks. It seems more often those who follow or get entangled with a psychopath somehow, are struggling, outcasts, abused, or ill themselves. Which I think is wild because they know empathy and can even mimic it, but never feel it. 

So, positions of power really draw in the psychopath."
TooAfraidToAsk,f9w6cf3,t3_e78l1v,1575687725.0,"I'm pretty sure you can just look back to crazy people in power. Like Vlad the Impaler, probably a psychopath. He still stood out even though it was a pretty brutal time in history. Kinda kill or be killed type of era, especially if you held a place of power, but he was notably cruel. He enjoyed pain and pretty much made that his identity. I mean that's psychopathic behavior to me. 

Look for societies/ruler's that were noted as being especially cruel and that's likely historical psychopathy. I mean ancient people liked human sacrifices, that's probably not mentally healthy peeps. 

I think it's just more of a matter of if there's extensive records on it. However, I feel that if you skimmed through it you'd find it interesting and  might be closer to what you're looking for.

depression,f9vxqay,t3_e77lle,1575682594.0,"I think you need to stop comparing yourself to others. You say you watch others enjoy their friends but I want to know what do you enjoy? What energies you? That is what you should pour yourself into while you are young.

I'm in my thirties and went from a very introverted and shy/socially awkward person to extremely outgoing and capable of striking up a conservation with pretty much anyone. The biggest thing that helped was hearing those negative thoughts in my head and just realizing it was just that, passing thoughts. Then I'd take a big breath and force myself into doing things that made me scared (but nothing dangerous). I was terrified of speaking in front of even a small class,  so I joined an acting thing where you dress up as historical characters and do a presentation in character. I was terrified through the whole thing, but I did it. This doesn't mean you have to go do this, but be open to different experiences. They are some of my favorite memories and part of what really helped me feel more comfortable in my own skin. 

Oh and I have to echo what others have said, it's most valuable to learn to enjoy your own company too. That has made me more capable of handling new social events with less anxiety."

I think it’s a bit entitled for anyone to expect someone else’s property at their demand.  You even gave prior notice of what you’d need to do to give a her a laptop! Maybe I’m just a broke asshole but I think it’s really awesome you’d give away a laptop, period. Asking to move your files is totally reasonable. Also, it’s lame that they both ganged up on you."

Figure out if you even like holiday music. And find the things you do like about the holidays.

It's normal for the body to basically be paralyzed while sleeping, for some of us we just regain awareness before we regain our body from sleep. It is unsettling, especially paired with a nightmare.

depression,ezh4rsy,t3_d13x5q,1567905551.0,"I highly recommend doing some kind of volunteer work. I know we're all very busy. But find a cause you're either interested in or care about and find a way to actively participate. Spending some time walking rescue dogs or helping the less fortunate can help you get a whole new perspective. It can also help you be around motivated and generous people, which could be a good addition to your friend circle. Great books to read are Big Magic by Elizabeth Gilbert, Unf*ck yourself by Gary John Bishop, and you might find Molecules of Emotion by Candace B. Perth really interesting."

In my early twenties I saw a huge improvement in my reaction to cats, but I had no idea why. Also, something about being allergic to them makes you irresistible to cats."

AmItheAsshole,eysbkvr,t3_cyj00g,1567392861.0,"NAH but... I think you need to do some reflection on whether you want to be dating a man with a child. It's totally fair for you not want to be her only entertainment/babysitter, yet there needs to be better communication to your bf about why and what you need from him. Honestly, it sounds like just in general you may not want to deal with a kid, which is totally fair! 

It also sounds like you are the only adult giving her one-on-one attention, which is really kinda sad. It's not your child though, so that isn't your responsibility. Yet is it really fair, to anyone, if you're going to keep avoiding her? 

It is just one of those annoying adult situations where you need to either leave the situation, as you don't want to raise a kid. Or you accept there will be some stress (kids just naturally know how to trigger anxiety) but there's also a lot of love. Try to make a compromise with her that you all (including dad!!!) will play one game and then she needs to play on her own. Also, find something you really like doing that she can do too. Is there an old hobby you could try with her? A video/board gave/craft that helps you relax? Hell, set up a spa in the living room and make dad bring you both snacks! Just finding something you enjoy doing and include her it will make it much easier. Sometimes there's only so much kid stuff you can take, so get creative. 

If she fights you on stuff, you don't do something together next time. She values your time and attention but kids don't always get the value of your time for other things. You have to help her understand that it's your weekend too but since you love her you will spend some time together."
