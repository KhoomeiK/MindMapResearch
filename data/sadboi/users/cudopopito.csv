The only thing that bothers me is the difference between missionary church and the Church of Jesus christ if latter day saints, I mean my mission was horrible, felt horrible 24 7, I had a sever case if anxiety and depression and I didnt even know, these guys need emotional support, no guilt trips, passive aggressive mechanisms to do more, I was 19 at the time but Have growned to be a really bold and arrogant man with a really strong opinion, I never talk about the chruch with anyone and people are free to dk whatever they want to do, thats doctrine, so no need to be racist, homophobic douchbags etc.
So just to put it in perspective 12k is nothing compared to the emotional damage I had in those 2 years, i hate my mission president, he was an overly agressive brazilian business man, not a role model at all.
