Told me that I expected too much out of them, or didn‚Äôt appreciate them because I told them how I was really feeling. They pushed me hard to open up and when I finally did they abandoned me. But I can‚Äôt help but feel like it‚Äôs wrong of to be mad at them for anything even this, leaving me feeling the most extreme loneliness I ever have.

I have some friends who I go to for help but I treat them so badly because I have trust issues and I say sorry every time and I certainly am sorry but I always seem to mess up again and I constantly feel like a burden to them, that they don‚Äôt want around. My mind comes up with these thoughts that they are always talking bad about me and doing stuff without me and i hate that I think that way about them. I feel like I‚Äôm broken, like I‚Äôll never fit in with a friend group, like I‚Äôll never experience beautiful relationships that other people do.
