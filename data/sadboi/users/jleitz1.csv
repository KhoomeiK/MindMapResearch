I have reached out just to ask how he was, and got a very short response back. I want to tell him how I feel but I don’t want to hurt him more than I already have. It’s selfish of me when I’m so confused on what I want.

He has a new girl already. It hurts me more than I thought it would."
BreakUps,fjkjhyn,t1_fjk8xay,1583428030.0,I know you’re right. It’s selfish of me to feel this way. I guess I’m just looking for ways to get through it. We ended things on a good note at least.
Pets,ev8g3zo,t1_ev836vd,1564278552.0,Yes the vet did and nothing came from it. She said it it is most likely behavioral. And there have been no major changes that I think would cause anything. We do have two litter boxes. I’m trying out some new litter but i’m scared that I won’t be able to do anything to help my cat. Thanks for the response.
