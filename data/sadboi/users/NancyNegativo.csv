I tell my son when I’m sorry, when I’ve made a mistake and these nparents things are build in, it’s hard to say ‘but I’m sorry’ or when I’ve made a mistake and I do and I always feel weaker for it and I sympathise with my nparent because when you’ve been conditioned for a certain activity it’s hard to say I’m sorry or you’ve made a mistake but I try to make that a daily activity because being a parent is hard and it won’t always be right and it will always make your child a better person when you admit your wrongs.
