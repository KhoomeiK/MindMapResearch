nocontact,fp2znjs,t3_gb05d9,1588270581.0," If she broke up with you I‚Äôd give it atleast another week. Since your relationship was so short I honestly don‚Äôt think you need the full 30 days. She probably just starting to miss you, and you contacting her rn will throw that off. Though it also depends on how you broke up, if it was a bad breakup you probably need the full 30 days. 

BUT don‚Äôt contact her until you‚Äôre okay with the fact you two may never get back together. You also need to realize that there‚Äôs plenty of other people out there you could date before you contact her. You don‚Äôt want any sense of neediness when you‚Äôre trying to get an ex back because it‚Äôll just push them away more. 

Also if you still have her on social media, it may be a good idea to start posting happy,uplifting things. To show her you have changed. If you don‚Äôt have her on social media you‚Äôll have to make this clear when you do contact her

I hope my advice helps a  little bit! ‚ù§Ô∏è"

~ you‚Äôre going to feel a lot more calmer about your manifestation.

~ the universe is throwing tests at you, to make sure it‚Äôs something you really want.

~ you might see angel numbers (1111, 2222, etc) everywhere.

~you might start to notice it more. For me I‚Äôm trying to manifest a SP, and I‚Äôve been dreaming of him a bunch, and yesterday I even saw four of his friends (not all at the same time) 

~you might over hear people talking about what you‚Äôre trying to manifest.

~d√©j√† vu.

Really, I kind of have this theory that as long as you even take a small sign as a sign of it happening, it going to happen. Since you‚Äôll feel more at ease with the idea, and also start to believe it a bit more. Though idk :)

Hope this helped!"
