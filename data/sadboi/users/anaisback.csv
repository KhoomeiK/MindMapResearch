BPDrecovery,fkpsof1,t3_fjs9hj,1584418272.0,"I do struggle with noth bpd's lol not funny actually. yesterday was the first binge free day...

yes read the first post SUPER IMPORTANT to understand t also understand the physical manifestation of loneliness. you are trying to fill the void in general as we crave something more and are prone to ""boredome"" or feeling empty. hence you try t fill it up with drugs, sex, self harm, food, etc. however recognizing this is a part of the unproductive and unhealthy pattern is the first step. 

second is replacing unhealthy pattern with a healthy one. I started to study and then writing in my journal. I will also starting doing those little youtube workouts. my biggest advice is when you feel manic or super emotional u know what I mean with all that energy switch on some banger (something up beat) and dance ur life away. u would be surprised how winded u r after 30 mins which actually is like 10 songs. :) hope that helps, dear"

I am still sitting here and crying or having flashbacks or panic attacks just cause he grew so much.. into me if it makes sense. *TRIGGER WARNING* i tried t yeet myself off the roof as well but my mom found me before that could happen. it really does feel like my life ended.

BPD,ffqy707,t3_eupsvj,1580146304.0,I wish I could say I felt that but that would imply me feeling anything for anyone other than my fp...khem...I only lived for my fp for a year now. now that he is gone. I have nothing for myself. life is pretty much over

I actually cant imagine how I will react if they do get together like omg. I feel the same like they r so nice t be around, so funny, so cute...and somehow they go for some Dora the explorer looking bitch that tries t have a disorder for a personality. I talk t her too here and there and one of her PSYCHOLOGY MAJOR friends told her that she might have a bpd which like...ik she doesn't let's be straight like she can be depressed ofc anything is valid but what she doesn't have is bpd and istg God sent her to piss me off"

BPD,f4updtl,t3_dlrj88,1571822529.0,"Dude I can't I am at exactly the same situation. Like fr. And he is so emotionally unavailable and he is sorry for that but it feels most of the time like I'm talking to a wall and he has so many other people that r more important than me. When we don't talk, I feel suicidal and worthless. So yesterday was honestly so bad. I turned off notifications (so I don't feel tempted to text them) and gonna give him and all the other people in my life a break from me. I feel like a burden 24/7"
BPD,ere5lzn,t1_ere3cby,1560774390.0,"Like having one of the episodes where I get upset, angry, or extremely lonely. Cuz I just shut down and if they see me at my worst I'm scared they will leave me"
BPD,ere2z0b,t3_c1k33x,1560771465.0,I haven't related to anything like that in a long time. Also I abandon them first out of fear of bursting out in front of them. Just recently I had an episode in front of some of my friends and I'm sure they fucking hate me now.
