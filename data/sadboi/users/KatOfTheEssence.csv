olivegarden,fbf16xr,t3_dh4ksp,1576798920.0,"Judging from your post history and this one, you're short-tempered, immature and you can't handle simple tasks or conversations. You are an entitled asshole. All you do is whine because you can't get your way.

Either suck it up and move to a job that's not in the restaurant business or see a therapist. The restaurant business is high stress, fast paced and demanding. No matter where you go, there will be shitty managers, customers and coworkers. Some of the jobs will make you go home not knowing why you even bother at all. So that's either a sign for a career change or to push on and keep going.

You can't change the world so change your attitude. If you need meds or therapy, then do that. Nobody is gonna hold your hand and take responsibility for you. If you sink, that's on you.

Your whole post history reminds me of why I don't want kids because you act like one."

AmItheAsshole,f6hott5,t3_drahaq,1572859629.0,"YTA. Seriously, you put your neighbors in danger over something you were afraid of happening to you. What made you think ""I don't want them to rob my house so I'll pretend I live next door. Just so long as they don't go to my house"". You could go to the nearest gas station, park, etc. to get a ride if you're so paranoid. This shouldn't even be a question to you. 

You are the reason they got robbed because you used their location with the belief the driver would rob the house you came from. Stupid and selfish. 

What if they had been home? They could have been murdered, injured, traumatized. And just when you think you couldn't be more of an asshole, you lied to them and said ""that sucks""."

It's funny how you crack down on this guy for ""bossing"" then turn around and use your superior rank to do the same and blackmail him. Bossing isn't even a criminal offence. It's abuse of power and will get you fired at most.
