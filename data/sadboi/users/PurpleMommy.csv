breakingmom,fpgvsv3,t3_gdbafh,1588610406.0,"Wow girl!!! That sounds literally awful. Total emotional abuse rollercoaster topped with major gaslighting.
I’m so sorry you went through that, but I believe you will come through stronger and wiser. It sounds like you dodged an asshat from hell. I wish you the best."

I went and got vitamins and have decided to completely change my diet. I’m going to eliminate processed foods totally. I’m just so sad mine is noticeable and will probably need to use eyeshadow.
breakingmom,fonfioq,t1_fon7swv,1587918506.0,"I don’t think it’s an over reaction. I will be honest I am in the south of the U.S. and we have guns down here, and that’s a big no no. Probably unpopular opinion, but who knows who they are and what they are there for. I gladly would have threatened them in my own home."

stripper,fm5lyep,t1_flz4f1q,1585775438.0,"No is a full sentence and that should be respected, if you change your mind that’s OKAY. Don’t let anyone pressure you, if you do you might end up resenting him more. So just express your concerns if he throws a fit, then it sounds like a bigger issue that needs to be addressed."
stripper,fm5kw5r,t1_fm46qpj,1585774846.0,"I would do this too.. or waitress. Don’t risk it, especially being young you don’t want to get into legal trouble and have it follow you your whole life. I started dancing at 18 and never had problems getting hired."

The house fees ect, never have bothered me it is what it is and they are going anywhere. But I have seen some dancers win lawsuits."

stripper,fl9sjgu,t1_fl9491s,1584968044.0,Maybe find a corset that holds them up evenly until you can afford one? It can be one of the bra corsets too so you can still show off your waist!
stripper,fl0rfae,t3_flo75n,1584714073.0,You look great! Something that helps with climbing is using the pressure of your forearm while you pull up.

stripper,fki67kh,t3_figfr0,1584212716.0,Plan times accordingly but sounds like he’s getting too comfortable. I just recently lost a reg and it sucks but the girls here explained it just happens.

stripper,fk6zrku,t1_fk6e53m,1583922995.0,Well I wish you the best of luck! Maybe say something like you’ve been working for a church or non profit.
stripper,fk6zlxs,t1_fk5xn23,1583922829.0,Agreed I use textnow on customers so my real info is protected. But a seasoned dancer would know that you would be a good regular.
stripper,fk5v16e,t1_fk5pkfq,1583888403.0,"I don’t agree with her, you’re entitled to drink at the strip club and wait for your type!
I think it’s kind of typical but people come in for all types of reasons. It’s okay to tip, and it’s okay to say no thank you. Just be kind :). You’ll get all kinds of responses from dancers but you don’t have to go to a regular bar to drink. What regular bar has titties everywhere!?"
stripper,fk5ut4v,t1_fk5pt0n,1583888284.0,"Yeah get their number. It’s apart of our job to be told no and I’m not interested. It’s how we handle the rejection, bc we won’t be everyone’s type. Just simply saying you’re beautiful, but I am looking for such and such, maybe if you find her for me I’ll throw you a tip!

Or just say “I’m good”. But if it’s me I want to see why “you’re good” and how I can make you better!

Find a girl you like try to get her info and become a reg! 3-500 dollars sounds like a good regular to me!!"
stripper,fk3pnj5,t3_fgbadi,1583842747.0,Yesss! Love your ass. Get it girl.
stripper,fk3pl0k,t1_fk36578,1583842685.0,"I’m definitely having a hard time balancing the two. I love my full time job but it can get mundane and dancing gives me excitement and the things I can’t really buy or save for with my full time job.

Do you work full time and dance?"
stripper,fk2puv7,t1_fk1jy4y,1583806403.0,It’s rough full time work dance on weekends but the extra income is nice. I try to save it.
stripper,fjfdyxw,t1_fjeno73,1583289818.0,Yepppp I was like I’ve never been blocked 💀. Except for my ex lmao
stripper,fjemz8l,t1_fjczc29,1583274660.0,The funny thing is is I did like him. He’s actually a really cool guy and I’ve asked him to get together outside of the club (obviously take me shopping or go out to fancy dinner). And he made all these plans. It’s just so weird! But maybe he had a gf she found my stuff and deleted and blocked me or you’re right he’s just too chicken shit.
stripper,fjcxl08,t1_fjcjjm3,1583240094.0,Thanks boo. These reply’s made me feel better def!!
stripper,fjbredo,t3_fc6hgu,1583199764.0,"Girl I love couples!! They are my fav, girls tend to avoid women but I see an opportunity bc women want to feel special and wanted too. Then their man feels hot bc he sees her getting off. I genuinely like what I do, and women are my fav. If she made out with you I doubt she was faking it. Just enjoy it and have fun!! And know you made someone’s night amazing by spending money and giving them a good time, that is the best."
stripper,fjbqekq,t3_fchdhc,1583199142.0,Yassss girl get that bag!! Love it. Nothing feels better than money 😂😂😂

stripper,fj8nmig,t1_fj8n2zg,1583117621.0,"Exactly and I hope that didn’t sound mean. I was 179 and lost 30 got to 149, most of my weight is in my ass. I’ve gained ten pounds. I wear flattering clothes. I wear kixies to hide all of my cellulite, but you can’t do pole. I stick to floor work.
You can wear dresses also, check out booty king on Instagram he is the best!! I get so many compliments on my ass. It’s hard work to diet and workout I struggle so much, but the bag is nice!!"
stripper,fj8n72e,t1_fiye525,1583117326.0,"BE STRONG. guys will try to get away with anything and they will if you let them. I’m an assault victim as well, but stripping has been extreme empowering to my sexuality and helped me take my power back.
I think it can for you too!!"
stripper,fj8mxph,t3_fas4dn,1583117149.0,"I worked hard as fuck to lose 30 pounds so I could strip again. I still am usually the thickest girl where I’m dancing. I weigh 157. But I workout and lift weights 4-5 times a week. Guys love all types: not sure how it is there. I still need to lose more weight to match up with the girls at my club, I was lucky to get hired there bc I knew the door girl.
200 isn’t bad, not to sound mean but I’d lose more weight. You can always offer to pay more or work day shift while you lose weight. It also depends what your body shape is. Like is it mostly in your tits and ass or stomach? Guys love thick girls!!!"
stripper,fj8mg4l,t1_fj34rw6,1583116823.0,"Topless! I wouldn’t do full nude, guys try too much where I’m at with underwear. But girls make bank nude I hear!!"
stripper,fj8m5fk,t3_fbgj3h,1583116625.0,Ask your club what their drink names are for non alcoholic beverages so it doesn’t seem like you aren’t drinking. Don’t lose your job.
stripper,fj8m1lu,t3_fbhtwf,1583116554.0,"Good night to me is 800$ and above. If I make less I get sad. But we all have those nights! 1k and above is goals.

It depends too though if you’re in a big or small city, high traction club, or slower gentleman’s club. I think it varies city to city, plus taking into account cost of living."
stripper,fj8lrtk,t3_fbhxh4,1583116374.0,"Take Tylenol or ibuprofen. Ice is your best friend, hot bath with salts after work if you can. It will help with bruising too. I don’t like boots, but that’s just me. You get used to heels eventually, just don’t think about them think about the money instead 😂."

breakingmom,fj065vh,t3_faovwk,1582890625.0,"You’re absolutely doing the right thing. Contact police ASAP. This is my biggest fear as a mother due to being a victim myself when I was only 12. It’s awful and causes lifelong issues. At almost 30 I am barely regaining my stability.

Botox can be 300-500 depending on units 10$ a unit. Fillers I’ve paid for at most 650$ for one tube. There is juvaderm for under eyes and restylne* spelling? For lips, or I might have them flip flopped. Girl I would do both lol."

stripper,fil5zp5,t3_f8c5k1,1582494382.0,"I’ve danced on and off for ten years. It helped me pay my way through college to get my degree, I always was able to have nice things. 
There is so much more to it emotionally and physically though. Being a sex worker is not easy, it is fucking hard, there is a stigma attached to being a sex worker also. Growing up from the age of 18 I was judged soo much from family and friends but I loved my job!

I payed my bills, my rent, bought nice clothes shoes. Not that I’m older, I do have a full time job. I just started getting back into dancing but this time with clear goals set. When I was younger I never saved a dime, I ended up going to bartending and taking a pay cut. But that is when I realized the importance of saving and setting goals.

It was a very emotional time for me, and it’s a business it’s not always having fun, it’s hard fucking work.

Dealing with rejection, handys assholes, sometimes shady clubs. It teaches you so much about yourself and life. It’s not all bad! There is a lot of good you meet a lot of cool ass people, guys who love to take care of you.


Good luck! Google sex worker stories, check out the history of sex work. You’d be writing a novel home girl!"

They are doing something moving him to a different department and soon he will no longer be my boss.

They basically told me also to seek counseling on how to better handle situations like this. Because it’s a trigger.

Sooo yeah. Just trying to get through the rest of the day."

HR did nothing but give him a slap on the wrist. Not even moving his desk. So I will still have to sit next to this guy.
