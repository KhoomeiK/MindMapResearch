I just like the show. I also don't care if they go into a long format or just one offs with a loose narrative... I have just noticed that a lot of their work as of late is just complaining about having to tell a story

It's almost like seeing a band live for the first time, it's a reunion tour and you love how unique their music is so you decided to book tickets. You get there and 1/3 of their set list is bashing one dude in the crowd over and over again.

CharacterRant,f278dm1,t3_dbzvqj,1570032707.0,"I feel like Thor was the biggest letdown, followed by (to a much lesser extent) Hulk and Steve. 

I thought Professor Hulk was fine. I have almost no problem with how he was portrayed and I'm not even mad about him not getting a rematch with Thanos. My biggest issue with how he was handled was that all that development happened off-screen. Banners issue with control was more or less solved by the end of his first solo film, with a few accidental Hulk-outs here and there. After that,  the only thing they could really do to keep his character interesting was address that there were two personalities existing within the same person. Ragnarok seemes to hint at it and Infinity War made it seem like there would finally be a resolution between Hulk and Banner... But then Endgame happened and we get the scene in the diner. This scene was the writers basically saying  ""Yeah, he fixed the only real character flaw he had left and this is all the explanation we're gonna give you for it. Deal with it.""

Steve's ending is fine( ?) It would have made more sense if he didn't receive the development he got in TWS and AOU. Both of these films alluded to Steve needing to move on from the past and it seemed like he had made peace with that notion. I guess the biggest issue I have with his ending is that it doesn't completely gel (and almost kinda breaks) the time travel rules as stated by the film. 

Thor was comedic relief for the entirety of the film. He was notably the only character whose PTSD was played for laughs. Realistically, how much beer would a 1500 year old Asgardian with centuries of combat experience (who has already been shown onscreen to be a heavy eater/drinker) have to consume in order to go from absolute peak physical condition in Infinity War to what was shown in Endgame in just five years? As long as we've known Thor, he wanted to be ruler of his people. He finally gets it and after the whole Thanos thing, he gives it to another Asgardian *who spent centuries in exile drinking heavily with no change to her outward appearance* and just fucks off to space to find himself. It makes very little sense when you actually think for more than four seconds about the history of the characters in question. What actually happened was that Marvel Execs realized that Hemsworth has excellent comedic timing, and would pair well with a clown car full of equally funny characters."

Another scene in the book that I hope makes it into Chapter 2 is when Adult!Ritchie encounters It while back in Derry and a nearby toddler sees the clown and promptly looses his shit (the kid's mother doesn't understand why it's crying so profusely)

 Bill's Pennywise (in terms of design and performance) is just too overtly creepy like a spider with bright markings on it. You could argue that this version needs to be perceived that way because he needs his victims to be afraid, but Curry achieved this effect without 'Leto-ing'. 

There aren't any moments where Bill's Pennywise seems more than he appears to be, whereas Curry has moments of true gravitas:

They certainly get across how unhealthy the relationship dynamic that Dani and Christian through decent dialogue and blocking (ie: the use of mirrors during their earlier arguments) I also loved the unsettling atmosphere that permeated the film. I could see this happening to American tourists that are as stupid and self absorbed as this particular group of millennials

This film is nearly completely devoid of likeable characters or characters that behave like rational human beings (with the exception of Connie and her boyfriend, but even though they are done after the suicide ritual, they stick around and even attend the water goddess ceremony?) It makes the people you're supposed to care about during the course of the film *very* hard to root for. You may identify with some of these characters on a surface level but everyone has a moment that strains credulity. You could argue that they were tripping balls the entire so they didn't have much agency, but they weren't high the *entire* time. 

 Dani is needy and clingy to the point of being unbearable, yes she lost her parents and sister in a horrific murder/suicide, and no person would truly be OK after that, but this is something she never really deals with. She begins to cry at very first sign of a situation that isn't going her way. The last hour of the movie she is perpetually frowning (likeð) She never truly grows as a character... She just trades one social caste for another (which is only cuz Pelle likes her and she's the only character that doesn't do anything culturally insensitive) 

Christian was an idiot, just a fucking dumb person. Was he at all deserving of his ultimate fate...? Gotta say NO. He was kind of an opportunistic asshole but did he need to be burned alive in a bear carcass while paralyzed? Again, I gotta say **no**

Josh and Mark just fit the Scholar and Fool archetypes, with Josh being slightly better written and Mark being a caricature. 

When characters witness a suicide ritual, begin to disappear and no one (save for Connie) is asking real questions that any logical person would ask in a real world situation; especially in a foreign country... And **ESPECIALLY IN A CLEARLY PAGAN COMMUNE** And *continue to willingly take mind altering drugs* is when my immersion began to falter. They seem like sensible, intelligent people until they leave America 

Midsommar was decent, different (but not different enough) The most interesting stuff to me was Dani's sister and parents thread and how her boyfriend and his friends were treating her as a result. It's horribly predictable, but interesting to look at"

She appears out of literal thin air to eliminate the remaining threat for everyone. 

â¢ **SYD** WTF?! 
She never has to answer or atone for anything she did (which is very similar to what she accused David of doing). She's bitter to the very end with almost nothing positive to say throughout the entire season. If she was written competently, like she was in the first season, she could have been an interesting foil to David... HER POWER IS TAKING SOMEONES BODY AGAINST THEIR WILL!  HOW'S THAT FOR A RAPE ALLEGORY? In story, no one ever brings this up... It's like in the middle of Season 2 they wanted to bring up the philosophical and moral implications of rape but didn't want to actually explore it, have a discussion about it or tell a story that would actually have something profound to say about it Mind you, this could have been done with almost *all* of the main characters:
      
       *The Loudermilks (Living and in the body of a    sibling of the opposite sex) 
       *Ptonomy (Altering someones memory) 
       *Farouk (Lived in the body of another man for       33 years) 

If they actually stuck to their guns with the whole rape thread, they could have actually made it work

Legion didn't need more episodes, it needed a more tightly focused plot. If it weren't so busy trying to prove how smart and different it was, we could have had something special here. 

 And it was, for a time"
LegionFX,ewvsuki,t1_ewqrvpi,1565813222.0,"She was, narratively speaking, just a plot device. A means to an end. She had very little character and her motivation was unclear at best... Shame really, When the season started, I thought she was one of the more interesting concepts introduced. 

Turns out she's just a Deus Ex Machina"

LegionFX,ew9bprh,t1_ew6kxia,1565222752.0,"Endgame couldn't make it's mind up about how time travel worked in it's own film, hell the directors and writers still can't give a definite answer. 

In most works of fiction there are three main ways time travel is handled

â¢Star Trek: **Multiverse.** The very act of traveling back in time creates an alternate timeline (or universe)  where everything you effect remains changed. You do not alter any events in the original timeline you started from and you now exist in the timeline where all the changes have taken place 

â¢Back to the Future: **There is only one universe.** Anything you do will have a direct (and immediate) influence on the future. Only the time traveler is aware of the changes made and everyone else continues to exist as if nothing has been altered from their perspective 

â¢ Futurama: **Causality loop.** Time is an immutable circle and everything you go back to do, you have always done before. The past cannot be altered in any way. Every action you take will only end up causing the event you travel back to influence or change. You do not know this because you haven't gone back to do it yet. 

â¢Terminator: *All of the above*"
raimimemes,ew9964k,t3_cnazx3,1565221605.0,I absolutely love how everyone refers to it as 'Precious' Tritium
LegionFX,ew7y4yn,t1_ew6tszc,1565199546.0,"And as for the 'men' exchange:

Syd: ""You know, it's not crazy babies that worry me. It's the men they become. Like a fire, falling in love with a fire. We try to smother them, put them out, but they just burn us up.""

Gabrielle: ""It bothers you, because you think you matter."" 

Given the context, what do you think we're supposed to extrapolate from what Syd is saying here?"
LegionFX,ew7dct7,t1_ew6tszc,1565190105.0,"Well yes, he did, but she isn't there to avenge herself... Or so we're led to believe from the events of the previous episode. And I'm not saying she should forget it happened, if she was ever supposed to 'magically get over it', it should have happened when her character was rewritten (or reborn, whichever you prefer) 
 My real criticism is that she seems to have learned nothing after an episode that was supposed to make her a new person. 

An empathetic person, especially one with her powers; which by nature, is taking someone's body against their will (how's that for a rape allegory?) would at the very least try to understand where David came from. She of all people? Does no no one see the hypocrisy here?"
LegionFX,ew5ato2,t1_ew55pph,1565131790.0,Unless they take the 'casual loop' aspect of time travel and this ends up being a situation where they cause the very event they are trying to stop
LegionFX,ew4yg4n,t1_ew4mjaf,1565121705.0,"Yeah, once you introduce time travel it has to completely gel with literally everything or it falls apart under the simplest of scrutiny. And Once you go back as far as meeting the parent who supposedly banishes the evil before abandoning the main character, the only thing that you can do is alternate universe (Where everything is fine) or causality loop (Where everything you went back to change just caused the thing you tried to change)"
LegionFX,ew4xx6s,t1_ew3624f,1565121152.0,Yeah its really a shame how little actual development she got despite being one of the more interesting elements of season 3
LegionFX,ew4czta,t3_cml3sp,1565107992.0,"It seems interesting to me that after the last episode, Syd still doesn't seem to know what to do and the writers don't seem to know what to do with her... What's her plan? Is she waiting for adult David to show up? Does she know if he's going to show up? Is she waiting for David to grow up? Why not let the Time Eater kill him? Why is she being so vague to David's mother? The end of the previous episode gave us the impression that she knew what she was supposed to do, but it turns out that it's just kinda the same thing she's been doing this whole season 

They also seem to be doubling down on the ""She's the victim"" angle. I loved the first bit of interaction between her and David's mother where she basically says ""He's a men, and men never learn"" and Davids mother essentially trumps that argument while simultaneously recontextualizing the scope with ""Fuck all that shit, bitch. Have you ever seen a dead body?!"" This exchange was important because it forces Syd to focus on something other than her own perspective (Which is something we were led to believe she learned in the last episode) 

Later in the episode, during the Baby Hitler discussion with Kerry (who is basically screaming alright, we're here now, what do we do? And Syd's like 'lol idk')  at this point, Syd had the opportunity to make her motivation a little bit more altruistic, but she specifically says ""All the bad things he's going to do... To me"" (Again, does this sound like someone who just spent an entire episode learning empathy?)"
depression,ew4aehb,t3_cmrjww,1565106409.0,"Idk man, the definition of 'toxic' is pretty wide and almost entirely subjective. It basically refers to just about anything or anyone that 'Harshes Your Mellow"", and only caught on because this generation of people don't seem to realize that _everyone_ has their own thoughts and feelings. This leads to people ignoring concepts like empathy to completely serve the self, thereby giving them an excuse to create a reality where they are the best person in existence and everyone else that they give the privilege of their company to is only around to enforce how awesome they are. It also gives them the freedom to abandon certain relationships with no warning as opposed to owning up to their own mistakes and using two way communication as a means to handle whatever issue that may arise like responsible adults 

Human beings have to learn to deal with themselves and others. Of course, a particular balance is needed.

LegionFX,ew3jamu,t3_cmn65q,1565081783.0,"This was during season 2's 'experimental' phase. If I'm recalling this correctly, it was midway through the season when David kills the illusion monster and deals with his sisters death with the alternate universe episode. You get this overwhelming sense that things are approaching the end, and at this point all David needs to do is kill Farouk... But there was still five episodes left before the finale

So things had to get weird"

It doesn't have to be plot driven but it does need to tell a story. That story is about to end"
LegionFX,evx759c,t3_clqhxr,1564883773.0,"Posted this in the Chapter 25 discussion. I've had my share of issues with this show, but when the narrative is moving forward... it's great and compelling storytelling. That's why Season 1 is generally considered the best, it's a fairly linear plot and you got a sense that the characters were progressing and moving towards a singular goal. Season 2 was pretty good until about the halfway mark (When the seasons plot was more or less resolved and character motivations had been fulfilled... they just started making up shit to pad the runtime). Season 3 seems to be forcing itself towards a conclusion while still indulging itself from time to time

The concepts that are introduced, when they actually serve the plot, are genuinely interesting. It's when the show becomes too consumed with how smart and different it is that the whole thing comes off as pretentious and becomes a chore to watch. Every other episode I feel like there's at least one moment when I have to resist the urge to snap at the screen and say ""FOCUS! ADVANCE THE PLOT!""

I really hope Hawley can focus long enough to finish this story and I _REALLY_ hope it doesn't end with a musical number"
