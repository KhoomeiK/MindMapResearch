One small thing you can do is to give yourself compliments every day. Write down a few thinks you like about your body (if you feel like you hate everything, find the things you hate the least, or do the whole ‚Äúfake it til you make it‚Äù routine). Look in the mirror and repeat those things. 

Be kind towards yourself and treat yourself as if you loved your body. For me it was easier to change my actions than to change my thoughts. Personally I struggled a lot with food. So, I started to just eat, without letting the thoughts stop me. It took some time and some uncomfort and fear, but I feel a lot better around food now than a few months ago. Setting my foot down to my thoughts also felt very empowering, in a ‚Äúthis is my life and I‚Äôm in control, these thoughts can‚Äôt stop me‚Äù kind of way.

selfhelp,fj3mgyz,t3_fbbs50,1582987872.0,"I‚Äôm only speaking from personal experience. Idk if this is what you‚Äôre looking for, or if you in any way find this helpful, but here are some of the things that have helped me these pst few months:

Make a conscious decision to treat yourself with compassion. Whenever you have the opportunity to do something nice for yourself, do it (e.g. have a small dance party with yourself and some cheerful songs). Personally, I struggled a lot with feeling like I didn‚Äôt ‚Äúdeserve‚Äù happiness. I refused to do nice things for myself. So purposely being kind to myself by taking a bath or smelling some flowers has helped me a lot.

Take some time out of the day to focus on small activities that make you happy (if you don‚Äôt know what those activities are, set aside time to try out different hobbies). It‚Äôs easy to forget or neglect yourself, so having a plan on ‚Äúthis period of the day I‚Äôll spend on myself‚Äù and sticking to it can help. 

Say/write down affirmations like ‚ÄúI love myself‚Äù and ‚ÄúI forgive myself‚Äù whenever the thoughts get too loud. It might feel a bit dumb or useless, but fight fire with an exaggerated amount of self-love. Stop the self-depreciating jokes and comments. Instead, take note of the things you do well by giving yourself compliments. 

This sounds clishe, but journaling in general helps. Write down things you like about yourself. Even the tiniest things: ‚ÄúI like my taste in music‚Äù and ‚ÄúI think my eyes are pretty cool‚Äù. If you‚Äòre thinking ‚Äúwell I don‚Äôt like anything about myself‚Äù, write down what you hate the least. Write down things that spark even the smallest bit of joy. Write down things you are grateful for. Write down affirmations. Journaling has really helped me, even though I was very dismissive of it at first.

Changing your mindset takes effort. I took a ‚Äúfake it til you make it‚Äù approach by treating myself as if I was a happy, healthy person. I‚Äôd be overwhelmed by self-loathing and go ‚Äúwhat would a happy person do?‚Äù. For me, that meant consciously thinking about the positives to drown out my built-in negativity, and being aggressively kind to myself. 

Furthermore, I also came to the realization that in the end, the biggest thing holding me back in life was myself. I was the one causing myself all this suffering, and for what? I was imprisioned by my own mind. That realization kind of empowered me, because I realized that I was the only one who could save myself and break free. The responsibility I felt drove me to want to be better. This is my life, and I owed it to myself (and my future self) to work for it to be a happy life. 

Hopefully this didn‚Äôt sound too clishe or messy, lol. These are just my genuine experiences. I‚Äôd also recommend the r/DecidingToBeBetter subreddit. I‚Äôm rooting for you. :)
