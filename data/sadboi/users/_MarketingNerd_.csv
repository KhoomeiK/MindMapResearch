Advice,fr1x3es,t3_gm4nxs,1589827397.0,"You can’t control your emotions. You can control your actions. 

You do not need to be heartless to stand your ground.

I’m absolutely sure that I’ve said this in my lifetime. I’m a sensitive person too as a 31M. I know that it probably feels like something is wrong with you because you’re not a stereotypical male in some ways. But the more you try to be someone you are not, the more you will get hurt or hurt others.

One of the biggest revelations in my life is that I caused more pain in my life by pretending to be something I wasn’t. I’d try to be what people wanted me to be. I tried to be what I thought I should be (cold, emotionless, distant). When all of that backfired in my face, I’d react irrationally with an outburst of emotions and push people farther and farther away from me.

What will help you is to accept yourself as the person you are and to work on defining your boundaries.

Assertiveness comes from surety. Sure in who you are (not who you want to be) and sure of what you want. It’s not the opposite of emotions. It’s not letting your emotions control you and being confident in your outcomes moving forward.

It sucks people hurt you. It sucks even more that you blame yourself for it. But it’s okay to be sensitive and it’s okay to be yourself. Emotions and all."

Judging by your responses I think that you are an ENFP personality type (same as I am). Logical analyses, people-pleaser mentality, and thriving on attention is very common in this personality type. (Think Michael Scott from the Office or Jake Peralta from Brooklyn 99) 

You might find some insight by taking a personality test and reading more about what people say about it in other sub-reddits.

datingoverthirty,fof3e3u,t3_g752ip,1587724588.0,"You should consider reading the book ""Attached"" by Rachel S.F. Heller & Amir Levine. It will give you more insight on different attachment styles as they relate to relationships. I would highly recommend counseling as well. Many of these feelings/behaviors stem from your upbringing or home life. Working through them will help you feel more secure.

As an anxious personality type myself, the best advice I can give you is to keep reading about neediness in relationships and ways to improve. I was an attention-seeking and irrational teenager/young adult. It wasn't until I started reading more about my need for attention that I started to change my behavior.

I'd also like to share that attention-seeking behavior isn't always a bad thing in small doses. It's only an issue when you rely on it to fill an emotional void and you try to control the actions/behaviors of others. I've always been an outgoing personality type and a lot of things I do in crowds would be considered ""attention-seeking behavior"" but it's also what makes me unique. Most of my social ability is driven by standing out. There's a fine line.

After you understand what causes this type of behavior and you observe your actions that causes the neediness, you'll be much more effective at changing your behavior. It will also show you how common people use attention-seeking behavior and are unaware. The biggest indicator is social media comments. Most people will try to find some fulfillment through comments on Instagram posts or trying to be recognized by popular creators. You're certainly not alone in your actions, but it's good that you understand you need to change things in your behavior.

Good luck in your journey! You're on the right track!"

SocialMediaMarketing,fngta20,t3_g1o1et,1586944137.0,"There are a considerable amount of comedians that are posting their short videos on TikTok. They also post the on Instagram and I have yet to find one that posts on Twitter. In my observation, it’s helping them grow their other channels (mostly YouTube and IG).

While it’s good to diversify your content to suit your audiences, if your goal is exposure then you’re limiting yourself by only posting content on one medium. Reposting on Instagram or TikTok provides you with easy content for exposure to a new audience.

If I was a comedian, I’d focus on IG and YouTube  content then use TikTok to repost that content. TikTok would drive traffic to my IG which would have content of my shows and posts that I could use to boost brand value (e.g. relating to my followers, interacting with followers, and finding out what they like about my content or what they want to see). YouTube would have longer video content where I’d show more of my shows or perhaps vlogging my experience as a comedian like behind the scenes or a day in the life. I would have a twitter account, but I would use that to tell jokes or post meme-type videos because that would drive engagement a lot more than parts of my stand up shows.

Hopefully that helps. The TL;DR is that you don’t need original content on each specific platform to get value from them. You just want people to see it and be directed to the platform(s) you focus on."

> I play that stuff over and over in my head and I think they’re right. I really do think I am the problem.

> I don’t know how I allow these things to happen. If I am the common denominator in these situations, then I am the problem. 

That’s not necessarily true. Just because you’re the denominator does not make you the problem. You can only control your actions; not someone else’s actions, emotions, or feelings.

> But I am a shitty person who is not deserving of love. 

This is 100% not true. Everyone deserves love and you might have done things you regret or that you don’t like, but that does not dictate your present or future. You can always become a better version of yourself. Always.

> On top of that, I’m a sensitive crybaby bitch and I hate myself for even being sad. I have no right to be sad. 

It’s okay to feel sad. It’s normal to have emotions and it’s okay to feel exactly the way you are feeling right now. It’s okay.

You have every reason to feel the way you are feeling. You have a lot of stuff going on emotionally. It seems like you generally keep these emotions to yourself because you either feel guilty or possibly embarrassed. However, keeping this kind of stuff in will make things worse. You will act irrationally and you will project things onto others. It’s normal, but it will help you to express what you have going on to someone who will listen. Ideally a therapist. Start there and work through everything you’re feeling. You will feel like a big burden is lifted off your shoulders. I hope the best for you and I believe you can get through this. You are not a problem or an issue. You’re a human that’s going through a hard time and that’s normal. It’s okay to feel what you’re feeling. It gets better, I promise."

The thing with my friend is that it’s very clear he has a struggle being his personality type. He was very dependent on alcohol to compensate for social interaction. He’s stayed away from alcohol for the most part over the last few years but he is considerably less social. That’s where I, as an ENFP, can really shine. Despite his superficial shell I know that he’s got a lot of internal struggle. I can perceive when he’s got an issue and I can be empathetic to his situations through very few context clues.

Kinetic grasp can block ults from McCree or soldier (provided your dps/support know to stay behind you during it).

His ult can be useful against one person, if it’s the right person. I’ll use it on a nano’d genji so my team can run away or just not die to it. I’ll also use it to secure kills on one healer or even force other ults like sound barrier or trans.

In a sense, it would ""stroke her ego"" but it's not as simplified as that. She would feel necessary in the relationship and that would appeal to her sense of duty to stay in it. It's not about her feeling like she's better than you or anything like that. Hearing how someone feels to an ENFP will disarm the defenses they have.

Most of my first dates with INFJs we talk in a second language for the first few dates... that language being pure sarcasm.

That being said, I agree with the opposite of understanding. In my perspective, I think INFJs would be initially turned off to our personality because they couldn't fathom someone being so playfully social... but once there is a connection made, INFJs will go from being turned off to being curious.

Your insecurity of loyalty is like ENFP kryptonite. ENFP's tend to be extremely loyal and to some (like myself) it's something to be prideful about in our personality type. I know that I'm fiercely loyal. However, when someone that I'm loyal to starts showing that they don't trust me... it makes me question that connection. It would feel like you're trying to micromanage our relationship and I would get annoyed really quickly.

The counterpoint here is that I would be quick to burn the bridge like your friend did. However, I wouldn't say no to a reconnection either. I used to have a terrible habit of burning bridges for attention, but that's manifested in cutting contact to distancing myself when I know I need space from someone. Does that mean I never want to speak to them again? No. If an ex girlfriend or friend wanted to talk to me again... I know that I would accept their invitation to reconnect somewhere down the line.

Here's how you could possibly mend the situation without assuming everything is completely over:

1. If you can, acknowledge her need to distance from you. Recognize her need to distance herself from you, reinforce that you accept that decision, and inform her that you are willing to reconnect in the future if that's what she would like to do. If someone said that to me, it would make me feel less trapped or like I'm not being pressured to make an effort when I know I have a just cause to feel the way I do.
2. When/if you reconnect, don't blame yourself or her. Just say you value the relationship you've had and you're working on getting over insecurity issues. Then let her know why you value the relationship you had with her. ENFPs tend to respond more to people in need as empathizers. Telling about how integral your relationship is will appeal to that.

I don't think your relationship is completely done with her... many ENFPs will get over things fairly quickly but not want to reconnect because it feels awkward or assume the other person doesn't want to hear from them. If you make yourself available, she would be more likely to respond.

Again, not everyone would handle the situation like I do and this is just my perspective. You clearly know her well. Use that understanding to make the best decisions moving forward."

ENFP,ff56tx1,t3_ernpu3,1579581903.0,"I've been this person for most of my life but in varying degrees. In my earlier years, I would do the craziest and stupidest things to cause a scene. Partially because of my personality and partially because of my upbringing with not getting enough attention from my parents. My favorite thing to do as a teenager was to pull my pants down to show my boxers... yep... no shame.

However, this behavior evolved over time. I still do things over the top, but I'm smart enough to read the room when doing so. I've learned to choose my audience carefully and really have turned it into apart of my charm instead of just looking stupid to get attention.

As an example, during a customer appreciation night at my previous job, the director of sales told me I couldn't walk in her shoes just yet. Me, a male CSR and new to the company, took that challenge literally and wore her high heels around a bar for a few minutes to show that I could, in fact, walk in her shoes. Was it silly? Yes. Did I make a fool out of myself? Yes. However, I also won a lot of people over and didn't lose any respect in the process. It actually helped me to gain respect from a lot of people, including the director of sales and my immediate manager.

I've learned there's a line. Knowing when to turn on the silly/goofy side and when to be serious is something that will make your personality work in your favor (To me, it's my unique selling point). Think of it like you're Superman... you can't always be Superman, sometimes you have to be Clark Kent. When Superman needs to come out, you'll always save the day."

Leadership told us several times that they treat these as *actual cases* of ND. I now largely suspect that this was a threat to only lower enlisted and that they did not expect NCO's to be the ones to ND. Those NCO's had nothing happen to them, no demotion, no paperwork, and not even a talk from the commander or 1sg to talk about the 'dangers of negligently discharging your weapon on a base'. It just blew over.

Sadly, this was not the worst thing that happened in pre-deployment or even on deployment. I do have some satisfaction on watching one of the biggest mouthed E6's that thought he was the next MOH honoree break into tears when he fired his M4 into a clearing barrel. It actually made him shut up for once.

smallbusiness,fefov18,t3_eov9pa,1579061129.0,"I'm not sure what your social circle is like, but I would offer 20-30 bucks to anyone who wants to draw a logo for you. You could give out some shirts as consolation prizes as well! Using your high school will really be beneficial with marketing your shirts too...

Give your friends some free shirts to wear around. Get people to post on their social media with your shirts and logo. Might help to use TikTok (yea, I said it) just because of the algorithm being local at first then spreading out as it grows in popularity.

Since prom is coming up, you could maybe run special made tshirts that have names on them asking someone to prom. Charge a little more for these so you can make more shirts in the future. 

If you wanted to go above and beyond you could make: Graduation shirts, homecoming shirts, and event/club shirts. Custom shirt + your label could be a pretty big deal locally. If you champion your local market, you could expand pretty rapidly after that. Especially if your high school is big enough. If more people in the local area (your town + adjacent towns) see your shirts, the more likely they are to buying them. If you want more ideas or some help creating a plan feel free to ask!"

I was really good friends with an ex-girlfriend (we dated for a few months in high school, this was several years later). When me and my girlfriend at the time hung out with my ex and her boyfriend, me and my ex would always get along. We have good playful banter, similar sense of humor, and a lot of things that could be misconstrued. While we were not attracted to each other, her boyfriend would always act very strange around me. It's very obvious to me that he was threatened by our relationship even though we were very much plutonic. We just got along very well.

I would suspect that George had a hard time coping with their relationship which was most likely pretty close. They've known each other for 30 years and a relationship like that to someone who is insecure can be threatening. That doesn't excuse George's behavior by any means, but it could be the cause for the mistrust. That would make sense seeing as he tried to catch OP in the act, unsuccessfully.

Advice,fcx4x1n,t3_ej6no5,1578051370.0,"While I’ve never been this level of a “nice guy”, I do have the understanding of the types of behavior and mindset that  they think from first hand experience. Hopefully this helps you understand how terrible his mentality is and why it might be a good idea to not let this go.

> I drank a lot of tequila while B only had a beer or two, he wasn’t very drunk at all. 

This is a yellow flag and seeing as he said what he did about the reasoning is borderline predator behavior. 

> First thing B says is “(my name), did you squirt on the couch?” 

> B walks past the door and goes “getting naked  already?”

This is him trying to open up the idea of you two having a sexual conversation... it’s passive aggressive and attention seeking behavior. It also shows his plan of trying to get with you that night.

> He was also being a dick to A. He kept asking me to pick the music and I told him I don’t care and to let A pick a song, he said something like A has shitty taste in music. 

This is typical “nice guy” behavior... he thinks he’s a better  choice. Insulting your ex is basically him trying to show how much of a “better pick” he is than your ex.

> Weirdest part of the night though was this: As I said, B was making fun of A for not taking a shot of tequila I poured him. I was sitting on the couch and said “B, why don’t you drink it?” And A kind of joined in and was like “yeah B, you’ve only had one beer!” B turns to A and says “The reason I won’t get too drunk tonight is sitting right there on the couch, I’ll leave it at that.” I said “who, me?” genuinely confused about what he meant. He ignored me and kept directing his dialogue towards A. B then says “I’ll be honest since we’ve been drinking, A, the only thing keeping me from that (points at me) is friendship, I wouldn’t do that to you.” 

It didn’t get more cringe than this.... this is textbook “nice guy” behavior. Exclaiming how he’s going to take the moral high ground... if you were absolutely trashed and for some reason threw yourself at him... I’d bet he’d have taken advantage of that and not stopped you. That’s something to think about since he was quite sober.


> Now B is acting like it’s all fine. I’m uncomfortable but I hate confrontation. I’m nice to B but not flirty at all, I haven’t given him reason to think I’m interested. How should I approach this?

When you confront him he’s going to make every excuse in the book to defend his actions. Do not accept any of these answers. He will also try to turn it around on you or A. Don’t let him talk you out of this or play the victim. This kind of behavior is unacceptable and he is not a good friend to either of you. Confronting him head on is a good approach. Best case scenario is he moves out, assuming he has some sense and recognizes his behavior was unacceptable and made everyone feel uncomfortable.

I hope this helped. I’m sorry you were put in that situation. Good luck!"
