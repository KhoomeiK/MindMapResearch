I had an employee come to work about 15 years ago distraught because her home had been robbed.

Sure enough, a few weeks later the guns they kept in that safe were used in an armed robbery. The police were able to get one of the guns back. 

So folks, remember to bolt your gun safe to the ground, lock your gun with a gun lock in that safe, unloaded, so that it won't ever be used to hurt you, your family or loved ones... Of course, it probably won't protect you given the time it takes to undo all those mechanisms."
AskReddit,fq4k6av,t1_fpxobe1,1589078791.0,"It is a simple game theory problem. You need a gun because the person robbing your house might have a gun. But let's step back a second...

What is the proper punishment for a B&E? Someone breaks into your house to steal your electronics and jewelry. What should their punishment be? Unless you think it should be the death penalty, there there is something odd about the situation. What is it about the situation that makes you feel more the comfortable or entitled but **required** to have a gun?

Well, it is because the assailant might have a gun. And why might the assailant have a gun? Well, because the assailant is worried you might have a gun.

So, there are a set of possible outcomes...

Neither has a gun, and either the robber proceeds and robs the house or is scared off. -- 1 scenario loss of $, 1 scenario loss of nothing
The assailant has a gun, and you don't. Either the robber proceeds and robs the house and shoots you or the robber proceeds and robs the house and doesnt shoot you or the robber is scared off thinking you have a gun. 1 scenario loss of life, 1 scenario loss of $, 1 scenario loss of nothing. 
The assailant doesn't have a gun, you do. Either the robber proceeds and you shoot him, the robber proceeds and you don't shoot him, or robber runs away. 1 scenario loss of life, 1 scenario loss of $, 1 scenario loss of nothing.
Both have a gun. Either the robber proceeds and shoots you, Robber proceeds and you shoot robber, or robber runs away. 1 scenario loss of $ and life, 1 scenario loss of life, 1 scenario loss of nothing.

So lets look at the scenarios where you have a gun..

Outcomes: 3 outcomes involve a death (1 you, 2 assailant), 2 scenarios include loss of $, 2 scenarios loss of nothing.

Now, lets look at scenarios where you dont have a gun

Outcomes: 1 scenario loss of life , 2 scenarios loss of $, 2 scenarios loss of nothing.

You do the math. If you think the robber deserves to die, then it probably makes sense to you to own a gun."

Does that make sense? 

A person can only be a member of the set iff they can receive, assess, and pass on the paper. Person ω1 would not be able to receive, thus they could not be a member of the set... but that would then collapse the whole set as we remove ω1 over and over again."

Where is this article you are talking about? I have now watched 3 Katie Ball segments related to this and she never points out the New York Times...

She does however point out ""Times Up"" didn't take her case, but that is a different Times. I think what you are referring to is [this story by Democracy Now](https://www.democracynow.org/2020/4/13/headlines/nyt_reports_on_tara_reades_joe_biden_sexual_assault_allegation_but_retracts_mention_of_prior_sexual_misconduct) regarding a change in the article in which the NY Times for removing ""beyond hugs, kisses and touching that women previously said made them uncomfortable"" from the phrase ""We found no pattern of sexual misconduct by Biden, beyond hugs, kisses and touching that women previously said made them uncomfortable"". This did not

And the ""why now"" claim is relevant because **she has escalated her claims in a very short time.** Her [original claim](https://www.theunion.com/news/nevada-county-woman-says-joe-biden-inappropriately-touched-her-while-working-in-his-u-s-senate-office/) was that he touched her neck in a way that made her uncomfortable and said that he said her legs looked good. Harassment, yes. Sexual assault? No.

So let's recap important points.

- Approximately ~8 women have accused him of touching their hair, head, necks or making comments that made them feel uncomfortable. 
- 1 woman has made a claim of actual assault.
- She does not remember where this happened (to her best recollection some empty corridor in the Capitol)
- She does not remember when it happened.
- She did report this to police or to staff but *did claim to file a complaint about harassment*
- In her interview with Kristen Ball, she claimed she was wearing a skirt but nothing under (not impossible, but a bizarre choice for a visit to the capitol) (I am not trying to make a claim her about any sexual impropriety on her part, just a peculiar detail) 
- She pointed multiple individuals out by name who were in his office at the time that she claimed to have shared harassment but not sexual assault info with (both women and men): Baker, Kauffman and Toner. Neither of them have any recollection of this event.
- She has offered [multiple](https://web.archive.org/web/20090215042015/http:/thewip.net/contributors/2009/02/defying_the_rule_of_thumb_a_do.html) [reasons](https://web.archive.org/web/20190404032244/https:/medium.com/@shewrites94/bring-on-the-light-bf4e8c859058) for leaving Washington DC after her work w/ Biden's office, neither of which had anything to do with Biden. 
- She actually begins her [article on her encounter with domestic abuse](https://web.archive.org/web/20090215042015/http:/thewip.net/contributors/2009/02/defying_the_rule_of_thumb_a_do.html) by praising Biden's work on the Violence Against Women Act, supposedly ~7 years after he violently sexually assaulter her.
- She [deleted](http://thewip.net/contributors/2009/02/defying_the_rule_of_thumb_a_do.html) the [writings](https:/medium.com/@shewrites94/bring-on-the-light-bf4e8c859058) that contradicted her claims.
- The two office interns with whom she worked most closely were not aware of the harassment or the sexual assault claim.
- The recent police report she filed does not mention Biden by name."
DebateAChristian,fndf2mu,t1_fnb1wkq,1586868423.0,">  it uses evil acts as proof that God does not cause everything that he knows to be true

No it doesn't. Molinism holds that God's corresponding Will accompanies every free act. This means God does cause acts to occur which are referentially evil from the perspective of the free individual, but are not referentially evil from the perspective of God. A good example of this would be a teacher in a classroom watching as one child picks up a crayon to color on another child's paper. The teacher knows that this is wrong, but she also needs the first student to learn a lesson about not leaving her artwork laying around the classroom (as she has been warned not to, many times before). The teacher permits the wrong action (drawing on someone else's paper). The student who drew on the paper committed a wrong action, but the teacher did not, despite the fact that the teacher could have intervened.
