I'm pretty sure at this point I have PMDD as the mental and physical symptoms seem to fit the descriptions however in order to get that diagnosis and and possible treatment I would need to go to a doctor and that isn't going to happen due to the agoraphobia. 

It's hard enough being a woman with our hormones and menstrual cycles but add a mental illness aspect and basically we are just fucked."

Agoraphobia,fj4og38,t3_fbhm21,1583013044.0,"I lived in a lovely rented home when I first developed agoraphobia at 21, because of it I lost my job and could no longer pay my rent so had no choice but to move back in with my mother. I was devastated about the situation and the actual move was ridiculously difficult but it had to happen. 

My illness worsened and I got to the point where I would dehydrate myself so I didn't have to leave my room to go to the bathroom. I didn't leave my room at all for a long time so my mum had to bring me food and drink or I didn't get any. I was a mess with mental illness and agoraphobia. 

I lived with my mum for around 5 years. I hated every minute of it and once I started progressing slightly I knew I had to get out. Eventually, thanks to government assistance, I got a flat. I've been living in my flat for just over 5 years and I'm still agoraphobic but i am independent. That's a huge thing for me, to have my independence even though I am mostly housebound. I still rely on help for my mum when I am having a bad time and can't deal with deliveries of food. 

My point is simple - it sucks living with parents because of the agoraphobia, it can make you feel even more trapped at times but it's a necessary evil and has it's purpose. Allow yourself the time to get stronger and then there may be other options for you."

The state of my teeth completely affects my depression today, I feel disgusting because I still don't brush (now due to pain rather than depression, I do however use mouthwash and floss) and I hate to be seen because of my missing teeth.

But then I realised the positives. We aren't haunted by images because we can't see them, our minds have developed so many different ways to process imagination. It's genuinely amazing when you think about it.
