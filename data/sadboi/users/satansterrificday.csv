Also—people who end up having problems in general or are just looking for the FASTEST SEX POSSIBLE have always used a line about physical looks early on, even simple statements. So my general feeling about it is—you swiped me, but you don’t know me so why don’t you take a moment to get to know me before you decide what you like or don’t like. 

Also physical comments in general might be a bit boring for women. You want to sleep with me (generalization) and think I’m “cute”. Yay. 

However—I think it’s okay to compliment something you truly like. Especially if it’s specific. I think women do this more often to other women—haircut is flattering, fun dress, like the picture with your dog etc.

I’m on my second (?) round of OLD now and I have a new assumption that I will NOT find a viable relationship from it or someone who is open, vulnerable, flexible, available—but rather that I’m more likely to just get laid.

datingoverthirty,fotks8j,t1_fot3mfo,1588057014.0,"Always stick to reality not to the story being drafted for you or by you. If you’re currently dealing with someone with a personality disorder you may want to keep a journal to bullet point reality and instances after they occur. You can always look back and rely on these factual scenarios rather than others perceptions or feelings. 

Those with PD may be keen on distorting your reality and if you’re attracted to PDs then you may also habitually distort your own reality. 

This may work for the short term but also understand that PDs may have long term goals of manipulation and control that will be much more stressful or financially challenging to escape from later on. 

You may be able to discuss this with a therapist or professional to offer you better advice. You may also need help differentiating appropriate behaviors and boundaries as well—PDs sometimes seek out people who are not able to do this well for themselves because they are easier to break down. 

Last, you describe many positive things about this person but remember that you don’t “have to” put up with or agree to anything. If ASPD is a dealbreaker, then it’s a dealbreaker, and it’s your right to walk away and find something more suitable for you and your future. Your life purpose is not to enable or “help” someone with a PD and it is not your responsibility. There is someone out there who can offer you genuine love and care."

But I’ve a question! At the end of your third point you say that this set up allows you to bring up “you know a girl likes you when”...are you referring to touch specifically and do you verbally let them know its okay if they do that? 

I (f) used to be a really outgoing person but realized I was probably crossing others’ boundaries and have taken a big step back regarding touch. Now I’m nervous about it and wish I could initiate something without potentially making someone uncomfortable."

datingoverthirty,foj5237,t3_g6n1xn,1587808674.0,"I understand that you’ve mentioned needing to work on communication skills and that’s a great point, but I think the moments where you feel the sensation of “why doesn’t he just break up with me” types of thoughts are more important than building communication. 

If you’re not sure what you’re communication then good communication skills may not achieve much or may cause even more frustration. I think the anxiety you’re feeling involving you’re own insecurities (or—you’d know better what, exactly) are both A) perhaps not entirely related to moving in or him or this relationship but something from the past and B) are scrubbing away at all of your efforts at a couple and taking over via your anxiety. 

I think the first step would be to understand these feelings better and where they may be coming from. This could fix some of the problems automatically or give you better grounding for your discussions. 

I find that partners WANT to help you and be there for you but you have to know what that is without projecting it. 

If I’m way off in my assessment I mean no harm, I just find that when discussions don’t go well, it’s often because feelings are used to direct conversations instead of understanding the feelings and then taking action where needed."
datingoverthirty,foj3ygi,t1_fogb2p4,1587807424.0,"That’s good too but perhaps you need to know what your own limitations or preferences are for dating and be more upfront about them with yourself/others. 

I find this really tricky though as social expectations which are altered tend to have an unpredictable magnitude of repercussions. But perhaps after you figure out what some of those boundaries are (such as with money, paying for things, lack of consideration from partners whatever they may be) you can figure out how to be flexible while getting to know others and being true to yourself. 

Those who take major issue with your boundaries will likely show themselves early on and it will help move the process along for everyone."

datingoverthirty,fn53rrs,t3_fzgp60,1586655230.0,"The later two regarding emotional availability and finances/lifestyle are somewhat different that the characteristics above (fun etc). 

I think those two are more related to how behaviors are acted out which construct one’s entire life and so forth. You can find someone with a variety of combined personality traits who you get along with and another person with a different set of traits—but the larger behaviors which direct their life developments are also essential. 

Emotional communication for instance is not only a trait but a set of skills and you also have your own controls/maturity/boundaries defining these things. If they’re unmatched it would lead to two people essentially taking different paths. They’re important to maintain because they’re not only represented by the other person but the other’s cooperation is in line with your own personal boundaries regarding emotions/communication and so on. 

I wish I had some tips for finding an individual who matches the “personality” and also the “life maturity” (however those things are defined by someone). I suppose this is why there seem to be a lot of people who put the major things “on the table” from early on.
