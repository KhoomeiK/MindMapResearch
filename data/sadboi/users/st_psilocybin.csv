AppalachianTrail,fnzmxnk,t1_fnzf41a,1587397105.0,"this is a creative piece that was meant to take irreverent jabs at all identities and cultures mentioned and represented within it. I served southern appalachia an exceptionally low blow by taking the creative liberty of renaming it ""CUNT (Christian Union of New True) America,"" and I almost regret that I did, based on some comments the story has gotten. Southern Appalachia is a disadvantaged and ill-represented region. When editing, I felt some hesitancy in keeping the name that could be construed as hateful. Many people in southern appalachia are wonderful, kindhearted, good people with beautiful souls. The culture has it's flaws, just like any. However it is also a diverse place that has received inaccurate and unfair representation in mainstream media for decades. My intention was not to serve an attack on individuals of the area who already are subject to negative stereotypes and biases from the rest of the world. I did not intend to attack the culture either, rather the state governments of that region, the majority of which prove over and over to be unable to uphold one of the most noble intentions of our founding fathers: keep State and Church separate.   
  
  
Often, the Church that is brought into the State in these cases isn't even representative of true Christianity anyway.   
  
  
Dragging this theme out would have taken away the ironic lighthearted energy I wanted the story to have. I wanted to touch on stereotypes and identity politics without making them the core of the story, which would have caused it to slip into becoming a prickly regurgitated basket of hivemind vomitus.  
  
I appreciate the feedback!"

I meant for dude-bro to be a bit more complex character than you're taking him as. Not your fault as a reader, but rather mine as a writer. I'll take it as constructive feedback. Thank you"
AppalachianTrail,fnxw92p,t1_fnxq401,1587347690.0,"Absolutely. I did feel like I was pushing it a bit with that--I think southern Appalachia gets a pretty undeserved bad rap with all that, the people are truly mostly fantastic. I'm currently living in Wisconsin & altho I'm white so I can't speak directly on this, the levels of racist attitudes *seem* similar up here. Homophobia is something I experience directly, and that's the same everywhere except major cities.  
I ultimately went ahead with using that piece in the story, because state governments of southern states have proven themselves over and over again to be unable to separate church and state, and to uphold some pretty regressive policies. It wasn't meant as an attack on the people of southern Appalachia, just their governments and the culture of intolerance that does exist there (which exists everywhere in varying proportions).  
Thank you bringing this up."

I work in a SUPER small town and spend only 1 night a week there, usually at a gas station parking lot or side street. Other nights, I'll either drive 20 minutes to the next town over and park on a residential street, drive 30 minutes to a trailhead, drive to a different town, etc. Sure you'll spend a bit more on gas with all that driving, but its really not unreasonable, especially if it's important to you to keep for your car from being recognised. Heck, some people who live in houses live 30 minutes drive or more from their job & drive that every day on top of paying rent."

urbancarliving,fmtxd8c,t1_fmt9vi1,1586380691.0,"Yeah, I know I've been saying it for over a week now but I am seriously going to make a video soon... but a short answer for you right now, I store a couple items in my passenger seat. It frees up space in the back, and I don't mind if people look at my passenger seat & think I'm messy. Others will suggest a roof rack, but that can be expensive. Also, if you feel like your car is really cramped and you have no other options right now, its okay to spend a lot of time outside of your car for your sanity. Usually I'd recommend coffee shops or libraries but obviously not an option right now. Parks are great. 
The BEST option is to minimize as much as you can. I have about 1/3rd of the amount of stuff I tried to live with last time I was car-dwelling. Others might look at my setup and think I still have too much, but at this point I'm simply not able to part with anymore. If keeping a box full of old journals (my most ""unecessary"" item) and art projects costs a feeling of being slightly cramped, that's a price I'm willing to pay for that. Some stuff is just irreplaceable.  
Keep your eye open for storage options if you have some items like that. Often, people are willing to help more than you think. (I have a canoe in storage at my aunts house & have had people offer to store my art-box for me but I declined because I dont trust them very much. But I have other people I could ask if I wanted I just dont).  
In the meantime, just do some tetris & I hope something from all that helps!"

While that might be true, I can have that in a few weeks if I just stay put.

Now she doesn't even care about exceeding her own personal best.  The problem is that she now only exists to turn her son into a person.
