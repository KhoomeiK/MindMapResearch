I was able to play for an hour at a time when it first released, and other games as well before that (Containment Initiative, Space Pirate Trainer, SUPERHOT) without any issue. I've also seen the battery drain while plugged in, so that has to be it.

Not surprised about your root cause being Windows Defender. In my experience troubleshooting, AV scanners very seldom do any good outside of actual scanning for viruses (even then aren't always that great at keeping up) and can very easily run system performance into the ground.

The Nice Guy Friendzone Fantasy.

In reality, you have two choices: 

1. Accept that you will only ever be their friend and be *truly* at peace with it. Know the day will come where they'll meet and have a romantic interest, and the right thing for you to do will be to be supportive and genuinely happy for her.

2. Walk away, even if it means sacrificing the friendship. It sucks, it hurts and it's not fair. Yet, the worse alternative is letting the longing for more, and the resentment that you can’t and likely never will have it, corrode the friendship from the inside out. 

This won't be how everyone sees it. In the end you have to do what's right for you, not for the friendship, even if it means sacrificing it for your own health. If nothing else, take some time to figure out what's best.

FreeCompliments,f3ckjll,t3_dghwqc,1570825106.0,"I've just jumped back into the dating pool after a protracted breakup over the summer. I've gotten a lot more attention than I have in years past, and due to past experiences I'm not letting myself get excited over anything.

If I got a match with you, I would be flipping out and flattered to the point where it would be such a confidence boost, that it almost wouldn't even matter if you ever responded to a message. You are absolutely stunning.

Your EX-boyfriend made his bed, now he has to lie in it and second guess himself forever, while you get to move onto someone better, once you've gotten him out of your system. Your smile will return in time, and your tears will stop flowing. You'll be stronger and happier for it."
BPD,f3bb33o,t1_f38ffds,1570806103.0,I'm sorry! That song's had a special place in my heart since '94 and now it has a new dimension of meaning after the diagnosis. Did not mean to make you sobby. Today will be better!

People who cheat in relationships are the some of the weakest among us. It's never a reflection of you. Still, I'm sorry as hell for him doing that at such a critical time. I hope you're able to heal as soon as you can and find someone worthy."

modelmakers,f32ux66,t3_dffbyz,1570626633.0,"Looks awesome. How is the kit overall? I built Academy's Enola Gay kit and it was a nightmare. Like, no single part went together cleanly with very few anchors."
FreeCompliments,f2xztxa,t1_f2xswfs,1570484470.0,"Hard to tell with the noise, but I think it just dies. I can tell it's happened when it starts slowing down and the throttle stops responding. As soon as I stop, bike shuts off. I try to restart, engine turns over but never actually starts. Won't start again for roughly ten minutes. Happened in cool and warm weather. Have tried running half a cup of Seafoam through it a few times, with no change.

The one time it was different was right after the air filter had been replaced, as it was black to the point where even sunlight wouldn't get through. Took it out on the highway, died about ten minutes in, but it actually started back up within less than a minute. Rode it another 20 or so miles at around 60-70, didn't happen again. 

Then a few weeks later it happened and wouldn't start for ten minutes, like before."
SciFiModels,f2w6u5t,t1_f2rzw3o,1570462066.0,"Fair point. From what I've seen with the Bandai builds I've done so far, their level of detail and craftsmanship as far as how well the pieces fit together is second only to Tamiya. 

Dude, I would love Alien kits so much. Sulaco, Narcissus, Dropship -- all of it. They could even do the Power Loader like a Gundam type kit."
