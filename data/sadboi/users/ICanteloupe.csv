To be a good healer you have to be aware of where the enemies are so you dont get flanked, AND keep track of where all your teammates are in case they need healing.

The main character is the most unlikable protagonist I have ever come across. I couldn't even get halfway through. The first chapter was all info dumping. Literally just describing the kingdoms and the world. By the 5th chapter there was no semblance of a plot other than ""wow this mysterious guy is hot"" to make me want to keep reading. I regularly came across sentaces that made absolutly no sense, or the author would use modern slang/ phrases that was totally out of place for the time period. The rules of ""gracelings"" made absolutly no sense.
