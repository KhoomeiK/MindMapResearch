Not to mention, many pagan religions such as Ancient Greek religion have female godsend especially creators and progenitors are seen as female (Gaia, Atea, Nuwa, etc), so there‚Äôs an argument that god being a man is actually the new thing and was probably created as a control mythos.

You can handle a baby for a short period without a problem. 

That said, you should only do so in emergency situations. Moving wildlife socializes them toward humans, it can injure you and/or the animal, and you could be moving it to a less safe area by mistake. Deer, birds, and other woodland creatures all care for their young differently, and what a human might anthropomorphize as ‚Äúthis fawn is on its own omg the mother is deAd!‚Äù Might be the mother just doing her normal 6-8 hours of foraging and leaving baby where he can be retrieved later.

MurderedByWords,fqhj34s,t1_fqhegu5,1589378011.0,"Not many. Just a few. But our second amendment rights here in theory SHOULD be used during peaceful protest, if we‚Äôre going to exercise them as they were intended. 

2A was created so that people had some form of equalization over their government. So that our dissent was backed with an ‚Äúor else‚Äù. And given that these chucklefucks were allowed to march on Washington and into state buildings with AR‚Äôs with very few to no arrests, I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs working as intended. It‚Äôs a part of our rights as Americans to bear arms while protesting and if the government sees that as threatening and is too scared to stop the protest, good, that‚Äôs the point. Now. I wish people wouldn‚Äôt protest against normal public health measures and sound logic, but it‚Äôs still their right to do so, and they‚Äôre doing it in the same way I would support BLM, women‚Äôs rights groups, any civil rights group protesting. 

I‚Äôd like to see more armed protests tbh. Can you imagine if every woman at the women‚Äôs marches was also packing? If every queer person was armed, would people be as keen on kicking our heads in in bathrooms at pride?"
NatureIsFuckingLit,fqh8pdw,t1_fqh687d,1589371187.0,"Ding dong, you‚Äôre wrong. Hunting and fishing sports fund a third of our nations wildlife and parks departments budgets. Hunters are often huge into conservation, because if native species end up being endangered, they get restricted from hunting. They call in tagged species they find to help population trackers get accurate data, abhor and will readily report poachers and illegal hunters who give them a bad name and put more restrictions on their practices, and adhere to guidelines set forth by national wildlife authorities in order to protect the species they are hunting from destabilization. Even big game hunters inadvertently (or not) fund a huge part of foreign wildlife conservation. An organized big fame hunt can cost tens of thousands of dollars, and a large portion of that goes to sanctuaries and preserves.



Reducing the impact of invasive species is one of the best ways to ensure native species thrive. Boats are aggressive, overpopulous and dangerous to both us and the environments they live in. They don‚Äôt have natural predators, as even most large carnivores would prefer not to fuck with something that will shatter its own teeth against a rock to make them sharper when cornered, and we‚Äôve already seen above why their breeding habits are problematic.

None of this is to say we don‚Äôt have a huge hand in WHY these species have become invasive or endangered. Elephants wouldn‚Äôt need to be funded through the deaths of other elephants if we hadn‚Äôt poached them to near extinction. Boar would probably have a larger space to roam on if we hadn‚Äôt pushed their environments into the sidelines for farming and development. 

But none of that is the fault of ethical hunters who do a ton for conservation every year, and are trying just like every other conscientious citizen to preserve what balance we can.
