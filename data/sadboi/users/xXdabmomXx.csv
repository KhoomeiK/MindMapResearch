Marriage,fdo5k4h,t3_em49r2,1578599277.0,"Do not buy a house right now. Wait until you’re good. And for the record, kissing is cheating. I don’t know your man, or what kind of person he is. It could be one of two things. A.) He’s an ass and doesn’t give a fuck about your feelings. Or B.) He is unhappy. Or maybe he is fighting his own demons. Is he depressed? Either way, it’s no excuse to cheat. Talk to him, lay it ALL out. I would even consider marriage counseling. My husband and I have done this, and it helped us tremendously. I hated the thought of my family being split up. It hurts. But at the same time, don’t stay with him just for the kids. 
And if you do end up going to counseling, and things don’t improve even after you’ve told him how you felt, then it’s time for you to move on to bigger and better things. Your kids need a healthy home ❤️"
