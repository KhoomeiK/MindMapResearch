Ask him to make you fruit salad and egg whites. Print out some healthy recipes that you “want to try” and offer those to him too. Just communicating will help. You can be honest and say “dad I LOVE you’re doing this and we are spending this time together!” And also let him know these heavy breakfasts everyday are too much as gently as possible. I know everyone is finding an outlet and struggling in their own ways. Giving him the outlet and asking him to modify the recipes isn’t going to hurt him. Let us know how it goes!

What a beautiful slap in his face to get to tell him that those viewers love you so much they are paying your legal fees.
