Iâ€™ve been feeling better for over a week now but the psychosis lasted more than a week and was terrifying. I decided to stop doing weed and edibles but still drink. Iâ€™m a little worried that I might have another experience of psychosis if I drink tho :(

Problem: BAD PERFORMANCE AFTER UPDATE

Hey guys so Iâ€™ve been playing battlefront 2 on pc for awhile now and everything grabs been running smoothly up the Age of Rebellion Update. My pc hardware is currently running a GTX 2080 ti and Ryzen 7 1700x. The game has run smoothly on ultra setting with locked 60-75 FPS. Is this just me or is anyone else having issues especially on co-op?"
