depression,eyktqrt,t3_cx1nlm,1567167789.0,"If the stress is your problem (or one of them) i would recomend you 1. watching ASMR videos. If you don't know what it is, these are calming videos on youtube, they can help you in many many ways. If you don't know much about ASMR world (or know, but just curious) i would love to recomend you some videos and ASMR-artists!! 2. Meditation - there is an app called 'headspace' and it's the greatest. It can only take 3 minutes, you can maditate anytime you want, where you want, how you want. 

Few months ago i was in a very bad place when it comes to stress (i would literally throw up and shake) and these methods really helped me. I hope you'll find your peace, i hope your situation will get better and all your problems will get solved. Lots of love!"

Don't do it now, remember that you can always do it later. Just wait to see what will happen next in your life, even from dumb curiosity. You're 19. You have so much time to figure out everything. 
I really, truly, with all my heart hope that you'll be better. 
If you would ever want to talk, write to me. I know that it won't help with debt and money problems, but sometimes a good talk is really helpful. Kisses."
