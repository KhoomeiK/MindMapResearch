She stated she expected me to pay for all dates, even if she planned them, and the times she offered to pay for something it was merely an empty gesture and I wasn’t supposed to let her. She stated she felt like she was “wearing the pants” when she paid for anything. I stated we had different expectations and suggested we try to meet somewhere in the middle, as we’re both grown with responsibilities and jobs. She then told me she’s “got options,” a new development in the conversation, so I let her decide she should pursue them. She expected me to fight for her but as soon as she talked about her “options” I considered it being dumped and I shut down further talk. I’m upset for such a stupid topic (a tiny amount of money) to escalate to our breaking up. I knew she was quirky but she showed me a lot of wacky ideas while she was trying to state her case.

Even loneliness is a symptom, not the primary condition. For me, [I believe] the primary condition is poor social skills. This could be chalked up to a thousand or more contributing factors.
