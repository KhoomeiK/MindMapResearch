Making people believe that the wicked will be punished after death just ensures that they don't take matters into their own hands. It allows powerful people to do what they want and hide behind religion to prevent people from rebelling. 

Furthermore, religion has been used to control and manipulate people to do the deeds of these powerful people as to ensure that they take none of the blame. I mean look at the devastation occuring in the middle-east, from birth children are taught to hate the western world and are forced into Islam. Then once they have consumed everything that Islam has to offer, they are brain-washed to literally sacrifice their lives and harm others in the name of their god (Allah). However it's all bullshit, the teachings of Islam is just being warped to make people do terrible and traumatic things."
AskReddit,ffuog9m,t3_ev5zdg,1580246225.0,"Was 6 years ago, my sister and I got into a fight and at the time I had anger issues due to personal reasons, depression and shit I was going through at the time. I was at a point where I bottled up so much of my feelings and emotions that I became distressed, violent and constantly on edge. 
Long story short, my sister provoked me by saying mean things about the bad stuff I went through, my depression, my failures and the flaws in my appearance. I got very angry, we got in a physical fight and because I was older and stronger, I ended up hurting her, more than I wanted to. She called my dad crying about it, parents rushed home and she told them a story where I started it all and that I was the one to blame. 

Parents got angry at my, especially my dad who screamed at my face and attacked me (but this wasn't when I cried, I was used to that kind of shit). But my mum stopped him and took me aside because she realised something was off. She asked me what was wrong and I just burst out crying. All the emotions that I had bottled up just leaked into tears. She hugged me the whole time until I calmed down and I told her my side of the story. In the end, both my sister and I got a scolding for it."

People normally their feel sorry for themselves and do nothing or decide that they're not gonna have it and make changes that will benefit their situation and future. And you've chosen the latter, so for that I'm proud. Keep up the good work, and also don't be bummed out if you had day's where you weren't in the mood and did nothing. Days like those occur because your body and mind needs time to relax (especially if you've been stressed). 

Oh and btw, I understood your message perfectly. Keep up the good work and I hope you do start feeling better."
AnxietyDepression,fcy1g1i,t3_ejggtc,1578073368.0,"I'm sorry you're going through that, I know what it's like so I sympathise. 

I too have had feelings as I described as being empty inside, walking around like a soulless host. Going out with friends ans having a laugh but as soon as I get home, I'm blank. As if I sub-consiously created a mask for everyone around me to see so that they don't see the real me.

One thing that I did was write my feelings down on a notebook. I know this seems clique but it does help. It helps you vent and that's important because it prevents all of it from building up and I don't know about you but I bottle my feelings up to the point where I become aggressive and just horrible towards myself. Like I would harm myself and hate myself for being the way that I am.
When you write your feelings down, don't think about whether it makes sense or not. Just start writing. It helps you actually think about yourself and establish exactly what you are feeling or thinking. Personally, I write my feelings down as a poem, but most of the time it doesn't have a proper rhyme scheme. And that's the point it doesn't have to. Give it a go, maybe it'll help you.

Second thing I'll mention is the long term of this depressive state that you are in. You will never know when you're going to not feel depressed or be ""cured"". Maybe it'll take years, who knows. But first thing that you need to do is love yourself and accept who you are, your flaws and your perfections. I mean, you wouldn't be harsh on your friend if they were talking shit about themselves, so why do the same to yourself. 
What has helped me is that I've focused more on my goals. I started working out and was determined to lose weight, I started to actually focus more on my studies because one of my goals involve my career (who's doesn't). And it could be anything, learning a language, an instrument, a sport, martial arts etc etc. 
If you don't know your goals and what you want to do in your future, work on that first. But don't get too stuck up with it, it could literally be anything that intrigues you. 
Because being conscious of this progression where you become a better version of yourself, helps boost your confidence which further helps you love yourself more. Ultimately, helping you slowly feel less depressed each day. Again, you can't determine how long it will take to get rid of this depression. But the tips I've given you can help. 

I wish you all the best and if you need to vent some more, we'll be here for you. You're not alone."

I wish I could stay in my bed and sleep forever, but I cant, more like I will not let myself sercum to that feeling of surrender. There is so much I want to do in my life, I know it will be difficult to achieve them and it will take a lot of time and effort. But I'd rather go through that struggle than give up on everything. Because I know that once I do, I will regret it. 

Imagine in 20 years time, you think back on all the opportunities you had to walk the path towards achieving your goals, and knowing that you didn't and wasted 20 years of your life. Think how regretful and hopeless you would feel if you were in that situation. I don't want to end up like that, and neither would you l, or anyone. 

So however much you grieve and suffer from making an effort and trying to shape your future, know that it is a better path in the long run. One day you will think back and agree that all that pain was worth it, because at that point you will be happy with what you have achieved. And it doesn't have to be every goal you ever made, even if it's some or even one, you would still be proud of yourself and so would the people who care about you. Also, knowing that you have made achievements, it would motivate you to try and achieve your other goals.

You may think I'm bring too optimistic, but it's that optimism that carries you throughout your life, without it, you are more like to sucum to giving up. 

I hope this has helped you in some way, I wish you all the best. Merry Christmas and  have a happy new year, 2020 is a fresh start, anything could happen as long as you're will to put in the effort."

Everyone is different and everyone learns at their own speed. Just because your best wasn't enough to lets say, pass an exam or nail an interview, doesn't mean there's anything wrong with you. Life isn't about the wins and successes, in fact when you think about it, it's your failures that stick with you in life. You can remember every moment in your life where you've failed; how it made you feel; your thoughts; your actions. But don't see failure as a bad thing, because it isn't. It's a great opportunity to learn from your failures, to learn what to do, what not to do, what you need improving and even what extra skills you need. Because here's the great thing about failing, if you learn from your mistakes, whatever the failure is, you will not make that same mistake again. That my friend, is called experience. And experience is precious and essential to becoming a better version of yourself. 

So keep going. Never give up. Suceed, fail and fail so more. Just make sure to learn from your mistakes. 

Because here's the thing, if you give up, you don't end up anywhere, you stop at where you are since you prevent yourself from moving. You must move forward with everyone and everything else, because life naturally moves forward whether you like it or not. It's just, are you willing to let yourself move forward towards your ambitions or not. Because that's what life is, life has no meaning but we give it meaning. we create goals and plans for our future and they carry us through every frustation, anger, loss and guilt. Also, along with this, the love we naturally share amongst ourselves give our lives value. Friends, family, communities - these are the things that can make us happy (at least temporal happiness). And let me tell ya, the ones who truly care for you, value your life more than anything. So please don't give up, keep trying, keep moving forward and follow life.

I hope this has helped you. I wish you all the best."

AnxietyDepression,f9pqxeg,t3_e6de4g,1575546479.0,"Keep you goals and ambitions in mind. School is never a stress-free environment and considering this and your situation, you've made it this far, that's impressive.

Now stop for a second and ask yourself:

What do you wanna do after graduation? 
What are you interested in? 
What do you want to study? 
What is your overall ambition/goal?
Where do you see yourself in a few years? 

Use the answers to these questions as motivation to get you through these last months till April. Let your interests and goals drive you to a successful graduation.

Although I warn you, don't overthink it, don't let these questions overwhelm you. Achieving these big plans and goals that people make for themselves take a lot of time to achieve and you can't just simplify a life long plan into a single thought or note you've written on a piece of paper. 

Take things one step at a time, for you right now it's graduating. 

Now for your anxiety, I can't say much because I too syffer from anxiety (but mine is social anxiety) and OCD. I would say, just see how you feel after graduation because if school is the cause, then maybe when you leave you become less anxious. 

Finally, for you depression, I know how difficult it can be. If you too have depressive thoughts and feelings that causes you to procrastinate which then makes you even more depressed, that each productive activity as a win. This includes things like cleaning your room, revising for an hour, cooking, showering, doing dishes, taking dogs out (if you have pets - don't just take the neighbour's dog and walk it 😂) and so on.
Treat each task as an achievement because it really is, we don't think about it a lot because it seems like a normal routined thing that we must do, and if you don't, you're seen as unorganised. But fuck that, each daily task that I mentioned above is an achieve, be proud of your achievement.

Anyways, hope I helped you in some way. I wish you all the best. Stay strong."

Only then do I smoke because I can just lay back and actually relax, detox from all the stress I got on that week. 

You need to get your priorities straight, weed does not come first before all your real world activities. If it does, it means you're addicted. Yes, you can definitely get addicted to weed and it is not ok for people to represent weed as a risk free, non-addictive drug.

AnxietyDepression,f8y85y9,t3_e2tigr,1574942801.0,"Hi there. First off I'm so sorry you're going through all of this trauma and depression, it definitely sucks. I know what you mean when it comes to the desensitization, I haven't cried in a long time (5+ years) and many times I have wanted to. Crying is the best way to get things off your chest but I never did, because of this, I bottled up all my feelings and trauma leading me to becoming more agressive and violent. 

I've dealt with my anger but it was very difficult, it was the weight of everything that just crushed me under my own weight and turned me into some monster I didn't want to be. 

Now I don't know how to help you with the crying, however you must get all your feelings off your chest. The thing that helped me was that I talked about it to someone. Not just anyone though, nor a therapist, I talked to someone I trusted the most, my closest friend. Now I can't assume you have someone like this but my friend (who I see as a brother and vise versa) is understanding, not judgemental, supportive and was always willing to talk whenever I asked. Legit, I would message him, can we meet up and talk?, and he would be there even if it was late at night. 
If you have someone like this, someone who's willing to share the burden with you, who's will to carry that weight in your chest, then you should consider talking to them whenever you're feeling down, or want to cry, or are having bad thoughts. If they really want to help, they'll be there for you.

If you don't have someone like this, then you just met one. Whenever you want to talk, we're here for you. If you want to talk to someone directly, we could talk if you'd like to (on discord or something). Just know that you're not alone in all of this. 

Stay strong. I wish you all the best."

Waited by a bus stop with my mate so that he can get on the bus towards his house, when he left I knocked out on the bench I was sitting on (which was 5 minutes away from my house). I wake up to my mate, who ran back realising I knocked out, trying to get me up. The rest was kind of a blur but my mate basically carried me back home and into my room. I had alcohol poisoning and a really bad fever and had to recover for the rest of the weekend. The worst weekend ever. I was really embarrassed."

AnxietyDepression,f8ebtao,t3_e0jbo2,1574524344.0,"Yeah I know what you mean. I have anxiety as well and I don't think any one understands apart from those who are in the same situation as us. 
But honestly there is nothing I can say that you haven't heard before. I can go on about pushing yourself and getting out of your ""comfort zone"" to converse with people, but it's never that simple. 
So don't do it. Don't push yourself. Only when you really want to socialise with others, only then should you try to push yourself and get out of that comfort zone. Fuck what anyone says, if you don't want to socialise then don't. I mean I keep myself well accompanied so I don't really need to socialise nor do I want to. 

Don't do something just because others say so, this is what I hate about society. Everyone pressures you to talk and all that pressure just gives you a bad time - anxiety attack, panic attack, elevated heart rate, nervousness and increased fear of socialising. Fuck them all. 

Like I said before, try socialising with others only when you want to put in the effort, only when you really want to talk to people. You can never pressure someone to do something they don't want to do.

I wish you all the best."
AnxietyDepression,f8eak7s,t3_e0e4uk,1574523395.0,"The first of many steps to come. I know what it's like to be unproductive due to depression, so when I say I am proud of you, know that I really mean it. 

Although I can't really relate with having a untidy room because even though I've been severly depressed, I've always had OCD so I was very tidy. But I did stay in my clean room all day, every day doing nothing (well more like watch yt videos or netflix on my phone in bed all day). 

Anyways, keep up the good work and take this as a victory because it really is. Like I said at the start, this is the first of many steps, many victories. I wish you all the best."
