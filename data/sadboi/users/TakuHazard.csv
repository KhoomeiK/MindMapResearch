simonfraser,fqe22ky,t1_fqdz8ob,1589300484.0,Hey. I chickened out and dropped cmpt 300 and just did 295. On discord I think some people persevered. Harrinder keeps saying that ideally you should have cmpt 295 as a pre-req. Although if there is a time to a risk it might be this semester because of the new assignment heavy grading scheme. Or alternatively you could just drop in for lectures this semester and officially take it next semester.

It would be much harsher doing what you are suggesting and claim that Sarri is better than Wenger, Mourinho and Ancelotti. I don't see how that section would be controversial.

  You are also kidding if you would put Sarri's resume over Enrique's. 

The last section are managers that are probably more comparable to Sarri. You could argue one way or another. The outcome of those debates doesn't really matter as we already have our 10 and I can name at least 2 managers in that section that are either better or just as good (Poch, Tuchel, Rodgers). Those are Sarri's peers in terms of accomplishment, i.e. relatively young managers (in terms of experience at the top) with radical systems that haven't really produced much.

Also I don't agree that Poch was in the same boat as Sarri because the Serie A hasn't been that competitive for a long time due to Juve's dominance. Regardless they have achieved about the same level of success."

Mourinho, Ancelotti, Wenger, Enrique.

Coaches of about the same stature.

Rodgers, Ten Hag, Tuchel, Nagelsmann, Inzhagi, Emery, Rafa, Poch, Valverde

I've been advocating in the School that CMPT 295 should be a requirement for CMPT 300. It currently isn't a pre-requisite due to program-level structural oddities that have little to do with the content of the courses. Seeing the low-level details of computer systems in 295 is helpful for 300.  
While you are free to take both courses simultaneously (which is better than taking them completely out of order), my opinion is that you'll get more from both courses if they're taken in the order of 295 then 300.

movies,fb8csh1,t1_fb3pvcl,1576611111.0,Agreed. The whole second part of the movie with Fran was a bit weak. She should have been long dead by the time Martha found her.
movies,faxw8tx,t1_faxunt8,1576390968.0,"I still don't think it makes sense for several reasons.

1. No-one knew that Harlan had been possibly killed by an overdose for the simple reason that the toxicology results (ignoring for a second here that they would have come clean) had been burned and Ransom had already burnt the hospital . So even if they found Fran's body and find out she had died of an overdose I don't think they could have possibly linked Martha to her. 
2. I agree hiding the body would have been difficult but even for a second if we believe that Ransom planned on implicating Martha with her murder the logistics require a big leap of faith and honestly kinda felt inconsistent with the rest of his brilliant plan. 
3. What saved Martha was that the detective couldn't understand who had hired him because that someone was obviously privvy to something big and their motivations were at the centre of the whole movie. That fact, in addition to an anonymous call placing Martha with Fran's dead body that couldn't have framed her and probably outed him. Hence why I think that whole scheme doesn't make sense.

I am willing to concede that maybe he did want to frame Martha but I still think that poetic angle is a bit of a loop-hole. Enjoyed the movie though."
movies,faxubnu,t1_faxu0zp,1576389946.0,Again I don't understand the framing angle as Ransom could have not possible forseen the police being around when Martha found Fran. And again he wasn't banking on her calling the ambulance too so how would the framing work ? She could have easily gotten rid of that body herself to begin with if she had found Fran dead.
movies,faxtsac,t1_faxte3o,1576389668.0,I mean if I ignore the timing issue it still doesn't make sense seeing as he was banking on the car chase not happening and on Martha leaving Fran for dead. I don't see how that would frame her at all. Heck he could have just taken her body away and played the blackmailing bit himself.
movies,faxotv9,t3_e21a17,1576387202.0,"I mean I get poetic licence to make the plot work but why in the hell would Ransom inject Fran with an overdose of morphine instead of a more tried and tested strategy of like shooting her or stabbing her.

She should have been dead for quite a bit by then."
