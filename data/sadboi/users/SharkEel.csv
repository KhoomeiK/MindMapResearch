>This says that the acceleration due to gravity is independent of the mass of the object

If the mass doesn't matter, neither does the weight.
If the weight really did affect the acceleration due to gravity, then the hammer and feather experiment would have had a different result. It didn't. It experimentally proves weight doesn't matter.

Go ahead and explain why they fall at the same rate in a vacuum? Do you think the moon doesnt have gravity?

Here is some more:
>Mass does not affect the acceleration due to gravity in any measurable way. The two quantities are independent of one another. Light objects accelerate more slowly than heavy objects only when forces other than gravity are also at work. When this happens, an object may be falling, but it is not in free fall. Free fall occurs whenever an object is acted upon by gravity alone.

https://physics.info/falling/"
theworldisflat,fm3cinh,t1_fm09bcw,1585719039.0,"Let me just copy paste an answer to you because i am incredulous you don't know about the hammer and feather experiment being somebody who believes in space and the idea we went to the moon:

-----

From Newtons law of Universal Gravity we know that the force of gravity for two masses is F=(GMm)/r2 where G is the Gravitational Constant and r is the distance between the masses. We also know from Newtons Second law of Motion that the net force acting on an object is related to the product of its mass and the acceleration of the mass F=ma.

Let M be the mass of the moon and m be the mass of the feather. If we set that two equations above equal we get:

GMm/r2 = ma
GM/r2 = a

This says that the acceleration due to gravity is independent of the mass of the object. On the moon there is no air resistance so both your hammer and feather experience the same amount of acceleration and hit the ground at the same time.

---------

Acceleration has nothing to do with weight. It only has to do with g, and air resistance.
