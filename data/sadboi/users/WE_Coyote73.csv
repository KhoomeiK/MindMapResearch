I had literally just walked around the corner of my apt building heading towards my apt door when I noticed a lady with a rather large briefcase walking away from my door.  I thought it odd, obviously, but I continued to my door and as I reached it the lady turned around, came up to me and asked if I was The Coyote, I said I was and she asked if she could speak with me inside, ok now I'm buggin out a little, I hesitantly said ""ok"" and we stepped into my living room and sat down.  

The lady says ""My name is Dr. So and So and I'm from the County Dept of Health.  I'm here because you had a recent sexual encounter with someone who tested positive for HIV and he gave us your name as a contact.""  

I nearly pissed myself.  

The doctor was very sweet and kind though, she said that if I wanted she could collect a blood sample there and then for testing, which I had readily agreed too.  Unlike you I was a bit of a top whore who barebacked frequently and it wasn't my first HIV scare (in all I know of at least 8 partners who were positive but due to my predilection for raw fucking I'm sure I was exposed more then that).  I've never come up positive.  Don't ask me how as I have no earthly idea.   

So, what's the point of my story?  First off, coulda been worse, some lady could've been stalking your apt instead of calling you and second, one exposure doesn't mean automatic infection.   So take a deep breath and don't panic!!  

BTW, just a side note to my story.  The doctor scared the shit out of me when after she took my blood she asked me how my dissertation was coming along (I never mentioned I was in school, let alone that I was a doctoral student).  I asked her how she knew that as I didn't mention it and she said ""well, the gentleman who gave us your name didn't remember your address or phone number just that you were a graduate student, in fact that's how I found you. I checked the university records and was able to get your information.""  I asked how she had access to my university records as that information is supposed to be private and she said ""well, we're the health dept, we have access to anything that will help us track down a person that's been exposed to an infectious disease.""  

I was NOT pleased by this revelation."

The town government is rife with corruption, property taxes are quite high (like the rest of NJ).  As for crime, it depends on what part you live in but even then some streets might be fine but one street over is horrible.  We have several murders a year here (usually drug or gang related, I can't recall any innocent people being targeted).  

Drugs are a problem in the community and there is a small gang presence but they mostly keep it over in RIttenhouse Park where they have infested the houses over there.   

We lack any sort of real stores around here, mostly dollar stores, asian owned convenience stores,  the sorts of places you'd find in a ghetto neighborhood.  We do have one Acme supermarket on the edge of town that is nice albeit a little expensive.  

This isn't the kind of town where you can keep your windows or doors unlocked.  Unfortunately the extent of crime in town is not really known since the police work actively to keep crimes from being reported, they do this because of WIllingboro's long reputation and they (meaning town council) are trying to lure people in.  

I cannot recommend anyone moving here, especially someone coming from a middle/high income area.  As others have said, if you want to move to this area look in Delran, Moorestown or Mt Laural instead, you'll be a lot happier with your choice.

If people are wondering why I'm still here.  Well, I actually left and lived elsewhere for 13 years before my brother asked me to come back and help him.

Now, let me preface this by saying I, in no way, agree with these people however I do understand why they are angry.  

When people like you and me look at the various disease suppressing policies what we see is good public health policy that is designed to protect the most vulnerable and our health care infrastructure.  What these people see is government slowly infringing on some of our fundamental freedoms with the end game being that these policies will either create precedent that allows government to suppress fundamental freedoms at their whim OR that these policies will become permanent in some form.   Both of these scenarios are completely realistic and COULD play out.  It's already happened with the Megan Law registry (some states have other registries now that are completely unrelated to sex offenders) and it can also be seen with how law enforcement has slowly introduced cameras in public places, getting citizens used to their presence by using the excuse that the cameras are being used to deter or monitor for crimes, which they were in the beginning but now gov't uses those cameras for other purposes.

Once the emergency passes, and if you have an outstanding debt, they'll set you up on a repayment plan to get you caught up.  I know that is what PSEG is doing as well as my local waterworks."

newjersey,fnbnyx7,t1_fn7cji2,1586818949.0,"I stick to the forecasts from the NWS.  News channels, imo, have an agenda to make shit sound worse then it is to make sure people tune in to their channel to watch for updates.  The NWS doesn't have any agenda except to report the facts as they are, they don't need to drive viewership for ratings like news channels do."
newjersey,fnbn9yi,t1_fn909b9,1586818579.0,There was a story shortly after the Spring Break fiasco happened where a father refused to let his son (who went to Fl for the break) back into the family home.  Kid had to quarantine somewhere else before he was allowed back in the house.
newjersey,fnbmuac,t1_fnaundr,1586818356.0,"Agreed.  I always thought it was supremely stupid that businesses put those lame canopies over the pumps.  If you want to do it, fine, but at least build it to last."
newjersey,fnbmcoz,t1_fnaayi8,1586818104.0,"Born and raised in NJ but lived for many years in Texas and had a few brushes with tornadoes.  As the other guy said, if you get the Warning, go to your basement and get under the stairway or if you have a bathroom or laundry room down there, go in there.   

If you don't have a basement then go to the most interior room of your house (closets count), you want to put as many walls between you and the tornado as possible.  It isn't the tornado that kills you but rather all the debris it throws around at the speed of a missile. 

If you don't have an interior room that you can hunker down in and you can hear or see the tornado then get in your bathtub and cover yourself with your bed mattress (people have survived direct hits from a twister by doing this). 

Finally, the most important thing:  PROTECT YOUR HEAD!!"

This reminded me of a recording of ""Sunday Bloody Sunday"" by U2, in the middle of the song Bono is ranting about the violence and then he turns on Americans by saying, and I'm somewhat paraphrasing, ""I've had enough of Irish Americans who haven't been back to their country in twenty or thirty years come up to me and talk about the resistance, the revolution back home, fuck the revolution."""
