TMI incoming: I have a dog at home who decided to eat a beard comb a few months ago and I have been fighting pancreatitis with her, along with the bills that come with it (in the thousands of dollars now). 

Coupled with less hours at work due to no jobs coming in (welding for oil and gas industry), so I am getting reduced pay with grocery prices rising.

Everyone coming together and helping even when they are not asked or ordered to ensure the safety and well being of their neighbors but this has not happened.

Black Flag and III were the last AC's I finished because of my personal interest in the time periods they were set in, rather than them being a true AC game i.e. II and Brotherhood. Not to mention even after I finished them I put an untold amount of hours into the MP player portions of them since Brotherhood. I maybe a minority in this but they made a mistake ditching that, it was so refreshing in a land of FPS's.

Valhalla will probably be the same even if they stray from the roots of the series the Viking setting and mythology will be enough to keep me interested long enough to complete it. But I do hold out hope that eventually we will get the full AC game set in Japan and a triumphant return to 90% stealth and 10% action based combat.

Squirrels are different. She knocked a small one off the fence one time and got it in her mouth and proceeded to whine. She whines when she is excited but never barks except for doorbell, door knocks, or the leafe blower.

I got my fingers in between her teeth and forced / or she let me open her mouth something I do a lot when she grabs my socks while I am getting dressed and she let the squirrel go.

In my opinion they can say things are open are closed all they want and it's my right to not go places that reopen. The people I truly feel for are ones that will be ""forced"" back to work under far from ideal circumstances. And the places where people normally congregate that people like me will refuse to go to until I feel comfortable and not when I am told to feel comfortable. While they will get some business it will not be like it was before.

So I am strapping in for grocery deliveries/curbside pickup, using the drive through pharmacy, wiping everything with alcohol before it gets put away, and home haircuts (luckily I shave my head) until their is a better chance of me with ex-smoker lungs surviving it.

According to the city website they are outdoor activities and therefore deemed safe. Nothing was mentioned about the people gathered in the club houses before and after.

Also since it's a small town I can guarantee you that the people who made those decisions are either donors to or the people in charge of said decision."
CoronaVirusTX,fm4y792,t1_fm4uyhu,1585762920.0,"That last part hit home for me. I had to make a quick stop on the way home from work yesterday and was overly cautious to stay 6ft or more from people. Yet the other people there were walking within inches of me when they had plenty of room to spare.

I forget where I saw it but it was a tweet to the effect that ""The scariest part of this whole pandemic is that my survival relies of the common sense of others...."" More of less that's how I feel."
CoronaVirusTX,fm4tdj1,t1_fm4s2vu,1585760449.0,"I agree wholeheartedly our government should be doing more to help but in the absence of that we have to do the best to protect ourselves. Having said that hearing that Gov. Abbott saying that it's ok to go back to church and not calling for a statewide stay at home is infuriating.

We do need them to do some things but it appears that is not going to happen here. I was encouraged though to hear that in Harris County they have starting taking down basketball goals because people were ignoring social distancing to play pick up games. And as much as I hate government getting involved in everyday life that is just the type of action we need right now. That and much, much more though I fear it's a long ways off."
CoronaVirusTX,fm4p17g,t1_fm4okug,1585758181.0,I'd hope so but something about walking into a corner store with a bandana on with our love for guns in TX just scares the shit out of me. Not to mention and by no fault of their own wearing one around some police would scare me as well.
CoronaVirusTX,fm41yme,t1_fm3gxgz,1585744392.0,"Have plenty of bandanas I use them to cover my bald head while grinding at work, but I am nervous about wearing them in public. It may protect me from the disease but it might make me a target for other ""things""."

CoronaVirusTX,fm21hus,t1_fm0hrlr,1585688898.0,"I'll take some heat with you because I agree. If you need to the government to tell you to protect yourself and your fellow citizens you're too far past gone for help.

We can see the numbers, have been told by Doctors and scientists how it spreads, yet the herd still waits complacently for orders. Our freedom that Americans boast about so regularly is to make decisions for ourselves and it's scary how people crumple in the face of an emergency and don't know how to protect themselves and others without an official order.

Should they do some things in order to make things safer of course, but in the absence of that it relies upon us to protect ourselves. And if we don't do that there is no one else to blame but the person you see in the mirror every morning."
CoronaVirusTX,fm20bhj,t1_fm1zdgn,1585688272.0,"Hey, I ordered food once. Got lukewarm cheese enchiladas and thought to myself,""If I am going to get this virus it ain't gonna be over lukewarm enchiladas.""

And I agree even with all that I am doing I still think there are gaps. But I am not waiting for someone to tell me to do it, I am doing the best I can with the limited supplies (thanks hoarders) I have. Luckily I had a few bottles of 91% alcohol I used to clean my bongs before I quit smoking out of fear of being prosecuted by our ""freedom state"".

If it weren't for them I'd have nothing to sanitize with because people bought all the lysol and clorox wipes back in February. So in essence I quit smoking weed to protect myself from our overbearing legislature here in TX and the supplies I had from it are now protecting me from something even more dangerous. Kind of ironic if you think about it."
CoronaVirusTX,fm1ww4i,t3_fsf6b7,1585686471.0,"Said it before and am going to say it again in. People should not wait for politicians to protect you and yours, you can shelter in place without having an order to do so.

Some of us have to work, I am one of those in a family owned welding business. I am wearing a mask at work all day and staying as far from everyone as possible. Every time I get home I change clothes, disinfect any surfaces I have touched, and then wash my hands and am free to go about my ""normal"" routine.

I am not eating out, only taking my dog for a walk when home, and getting groceries either delivered or curbside. All of the groceries are brought in, sat on one counter, discard bags, clean the packages, put away, and then clean the counters where they were placed.

I don't need an ""official order"" to protect myself and you shouldn't either. 

Am I overreacting possibly (I don't think so) but my desire to not be a body stacked in a refrigerator truck outweighs any of that 100 times over. Dig deep into that Texan can do attitude and protect you and yours at all costs.

As they say the scariest words to ever hear are ""I'm from the government and am here to help."""

I'm no scholar just a welder from Texas, but a good start would be to take that money from bailing out corporations and give to everyone who is truly not ""essential"" so they can stay home.

What we consider ""essential"" at this point is not in the best interest of the people but the politicians bottom line. If people weren't afraid of making next months rent or paying for food I think we would see a lot of them saying f-you I am not essential and staying home."
