We also love Bluey at our house (it's on the Disney channel, but it's an Australian show.)

On hulu, the doozers are great. The Wiggles are where it's AT for my just over 2 year old.

On netflix, puffin rock.

My criteria for shows for that young was that it was not too crazy, wild, flashy or loud. Blippi, for example, did not meet that criteria for me (it also could just be that I HATE Blippi). I also had a rule that the characters had to be kind to each other and that there were no bad guys. That's worked well for us.

AND on days when I really need to put something on because I have to get shit done and Clifford isn't cutting it, I throw on Blippi without a second thought because they know they don't usually get to watch it so it feels like a huge treat.

Also: Good luck. Be kind to yourself. We are in the middle of the biggest crisis in a generation or two. There is no aspect of life that hasn't been affected. More tv than usual is fine. Way more tv than usual is fine. We're all just trying to get by and your child will be ok."

(She was constipated, but unfortunately that didn't cure our issue, which was mostly anxiety related.)

If she's super constipated, to the point that it shows up on x-ray, they may be able to offer more than miralax.

This is a terrible reason to get married if you aren't already planning on getting married, though. 

Why does he have to start school rn? Is he feeling ""left behind"" and wants to catch up? I know that feeling, but catching up doesn't mean ""being in the same year in school as your friends,"" especially when you're coming from an abusive/neglectful home. It sounds like the order of operations for him is 1) get out of the house 2) get a job and become independent 3) figure out school.

I hope he is able to understand that - he was abused and neglected as a child. He is juuuust now no longer a child and able to escape.

I hope he moves in with you guys and takes a minute to catch his breath and get out from under his mom & sisters.

If he really wants to be in the other city, can he move to the apartment with the GF and friends and just work and not go to school? I ""dabbled"" in college and then didn't go back until I was 24.

BipolarReddit,fkjif2e,t1_fkj05nm,1584246886.0,"This. Do this. Let me help you:

I'm 40 and just got diagnosed with early periodontal disease. So, the thing you get AFTER gum disease. Here's what that means: the actual bones in my jaw have receded juuuust a tiny bit, but it's never coming back. This happened because I was shitty about flossing and I'm afraid of the dentist (even though currently I have a lovely dentist, I had an absolute asshole when I was a kid it's just hard for me to do it). I didn't go for five years. So my gums got inflamed and in order to protect itself (is how my hygienist put it) the bone receded.

To be clear, five years ago, I didn't have gum disease. It went from regular ole, ""floss more, brush your teeth,"" to fucking bone loss.

Here's what I had to do about it: on two separate visits, I had to go in and get half of my mouth completely numb so he could scratch the shit off my teeth from under my gum line. Each time it was about an half an hour of feeling like someone is trying to pry your teeth out of your head. Not fun. Do not recommend.

When I went back for my check-in, he said they looked really great & there's been a lot of healing. But again, BONE LOSS. 

Good luck. Please floss!

Editing to add: i like floss picks. I've been having success flossing while watching TV and also by doing a bedtime routine (just the words make my eyes roll back in my head, but it is helpful). I make sure I have something I enjoy in my routine. I have a fun smelling moisturizer I like, for example."

JUSTNOMIL,fh2wn8g,t3_f0vvuh,1581261891.0,"Do not let wait until the baby is here to have the conversations and set boundaries. I begged him to discuss the boundaries for years, before we even got pregnant. My husband was planning to have a talk but then waited until I was almost eight months pregnant and then his dad 1) lost his own dad to cancer and 2) almost went into diabetic shock and took weeks to recover. It suddenly wasn't the time to have a boundaries conversation.

It took two years for my husband to have the conversation after that, and, just like you, he only got through one point before his dad threw a full on tantrum  and left our house, yelling about how, ""you weren't raised like that!"" Before that conversation, I had been clearly but kindly enforcing boundaries, but he just didn't give a shit what I said. So when my husband finally (fucking FINALLY) stepped up, my FIL for the first time heard, ""this is an actual problem."" Because, again, when I said it, he didn't give a shit.

This all went down two and a half years ago. My husband still hasn't revisited the boundaries conversation. My father-in-law basically hasn't set foot in my house (he'd been coming and staying one or two weekends every 6 weeks or so). We go have breakfast or lunch with him every few months and we'll apparently pretending things are fine. Which I'm fine with, but I know my husband wishes it could be more.

This is all to say, have the fucking conversation. It doesn't have to be in person. Our therapist suggested a letter. That gives HER a chance to have her emotions privately and it lets the two of YOU get every last point you want to make out & on paper (or email) without getting shut down by her manipulative tantrum.

But have it now. Give your SO a chance to shine his spine. Don't EVER put your kids in a shitty spot - it doesn't feel good. Have a game plan in place, have all of the discussions and hash it out with SO so you both know what is going to happen when MIL or FIL do X, Y, or Z. Do it now because once the kids are here, everything is so much harder.

And fwiw, ""We stay a hotels because we're uncomfortable with the smoke in your house,"" is a very reasonable boundary. ""We don't come to your house AT ALL because we're uncomfortable with the smoke in your house,"" is also reasonable."
BipolarReddit,fgurv7d,t3_f0g3m8,1581127995.0,"I am a former political junkie and I've really had to take in much, much less news in the last few years. But here's how I struck a balance:

First, I did a total news cleanse. I literally forced myself to stop reading all news for two or three months. I just needed a break. I did not feel guilty about being uninformed. I treated it like self-care and it really worked for me. Now if I feel like I need to take another break, I just do it, no guilt, no worrying I'm not Adulting hard enough.

But when I'm not taking a break, I've still cut back, and especially on the ""infotainment.""

Unless it's a special event, I don't watch TV news, and if I am watching, I watch on PBS or CSPAN. I don't really do cable news. If I'm absolutely stuck watching something important on cable news (a hearing in front of congress, supreme court justice hearings, etc) I watch the event and then turn off the talking heads - as much as I love hearing my ""team"" talk, getting sucked into their outrage (however righteous) is bad news for me.

I do listen to NPR, but I used to just have it playing all day. Now, I listen occasionally in my car, occasionally around the house.

I listen to podcasts. I've picked ones from reputable newspapers and websites, but again, I tend to avoid the bigger networks. No MSNBC or CNN podcasts. Not even CBS or NBC. Rueters, pro-publica, Washington post, NY Times...these are the sources for news podcasts.

What's really great about the podcasts is that I can decide to listen whenever, and I can turn it off whenever I want. Also, you can usually see what the topic is. Want to know about the coronavirus but not the impeachment trial? Just search for it and pick a podcast from a reputable source.

I also read articles online, but only from a few sources, and only a could of times a day.

TLDR, my advice is give yourself the gift of not taking in any news at all, then when you do cut way back on the amount and make sure what sources you do read are newsy and not infotainment. 

Good luck! I hope you're able to find a balance!"

This one works well for us. I bought a pack of gel food coloring on amazon with 15ish colors in it. Four years later I still have well over half of it and the colors are much nicer than with the standard food coloring you can get at the grocery store."
JUSTNOMIL,ff7tze5,t1_ff7c82h,1579658315.0,"I'm jumping on this bandwagon to say that six months of regular meetings & reading some books absolutely changed my life. I never got a sponsor or worked the program - I'm not knocking those things, though. I'm just saying if the whole program seems overwhelming, find a couple of good meetings and go and listen. Stay after and talk or get coffee. Buy a book & read it. Just going was literally life changing for me. You or especially your SO might go & decide you want more, but you don't have to - just put your couple of dollars in at the meeting (after your first few times) and listen.

Also, here's how my life it different: Al-Anon taught me about my part in family systems and family dynamics. I get caught up in 95% less family drama than before and can walk myself back from the other 5% real quick these days. I know what is mine & what is not mine to handle. I know where I end & someone else begins & vice versa. These are not things I understood before my six months. These are not things my 60 year-old, non-addict, adult-child-of-an-alcoholic mother understands. I don't think she ever will and she's suffering for it. Her dad is now absolutely wonderful and has been sober for almost 35 years. She loves him. They have a great relationship. But she and both of her siblings will probably always be stuck in their alcoholic family dynamic because they can't or won't change.

Try it. He might like it. If not, you haven't lost anything."

writing,ewt2pc2,t3_cpuexc,1565739241.0,"That's an absolute bullshit comment from one of those people who's like, ""it's fine if you're gay, but can you just keep it out of my face?"" when gay people so much as hold fucking hands.

I'm straight. I'm including a gay character as one of my main characters of my current story because gay people exist in the fucking world and I think it matters that they're in fiction. That is a good enough reason to have a gay character in a story. Period.

Now, as I'm not gay, it's not a story about the emotional parts of being gay, coming out, figuring out that you're gay - that's not really my story to tell. It's not a focus of the story. The guy just happens to be gay. 

I'm so annoyed that person told said this shit to you. Ignore it and move the fuck on & know that this particular person does not gave good writing advice to offer you. That's a really important lesson. Not everyone gives good advice, even if they think they do. Even if they write well! 

Fetishizing homosexuality because the character exists in your story. I'm going to be pissed about this all night.

You go write what you need to write! I'm rooting for you!"

BipolarReddit,ewh1zcz,t3_co76a1,1565395847.0,"So...I've been taking seroquel for almost 10 years for BPD2. After that and two pregnancies & births, I'm now actively working on losing 100 pounds. Which, you know, isn't the best. But I've been doing 1500 calories a day & it's working.

But here's the thing: these have been, hands down, the best ten years of my life. Before I started taking it, I had this constant feeling that I would never be me again, and that growing older must just mean losing yourself & your brain. But since I've been on it, I've been basically totally stable. I have to do my part. I don't drink, I go to bed at a reasonable hour. But I didn't have mood issues during pregnancy or postpartum for either kid. My husband & I are honestly madly in love and very happy - none of the insane moody fights from our first two years together. And my kids have never seen me hypomanic. I'm just very level and steady. 

My doctor and I are considering stepping down the seroquel in part because of the weight gain and I'm honestly terrified of quitting. I would definitely trade the 100 lbs never coming off for the level of stability in my life right now. And if coming down causes any issues, I'll take it forever if I have to.

If the question is, ""should I prioritize my mental or physical health?"" I don't think there's just one answer. There is plenty I coulda/shoulda done before now to prevent myself from gaining 100 lbs, and you can do those things, too. You're exercising, you can calorie count, or go paleo or vegan or something else. There are preventative things you can do since you know weight gain is a likelihood. But only you can decide if your brain feels good enough to be cool with the extra weight.

Good luck! I hope you get to stay calm & focused & feeling somewhat normal. It took me about 2 years on Seroquel to feel like my true self again, but that's from first being medicated at all. I hope you get there faster, no matter what medicine you end up with."

moderatelygranolamoms,evilcgt,t1_evi4cpf,1564544619.0,"I'm going to second this hardcore. I was induced with both of my children in hospitals. First birth I had a huge birthing tub. I didn't even want an epidural. There was no gas available. I hung out in the water until it was time to push (no proper water birthing in the hospital tub, but you could stay there until you pushed). My husband got in the water with me for support. (PSA If you have a water tub, remember to pack your SO's bathing suit. You can be naked. The nurses don't want to see anyone else's business.) Don't get me wrong: it was intense, but it was amazing.

For the second baby, in a different hospital, there was no giant tub available. Unlike my first labor, I was unable to eat for multiple reasons. I was hungry. I was uncomfortable. And the gas did basically nothing. I got my husband to check & see if it was even on (he said it was DEFINITELY on). I felt like I was concentrating harder on getting the gas to work than on making it through the contactions. After zero food for 18 hours on a pitocin drip, I was weak & wanted to sleep. I got an epidural. It was great for me - I slept for three or four hours & then woke up and birthed my baby.

But. I'd trade the gas & the epidural for a big ass tub every day of the week."
