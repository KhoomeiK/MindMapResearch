Believe me I also missed to go out for a walk under the sun. But I choose to stay in for the public health. Denmark isn’t my home country, I came here for my internship. I am young, healthy, not in the high risk group. I am staying in not only for myself but also for your loved ones. I have been social distancing for more than two weeks now, working from home, only going out for grocery shopping. 

With all my good intentions, I kindly invite everyone to choose to stay at home for the greater wellbeing of the society.
