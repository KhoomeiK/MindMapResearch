When that goal went in, cue mad scenes and at the final whistle. We made our way down to the KP that night the party all across the city was insane but the KP was by far the best atmosphere  I was drunk as hell didn't get home till 4 am still in disbelief. What a night"

SquaredCircle,f5qrpqt,t3_dou4kc,1572381907.0,"This is from personal experiences. Having met both as both as a fan and as a trainee at seminars at different occasions. I agree with Cara. In the 3 times I've met Aldis not once has he been a nice person. 1st time was as a fan at a show I think it was TNA and he was a total dick. I thought okay he's just in character. But the other times were in a more professional setting one was at a martial arts convention and the other during a seminar. Same thing a total dick each time. I went to thank him for the stuff he taught us in the seminar and he totally blanked me.

Cara Noir on the other hand was extremely professional and nice both times I met him and actually made time to give us pointers and tips on character work.

Thing is with Aldis is that wrestlers 50x more successful than him (that I have met) his wife included, have been really nice. There's a way to treat people to keep them coming back and to become a fan and he taught me what not to do."

Even if I don't I will still be doing it as it gets me out of the depression and makes me socialize.
