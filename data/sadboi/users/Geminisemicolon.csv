insaneparents,fk8tidn,t3_fh4ft3,1583962623.0,She’s a horrible human being. That’s her biggest concern right now? You lost your dad!
insaneparents,fjyqykt,t3_ffi3it,1583702688.0,That’s how you make sure your kid never confides in you about anything that happens in their life.
PlusSize,fjy7c9c,t3_ffflsk,1583691290.0,Love your outfit! So cute!!! 😍
gastricsleeve,fjxoqkw,t3_fex5rv,1583679655.0,Definitely! Liquid calories are the worst!
gastricsleeve,fjxooke,t3_fex5rv,1583679613.0,"Yea, so far I’ve kept off what I lost. I’m still working on losing more weight until I get to my goal. It’s hard work but totally doable."
gastricsleeve,fjxom0o,t3_fex5rv,1583679560.0,"Looking at old pics helps me to keep my mind focused on staying on track. I don’t want to go back to how I was. I’m more conscious of what I eat now since I can’t eat a lot in one sitting. 

Everyday is a struggle because the surgery is only one part of the equation. Definitely drinking water helps because most of the time when I think I’m hungry, I’m really just dehydrated."
datingoverthirty,fjsh15x,t3_fdbhm3,1583596893.0,"Yea, I’m not “my 600-lbs life” bro. No guarantee I’ll be alive in 2 years regardless but sure I’ll slim down."
datingoverthirty,fjjnygw,t3_fdbhm3,1583405566.0,Pretty sure thin people die from heart attacks.
datingoverthirty,fji1ajh,t1_fjhod14,1583358876.0,Thanks for the wisdom. I’ll get right on that.
datingoverthirty,fjhev6a,t1_fjhebld,1583346760.0,Thanks! Still new to reddit lol
datingoverthirty,fjheptd,t3_fdbhm3,1583346678.0,"Over 30 and plus size, the odds are not in my favor

Dating at this stage in life sucks. I’m a 32(F) and I’m one of the remaining single people within my group of friends. At this point most of them are either dating someone long term, engaged, or married with kids now. I sometimes feel left out of things because most like to hangout with other couples. They’re always telling me not to worry so much, that I’ll meet the right guy. 

I’m on dating apps but I’ve been out of the dating game for awhile because I wasn’t very confident in my 20’s. Being plus size doesn’t help either because no matter the age, most guys just want a slim woman on their arm."
entitledparents,fjhd0c5,t3_fdfx4b,1583345754.0,Why do these parents just leave their kids alone like that?!!?! You have to know the kid is going to cry after being left alone for a while.
AnxietyDepression,fjgtizj,t3_fdby3v,1583335186.0,I’m right there with you. I feel like I’ve done nothing with my life while others have accomplished so much and seen so many places.
AnxietyDepression,fjgg7ha,t3_fdbssb,1583325630.0,"Yea, I understand that feeling. Sometimes it feels like people are annoyed with you because it’s the same thing over and over. But I’ve learned that your actual friends will always hear you out and be there for you. I usually promise to buy them lunch next paycheck as a thank you. It helps to mentally lighten the mood and causes a laugh. This kinda helps me open up a little better."
Anxiety,fjgepst,t3_fd7af6,1583324256.0,Yes! I get those types of panic attacks often. No one can tell because I’m able to still function while going through a full blown panic attack.
datingoverthirty,fjge4v2,t3_fdbhm3,1583323673.0,"I don’t even know how to date at this point. I recently was talking with a guy and I didn’t reply to him one day because I was busy with work. When I tried texting him the next day, no response. Completely ghosted me."
AnxietyDepression,fjgdzki,t3_fdbssb,1583323524.0,Ending it isn’t the answer. Believe me. Have you tried reaching out to a friend or family about how you’re feeling?
Christian,fjf1jfz,t3_fd47d9,1583282322.0,"What helped me with my anxiety over severe weather was praying, listening to worship music and a shot of rum. The Lord knew what I needed to get through the night."
Anxiety,fjf0nwn,t1_fjez99w,1583281793.0,Its a medical setting.  My department is young and still developing so I’m part of the beginning. There’s not a lot of structure or standards just yet. It’s all being done as we go. I’m happy they rely on me but I’m also freaking out over failing.
depression,fjeu0b2,t3_fd13hk,1583278202.0,You matter. Your life matters.
AnxietyDepression,fjektml,t3_fct968,1583273621.0,Therapy has helped me with this same feeling. I had no idea just how much I’ve been through and how it’s affected me throughout my life.
Anxiety,fjeihkv,t3_fcwhgo,1583272299.0,That’s amazing!
