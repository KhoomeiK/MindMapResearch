ptsd,fqfzsy1,t1_fpxzqab,1589334989.0,"My mom isn’t big on therapy, and thinks I can just ‘get over it’:(. I’ll try to get her to find me one that works for me after quarantine, she was already iffy on the EMDR before I tried it. Thank you so much!!!"
ptsd,fpxkxmf,t3_gfynye,1588984536.0,"Even as a school shooting survivor sometimes I forget my PTSD is valid as well. It’s hard to live a whole new life after you go through trauma:/. it’s been almost 6 months and I still don’t know how to feel and i stopped seeing a therapist as I just felt judged and awkward. (It was EMDR or something and i was uncomfortable doing it). My moms making me stop doing online school next year and I have to go back to the same school in August or whenever quarantine is over. My sister graduated so now I will be alone in the mornings, when my anxiety is at its peak. Sorry I got too detailed I guess I needed to vent. It’s rough since all my friends weren’t at school when it happened so they cannot relate so i just feel very shut out and oftentimes think my PTSD is invalid + it is worse since I’ll be forced to go to school:/"
