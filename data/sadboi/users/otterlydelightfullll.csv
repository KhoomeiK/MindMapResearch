And here we are now, 4 years later and more in love than ever. Try doing some soul searching for yourself. And as my therapist told me, focus on you because when you do, your partner will come running. Seems counterintuitive, but it worked for me then and it works for me now. Good luck OP, hugs!"

I was in a toxic relationship at the time with my gf of 2 years that I couldn‚Äôt get myself out of. It was summer and still warm out at 10PM, so my gf and I decided to go on a walk to get away from the crowd. We walked a few blocks and ended up in a cul-de-sac. The stars were especially bright so we sat down with our backs against one of the 4 cars parked at the end of the street. A few minutes later, 3 people come out from one of the houses, they came up to us and one guy said ‚Äúhey, that‚Äôs my car.‚Äù We explained how beautiful a night it was and we weren‚Äôt up to any funny business, then he held out his hand to help me up. Once he did and I could see his face, I wished I was alone because wow, this man was so attractive and I cannot explain the chemistry we instantly had. He and his friends came back to the party with us, he asked for my number and I gave it to him. I soon broke up with my gf for good and my bf and I have been together 8 years now. I firmly believe I never would‚Äôve met him if I didn‚Äôt go to that party. He got me to go back to school and I‚Äôm going to graduate with my BA in May.
