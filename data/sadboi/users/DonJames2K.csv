running,fqaok16,t3_ghqup7,1589222578.0,These new runners you're seeing are probably just there cus the gyms are closed only running like a mile a day I'm guessing however once gyms open again most of those people won't be running outside anymore

britishmilitary,fptqmjf,t1_fptjr0y,1588896298.0,Damn must have been tough I just hope basic training isn't completely changed looks like there's gonna be less people per intake wonder if there'll be any changes to the pt and other stuff like the scoff house that place is always full at scoff time
britisharmy,fptpzf2,t1_fptncaz,1588895940.0,I was supposed to go Catterick April 5th and that got cancelled ain't even heard anything about a new start date yet I'm assuming mine might be beginning of June to mid June earliest

davidgoggins,fotktbm,t1_fotk13n,1588057040.0,Yh that's what I want to do it's gonna take a few years till I'm ready for that but just gotta focus on my current training now before thinking about that
davidgoggins,fotizen,t1_fotigy8,1588055382.0,Not really sure tbh since mine would be British Army and I'm assuming yours is US Army/NAVY things are probably different
davidgoggins,foti5v8,t1_foth6fa,1588054665.0,Army infantry was supposed to start basic training beginning of April but everything's been delayed cus of the coronavirus stuff but I've been thinking a lot since last month and I want to do Paratroopers now dunno how it works but I'd probably have to ask to switch during basic or try to transfer to Para Regiment a year or 2 after I complete basic training but I don't really mind rn just want this coronavirus stuff done with so I can start basic training I've already planned what I want to do for the next few years
davidgoggins,fotgapv,t3_g9evgh,1588053078.0,"You'll get better with consistent training my advise would be download couch to 5k if you're interested before I started it which was in the middle of January I could only run about 1 mile and since then I've worked my way up to 10 mile long runs, 6-7 miles normal runs I'm also pursuing a career in the military running was my weakness when I did the assessment last year November but I've come a long way since then swimming however I don't have access to a pool and it's been about 10 years since I've swam so I'm most likely going to be a non swimmer and have to try improve on that quite a bit when I start basic training that's probably what I'm worried about the most at the moment but I'll try my best"
davidgoggins,fosj59b,t3_g966vo,1588031729.0,Interested
britisharmy,fos8tl4,t1_fos8cob,1588026067.0,Ah ok thanks for the reply
britisharmy,fos8mvv,t3_g92ade,1588025970.0,Can you tell me what types of runs you do during basic and the distances if you remember? Also what type of training did you do leading up to basic training
britisharmy,fos80z1,t1_fos6ycj,1588025647.0,Would you be able to do the AACC if you're in the infantry? Might be a stupid question but I would just like to know

davidgoggins,fo1g5d6,t1_fo1eovy,1587432569.0,Exactly this even though I want to keep training and do repetition everyday I've got a minor calf injury where I just can't risk getting worse just because I want to go train again I don't like to make excuses but sometimes it is what it is rest is just as important as training
davidgoggins,fnz9c18,t1_fnz8duj,1587389276.0,The first 10 minutes I felt hungry then the rest of the run didn't really feel it anymore until after the run was done (The run was like 47 mins) but this is only the 2nd time I ran without eating   beforehand and my run times were better than when I did can't really tell if that's the reason it improved or not since I just recently started a new training plan but this training plan is better than the one I was doing before
davidgoggins,fnz86h6,t3_g3nsi6,1587388497.0,Ran 5.7 miles on an empty stomach shit feels way different when you don't eat before running

ukdrill,fmm34vm,t3_fvzc0z,1586197906.0,The reason they ain't allowed to upload to Mixtape Madness is cuz the owner of it is from Tottenham he won't let them upload their videos there at least that's what A1 said 1 time

davidgoggins,flwsnku,t3_frdlma,1585563589.0,Nice one read this before my daily run today and thought if this guy could do it I could do it and I ran 2 more miles than I would usually run not sure how to post it here but that's another one for my cookie jar
davidgoggins,fkk05n9,t1_fkjzpu6,1584267798.0,Thanks I'll stick with the training then
davidgoggins,fkjzo4y,t3_fgj4on,1584267150.0,How'd you work your way up to 10 miles a day? 2 months ago I could only run 1 mile with a few walks in between and I felt like I was dying after that still then at the beginning of this month I've worked my way up to be able to run 3.3 miles nonstop trying to work my way up to 4 miles then 5 how did you go about it?
davidgoggins,fkjzd1r,t3_fhfhsv,1584266734.0,Best to improve 1 thing at a time I made the mistake of trying to change several things at once at the beginning of this month then it made me go back to my old habits rn I'm just focusing on 1 thing and it makes things easier
