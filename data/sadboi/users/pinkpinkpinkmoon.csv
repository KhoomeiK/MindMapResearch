CPTSD,fcx933b,t1_fcx8w0x,1578056013.0,Look up exercises to activate the vagus nerve. That might help.
CPTSD,fcx8w0x,t1_fcx8pdl,1578055815.0,"I just looked it up, I think you mean globus sensation. And yep that's what I get when I'm anxious"
CPTSD,fcx8pdl,t3_ejc4rl,1578055625.0,"Hmm I'm not sure.
For me feeling anxious feels like I'm stuck at that feeling of just before you're about to explode into crying, when you get that tight sensation in my throat.
Depression feels heavier, draining, aching. 
Depression and anxiety feels different for everybody. But I'd like to hear your explanation more, I'm not sure what a globular sensation is?"

CPTSD,fcx78ix,t1_fcx63ap,1578054070.0,"Also I can't say, I'm not a trained therapist, but you went through big traumatic events (PTSD) as well as ongoing trauma (CPTSD) but as long as the treatments are the same for both it doesn't really matter what label you use, I dunno. I'm currently reading ""the body holds the score"" and it is VERY interesting and a good read if you'd like to get to know yourself better or have a general interest in psychology."
CPTSD,fcx63ap,t3_ejdbjq,1578052770.0,"Wow, I don't know what to say, and I don't think I could give you any advice, but I want to let you know that I read all of that, and thank you for sharing. I was also thinking that this could be a film and then you said it at the end! You should think about writing a book one day? (Even just for yourself). I know it's something people do to help make sense of everything and process their trauma. You went through so much, you sound like a very strong and responsible person. You're taking all the right steps and it's so great you're going to therapy. I hope you're not too hard on yourself, and cut yourself some slack sometimes. 
Once you have processed this more, you may feel more connected with people and become closer with them. It's a great thing to share your story with other people. I know you have to be careful with who you open up to, and your therapist might be able to give you advice on that. I hope you have some caring people you can lean on, otherwise I'm sure you'll find that in the future, and your journey and strength  will inspire them."

depression,fc55vmh,t3_ee58qm,1577444791.0,"Is your mum emotionally abusive on a daily basis? Are you getting therapy, and if so have you brought this up? If not  I'd advise you look up some information about the affects that can be caused by having an emotionally abusive parent. It might give you a better understanding of a potential source of your depression, and give you some good insights/resources -if this is the case. Also look up the CPTSD Reddit page and see if anything resonates with you there. Best wishes."
