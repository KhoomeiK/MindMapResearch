mentalillness,fqry5rp,t3_gk47tt,1589594401.0,"I understand it may not seem like it right now but it is a blessing in disguise. I can only speak for myself but i resonate with your statement so i hope my thoughts offer a bit of insight. 
I never wanted to be a victim. I hated that pity look people gave me when they decided to label me ‚Äúbroken ‚Äú or in need of fixing. I hated it so much. I didnt need pity. Pity wouldn‚Äôt help me grow. I just needed someone to listen to me and hear what i was saying and just give me options on how to do things in a way that was far removed from the examples I had exhibited to me. I knew from a very young age it was all wrong and that I grew up I refused to life like that. I started cutting because my inner pain was uncontrollable. Then I cut to feel after shutting down to function for so long. It had landed me in an institution several times even though i never cut in visible places. Once my parents found out the first time and sent me away to be locked up and ‚Äúfixed‚Äù,  they just seemed to really enjoy making me someone else‚Äôs problem even if it meant completely violating my dignity. I couldnt stop though, i just wasn‚Äôt strong enough and didnt have the tools to react any other way yet. Now, a much happier, healthier well adjusted 35 year old I know there is strength in vulnerability. There is power in saying, i cant do this alone. I know that sane people know we all need someone outside of our circle to talk to sometimes and that is ok. I know objects break, not people, therefore i didnt need fixed as i was never broken. I just needed a perspective I didn‚Äôt have till i asked for it. You can do this, not because I did it but simply because you can. 
On a less ‚Äúme‚Äù note, I know you are every bit as worthy of the the happiness, health and adjustment I have today. I know you did not deserve the things that have you at this point of pain . I know you have a long and difficult ,yet necessary road ahead of you. I know that you are a Survivor. So face this now, head on , in the healthest way possible. Then bask in the amazingness of a life. So many will tell people like us we ‚Äúnever had a chance‚Äù to obtain these amazing lives, tell them you are a Survivor and not their statistic.  Then, do your best to be an example for another Human in pain one day. Speak from your heart and hope something you say resonates with them. Lastly , Tell them they can do it.  Blessed Be Dear Soul."
mentalillness,fqekd0i,t3_gi9nh4,1589308995.0,"This is very abusive and manipulative post. Stop choosing to be a victim, grow up, get the professional help you need and move on. Self deprecation is toxic and no person with any amount of self Respect would surround themselves with someone who acts like this."
TooAfraidToAsk,fqc9v6s,t3_gc0r0f,1589253206.0,"Sorry for the he news but the meds you listed are not nearly as great as you obviously believe. In my 20 years of opiate addiction i never heard of anyone asking for any of the 3 you mentioned. In reality those three are the major ones that send addicts in a rage when prescribed. Tramadol is only recently controlled and is narcotic like, not a narcotic. The other 2 are none narcotic ad well. My point being you don‚Äôt understand because you havent been on an actual narcotic much less a narcotic over a period of time. As someone who knows pain meds do not help your pain they only dull your senses. I wouldnt get started with tradition pain meds. I personally would do methodone, all the analgesic properties none of the curves or cravings. It‚Äôs been around since the 70s and works well with chronic pain. Good luck to you."

Adulting,fqc7553,t3_ghxt5r,1589251524.0,"Everyone struggles doll. I am whats called a highly functioning depressive. My depression is beyond crippling at times but i was never given the option to just give in to it or have soneone else deal with my life. I often get extremely offended ( and further depressed) when depressives who have been able to put their life and responsibilities into everyone else‚Äôs hands (mom, siblings, friends, so etc) tell me im not as bad off as them because i have an education, marriage, career, kids, friends etc. In reality i feel im worse off because i know i have ‚Äú no reason to be depressed ‚Äú but i still am. I do have ‚Äúeverything‚Äù but it‚Äôs simply because giving up or putting my responsibilities off was just never an option. I struggle daily. I often feel as if I am an actor as very few people are aware of my adversities. I dont talk about it because i dont want people to see me differently. I don‚Äôt want their pity nor do I want to be treated like a victim. I dont want people to act a certain way as if im so fibble minded ill break. So, yeah, a lot of people feel how you do. And yes, youre just not seeing it because you are a depressive and unfortunately many are taught to think people should treat them special because of a diagnosis. It‚Äôs more telling people you have it so they can work around you jnstead of you learning to be a productive part of society . It wasnt your fault before now. But now, it is on you because you know. I commend you for asking such a profound question. Many people with mental health issues now days just wave their victim card and everyone validates it. To me that‚Äôs the most unhelpful thing people can do. We are not victims we are Survivors and im proud to see a fellow depressive acting like it. Blessed be Dear Soul, you got this.
PS im 35 btw. Was in 5 in patient facilities prior to 16 for my various mental issues. Have an undergrad degree in psych. Have 0 idea what any of this is about lol."
mentalillness,fqc49pc,t3_ghvwq7,1589249808.0,"In all fairness your writing is quite difficult to comprehend. I am fairly well educated and your reply sounds as equally cryptic as your first two comments. Perhaps you are misinterpreting the people‚Äôs comments on the scam thread as they may just be trying to figure out what point youre attempting to make. As two comments and an explanation deep and i still really have no idea the point or of what distinction you are attempting to get across. People respond best to straight forward wording as it is the easiest to compute. 
You originally asked people to answer how they fought stress now you‚Äôre telling me your true motive is to make a ‚Äúdistinction‚Äù. Im sure you can see how reasonable people could find all of this a bit...challenging to decipher. 
Either way, best to you, I hope you get things settled as to be able to move on. It‚Äôs not ok for anyone to take anything from another through deception or force and I genuinely wish we had better ways of dealing with scammers. We can cure cancer but not stop scammers?! Seems ridiculous to me."
mentalillness,fqbsq0i,t3_ghkdrc,1589243178.0,"I felt all these feelings once too. 2 years later after drowning myself in drugs and self sabotage I found out my attacker victimized 2 more very young females. No matter how hard it felt at the time , it wasn‚Äôt  close to the guilt of knowing that because I walked away a 7 and 9 year old (no telling how many more) would have to live with this for their lives too. The 7 year old testified against him. Because of her strength and courage he is now behind bars where he belongs. Because of that 7 year old I got clean, started going to counseling and now tell my story so others victims can become Survivors. We cannot control what happens to us but you best believe we are the ONLY ones who control what we do with the repercussions. Only you can decide whats right for you. Sexual deviants dont stop and victims we become Survivors by taking our power back, by refusing to allow them the opportunity to hurt others and by telling our stories. It‚Äôs not easy, but it‚Äôs easier than the guilt of knowing we could have stopped them and didnt. Blessed Be Dear Soul."
mentalillness,fqbr7h0,t3_ghvwq7,1589242352.0,"Im extremely confused by this post. You talk about a scam stressing you out (which is quite a common response).  You then go to ask suggestions on how others cope, yet reply to yourself with this cryptic comment. Im trying very hard to understand your motivation and desired outcome as this is quite odd. 
Victim is a state of mind. To overcome this state of mind you must get in a Survivor mind set and take steps to regain your power. Most importantly learn from your experience and do better to protect yourself and your finances. Being stressed over a situation does not equal a mental illness. That is quite offensive to state as experiencing life‚Äôs ebbs and flows is far different than life altering clinical disorders. 
Once again, this post isn‚Äôt sitting well so I‚Äôm not quite sure how to respond but I hope something I stated can help you."
mentalillness,fpk7e0t,t1_fphmhj0,1588689421.0,"Yes, meds are trial and error but their intent is to simply give you a rest from yourself in order to work issues out through talk therapy. Most psychiatric meds are only recommended for use for 6-18 months. Therapy and mental health intervention is about giving a client the tools they need to cope and live the best life possible not to keep them on meds for the rest of their lives. If you were ‚Äúmisdiagnosed‚Äù prior how do you know you are now diagnosed ‚Äúcorrectly‚Äù? Im confused why you put it took you forever to type this because you were shaking? Its a very malingering statement but instead if judging I figured id simply ask."
rareinsults,fpk3rtn,t3_g76klx,1588687399.0,"Im sure most incels and ‚Äúnice guys‚Äù would agree with your opinion. I simply do not. However,  the reality is we respond to people based on our perceptions, thoughts, and actions not the commenters so if you‚Äôre a person who gets off on being unkind to others to make yourself feel better, well...that‚Äôs what you will see in others. Best of luck to you."

mentalillness,fofe65p,t1_fo40dm8,1587733849.0,"How did i know you first statement was going to be your reply? So predictable. To someone who is struggling with a mental issue, there is no difference in what you said/meant only how they take it. Again, one more reason why people who have not studied psych should learn to keep out of these conversations. Regardless of your verbiage you put it out there to someone struggling that isnt ok. Accept what you wrote was not ok and move on, not back talk needed. There is no need to try to try and save face when there is none to save."
mentalillness,fo2y1ka,t1_fo17owk,1587476716.0,"I believe that to be quite the stretch. Cotard Delusion suffers are incapacitated by their symptoms over a course of time. Criteria is often marked with periods of treatment, remission and relapse. Upon relapse the sufferer will withdraw claiming therapists, friends and Loved Ones are not who they claim. Liking them often to malicious figures such as a demon. This mistrust in their support system further isolates and impedes the patients ability for remission. They are extremely nihilistic as why try? They‚Äôre Dead. Often they will slow their eating habits,anorexia is very common with Cotard. They stop bathing, cease basic hygiene and quit interacting routinely . If you are dead you do not need to eat, work , maintain relationships etc. 
Although I havent evaluated the OP i am more than confident Cotard Delusion is not what‚Äôs going on here. I would highly encourage you to be very careful about throwing around terms and diagnostic terms you do not understand as this can be extremely harmful. We are educated over the course of many years as well as required by law to take so many hours of reeducation every year to maintain licensing.  Mental Health standards are changing everyday. It is not something you can keep up with in passing, learn by watching a tv show or googling something you heard once.  Please show those in mental health care the Respect and Appreciation for how hard they have worked and continue to work by not suggesting diagnosis or using words that are mental health diagnosis to describe people. Please show those with possible mental health issues the care of proper diagnosis."
mentalillness,fo2vgs3,t3_g4stwj,1587475063.0,"Being alive is quite the mind shuffle. The who, what, when , where and why if it can be overwhelming for the most well adjusted person. I not only feel like I am dead at times but genuinely believe I have died minimally 4 times in this vessel alone. The reality is, there is no one reality. There is no proven , all encompassing answer especially for those of us plagued by the heaviness of Why me, why here, what next, what before? Who‚Äôs to say it isnt all a dream? Who‚Äôs to say we are not all living our own version of the Truman show? 
It is ok to have a different perception of your current state than others. As long as it is something that at a certain point within your inner dialogue or panic you are capable of accepting you do not have the answers(nor probably ill you) No one has the answers and you‚Äôre able to recollect yourself and move on with your day I wouldnt stress over it too much. 
They‚Äôre a lot of benefits to being a seeker. You must be able to not let the thoughts become too intrusive. If this is something that negativity effect your day to day, I would encourage you to find a safe person to share it with. If it continues to be too much perhaps then you might want to talk to a professional.  Understand if you choose to share your outlook there will be people who respond adversely to you. Learn to be ok with not having the majority rule. If you see a professional I would also encourage you draw a line. No diagnosis, no medicine. I do not believe you are ill. I believe you are a seeker. It is not an easy life but it is a meaningful one. Best to you."
