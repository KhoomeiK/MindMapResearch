JordanPeterson,fqyakmd,t1_fqy7zj8,1589745482.0,"> having a serious mental disorder 

I think that you should be a bit more careful with labelling alternative or uncommon ways in which people express themselves a 'mental illness'. Just because something deviates from what we as a society consider to be 'normal' does not automatically imply that it is also an illness. We have already seen what abusing the label 'mental illness' has lead to [in the Soviet Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_abuse_of_psychiatry_in_the_Soviet_Union), wherein people were considered to be mentally ill just for not following the line of the party. So instead of just claiming that it is a mental disorder, why don't you prove it.

On your second point. It isn't up to you, me, or anyone else to say how that kid should express their identity. Have you ever tried doing this with a teenager? It's almost completely impossible to tell them what to do and wear. If they want to share their way of expressing themselves in some media outlet, let them. I haven't seen any evidence that might suggest that it is harmful to them (aside from them cringing at themselves ten years from now). I remember that emo and scene kids did the same (paraded themselves around) in my day on myspace, early YouTube, or, if they were lucky enough, on the pages of Kerrang or J-14 magazine or something. As far as I can see, the people in this thread are mostly indistiguishable from the boomers who blasted my generation for not expressing ourselves in a way acceptable to them.

> doesn’t even know what a sexual orientation is 

Genderqueer isn't a sexual orientation. It's a gender identity, and I think that almost every child knows what gender is (""boys do x, girls do y etc.)

>Every major piece of medical literature you can find will say that this  is not healthy at all for a child to be going through mentally or  physically,

Oh really? Which ones? Show us please. Because as far as I'm aware, what is harmful and unhealthy is when the gender identiy of a child is [denied by their surroundings](https://www.socialworktoday.com/news/dn_022916.shtml), *not* when it is confirmed and supported.

And by the way, you claim that it is unhealthy, but why don't you prove it. Give us some evidence. Anyone can claim something to be true, but that doesn't automatically make it true.

Edit: Maybe this kid will grow out of their identity, which often happens with teenagers, and maybe not. This really isn't up to anyone else than this kid himself, and not to us. Let teenagers express themselves however they feel most comfortable with, as long as it doesn't hurt anyone else, and especially since they are teenagers.

JordanPeterson,fpk9nni,t1_fpjvvvv,1588690649.0,"I’ll just quote an article critiquing the distinction:

> Critics argue that the preservation of negative rights requires positive rights. Some draw attention to the question of enforcement to argue that it is illogical for certain rights traditionally characterised as negative, such as the right to property or freedom from violence, to be so categorised. While rights to property and freedom from violence require that individuals refrain from fraud and theft, they can only be upheld by 'positive' actions by individuals or the state. Individuals can only defend the right to property by repelling attempted theft, while the state must make provision for a police force, or even army, which in turn must be funded through taxation. It is therefore argued that these rights, although generally considered negative by right-libertarians and classical liberals, are in fact just as 'positive' or 'economic' in nature as 'positive' rights such as the right to an education [1].

(...)

> Other critics go further to hold that any right can be made to appear either positive or negative depending on the language used to define it. For instance, the right to be free from starvation is considered 'positive' on the grounds that it implies a starving person must be provided with food through the positive action of others, but on the other hand, as James P. Sterba argues, it might just as easily be characterised as the right of the starving person not to be interfered with in taking the surplus food of others. He writes:

> What is at stake is the liberty of the poor not to be interfered with in taking from the surplus possessions of the rich what is necessary to satisfy their basic needs. Needless to say, libertarians would want to deny that the poor have this liberty. But how could they justify such a denial? As this liberty of the poor has been specified, it is not a positive right to receive something, but a negative right of non-interference [3].

Points being, the enforcement of negative rights requires positive rights, and whether or not a right can be qualified as positive or negative is largely dependent on how the right is formulated in language rather than the inherent characteristics of the right itself."

To me that just comes across as a giant contradiction. On the one hand we should espouse the idea that people cannot be reduced to their group, but are individuals first and foremost, but this still somehow leaves plenty of room for, say, racist employees to uphold a collectivist mindset which ascribes group qualities to individual people (a black man can be denied a job not because they as individuals are unsuited for it, but because he is reduced by the employer to his group identity). This is completely ludicrous. Where you to describe and uphold a true individualist society, such kinds of collectivist ideas about race wouldn't exist, and if they would, your society wouldn't be truly individualist; your ""individualist"" society would only be a weak excuse in order to facilitate collectivist ideas."

Marx en Freud doen wat alle goede filosofen doen, namelijk het introduceren van nieuwe en het bekritiseren van oude concepten zodat we in staat worden gebracht om de empirie op een andere manier te beschouwen.

Point is, I don’t think it is helpful for us to reduce them to “stains” unworthy of compassion. They aren’t always irredeemable, and the road to recovery begins when we as a society are willing to destigmatize their condition. It also simply [isn’t true](https://psychcentral.com/disorders/narcissistic-personality-disorder/treatment/) that there are no treatments, because there are."

In this individualism it is impossible to conceive that the world consists of more than yourself.

The solution to the financial backlash caused by covid19 isn’t reopening the economy, with the human toll this will cause, but by building a welfare system which supports people in times of financial distress."

psychology,fnphe3d,t3_g33pty,1587145540.0,"I really don’t like this type of thinking. It is pretty obvious that feelings and actions are often quite related. Say that I’d suddenly jump in front of you, the fright this would cause would quite obviously show in your actions (by screaming in surprise, or by jumping up). It would be ridiculous to ascribe some sort of moral responsibility to such an emotional reflex, and to say that these were actions which you chose. Sure what you’d do after the initial fright is something you can control, but your feelings and actions are at first relatively outside of your control. There is no reason to believe that other emotions function radically different. Maybe someone says something to someone else which triggers an anger response, which is consequently shown in a sort of reflex in (subtle) changes in their facial expression, tone of voice, or body posture. After this initial reflex you can of course make an adjustment to how you act, but your initial actions which were caused by the trigger cannot reasonably be ascribed to be your moral responsibility. They were reflexes, just like the fright response was a reflex. You surely are in a limited way responsible for your actions, but to say that you’re responsible for all of them all the time sets an unreasonably high standard."

On the one hand he was very outspoken about his gay sexuality both in his speech and his presentation, and on the other hand was fully supportive of very restrictive immigration in combination with a neoliberal populist politics.

MemriTVmemes,fn9ofv4,t1_fn9n2oh,1586780212.0,"Yes, some rulers were religious zealots, while others promoted religious tolerance. All I see is more evidence that Islam can be many things: a religion of war, and of peace; of zealotry, and of religious tolerance; of close minded conservatism, and of a respect for new knowledge and science. It is quite interesting that both Muslim fanatics and Western liberals are in agreement that Islam can only be the former of these things. By refusing to play the game of the fanatics and conservatives by adopting their definition of Islam, it is perhaps possible to show all those Muslims out there who are uncomfortable with this definition that there is also another way to practice their religion, based on tolerance, peace, and a respect for learning and science."
MemriTVmemes,fn9msws,t1_fn9m5ew,1586778724.0,"Islam actually largely spread through trade, tax exemptions, and the promise of a better life that converts would be able to find in Islam (particularly attractive to for example lower cast Hindus). The Ottomans and Mughals conquered and ruled over vast empires, but their conquests weren't primarily motivated by a desire to spread religion. They were conquerers first, and converters second. Almost all Islamic empires also consisted of huge numbers of religious minorities, and the Mughals in India even ruled over a majority Hindu population. It would be impossible for them to rule over their empires through pure force, for their empires would completely have fallen apart if they did due to resistance of those large groups of religious minorities."
