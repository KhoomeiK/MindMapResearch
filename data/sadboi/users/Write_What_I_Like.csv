It isn't specifically referenced, but wow does it speak to me on that level.

One Radiohead track, Waiting in the Aisle, I recall was ""donated"" to some effort raising money for mental health treatment or something. Circa 2002ish. Great song, but it was a subtle nod toward raising mental health awareness and research money."
BipolarReddit,fr5t4ai,t3_gmoa1a,1589914217.0,"At 25 mg, you don't really need to worry too much about the side effects you read about at more common dosages, which are anywhere from 150 mg to 600 mg. I personally believe they should put 25 mg of seroquel in the public water for the good of society. As a short answer, don't be nervous. It will help you sleep and without the nasty dependence that comes with benzos, like xanax. Benzos are not a long-term solution for chronic insomnia because your body adapts. There was a time when I was taking enough valium to kill a horse, and I needed that volume just to get 6 hours of sleep, because my body had adapted. It was unsustainable. 

Seroquel is different in that your body adapts to what it gets but then stops adapting. You still get the benefits of sleep and at somewhat higher doses mood stabilization but you don't get addicted. Indeed, you *can't* get addicted to seroquel. You also can't really OD on it, another reason why it's a great bipolar drug.  

The half-life on seroquel is about 6 hours, so by 9 hours after you take it, the sluggishness and hangover should be gone. Definitely after a week or two on seroquel, you'll be good to go within 20-30 minutes of waking up. Overall, 25 mg is a super small dose so I say definitely go for it fearlessly. The big side effects don't kick in for another 125 mg, at a minimum."

BipolarReddit,fr5q2cw,t3_gmsgrx,1589912746.0,"There's a lot in what you've written here that is conflicting. You say you were doing your junior year online, but also say you were living in an apartment in another state. You say you have a part time job, but you're also saying you don't have a job. You say you want to take the summer to learn about bipolar, but you also say you want to work on your portfolio. You say you're grateful for everything but you also say your home is toxic and you need to escape. I point all this out because a big part of being a balanced, healthy bipolar person is seeing your challenges and needs with 20/20 vision. The second we start fudging the truth around us to suit our desires, when we start lying to ourselves about what we need vs what we know needs to happen, when we come up with xyz reasons why things *should* happen (e.g., ""I deserve a summer to reflect""), we're letting bipolar drive the car, rather than us. A healthy bipolar person is a warrior, not a passive observer.   

Since you're newly diagnosed figuring this stuff out, I'll offer one critical tip that should be the epicenter of your path to health - no one is going to do it for you, no one owes you anything and no one will ever care about your health as much as you do. And you shouldn't expect anyone to. Arguing that you can't get a job because you need time to process your next steps on bipolar is a common thing for people like us. But I've seen bipolar people turn a temporarily reasonable idea into a series of excuses for doing nothing. And they end up saying, but it was bipolar! Well, no, bipolar was the obstacle, not the cause. This leads people to get really jaded and angry - they blame the world for their pain and failing, when in fact it was always on them to figure it out. It's not right or wrong, good or bad. It's just the ground truth of bipolar that if you don't sort out everything on your own, you'll never get there. And it's no one's responsibility except yours. 

Part of that means learning how to operate in the world while also being bipolar. That means getting a job. If you deeply feel that you just can't function right now, that's one thing. And maybe a change of environment is good. But as you say, your recent episode has passed. Now is the time not to sit in the mud and wonder what it all means. Now is the time to keep pressing forward, learning while doing. No one in this world owes you anything, and being bipolar doesn't change that. It's one of the biggest reasons why it's a debilitating disorder. ""But it's too hard right now"" isn't an excuse that will take you very far in the world. 

And I write all that with deep empathy and support. I know exactly what it is like to be 21, unbalanced, afraid and uncertain. It's a hard road you're walking. I think anyone here would agree and support you for that reason alone. Don't take my words as criticism, just brutal truth, one bipolar to another."

Expansion might not be sustainable, they might not find value in expanding/exploring beyond their local neighborhood, doing so on a galactic scale might just be unsustainable or worthless (eg  what happens on colonized planet X has no importance for colonized planet Y because they are many tens of light years apart and so communication/coordination becomes useless). Extraterrestrial intelligence might be so different from us they we don't even notice one another. They might be intentionally hiding from us (or from some other ETI that destroys other ETI). The absence of galaxy-wide colonies (or even just relics of those colonies) is not in itself suggestive that ETI doesn't exist. Indeed, the view that a galactic empire is the inevitable outcome of ETI is hugely anthropomorphic because colonization and expansion is distinctly human, if not generally a trait of Earth life.

OP, you are correct. 

I'll tell a quick story for those still reading. It was a holiday at a bar, late, there were going to be fireworks. Myself, her, her husband and many others wandered to the place of fireworks. The lights took off, people kissed, and while the booms were still thundering, she ditched him and came over to me, looking up at me with doey eyes, like enchanted. And I kept looking over her shoulder at her husband, like, ""wow, this is real. I didn't ever consider the reality."" And the guy looked so sad, so hurt. Here the fireworks are blasting, people are kissing, and his wife is looking lovingly at a guy she should not have been. My participation made that possible. 

And I'm a fucking asshole for making it possible. She was the one where I realized the truth of your opinion OP, which should be a popular opinion. If you facilitate cheating, you are complicit.

BipolarReddit,fppw7r1,t3_geqs34,1588810357.0,"Wow there's a lot in what you've written that parallels my own coming to terms. The first year after my manic break, I definitely tried to act like nothing had happened. Everything that led up to the hospital and the shitstorm during and immediately after. And like you say, the sense of self suddenly became foggy. It was like my initial self was put in this crucible and cooked down to its base elements. I was still there, but I wasn't. 

I've been stable a long time, more than 15 years. When I look back to before balance, those first 4-5 years post-break were a time of ""becoming."" I wasn't my old self - that person died in the hospital. They, whoever they were, evaporated in the crucible. And for the first years, I was just kind of absent. It's a weird concept, but I was both me and not me. 

In my experience, there's stages to bipolar. There's young bp, who is fucked every which way and doesn't know they are bipolar. There's the person who breaks, which is the culmination of experience and accelerating illness. Then there's the person who is born in the fire, the person who sits in the ashes of what they used to be and thinks, what the hell is this? 

There's the person who has to fight like hell to get from the ashes to a decision to be healthy and all that entails - committing to medicine, to routine, to therapy, to introspection. And then comes the real you. It's after you get your fists around bipolar and wrestle it under control, and that's the strong, willful person who gets to live. It's like being born again. 

I have only scattered memories of my youth, handful of nightmares from the break to the decision to live, and then my life really begins. In some ways, I'm only about 15 years old, because I was born in the ashes of someone else. 

Sounds like you're taking these steps forward and that's awesome. So to question, who am I? What is this experience I'm enduring? And what does it mean to be me?

BipolarReddit,fpoz06o,t3_gekfwg,1588793092.0,"I'd suggest treating what you can easily control. Some of these:

\- Blood sugar. Moderate it, make sure you're eating enough of the right stuff such that your blood sugar is consistent. Eat when you don't want to, stop eating if you're on a binge. Easier said than done but blood sugar definitely counts toward moods. 

\- Exercise. Run it out of you, or pushups, or go smash things in the backyard. My personal go-to is a 3-mile walk. Pick a place 1.5 miles away. Walk there. Walk back. Physical exertion tires you out, releases dopamine and gives you something to focus on. Get out of your head and into the world through raw physical activity.

\- Escape in fantasy. Whatever your preferred long-form media, get into it. Binge some movies or a TV series, read a novel, play a video game - anything that allows you to escape yourself and live somewhere else for a while. 

\- Scream. Screaming is OK. Put your face in a pillow and just scream until you're empty. 

Those are some of my tricks. Always remember that it will pass. Bipolar is always one nasty wave after the next, but the next wave always comes, so this won't go on forever. I usually find some peace in repeating, ""this will pass."" And it always does."
BipolarReddit,fpoxqdl,t3_gekvny,1588792467.0,"A brutal reality for bipolar people is that absolutely no one can force them to health, period. Whether one is 16 or 60, the decision to be healthy must always come from internal acknowledgement that there is a better way to live and a commitment to doing the things it takes to get there - all of the things you mention as what you're trying to ""force"" him to do. It's difficult as a bipolar person to read about someone being ""forced"" to act in a certain way, partly because it infringes on a person's autonomy. But at the same time, I can understand the dire desire to help your dad get to a place of health. An impossible balance with no good answers. You want your dad to be healthy; as a human being, he deserves the right to live as he chooses, even if those choices are abhorrent to you and terrible for him. 

Generally, the line for some version of commitment gets drawn on our behalf when we make an effort to kill ourselves. I'll be real - the odds that your father is this depressed and isn't considering suicide is near zero. Indeed, suicide is an ever-present reality for bipolars - I would say all bipolars but I don't want to speak for everyone. Every bipolar I've ever met wrestles with it. It would be a fair assumption on your part that it is probably on his mind. 

So where's the balance? On the one hand, only he can make a commitment to health; you will never ever force him there, not permanently anyway. You should make peace with that, as terrible as it is. At the same time, it's very likely that he's suicidal and that the depression he is in supersedes rational thoughts like, my children want so much for me to be healthy I should get it together. Nah. That's not how bipolar works. 

Personally, the ideas of guardianship or commitment really run counter to what I can stomach, just because again it's an assault on autonomy. We get to walk the road we choose, even if it's walking off a plank. 

That's a lot of bad news and no advice. My advice, for what it's worth, is to pull back on forcing his actions and instead focus all of your attention on his thoughts. You need to penetrate the absent logic of deep depression, and that you are very well positioned to attempt. You're his kids. No matter how down he is, I'm sure he loves you and that love is perhaps the singular light in the darkness. Express love through discussion, even debate, force him to logic, not to behavior. That's probably your only shot at his decision to pursue persistent health. And it's his decision."

If you're flying the confederate flag, holding a noose and writing ""work will set you free"" on a sign, obviously you're an extremist. But unless that extreme belief crosses over into violence, you are not a terrorist, and therefore the US constitution permits your activities. That's not hypocrisy; that's the US system of government.

Don't get me wrong - I think the protests are batshit craziness that is sometimes (maybe even most times) being fueled and organized by extremists.

Stranded Deep feels similar in how you forge tools, need to be mindful of food/water/temperature, the basic mechanics of building. But for me it is much more compelling and more difficult in a lot of ways. There are more environmental challenges than just being cold, there are way more steps involved in satisfying hunger and thirst, it takes some serious effort to survive and build to a spot where you can really start exploring - the whole thing feels richer, even as the ""story"" is much vaguer. The game is almost a simulation game of being lost at sea.

Also, I love the movie Castaway, and this is clearly influenced by that movie. Even the music is similar. 

Also, lots and lots of sharks that are far too smart. 

Generally, I prefer Stranded Deep and for $20, it's a no-brainer. I'm more than a week into playing quite a bit and I feel like I've only scratched the surface of what I want to do, in addition to what the game wants me to do."

Swore that off for good and it's a hard no-go for me, but there was a time when I didn't give a fuck if a woman was in a relationship. I've been with women who broke it off after they cheated, who didn't break it off, who never intended to break it off and never told the person they're with (some still with). I've always noticed two distinct reasons why the women who cheated with me did so and they are related reasons.

1. They liked the attention. They liked my interest, they liked the salacious nature of our time together, the excitement of it, they liked having someone dote on them, talk with them - in short, they wanted that spark of a ""new"" relationship. 
2. They wanted to be sexually raunchy. Like they wanted to fuck hard and crazy. Idk what they did with their SOs while we were together, but the enthusiasm and ""give it to me MF!!!"" has always been way over the top, relative to women I've dated and they weren't in a relationship. 

Together, those reasons add up to: they wanted attention and excitement and they wanted to be naughty. Why they couldn't get that from their partners, probably many reasons, but those two factors were always present. 

Word to the wise - don't facilitate cheating. It hurts everyone, and to be sure, you are complicit in the cheating. You're not blameless. You should not sleep well at night as if you've done nothing wrong. I regret all the times I participated in cheating. I'd take it all back if I could."

bipolar,fohmtjv,t1_fohasd5,1587768609.0,"Maybe one good step is to help him start talking to other bipolar people. I had the same view of medicine for a long time, for the same reason - shitty doctors, wrong meds. That stuff leaves a lasting fear - and it is fear, not resistance, just fear. Fear that he'll feel as bad as he did those last times, fear that he'll try and it won't work and what that means for him, fear that he really will become a ""different person"" and lose himself. That's all entirely valid so I get where he's coming from. 

Perhaps that's one approach is to just say it flat out - I know you're afraid, that's OK. I've got your back, but you need to start taking this more seriously as it's impacting us. 

Some other ideas:

\- Rather than have a conversation, write it all down, make your words precise, express how you feel and how he makes you feel, then give him a long letter. If it's possible, try to have 24 hours between when you give him something to read and you guys discuss it. That way, rather than react in the moment and get defensive (because he's afraid, and possibly ashamed for not being perfect, that's a bipolar thing), he can digest it, think about it, re-read it - his first emotions can settle and then maybe you can get somewhere. 

For sure, don't say, ""you need meds."" That's a losing discussion. He'll take offense and then even start to wonder whether you're on his side at all (which will in turn be hurtful to you). Instead, maybe just go to the source of it - ""you're bipolar and untreated. that's unsustainable for you and for us."" And if he blows up, take a step back, ignore his reaction of anger stemming from fear, and always return to that core point - you are bipolar, bipolar people can't just be bipolar, they have to do something about it. 

Now, it would be awesome if he could come to this sub and just do some reading, educate himself. There's no reason to be afraid but without experience and info, why wouldn't he be? So information and surrogates are also your advocates. It's one thing for you to say there is an issue and it needs addressing, it's another thing entirely for a bipolar person to say to him, hey dude, you're fucking things up. I know you're afraid, I was too. Let's talk meds. That's probably a bit much right off the bat but the more he knows and sees what the path ahead looks like, the more confident he will feel in taking the next step. 

There is a chance that he has to have a very rough moment of clarity. Mine came when I was standing at the edge of death. For other people, it's something equally catastrophic - homelessness, prison, crippling drug addiction AND...someone he loves saying they are going to spend a month with a family member because you need space because you're being hurt too much. That may wake him up, and you should consider that as a tool in your toolbox. That doesn't mean leave him; just means you're taking space so everyone can think and decide what's next. 

He's not the first person to be in the position he's in - nor you, and you're a champion for seeking info and help. Amazing. He's fortunate. Overall, perhaps just insist on a conversation - and be cool as hell through the whole thing. No yelling, no crying, no criticism at all - keep it laser focused on 1. untreated bipolar is a losing battle, 2. untreated bipolar is affecting something he prizes (your relationship), 3. there's no reason to be afraid of treating bipolar. I can't tell you how amazing it is to be on the other side of fucked.  He has no idea what he's missing."

bipolar,foh93kz,t1_foh7co2,1587762075.0,"I'll be straight with you - if he's unmedicated, he'll never get to a place of balance. Period. Therapy is really important, as is his self-control and learning how to manage both his moods and the world around him. Bipolar isn't an excuse for shitty behavior. But I can't put much blame on the guy because an unmedicated bipolar person is quite simply fucked. The only way any of us get unfucked is through meds. 

Bipolar meds can be expensive, doctors are expensive, therapy is expensive, surviving as a bipolar person and living well is fucking expensive. (One of the many blessings of being bipolar /s). And yet, there is no other option. There are a handful of drugs that work on people like us, and we get to choose from that very small pool of potential. And if none of it works...we remain fucked. 

As a starting point for looking for hope, both of you need to get creative on how you get to a doctor and get meds going. And, this is the perhaps the hardest truth, he has to be the one to do it. He has to own his health. You can help research, you can help set up appointments (as he asks you to), you can even go to the session (if he wants you to), but he has to be the one making decisions. If he doesn't own it, it will never stick. I don't think there's ever been a bipolar person who was forced or coerced or coaxed into taking meds and it stuck. He has to reach a moment of clarity where he realizes, yeah, without meds, I'm fucked. 

I know you're asking for relationship support, and I hope you guys make it happen in a way that is possible. Ultimately, he has to decide to go get medicine and then he has to decide to take it every single day for the rest of his life. That's your hope. Guide him to that spot, the future is bright."

bipolar,foh6alt,t3_g7fjvu,1587761013.0,"There's a life philosophy lots of us end up using, which is when you experience an emotion that throws you, trace it back. Where did it come from? None of our emotions just pop out of nowhere - they all have triggers and then it gets away from us. Part of our challenge is figuring out and mastering the causes so that we don't slip down the mountainside into an emotion we can't control. 

In a moment of anger, dissect why you're angry, and don't just leave it at one step, go back many steps. X happened so you're angry. Why did X make you angry? Well because Y. And why is Y? Keep going back until you get to something that is manageable, concrete and objective, and then use that to disarm the whole thing AND prepare yourself for the future. The next time you see that cause pop up, you're ready for it, you understand it, and by that you're in better control. 

This works not just for anger but for sudden bursts of sadness, grandiosity, excitement, etc. The root cause of the cycles themselves is our brains and our genes. But our brains exist in a very complex environment where there are all sorts of things that will set us off. Control that, you control the surge in emotion, and then you control the cycle overall."

For me, it's less about whether there is a bp sub for it or whether it reminds me of my own challenges - what has started to irk me is stuff that is put up for validation with no real value to the community and no aspiration for/to support. ""Here's something I rapidly sketched out, I'm definitely not a pro and this isn't good but look what I did, I'm bipolar and making art."" OK, that's cool and all, and I support you in that, but that's not really something for a support group. 

Consider if we were all together in person in group therapy. One person says they're struggling with meds, the next says they can't sleep, the next says they want to kill themselves, the next says they are balanced and want to share that to encourage others - then someone stands up with a 30-minute pencil sketch and says look what I drew! 

OK, again, that's cool, but is that why the group came together? Or do you just want a pat on the back? And if so, well, hmm, isn't that a form of support? I'm straddling both sides here.

Really tough on where you draw the line. Some art I've seen is powerful stuff - there was the one dude who did a triptych of women with halos and that was amazing, expressive, and spoke to me. Who am I to say that someone's 30-minute pencil sketch doesn't speak to someone else? And in that, isn't that a form of support?

My ground truth - if you're an aspiring artist looking for validation, the bp art sub might be a better place to go. If you're an aspiring artist and you think what you created can speak to someone else in our really tough fight, well, it's subjective. Perhaps rather than saying artists shouldn't post their stuff here, we should just strongly encourage them to consider before posting WHY they are posting. 

And with that, it's easy enough to just scroll on and ignore it. To be sure, the amount of art is not hurting the quality of the support here. It's just sometimes kind of irritating, for me anyway."
