The site director liked to save up little obscure, non-clinical, irrelevant pimp questions and it was lose-lose because she was disappointed when you got it wrong and disappointed when you got it right. Half the attendings were incredibly rude, one wouldn't even talk to me, no one showed me what to do or where anything was so I was constantly trying to catch up. So many so-called feminist women who spend every spare second talking shit about each other and about their patients. The nurses saved my ass that rotation - they were the only people to be remotely kind to me for 6 weeks. I cried on the drive home every single day."

We even steal things to give to patients bc the copays on some equipment is too high for a patient without insurance. 

For what it's worth, my hospital has not been particularly transparent about changes in policy other than that we're in a shortage and people should try to conserve."

You can scrape the agar out of the plates, back into a beaker and re-autoclave that, but at that point I feel like you'd do better to just toss 'em and start from scratch.

Ideal temperature for pouring plates: let the autoclaved agar cool on the bench, swirling occasionally to keep it an even temperature. Swirl gently or you'll get bubbles. When the bottom of the flask is cool enough that you can hold it against the inside of your wrist for a bit without pain, it's cool enough to pour."

Residency,fj4unge,t3_fbf90f,1583017294.0,"Yep. Our jobs operate on a communist model and their jobs operate on a capitalist model. Decisions regarding our jobs are made on a national level, far removed from any individual hospital. Decisions about their jobs are made at the hospital level. And while I think in general each residency does what it can to support its residents, the program still has to have appropriate staffing levels, while keeping enough work off the attending's back that they can still attract attendings... so we're still gonna take the brunt of it.

I do think midlevels have a valuable role to play. I do think midlevels genuinely want to help patients. I understand that once they are in the field, they will advocate for their jobs, which I see as being a pretty natural thing to do. I think advanced training for midlevels is appropriate - if we agree that they are not going away, serve a role, and that we ultimately want to deliver good care, then extra training in whatever form makes sense. I want whoever is taking care of my patients to be good at their job.

The real battle is legislative, which unfortunately doesn't take place on the front lines where we work. Fights over white coats and nomenclature IMO mask the real problem, which is that our jobs are government-owned and thus we have no market value in an otherwise-capitalist system. It's fucked."

And while you may think you're the moderated, calming voice of an older, more experienced person... you're probably not. I was non-trad ie worked for several years in different fields before I went to med school. Most of my classmates had at least one or two gap years and a sizable number were like me and had been out in the working world for several years. A few of my classmates have children. Acting as though med students are wee smols who just haven't been out in the real world yet is just patronizing, particularly since *you* haven't been in *our* world yet.
