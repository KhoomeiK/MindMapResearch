AnaheimDucks,fcjtmpd,t3_ehd90e,1577704109.0,"Poland here, so a bit far from The Pond (though I'm planning on visiting whenever I have enough time and funds).

While there are some local teams here, hockey is rather unpopular (soccer/football seems to be our 'national sport', but that doesn't mean we're any good at it). I did get some compliments for my jersey, however people mostly associate the old logo with the movies, not the team.

However, this also means that the few hockey fans that I actually got to meet are crazy dedicated to the sport, staying late at night just to watch games. Instant drinking buddies.
