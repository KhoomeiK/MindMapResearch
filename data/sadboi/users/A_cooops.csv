I lost my dog literally a week and a half ago, it was her time to go but making that decision was heart breaking. It was the same with our dog beforehand. The fact that you show no emotion is frankly scary.

I’m sorry you’ve had that experience with your father. I very much can empathize with disabilities/illness being brushed off as laziness. It’s frankly one of the most unmotivating things when I am perceived as lazy, like sure guess I’ll be  what you think I am."

AmItheAsshole,fqpibb4,t1_fqolai0,1589547097.0,"24 my friends all went to college, some of there majors included; criminology, criminal justice, English, poli-sci, international relations, agriculture and food access, and Econ. Of all those majors I know one person who has a well paying job in their field and it’s the Econ major, it’s mostly bc he got lucky with my fathers connections. The rest of my friends all work shitty fucking jobs. 3 are in grad school, and despite they’re good grades they actually were rejected from many they applied too. Majority of them live with their parents and many rely on their families for some amount of financial support. 

I myself have never even had a real job, I struggle w chronic illness and wasn’t able to work consistently when I was younger. Most of my experience is in childcare. I am constantly applying for jobs outside of childcare but without the experience it’s nearly impossible. 

Are you sure you’re daughter isn’t trying? She may just not be having any fucking luck. It’s hard. And after COVID it’s going to be even harder.

Edit to add: I also wonder if your daughter has undiagnosed ADHD, depression or anxiety. Those things can all make it difficult to self motivate. ADHD especially can be hard to diagnose if it’s not on your radar and it’s can honestly be a huge weight. Getting treatment for it can feel life changing."

I understand now what you were saying bc you clarified. But the way you responded to the other person was just gross. Like they were obviously confused and rightfully offended you’d immediately jump to it happening in the projects.

The friction is damaging the skin, possible causing small tears, and doesn’t have time to heal between. Similar to if you had a blister kept wearing the same shoes. I would recommend putting antibacterial ointment on (such as bacitracin or neosporin) and slapping some bandaids aid. I’d only use bandaids for a day or too but continue with ointment. Then to prevent more friction you can use vasiline.

I use a product called ‘for her: antichafe and moisturizing’ it’s made by a brand called Body Glide. I highly recommend this product. It’s been a life saver for me for both chaffing and blisters. I’m actually known for having it on nights and it’s a life saver for heel wearers lol."
