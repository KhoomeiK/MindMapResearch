celestegame,fdsb8yf,t3_emwfh9,1578698626.0,"Grab the jelly fish and jump into the block on the left. Bounce to the one on the right then back to the wall on the left. Throw the jelly fish at the wall and when it bounces back dash upwards and grab it again. Then move and get the pink dash block on the right while bouncing off of the right block again. Move over to the next wall on the left and then do the jellyfish bounce twice as fast as possible. If done correctly you should catch the left moving block and be able to catch the bounce. Then bounce off the right block, and you should be able to reach the key. It takes practice but you'll get it eventually. Use a guide if needed as well because they can help with the timings. Hope this helps"
