NPD,fqgdegf,t1_fqgcosb,1589343457.0,"On one hand, you’ll find people truly embrace their narcissism and use it as an excuse for shitty behavior. On the other hand, you’ll find the guy who went to therapy for being depressed (or for other ego-dystonic/neurotic disorders), got diagnosed with NPD and now wishes to change. Well, there’s obviously a middle ground but for brevity’s sake, let’s just assume these two. 

The former will have higher self esteem than the latter. Why? Because the latter *knows* that something needs to change. He’s unhappy with his life because he’s self aware. He sees how his behavior affects people around him. He may not be in touch with his emotions, but he sees the damage and wants to get better. This breakthrough realization is the extremely depressing. 

The former will likely be trigger-happy and revel in his destruction, internally of course. So you see why this guy will have a higher self esteem. 

All this is relative though. No person with NPD has a normal level of self esteem. We’re all deeply insecure, and the grandiose behavior and thoughts are mere compensations. I’m not projecting or generalizing. You should read more about it. There are types of narcissism too. Grandiose, malignant, covert/vulnerable. Etc."

I (F) was diagnosed with borderline PD at first. Growing up, I had nobody to model healthy relationships for me. Narcissistic parents. Abusive exes. Backstabbing friends.

I advise you to start building an identity for yourself. Find things that you like to do; and focus on the world OUTSIDE of you. Staying inside your head is the worst thing you can do for your mental health. It’ll give rise to increased neuroses, and you’ll keep drowning in victim mentality. Avoid *unproductive* rumination and *useless* rationalizations at all costs. Find your interests (it could be anything, from politics to philosophy to art, etc.) and then find likeminded people and engross yourself in the pursuit of education and greatness. It doesn’t matter how far you go. What matters is that you keep moving ahead. Work on your physical health. Gyms are closed as of yet due to the pandemic, but find time for basic stretching exercises, breathwork and meditation. 

I know all too well that this sounds like “neurotypical” advice. But the more you mope, the more miserable you will be. I can assure you from personal experience that this works, at least to a degree where you’re functional and don’t wish to end it all. Wish you good luck!

If the narcissist discards somebody, they will move on and never look back. But if they’re being discarded, one may expect to encounter rage. You should expect the narcissist to fly off the handle when that happens. Personally, I’m more careful about how I express my anger and thus, I would attempt to draw the person back in to hurt them in a subtle fashion to exact revenge. 

Just block and move on. It doesn’t matter what your partner is feeling. In all likelihood, he’s not in touch with his feelings, so he’s gonna move on fast. Focus only on your healing and take related matters into your own hand."

Antipsychiatry,fpabclu,t1_fpa8sr9,1588444630.0,"I’ll start from last to first. You’re discounting the experience of millions of people who have had traumatic pasts, genetic predispositions to mental illnesses, or just difficult life circumstances... who are coping with recreational marijuana usage, and leading healthy lives and maintaining good relationships. Comparing marijuana to stimulants is a huge mistake. In fact, comparing marijuana to other drugs is a huge mistake too. It’s a plant, consumed as a plant. When you see no obvious benefit, you do a risk-benefit analysis. If the benefits outweigh the risks, you do it. That’s why I’m a proud recreational marijuana user. 

You’re right. “Ofc not” is not support. But it isn’t as bad, compared to telling someone that trusting an authority blindly is okay, especially when they’re potentially in a psychiatric crisis. Anybody with paranoid thoughts or traumatic experiences with the psychiatric community (it IS a community, because it’s an echo-chamber, unwilling to look at anecdotal evidence apart from the ones that suit its narrative) would be scared to death to trust an authority who forcefully drugs them with psychotropic medications. 

Lastly, since I’m not sure if you or anyone else is gonna read this, I am a medical student, going to be a doctor soon. I’m N O T against medication. I’m not against psychotherapy. They have their place. They should be used as a LAST resort, when the individual who has been suffering years has tried their own methods to heal. 

What I’m against is, indiscriminate use of medication, overdiagnosis, and the sheer authoritative behavior of psychiatrists who are -more often than not- sponsored by pharmaceutical companies. I’m FOR informed recreational drug (especially psychedelic) usage. If you’re not, that’s okay. What’s not okay is you implying that it’s inherently bad because you don’t understand its nature."
