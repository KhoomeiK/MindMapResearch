Btw I remember your username, you're a pretty active member of r/marvelstudios right?"
shield,fp5zvhl,t1_fp5y9ix,1588343378.0,Upon rewatching I noticed that they even made an appearance in the show!

shield,fp41lkb,t1_fp3zu6d,1588289897.0,Yeah exactly! In fact I may or may not have some clothing that somewhat resembles one of Coulson's classic suits.
shield,fp3zcwo,t1_fp3yvr7,1588288666.0,"Damn yeah if only I had their number haha.

Also did you see the post of that S.H.I.E.L.D badge that someone is selling on this sub. I think they look awesome and I kinda want one as a memory of the show."
shield,fp3z70k,t1_fp3ro20,1588288577.0,"They definitely look awesome and I'm interested for sure but seeing as I'm a teenager without any real form of income, I'll definitely negotiate a bit haha. Also I live in the Netherlands, can you ship them and if so, how much more would it cost?"

shield,fp3wup1,t1_fp3wjtg,1588287299.0,Awesome! My only fear is that I'm not 100% sure that the episodes will be released at the same time in the Netherlands (where I live) since we can only watch it on Disney+. And D+ never premiered an AoS season before so I have no clue how good they'll handle it.
shield,fp3w7pz,t1_fp3vujp,1588286954.0,"And if you don't mind, I think I'll dm you when s7 airs so we can hype eachother up, discuss our theories and be depressed when it ends!"

shield,fp3rk6t,t1_fp3n9hm,1588284509.0,I always feel bad making offers and misjudging the value. Any chance you can give us somewhat of an average price? My budget isn't the biggest but If it's affordable I can't resist with awesome stuff like this.
shield,fp2ct3w,t1_fp2biks,1588259510.0,"That's exactly the reason why I love Endgame so much. God just imagine if Coulson is the one who actually founds S.H.I.E.L.D in the past. ""There is no S.H.I.E.L.D without you"" would gain a completely new meaning haha.

It feels good to talk about some AoS theories btw. I hate how this show gets overlooked by most people."
shield,fp2asrc,t1_fp29s5e,1588258465.0,"Absolutely! Some people find it cheap storytelling, but I'm personally thrilled about the time travelling. I loved it in Endgame and I'll most likely love it in AoS!!"

CAN IT BE MAY THE 27TH ALREADY???"
shield,fp28qc4,t1_fp25lrr,1588257361.0,Yes exactly. Here is hoping season 7 joins the other four!
shield,fp254hw,t3_gavc40,1588255332.0,Prolly either season 1 or 6. I mean I still love both of them but I can't deny that those are lower tier.

POTCmemes,fou1qz8,t1_fotzr61,1588073669.0,Well unfortunately Captain Jack is not actually in the game. The only NPC's that have a human appearance are villagers. So he used the one that resembled a pirate the most. (And yeah they are all bald lol)
