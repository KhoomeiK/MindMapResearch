You’re a good friend, and that’s one of the best compliments that can be received in this situation - all you ever did was stick by her, and the fact you did that and never backed down shows how good of a person you are. You just sticking up for her even now just goes above and beyond - it was something I wasn’t able to do myself, and regret it a lot.
