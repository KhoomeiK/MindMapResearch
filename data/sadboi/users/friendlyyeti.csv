ZonaEnts,fpspav9,t1_fps7oml,1588877313.0,Organix is my favorite example of wax that’s mediocre- it’s $18 usually but at the same dispo you can usually get PCC for $22 which is much better and only a $4 change
ZonaEnts,fprtxt0,t1_fprs8a6,1588861973.0,"My question as well, my pals and I have a running joke about how having a gram of Venom shatter is a sign shit ain’t goin well.
I’m not sure about their carts but as far as most of their concentrates it seems that you can get a much better product for $3-10 more from a different brand. 
I would also try Nature’s Vapes, they’re carts sold by natures meds out in Phoenix. They’re definitely not the best carts but they run $35 a g and they do the trick. I personally don’t use carts because I don’t trust like that but I’ve heard good things from friends! (If you have a higher tolerance though or just have the financial means you should definitely spend the money and get a nicer brand like Select when it comes to carts)"
ZonaEnts,for1gbr,t3_g7i0ll,1588004530.0,"When it comes to your employer there are some jobs that can look into and find out if you have your med card, most of these jobs are healthcare and government positions. Still with those after you take your drug test an agent from the testing center will call you and tell you you tested positive for marijuana, they’ll confirmed that you have smoked within the past month and then ask if you have a valid medical card and for your ID number off it. Depending on what job you applied for they either send back a false negative to your new company or they disclose that you have your med card and issue the recommendation that you should be hired anyways. 
That’s my lose understanding of it!"

ALWAYS donate your organs nothing bad can come of it!!!!"
AskReddit,epnoxfl,t3_bv51tj,1559330892.0,"After being diagnosed with bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder I tried to kill myself and spent two weeks in the mental hospital afterwards. Being a 16 year old at the time, the easiest way for me to cope while healing was trying to make light of the situation while on the unit. I tried to be lighthearted and was often seen cracking jokes trying to make the other patients laugh and distract them from whatever seemed to have brought them there. 
When I was finally discharged two weeks later one of the nurses, who was very no nonsense, (I was certain he hated me due to my demeanor) discharged me and walked me out with my parents. As I was leaving he grabbed me by the shoulders looked me in the eyes and said, “I don’t want to see you back here, you don’t belong here”.  And gave me a hug. He looked at my parents and told them that I was going to go places, he told them ""she has a good heart"".
Any time I reach that low again I think of Sam and think what he said to me and my parents when we needed to hear it most.
""She has a good heart"" echos in my head on the worst nights and keeps me around. Thank you Sam, mental health workers are real life heros."

AskReddit,ep35rc2,t3_btoccm,1559017817.0,"As a kid I was very gullible and my dad told me a handful of stories to explain things as I was a child that I, for whatever reason, never decided to question.
One I asked how thy traffic lights worked and he explained very logically that when every car is made the manufacturer puts a sensor under the road to “track” how long you have been driving. These “sensors” would then tell the traffic lights to turn red if you’ve been driving for awhile and should give other cars a chance.
Another one he got me with was the Cell Phone Lot at the airport. The cell phone lot is just a parking lot where people can park until the person they’re picking up is ready. My dad told me it was a parking lot with a pile of cellphones in it that people had lost at the airport and technically if you wanted one you could just grab it out of the pile. 
For whatever reason both of those and many more explanations he gave me made a ton of sense in my head and it honestly wasn’t until I was about 15-16 that I learned a lot of his explanations weren’t real just because I never questioned them"

BipolarReddit,eok7xjw,t3_bs8dp0,1558648598.0,Choosing to take your meds or not will always be a choice you have to make for yourself Because you know you best. However from my experience I recommend that you stay on them. If you aren’t feeling any negative effects and your life is going how you want it to then stay on them. It’s worrying that you’re beginning to feel hypomanic again and should be a sign to yourself that maybe they were correct in that diagnosis. Just keep in mind it’s a lot harder to get back on meds than to just remind yourself to keep taking them every day!! Feel free to reach out if you have more questions! Also I’m very glad you found this subreddit it has helped me a lot!
confessions,eodt5dl,t3_bre1aq,1558480412.0,"Honestly you need to get resources and help right away to manage these behaviors if they're getting out of hand and disrupting your life. The longer you let negative behaviors go on unchecked the child learns that negative behavior = reward or what they want
Now that's easy to say but if you take away some thing your child most likely won't understand that consequence. That's when you need help of professionals to determine what's goin on. I would also look into the functions of behaviors. There's studies that show all behaviors are caused by a certain function to reach an end goal. It might help to identify what your child is trying to accomplish with these behaviors. For mine they always want attention. Hope this helped... Feel free to private message me with any questions or just to talk. Rasing a baby with autism is so so so hard and keep reminding yourself you're not evil you just feel trapped."
