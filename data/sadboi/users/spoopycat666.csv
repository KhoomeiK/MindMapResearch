BPD,fl2xxnq,t3_flowf0,1584762881.0,Yes. I have been diagnosed with ADHD but I feel that BPD is the reason why its so hard to be patient and forgiving with myself. Everyone tells me not to be so hard on myself and I know it’s not helpful but it’s hard to recognise even with DBT skills.
BPD,faryzml,t3_eacv2c,1576321698.0,"Yes. I’ve been considering breaking up with my SO because I can’t control the way I speak to him when I’m overwhelmed. No outright attacks but my tone of voice is nasty and I can yell. It’s gotten to the point where I have outbursts in public now too. I’ve done DBT but I can never remember to use my skills in the moment so. I don’t think I can  be in a relationship right now if I can’t control my anger, but he doesn’t want me to leave."
BPD,f7q65ls,t3_dwtonu,1573959343.0,"I’ve thought I have BPD since I was 15. Even before years of CBT. 
After revealing my diagnosis to someone I was close friends with around that time, they said “I’ve been telling you you had that all along!”"
BPD,ewqo6hh,t3_cplnze,1565672241.0,"If you’re in a toxic environment it can help but in my experience the same feelings follow, just paired with disappointment."
BPD,es8ns3b,t3_c6czui,1561705407.0,I always thought this was a symptom of dissociation... when I’m super distressed I know what words I want to say but I can’t make them come out. Or the only words I can think of are dark automatic (usually suicidal) thoughts and I see it as manipulative saying them out loud.
