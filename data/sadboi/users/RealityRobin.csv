In your minds' eye, see that teenager who was deeply hurt.  He didn't know how to recover from such a powerful moment in his life.  He didn't know how to grieve, and so he never got over it.

You need to be the adult to that younger version of yourself.  Tell that kid it's okay to cry; tell him that kind of insult was completely unwarranted.

One, start with your own family... a sibling, a cousin, anyone.  Start being more open and honest with one of them.  You're safe because it's family (hopefully), and you may find a close relationship with one of them.  If you don't, you could try and tag-along with that relative and their best friend.  Watch how they interact with each other; maybe you'll learn something.

Second, try to be a caring and thoughtful friend.  I wanted to be closer to a work-friend so I paid attention.  Her mother passed away ( in January)and I made an effort to be there for her and check in often.  When Mother's Day came around I made sure to check in with her and let her know I was thinking of her.  Meaningful conversations and moments happen when we help each other. 
And BTW we ended up being friends outside of work as well. Until I moved again üòú

Third, find your own ""peeps"" by getting out there and finding what YOU enjoy.  (This doesn't work that well with sports or large gatherings.  It needs to be a bit more intimate, in a totally non-sexual way. )  It works better through creative outlets... where you discuss your ideas, thoughts and beliefs.  Music, art, poetry, are always going to lead to more meaningful exchange.

Fourth, keep dating and looking for that one person who will always want you as their first choice.  Don't settle for anything less in your romantic relationship.

You are not wrong to want alone time.  You'll find plenty of research outlining how some people ""re-charge"" from activity or from social situations... while others need quiet, alone time to re-charge.

What does she say when you tell her its necessary?  Like mental health necessary?  Does she not understand it?  I (50F) married to hubby (54M) for 30 years and he used to drive me bat-shit crazy during the first two years.  He would be around all the time and I was NEVER alone!  I think I once asked him, ""When are you going home?  Like, someplace else.""

It worked out for us because his job ended up needing him to travel pretty frequently.  He would go work (and hang out at the bar afterwards with his coworkers, meet people, be social, etc.) and I stayed home, blissfully alone.  It's not too much to ask.

My suggestions would be:

Find what hobby she has been interested in lately and sign her up for the class and buy her all the materials she needs... if she's out Wednesday night every week to go do knitting/photography/roller derby with new friends and classmates; that makes Wednesday night the evening when you make plans.

Or, start coming home every day at a new, later time.  Maybe 30 minutes?  Come home ""early"" one day a week where you really focus on **her** and give her the attention she craves.  But not every day.  She'll be upset the first time you arrive home late, but hand her a bouquet of flowers and a bottle of bubbly and say, ""I just wanted to stop quickly and pick these up for my beautiful wife who I love so much.""

You could set up Gmail email accounts and use the shared calendar to put in appointments and ""date nights,"" ""Sunday Shopping"" or any other activity that you can make romantic.  I wouldn't lie, but I would block out my own ""me time"" as unavailable.

If you own your home you could decide that you want to be a gardener or DIY Guy and be outside ""at home with her"" working on the house.  Bonus points if you actually DO the yard work : )

sex,f4tr6x5,t1_f4tly97,1571792789.0,"This is good advice:

""If you can get a good angle and hook your fingers so that you've got contact with her gspot, you can move your arm back and forth instead of trying to flex your fingers. That leaves very little room for error as long as you keep contact with the right spots.""

Once you've zeroed in on a spot she likes,  don't just keep hammering AROUND that spot and ""missing"" it.  Keeping your hand position and angle steady is key.  Vary the SPEED but not the position or angle that's driving her crazy.

FIND that spot by paying attention to your partner.  Does she lean closer when you touch somewhere?  Does her pelvis start to rock slowly?  Listen to her... does she ramp up or down?  If you pay attention, you can find her likes and dislikes."
bipolar,f4sywwj,t3_dlngff,1571782229.0,"I can suffer from this too.  I really tried to get into the habit of doing the bare minimum.  Telling myself that no matter what else happened, at least I did 15 minutes of housework or yard work.  I've done it for so long now it's just muscle memory; kind of like fastening my seat belt.  I just *start*, and sometimes it ends up making me feel better; at least I worked on \_\_\_\_\_\_ for 15 minutes."

aspergers,f3flla6,t3_dgs7c3,1570898927.0,"I found  the website Flylady.org over 15 years ago, and I still follow her tips on routine.  The trick is, you don't ever have to develop a routine if you don't want to; you need to start developing better habits.

If you're in the habit of putting your keys/sunglasses in the same place every night, you don't lose them or run late.

If you're in the habit of putting your devices on charge every night, you probably won't run out of battery.

If you're in the habit of shopping and prepping meals for the week, you probably won't find yourself hangry and irritable.

If you're in the habit of paying bills every Friday at 3:00pm, you never pay late fees.

I've stacked together a good amount of habits... and they're so automatic I don't have to use up precious mental energy just to get a load of laundry done or get the bed made.  It really helps"

bipolar,f1q9igz,t3_dahvgy,1569696242.0,"You need to either schedule out your day, or start developing better habits.

I can schedule a perfect day; but I won't do it.  If you're the type who can, then schedule work, sleep, eating, grooming, and leisure time... and decide ahead of time what your leisure will be.  

Maybe the same things don't appeal to you, but you can schedule things like 30 minutes of reading, 30 minutes of mild exercise, 30 minutes of gardening, etc.  Some people can really feel better with a routine or a schedule like this.

(If none of your previous interests appeal to you, go to science.  Science has PROVEN methods of how to be happier.  Just trying to meditate can make you happier!  Volunteering or having a pet are proven ways to be happy.  You CAN schedule free time so you keep a balance of work, sleep and leisure.

I can't seem to schedule things; but I can make my life feel better by following some good habits. 
It's my habit to take my meds; charge my phone; clean up after myself; floss every morning and be grateful every night.  I also am getting in the habit of doing something nice for my husband/child EVERY DAY.  

And remember, happiness is a side effect, not a true goal."
