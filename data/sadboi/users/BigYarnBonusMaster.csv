I can partly relate to your experience, although it happens exclusively in the areas of rape and asphyxiation. I go to therapy and I find it really helpful; my therapist accepts and understands; or tries to when he can’t. But it took many months before for the first time I sort of formed a sentence that somewhat, partially implied what I couldn’t say directly: “I get turned on when I read about rape on the news”.

It’s quite uncomfortable to write it “out loud” in here right now, but I want to “repay” your courage a bit by letting you know there are others out there who may understand what you are struggling with. 

What do you fear will happen if you talk to a therapist about the things you describe? That may be worth thinking about.

Either way, thank you for checking out my post and for your kind words.

I am indeed still going to the gym, 5 or so times/week; my health is still a bit of a struggle so my fitness has become a crucial tool to keep me together and sane. I've been seeing the same doctors for the last couple of years and they all seem so happy to have seen the progression throughout the last few months. I almost feel like I make them proud, they are genuinely happy for me. I often think about them when I'm lifting.

Anyway, I've reached my goal weight and relaxed the caloric defitic a bit. I'm more or less still doing the same things that I mentioned in my post, so I just focus on staying consistant.

Now with the virus I think gyms will be closing in not too long (UK) so I'm looking at bodyweight workouts to do at home.

I'd be keen to hear how you're getting on so far if you want to share, and if you have any questions please do ask, I could talk about fitness and nutrition for ever.

I read both your posts and to see you face your fears head on, with so much strength and courage, makes me respect the hell out of you and want to give something, anything, to say “you are amazing”. You really thought through things, didn’t just post for validation, actually listened to what people where saying even when they weren’t saying what you wanted to hear. My heart weeps for you because you didn’t get the outcome you deserve despite such a display of human emotional elegance. A stupid Reddit icon won’t do anything, but the first time I got Platinum it surprised me and kinda made me excited if only for a few minutes. Maybe it will do something similar for you?

Whatever life brings you, with such personality, courage and skills, you’ll make the best out of it, I’m sure of that. And I know it now hurts but part of me is happy that this “man” is no longer going to be in your life. He wasn’t bringing good to your life, including the things you want (and deserve) for yourself.

An update here, a response there, maybe once a day, or once every 2 days, I don’t know yet. They won’t be sessions, but way more worthwhile and natural for us.

TalkTherapy,fk9uyc6,t3_fh8oz3,1583984210.0,"I think it depends a lot on the person and their issues the therapist and the chemistry between them. I don’t know the people writing here, their circumstances or therapists. But some of them seem to imply that they don’t fully trust their T and don’t plan on doing so; they seem OK with that. And I wonder whether it would make a positive difference if they actively tried to fully trust their therapists; as vertigo-inducing as it can be. That’s just my two cents in case it helps anyone out there.

When I finally fully started trusting my therapist, our relationship and work got to a whole new level. There’s been a few breakthroughs and I can’t tell you how happy I am about that, it’s made a big difference. And there’s something very healing about allowing oneself to fully trust another human being for the first time in your life. It fucks you up when you don’t have that choice as a child. We are meant to be able to trust our caregivers so we can learn that trust is not always a dangerous liability and potential risk to our survival.

Going back to your question, for me it was 7 months. What contributed towards it?
- My therapist is incredibly consistent, week after week; he’s very, very good at his job and for months he put my best interest at heart again and again and again. Eventually I started believing him.
- He’s not what a lot of people think therapists are. He’s not there to say nice things to me and show sympathy and say “there, there” while I cry. He’s there to help me get better and build a new future for myself. He doesn’t give compliments or comments like “that must have been hard”, “things are going to be OK”, “you’re so strong”. He’s realistic and honest, time and time again. Which means that when he says something, both for better or worse, it’s true regardless. That approach has been a big change from all the mental health professionals I’ve worked with and I can’t tell you what a positive difference it makes for me. 

I know if I ask something and he doesn’t know, he’ll openly say so. If he doesn’t think I’m right, he’ll say so. If he thinks I’ve got the potential to heal from what’s happened to me and come out the other end a healthier, happier me, he’ll say so. And he does."

TalkTherapy,fjx57xy,t1_fjvbx14,1583657292.0,"I see where you’re coming from and I think you bring some excellent points. However for many of us it is crucial to form and work on long-term attachments with our therapists. I think a CBT therapist may be less concerned about this than a psychodynamic psychotherapist.

There are many therapists out there who understand this and operate accordingly. For example, not taking complex patients if they know they are planning to be moving/retiring soon.

My therapist doesn’t even take a vacation without giving 6 week notice. He could die tomorrow in a car accident, but as far as anything in his control goes, he’s “not going anywhere”. And I can’t tell you how important that is in my current treatment.

Wouldn’t be right for all types of therapies and conditions, but I just wanted to offer a different point of view. Nothing “stops me from making the best of the time we have”, but I need to not have that “deadline” in sight at the moment as part of my treatment."

TalkTherapy,fjx39mm,t3_ff4nko,1583654706.0,"I’m surprised no one has mentioned the obvious: discuss what you’re telling us with your therapist.

I doubt nothing will come from that conversation; the both of you may realise that this was too much too fast for you, or that she hit the nail right on the head and has already found an important area  to work on, or that she is not the right fit for you. 

Either way I would strongly encourage you to take that route and talk about things with your therapist before you give up with 0 communication.

That said, when I’ve had similar experiences as yours, it’s been a sign of progress. The thought of a “little frightened girl” used to make me CRINGE. It’s taken me almost 13 months to start healing that relationship with her.

I have a background of childhood trauma, which also included a lot of neglect. Only through therapy I've learnt that not having had experiences of healthy emotional intimacy with my parents (being cuddled, consoled when upset, been made safe in the home...) resulted in 0 experiences of emotional intimacy until I started dating and having sexual relationships with my first boyfriend.

As a result I find it near impossible to navigate through any emotional intimacy at any level; including that with most people, both men and women. And when I do, my intimacy is processed in my brain only in a sexualised way. And I feel so broken.

- You feel very worried about people abandoning you, and would do anything to stop that happening.
- You have very intense emotions that last from a few hours to a few days and can change quickly (for example, from feeling very happy and confident to suddenly feeling low and sad).
- You don't have a strong sense of who you are, and it can change significantly depending on who you're with.
- You find it very hard to make and keep stable relationships.
- You feel empty a lot of the time.
- You act impulsively and do things that could harm you (such as binge eating, using drugs or driving dangerously).
- You often self-harm or have suicidal feelings.
- You have very intense feelings of anger, which are really difficult to control.
When very stressed, you may also experience paranoia or dissociation.
