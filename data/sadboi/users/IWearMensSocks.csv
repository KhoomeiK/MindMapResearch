There have been time where my child has given me reason to believe they may be trans and I indulged those times, but they all have been phases so far. I am non binary, but will have gender reveals in the future if I have more children. Because I believe celebr was ting the most likely gender of my child is valuable, and preparing for that gend25r is valuable. If my child is not cis I will more than gladly support and assist with their identity. But most people are cis. And as a non-cis person I think celebrating gender is a beautiful thing. If people choose to celebrate the most-likely gender of their child before birth that is their choice as a parent. Stop judging others for doing things differently than you would do them."

But the prison statistic is directly related to WHY men and women are GENERALLY in prison. Men go for murder, rape, and other violent crimes USUALLY. Women usually go for crimes like child neglect (which is awful but men get shorter prison time for that just like women do), or fraud. These statistics are the same as the pay gap one. Yes, there is a pay gap, but more men are in higher paying jobs which contributes to that statistic. Women are working to have higher paying jobs. Men are just complaining about how ""NoBoDy ApPrEcIaTeS oUr StRuGgLe"" even though a TON of media is about depression shines men in a good light and women in bad light. Examples: Bojack Horseman, Atypical, To The Bone, hell even 13 Reasons Why lends more sympathy to the lead male character. We are ALL aware of the male struggle.
