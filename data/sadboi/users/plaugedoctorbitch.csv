I must say though as much as you don’t like the stuff you listed don’t be down on others for it. Everyone is allowed to like things. That being anime, manga, internet culture. I’m sure it wasn’t your intent but it felt a bit like you were trashing all those things simply because they don’t appeal to you. I hope you fall in love with the game again though, good luck x"
