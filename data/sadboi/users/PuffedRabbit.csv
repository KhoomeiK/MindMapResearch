Justifying cruelty by comparing it to other kinds of cruelty is the most stupid thing you can do. Dehumanizing other HUMANS because of their ethnicity/ideologies/race/whatever is the easiest thing to do, and one of the most common mistakes we do.

If they are ""subhuman creatures who want to kill americans"" because they will defend their country from foreigners who have no intention to do something good with them, then I'd wish to see what would happen if a bigger enemy invaded the US.

We'd cry, beg and angrily point to those commiting atrocities like shooting school buses, bombing civilian cities and going out of their way to kill anyone with a gun in their person, because they would be a threat.

Every open carry state would see quite a massacre, and those who'd try to defend their families would get vaporized by dozens of soldiers, who would laugh and say ""oh well"" while looking into the fridge for something to eat because they are hungry, and the dead won't need it.

But hey, are they wrong? Nah, war is a hell of a thing, and they were justified because they felt threatened by a man carrying a rifle when they were inside a bullet proof vehicle with gigantic weapons and thousands of rounds; how could we expect them to make decisions while on that much stress? they could be killed!

But well, I don't know why am I trying to change the minds of those who voluntarily refuse to. Guess the best propaganda is one you push young, and one you can't tell is propaganda.

I am personally an owner of a Gt-191 and I haven't had any problems with it, but most of the other users haven't had so much luck, so I don't know if it's worth the risk



Edit: I would also add that in terms of precision, newer models (regardless of brand and pricing) are way better than older ones; we have improved a huge amount from our elder capacitive screens to our dual sensors (one in-pen and one on-screen) and the ability to vary sensitivity in a gigantic range; and while I would recommend higher-end models mostly because of firmware updates and durability (Wacom is really good), using a huion with enough care would most probably let you to same results as a Wacom would

forwardsfromgrandma,fgl4m4o,t3_eyv4e8,1580881853.0,"Not really related, but this sparked a question in my mind that I hope someone can clarify for me.

Why is pedophilia (Child Molestation, not just the paraphilia by itself) not considered a crime punishable by death?

Just a question, sorry for my ignorance"
