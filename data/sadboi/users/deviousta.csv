mentalhealth,fc59q35,t1_fc58xyz,1577450152.0,I feel sorry for you for feeling this lost. I really don't know what to say than to just hang on but yeah probably won't help if you're that far in. Wish you the best and hope you'll figure things out before it's too late.
mentalhealth,fc54fzs,t1_fc4y919,1577442637.0,Can I pm you about this because I still have questions haha. Otherwise this thread will lose its main purpose about other things haha
penpals,fc4q8u5,t1_fc4q1g8,1577424510.0,Haha I actually don't know. We have two provinces called north Holland and South Holland but that's it for the Holland name. I guess it's just easier for some people to remember or something hahaha. I really don't know. Have asked this to someone myself but we don't know.

mentalhealth,fc4ijek,t1_fc4i78y,1577417664.0,"Yeah I see how you think it's selfish but it's actually in the best care for your sister. Rather that than not caring for each other at all. Hopefully she'll overcome this so you can stay together as brother and sister. But on the bright side, science is going so quickly so maybe they'll find a way to manage the symptoms and cure (or make easier to live with) the disorder. (sorry in Dutch so I'm translating everything in my head)"
mentalhealth,fc4ffuz,t3_eg509n,1577415108.0,I'm so sorry to hear this and really send love to you and your family. I hope maybe they'll find the cause/trigger of her seizures so she won't have them any more or that often. I don't know how you must be feeling but I can imagine it feels like worthless because you can't do anything for her. Idk. I just feel with you.

AskReddit,fc4bmbu,t3_eg4kwf,1577411980.0,Took my best friend for granted and didn't see him very often but he was there when I needed him and vice versa. And then he passed away last year (2018) in an accident on his vacation. So now I'm more committed to the friendships (and my family while I still have everyone) I have left.

mentalhealth,fc489zq,t1_fc482tj,1577409313.0,No problem. Hope you'll find your inner peace soon and get the help you need to grow. Best of wishes to you!
mentalhealth,fc47fz4,t1_fc46jpn,1577408656.0,"Great to hear you have that friend group. That's something good. I know it's tough when you think they secretly hate you. I feel easily rejected when someone doesn't respond to my texts and get really sad about that. Right now I'm looking here for tips about that stuff. But if no one has tips I have to get help because it's getting worse to handle and it happens more often. 

About emailing the specialist. The fact that you want help is bad enough to get help. Anyone who's not actively affected by struggles like this doesn't think about getting help. And you sure want help but how is just a thing to work on. Uhm 
Don't mean to upset you just trying to say it directly instead of drifting around it (sorry I'm Dutch so translating everything in my head while typing this). So If you feel the need for help go get it. You're doing great here but as far as I know there aren't specialists looking though sites like this and therefore no one can help you like they can. A specialist is trained to help people like you and me. So let them. It's good to talk about it but they can help you overcome the struggles."
mentalhealth,fc461xa,t1_fc3slfj,1577407584.0,I hope you can find help to deal with this. Sounds really tough to cope with this. Wish you all the best and hope that you'll feel better soon!
mentalhealth,fc45t24,t1_fc3vwoh,1577407394.0,I'm on Concerta too since this week. But I feel more exhausted then I felt before. I've had other medication (Methylfenidaat) and didn't feel as exhausted like I am now. Did you experience exhaustion when you first started the Concerta? I'm having it for my ADD and to make my emotions a little less heavy. You know?
mentalhealth,fc45b4m,t3_eg1zrq,1577407017.0,"I really just had the same discussion with someone else. You can't be cured if you really got depressed. But it can come in waves. I know the difference between feeling sad or being depressed. Because when I'm depressed nothing can make me feel alive anymore and nothing makes me feel warm and happy. Everything I used to love makes me feel like it's forced and experience no fun doing it. But when it's on the background and I'm able to enjoy things I love to do that's when I know it's ""gone"" but never cured. I've had two suicidal moments in my life where one of them I was like 9 years old and made an attempt on killing myself. That feeling is my wakeup call to get help to sort things out. That way the depression goes away for a bit till I'm wandering off again and everything starts all over. So idk if this text made any sense but I hope you know what I'm trying to say."
mentalhealth,fc44pdh,t3_eg2uir,1577406567.0,"May I ask what's causing you to think about ending your life? Because what helps me is talking about it or think about what keeps me here on earth. Like my parents, my sister etc. Find the thing / person / place anything you feel connected to that keeps you here and then focus on recovering. I've made attempts of killing myself at the age of (idk exactly) 9 or something and my mom found me. Honestly that pain and grief I caused her by just seeing me like that makes me want to stay. Because I can't hurt her with that. You know what I mean. I'm 21 now and so glad I didn't end my life back then. Or even the attempt of last year. I always got away stronger. The fact that you come here asking for help is just your mind finding a way out of this spiral. Let it find its way out of the dark. Please."
mentalhealth,fc444a0,t3_eg2y8g,1577406130.0,"Is there someone else in the family you feel comfortable talking to? Maybe that can help if it only is a listening ear. You know what I mean?
I'm having the some problem with maintaining friendships. When I finally find someone who I feel comfortable with and can laugh with then I can get a little obsessive or claim them for myself so they won't leave me. And I'm still struggling with that. Making friends is not the problem it's keeping them that's hard for me. So I feel with you on that matter.
Also I find it brave to speak up in here, that way it might take away a little stress with keeping this all in your head and now you've sort of spoken up. So that's a good thing. If that works for you maybe you can find a organization that can help you via the internet. Like emailing a specialist when it gets too much or something. Idk if that's a real thing but maybe if you search on Google or something you can find things like that. But that's what I can think of if it's difficult to actually go to someone and talk about it. That could be the next step if you've found a way to communicate with a professional in the mental health field. Idk I'm just trying to think of ways to help you.
Let me know what you think about this idea. Or if you just want to talk hit me up. Goodluck."
mentalhealth,fc43c99,t3_eg34ih,1577405546.0,"Well you've got a point because when depression really hits you it is most likely to come backm but I think (my opinion) is that it might indeed not go away or can get cured but maybe you just learn to live with it by analyzing some situations and not make the depression feelings get worse. So maybe it'll not go away but you just learn how to cope with it. Also antidepresants can work backwards like I've had. My depressing feelings and thoughts just got worse with that garbage. But it might help someone to take the edges of and live with it.
Idk if this all makes any sense but yeah kinda get your point tho."
