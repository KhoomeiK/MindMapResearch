Anyways...Sadly your own friend has betrayed your trust...And just like other commentators here already said I think the best way for you is to set out some boundaries, basically be wary of her from now on, by not sharing this info to here anymore, as she can't be trusted to not spread it...It's gonna be awkward for a few days, but after a while you can resume your friendship and continue having fun at least, if that's what you want...If you feel she has betrayed you, you could simply treat her with kindness and not seek out further outings with her...Also you could try to explain to your husband that you simply shared this info to a person you thought you could trust, so they could provide you with a helpful insight/solution, as sometimes we can't make rightful judgement when all we can think about is how we perceive the issue and how it just impacts us."
