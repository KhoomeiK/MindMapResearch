Anxiety,fg6dttk,t3_ex4y3y,1580564984.0,"Step 1: put the booze down. I am not saying to quit drinking completely, or even at all. But hear me out: I used to rely on alcohol so much as a crutch for social interaction that even if I hit it off with someone while intoxicated, one of us would quickly realize that, while sober, there was nothing of *substance. * And again, nothing in your post is suggesting that you have a bad relationship with alcohol or that you even use it as a crutch like I did, but the best relationships, the ones where I felt deep strong connections, we’re not centered around drinking as a hobby. People I met drunk usually ended in a dumpster fire. It’s really fucking hard to do considering drinking is widely considered as a social activity, but it’s love your looking for, not lust. If you manage to snag a first date, aim for a brunch, hike, coffee, something where alcohol cannot be a safety net for either of you to fall back on. 

Step 2: Keep putting your authentic self and your *passions* out there. I’m 30 last year, fat, have shitty long hair, glasses and spend a majority of my free time playing League of Legends and World of Warcraft. Right now I probably fit the stereotypical “fat gamer nerd” mold, even though I don’t see myself that way because I’m in absolute denial. I work a slightly-better-than-retail retail job. I do not have a degree, have had more jobs than I can possibly list, but I’m content. And the difference is that I stopped measuring my idea of success against what success meant to other people. Success for me right now is being able to eat my shitty fast food once a day and unwinding at the end of my day with video games. Is it healthy? No. Is it sustainable long term? No. Do I recommend you have the bar set as low as I do for success? Probably not, but that is what works for me right now and is allowing me to live each day without actively wanting to kill myself so I’ll continue to do it until I redefine success for myself, not anyone else. 

I’ve been living with my girlfriend now for two years and it’s the best thing to ever happen to me. But I found her by laying all my flaws out there and not pretending I was anyone other than me. I shared my struggles with depression, anxiety, body image issues, lack of financial stability...all of my shitty qualities, you name it. She was not the first person I tried to be vulnerable with; many others just peaced out or were not here for my bullshit and yes, it hurt to be rejected for being me. I swiped right unabashedly for months, years even. It was more of a chore than it was a search for love. It was the only way I could meet someone though because I have agoraphobia and really need a damn good reason to leave my house. But now I am of the object of her unmitigated love. Now my measurement of success is slowly moving upwards. I am now more successful than I’ve ever been and that has nothing to do with money or what books tell you being successful is. I will never have the financial freedom to take baller ass vacations or buy a dope house or a car. Maybe her and I will live in a one bedroom flat/apartment for the rest of our existence. All of that is okay, because success for me was wanting to live every day, wanting to live for her. And I’ve achieved that.

You will be the object of someone’s unmitigated love. You are worthy."

For instance, the ending to Disarmed is wonderful, but the song on a whole doesn’t do it for me. Words in the Water, Treading Paper, and Anthology are my favorites and to me the most cohesive. Still adore the album, but not as much as I thought I did on release. You can definitely feel the grief and the release of it on it, and I appreciate that though."
Agoraphobia,ffxxbd6,t3_evtom5,1580334249.0,"I’ve taken Xanax and Ativan as needed over the past four years. Xanax will most certainly chill you out or stop a panic attack from happening. I would recommend if you get a prescription for it to try and first take one in a safe place, whether that’s home or even if you know you can be away from your desk/job for a half hour or so, just so you know how it effects you. 

If I take one when I feel like I MAY panic, it tends to make me pretty fucking tired straight up. However, if I take one DURING a panic attack, it does not make me tired and just makes the worry/panic subside. 

I’m like you and don’t have an issue with addiction, but I can recognize how fucking good Xanax makes me feel and can see why people easily become addicted. 

As far as other side effects, I had none aside from feeling emotionally numb and tired. I think as long as you are taking the prescribed amount responsibly, you shouldn’t have an issue."

If you’re watching the health bars in the portraits more than the physical map and action, you can easily make the wrong decision on who to TP to because you lack so much information about what is actually happening. Being able to click on a portrait doesn’t allow you to gather the information necessary to make the best decision. Looking at the physical map does, and at that point, you’re already looking at the hero so just click the hero.

I still occasionally panic while smoking because I think it’s just in my DNA to overreact when I feel any slight change to my body and THC can definitely exacerbate those feelings.

I’ve been using medicinal cannabis for close to a year now and the first two months was me taking Verano 14:1 relief tablets (or troches??). I would take one in the morning and one at night, and the CBD also helps lower that paranoia feeling when the euphoria kicks in.

“Act normal.” This is just belittling.
