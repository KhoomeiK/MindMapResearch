depression,fqtjguz,t3_gkn8ng,1589640210.0,"On the 28th of August 2019, I committed Suicide by overdosing on specific pills that should definitely kill me, the only reason I am still alive right now was because my friend saved me. I lost all my friends and I lost everything in my life. I had to start new, Literally everything new and it did kind of work out. Until now, I got back stabbed my the person I thought would never do such thing, bullied, cyber bullied and also received life threatening message and people wishing me dead. Now I’m losing everyone again, I bet just a bit more of loneliness will drive me crazy to commit suicide, but this time, I’ll jump off the roof, from a 35 story building making sure I do definitely die.                                                   Maybe I’m closing to doing it, there’s nothing to live for when everyone and everything is against you."

But what hurts now is that he back stabbed me and I hate my fucking life, I hate being alive right now. I used to have people to care but now they all wish I am dead and hate me. All the cuts, burns, scars on my body make me look like a freak in public, and at the end no one cares. And the most hurtful pain is that those who used to care hate you now and don’t care about at all."

I use it every now and then, so try it mate, and I hope it does Help you."
depression,fpn0vyz,t3_gea6mo,1588746928.0,"I feel your pain buddy, I feel it completely. What’s worse is that you had a Best friend, more like a brother but your dumb ass Depression fucked things up, messed it up and just destroyed everything because of being stupid and a fool. 
This is the worst feeling that will hunt you down everyday you live and will make your life a living hell and just make you feel guilty all the time that you just want to kill yourself. And if you don’t kill yourself, then your guilt will, or your conscious would have snapped and just made you do it. 
Life sucks and it’s a living hell. And losing your best friend who was more like your brother is the most painful thing you can live with. That will eventually kill you."

I’ve got many friends, but I guess they only talk to me when they need something from me. Nothing of once had they talked to me and just asked how I was doing or anything of that matter. 
It hurts being treated like shit, it hurts being used, it all hurts, and if you do one simple mistake, that is the only thing you had done to them, beside all the gifts and love you gave them. 
And the worst part comes in when your parents hate you, neglect you, you aren’t their favorite child although you have the best marks and the best attitude in public. 
It all hurts."

If you posted something of yourself, you’d have those fake friends of Social Media support you while they talk behind your back. And After a while of posting that picture, you are going to remove it because you feel disgusted every time you open your profile and notice just how messed up you are.

Staying home is at least one good thing for us who are depressed, no more social contact, no more seeing people who dislike us, who hate us. At least now we are going to be resting from all that. But there is a nice thing about it, we stay home, locked in our rooms and no one can disturb us. We stay in our dark rooms which we call our caves and dens. 
Enjoying our self time and that’s what we want. 
And the good thing is that we can go out in the dark and walk in the park where no one is there to see us or to judge us.  
And if it was raining, it becomes even better, we can cry about something and no one can notice our tears falling hurting us as they come down our cheeks. 
That’s one point to consider 😔😔"
