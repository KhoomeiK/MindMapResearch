depression,fqe28xv,t1_fqdrs1r,1589300570.0,"I'm not even on anyone's radar.. I'm a genuinely nice person, I might not be the best at expressing it so I'm mostly quiet, but I feel as a defense mechanism I put off a vibe of ""don't talk to me"" because I'm afraid of being too awkward. As a result, people seem to not like me at all. What hurts the most is while I was in college, I felt like I was surrounded by people I could've gotten along with and even had some good times in class chatting in a group of people, but now 2 years after graduating, I haven't heard anything from those people and even notice a few unfriended me on Facebook.."

depression,fq9yw9u,t3_ghdi7l,1589209731.0,"I think I've been on both sides, but it's hard to tell given my dgaf personality. I could have perhaps spent a large chunk of my life suppressing my depression, by fooling myself into believing I was happy with my life. (a lot of my depression now stems from past problems so that could be the case)

regardless, being someone who can bounce back and forth between manic and depressed, when I'm on a high I still have those thoughts like ""how was I so depressed, it doesn't make sense"" yet a week later, I'm not strong enough to shower or eat, and I think ""I don't remember a time when I was happy""

it's all mind tricks and even knowing you've been both places, it's still hard to recall the feelings once they've passed."

The way they feel has been my mentality for over a year so quarantine didn't really change anything for me. if anything, it was more of a relief not having to go out and pretend I wasn't already feeling lonely and isolated."

AskReddit,fpvw2e0,t3_gfsi0q,1588952868.0,"As a child and teenager, I experienced a lot of unexplainable phenomenon that I couldn't find a logical explanation for. I will share a few:

When I was about 10, I was sleeping in bed one night and woke up to go to the bathroom. while in the bathroom, I heard a voice from overhead say ""this is your mom speaking, will you come outside and help me in the garden?"" it was 3am and my mom doesn't garden. again a few months later, I was laying in bed around 11pm with my eyes shut. my little sister came by my bedside and asked me to go outside and play, but I told her no, go to bed. I then opened my eyes to see a girl (not my sister) walking out of the room, and kind of disappear as she got farther. 

When I was about 12, midday I was cleaning my room. I had a little plastic tube of stringed beads (the kind you hang in front of a doorway) sitting on the top shelf of my closet. Suddenly the tube, which was securely placed towards the back of the shelf, knocked over and half the beads flew across my room, hitting the back wall about 12 feet across from it, as if someone chucked them across the room. 

When I was 15, I was talking on the phone with my boyfriend around 8 or 9 pm, when I heard a train outside and saw a bright light shining into my room. The train was so loud I started yelling over it just so I could hear my voice. I said ""holy hell do you hear that, it's so loud!"" of course he didn't hear anything. It was getting louder and the light, brighter, as if the train was heading right towards our house. I jumped up and looked through the blinds and it all instantly stopped...

I have many stories like this from my younger years with no explanation. I have considered schizophrenia, but there's never been a single case of it in my families. I'm currently 27 and haven't experienced anything unexplainable in 5 years."
depression,fpvrboj,t3_gfqlvd,1588950406.0,"Yes! And it's new for me too. I've had depression for 13 years, but only in the last year have I experienced this. I have absolutely no attention span, my brain fog is so thick I can almost visibly see it, and I'm also experiencing short term memory loss when it comes to work."
