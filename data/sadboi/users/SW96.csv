I was raped and assaulted multiple times by my ex-girlfriend, who is also trans. It took me over a year to even feel comfortable looking for a partner. My current girlfriend is so sweet and supportive, but I know deep down that I'm not quite ready for sex. I'm too scared. Consider telling your partner what you're going through if you feel safe and ready. It's certainly helping me heal more quickly. Our pain is real. We both need time and space to learn to feel safe again, and that's OK. It doesn't make you worthless. It means you're facing down some really tough shit. Rape is terrifying, and you don't need permission to work through that trauma on your own terms. I'm glad you're still here. Please stay safe."
rape,fclh1ij,t1_fckua85,1577747605.0,"Fuck, that's... way too real. I didn't want to believe my girlfriend was a bad person, much less a rapist, so I became everything she wanted me to be. The more she hurt me, the more I had to convince myself that I was in control and this was what I wanted, too. And because she isolated me emotionally from everyone I cared about, she was the only person I could go to after she hurt me, which created this codependent feedback loop. I thought that would numb the pain of the truth, but it didn't. I convinced myself that something about her just brought out this raging sexual desire I never really had before, and just so happened to involve giving her whatever she wanted. If she wanted sex, I gave it to her and I liked it. I had to. If I didn't, she'd have gotten what she wanted anyway. I think she knew that I knew that. If I didn't internalize that before she raped me, I sure as shit did after. The first couple times we had sex, it started as this creeping anxiety that I wasn't satisfying her because she was so experienced and I was a virgin. When she crawled on top of me and kissed me and groped my boobs while I was asleep, I thought that was just how some people initiated sex, so I went with it to make her happy. When she forced her tongue inside me after I told her not to, I let it happen as long as I could bare to try and convince myself I liked it, also to make her happy. By the time she accused me of not trusting her because I wanted to use a condom, well, I realized deep down that that was fucked up, but at this point I'd also realized that anything I had to say about it would be lost on her. So I swallowed my fear of STD's, got high, and told her I wanted it. That was consent to me. Giving her head is pretty tame compared to that, but on some level I still feel like I had to do it. I don't think I would've realized this if you didn't share your story. Thank you."

The day I left, I nearly missed my flight because she robbed a Target and I had to spend two hours getting her back from loss prevention. She accused me of not trusting her because I called my mom for help. I was so under her spell that I didn't realize what was wrong with what she did to me until a month after we broke up. I defended her robbing Target to my mom. It all felt normal."

rapecounseling,f4u5zwx,t1_f4l5tek,1571800039.0,"""Deprogramming"" is actually a really helpful way to think about it. Thank you for putting it this way, and thank you for sharing your story as well. My relationship with my rapist is my first and only experience with sexual violence, but still she was able to plant so many fucked up ideas in my head about how people can/should treat me, and in so little time. I've kinda had to reteach myself boundaries from the ground up because of her. I was just so hurt that I really did have to start at square 1 socially, romantically, and sexually. I think having to rebuild myself that way has made me a lot more sure of what's OK and what isn't, just cause I was forced to take stock on all those things just to feel normal again, y'know?

But that apparently also means I get that much more shaken up when I look back and realize something else that happened to me wasn't OK. It makes me wonder whether all the work I've done on myself was legitimate, if I thought it was acceptable for someone to treat me that way. Like... what other latent traumas could be guiding my behavior without my knowing? This whole thing has just really shaken my confidence..."
rapecounseling,f11vetv,t3_d66hmk,1569131074.0,"I relate to this a lot. Over a year later I *still* obsess over whether it's appropriate to call what happened rape. I was pressured and guilted into having unprotected sex until I lied and told her I wanted it. I was so guilty and just wanted her to stop pressuring me. Still though I just can't get over the fact that *technically* I said yes. It's a rabbit hole of what if's and it's so easy to fall down.

For what it's worth, when I get caught in one of these loops, what helps me is to stop and ask myself ""Would it have been legal for me to sign a contract under these circumstances?"" The answer in both our cases would be no, because neither of us had sex purely because we wanted to. That's what rape means.

Rape is always thought of as something that only happens to other people, partly because survivors are so stigmatized but also because rape is just that horrible. My brain tells me that it must have been something else, no matter how clear-cut it is to other people that I was raped. I think that's how it tries to protect me, but it's just wrong. I hope this helps."

To one person, forgiveness might entail letting go of their fear and hatred so they can move on with their lives. To me, though, forgiving my rapist would mean absolving them of suffering that overwhelms me to this day, and will probably hurt me on some level for the rest of my life. I can't do that. I let them get away with too much to let this slide, too, and the hope that someday they'll get what's coming is a very powerful motivator.
