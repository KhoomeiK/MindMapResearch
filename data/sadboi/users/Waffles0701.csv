bipolar,fipukyi,t3_f93n5c,1582622160.0,"Hey,

Firstly, thanks for sharing. You have no idea how much you might help someone just by sharing your story. 

Secondly, welcome to the family. Bipolar is almost as unique as fingerprints - everyone has their own version, coping mechanisms and triggers and we are all stumbling through this together. 

I lightheartedly refer to my bipolar (I‚Äôm bipolar 2, diagnosed for 11 years now) as me missing the binding ingredient in the baked goods that is my head. It is what it is, some days are better than others. I wouldn‚Äôt call someone with diabetes or coeliac disease broken, and bipolar is just the same. You are not broken. 

Medication can take a while to get right. Just because this first one isn‚Äôt working or you doesn‚Äôt mean the others won‚Äôt. You‚Äôre on a journey now and you just have to keep trying. Just because the first pair of shoes don‚Äôt fit, doesn‚Äôt mean you should walk around with bare feet! 

Being self aware of when you‚Äôre snapping and in a high/low is seriously a blessing. Taking accountability for your actions is a skill. It‚Äôs really hard, but it‚Äôs worth it for the tolerance you gain from others and yourself."

I have both of these too. First and foremost, I‚Äôm so sorry you were treated the way you were. That shit sucks. 
I‚Äôm not here to make excuses. You‚Äôre completely right - everyone needs to own their shit behaviour, whether they have a valid reason or not. Everyone is accountable for their actions. That said, it can be really difficult to open up to people. Vulnerability is a huge thing, often leading us to a lot of emotion (which can be scary!) so we take the other road where be harden everything and push everyone away - potentially causing a low or relapse in itself, which is just the worst. 
I really hope your friend realises how valuable you are, however I really want to reassure you that not everyone who suffers these disorders is like that."
