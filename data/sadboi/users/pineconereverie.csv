I feel like when I mention those symptoms it gets brushed over because she either doesn't seem to think it's important to deal with or doesn't know how to help me deal with it.
Anyway, it's helpful to see others have had similar experiences and found that EMDR was beneficial. I know therapists are trying to help, but it's frustrating that they do more harm sometimes by not addressing unresolved trauma and not referring clients to someone who can."

I have to remind myself that my feelings are valid, no matter what caused them or what triggered them to rise to the surface, and it's probably a sign that the event being discussed was more traumatic than I gave it credit for, and I've been stuffing emotions for a while. Therapy is one of the safest places to let that stuff out. Also leaving therapy can feel very raw, and sometimes I just need a good cry afterwards. 
It also helps that my therapist just silently offers me the tissue box and has even expressed her own condolences on my experiences, validating how difficult it has been."

It's really relaxing to tap out a beat, especially since I tap on things anyway.

therapy,euci9gd,t3_cfqhn5,1563675881.0,"There's a difference between seeing a counselor who happens to be a Christian, and going to a Christian counselor (sometimes under a Christian counseling service). I've seen exclusively Christian counselors in the past and they've also asked me when I started whether it was okay to counsel me from a Christian perspective, whether they could pray with me at the end of a session, things like that. You can ask the counselor about this. The foundational techniques and psychology behind Christian counseling are essentially the same as a secular counselor. I tend to be pretty progressive in my thoughts within Christian circles but have never had an issue with any counselors. They are there to help you heal, not to judge you over your beliefs or lifestyle. They may try to guide you away from dysfunctional or destructive lifestyle patterns, but that's a matter of helping you live better for your own sake, which I would hope is the case with any therapist. I can't really recall any past therapists throwing Bible verses at me out of condemnation - only a few times have they quotes passages to remind me of encouraging truths that I am loved, valuable, redeemable, etc. 

Regardless of religious beliefs, not all therapists are a good fit, and that's okay too, especially depending on the type of counseling or therapy you might need. There aren't necessarily taboo topics in therapy but, for example, some women who have experienced sexual abuse are only comfortable seeing female therapists, or if there has been severe emotional trauma sometimes people need to seek out a therapist who specializes in trauma healing, that sort of thing.

Don't be afraid to give it a shot. Therapy can be a little awkward at first anyway(at what other time are you ever given a whole hour where you're supposed to talk about yourself??), but see how you feel overall after a few sessions. Is he listening and really trying to understand? Do you feel comfortable sharing the things that are really eating at you? Are you leaving your sessions with some new tools for coping with those things and going home with a little more hopefulness than before? Realize it might take some time for you to be able to open up more, but if you keep going and you don't really feel heard or able to openly share, or if something just isn't clicking, don't be afraid to look for other options in your area.

Best wishes."

therapy,eubu00x,t3_cfpqcl,1563656988.0,"My impression has always been that these kinds of things should be addressed in session. My therapist doesn't give out her private number and her answering machine says to call 911 or go to an emergency room in a crisis situation. I go on the assumption that during regular work hours she is with other clients or doing paperwork, and that the rest of her time is her own.
In my opinion those boundaries protect the therapist as well as the client, since the purpose of therapy is to help you get to a point where you have the tools to process these things on your own with the help of your own support network.

I absolutely second the recommendations made in this thread to write down what triggered you, what you're feeling, what thoughts are running through your head, and to make a note to address this in your next session. It's also completely reasonable to call and try to move up your session to an earlier date if you're struggling to make it to your next appointment. I tend to be against contacting a therapist outside sessions except to schedule/reschedule, but that comes from the boundaries set up by previous therapists and watching others develop an unhealthy dependency on counselors who made themselves too available where it ended badly when boundaries finally had to be enforced. I don't know the specific type of therapy you are getting or the dynamics your therapist has set up. If you are wondering this then it's probably worth asking your therapist whether it's okay to text them between sessions to note something that comes up you'd like to discuss in session, or if there's something your therapist recommends to put a pin in that to address later.

You brought up a really good question, and it shows that you're sensitive to your therapist's personal life and responsibilities."

If she continues to berate you like this you could file a report with the local police for harassment.

It sounded common and he didn't seem concerned enough to have me tested for POTS. 
I don't think MS was mentioned as a consideration, but I don't notice any muscle spasms or tingling that are described as common symptoms. I think they are considering RA also but are waiting x ray results and I don't notice any visible joint swelling. They want to schedule an MRI for my hip (which is by far the most painful/troublesome joint) and I'll have a follow up in about a month with the rheumatologist to discuss the results.

I'm afraid censorship isn't the answer for either side of the gang stalking issue. Please hear me when I say I completely agree that a large portion of gangstalking victims are actually suffering mental illness, but you cannot rule out actual gang stalking in every case. My family and I experienced perhaps a more mild form of gang stalking in a small town. Friends and family witnessed it as well, we documented what we could. It broke my mother's spirit, though she's been to therapists and no one has ever even suggested a severe delusion like schizophrenia.  I chose to move out and not allow their bullying to affect me, but it did happen. I can't deny years of physical evidence, observation, and documentation. 

This group can create an extremely unhealthy feedback loop for people already suffering mental illness. Let's not overlook that. But every adult is responsible for their own decisions in choosing to participate in this group. Her participation in this group may have been a factor in her death, but this group is no more responsible than you are or anyone else. I know that's not what you want to hear, but if people in this group are schizoeffective as you say, then trying to convince them that gang stalking is a delusion will only solidify their belief that it's real and that you're either part of the blind masses or part of the conspiracy to cover it up.

I'm deeply sorry, but I don't think posting here will accomplish what you want. I wish you the best and hope you are able to find healing."
AnxietyDepression,et4y1or,t3_c9xg20,1562459922.0,"First of all, it's not true that you'll never achieve intelligence, that's a self defeating lie your brain keeps telling you. It sounds to me like you're pretty smart if you are self aware enough to recognize you're not happy with the way things are and actively want to change that.

I'm going through this now. I thought about moving, but I realized I had some healing to do here before moving on and logistically it's just not an option for now. Basically how I started over was I had a funeral for myself. I went camping for a few days where I couldn't get service most of the time so I wasn't distracted, and took time to reflect on where I had ended up in life and what I do and don't want to be. I realized that parts of me had metaphorically died off some years ago and I've just been hanging on, so I took time to mourn those things and the relationships that were holding me back and had hurt me along the way. I decided that I wasn't bringing that old me back when I went home. I've inherited some bad habits and coping mechanisms from her, but I feel like I have the fresh start and perspective to continue growing and healing. Part of my plan is to implement some new activities to get me around different people so I don't feel stuck between being alone or hanging out with the same toxic people as before (not that you have to cut out people entirely, but I'm creating more distance without being rude to them). It doesn't immediately solve my problems or magically transform me, but it gets me into the mindset of being able to slowly transform myself as I actively begin to change my thoughts and behaviors.

I also deleted all but one social media account and deactivated all accounts on other platforms. This was for several reasons: it was symbolic for me of a new start (I may reactivate them later when I'm in a better headspace but I'm giving myself at least a month and so far I don't miss it), I rarely posted but when I did certain people were very nosy about the ""with whom/when/where"" of whatever I did out of curiosity even though in person they didn't care how I was doing, the comparison game was making me extremely anxious and depressed, and I wasted way too much time mindlessly scrolling when I could have been doing things that would better my mental health. The one account I kept is one that gives me a creative outlet and lets just a select few friends stay up to date on my life, and I even went through that and purged my friend lists first.

Also I've been in therapy for a few months, and there's just no getting around that. Even if you change your name and move, you'll carry with you all your past experiences and your worldview filter that tells you how to interpret and respond to everything around you. Most of us don't have super healthy filters, and the only way to really ""clean"" off our lenses is to have someone else help us see where the smudges are and give us the right tools to clean them. Even the best of friends or mentors usually aren't taught how to equip others with those tools, which is why therapists are really the best option in most cases, especially when you're asking how to start over essentially.

As for day to day things, maybe change up your routine to include something that can become a new tradition for the new you. Getting out of your normal environment can also help - go explore a different park or hang out at a different cafe than your usual hangout. Make it personal to you and what your transformation goals are. Outward changes don't fix the problem but they help prep your mind to do the work on the inside.

ministry,er5wole,t3_c0m54z,1560535037.0,"Actually, I appreciate when ministry leaders recognize and openly acknowledge that these areas can be sources of pain for many individuals.

Of all places I find it frustrating that in the church we feel like we have to pretend like holidays are the happiest times and must be for every individual, or else we might somehow rain on someone's parade.

I wouldn't find it odd to make that kind of prayer on Pastor Appreciation Day. I would feel relieved that someone in a position of authority recognizes that spiritual abuse in the church is rampant and leaves many deeply wounded as a result.

I don't think it should necessarily be forced into some awkward prayer, unless that's the person's honest prayer. For the most part if I remember correctly when our pastor has made statements like this it is outright to the congregation.

Saying these things doesn't necessarily heal someone, but it is a welcome balm just to have that pain recognized and validated by someone else, which can make room and a safe place for healing to start."

I would treat it as others suggested, like ringworm, but also be watchful of early lyme symptoms like muscle aches, stiffness, flu-like symptoms, and general malaise within the next few days and weeks."
Gangstalking,eqq6evx,t3_bz41i9,1560213312.0,"I can appreciate what you're saying, but this is not the appropriate way to communicate that by invalidating individual's experiences without any knowledge of what they're going through. Hear me when I say that I agree that paranoia and schizophrenia can absolutely contribute to what people experience as gang stalking, but that does not explain away every single case. My family was gang stalked. We had friends witness it, and I saw some crazy stuff growing up, and a lot of it we documented, photographed, or videotaped for proof. Absolutely terrified my mom, and she grew more paranoid and distrusting as a result of already existing gang stalking issues. There was no huge government conspiracy against us; it was just a small town, good old boy network of adult bullies determined to make our lives miserable there. And they did a damn good job of it.
In all honesty to make such a blanket statement like that is incredibly ignorant. Some people do suffer mental breakdowns because of the trauma caused by gang stalking, not the other way around. Again, hear me - I'm not ruling out delusions and disorders in some cases, but you simply can't say that all gang stalking is basically a myth. I wouldn't have believed in it until my family experienced it."

Christianity,eq17vjs,t3_bwqshj,1559703022.0,"I'm so sorry you're going through this. There really is no cut and dry solution for your situation, no matter what anyone might say.

Have you ever been able to get her to identify why she refuses to take advantage of the abundant resources you've placed at her disposal? Has she suffered significant abuse or trauma in the past that she fears digging up? Since you and the doctor have been pretty frank with her, have you asked her what she needs in order to be able to take steps toward recovery? Sometimes this helps people identify something that they need in order to feel safe and supported to begin the healing process, and sometimes it may help them figure out for themselves that they have totally unrealistic expectations that someone will come along and solve their problems for them. 

There is certainly a strong incentive (at least in her distorted perception of reality) for her to not take advantage of the help she's been given or put any effort into long term change. Unfortunately, the books on demonology and similar topics are probably making things worse by encouraging her to place responsibility for her mental health on generational sin curses, oppression, demons, etc. It sounds like she is looking for a quick, easy, spiritual-sounding reason for her behavior as an excuse.

Have you been able to see a Christian counselor or a trusted pastor about this? Sometimes they can offer a new perspective, but I would be wary of the all-or-nothing pastor that thinks divorce is never okay...this tells me that they see the world in black and white and you're situation won't fit into either category, and they're likely to give very shallow or even hurtful advice. It's a real testing of faith when we're confronted with the fact that God allows a lot of greys in this world.

At this point it seems like you've done everything you can to offer her help, and she has to be the one to decide for herself that she needs to change. Maybe separating for a time might be beneficial first, to see if that drastic of a change would incentivise her to begin to make an effort. It might also give you some time to begin healing on your own outside the context in which you were hurt. I am concerned for your children staying in an environment like that. Speaking from experience - my mother exhibited similar behaviors growing up and refused to take ownership of her mental health and it became incredibly destructive within our family, even though my parents stayed together.

Again, I realise how difficult and painful an issue this is for you and your family, and I'm very sorry. You have my sympathies."
ministry,epzh10u,t1_epy1hs7,1559665506.0,"I'm glad what I said is beneficial for you. :) I don't really know much about this man's personal life and don't have the kind of relationship where I should know, since there are plenty of men in our church that can give him that kind of support and probably know more of his backstory.

Admittedly I'm still socially awkward sometimes, but not nearly as bad as I used to be. Part of that is growing myself and also finding safe friends that know my awkwardness and don't think less of me when I say something odd without thinking. A book that really helped me a lot was ""Safe People"" by Cloud and Townsend. I highly recommend any of their books, as they take a biblical approach to developing healthy relationships.

That's a good definition of humility. I would also add that it is not placing yourself above OR below anyone else in terms of value and worth. People make the mistake of making humility into the opposite of pride in that you have to degrade yourself and value yourself less than others. Right humility reminds us we all have equal value and worth in God's eyes."

We're going through this with our youth center ministry right now. The family running it has had multiple serious family illnesses to contend with and have been completely overwhelmed and burnt out the past few months with ministry responsibilities since there is almost no one able to consistently help. A few of us can help here and there, but I think the family is almost too aware of how exhausted they are and are afraid of burdening others with the same load and burning out someone else. I'm trying to challenge myself to learn to actually say no if it is too much instead of ""sure"" all the time. I've also challenged them by going over what they need from us exactly and offering a few specific things I'm willing and able to do to help and they have the freedom to ask those things of me whenever it's needed and I will do my best to fulfill those things or to be honest when I can't. I agree that finding help is often more organic and takes place observing others to see who is consistent and reliable and perhaps gifted in a certain way. Sometimes people simply don't realize there is a need when everything seems to be taken care of and no one directly says, ""we have this specific need and we think you would do great in this area."""

ministry,epy0v5u,t1_epx7q69,1559616113.0,"You bring up a really good point about shyness being in a way self-centered because of the focus. It comes from a lot of insecurity that makes people turn inward on themselves and overthink their every interaction. I find introverts are also inwardly focused in the sense that they seem to spend more time on introspection, but they also take a lot of time to quietly observe the world around them.

I agree that shy friends need to be encouraged to speak up for themselves. It doesn't happen as often anymore, and I do try to persuade them to do it themselves first. Sometimes it genuinely gives them serious anxiety and so I try to demonstrate that it's okay by my comfort with doing it.

I've thought about talking with the worship leader to see if we could practice with a metronome to make our tempo more consistent. I'm afraid the others may not think it's necessary and pressure the worship leader not to waste our limited practice time on it.

As for the other guy on worship, I'm not entirely sure why he left the previous church(es), but I don't get the impression he was kicked out. We are in a very small town where word gets around between churches very fast, and I don't believe our pastor and elders would tolerate him being in any of our ministries if he left on bad terms with his last church due to serious sin/character issues.

I don't mean for it to sound that bad. It's annoying and frustrating more than anything. I don't necessarily feel it's my place to try to get the worship leader or pastor to take action against him to get him removed from worship or anything like that. We're not really a church that often announces titles, so in our context it wouldn't be appropriate to announce a new assistant worship leader, since it's not really a position to begin with. I know I have more music experience and knowledge, but I'm wary of that desire to usurp someone's leadership role solely on the basis of ""I could do this so much better"" because it's very easy for me to puff up my own pride and become just as bad, even I don't behave outwardly prideful. As small as our church is, we only need one worship leader.

Our worship leader usually picks out the set list for the week, and if he's out of town, this guy just coordinates a practice time with us and prints the music. It's just in working out how to play the songs that he gets very picky and acts like he's more in charge of things. I don't mind him being on the worship team if he would just reign in his attitude and learn to defer to the skills and knowledges of the worship leader instead of trying to take charge in an area where he isn't very knowledgeable. We all offer input sometimes on how different songs are played or sung, it's just his manner of doing so and being adamant about his way being the only correct way even when we pull up the actual recording to show him. I'm not a psychoanalyst by any means, but I get the feeling he's prideful and controlling largely because he feels inferior or out of control in other more significant areas of his life. It doesn't excuse the behavior but gives me a bit more room to have patience with him.

I think if the pastor or worship leader were to remove him from the team completely that would just create a lot of hurt feelings and resentment without actually addressing his behavior in a way that he can hear. I don't like the church politics games, but in ministry the most obvious and straightforward solutions often cause the most long term damage by stepping on the most toes in the process. I think that's part of what it means to put other before ourselves and reign in our personal freedom in Christ for the sake of those around us. It seems like a simple solution to remove him from worship, but that might wound him in such a way that he is no longer receptive to anyone discipling him and helping him grow in this area.

I feel that our worship leader is in a better position to have a conversation with this guy, since they're both men, a little closer in age, and more close in life stages of having families, etc. He also has a pretty gentle temperament that I've observed, and could probably extend more grace than I would have the patience to do myself. I may bring it up with the worship leader if I get a chance and ask what he thinks, or if he believes it to be more of my issue to own up to and have the conversation with him myself. I see his frustration, but I don't know if he feels it to be a big enough issue to address or if he feels it's just the normal clashing of personalities in a group setting.

Thank you for saying that! I would hope I don't wear a mask, but I think the reality is that everyone portrays themselves a certain way in some contexts for protection against rejection or ridicule. I think in some cases there are people who are genuinely not safe people with whom to share yourself with, and it is safer and healthier to only share surface level things with them. The difficult part is discerning safe people who are healthy enough for you not to withhold deeper parts of who you are.

I was somewhat socially isolated as well growing up, so I understand it can be difficult to suddenly learn how to interact in a world where it feels like everyone got a head start in that department. If anything, the fact that you're self-aware of this gives you a good start in working through some of those things. I was pretty socially awkward with peers and it took a lot of ""failed"" awkward interactions and people looking at me like I had two heads a lot before I began to better understand and pick up on those social cues. It sounds like you're willing to develop and grow in those areas, just remember not to beat yourself up for the things you may not like in yourself now. We all should be striving for growth, but God has you the way you are in this stage of your growth for a reason."
ministry,epx3r33,t1_epwxr7v,1559591325.0,"Yes, I wholeheartedly agree. People don't know the difference between shyness and introversion, which is frustrating when I'm labeled shy simply because I don't feel the need or desire to speak up. I can actually be pretty vocal with closer friends, but for me that's just something others don't see until I take time getting to know them better. I actually was painfully shy as a child, but now I'm the one my shy friends go to when they are too afraid to stop the waiter to ask for something. Do you find that you've experienced shyness in the past and/or have developed more extroversion over time? I've found that I enjoy being around others more in the past few years than when I was younger, so it makes me wonder how much of your core personality can shift up and down the introvert-extrovert spectrum and how that changes how we serve others in ministry over time.

The older gentleman on drums doesn't mean any harm, but my pastor and worship leader both try to tell him nicely to pull back but he's just not that great on drums so he often speeds up significantly. He's a really sweet guy though, just not a great musician. Usually our worship leader can bring the tempo back down by leading on keyboard, but it's difficult when drums are supposed to be the driving tempo-keeper.
The other guy is more difficult, because he tends to act like the music expert because he taught himself guitar and played for another church before, forgetting that our worship leader went to college for music composition and has published books and has a whole separate music career on the side. He either passive aggressively or outright tells us we're doing something wrong when it's painfully obvious to the rest of us that he's the one that's off in some aspect. Sometimes we just have to placate him and do the song the way he wants because he is so insistent and takes up a lot of extra time at practice. He also has positioned himself to be the default worship leader when our actual leader is out of town, and that on top of me being a younger woman he doesn't take my corrections very seriously (I don't think he knows my level of training and that I've won some pretty prestigious music competitions in the past, which honestly just amuses me that he doesn't know and continues to puff himself up). I try to gently back up the worship leader when I can if there's a disagreement about how the timing goes or something like that, but the vocalists (if we have extra singers that week - sometimes we don't) and drummer don't care or know the song enough to chime in on how it goes. I can see the frustration on the leader's face though, and on others for him wasting time over really inconsequential issues.

I get what you're saying. There are certain contexts where I am more extroverted too. Not to make it like I'm putting on a mask or anything, but I would compare it to doing performances growing up. I was so shy the rest of the time, but there was a different mindset involved in performing where it was okay to ""play a character"" in a sense. I was comfortable performing where I wasn't in other interactions. I'm glad the God gives you the strength to stretch your personality so to speak in ways that you might not on your own. I think it's really cool how God gives everyone such unique personalities to be able to serve in so many different contexts and reach different people."
ministry,epwt1u2,t1_epwk8gv,1559583999.0,"Yes, I would like to suggest some kind of extra practice sessions to our worship leader, but it's very difficult for us to even find one hour a week that we're all available. Unfortunately, two of our team members are older gentlemen who aren't very receptive to critiques even from our worship leader and don't seem to recognize the significance of what he's saying to them, that things like counting out correct timing are absolutely basic and essential. In the end though, like you said, our congregation sings along and I doubt any of them even know even or care enough to pick apart those little glitches when we play.

I agree it's good to push yourself beyond your comfort zone, and I have definitely participated in areas of ministry that pushed me in a good way and I discovered they were more rewarding than I initially thought. However, I also know that there are other areas where I simply am not gifted and it wouldn't be beneficial for me or those I'm serving. There are people in our church with greater gifting and inclination toward those areas and they flourish in that, so I'd rather have someone else do those things well than be completely drained and eventually become resentful for forcing myself into an area of ministry that just isn't a good fit. I enjoy helping at one of our youth centers, but a lot of that is behind the scenes work that suits me much better than something like teaching in Sunday school.

I appreciate that you draw a distinction between introversion and shyness. I'm not all that shy, but I do prefer one on one or small group interactions that tend to delve into deeper subjects than surface level small talk. Typical church small talk on Sunday's is very draining for me even without the responsibility of being a greeter.

Funny enough, our pastor is an introvert, but I always marvel at how he can start up a conversation with anyone. I don't know how he developed that skill, aside from simply being in ministry for years."
ministry,epwjj1i,t1_epwh3dg,1559577421.0,"Thanks for sharing, but I would disagree. We operate very differently from a large church with many experienced musicians and lots of professional sound equipment. The last minute changes are not out of carelessness or failure to prep.

We get 1-2 of practice a week together simply because of scheduling, and that is usually sufficient as the songs are either familiar or easy to learn. Sometimes our pastor would like us to add a particular song or spend more time on one song. In a larger church context I can see this being more of a problem, but we are in a rural area with limited resources in terms of musicians. Myself and the worship leader are the only ones with any formal music training, and I've taken piano and music theory lessons for years. For us, things like beat and timing are second nature, but not to the others. They are mostly self taught and have more difficulty keeping a steady beat or remembering dynamics, but part of any music skill when playing in a group is being able to go with the flow and cover someone's mistake, rather than cause more disruption by plowing through the music the way it was meant to be played, even if those who ""messed up"" are on another beat or something.

 That takes focus to watch and listen to what everyone else is doing, and yes, that sometimes means focusing on the act of playing more than the personal worship so mistakes in the songs don't become a distraction from others trying to worship. If anything music ministry is a better way for me to serve than anything else because of my training of personality. I'm not really a kid person and am not outgoing enough for interacting with lots of strangers as a greeter, that would just be exhausting for me."
ministry,epw59hv,t1_epvdz2r,1559566189.0,"Haha I guess not, I just mean that Sunday morning worship music (for me) is more focused on remembering the dynamics for each song we practiced, keeping the beat, watching our worship leader for cues especially with last minute changes, that sort of thing.

I still wrestle with this a lot. On the one hand, it's difficult for me to enter into worship when I'm focused so much on playing the music and paying attention to the others on the team so that we're all in sync, but I also find that serving in that capacity gives me something useful and constructive to do. Playing music in general has psychological benefits to it, and our practices are  uplifting for me. When we're in practice I find I'm more relaxed and able to worship versus Sunday mornings when I'm trying to make sure I'm doing everything ""right.""

I ended up throwing up on my desk which was bad enough, but my teacher came around and yanked me by the back of my shirt collar and dragged me to the nurse's office to get cleaned up and wait to be picked up. I don't remember her even saying anything, and if she did it certainly wasn't anything comforting or reassuring.

I developed an actual phobia of getting sick at school after that to the point where I'd be so nervous I'd feel nauseous and tell the assistant teacher I felt sick most of the days I actually was in school. I'd get sent to the nurse, and the teacher and principle always commented in front of me that I was faking it. I threw tantrums almost every morning to not have to go to school, and some days my parents caved because they were just too tired of fighting and let me stay home. Cut to the end of the year and we ""graduate"" or whatever and she announces in front of the class how many absences I had and inserted some comment about how ridiculous it was. I was too young to fully understand her comments, just that I was supposed to feel embarrassed about how many times I missed school and about how often I felt sick.

Also she screamed at me once in front of the class for getting something wrong on a worksheet as she was passing by and looking over my shoulder. My friend and I once missed the whistle to call us in from recess and she didn't even go looking for us, we just got yelled at when we finally realized everyone was gone and must have gone back inside. She tried to diagnose over half our class with ADHD for being children.

Honestly, the more I learn of trauma the more i think everyone should be in therapy at some point in their lives. There are certain levels of trauma that sharing with a friend just isn't enough, and can make things worse sometimes if they don't know how to respond. Sometimes it really is a matter of a trained professional knowing how to validate one's experience and emotions and then offering healthy advice that makes the difference. It's also completely confidential unless she indicates that someone is in immediate physical danger. 
She's spent years bottling this up, so even counseling isn't going to make her pour out her heart overnight, but it will help her see that she's not in the same danger as she was in those abusive situations before. She needs to come to the realization that she has more control and more power over herself and her future by allowing those memories and emotions to come to the surface, processing through what happened and working towards healing. Bottling things is just one of many unhealthy coping mechanisms that give abuse survivors the illusion of control after feeling powerless for so long under their abusers. But it's just that, an illusion. It actually puts victims at a much greater risk of being abused again later in life and being depressed and disconnected from healthy, loving relationships.

It takes a lot of patience and compassion to watch someone go through this, knowing healing is possible if they would just take the first steps and reach out. Continue to encourage her that it might seem more painful initially, but her brain has lied to her for years and kept her locked away from the world, so any deviation from that is terrifying. But it is so rewarding and empowering to work through those past traumas and be able to break free from current or future abuse cycles being repeated.

It sounds like you've had some heavy burdens growing up as well. If you haven't already, you may want to speak to a counselor as well to process through some if what you experienced. Abuse survivors who haven't begun to process through their trauma and then become parents often project those dysfunctional coping mechanisms onto their kids. Personally, it took me years to realize how my own mom had actually been emotionally abusive and manipulative all because she hadn't worked through her own abuse. None of it was intentionally meant to harm me in any way, but the end result is garbage I have to work through too. Nature of the beast...abuse doesn't just affect the direct victim; it's like a contagion that infects everyone around. Some people just have different symptoms in varying degrees of severity.

Cops will most likely take you more seriously when you can show a consistent pattern of behavior like this. Maybe get in touch with the landlord as well and let him/her know the steps you've taken so far to address it with your neighbor first then with the cops with no change. Good luck"

Christianity,eoqgdy7,t1_eookbas,1558791440.0,"You're honestly just describing just different versions of ""read your Bible and pray more."" Like I said, I've already tried the spiritual to-do lists."
Christianity,eonxhgr,t1_eonltil,1558723997.0,"That takes a lot of strength to go back and work under someone who hurt you. I don't think I'm there yet but I would like to be one day. It's been months since things happened that affected our whole church and I get that a lot of people were hurt, but it's still very raw for me even though everyone else seems to have moved on. All my interactions are strained and even painful - it just hurts to be around certain people who made things a lot more painful for me along the way, even though I'm trying to stick around and invest in mending those relationships and get back to some sort of normal.
That being said, I think I will try to step back from ministry responsibilities as much as possible for a bit and see if that helps.
Thanks for sharing your wisdom."
Christianity,eonvmne,t1_eonu7a9,1558722672.0,Based on this response right here I'm glad I don't listen to crap advice like yours. Go back to your cult.
Christianity,eonns6o,t1_eolqs27,1558717119.0,"Yeah, it didn't always used to be like this at my church. Things have changed recently, and I don't know if people have collectively changed due to something that really affected and hurt our entire church or if I've changed and it's my perception of it. Still, I can't go to the people I once would have had more open conversations with about this kind of thing, and I'm trying to weigh whether that's something that can mend with time or whether I need to heal apart from this church."
Christianity,eongqy0,t1_eolrzb3,1558712113.0,"Thank you for the honesty in sharing. I needed to hear this. I do think I need a break from serving, and from my church in general for a bit, but I'm also afraid if I take a break from those things I won't go back. Like it will be too easy for me to pack up my wounds in bitterness and move on to somewhere else without ever really sorting through it, just collecting more wounds when the next group of Jesus-loving sinners does something that hurts me, intentionally or not."
Christianity,eonfak8,t1_eom1zfe,1558711091.0,"Absolutely not. This is so dangerous and unhealthy and unbiblical for so many reasons, and would only create more wounds and division. It would fail because the main motivator would be my own bitterness against those who wounded me. The fact that I still love those in my church is why their failures made such deep wounds. I want to be able to truly heal where I am, not find or start a new church every time someone apparently screws me over, because I'll forever be switching churches and avoiding necessary confrontation and accountability."
