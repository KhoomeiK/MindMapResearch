I was working only part time a few months before that and was so bored, not really doing much useful with my time except for going to the gym and tidying up the house. I guess I just realised I wanted to get more out of life, start doing things and stop wasting time consuming things (e.g. social media) just because it's easier. Because I can look back on the memories I've made and things I've achieved even in my spare time, rather than the time I wasted sat on my phone. It's definitely still a work in progress though but that's ok!"

And the worst thing is that there's only 4 people in our office and most of the time they're not always around so it's deadly silent, the only sound I can hear is her eating and I can't leave because I have to sit and do my work.

I'm not even working full time yet, still trying to figure out what I want to do in life but the idea of working that much with such little free time is terrifying.

Now I'm just going with the flow of life and trying to take the pressure off myself, but I would really like to grow as a person. For the last couple of years I really have struggled with my time management and procrastination, and this is something I really need to work on and to be honest with myself I haven't tried hard enough yet.

It's probably quite obvious but I would say more regular practice is the best way to help you, maybe look into getting a pole at home :) and lots of core exercises, even if you do 5 minutes of an ab workout everyday that will get you stronger. Finally, check that your form is right, a lot of people struggle to get their inverts and it's not because they're not strong enough, it's just they realise they're not doing it properly, I hope this helps :)"

In a weird way, although I don't feel like I've got things together at the moment, I'm enjoying seeing the little things slowly work out.

Check out tips on making your applications good. Try and get some volunteer work in the meantime to boost your resume and give you something to do. Pick up a new hobby or do some chores at home that you've been putting off for ages. And definitely go and exercise as it will really make you feel better! A job will come along for you, so many people remain unemployed for a while because jobs are hard to get but you will find something for you as long as you don't give up, I believe in you!"

Anxiety,etwjqto,t3_cds51g,1563273887.0,"Yeah this is absolutely me right now, I've been unemployed for a couple of months and every day I have of free time just makes things feel worse. I'm trying to occupy myself with things like exercising, learning new things, doing my driving theory test but I've lost the ability to go and socialise now. I've been at my happiest when I try and stay in a sort of routine though, wake up early and do some jobs that need doing and try to go to bed at a reasonable time. Also, I've realised how much time I waste on social media so I've switched most of it off for now and I would definitely reccomend this! My boyfriend has been telling me to appreciate all this free time because it's not often you get this, and it helps to try and put it that way. Relax and treat yourself a bit and also get things done that you've been meaning to do for some time!"

I've managed to overcome some little things, but I have had bad days too. It's all a journey, and you are taking all the right steps to helping yourself and that's all you can do.

But my boyfriend always tells me you're not on a clock and it's never too late to do anything, just do what makes you happy in that moment. There's no need to rush. You will always have the opportunity to complete school and complete your exams even if you're not doing it right now, but also you should try the apprenticeship if it's something you enjoy it might be so much better than you think! And if you don't like it you don't have to continue. Nothing in life needs to be set in stone for you, I've based my whole life around planning things and now I've ended up unhappy when things don't go to plan, when in reality we all need to just take things as they come"

It's just about trying to not let it get the best of you, but also not being too hard on yourself when it does sometimes"
Anxiety,epa7r3l,t3_bucj4y,1559123414.0,"I relate to this a lot, although I don't go to the gym. I do pole fitness instead but I haven't trained for months because I don't know what I want to train when I get there, and now I just don't have the energy to leave the house and go to class :( have you tried looking at fitness bloggers on Instagram/YouTube as they will post their workouts with numbers of reps and weights? Set yourself some goals eg if you're doing weights set yourself an aim of squatting a specific weight or something similar! You could have a day for training each part of your body and an overall workout day, write everything down so you know you have something to refer back to if you're feeling lost. I'm not sure how helpful this is coming from someone who doesn't gym but the fact that you have already gone back is really good!"

Your feelings are completely valid and normal, you're a human being with emotions and you just need to give yourself a pat on the back for even getting up in the morning.

I'm looking for a job but I don't know what I want to do and I'm scared of starting something new, so I haven't got very far only made a few applications. And I just feel so exhausted all the time that social plans and even time for my hobbies, when I know I have to leave the house, I just can't go do them.
