solotravel,fjda1uz,t3_fc1jeh,1583249010.0,"Hi I am 22 f, south asian muslim.

Places I've been before: January 2019 I went to Barcelona as a class trip. I wasn't too happy because we only spent 3 nights there, and I couldn't exactly go anywhere or see much even though I wanted to. It's complicated tbh lol. It is a beautiful place and we went to visit a university during the day. We stayed at a holiday Inn hotel.

Sylhet, Bangladesh in 2003 with family. I just stayed in a rural village area and can't remember much about it.

I haven't been to anywhere to live alone before so I am nervous. I haven't visited London before.

Interests:  anything! Activities/museums/historical or cultural things etc

Length: 
I will be going to London in from late may to June  2020 for a week to complete a work experience placement in Southwark. The dates haven't been finalized yet. 

Since I will be busy during the day, I think I can see London and do things from 5pm onwards. If I get a break during the day, I would also have some time to maybe get food.  I could also have a weekend free to do things.

Budget: it is a low budget. I would say probably Â£200- Â£900

Food- I can eat anything vegan/ vegetarian and pescetarian as long as it doesn't contain alcohol. If I eat meat, it has to be halal. I like trying food of different cultures though. I don't drink alcohol. 

Accommodation: I don't know where to stay but as I am a Muslim female who covers her hair, I'd be more comfortable staying alone. 

Transport: I'm the type of person who gets lost easily. I don't understand how the oyster card system works or what's best to do. 

If there is anything else I should add, please let me know 

Thank you"
