LockdownSkepticism,fqtzav2,t1_fqtd8i4,1589648983.0,"Hey, friend. Thank you for sharing this—I relate to you deeply from NYC! 

There is no amount of exercise, crafts, baking, or teletherapy that can help me anymore—those things are not replacements for economic and social security, or for the stability of a satisfying routine. I am actively and actually depressed, and desperate for a return to normal. I miss my friends and colleagues so much. I am beside myself over the response to this disease. I had gotten the depression and anxiety that tortured me in college under control, and was very happy... and now they’re back and torturing me again. 

After fifty days in my apartment (excluding walks to the bodega), I have to leave. I am going to be staying with family in the country starting next week. (Already had and recovered from CV, so I can’t hurt anyone or vice versa.) I’m a native New Yorker and will come back afterwards—I love the city and my job can’t be done elsewhere—but the longer this goes on, the less will be left, and that cuts me the fuck up. Small businesses, nonprofits, and museums are the lifeblood of this city, and they’re getting slaughtered. 

I have to say that I was permanently turned off of r/Coronavirus this morning. This article was posted and the overwhelming response was “*My mental health is better than ever because I’m antisocial and hate my colleagues!*” I don’t think their interpretations can be trusted with such a strong desire for lockdown animating their arguments."
BipolarSOs,fqtx5r9,t3_gkpskh,1589647824.0,"They can be. 

I will say that despite this being repeated often, my experience has actually been the opposite—people can tell when someone is hypomanic/manic, even if they don’t have any knowledge of the disease or any language to describe it. They know that person is “off.” 

I saw my exbpso alienate people at parties, on the street, at bars, etc., while hypomanic, but if you asked him about it later he would say that he and whoever he made uncomfortable were vibing, had a connection, had become friends, whatever. 

I think BP people self-report that they are charming in this state and it’s become an assumed fact, when in reality they are inappropriate, overbearing, and disorganized, with extremely dilated eyes. People can tell. It was horrible to witness and so sad."

- Do *I* want another child?

- Would I want another child if I were with someone else?

- Can I be happy foregoing further children? (I am the kind of person who would not and could not live without children, so I believe this is a really important one.) 

- Conversely, could I be happy with two children or would I be overextended?

- Am I afraid of having a BP child, or am I actually afraid that there will be increased chaos in the househould due to my *partner’s* BP activating more frequently under stress?

- How frequently does my partner help with the child we have?

- Conversely, is my BP partner’s illness so well managed that they would make a great parent and I’m underestimating them?

- Am I willing or able to investigate genetic counseling?"

My honest opinion? She seems insecure, selfish, and unstable--either she is like this by nature, or she's being improperly treated. (I mean, she even says she wouldn't stay with you if you ended up in a wheelchair, went to jail, or had some other calamity **because** she is ""selfish,"" her words.)

I recommend therapy to help you deal with these feelings of guilt and responsibility. A year is a traumatically long time for your partner to be irrational. I also think you will need a therapist to deal with the ""new him,"" as a hypomanic/manic phase lasting that long has grave implications for his executive and social functioning."
BipolarSOs,fq1fe7y,t3_ggfb4q,1589045166.0,"Hi hon. Respectfully, you're not thinking about this in the healthiest way. 

Medication is an absolute necessity for BP1. It is a severe mental illness with recurrent psychosis. No medication, no stability--period. Whatever he's told you about medicine is a lie (I assume the understanding of psychiatric medication & BP in your first paragraph come from conversation with him). This is a degenerative disease and will become more serious with time. You can expect increasingly frequent breaks from reality, cycling bouts of rage and paranoia, and escalting cognitive decline if he refuses treatment. 

Secondly, I see from your responses that you feel as if setting boundaries or leaving him would destroy his happiness. Understand that by refusing treatment he is destroying his own happiness. He cannot expect anyone to tolerate violently erratic behavior."

I really do think it's always better to disclose as soon as possible. People can surprise you, honestly. And if they know chronic mental illness isn't healthy for them to be around, or if they're self-aware enough to know they lack the patience and skillset to support you, then frankly, it's best for both of you to rip off the bandaid and keep looking.

BipolarSOs,fpt84qt,t1_fpt4dvi,1588886538.0,"No. She's in denial about the severity of her illness and wants the medications to be responsible for her psychosis and depression rather than her brain. 

This is not to suggest that taking these medicines are easy on the system, but there is no other option for a serious disorder like this, one that physiologically alters the brain.

A diagnosis is almost irrelevant, since he isn't interested in pursuing treatment. But to be frank, since he's *not* diagnosed, and not displaying the kind of total disorientation that would be recognized as active psychosis by emergency responders, no, there is almost nothing you can do to force him to get treatment. 

Have you considered he may just be abusive? It sounds like he hasn't valued your input or the perspectives of doctors for a long time. 

If you stay, he will hurt you. I do not advise giving him an ultimatum or trying to communicate your anxieties in any way, since it triggers explosive, manipulative rage. **Get out now.**

A few thoughts. Your mom might yet restabilize to a high level and recover more significantly! That can totally happen—it happens a lot! It's also a great idea, as Apandria mentioned, to gently suggest a med checkup based on negative side effects (flat affect, anhedonia, cognitive slowness--which, confusingly, I know, can also be symptoms of depression or of the decline brought on by the illness), if you and Mom have that kind of relationship. (Or you can tell your dad it’s a good idea.)

But also, get a therapist for YOU. You need someone to speak to, a compassionate professional who can help you navigate the new reality your family finds itself in. 

I’m not saying this to scare you or anyone else, but I do want to say I can relate: My exbpso *never* became the ""old"" version of himself again, and it truly was like a death. He is no longer witty, quick-thinking, creative, or even fully present, and he’s confused by simple things...  it’s straight up fucking horrendous. It is.

Not everyone can do it, because it is, by its essence, an insecure connection that may end in violence. It is such a sad truth, but it is the truth. So please be kind to both yourself and to her, as she's fighting a many-headed monster here. 

Some advice: Don't draw it out. That kind of theater is unfair to get. Mulisha is right that it will only lead to greater reliance on and attachment to you, when what will be most helpful to her long-term is actually honesty and a chance to develop greater self-reliance. Don't assume you can stay friends afterwards, either--that's difficult for people at the best of times, and she will need her bandwidth for managing her illness. And, again, it's important that she learn not to lean on you, for both your sakes. 

So, what do you do? It sounds like she's hospitalized right now. Have an honest talk with her a week or two after she's released, if she seems stable. Tell her that you need to step back, that you no longer have the mental or emotional space for a relationship--especially with the collective trauma of Covid-19 exhausting us all on the daily--and that you need space and time and a chance to recoup and, unfortunately, have to end the relationship.

BipolarSOs,fnmz2fo,t1_fnmhwfm,1587080992.0,I agree with Koi. Don't let these other people make the decision for you or you will end up without your belongings.
BipolarSOs,fnmlix8,t3_g2l990,1587073606.0,is she the BP party or are you?
BipolarSOs,fnlz38c,t1_fnlskaz,1587062248.0,"Agree. When Soapy describes her kids, she also describes me. I grew up in a chaotic environment with a mood-inconsistent father."
BipolarSOs,fnfm4cm,t3_g17vim,1586910785.0,"My friend, I remember you. I'm glad you still post here because I worry about you. This woman has cheated on you many times without remorse, and you are absolutely lost in her fog, ground down, and miserable. Please get therapy for yourself to determine why you accept this treatment. Be well and stay safe."
BipolarSOs,fna21md,t3_g01nfp,1586789503.0,"Unfortunately, yes, I came to that conclusion. Recurrent unmedicated psychosis can really change a person, and degrade their social functioning, self-awareness, role adjustment, and empathy to an appalling level. My exbpso was late onset, and everyone in his life tried to help him (valiantly, tirelessly), but ultimately his irregular commitment to treatment and inability to talk honestly about emotional damages to others has left him very alone. 

These are somewhat different situations as your insight is much better. However, I do think it's important for people with an extreme presentation of bipolar to understand that even if their abuse is influenced by the illness, to the person suffering from it, it's still abuse. It's up to you to find BETTER and more EFFECTIVE strategies with your care team so you can protect your partner. And it's important to accept that the choice to leave an unhealthy situation on your partner's part would be very valid."
antiMLM,fn4s2l5,t1_fn4020c,1586647740.0,"I understand what you're going for, but this is a really invalidating thing to spring on people when they're discussing their experiences."
BipolarSOs,fn3iv8r,t3_fyxhxf,1586621630.0,"I think, as Koi's answer shows, that all relationships with a BP person will involve intermittent periods of caregiving--which can escalate to full-time caregiving if they feel enabled to go off their medications and routine. 

If you are worried that you will lose yourself, lose perspective, or lose your health to caregiving--which I certainly understand--you may ask yourself if this type of relationship will really be healthy for you in the long run. In a relationship with a BP person, you have to be hyperaware of your own psychological makeup and be willing to protect your own mental health if necessary. My two cents."

BipolarSOs,fmjc9za,t3_fvjlwg,1586127385.0,"You're not his therapist. Understand, *only professionals can truly help him improve his mental health.* While your love and support is invaluable on a human level, you **should not feel guilty for or assume responsibility for his moods.** 

You are not doing anything wrong, and always trying to do more and more and more will end up with you becoming either an enabler or a carer (or both)."

Just know that nothing he says about you is true. I understand how it hurts and how it echoes, but it is his problem. It always has been. He chose to abuse your family by remaining unmedicated."

astoria,fmdp9oj,t3_ftcwgi,1585973858.0,"Keep in mind, COVID is different for everyone! I couldn't get a test, but my pulmonologist is pretty certain that I have it. Remember, 80% of cases are mild, and a not-insignificant proportion won't experience a fever. 

I have a pretty mild case. First, after twelve days of total isolation, I developed diarrhea; a few days later, a dry cough; then aches, muscle pain, one night of feeling too hot to sleep, chest congestion, and finally, fatigue. It comes in waves. You'll feel fine some days, and the next day you'll feel like you got hit but a mack truck--but I'm young and it's been manageable. Get mucinex, cough drops, and tea.

And ISOLATE YOURSELF. It could kill someone else!"

BipolarSOs,fm58kcj,t1_fm4uk8d,1585768312.0,"Hi Poesle! I'm not sure what you mean, but I see there's a kind of argument forming in the comments, so I'm happy to expand a little. 

This poster had a partner who seems to have suffered from narcissm, and was, obviously, quite abusive--I think it's clear the majority of her dysfunction came from *that* disorder. I sincerely hope he never experiences abuse like that again. 

I also don't see this subreddit as a space where we need to maintain a strict dominant narrative or false positivity--she also had BP, I'm sure that complicated things, and I'm sure he has, in turn, complicated feelings about that. He's entitled to those feelings, and entitled to express himself in this sub as someone who was the partner of a very ill person-- even if his personal conclusions are not what we all want to hear. Some people with abusive spouses may even really benefit from his openness; we don't know. I sincerely hope everyone feels empowered to share their story and process here."

I am sorry to have to add this, but I will warn you that cheating is almost always a reoccurring behavior if a BP sufferer is prone to infidelity when manic."
