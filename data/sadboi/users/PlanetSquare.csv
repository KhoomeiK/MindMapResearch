PurplePillDebate,fr5fv5z,t3_gmqwip,1589907881.0,"Alright well my answer was in the minority, so I want to explain my stance a bit more.

I'm a woman and I think futuristic sex robots would be a good idea. I'm also a lesbian, so the idea that men wont be interested in me anymore is actually a positive. If it became mainstream enough I would imagine that men who simply want sex would not bother me anymore, and instead if a coworker or classmate tries to form a friendship with me, it might actually be for friendship instead of a convoluted plan to get into my pants.

Though maybe it wouldn't really change much, because free porn is just a click away and yet men will still harass random girls for nudes, pay for strippers, secret snapchat and onlyfans even though it's all stuff they can get for free. I think people still crave the intimacy and feeling connected to another human being and are willing to go out of their way to obtain it even if it's as small as having your name called out when you tip the cam-girl.

Even if the sex-bots look exactly like a real woman, you will know it's not. Men don't even like fake breasts on a real woman, so if that woman is by design 100% fake, I think that would turn a lot of people off, or at least not be their preference. For those who are givers and enjoy just pleasing people, I don't think this would satisfy this desire since it can't really ""feel"" pleasure, it can only at best, trick us into thinking that it can by preforming it well, and that's only if we can turn our brains off long enough to be tricked.

I think it could be good for people that have extreme fantasies though. It's a robot so it could look like whatever you want, and whoever you want. There's a female comedian who even bought one to look like [herself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPPkK9zexvY). Furries, lolicons and those bad-dragon toys also come to mind. If you have a fetish that you can't really act on in real life, then getting a robot might be the best option for you. It could probably do things that a real body couldn't do as well like vibrate.

There are also people that already carry around their waifu body-pillows and sex dolls. It would be a lot less sad of a sight if their waifus could actually hold their hand and walk with them. Though maybe it would be a different kind of creepy to see a bunch of anime girls walking around in real life, I think it would make those people a lot happier.

I wonder if these sex-bots would be able to replace pornstars? The sex-work industry would be entirely shifted I imagine. In the video-game Detroit: Become Human they had basically a whore house full of sex bots, the selling point being that they can't get diseases and you can do whatever you want to them. Maybe couples could get them for their threesome fantasies.

I don't think people are going to stop having sex with real people because of sex-bots though. Chad will still get all the Stacies, and Stacy will still get Chad.  People will still crush on their teachers, coworkers, etc. Not everyone will be able to buy a sex-bot. It's a lot easier to hide a small sex toy than a full on human-shaped sex toy from your roommates, parents, children, etc. People are so caught up in the fantasy of having a sex-bot that I think they are forgetting about how impractical it would be for a lot of people. The world isn't going to become a dystopia where nobody is having sex or reproducing anymore like how some people imagine it will become once we have advanced sex-bots. It's just a sex toy at the end of the day, we already have tons of sex toys on the market that people claim feels better than partnered sex, and they still form relationships and have sex.

I personally probably wouldn't ever get a sexbot unless I lived alone, it was affordable, and provided an experience that was actually worth it. It's essentially just a sex toy that looks like a person and (I imagine) can preform all the sex-acts a person could. I would still want a relationship for companionship, intimacy and love. I suppose I could cuddle and watch netflix with the robot but to me that just sounds kinda sad. It can't love me or care about me or miss me when I'm not around. It doesn't have real emotions, it's just an imitation of real human behavior.  It would be cool if it could also double as a maid though.

tldr; Sex-bots are a good idea because it might appease the incels  and maybe that will make them stop creeping on random girls."

Maybe it wouldn't have mattered if you were Chad, maybe not, only Chad really knows. Focus on yourself, not what other people might or might not get. 

And I mean obviously you wanted what she was bringing to the table because you pursued her, so obviously you didn't really care that she had a lame job, a kid, and no home. Even if her nice ass is the only thing she was bringing, it was enough for you to not only try to get with her, but for you to still be upset about it after the ghosted you. I would suggest to just shrug it off. Don't even waste your mental real estate on being upset over it. There will be others. 

I also think trying with a coworker is different, since you are peers and it's not their job to chat with you. Working as a cashier though, your manager will get on your ass for not engaging in small talk and being friendly with the costumers. Also anyone who works in food service or anything that involved tips might be nice just so they can get higher tips.

For me, I actually really like children, and I want to have a family. I don't care if they are biologically mine or not, and in fact I would love to adopt and foster some children and give them a chance at having a loving family, but it's not something I want for another 10-15 years.

I'm 21 and a college student, and don't really make much money as I only work part time for minimum wage. Nobody really cares about how much money I make though. 

I think my league is basically average to maybe a little above average, so like 5's and 6's since those are usually the girls who pursue me. I could pursue a 7's and 8s but it's a bit more effort. I get the feeling that they are already used to a lot of attention and have a lot of people chasing them already. I get a lot of 5's and 6's who shower me in compliments and offer to take me out on dates and pay though, and if I wasn't so picky I could find one to form a relationship with very easily. I've never met a 9 or a 10 in real life as far as I remember, so they might not even really exist as far as I know.

I don't really consider anyone below a 5 as a possible mate. I also wouldn't date anyone who has children, gives off the vibe that they are promiscuous, has a boyfriend/husband, does drugs or drinks excessively. It doesn't necessarily take them from an 8 to a 5 or anything, if they are beautiful, finding undesirable things like that doesn't change that, but it eliminates them as a potential mate entirely for me."

It can become weirder as you get older though because it could be easier to use the fact that their brains are less developed to your advantage and there might be an unbalanced power dynamic and manipulate them. Though usually girls are grossed out by creepy old guys that try to hit on them unless they are famous or something so you probably wont even get the chance to.

Though your attraction usually grows with you and changes as you change. I'm not really into 30 year olds, but I imagine once I'm around that age I'll probably like them. Even if they aren't objectively the hottest age group, people usually change what they find attractive in a partner, so while finding the most attractive person you can get with might be more important to people while you are young, when you're older, you might prioritize other traits.

Like when I was 15 it was very important that people had the same taste in music as me, and I disliked people who liked pop music because I thought they were basic, but now those things are really insignificant to me and I kinda cringe at my younger self because of it.

I think that you probably should go to counseling for it though, not because your attraction is that weird, but because I don't think it's normal or healthy to be as obsessed with anything as you claim to be.  There might be some underlining reason for why beyond just ""they are pretty"" if it takes up that much of your mental real estate.

Someone I can be myself around. I like to joke around a lot, so someone that has a similar sense of humor is something I'm really attracted to.  Someone who is sure of themselves. I don't like it if they are constantly ""testing"" me one way or another. I do not want to have to go through mental gymnastics. I just want to be able to unwind and have a good laugh. I don't wanna have to feel like I'm walking on eggshells, I should be able to just say what I feel.  

Someone who is honest with me and themselves, and can own up to mistakes and put in effort in improving. Someone who is logical, calm and collected during arguments. Emotional intelligence is very important as well. They should be able to maturely discuss things and come up with a compromise during conflicts. They shouldn't be spoiled or entitled to have things always go there way and be able to take a step back and look at what's actually fair and reasonable. 

Someone who is artsy in some way.  I consider myself a creative individual so I'm just naturally attracted to those with similar interests like writers, painters, dancers, singers, etc. It's really fun when you get to share something you love with someone who is just as passionate about it as you are. 

Someone who is really expressive. This one is a little hard to describe, but some people just have very good conversational skills and they are really good at getting expressing themselves. Like some people can only offer very dry basic conversation where it's like you're forever stuck in small talk and it just never gets any deeper than that and they don't seem to have much of an opinion on anything and it's just a bit dull when talking to them one on one. Those people are fine when it's in a group, but I'm attracted to the kind of girl you could just talk to for hours  about anything and everything. 

Someone who wants similar things for the future. I want to get married and have a family one day.

Someone extremely and unapologetically affectionate who loves kisses and cuddles. Maybe even a bit clingy. I would like us to just love each others company, go on dates and explore the world together even if its small scale like just going to the park together and feeding some birds or going to the beach and collecting all the cool shells we find or something. Or staying in and watching bad movies to make fun of and just enjoying each others commentary.  We should be each-others best friends.

Physically I don't think I have an exact type but I like girls who are in a healthy weight range and are in my age group so like 18-24 (I'm 21). I do really like girls who have an alternative fashion sense though, like gothic, punk, emo or even e-girl fashion."

I think it's partly because women just have a lot more stuff, so clothes that the woman wore for a minute before decided to chance into a different outfit might be all over the place, and all the beauty products like perfumes, lotions, makeup, might be all cluttered near a mirror. Also girls usually have more pillows, blankets, stuffed animals, little nick-nacks and what-nots and decor. At least for me, when you have a lot of stuff, it's easy for things to look crazy if you don't immediately pick up after yourself so if you are every in a rush to get ready in the morning, you can come back what looks like a tornado attack in your room.

It's not hard to keep a tidy room when you have minimal belongings. Some guys only own like 5 different outfits, 2 pairs of shoes, their game console, a pillow and a blanket and that's basically it.  

I've seen my older brother's room become a complete mess during finals week where he had a bunch of food trash like empty pizza boxes and stuff like that, unwashed clothes on the floor and stuff like that, couldn't even see the floor, but it took a while for it to look as bad as it did.

I really hope things turn around for you somehow. It sounds like you did everything you possibly could do, even giving up on all standards and just wanting to experience love and affection, and yet the universe decided to tease you with the idea of hope before just shitting all over it right in front of you. 

I feel for you even more because despite all that, you didn't try to bring her down or call her names in order to feel better. I wish the world was less cruel to you."

This is iodized table salt, which in addition to sodium chloride, contains anti-caking agents and potassium iodine, which is added to prevent iodine deficiency. So not only are you being overly pretentious by insisting on using scientific terminology for everyday objects, you are factually wrong. Your arrogance is your downfall, you annoying little shit."
