They are terrible about hand washing, they lick each other FFS. Every summer we are relatively disease free, as soon as school starts up, bam! Sick all the time. It’s not because disease loves cold weather, that’s for sure. No amount of hand washing and masks will keep elementary kids/teachers/staff well. They have to remove masks to eat, right? I know a full 100% of those little kids pick their nose because I’ve been saying “Don’t pick your nose!” Forever to no avail. 

As far as their solutions, only classes of 10 kids that don’t mingle, that’s impossible with most facilities where everyone comes in through the same door, use the same playground, the same lunchroom, the same bathroom, etc. masks? Ha-ha! My 5-year-old can’t keep a mask on for 10 seconds without fiddling with it. She literally can’t stop touching it. She broke the ear loops in less than a minute the last time we tried to wear a mask. She hates it, it’s hot and uncomfortable and makes it hard to breathe.
