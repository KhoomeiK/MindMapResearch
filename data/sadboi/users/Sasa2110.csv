mentalillness,f4yyvwt,t1_f4yrmg1,1571889037.0,"Uhmm... What does ""Weigh gain might strike but other antipsychotic are worse"" mean? Is it mean if I take other type I could gain more weigh than I take Seroquel? I really want to know because weigh issue is really important to me."
mentalillness,f4uexm8,t1_f4ucz0w,1571807930.0,"I have depression. I'm used to tired already but taking Seroquel I'm have no energy and feel so weak.  I don't have insomnia, in fact, I sleep a bit too much. It's really difficult to work when I feel like this. I'm thinking about stop even I just took it once time."
depression,f4pgs1f,t1_f4pglu3,1571729765.0,"Thank you, I feel better now. 

I also have epilepsy. My psychiatrist already check my meds for epilepsy and said, there's no problem and it's okay to take my anti-depressant without my neurologist knowing it. I'm glad because I'm hiding my depression from everyone. But somehow I'm still worried."
depression,f4pg4vt,t1_f4pfivd,1571728818.0,This is my 1st time. I'm kinda scared.
selfharm,f4p7cws,t1_f4p702x,1571718345.0,"Ow, thank you so much! 

I even doubt that I have depression, I think maybe I'm overacting because I still my work, smile, laugh fine. Today, the psychiatrist told me I have a "" severe depression"". I didn't believe in my ears and I have a prescription now. 

I hope you take care of yourself and will be doing well too!"

depression,f2usdh5,t1_f2un1x8,1570427002.0,"I'm writing a script and it cannot be delay because the shooting day is coming near. Even I write 8 hours/day still maybe not enough to finish it. I don't have time for going out and enjoy thing. 

Especially when I'm in a suicidal state that my psychologist suggested me to see a psychiatrist and take a treatment but I have no time for that. I can't le anyone find out about my mental state right now. 

Funny thing is I'm writing about family but I might have problem with my family (my psychologist thinks so).

Thank you so much for your reply, I like it ❤️"

I used many on alcohol them when I started cutting, first-aid stuffs then came therapist bills. I have so little money left so I have to start looking for a job now. I'm 22, nearly 23. 

For me, fake smiles and laughs resulted in blood and self-hate. I rarely cry these days, I just physically can't. I'm thinking about end myself many times recently and my therapist is on vacation until next month."
