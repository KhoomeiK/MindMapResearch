mentalillness,f4yyvwt,t1_f4yrmg1,1571889037.0,"Uhmm... What does ""Weigh gain might strike but other antipsychotic are worse"" mean? Is it mean if I take other type I could gain more weigh than I take Seroquel? I really want to know because weigh issue is really important to me."
mentalillness,f4uexm8,t1_f4ucz0w,1571807930.0,"I have depression. I'm used to tired already but taking Seroquel I'm have no energy and feel so weak.

I also have epilepsy. My psychiatrist already check my meds for epilepsy and said, there's no problem and it's okay to take my anti-depressant without my neurologist knowing it. I'm glad because I'm hiding my depression from everyone. But somehow I'm still worried."

I even doubt that I have depression, I think maybe I'm overacting because I still my work, smile, laugh fine. Today, the psychiatrist told me I have a "" severe depression"". I didn't believe in my ears and I have a prescription now. 

I hope you take care of yourself and will be doing well too!"

Especially when I'm in a suicidal state that my psychologist suggested me to see a psychiatrist and take a treatment but I have no time for that. I can't le anyone find out about my mental state right now. 

Funny thing is I'm writing about family but I might have problem with my family (my psychologist thinks so).
