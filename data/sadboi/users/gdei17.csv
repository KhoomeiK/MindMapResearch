selfimprovement,fkrrkj4,t3_fik522,1584474618.0,Thank you so much for this! just sent you a pm! :)
selfimprovement,fkrgwm2,t3_fjar5i,1584468640.0,I'm feeling this so much right now :/ It's somewhat comforting to know that I'm not the only one feeling this right now... I'm trying my best to see this period as a time to reflect deeper and start to slowly come up with things and some creative ways that I can do to be more productive again...
selfimprovement,fkrcp74,t3_fjqx05,1584466241.0,"I've been through the exact same thing too! Honestly, the fact that you posted this concern here means that you have done a self-reflection = you are growing and will continue to do so! And for that, you should give yourself some credits! :)

What's been helping me is by picking up a new and productive habit and try to stick to it as much as you can. For me, I started doing meditation every day for 10-15 minutes... And then I started adding a bit of workout a few times a week. It's not about how fast you can achieve your goals, but it's about consistency and taking it one small step at a time. Those few things have helped me ground myself and grow as an individual. It has given me more confidence in myself; not just physically, but mentally because it proves to me that I am capable to grow. 

Another thing that's been helpful for my communication and social skills is by writing down comments or reviews (and you can do it anonymously as well). I also download a friendship app and so it's kinda like a gentle nudge to get myself out there and practice my communication and social skills.

I hope it helps even just a bit! :)"
