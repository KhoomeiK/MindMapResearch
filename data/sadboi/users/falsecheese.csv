AskReddit,fcjwnc4,t3_ehg5ac,1577708284.0,"When I was in primary school I had a long trek to the school bus stop. I could ride my bike half way, along our super long driveway, but then our property ended and I had to leave it behind the old barn at the end of our road. 
Eventually I got lazy and started riding it all the way to the bus stop. The stop was in a remote area on a fairly isolated country road. Across the road from my stop was a vacant lot and I started stashing my bike there. 
One day I got off the bus after school, went up into the bushes and couldn't find my bike. Oh shit. Ima be in trouble. 
When I exited the lot there was a man standing at my stop. He said he'd seen me putting my bike there and he didn't want it to get stolen so he'd put it in his shed fir me. I should come down and get it. 
I was a fairly naive kid, but I just knew something about him wasn't right. I knew he was lying. I thanked him and made my excuses that I couldn't go to strangers houses and said I'd get my dad to pick it up... he let me go after a bit more of an attempt to convince me. I watched my back all the way down the road, wanting to RUN but strolling and singing instead. Then I had to own up when I got home. For once I wasn't in that much trouble. My foster dad went to retrieve my bike, gave the guy an earful, and I felt like prey every time I went to the bus stop for the next few years. He lived right by it, and we heard that he was divorced after he put a shotgun down his wife's throat. I think it was played off that he was lonely and single. He never tried anything again though."
