It’s hard to say what’s better honestly, I think 72 hours is not long enough for someone to turn around from their anger about being detained and realize they need help in most cases, but I do think that especially with the inconsistencies in quality of care the right to detain someone for longer periods of time could be bad.

Hospitals have forgiveness programs and payment plans, which can help some people. I’m young so my mom still helps with my medical bills, she makes enough that she probably wouldn’t qualify for debt forgiveness, and I know if I need treatment it will cost her a lot of money, which makes it harder to justify going.

AskReddit,fhjl6b3,t3_f3lp8l,1581648937.0,"I moved back to New York City recently, and it’s been exhausting and overwhelming in new ways because I’m dealing with chronic illness and disability. Relevant info is that one of the things I deal with is fatigue, and it is aggravated from being upright, stairs, being active walking or standing, mental tasks, etc. This makes things like using the subway to get from my apartment to my destination exhausting in and of itself. 

It would be so helpful to be able to take breaks and relax in the middle of the day when I’m out and about. For example, if I can leave super early and rest somewhere before doing the things I have planned and then rest in between things if I happen to have multiple, that would be endlessly helpful (at least I think/hope so- it’s worth a try).

I’ve researched nap opportunities in New York and there seems to be one place still running that offers naps (I’m talking they give you PJs, a nap pod, and 45 minutes to rest- it’s called the Dreamery and is basically a way to advertise the brand’s mattresses), but they charge $25 a pop, and as I found out today you can’t really book one day of- it’s gotta be planned in advance and they’re not super available. Other than that, I thought of booking a massage or facial, but those are generally *very* expensive, and I wouldn’t be able to do that on any kind of regular basis. 

Things I’ve already tried: 
* I have an AMC movie theater membership, so if I’m near a theater I have popped in for a film to rest. They have really comfy reclining chairs (in one theater they were even heated!!), but it’s super loud and not particularly restorative. This is $25 a month for 3 films a week
* While traveling in Seattle I was able to find a bathhouse that had a relaxation area. That was $20 for a day pass and I was able to get clean and take a nap. I don’t know of an equivalent in NYC. 
* Right now the main thing I do is sit in coffee shops between things or before things to rest, but it’s still upright and not really relaxing. 
* Obviously in nice weather, parks and benches are an option. But it’s still winter and my fatigue doesn’t stop for rain. 

I just got a job so I’m willing to pay a bit for the opportunity to rest (which would make my job easier on me) if I’m super tired, but probably not more than like $20 per day and that would only be in the case of dire need. Ideally something that’s around or under $10 would be more regularly doable for me, or free. 

The most important points I’m looking for:
* the ability to recline or lay flat
* low stimulation- i.e. quiet, calm, not too bright
* affordable or free
* socially acceptable/won’t bring me weird attention (because that would defeat the purpose, I’d be too anxious to rest)
* works in any weather- regardless of cold or rain 


So- think outside the box. What’s a restful activity you can access in a city?"

I’ve been told this neurological condition and it’s symptoms are all psychiatric in origin by some doctors who didn’t know about the condition. 

Flash forward to 2 weeks ago, I’d been off my meds since June, waiting for the other shoe to drop, and it finally does. I go full blown: the shadows are moving, spirits want to attack me, there’s an underground society of normal looking people that can read my mind, etcetera, and I’m straight up terrified.

“I [born into a wealthy family, afforded many tutors and extracurriculars, college fully paid for by parents] didn’t have any trouble getting into and affording a top school, therefore anyone can do it, and if they didn’t, that is only based off their own incompetence [despite different opportunities growing up, and completely different levels of financial barriers]”

Your post and replies exhibit a lack of empathy, and lack of understanding.

TrueOffMyChest,f5agfhs,t1_f5act3r,1572106896.0,"I get what you mean, and I want to be clear that I’m not attacking you, I’m just trying to further this conversation. Even the comments you used in your example, though, are not said in a bubble- if I were to say “black people are the worst,” for example, I am acknowledging and validating a system of bias that has existed, does exist, and makes things harder for people of color. If I say “white people are the worst,” I am making a shitty generalization, sure, it might be unwarranted or at the very least inaccurate (not all white people or whatever), but there’s no established racist undertone that my comment is feeding.

I completely agree that fighting hate with hate isn’t effective, and it’s pretty hypocritical (for example, why women catcalling men to try to make them feel uncomfortable is not an effective way to stop the catcalling issue. Maybe in an educational film, to illustrate a point, but in practice everyday? That’s just making more people uncomfortable. And the men that are running topless that you’re yelling at probably aren’t the men that are catcalling you or following you when you’re walking home at night. Making more people uncomfortable is not the goal!). It’s sometimes one of the first ways people illustrate an inequality, but I don’t think it’s an effective tool to use long term. The fight for equality is one that can only be effective when it’s filled with compassion, patience, open mindedness, and understanding, from both sides, which can admittedly be fucking difficult if the side you are trying to educate doesn’t consider your existence or rights valid. 

Anyway, that’s a tangent. What I mean to say is, these things are still not comparable, though I get how it’s frustrating and isolating rather than making you feel more sympathetic towards a cause.... but then there’s the true fact that your betterment shouldn’t be only on the shoulders of people fighting for understanding! That shit is exhausting. People can’t only be thinking of your feelings when fighting for their rights. It gets frustrating. Hence comments involving “white male tears”"
TrueOffMyChest,f5aec9k,t3_dn9k0c,1572105830.0,"This whole post is awfully misinformed. Obesity does not occur in a vacuum.

TrueOffMyChest,f5abv6e,t3_dnbkbr,1572104434.0,"I think the way this situation came about can be explained like this: when two parties are not on equal standing, it is not enough to just start treating them exactly the same- their levels are not yet even, the disparity wouldn’t change. So, inevitably, to even things out, the poorly treated party must be treated better, and the party previously entertaining, for example, positive bias, privilege, etc, must relinquish some of it. 

This is where men are getting a taste of the ridicule that women historically have had. Where white people are understanding that race does impact how people are treated, and needing to acknowledge and accommodate that. Sure, maybe it gets a bit overboard in some circles, with “man-hating” jokes and “white male tears” comments (though, overboard is certainly subjective here). But this is not a widespread or systemic hatred, this is the lashing out of a subgroup of people, usually more radical in ideology. In essence- this is absolutely not racism. 

Implicit bias, systemic stereotypes, they are still on the cisgender, heterosexual, white males’ side. This can be objectively observed. Maybe you have a bad experience when entering a safe space for queer trans people of color, or a radical feminist woman’s space, idk, but that experience or even handful of experiences absolutely do not compare to the kind of prejudice and discrimination that these groups have historically experienced, and in the majority of places, still do experience."

ContraPoints,f44qw91,t1_f42x06u,1571357223.0,"In your example though, the person is still experiencing dysphoria, it’s just a specific kind.. I don’t know that I agree that some trans people don’t have dysphoria, I just think maybe the common definition of dysphoria isn’t accurate? I’ve spoken about this with a trans friend of mine when I was first crackin the egg, and I was just so confused because I really didn’t feel like a woman, and that identity was growing more and more distressing as I was opening up about it, but I didn’t have the traditional narrative of like, “at 3 years old my mom tried to put me in a dress and I cried for hours.” I definitely understood the feeling of gender euphoria for myself at the time though, and he made a point that made a lot of sense to me. He basically said, how do you know you have gender euphoria if you don’t have some form of lesser comfort in the other gender(s)? What I mean is, the highs don’t make sense without the lows. If someone feels euphoric as an MTF trans woman, that means that for her, identifying as a cis man probably didn’t feel great. Otherwise, wouldn’t they feel the same? And isn’t dysphoria just being uncomfortable with certain gendered experiences?

I have a lot of top and voice dysphoria mainly, and the rest kind of gets better and worse. The best way I could describe the experience of having to present as female would be that it’s just very very uncomfortable- it’s like climbing into an ick suit, it’s not me, it feels wrong. I would call that dysphoria, but from your definition maybe it isn’t? I’ve said before that if I were born at a time when questioning your gender wasn’t as accepted as it is now, I’d probably stay closeted until I was 40 and it became unbearable."

findareddit,f41l9bn,t3_dj1hxv,1571320777.0,"Thanks y’all. My phrasing of “hating on women” may have been a bit strong, I wrote this late at night when I got sick of all the shitty humor relying on simple outdated stereotypes and it came out that way. I myself am a guy, but like, idk call me crazy I don’t think dunking on women is inherently funny... it’s just lazy shitty humor. There are a lot of replies so I’ll look through them today. The memes don’t have to be about any one topic, just something other than juvenile girls-go-to-Jupiter stuff. 

Also- r*tard is a slur that was thrown at people with developmental disabilities for a looong time, it was used to discredit their value to society. It’s a super offensive term, and super easy not to use! Literally there are so many other words. No reason to use that one.

Edit: I’d definitely rather eat Randy"
MensLib,f405mne,t3_diw800,1571285859.0,"As someone with anxiety I definitely used to breathe out the word sorry all day everyday. It took a lot of effort to stop that habit, and was definitely a symptom of low self worth. That is certainly not something to aspire to. However, the staunch refusal to acknowledge wrongdoing that stops some people from apologizing leads to a wall being built in relationships. I think we can all benefit from more humility and empathy. 

The answer: when it’s warranted, apologize. Not more, not less. The key is not how much you apologize, but how well you can tell when it’s warranted and act accordingly."

AskReddit,f3txrbz,t1_f3thk78,1571148604.0,"It depends on the person and the situation, but usually suicidal ideation is rooted in irrational thinking and suffering. If that person can receive the right care and start feeling a bit better, they will gain some resilience to fight the suicidal thinking. Meds help a lot at this stage too. The important things are taking them seriously, getting them help, and maintaining a support network."
AskReddit,f3twqjy,t1_f3tpsc2,1571147931.0,"I’m sorry for your loss. It’s not your fault though, sometimes it’s impossible to know."
AskReddit,f3tw1oq,t1_f3tp5t7,1571147483.0,"I’ve thought about this too. For the vast majority of people who are suicidal, though, what they want is an end to the pain, which is not the same as a life. A depressed person tends to have blinders on, and it’s easy to believe that the miserable state you’re in now will never end and that your two options are: live this misery (which seems more and more unbearable as time goes on), or leave it. They may start to feel that they are doing everybody a favor by committing suicide because they feel like a burden. The suicidality is rooted in irrational thoughts. 

The grey area is for a much smaller subset of mental illness, where the person has been receiving proper care for years and years, maybe decades, have tried every med and treatment out there, have been in therapy, but still suffer every day. It’s tough to make someone go on when nothing is helping. However, new meds and treatments come out over time, and mental states change over time. It could be that a new study reveals a cause for their symptoms that produces a targeted treatment that cures them, who knows. Mental illness is not usually terminal per se, like other illnesses that allow for assisted suicide. 

Source: hospitalized twice, suicidal for years, finally got the care I needed, the right meds, and slowly climbed out of that hole.  When I was suicidal, I didn’t want to live *like that,* and I didn’t imagine it was possible to get out of that mess and live any other way, hence thinking suicide was the best option. I’m bipolar, and do find myself back in dark places again sometimes, and know that I will indefinitely, but now I know it’s temporary, it’s ok, and I have so much to look forward to (it’s not that I know it, I feel it, I live it, I believe it. Don’t tell this to a suicidal person to help them, they need to *know* it themselves)

Edit: typos"
TrollCoping,f3tt2tc,t1_f3tjmqe,1571145385.0,"Yeah it can be tied to OCD, but it can also be an anxious tic. Depends on the person. Glad you can speak about it to your therapist :)"
TrollCoping,f3swhb9,t3_dhv39r,1571110950.0,"Yo. For real. I’ve been trying different physical solutions for my finger picking specifically, and I made a [few prototypes](https://imgur.com/gallery/qsUVwf6)  of fabric finger cots and it seems promising. There are boring ones on amazon, and some colorful ones I found on Aliexpress, but I experimented with adding beading where the nail is to make it seem like a fashion choice and I kinda dig where it’s going!

I’ve tried so many things over the years- lace gloves, bandaids of course, liquid latex, gentle tape, latex finger cots, among others, and what I love about this option is that it doesn’t leave residue on your skin or nail, they don’t fall off that easily, they work on touchscreens, they are breathable so your skin doesn’t shrivel up underneath them, they are comfy, and most of all they are smooth- no catching on fabric surfaces. Still need to test it out for a while but it seems promising."

bipolar,f30f5jr,t3_detnlt,1570553042.0,"Latuda helped me sooo much. The annoying parts are drowsiness and needing to take it with a snack, but honestly it’s so worth it for the help it brought me. Also, to ease your anxiety, if you do develop a side effect, you can get medical help, tell them the meds you’re on, and they will help you get off it. In a pro-con situation, the risks far outweigh the benefits if you’re struggling and these can help you, at least they did for me"
bipolar,f30erh4,t3_devza8,1570552801.0,When I get hypo I will laugh to myself a lot and sometimes get so emotional that I start crying... like the most random things are funny and then soooo sad or terrifying. Then it stops as quickly as it started.
bipolar,f30ejtm,t1_f30eaud,1570552666.0,"In fact, the second time I had gone to my disability resource advisor and asked hypothetically what would happen if I had to take a few days off (to get help). I guess she sniffed that things weren’t ok and walked me over to counseling, which sent me to the hospital. It was ok. Your health and your life are more important than sticking to a perfect work schedule."
bipolar,f30eaud,t3_dexcwm,1570552508.0,"I think the fact that you’re planning for not dying means you really want things to change, but part of you doesn’t sincerely want to die. You don’t have to attempt suicide to get serious help. I’ve been hospitalized twice because I was about to carry out a plan but didn’t attempt. I’m a student but both times my professors and my bosses and coworkers at the places I worked were very understanding regardless of how many details they knew. I just told people I was sick and had to spend time in the hospital- which is true- and it was fine."

ainbow,f2zbz74,t3_demwvq,1570514035.0,"I think this is huge for people who argue that gender dysphoria is just body dysmorphia- an illness. Body dysmorphia persists- if your dysmorphia convinces you you’re one thing then you will feel like you are that regardless of how close to death the opposite of it you get. Gender dysphoria gets better with transition and gender validation though, which is close to the opposite of how an irrational self image issue works."

I’ve gotten financial help from family to eat healthier, but it only worked because my barrier was money, not whether or not I had the desire to eat healthier."
AmItheAsshole,f2z7sqy,t3_delta8,1570509337.0,"I think you’re NTA but I also see her point of view. Nowadays, especially in certain schools/areas, college is made out to be the only option once you’re out of high school. It’s all about prepping for college, getting into a good one, and going there. Alternate routes are not presented, or if they are they’re tossed aside. This is wrong I think, but besides the case, when all your teachers are talking about college and all your peers are going to college, and on top of that your parents are insisting you go to college, it feels assumed that you will too, and that your parents will help. In the US, it costs enormous amounts of money, so it’s not something a high school graduate can usually just pay for. A lot of kids sort of assume that college is a given. The thing is, parents don’t *owe* their kids college, which is why you’re not TA, but to find out that this huge opportunity they’ve been preparing for their whole life is suddenly not guaranteed is jarring, upsetting, and terrifying. 

I think the things you are requesting are reasonable, but to a brand new college freshman who views it as a life experience that they should enjoy, they may not be thinking about it pragmatically. She is probably upset by this dose of reality, and it would help for you to understand her point of view and communicate more with her."
AmItheAsshole,f2wjrty,t3_degzhj,1570466625.0,"I’m gonna go ahead and say ESH. I think it makes sense for your roommates to want some communication about a new person spending a significant amount of time in their home. I also think their reaction of kicking your partner out and being ok with everyone else’s is unreasonable (especially if your health keeps you home). There may be some animosity about the lack of communication when this started. I don’t think being petty will solve this, I think a better tactic would be to apologize you didn’t clear it first, and then explain your needs and why their reaction was hurtful. It’s a different story if homophobia is involved, but either way, y’all have to talk about it."

I get paranoid about my thoughts because I’m scared people can read them, for example, but I also know factually that that’s ridiculous and not true... doesn’t stop that thought from plaguing me. My therapist told me the worst thing to do would be to start acknowledging and acting upon these beliefs, and to hold on to the part of me that knows they aren’t real, though honestly in my experience that only gets harder. Ultimately, I had to get on a higher dose of antipsychotics for a couple months. That helped a lot. Please consider taking your meds before things get out of hand. You have a grip now. You might not later."
