Like bruh I love PewDiePie but this is just gross. I feel genuinely bad for the other students that aren't even PDP fans. Like imagine BUYING your yearbook after you graduate for keepsake... And it's just a fucking glaring PDP reference for a youtuber you may or may not even be a fan of.

This is not going to age well."

I personally would pay premium just to live in an apartment or condo building that doesn't allow children to reside in the building.

Or am I just looking for a frat house? Haha

Edit: although it sounds amazing, issa joke"

The way he fucking lined up for a punch too because he was mad he didn't get to blow the candles out. What a short time to go from 0-100 and wanting to throw punches. Jesus.

And a choir of comments going ""ah yes that's totally BPD! I do that!"" Without mention of the idea that this isn't exclusive to us. 

Guys, we all have BPD in this sub. It's hard. But not every nuisance that happens to us is because of BPD. It feels like some people here are clinging so hard to this personality disorder being their *only* personality."

I also have PCOS, have been chubby my whole life, and my mom has always harassed me about my weight (albeit not as bad as your mom does), so I definitely understand what you're feeling. My mom fueled my binge eating every single time she told me I'm fat lmao

The only thing that helped me was actually moving out, so I hope you get outta there again as soon as this COVID shit is over."

AmItheAsshole,fpurmp8,t1_fpunmlj,1588921389.0,"not trying to argue, but I'm of the understanding that breaks are temporary. I feel that it usually happens with the intention that the couple agreeing to have a ""break"" will get back together after a certain timeframe or whatever. Like the timeframe is explicitly talked about before going on a break, and what the rules of the break are - like some couples go on break with the understanding that neither of them will hook up with anyone, and that they're still into each other, they just need space for a moment, as an example.

Though I'm not really sure how common this understanding is, but just wanted to give you a different take on ""breaks"""

Like take a moment to think about how you are considering dropping friends over this, when you didn't even bring it up with them FIRST when this is YOUR achievement??? What is this self centered life you're living when you expect other people to notice whatever you're doing and be up to date with YOUR life???

Especially during this plague, like bruh wtf, people got their own lives to live and you just out here like ""HMP I didn't get the attention I wanted >:("" LMFAO"

PewdiepieSubmissions,fo5svjj,t3_g5n6me,1587534625.0,This was a baaaad video between the topic and Felix's reactions to some of the questions and avoidance to other questions. His avoidance was pointless - he was still gonna get some backlash whether he said something or not lmao

This entire video just made me wanna scream ""eat the rich"" lmfao"
relationships,fnfr02h,t1_fnfm1tr,1586913651.0,"I really hope that OP sees this. Everyone is talking about him abandoning the unwanted child as if he was a full grown adult at the time it happened. This was a decision he had to make as a 16 year old and with a girl that wasn't even his girlfriend!!! What he said about her ""not closing her legs"" was callous, but I'd forgive it as it's probably a lot of anger and resentment and guilt that was finally coming our after 20 years being hidden and tucked away. People change too, you guys!!! 

People refuse to understand men that aren't ready for kids. People get all shocked when they find out that the men that don't want kids, won't want to do anything with the kids, and would sign their rights away, which is likely what OP's husband did... All the while abortion is celebrated in women. It's such a double standard. I don't understand why it's hard to understand that ""trapping"" a guy is a very real thing SOME women do with pregnancy. No sympathy towards the men that don't want kids and accidentally gets someone pregnant, but all the sympathy towards women that don't want kids that accidentally gets pregnant and can opt for abortion. 

People on Reddit love to do the ""this is a deal breaker!!! Break up!!!"" speech, but don't realize that that isn't always the easiest to do, nor is it always the best thing to do. Marriages are worthless when it all just comes down to ""just divorce them!"" when the going gets tough.

Either way OP, I think you need to talk to your husband and just work this out. Give him a shot to just talk sober and get therapy. I think what happened to him was super traumatic and left a bitter taste in his mouth towards the woman he accidentally got pregnant, which is probably why he talked so badly of her. Who knows, now that he's hopefully more mature and now has kids of his own, he'll want to reconnect with his son."

AmItheAsshole,fmaf1w6,t3_ftum7d,1585892039.0,"ESH. Obviously he's an asshole because of the harrassment. You got a great deal on that guitar and I don't even blame you for going for it.

BUT, this is AITA, and what you did was not the nicest thing you could have done. At the end of the day, regardless of how much of an idiot the seller was (and he was a HUGE idiot), it was still morally wrong of you to walk into that exchange knowing the guitar is worth 10x more than what the guy was selling it for.

Also, your wife is an idiot for telling the guy that you knew it's true worth. I feel that this wouldn't have escalated so much if you were given the chance to play it off as if you didn't know. If we're gonna be an asshole, might as well be an asshole all the way right?"
