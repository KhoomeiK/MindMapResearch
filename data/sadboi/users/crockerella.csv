selfhelp,foupord,t1_foup6p8,1588088327.0,"you’re so welcome! and sorry if I wrote too much, I’m wordy sometimes :) but yeah look up “mindfulness,” that concept could be of help"
selfhelp,foun8xj,t1_foufyhi,1588087124.0,"I completely understand feeling like human garbage, like a waste of time and space. The only thing is, I realized that all of these horrible things I was thinking about myself simply weren’t true. I still think of myself this way sometimes if I’m having a bad day and not being mindful of my thoughts but the difference between now and my past is that I understand my thoughts and anxiety pretty well. It sounds like you have anxiety too. Basically all you have to understand to start is this: you are not your thoughts! You are the awareness that exists beyond all of your thoughts and feelings. Usually our minds spin out thoughts all day long to keep us busy, or in the case of someone with anxiety, to keep us safe. Back in ancient times humans had to be alert for predators and other external threats. In the modern age our threats are more intangible, for example the threat of social rejection. It might seem strange, but sometimes when your brain is telling you to isolate and to play it safe and small and not be your fully realized self it is literally just trying to protect you from rejection or embarrassment, albeit in a really shitty way. It’s not you or your brain’s fault it has been conditioned in this way. The good news is that you can learn to be an observer of your thoughts instead of just reacting to them. If you think, “man I’m the worst,” just take a step back for a moment and examine that statement. Don’t judge it, don’t do anything except let it pass you by. Many other thoughts like this may come and go. Don’t try to angrily reject them, don’t give in and agree, just watch. When you do this without reacting the thoughts will eventually fade away like a cloud in the sky, passing into nothingness, and you realize that they can only hurt you if you let them. Then you can gradually start to actively choose to think more kindly towards yourself. That is what acceptance is. Seeing your thoughts for what they are, just thoughts. Understanding you are no better or worse than anyone you meet. I would say try to be like a friend to your own soul. I think you can go to therapy for any reason at all, even if you think your issues aren’t that bad. If something’s bothering you and affecting you to this degree that it impacts your quality of life, that is reason enough to see someone! It is a therapist’s job to be helpful, not to judge clients based on their perceived worthiness. You are a precious person in this world whether you see it in yourself or not. And you don’t just deserve basic needs, you truly deserve happiness and fulfillment in life. I believe this from the bottom of my heart and I trust any good therapist would tell you the same."
selfhelp,fouc57i,t3_g9mimv,1588081152.0,"It sounds like you are dealing with deep feelings of shame just for existing. Wanting to hide yourself away, feeling worthless and undeserving of even being alive. I understand these feelings; I‘ve felt them too. But let me ask you this: do you feel as though others are unworthy, underserving of food and water and shelter and love and connection? You, just like every other person on earth, deserve to have your needs met and to feel good. It doesn’t matter what you’ve done or haven’t done. Everyone has made mistakes. Everyone has burdened their family at times. God knows I have! But letting these feelings drag me into the depths of despair is a terrible waste of my one precious life. Your life is precious, too. Maybe try to look at yourself with clear eyes and see that you deserve to be treated kindly by yourself. I have a hard time with this as well. I meditate, and even when I feel bad I tell myself I‘m good and worthy of all the goodness life has to offer. You may not believe these words, I know they’re just words, but listen to your heart! Doesn’t it ache when you think badly of yourself? Doesn’t it make you feel worse and worse as though a bully was telling you all of these things? Don’t be a bully to yourself. Wouldn’t your life be different if you could see yourself more compassionately? If you can’t love yourself right away because it seems like too big of a leap, work on acceptance. Just for today, try accepting yourself just as you are. Just for today, appreciate that you have been given this life and know that you can truly be happy if you learn to be kind to yourself. It might take time, but trust yourself that you are capable of figuring it out. If you need to go to therapy, that’s a wonderful way to help reframe your thoughts. You can get an objective opinion of yourself instead of the warped image that you currently hold. I’m glad you posted here and I hope this is at least somewhat helpful even if it just boils down to “learn to love and accept yourself”. I know it’s not easy, but I’m on the same path and I’m rooting for you!"
Meditation,fou74o2,t3_g9m84t,1588077911.0,"I understand the feeling. I used to binge skins back in college and think man why didn’t I just say fuck school and make friends and party? and then I remember how fucking lame people were in high school and I’m glad I waited until college to start having fun. Skins will always hold a special place in my heart and I love it and parts of it are kinda realistic but to be honest most of it isn’t realistic at all and it glorifies the shit out of drugs and partying like they’re the greatest things ever. but if you actually pay attention like yeah the characters have fun but they also fuck things up for themselves and engage in petty drama constantly! I’ll take the quiet nerdy life I had in hs any day over all that hysterical bs! but big shoutout to Cassie for helping me realize I had an eating disorder, that shit might’ve saved my life. anyways sorry for the rambling but bottom line is just enjoy the show and try not to overthink things! the past is dead, focus on the here and now and get excited for the future!"

spirituality,fngc2c7,t3_g1l878,1586927756.0,"it’s okay! you’re not alone, meditation can be really hard at first. I’m in no way an expert but I would love to share the few things I’ve learned about meditating over the years. the number one thing that I believe helped me was realizing the only way you can miss the point of meditating is to beat yourself up for doing it “wrong”. there is no wrong way! just do it in the way that works for you. if you’re finding yourself too antsy when you try meditating then maybe experiment with exercising beforehand to tire you out and pre-calm your mind a bit. some people meditate right when they wake up or just before they go to sleep. hell, I often meditate lying in my bed! sometimes I meditate in the bath! there are no real rules unless you’re doing a specific type of meditation but generally there’s no wrong way to meditate. you just are aware that you’re aware. that’s it! thoughts will come and go, if you find yourself following a train of thought just gently return to your awareness. definitely don’t get mad at yourself for being distracted at first, it takes time to get used to the feeling of not “doing” anything and your brain’s gonna be flipping out for your attention. treat it gently and just keep redirecting your attention back to that feeling of just being. also there are a ton of dope ass guided meditations on YouTube, maybe give some of those a try! hope this helps!! ✌🏼💖"

The tone was so off, and don’t even get me started on the characters, dude. I wish Dwayne McDuffie was still alive!

DecidingToBeBetter,fml0nzn,t3_fvx79r,1586175336.0,"You can’t control how other people act. You seem to have a strong sense of what kind of person you would like to be. Does this include being a person who is easily bothered by others? Who lets people get under their skin constantly? Try and realize that other people do not hold your same exact standards and that the act of judging people for something they have no idea about is kind of an unfair behavior. I get annoyed by people too but everyone is the way they are for reasons you have no idea about. You don’t have to like how people are but you do have to respect them as people, you know? If you go around holding everyone to your standards in your head they’ll just be going about their day as usual and you will be miserable. If your happiness and comfort depends on the actions and behaviors of others you will be sorely disappointed. It’s hard for me too, I get annoyed constantly. But it’s usually because I’m caught up in my head thinking too much and I need to try seeing things from another perspective. Just do the best you can to relax and let shit go."

When my mom got too drunk the next night I got pissed and snapped at her to eat something. I made her some food right after but it made me so angry. Maybe it’s because I live with my mom and see her drunk all the time, and she never passes out. Like I believe she can handle herself. And it seems like my dad can’t. Idk.

depressionregimens,f65586s,t3_dqehot,1572699146.0,"I started it for bipolar and PMDD about three weeks ago and my impressions are that it stars working REALLY quickly, like within the first week. It made me verrry tired, so try to take it at night. Always take it after eating at least 350 calories or you’ll probably get nauseous. Another side effect is appetite increase, which rocks for me because I have an eating disorder and this drug ensures that I eat 3 meals a day. A weird side effect, and the one I like the least, is akathasia, or a feeling of extreme restlessness. Hopefully this will go away but it is nice to have energy after being face-down-in-the-bed depressed for the last 10 years. My anxiety is really...different? I still have some anxiety but it’s dulled. It doesn’t completely take over. I haven’t had a panic attack since I started Latuda. This drug has been very helpful for me, unlike any of the multiple SSRI’s that I took over the years. There’s pros and cons but if it works it works. Good luck!"

Have you ever thought about talking to a therapist or a school counselor? Also, a bad grade seems like confirmation that you’re shit, but if you put it in perspective, your grades might be suffering because you are struggling right now. A bad grade is not a reflection of who you are, but an indicator of your situation at the moment. Don’t take it as a sign that everything is shit, take it as a sign that you’re having a hard time and may need help! We all need help at times, even though it may not seem that way. You are worthy.

I try to do things that lessen my anxiety, like working out, meditating, getting enough to eat and enough sleep. Reduce stress as much as possible!

All they did was administer me the bare minimum dose of Ativan and give me a powdered potassium supplement drink. The original bill was around $5,000, went down to $2,800 after the no-insurance “discount.” Doesn’t seem like a lot but it is when you have no job and no money at all. I cried when I opened it."

I used to be so impatient waiting for my nails to dry and I’d always mess them up because I’d have to pee or something but a while back I found a topcoat called seche vite and you paint it on wet polish and it dries your nails quickly and makes them look BEAUTIFUL! I use it every time I paint my nails and it’s a godsend! and tbh you can still mess your nails up if you’re not careful but it dries wayyyy faster than regular polish alone or other quick dry topcoats I’ve used in the past."

AustralianShepherd,f38gama,t3_dg28nj,1570736310.0,"I know that they make dog food bowls designed to slow down your dog’s eating, maybe this would help? My Aussie used to act like this as a puppy but if he’s getting enough food there’s no way he’s still hungry. Don’t be fooled by those puppy dog eyes! If you just want to slow down his eating maybe try one of those special bowls. Idk, just a thought!"

Petioles,f3111o6,t3_df4fox,1570566083.0,it’s not pathetic! I think you’re brave for trying to face reality head-on. Most people in this world use substances to get through their lives. Suddenly not having something that makes life more bearable is really difficult. It’s not uncommon to want some relief from the shitshow that is life. I don’t really have any advice besides try to distract yourself. I’m going through a shitty situation too and I definitely don’t have the answers but I want to say good luck and I’m rooting for you!
