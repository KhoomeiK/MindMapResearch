suspiciouslyspecific,fb19ljy,t1_fb0zr4z,1576433800.0,"Just saying, in my experience Bipolar is not nearly that fast. Rapid cycling bipolar is 4+ mood swings within a year, and even that isn't nowhere near that fast. Bipolar disorder isn't necessarily changing moods a hundred times within an hour.

Not trying to dismiss OP's struggles, but that really doesn't sound like BP. It isn't mild mood swings. It's often relative normalcy for some time, then depression lasting weeks or even a few months, to mania that can last a week or longer. Hell, if I remember correctly the DSM requires at least one week of mania/hypomania to diagnose Bipolar and Bipolar type 2 respectively.

Gonna be honest, leaving like 3 snarky responses on different comments trying to discredit what people are saying is super annoying. You don't have to be a doctor to know what bipolar is. Diagnose, yes, recognize, no. And as somebody with the disorder OP's situation doesn't sound similar."

It's definitely not an illness you can outright notice, like you said. I've known other bipolar people and didn't know until they said in advance. The only time anybody has ever found out I was bipolar on their own was when I had a really bad episode, lost most contact with reality and thought I was in the past, and tried cutting my best friend off permanently. It's fun lmao."
