In Germany, the ""media bias"" (In German the specific term is ""Lügenpresse"") argument is primarily one that i thrown around by the far right AfD. I'm not suggesting you are far right or anything, but try to reflcet sometimes about that. Yes the monopolies need to be broken up and yes 80% of British Media is objectively bloody bonkers. But not at the cost of freedom of press.   


In some ways, Corbyns and his followers inability to reflect led to the 2019 disaster - the media has little to do with Corbyns mistakes, it only gave them more fuel."
