‚ÄúThere is a big difference in usage of these word groups. However sometimes they appear very similar.

First let me explain the question words DORE and DOCCHI.
DOCCHI and DORE both mean ""Which one?"" but DORE is used when you are talking about 3 or more items. DOCCHI is used when talking about only 2 items. It would be very strange to ask DOCCHI DESU KA when there are 3 choices, instead DORE DESU KA must be used.

As for the other words in these KO-SO-A-DO groups (Lesson 2 Course 1) the following applies:

1. If you are asked DORE DESU KA ""Which one is it?"" then you will always answer using the KORE, SORE, ARE words. And vice-versa if you are asked DOCCHI DESU KA ""Which one is it?"" then you would respond with KOCCHI, SOCCHI, ACCHI.

2. KORE, SORE and ARE can also be used when referring to just 1 object. You might not even know how many items there are. A good example of this is KORE WA NAN DESU KA. ""What is this?"" But you would not use KOCCHI, SOCCHI and ACCHI this way.

Other Uses of KOCCHI, SOCCHI, ACCHI, DOCCHI
The DOCCHI word group is also commonly used in replacement of DOKO, KOKO, SOKO, ASOKO (Where, here, there, over there). More than replacement they are a sort of informal version of the DOCHIRA word group. But let's not go that far in this answer as that will come up in other lessons.

Politeness
There is no politeness difference between the DOCCHI and DORE word groups. They are just used in different situations. However in different context keep in mind that the DOCCHI word group IS considered a more informal version of the DOCHIRA group.

You can look at the how these word groups are used in Lesson 2 Course 1 and beyond and listen to the sentences in the Q&A to help you further.‚Äù"
