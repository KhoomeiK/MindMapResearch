My wife and I were together for 10 years before we got married. 6 years in I came to find out she had an “emotional” relationship with a coworker of hers. It deeply effected me and we separated for approximately 6-8 months. We ended up reconciling and getting married. Two years into our marriage that previous episode bubbled into a fight (we don’t ever fight...very similar to you, we’re ‘like best friends). 

We ended up going through couples therapy and it was obvious I was still not over things. Grief usually sits on after shock and apparently I was in shock for a long long time. Grief crept in probably year 8 or 9 and I tried to bury it to move on. Therapy helped and I think it helped her understand the deep feelings I had. 

My situation maybe unique or maybe it’s one of many. Who knows. But if you care enough to try therapy again, at least you’ll know you tried all options. GL to you."
