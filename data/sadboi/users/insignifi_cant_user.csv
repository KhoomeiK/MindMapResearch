exmormon,fq72dpe,t3_gh20g4,1589140896.0,as someone with ptsd from abuse I would have probably had a panic attack. has anyone had any experience with issues like that? I can't imagine no one completely freaked out.
exmormon,fnqq0y5,t1_fnnrumk,1587169715.0,its a keychain/lanyard
BoJackHorseman,fmm1diy,t3_fvvj8j,1586196983.0,it ended in the most bojack way possible. bojack survived and had to live with the consequences of his actions. sometimes life is a bitch and then you keep on living.
exmormon,fmk0941,t1_fmjqk5y,1586141474.0,you deserved better. I'm glad things went okay! all that over being an artist is crazy.
exmormon,fmjlhdb,t1_fmjl0ht,1586132714.0,I hope things are better now
exmormon,fmjl0vi,t1_fmj9d7x,1586132447.0,I'm glad this place is here! I don't think he realises either. he doesn't seem to get why I'm being distant today.
exmormon,fmjkvt6,t1_fmj93fy,1586132364.0,facts right here
exmormon,fmj8tvs,t1_fmj8oly,1586125381.0,I'll be ok. this sub has been really supportive and ive got some friends i can go to.
exmormon,fmj8oy8,t1_fmj7rr6,1586125301.0,I used to be an asshole too. i wish i could apologise to everyone I tried to convert.
exmormon,fmj8gzs,t1_fmj7p2v,1586125172.0,yeah true. im just hoping it wont be such a shitty way to go.
exmormon,fmj8dy1,t1_fmj7l3l,1586125122.0,"of course! I'm only proving i can live a happy life because i want to. I'm not planning on killing myself, thats what I'm trying to avoid."
exmormon,fmj80mg,t1_fmj6z5h,1586124902.0,I'm in the same place with my dad. hes an incredibly kind and understanding person. I've had discussion after discussion which has only made him desparate. this is him lashing out from that desperation. hes brainwashed. thank you.
exmormon,fmj7i7c,t1_fmj63ln,1586124600.0,...?
exmormon,fmj7eb4,t1_fmj1uc7,1586124537.0,thank you‚ù§

exmormon,fmj0fny,t1_fmiz7w0,1586120536.0,its not an excuse. what he said is unjustifiable but it is what it is. I was taken aback because its so unlike him to go so far. making an excuse for that would be wrong of me to do.
exmormon,fmj004t,t1_fmiy3hn,1586120300.0,more brainwashed than evil. I hope when that day comes he'll find the truth
exmormon,fmizbaz,t1_fmixjg5,1586119930.0,thankfully I have some friends I can talk to. ive been avoiding church topics altogether until I can be seen as a fully established and independent adult. by then maybe he'll see there's joy outside his church.
exmormon,fmiyzb5,t1_fmixd38,1586119742.0,it will turn out ok. I'll live a happy life outside of that cult and he'll have to accept that someday.
exmormon,fmiyuy7,t1_fmixclv,1586119671.0,"definitely too much conference. a church wouldn't make a father say that to his daughter. best of luck with your journey! take your time, study, and dont forget to take care of yourself."
exmormon,fmiyi68,t1_fmixb8z,1586119469.0,"dick? yes. also brainwashed? yeah, sadly. hes not a bad dad, just brainwashed. hes scared and thats his way of lashing out."

exmormon,fm1wmsw,t1_fm1vu5g,1585686337.0,yeah I'm going to drop it. probably til I'm completely independent and can be considered a fellow grown up.
exmormon,fm1ukqs,t1_fm1tswu,1585685277.0,I hope you're right. at this point I can't see him coming out of it. its so real to him. I'll give it time and hope for the best. I'm glad things went so well for your family in the end

exmormon,fkmwuvq,t1_fkmvz23,1584343249.0,thanks for the advice and well wishes! my dad isn't too worried about the virus. not enough that it would effect how he reacts. the virus is another reason i want to tell him. of course ive always known people die unexpectedly but recently some stuff has happened that really put it into perspective including the outbreak. its part paranoia but I dont want something to happen before I get the chance.

AskReddit,fkl31up,t3_fiueho,1584297409.0,"not a house, but a dingy motel. my dad and I had been driving for 12 hours straight. it was 2am everything was booked except a dusty motel. neither of us really minded. I was brushing my teeth when I noticed a rolled up paper behind me in the closet. it was a vintage style poster of the earths moon. probably not actually old but I think its cool."
neckbeard,fkl29xi,t3_fj4j7n,1584296933.0,it costed $0 for the original artist to not create this. it costed $0 for the neckbeard to not post this.
exmormon,fkl08g5,t1_fkkzfkn,1584295684.0,sorry about that ive been inactive for the past few days I'll take it down
exmormon,fjf687m,t1_fjf2ksz,1583285178.0,ive never heard of that. may i ask where its talked about? I'll probably find out more on Wednesday.
exmormon,fjf290p,t1_fjf20y1,1583282755.0,im not expecting much. it will probably either go perfectly fine (maybe with a few dirty looks) or be a total disaster. either way it will be fun to find out!
exmormon,fjf1wdi,t1_fjf1h2t,1583282540.0,"recording is a good idea! I would imagine they'd let me, but who knows."

exmormon,fjeh3wi,t1_fjee4bm,1583271544.0,thats sad. most of the dances ive been to just get some random guy in the presidency to dj. as you might expect its awful. i wouldn't expect them to pay ~~because... greedy bastards~~
exmormon,fjed8hr,t1_fjecixx,1583269720.0,"thanks, me too!"
exmormon,fjec1th,t1_fjebpb6,1583269060.0,thats so cool! i will ask ahead of time. even just going in a dress and dancing the night away with my girl will be fun.
exmormon,fjebx2o,t1_fjeahtb,1583268987.0,its pretty much what it sounds like. not the whole state as far as i know but it will probably be multi stake. they charge entrance because ~~they're greedy bastards~~ they will hopefully provide food and snacks? and maybe they'll pay the DJ.
exmormon,fjeblm6,t1_fjea328,1583268810.0,I'll definitely keep that in mind lol
exmormon,fjea1t7,t1_fje93l2,1583267948.0,i haven't heard that before thats interesting. maybe i could get a refund if that happens?
