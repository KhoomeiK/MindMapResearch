Do you, too, think it's okay to call a gay man a faggot if he's acting in a way you don't like?

You should never call people names, it's incredibly rude. At least argue against them, or at most say it's an ashole THING to do, whatever they did. Calling someone a slur is just never okay.

Bitch is the therm for a female dog, bastard is a child born out of wedlock. Not the same. Bastard is gender neutral.

If I'm being 'a real bitch', and somebody said 'oh you are such a bitch' , I would consider them to not be able to control their own emotions and completely irrational. If they told me that what I'm doing 'is a real asshole thing' , I would think about it and perhaps even learn something.     

There's just so much misogyny in the word bitch and even though you say it without meaning that women are less, a whole fucking history of 'hysteria' is behind it. 

Edit: I'm sorry, I didn't realize you have Asperger's. You probably had no real ill intent, but just don't realize how this is not okay. But calling others names is never okay.

If you had a daughter who got pregnant due to having sold her body to a man, I'm sure you wouldn't want people to call her a whore.

And if your wife shaved her head to make you happy, I'm sure you wouldn't want people to call her a freak.

When I was young, I was at a party and I really wanted to try something. I was a daisy-fresh girl and wanted to experience life. I met a beautiful man, and I've never had a beautiful man into me before. I was all over him.

When we went to his place, I didn't want to go at the way anyway. I just wanted to fool around a bit, but he didn't accept that. It ended up as a violent rape.

I was a virgin. I ended up losing several years of my life to that trauma, and I'm still haunted by the memory.. I was 15, he was 20. Legal in my country.

It's just to say, sometimes, you can not want to have sex, but still be all over someone. He told everybody I was just a dumb slut who regretted it. I will never heal.

Often if you don't believe things, keep it to yourself. If people wants to talk, just say that you shouldn't talk about things you don't know, and that they don't know the truth either. Protecting a person who seem very clever, shy and unfortunate isn't always the right thing. 

I was a shy nerd, he was too. He was a little quiet, funny, shy, everybody liked him. I knew of him. I'd never expect him to be like that behind closed doors. He was a honestly a cold-blooded psychopath. A year later, we had a conversation. I told him that he ruined my future sex life (somewhat of and understatement) when he raped me, and he told me ""I'm sorry"". I see this as an an admission of guilt. Like a kid on a playground who stole a toy and got caught. He also told me that I was his Lolita and he was my Humbert Humbert, which was honestly creepy as fuck."

Social heritage is very real. If your parents weren't well educated, it's very hard for you to have any merit. You might not be stupid, but a low education family will make you less inclined to get good grades. I'm sure this is to reverse that and give minorities from lower educated families a chance.

A girl from my school just got an A- on an take-home exam and failed two on-premises exams. It's just easier if you have sweet daddy who knows all the answers. If he helped her all through high school with basic math and such, no wonder she ended up with good grades even though she is mediocre at best. 

In Europe, they don't ask about ANYthing such as religion, ethnicity, gender or such. I find the religion part even more crazy. How are they supposed to use that?

However. This might not be the right way, but I'm sure this reason is sensible enough.

There are types of distortions schizophrenics get: 
Positive and Negative -
Positive is something added to reality. This is hallucinations (having some senses which are not real. See, hear, feel, taste, etc)
Delusions are also 'positive' (really just mean 'addition+'). Delusions are when you believe something that are not real (people are after you, you are Jesus, ect). These two can exist together or completely detached from each other.

Negative is feeling empty, lack of emotion, lack of memort (negative means 'minus-'), really about what you 'lose' when sick (things you can get back when better).

I think this is important and won't hurt you to know. Especially to detach yourself from the disease. You can have many difficulties, at different times, and still have schizophrenia. Mostly, it's just about 'constantly' having some of these (every day, or at least many times a week).

Small, popcultural twists, but the exactly the same essence. Sorry, but every teen thinks ""now this is worse, my shameful generation, it's never been this bad"".

TooAfraidToAsk,flov0u3,t3_fq19ob,1585346048.0,"I think it's because of how society is deep in, hear me out:

A woman's duty is to carry the man's offspring. The only worth of that woman is to serve and birth his children. When a woman miscarry, she cannot fulfill her duty, and she is a disappointment to her master, ahem, I mean husband.

I don't believe that is right or even agree slightly. About 60% of pregnancies end in miscarriage, but most are very early on. You body is so smart and knows whether the child would be well or not.

Us women are constantly made to feel shameful and worth only what the man wants. I think it's important to acknowledge, so we can get rid of it. Your body knew it was the right choice, even though it hurts a lot. We are not stepford wives and we are worth so much even when we miscarry. I'm sure you have a good and healthy body, and it was just not right this time, and your body knew. Don't let yourself get shamed into thinking you are only worth your ability to birth tons of offspring. Don't let yourself get hushed into silence and shame."

schizophrenia,flmr0dg,t3_fpns0q,1585293076.0,"I'd say stress with a touch of hypochondria.

Those ""hallucinations"" are normal and are honestly not like a psychotic hallucination.

I'd say you should not get tested. You sounds like you suddenly feel like ""oh I guess yes"" if they ask you if you feel a certain way and you are unsure. You sound like a completely normal teenager and would at most get a misdiagnose.

When I got sick I could not read, I could not talk, I could not think or see other people. I had heavy visual hallucinations the first time around, heavy tactile the second. I tried to kill myself numerous times in the beginning, because I couldn't make sense of anything. 

Everybody wants to fit in somewhere. You feel weird and out of place. This is a place where people are weird and out of place. But honesly, hormones, pressure from friends and school, parents with expectations are hard and can affect you this way."

relationships,flg1hl9,t1_flfzljp,1585126551.0,"Doing nice things is doing the dishes or the laundry when you don't want to. Don't ever do sexual things for the other person without wanting it, too. It's really hard as a teenager, but as you grow older, it gets easier. Sex is fun, healthy and amazing when it's good. Don't be afraid to want things! But yes, at your own terms. You seem to really hear and understand, and that's really good. You deserve to be happy and comfortable :)"

relationships,flfvyo4,t1_fleq5n6,1585119929.0,"I ""knew"" David would never hurt me. He was so sweet, shy and kind. Quite gentle and very beautiful.

He obviously already borderline assaulted you. I'm pretty lax with what is rape. I was 'fully' raped, and when people say they were raped because they felt some kind of social pressure or such, I always feel angry. A true, full rape is the most horrifying thing to experience. Of course different types of assault can be hurtful too, but I never take the word rape in vain. Never.

And with that, this is not teenage drama. No matter how soft your 'no's where, how playful he seemed, trying to force your tits out in the park is not a little thing. This is quite serious. This is not a little silly thing. Don't tell yourself it doesn't matter. It's a very very clear red flag and a sign that he does not respect your boundaries or body — even in public! Thats scary as hell. You're young, and still somewhat inexperienced. Take this from someone with many years of dating, playing, going to kink clubs and experimenting with any kind of sex there is. This is a big big nono. I've once given a hand job in a maze in a park when I was your age. There's nothing wrong with experimenting. But everybody has to be in on it. I felt like fun and sexy and dangerous in a good way afterwards. Because I wanted to. Its not a ""well he wanted it, so I guess it's not a big deal"". You should want it just as much. You shouldn't convince yourself you want it, just because it makes someone else happy. Experiment, but only on your own terms!

I hope this can give you a little insight and perhaps help you to not have the same hurts as me."
