If you feel like you can't get off unless you're force feeding someone then that's not normal and you should seek help.

Bdsm is about immediate pain and playing with physical pain during sex. force feeding however is pretty gross and the idea of bulking someone up makes me feel like it's just about a power play and can very easily become abusive. And I might even say that, in every case of force feeding as a kink, it is a form of abuse because the person doing it is trying to belittle the other over a presumably long period of time for sexual gain.

And even if you haven't reached it, even if you aren't there yet, at least you're better off because you tried.

2meirl4meirl,fo6no6o,t1_fo6m0xe,1587563096.0,"Yeah but you have to start somewhere, or split things up a little. Like for example I want to be a film director, but obviously to get to the level I want to get to with it will take years and also luck so it's very difficult. But what I've done now is make a general plan so that whatever comes my way I can still be making films to some extent and at least be part of the industry even if in a very small way. Whilst my overall plan is to become a film director, my goal rn is to get a film into a festival. It's much more realistic and the time frame doesn't feel too daunting. This plan also means the disappointment of not reaching the end goal won't be so crushing, because I'll still have loads to be proud of. I guess to me it should be more about the journey than the destination in a way. 

I know it might not be so easy to segment things for every life goal or career goal or whatever it is you want to do, but if you can I think it's incredibly helpful and makes you appreciate your achievements as you go on. But you have to start somewhere, and even though rn things are very restricting you can try and turn the situation into a positive and make it into a chance to plan and think about what it is exactly you want and how you'll get there. But it has to be baby steps and you have to make it so each step is realistic whilst also being satisfying to your life."

In my case for example, I'm a severely suicidal and depressed person but I choose to defy it and work towards something positive. I have my down days but when I don't I try to make the most of my slightly less depressed moods and use that time to make myself feel happy and lead to a place where that's maintained for longer periods. I'm doing that through working on my future career options and raising my chances of being in a career I'll enjoy. Because doing that makes me happy and optimistic and if nothing else is at least enjoyable to work through because I'm passionate about it, whilst doing nothing doesn't help at all. Sometimes you should do nothing, but don't do nothing all the time because that's just a waste of life and potential. Identify what you want then work out where to start then go from there. At least try."
