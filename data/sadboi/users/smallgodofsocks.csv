As far as results- absolutely!

Before I started I’d been having a lot of big acne flares, which were new to me as I’d have pretty clear skin most of my life.  I’d tried OTC salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide with no results.  

Also, from aging my skin was a lot more textured on my cheeks, and I had a fair amount of light skin spots that just sort of made my skin look muddy.  

The tret completely ended the texture issues and my acne is under control now.  The skin spots have all disappeared, and the lines next to my mouth have faded some (not completely, I’d need filler for that).

You asked about tret and sunscreen, but here is my routine, as well.

AM, I always wash my face.  I use cetaphil gentle foaming cleanser, because it doesn’t feel like it’s stripping my face.  Boscia rosewater mist and then immediately hyuralonic acid serum.  15 minutes later I moisturize (I use various ones so I’m not sure it matter which one).  Then replenix sunscreen when I touch my face and don’t “feel” the moisturizer any longer.

PM, wash with the cetaphil, then put on tret.  If it’s the gel I spray the Boscia liberally about an hour and a half after.  

I only added the boscia after switching to the gel.  (I switched doctors and that is the version they prescribed.  Didn’t realize until I got home and figured I’d use it up.  Super drying!)"
tretinoin,fomzq4z,t1_fohdspp,1587908587.0,"I can share mine.  I am in my 40s.  I currently use and started at .025% at night.  I’ve been on it a little over a year.  

I have used both gel and cream and prefer the cream because I found the gel very drying immediately after putting it on.  I started twice a week for two weeks, then three for two, then every other day for a month before going to every day.  

I tried several sunscreens and really like Replenix sheer physical sunscreen cream spf 50 plus. It’s the only one that doesn’t leave my face shiny or feel slick.  I don’t work outside."

Ok, so, once the curves “end” on these charts, we could see a new curve start up again as people stop socially distancing/go back to work/etc. in June-August.

I’m hopeful there will also be a widely available antibody test, that might help people (those who take it) feel more comfortable with decisions to move about.  Thoughts on that?

Havanese,fl7wisn,t3_fn6qdd,1584910883.0,"I have a hav/poodle mix.  (We didn’t crate train.)

We intentionally built up the time we were away.  

We would give a kong with treat and long lasting bone and put him in a large toddler pen in the living room while we were still there for a few minutes at a time.  Then we’d leave the room and immediately come back.  Then we’d leave the room for longer.  We built up to leaving the house and coming right back in.  Staying outside for a few minutes then coming back.  Short trips to get gas, etc. 

Also, you didn’t ask, but I am a very light sleeper so, as much as I wanted to, I did not have him in my bed.  He is in a small toddler pen in the floor by my bed, and has been since the first night.  He whined for a little bit the first night, but I just pet him for a few minutes and made loving sounds.  That was it.  

He was fine re: separation.  No whining or barking.  We don’t leave him more than 3 hours, though but he’s be ok I’d guess.  

What do I love?  He’s basically amazing.  He is super smart and easy to train.  He is not crazy with food so I don’t need to worry about that. He is confident and loves other dogs.  He is great at the dog park.  He is a watch dog, but open up the door and he’s ready to lick them and play.  He is super gentle with the kids.  He and one of the cats play games together.  I just love him.

Good luck!"
