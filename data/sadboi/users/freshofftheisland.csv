AskReddit,fq05ajh,t1_fpya6zw,1589027778.0,The same thing happened to me for years until I started taking birth control and since I have never experienced that pain again. I think my doctor said something about it being a hormone I'm balance that was corrected by the birth control.
mixedrace,fpu5fgi,t1_fpu4u6j,1588905058.0,"The thing is they have no idea what they're talking about. They're just black girls who have been jealous if biracial girls their who lives. They dont know how it feels to have you identity decided by every single person you meet. They dont know how it feels to not fit into any racial group and have constant comments and peoples opinions on your identity. To have your identity ""change"" because people cant decide ""what you are""."
mixedrace,fpu4ljg,t3_gfka2c,1588904544.0,"This is bullshit. She's projecting her own jealousy on mixed people. Mixed people are a fetish to some people but that doesn't equal privilege. I dont deny mixed people have mode privileges than dark skins but we have a whole other types of identity issues. Shes invalidating and experience she has never had because she thinks mixed people have too much privilege to be saying anything. Its true we're not ""black"" enough or ""white"" enough, that doesnt change just because black men praise biracial features. Being considered beautiful and having nice features does not take away the other struggles we go through. Black people will think biracial people are more beautiful but still deny them their identity."
