depression,fbktmxl,t3_edpkii,1576955240.0,"Often times I'll find myself feeling a certain way and I hate myself for it. This usually comes out as anger, or just pure rage. I usually self medicate and in my drunken stupor I'll ""punish"" myself by hitting something solid so as to only cause myself damage. Last time I went outside to have a good cry and as punishment for my jealousy I headbutted a tree twice, threw up and passed out in the rain. I've been trying my hardest to avoid that sick part of my psyche since then."
