Your boss and coworkers are people just like you. Not any better of a person than you. They are just people... For some reason that has always stuck with me and made life easier. From 1 person to 50 people. They are all just people just like you. Just because they get paid more doesnt make them anymore important than you are.

Tell someone close to you or go to the E.R. if you are thinking about suicide.

I agree with the liberal evil and bullshit but as a Californian my despise of Texas came after serving my time in the Navy. Your state is hot and humid,your beaches are ugly, Texmex is trash, you think whataburger is good food when its just another burger King, your food portions are disgustingly big leading to a 33%  obesity rate, you dont have mountains or beautiful beaches, its a large desert,  you tried to leave the union, marijuana is illegal in 2019. I'm sure I could think of some other things but I'll stop there.

Good things from Texas; your people are friendly and nice and welcoming everywhere ive gone, living is affordable, armadillos, oil!, guns!."
