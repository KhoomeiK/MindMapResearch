LifeProTips,fhabv1y,t3_f1z2fc,1581403798.0,"I feel like this isn't always possible. I have a friend who dissociates a lot. I could send messages, be that about how much I care, or sharing something i know they will appreciate and they may not even read the messages for 3 weeks because they're in a really bad place.

I still tell them I'm here when they want to talk again, that i don't mind and i dont want to harrass them because theres like 200 messages from me unread and i look like the needy one.

It's not like i can just up and go round to see them as they're on the other side of the country, and its inappropriate to just turn up on someones doorstepand. Isn't exactly easy when you have work commitments or dont have the money for travel either.

Without all that sounding like excuses - What's the LPT for these situations, and the people that now feel like a POS because they can't do anything for the people they really do care about?"

I joined a few clubs outside of school but consistently gave then up after a few weeks because i was always the oldest in the class and it felt weird.

I'd be an entirely different person if i had just kept up with a sport - sports give you confidence and interpersonal skills. I have only just started to learn these skills because of the job I am in - if i didn't learn them in time, i would have lost my job. The world is cruel to shy/awkward/introverted people."
AskReddit,fg14r1e,t1_fg09xjn,1580420721.0,"This brings back one of my fondest memories because it was such an overreaction!

When I was a child (between 9/10 years old) we would go and stay at a static caravan park that was by the beach - i remember it being super posh looking.

Edit: Park from here on out refers to lile playground/swings and all that jazz...

My older brother (by a few years) and I would go to the park together, it was a pretty safe environment, security everywhere and lots of kids. Being the uncool younger sibling, i was left alone to play with kids my own age whilst my brother went to play rough with some boys he had met.

I tried to make friends, was invited back to a girls caravan to play Top Trumps, of course i joined, who wouldn't? It was legit like a meter away from the park apparatus.

Hours pass. My brother hasn't come to get me. My parents don't know where i am. I should go back now. I leave. I walk the 3 makeshift roads to my home away from home. I see a family member crying hysterically - ""why are you crying?""

There was this big holy shit moment where theyre like ""Where have tou been, omg youre okay, i need to let your mum know shes out there looking for you!!!""

Apparently i had been abducted and security and my parents were off gallavanting trying to find me, and here i am waiting for my dinner like ""im hungry, i don't understand why youre all crying, this isnt a big deal i was just playing top trumps?""

1) This place was huge - why didnt they start at the park? I was literally sat in the window of a caravan facing the damn area. They would have found me instantly!!

 2) It was a mega safe place, if it wasn't, we wouldn't have been left without parental supervision. My mum wasn't that neglectful lol.

I can't begin to imagine my mums panic when she saw my brother without me in tow, but it's more funny than anything to me.

TLDR; Accidentally on purpose let myself get abducted to play Top Trumps and had security looking for me for several hours :)"

My go to is sci-fi. I absolutely love space and technology, why not write the book you really want to read?

I write poetry to relieve stress, I did write another awful poem as a kid which was published - about my best friend with the apple-blond hair. If i could remove that from existence I would in a heartbeat haha!

52book,fcwqvd8,t1_fcwmyvx,1578034043.0,"Most of the Graphic novels I have bought and really enjoyed were quite dark or sci fi, but to take from my mixed pool of highly rated (4/5*) ...

Oblivion Song by Robert Kirkman - This is quite dark and a little horrifying, I'd say it was more of a Sci Fi Horror.

Lady Mechanika by Joe Benitez - If you like Steampunk settings you will enjoy this series!

Rose by Meredith Finch - This was a compulsive buy for me because of the cover, but I loved the plot. It is Fantasy.

Monstress by Marjorie M. Liu - Set in a Fantasy/Steampunk world where there are humans and Arcanics who essentially have Animalistic features. (Hard to describe without giving the plot away aha!)

The Old Guard by Greg Rucka - This was recommended to me by my local Comic Book Store. Set in the normal world, a selection of people face death in their own timeline (past and present) and find out they can't die. This was fun for me, to see that even humans who had lived for thousands of years, struggle to understand modern technology!

52book,fcvbqq8,t3_egrbs2,1577998768.0,"Hello!

I have been taking part in Goodreads challenges for several years now, during my first years I pledged maybe 20 books, now my TBR is growing out of control and my pledge is 100. 

In 2019 I managed to read a whopping 92/100 books. I count Audio, Graphic Novels, Short Story Bindups etc within reason (I count issues, not single comics because they're too short to me).

I want to take part in more community driven reading this year and so will hopefully be reading a lot of new releases, although I do also have a long Goodreads list of my 2020 TBR books to grab at.

Overwatch, Netflix and Candle Making keep me away from my books far too often and so I have also pledged this year to make time each night to read even if it's a single chapter.

I have already started this years challenge with 2 Graphic Novels : Monstress Volume 3 & Isola Volume 1. I wanted my first book or the year to be shorter as i have a lot or long reads and didnt want to be demotivated - still want to read The Priory of The Orange Tree though bahaha.

My next read will be one of the following:

My Name is Monster by Katie Hale
Lifelike by Jay Kristoff
The Institute by Stephen King

Fast forward a few hours, we are at the high school  I'm feeling ten times worse, but I middle through it. We get through our work, start to line up by the door ready to leave.

It took all of ten seconds for everything to go downhill - I raise my hand to ask to go to the bathroom, urgency in my voice as I know I'm about to spew. I'm pretty sure I was told that I could go as we walked past to exit the building or something.

Well that wasnt good enough, my best friend at the time was stood in front of me in the line and without being able to even throw my hand up to my mouth or redirect to somewhere else, I vomited in her hair. We were both then rushed to the bathroom on the other side of the building, I vomit on the stairwell heading into the corridor and then once I got to the bathroom I was perfectly fine and was ready to go home ðŸ˜‡

My mum had to collect me and take me to work with her for the rest of the day, I spent the last hours switching between sitting on the disabled restroom floor with my head in the toilet and licking the sticky parts of envelopes closed ready for the post.
