mentalhealth,flnvsoz,t3_fplncz,1585326820.0,"Life isnt a race. No one knows when it ends, no one knows what's going to happen. Being ahead of other ppl will secure you in some ways, but it's not everything. You own your life. You dont have to compare yourself with others. You just go with ur own pace. It's ur life. U create ur world.


I am 23 and i took years off from univ due to my mental problems(suicidal thoughts and depression). All my friends r graduated but still i am a student. I lost 2 years, but i actually really appreciate myself for overcomming the hardest time. I learned lessons hard way and i can never trade that with anything. People think i just threw out the most important 2 years of my life. I dont care. Anyways i am alive and im grateful.

I know im still kinda young and there will be more ppl who are way more successful than me as i grow older. But its their lives. I live my life. I am happy and thats all that matters. Everyone dies but no one knows when. So stop comparing urself with others and just live ur life and be happy at the moment. Cuz thats the goal in the end. Hope u have a wonderful day."

relationships,f07fhsf,t1_f06mcfq,1568459936.0,"Do u live in Asia? Cuz i am half Korean myself and saying i love u too quickly sounds like an East asain culture to me.
But even in Korea, saying i love you even before u meet each other in person and going to a Motel for the first date seems very weird. People dont really get afraid of the L word here and they seem to say it more casually, but that doesnt mean that this situation is common. I get that the cultural difference could be confusing, but in the end we all r just the same humans. If a guy really likes u, u wont have to doubt that. Regardless of culture."
relationships,f065fjq,t3_d3ta3n,1568429729.0,"OP, i dont know if u had other romantic relationships, but this is not one. I gotta say, u sound way too innocent for a 25 yo girl... if i were in that situation i wouldve ghosted him when he said i love u unless i wanted to have sex with him. I mean, you cant be that oblivious.."
relationships,ew0mnph,t3_cm6ljg,1564996556.0,"Its not important what other people think. To me, seeing each other 1-3 times a week is pretty frequent. Whats important is whether your needs are met or not. If you are not satisfied with ur pattern, have a conversation with her. Try to avoid being passive agressive or guilt tripping her tho cuz in this case, there is no normal or abnormal. I personally text my friends more often because i prefer talking with my SO in person, and if not, by a phone call. In my opinion texting too often makes conversations dull. You both are different people and you need to compromise. And you both are normal."

Advice,eos1w4a,t3_bsvuhk,1558816391.0,"I am so so sorry for your loss. I lost 2 people last year and it got me crazy. I became suicidal as well. I tried to get better and ignore my intense feelings and thats what made me insane. Feel all your feelings. Grieve. Dont expect to be better soon. Cry your eyes out. Time will heal everything eventually. And please, don't blame yourself. I'm pretty sure thats the last thing your gf wanted. 

You are a strong human being. You will get better eventually. I wish i could give you a hug. :("
