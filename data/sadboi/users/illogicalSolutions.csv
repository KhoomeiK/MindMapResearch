depression,fppaz53,t3_gea6mo,1588799014.0,Seeing this extremely late but it‚Äôs as if Reddit was listening to my meeting I just had with my management at my job. They‚Äôve notice I‚Äôve been different and it‚Äôs because my depression has been growing and this post struck a nerve because holy fuck is it ever more depressing than realizing this. I look at somebody as my best friend but I know he doesn‚Äôt look back at me the same way and it fucking blows. I‚Äôm nobody‚Äôs best friend. Nobody comes to me to talk about their problems or their accomplishments. I‚Äôm just a person a lot of people know. It fucking sucks.
