2. I will not be forced to go to said cunt to get the basic necessity's to survive. Like heating, dish soap, toilet paper, Ect.
3. I demand the right to a job. Or a income I should not be forced into a life of abuse to a worthless cunt because there's no employment in my area. Since I do not qualify for unemployment insurance, and I have been forced to be abused for half a year now I am holding my life hostage."

So I guess I'll just have to have faith, and continue down the path I'm on"
SuicideWatch,fpmlgfm,t1_fpmjweh,1588735702.0,"I'm not depressed. I have BPD. So I have the occasional mood swing, and depression is part of that. But this decision to kill myself is because I am running out of options. It is the final cry for help, and the consequences of not receiving the help I need will be my sucide. A sucide I will get right this time, a sucide that is calmly, and logically thought out.


I usually lay in bed, talk to a friend, play some video games, watch a movie, and other thing's if I am having the overwhelming feeling to kill myself. Now see there's the difference, this sucide I will commit if thing's don't change is based on wise mind, and logically thought through. It's not a impulsive thing, it's not something based on weeks of feeling down, and thing's like that. It's litterly me holding myself at gun point threatening to kill my HOSTAGE if my demands are not met.

Again me wanting to kill myself is because I have hope, it's a threat to everyone else that I will take this persons life, aka mine, if thing's do not get better. I am in treatment currently for my illness, yet thing's aren't improving far from it they are getting worse because a abuser controls my life. My counselor fails to grasp the seriousness of the situation, and so I am using the real threat if my death to try to make her realize how serious this is, I don't have the time or the patience to look for another counselor, because that will be used against me by my abuser. My abuser is painting me into a corner, and like any animal in a corner I will lash out eventually. I do not want to ruin my life by killing someone, so I will end my life before that happens, and the people who should understand the situation should know, and if not I'm going to do everything I can to get my counselor fired even if that means taking my own life. 


Side note. I do not want to kill myself, I don't have the desire, but I'm going to do it.


Your right I'm not going to let the evil win, I'm taking my life back from that evil, it will not control my life anymore. My life is in my hand, And I'm in Jesus's hand. I have faith that he won't allow me to kill my, and that thing's will get infinitely better before that ever happens. I can't keep going ghrough the storm if I'm tied up to the sail of someone trying to throw me to the bottom of the sea, and so im not letting that happen, I will litterly throw myself into the storm like Johna, and hopefully God will send a fish to save me."

Ok I tried to find a way with my mom yesterday. Ok so this is what happened.

I talked to my counselors about disability there's a chance I won't get it. So I went to my mom to discuss the chance that I wouldn't get disability, it turned imidiatly into a 2 hour argument that she started. I was seriously just looking for help, and trying to talk about options.

So for 2 hours I was criticized, for 2 hours I was told my diagnosis is wrong. For two hours I was being told I'm so mentally ill I do not see reality. She literally got on her nees screaming to jesus about how he's the only person who will be able to help me. 

Why would jesus be the only person able to help me? Because clearly she doesn't want to help me, or even discuss my problems. 

She then said ""I will not help you with money, I will not help you with a Job, I will not help you with transportation."" 

I don't have options, and so I'm going to end up hurting myself. I can nit continue to live in this situation, because I tried to talk to her yesterday guess what?

Now I don't have tooth paste. I dont have soap or shampoo. I cant do laundy, or dishes. I can't get medication. I can't buy Dog food. Not only am I suffering but now my Pitbull I adopted is going to suffer under her abuse.

SuicideWatch,fpltd4t,t1_fpls5pf,1588719093.0,"Let's see where tooo start. I moved out of my parents house as soon as I could, I then started struggling because of the Undiagnosed mental illness, I tried to commit suicide, then my mom manipulated me into moving back in with her, she kicked me out that same week, The mental illness continued to get worse, she tried manipulating my doctor's into saying I'm bipolar, I started going to the doctors on my own, they dignosed me with BPD, I kept trying to fight the doctor's because of the illness, after I got 3 opinions I finally broke, and admitted that I have BPD. I could keep a Job to save my life clearly because I wouldn't be in this situation if I could. So because my mom was supporting me, and refused to support me in getting a Job I ended up homeless again. I got a trail, managed to keep a job for 9 months, my mom was out of my life that whole time, I didn't have the means to see a doctor yet, couldn't get medical because I was still on my parents Insurance, I lost that Job, ended up Homeless again, checked myself into the hospital because I was going to kill myself. I made a friend they offered to take me in but because there life was falling apart that didn't last long, it was long enough for me to get on me feet, then I had a car accident, and I ended up being supported by my abusive parents again. They refuse to support me getting a Job, they refuse to support me getting medication, they try to deny the Dignosis I got on my own. They have me a prisoner in a rural town, I have to walk half a mile just to get groceries. I have food stamps so I can buy food lucky for myself but that's it.



I have been beaten by them, I have been choked, I have pictures of the bruises to prove that. Because of the area I live in there's a supply, and demand issues, there's a huge supply of workers, and no demand for work. So I can't get a Job. I have been trying to get treatment for the illness for months to no avial. So I'm holding myself hostage, if this shit doesn't change im going to kill myself"

I litterly don't even have enough money for food without this abusive relationship, food stamps aren't enough, and this stupid fucking virus has the only place that helps people out with food in my rural town closed down. Plus I would have no way to even get the food they give me home, I would get a fraction of what I need because it would be a 6 Mile walk, and I can't get a Job no matter how badly I want one because of the rural fucking area I live in. The only way my life will get better is if I had the capacity to move out of a rural area which I don't. So I am litterly forced into a abusive relationship where I am constantly mistreated, where I am constantly being abused just to survive, and everyone expects me to just go along with it. I want to fucking die because of this bullshit, and death seems like the best fucking option. Like seriously. I can't even get drug's to numb this bullshit.

So I go to my mom to have a conversation about this, and I started with that. Hey just talked to my counselor ect. Ect. Ect. I forgot this is my narracistict mother we are talking about, and so she's busy staring at the computer screen instead of talking to me. I don't quite remember how thing's got so out of hand, I definitely had a part in things escalating so quickly because of my emotions. Seriously I'm trying to discuss getting a job, how the fuck does that turn into a argument? Well it did, and my mom proceeded for the mext hour to tell me how helpless I am. That she can't talk to me about getting a job, how she's the victim of my mental illness, and at one point she litterly in the most dramatic way possible got on her hands, and nees screaming to Jesus to help me. Like I'm a believer, but I thought it was dramatic, and this lady owns 4 houses. Is arguing how she can't help me, and I was seriously just trying to discuss getting a job with her. She then continued to scream in my face about how I'm not trying to get help, that I am actively fighting with doctor's to not get help, and all of this bullshit that's so easily provable how wrong she is. There was so much gaslighting from her, and she litterly lives in this made up world were she can do no wrong. So because I tried to do something positive to improve my life, I now am not going to be able to do laundry, have shampoo, or soap, and do dishes because food stamps doesn't pay for that. She cut me out of her life again, and two months ago she's litterly crying that I'm going to leave her once I get my property back from her house.

We can go back thousands of year's, and women have held the most power in society.

BPDmemes,fmqj5td,t1_fmqiiy1,1586300634.0,"I litterly made myself homeless at the advice of a doctor, there's clearly no reasonable argument that could be made that I am not 100% onboarding for getting treatment, and that same doctor kept denying me DBT classes. I had to ask her repeatedly, and every time she would come up with a lie, and blame me. Things have escalated so far that I am at the point where I don't even believe I have a mental illness, and that BPD is a mental illness. I believe BPD is a logical response to a shitty situation. I'm not taking anyone's bullshit anymore. If I'm going to shout what I think to the world, and I don't give a fuck who gets upset. My counselor started to pull the same bullshit my doctor was doing, and she started to be a rude interrupting bitch when I tried to talk about the shit I am thinking about. I know for a fact that she is using a mental illness label against me because the sheriff's showed up at my house soon after that phone call."
BPDmemes,fmqhr2v,t1_fmqf6rt,1586299851.0,"I reached that point like this week, I realized after 3 year's of trying to get treatment,  trying to live my life, and having other people at every turn stop me. I kinda said fuck it, I'm taking everything into my own hands, and fuck what anyone thinks. So I started making Facebook posts, and I haven't stopped. It's interesting to use the word sucide, and talking about how there's a chance that I could commit it in the future. Sooooo many people who come out pretending to care, and it's making me very cynical."

dating,fmmezeb,t1_fmmeh59,1586204064.0,"Your right, people do think it's a choice, and I think schizophrenics are a perfect example of how it's not a choice. Since they have that perception they get super critical of you, and then they expect us to act in a specific way then get angry when we don't meet there beliefs. I have had so many arguments with people over my mental health, and it's always some bullshit blaming me. That I'm not doing enough l, and so forth."
dating,fmmb5iy,t1_fmmahzr,1586202119.0,"Thank you for the encouragement l appreciate it, and your right it's difficult. I get some much sympathy without people listening to what I'm saying, and today I had the sheriff's show up to my door because I said the word sucide. I was expressing my anger to my counselor, after she interrupted me several times I expressed how if thing's don't change it could lead to me killing myself in the future, and that was enough for the person who rudely interrupted me from expressing myself called the cops on me for my expression of anger"

MensLib,fmm7acw,t1_fmm0gdm,1586200099.0,"Society hates men, I have BPD, and because of it I am not allowed to Express my anger in any healthy way because I have a mental illness. I was expressing my anger this morning with my counselor about my situation, she repeatedly tried to interrupt me, and then called the sheriff on me because I talked about how if my situation doesn't change I can have a breakdown that could lead to me killing myself. But because I expressed my anger, and have a label I wasn't listened to, and had the cop's show up to my house"
dating,fmm4xvm,t1_fmm3vc2,1586198870.0,"You definitely don't know how I feel, and the only thing I have any control over is me. I don't have any control over my life, and I lost that due to a illness. I live in a rural area, without a car, I can't get a job without a car, and I can't get a car without a job. My best friend is literally offering to give me most for a car because he understands how fucked my situation is, and I was extremely grateful. Then i thought about it. And realized how pointing that is. It wouldn't help me get out of this hell hole that my abusive parents put me in, and before you get all crazy on me telling me what I can do. I have been in this position for 2 year's, and I have had quite a lot of time to think about what I can do. The only option I have left is to talk openly about my struggles, and whatever comes into my mind on public forms like Facebook. I had to talk to the sheriff this morning, because someone got upset about me talking about the reality of my situation, and how if it doesn't change there's a very high probability of a mental breakdown where I kill myself. I know some people will think I'm using that as a cry for help, to to be manipulative so whatever I can't change there opinions, and I am very angry when people try to be sympathetic. Because I'm not looking for that, and I hope my actions speak louder then the word's people are misconstruing."

You really habe nothing better to do than try to amuse yourself, and trying to force someone into looking delusional? So the definition of delusional mean ""an idiosyncratic belief or impression that is firmly maintained despite being contradicted by what is generally accepted as reality or rational argument, typically a symptom of mental disorder."" So if we both agree my post, and the OP post is cringe, then how am I being delusional, and I feel like your argument's are more inline with that definition."

What value are you getting out of this? What's your goal, and motivation for this? How is this helping people on here anymore then my post? Cringe as it may be I feel like you can still find value in a post like that, and it's highly dependent on your view point. For example say you have a tendency for over think things like I do, and having a 4 step guid could be highly valuable. Instead of a multi paragraph guide it's a keep it simple stupid kind of thing."
seduction,fm5kmik,t1_fm5k3s7,1585774702.0,"If there's nothing wrong with a guied then it can't be cringe because being cringe would mean there's something wrong, and everyone getting upset because I shortened tue guid to 4 simple steps, in my opinion is a reflection of how the people feel about themselves, and I feel that all the negative backlash is because of the emotions around it. There's no secret method to texting womenz, and it's pretty cringey in my opinion."
seduction,fm5jx4r,t1_fm5jqcg,1585774332.0,"Well yes, if a guide to how to text is cringe, and then a simplified 4 step version is just as cringe. So why direct that hate twords me, and not be in agreement that this whole post is just cringe?"
