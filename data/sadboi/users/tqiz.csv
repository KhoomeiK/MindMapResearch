It’s their battlefield, not ours, so let this person make all the ignorant comments they want. It’s when you engage a stupid person is when you make what they say relevant and give them a platform."

Did you hear the emotional blackmail by him? He asked if they could work it out and when he didn’t get the answer he liked, he went on to say he was basically going to shame her publicly by showing the video to her family and friends. Also said he’s going to put it on YouTube and Facebook to basically humiliate her. Dude you are butthurt af! To me this is why your weak ass got cheated on to begin with. 

So the real question is why do people step outside their relationship for their emotional and sexual needs to begin with? The answer is because you are NOT doing your job or you didn’t want it to begin with.

Since marriage is a legal contract she was wrong to start “hiring” for new employees before divorcing him."
