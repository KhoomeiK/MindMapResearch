QueensCollege,fpb2l1a,t1_focykf7,1588460784.0,"I think you’re putting all of us in quite a general form. You do not have to like all of us, of course. But just cause it seems like we hurt others and take, doesn’t mean we are not allowed the same things as you do. There’s always going to be the bad people. And there’s always going to be the good people. No need to be so racist here. I understand where you’re coming from, but there’s no need for this."
CoronavirusUS,flykvwp,t3_frzg8n,1585604059.0,"It’s going to be alright. Don’t worry.
It’s such a shame that Asian hate is growing but don’t mind the dumb racists. The virus is absolutely nothing compared to the fast spreading hate. 

I think we just have to look at all of this as a time to come together and stay strong. The virus will die out eventually. People are always looking for a way to blame each other. 

It’s going to be okay."

QueensCollege,fjb39xx,t1_fj88o0k,1583185628.0,"Thank you so much, man. 
Just stay safe out there. A lot of people tend to go crazy under paranoia, the hype, the whole galore. Not that I blame people for being scared, but someone’s ignorance is not justified by this situation. 
Take care!"
QueensCollege,fhnl42v,t1_fhmot8m,1581728317.0,Thank you so much for being so kind. Stay safe too
QueensCollege,fhmmdkx,t1_fhm6c4q,1581714922.0,"Agreed. I didn’t mean to cause any panic of some sort. If I did, then I truly apologize. I just wanted to put this out there."

She’s incredibly sweet and has a special talent. She managed to describe a friend of mine in an oddly accurate manner without any details or photos. She only needs questions, no backstory"
QueensCollege,fgr8b1o,t1_fgr7ur8,1581040605.0,"My apologies. I corrected my response. I’m sorry, girl. You take care of yourself anyways okay?"
QueensCollege,fgr87pk,t1_fgqvy6d,1581040540.0,"Yeah. Let’s try to stay safe and protect each other. Even though some people can be cruel, we shouldn’t fight back just as cruelly. The important thing is to stay kind. Otherwise, it defeats the purpose."

QueensCollege,fgr7spk,t1_fgqq91y,1581040251.0,It’s okay. I never been physically attacked or anything. But I just wanted to address this.
QueensCollege,fgr7r2r,t1_fgqy5te,1581040219.0,"That’s okay, you don’t have to like Asians or anything. What I’m saying is to be safe and respect each other. I’m not trying to force my ideas into others. But I think deep down, you must have faced a lot of hurt too. Even though you don’t care and may not value my life, I do value yours.
I don’t think you’re a bad person deep down. Maybe you’ve been through things too. I’m sorry you feel that way, girl."
QueensCollege,fgp0jy1,t1_fgokhej,1580993531.0,"I guess it’s towards mostly Asians, maybe I should have worded that better. Since the virus is said to be from Wuhan, people have been targeting the Chinese and even Asians as a whole general. But yes, not just Asians alone, anyone who also been in or out of China or Flushing Main Street"
QueensCollege,fgp0d2w,t1_fgoyu6r,1580993420.0,"Yeah, the media really loves to hype things up. All of us, not just Asians have to stay safe. Anything can happen. I just feel that since QC is a diverse college, we still need to uphold the values, standards and respect."

QueensCollege,fgp032p,t1_fgoufq8,1580993249.0,"That’s true and all. However anyone can be infected, and it’s not right to make assumptions based on an Asian wearing a surgical mask. Just cause they have a surgical mask on, it doesn’t mean they simply have that virus already. It’s possible he or she had a common cold before or are just trying to prevent it."
QueensCollege,fgocofm,t1_fgocbjl,1580965715.0,"I understand. But I still feel this really needs to be said. Stay safe man. I’m not trying to cause a movement or anything but this really needed to be addressed since people have been making sneers, comments and also some derogatory comments about “Asians having Coronavirus” in QC campus. I’m just hoping it all dies down soon"
QueensCollege,fgo8nqw,t1_fgo8302,1580962541.0,We got each other. Stay safe.
QueensCollege,fgo4m7x,t1_fgo4enr,1580959661.0,"Yep, that’s true. 
It’s just that things have been blowing up real bad across the world. Haha, stay safe man."

QueensCollege,fgnysye,t1_fgnyk1n,1580955892.0,"No, I’m trying to explain that there’s been a lot of weird looks that Asians have been getting since people have been afraid of the virus. It’s not just funny looks either, I’ve seen few cases of actual racism against the Asian students here. I’ve actually seen people poke and point out that Corona Viruses are all over Flushing and that Chinese students/other Asians might need to be carefully avoided, stuff like “Go back to China, chink,” “Watch out for the Asians.”
It’s usually a disgusted glare or they stare at me weird and whisper. I hope my post didn’t offend or bother you man. It’s all good.

Also I saw you like biking, can you recommend a nice model? Been wanting to bike and lose weight too. I hope you reach your weight goal man. Let’s encourage each other."
QueensCollege,fgnvqfq,t1_fgnvkfz,1580953941.0,Exactly. It’s all the hype from the media. People don’t understand that Corona Virus is an umbrella term for multiple common viruses such as the COMMON COLD.

depression,famjfuk,t3_e9wz2s,1576205319.0,"I’m so sorry for your loss. 
Yeah, you’re definitely in a grieving process. Please don’t push yourself too much, it’s totally normal to grieve and put things off for a while. 
Some days you’ll remember all the great memories of your wife and be able to smile. Some days you’ll cry and be unable to keep going. It’s a back and forth process but this is how we people grieve and process the idea of loss.

Please seek a grief counselor. We’re worried for you and we are so so sorry about your loss. We can tell how deeply you loved your wife and we’re so sorry."
