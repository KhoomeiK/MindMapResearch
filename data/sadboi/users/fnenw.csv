EASportsUFC,fr3qf48,t1_fr0d8qs,1589863486.0,grappling with ai is easier than grappling with real players that know what theyre doing. its just that gnp is a lot less effective against ai because theyre so much better at arm trapping than most players
UFC3,fr3pm85,t1_fqy8x01,1589862904.0,hes not even complaining about spammers lol he jus bitching about people slipping all his strikes
EASportsUFC,fqsv8sd,t1_fqpajoq,1589620072.0,majority of people that use khabib up until div5 are scared of grappling
EASportsUFC,fqsuzro,t1_fqsmy2w,1589619804.0,"look around in your settings, probably something like “visuals”
it is one of the colourblind assist colours, i use it as well"

EASportsUFC,fqrqwuj,t1_fqrq880,1589589998.0,yeah i would say he isnt nearly as op in middleweight but he has easily the best boxing in welterweight + some of the best grappling. especially with the bjj
EASportsUFC,fqrokvi,t1_fqrhpxh,1589588599.0,idk if i would say nick diaz is low rated haha hes arguably the most overpowered fighter in WW
suicidebywords,fqqmalv,t1_fqqlos1,1589568009.0,no the fuck he should not have
EASportsUFC,fqozkmg,t3_gj3vce,1589529796.0,its based on damage. he must have attempted some subs on the ground in rd3. you had slightly less health at the end so he won the match
EASportsUFC,fqo8wp8,t1_fqk8uv1,1589510007.0,pinning jon jones players on their back and landing a lot of gnp with chael sonnen are some of my favourite moments on ranked
EASportsUFC,fqo50tl,t3_gjrvaj,1589507699.0,"when youre in that situation, fake the full guard transition, hit them, then transition. more likely to catch them off guard and avoid that stalemate

EASportsUFC,fqcrefn,t1_fq9lgxo,1589266463.0,"postured half guard is my favourite position for grappling. i only throw straight punches to the body, and i like to mix it up a lot when i throw to the head. mostly hammerfists and elbows though haha"
EASportsUFC,fqcr18j,t1_fqcgukv,1589266131.0,"that is probably the case haha
but it really gets on my nerves when people just lay and throw punches from closed guard for the whole fight. i like to think im a pretty good grappler and it bothers me when people dont attempt subs or try to posture up and do some damage"
UFC3,fpzbgua,t1_fpz5llx,1589016088.0,"agreed haha. i am a fan of striking with cain though! cain, severn, and lewis are the only heavyweights i use tbh"
wokekids,fpz9m9r,t1_fpyclmb,1589015353.0,"i dont understand the downvotes lol these people must think kids are a lot dumber than they really are. which is still pretty dumb, but thats not the point"
UFC3,fpy5esy,t1_fpxsl0n,1588996386.0,"appreciate it! but i use kamaru because im mostly a grappler, not many welterweights better than him for my style of play. and his boxing is nice, its just that he doesnt have many combos with kicks, and hes got a pretty basic moveset. i’ll have to go into quick play tonight and work on my mike perry game though haha"
UFC3,fpxjy3m,t1_fpvghtm,1588984013.0,have you got any tips for using mike perry? even when i stick to straight boxing i find my stamina drains really fast whenever i use him. one of the main reasons i stick to my boy kamaru in welterweight haha
UFC3,fpr60rt,t1_fpqyx8l,1588843676.0,"sprawl is difficult to get out of sometimes. to stand up to over under, you want to do your transition as their arm is coming up to hit you. you want to transition right before the peak of their strike as it comes down to hit you. if they deny that, take a few strikes then hold L2 + left or right on the right stick for a quick bottom half guard transition."
EASportsUFC,fpr5wdu,t1_fpr465q,1588843546.0,i use a lot of push kicks. jab into a body roundhouse is fairly quick too if youre trying to work their body. i usually just stick to throwing some lead body hooks into my combos for the most part
EASportsUFC,fpr47d4,t1_fpovpi5,1588841773.0,"83 power  in middleweight. thats one of his only downsides at 185 in this game imo, but he’s one of my favourite B rated fighters in the game tbh"
EASportsUFC,fpr44ao,t1_fpqbir6,1588841684.0,"its because he doesnt have muay thai combos. pretty much just boxing. if you stick to boxing and wrestling for the most part, hes lethal"
EASportsUFC,fpr3llu,t1_fpqb1hj,1588841156.0,"conor has like 88 bottom game at the most lol. he has some  underrated bjj, hes a brown belt under john kavanagh lol his ground stats are fine as they are imo"

UFC3,fpqzqlc,t1_fpot60d,1588837360.0,they would have to overhaul the clinch system for couture to be useful and accurate. cant have both with the way clinch strikes work at the moment imo

UFC3,fpqvbbr,t1_fpq7t78,1588833308.0,"im down some time, send me your username"
UFC3,fppwvi6,t1_fpnl1b3,1588810720.0,if i get an example of that i will either post it on this sub or dm it to you. slipping a strike into a td attempt works fine as long as you dont duck straight into an uppercut. its effective when it works but theres still risk involved. usually i only try that when they throw a lot of jab hook combos so i can slip the jab then shoot under the hooks
UFC3,fplzx2n,t1_fos1zs8,1588722736.0,i agree but yb is trash
UFC3,fplvioc,t1_fplubp5,1588720281.0,"slipping a strike or two before shooting for a takedown works just as well. usually slip to one side or the other, then shoot. 
edit: for example, slip their jab and shoot for a double and it will be much faster than a wide open double leg that you didnt set up for. if they happen to throw an uppercut, it likely will not work in your favour. most of my takedowns come from me sizing my opponent up with head movement, then shooting as soon as they make their move"
UFC3,fpltuuk,t3_ge0bwf,1588719364.0,takedowns are a lot more consistent if you land a strike before you shoot.
