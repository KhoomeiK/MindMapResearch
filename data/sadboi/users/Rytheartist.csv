BipolarReddit,fj29oig,t3_faxptx,1582938090.0,"I need to listen to the last part. I smoke weed a lot as I only recently discovered my bipolar and BPD and that had been the only thing to stop my frequent panic attacks. I'm taking my antidepressants now and they have added lamictal. After 10 plus years (I'm 24) and 19 different medications this combo had made me feel more normal than I have ever felt. I do still suffer with anxiety issues socially, but through DBT therapy I'm hoping to help that"
PanicAttack,fiqcqxp,t3_f95nd5,1582641297.0,"I was 19 when I had my first one. Woke at 3am and couldn't decide whether to go to the ER or work. Me being the anxious sun of a bitch I am I went to work. I also thought I was having a heart attack, which made my 30 min drive to work tough. I thoughtwell I have zero history of heart problems so I figured I was just being irrational. Co-workers thankfully knew exactly what had happened and helpe d me with the knowledge. Have gone to urgent care 2 times and we once for panic attacks since I was 19. Mostly because I had to leave work and my work at the time refused to believe me or allow to me to miss without a write up unless I had a doctor note. So my broke ass is not only missing work but paying 50 bucks to miss work. Don't worry dear. It gets better. Just have to learn your own coping and life needs to make it happen."
jimmyjohns,fiqc8h3,t1_fiq63uq,1582640935.0,I overslept on a Sunday. Like 8am when I got there overslept. Thankfully it's a slow day and I had super prepped the day before (ended up not hitting projections) so we got bread from another store just in case and didn't even end up needing it open wise. Opened on time but damn if.i don't set 5 alarms every morning
BPD4BPD,fim35x2,t1_fijfisy,1582516890.0,"Seriously though, not being able to deal with emotions and trying to add all the emotions that come with sex is too much. I thought I was asexual for a long time because I blocked off emotions quite a bit (or at least the good ones). Today I refer to myself as demisexual, because I have 0 interest in random sex and haven't ever had good sex with someone I don't share that intense emotion with. That emotion is flipping rare. The worst part for me was the other emotions of having someone around and just doing anything you can to keep them, even when you know it's not gonna last. The sex has always sucked but I would attribute it to being asexual because I didn't know any better. This while scenario is super super common I've read in BPD"

jimmyjohns,fi74qob,t3_f6j3v9,1582214260.0,We had 2 call offs Tuesday and did our entire days projections by 1230.... With 3 inshops a gm and 3 drivers. We are a mainly delivery store.

kia,fhf390f,t3_f2weed,1581535317.0,She was driving home in 4 Lanes of rush hour traffic at around 5pm and a semi didn't see her and merged into her vehicle. Her car was turning sideways toward the other Lanes (she was in the far right lane) and we believe her lane assist saved her and other lives. She went off into the ditch and ran into this tree at around 50 mph. The airbag deployed. She climbed through the passenger door as the driver door was not operable. She walked away almost completely unscathed. Seatbelt burn and bruises. I will thank KIA everyday for saving my twin sisters life. It stood up to a semi truck and a tree

Justbe careful. People aren't as trustworthy as you think. If you need a friend let me know. Probably not in your area but new friends even online can really help with a different perspective etc

relationship_advice,esd1f0h,t1_escy4iq,1561844504.0,I kid you not just got out of a relationship just like this. I wanted to fix it but you cannot. You cant make someone listen. You cant make someone stop abusing you. You can only leave. Be strong and get the fuck out now. Take it from someone who was engaged at 19 married at 20 and divorced at 21. I've been in many relationships like that before and know better now. But knowing better doesn't make it any easier. You still have to push past the feeling of oh I can fix this. Oh I can change him. Oh he is just stressed. No. How someone treats you when they are struggling is important. He is not treating you right OP. You are NOT happy. Dont trap yourself in that. YOU are worth more.
relationships,escwyjf,t3_c7492e,1561841110.0,Gonna be honest I'd say it was an overreaction personally but that's from my own values and perspectives . You arent allowed to control what she does or who she is or your being the reason she should leave you. But at the same time it is your right to discontinue a relationship because she isnt for you. If her ability to take risks you deem unnecessary is a turn off to your sensibilities that's understandable too. In that case making that move might be smart. I also dont know how long you dated or anything else so.. anyway hope this helps

confessions,erp8f1j,t1_erp6nfr,1561104804.0,I am. About two months ago I started dating my best friend from college and her bf. It's definitely a different dynamic but it's one i enjoy. Though in your case it would likely be more of a having a primary relationship with someone and then having a secondary relationship more short term. But the key is communication and being 100 percent open with everyone you date. It isnt for everyone and not everyone understands it either.

actuallesbians,erp3edg,t3_c36zrp,1561097972.0,As someone who is polyamorous and bisexual I understand her position. But I dont agree with her timing or her lack of fully communicating how important having a poly relationship was to her in your relationship as a couple. If you cant stomach poly that's totally understandably and you arent a bad person for it. It just might be while you love her and she loves you you might not be right for each other in your current place in life.
