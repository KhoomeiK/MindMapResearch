I have already mentioned gerrymandering and you can watch John Olivers video on it or look at maps that are changed to fit predominantly black latino asian areas because that is who they believe vote more blue. Voter suppression happened in my state of AZ in which they shut down booths in areas with a larger mexican base or how they only had one booth in a college campus in michigan because of the area's voting history. Black and latino people have an increased chance of being arrested for possession of marijuana than white people with a higher number of white people in the country who smoke marijuana. We can talk about racist cops but i dont know how I would feel about it if you defended most cops.
gifs,fo294jj,t1_fo28qma,1587453759.0,"Holy shit you will never get it will you. Personal beliefs are spread and become group beliefs.  If a group believes they hate a group,  lets say Italians,  you say that this is fine because they arent hurting them.  But the problem with this is the forming of these groups is specifically because of their freedom to do so.  When these groups become violent, you can say well yeah thats illegal (which it is) and realize they formed based off their freedom to do so.  This was literally how the KKK started with hate and they had the right to. But as soon as they grew because their beliefs were so easily spreadable, their second wave killed thousands of people and had influence on state laws to suppress black people and other races. This is hatred is always spread and it is by defending their right to hate"

Hatred of others and acting upon it by murdering them. Sure,  they arent massacring people,  but look at nazi germany, a place where the beginning of their cause was to scapegoat people and to prohibit other ideas.

The people in power and the supporters are doing so and spread false narratives that creates racial tension between people.  This should be illegal but of course it isnt. Waving the flag is giving power to it,  not me disliking the flag,  because it builds a movement even if you arent for the history behind a flag,  people are still growing a base of hatred for groups of people just like in Nazi Germany and it will continue to worsen. This presidency has worsened this issue and make people think it is okay to be racist,  homophobic, transphobic, xenophobic, etc.  He has not himself,  but backers are causing this.  To sit around and defend this type of hatred will only bring us to a world where it is too late. Do not believe me? Look at the people of germany who were not against the jewish people but did not oppose the radicalised groups calling for jewish and other minorities to be scapegoats. These were just words and symbols at one point that turned into a massive issue. And now we are living in a world where we defend these peoples uses of words and symbols to further push their propaganda naturally and now they become an issue like they are literally right now"

This is a straw man argument and the difference between the rainbow flag and confederate is that the flag is used as a white nationalist symbol,  the only reason it ever came back was against the CIVIL RIGHTS era,  and waving it ""for heritage"" is a lie to oneself considering this is the flag of a traitor. I never mentioned to cause violence, but these people that are waving these flags are literally walking around with guns at rallies to incite violence and use hate symbols against chinese people.  And to say it isnt is naive considering they could peacefully protest. But im sure youre fine with that first amendment right because it is their right to scare the masses.  Im sure youd be fine with things today we consider immoral back then because they were legal back then."

If you are fine with people waving nazi flags,  you aren't defending a principle considering that flag means the literal opposite of freedom of expression. It is a contradiction to this.  The alt right is the extremist right that use white nationalism and xenophobia to try to look like patriots.They follow Trump and republicans that, as i have alreayd mentioned,  gerrymander, suppress minorities,  and create laws against illegal immigrants. It is so hard to argue with you because you think waving a flag that incites hatred is fine becuase it is to piss off people? That is a weird reason to do something and I am done arguing with a person that pretends not to be something for the sake of an argument"
