dating_advice,fltf3af,t1_flteuwq,1585470137.0,"Yeah those are the basic 'stupid' lies everyone tells their partner. 

Have you talked to him about this? There's almost always a reason for someone giving up on sex. Might be something big he is going through in his life, maybe he's really confused about this whole sex thing. It could be anything really, and if he doesnt know why he suddenly stopped doing foreplay etc, then its probably something he doesnt want to tell, or something he doesnt know yet I guess."
dating_advice,flteqmi,t1_flte38o,1585469707.0,"For me , love and sex are 2 different things. Sex is just lust and it doesnt have anything to do with real love, so you dont have to feel guilty or whatever. If you are attracted to him then this attraction will be there no matter what. No toy or anything else can change that. If you two are happy and the only problem is your high sex drive then you two should try to experiment to find a way that works for both off you. 

And as a side note, almost any man thats new to sex will have a fragile, low self esteem. Its something that he has to build up from experience, and if the experiences arent helpful (finishing each other in 5mins) then he wont ever learn how to have good sex. Talk to him about the low self esteem and make him aware of it. Also tell him that he has nothing to worry about if he just works on it. Its something you do together, so he has to be there for you."
dating_advice,fltdyej,t3_fr2688,1585468780.0,"I think that he might be ashamed that he has a small penis I guess? Also, sex is quite difficult to talk about for some people. Its good that you 2 are communicating about it and you should definitely share your needs with him. If you told him everything thats in this reddit post then he should try to do something to get your needs fulfilled. You can always try toys or other stuff but some men feel less men when they cant do the job themselves and see toys or other things as a huge slap in the face and are offended really bad by it. If this is how he thinks about it, then its for you to comfort him and tell him that you're happy with him and that it doesnt matter. 

Sex is important and if you think that this wont work and he wont do anything about it, then you should considering talking to him about that you need certain things in a relationship and that he doesnt want to work on those things. And hope that confronting him with an option works, because otherwise he will lose you all together. I hope it helps, good luck."

On the introvert part, being introvert doesnt mean you do not like people around but it just takes a lot of energy for an introvert to have social interactions. Every nornal human being craves intimicy and thats normal, you shouldnt put pressure on finding a partner before a specific age or time because that will have you stressed out.

Most people who are single tell me that they would like a girlfriend. But that they are scared to date. They want to have a relationship but put 0 effort or energy into it. So, if someone puts 0 energy into looking for a relationship, then the chance of getting 1 is also close to 0%. But if you start dating and keep trying even though you get rejected or whatever then you're still in the market, so more chance to find someone."

This is when we see the most weird things because there's no filters and nothing makes sense. I dont know why those hallucinations are always evil monsters or scary things though. 

I would recommend you to read about sleep paralysis and its variants, because sleep paralysis is just not being able to move while dreaming but there's different things that can go wrong. If you think its neccessary then go see a therapist or a specialist."

Getting yourself to do something else will make a huge difference, because over time your 'addiction' towards the game will shrink. This takes time and discipline though.

If you cant resists playing the game when watching videos etc then i'd suggest unsubscribing on youtube and at least have some streamers that play other content if you dont have that already. 

If u wanna quit to game then you need to find what triggers you to play it. If its the league universe with streamers and lec etc then you need to see that watching them is okay but playing the game isnt. If that doesnt work for you then you should quit those things too."

What our onconscious brain doesnt know is that we live in social context where we aren't fighting every human to increase our chance of survival. It threats a verbal attack the same as a physical attack. For example; your boss thinks you're not doing your job well and tells you a bunch of things you're doing wrong. Your unconscious mind reads his body posture, facial expressions and picks up things like pheremones, the tone of a voice and your thoughts about the situation. If everything adds up then your unconscious brain can decide within a few milliseconds that this is a big threat and you will defend yourself in a way you do not control, your unconscious brain decides here for survival. 

This is called your fight, flight and freeze reaction and ur brain threats this 'boss' situation the same as a physical attack. Imagine you're out in this dense wilderness of bushes and leaves everywhere and you cant see very far ahead of you. You're hungry and looking for food and you are walking around and you push away some leaves and there is a tiger. Before you yourself could know what is happening with your conscious brain, which is that you're gonna be eaten by a tiger, your unconscious brain has already send a signal to your muscles to run for your fucking life. Disables all the systems in your body that you dont need, like reproduction (sex), or your hunger (digestion) and makes all these changes and sends all these signals in a few milliseconds.
