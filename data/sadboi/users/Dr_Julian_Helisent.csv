This guy's email is the tipping point for you even though it's between your business and him and not an issue with her work performance. Don't involve her in the email issue - she doesn't control what her abusive husband does.

It is very very possible that your son is agreeing to the adoption because it makes you happy. Also, this huge tragedy in your son's life has made your family whole? BARF. Get a hold of yourself. You're obviously looking at this through your own experiences with your ex. Make an appointment with a family attorney and see if you can get your husband guardianship of your kid.
