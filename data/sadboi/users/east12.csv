I think the number of teams partially depends on what kind of categories you have as well. If it's a points only league or a league without bangers cats, then I think 12 is a decent number.

But if they don't like its functionality, you should make it clear to them how much extra effort they (and you, especially) have to put in for manual rookie draft, minors bench and salary cap if you were to switch to Yahoo.
