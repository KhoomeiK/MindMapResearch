schizoaffective,f2zvnhb,t3_dew1pn,1570539841.0,I'm going to echo every one else about getting back on medication.  For me medication has been a god send. It helps me function not only in day to day life but also at work.
schizoaffective,f2zunf5,t3_denliq,1570538994.0,"I'm on Geodon only. So far it works very well for me. No symptoms of psychosis and no mood episodes. Before that I was on Zyprexa which worked just as well, but I had to be taken off if because of weight gain."
Buddhism,f2ggmi1,t1_f2fvdfd,1570230348.0,I'll have to check them out. Thank you
Buddhism,f2fn12t,t1_f2eyr9b,1570220018.0,"Thank you for the link.  I've read it twice so far, and I am sure that I will reread it again.  Again thank you."
schizoaffective,f2eji78,t3_dbzpnl,1570197002.0,I remember those socks. lol
schizoaffective,f2b5v0t,t3_dcmau2,1570122186.0,"Don't let the statistics scare you.  I work part time right now but that is because our finances were fine and it helped with child care.  I am fully capable of working full time and have worked full time jobs in the past.  Actually I will switching to full time sometime in the future once a position comes open.  Relationship wise, yes mine has gone to shit but not all of that is to blame on my illness. I have strong social ties with friends and family.   I function very  well in both life and work. i am able to take care of my child like any other parent and be there for him. I am able to keep up with daily demands of life.   Another example for you, my best friend has been married to a medicated Schizophrenic for the past 18 years, he holds down a full time job and they have three children.  To talk to him and hang around him you would never know that he has Schizophrenia."
news,eyxtuck,t3_cz9quq,1567562384.0,I'm just waiting for Polio to make a come back.
schizoaffective,eywcomd,t3_cxtzem,1567526377.0,"Yes.  It ramps up when I am home alone.  I'll get a chill go down my spine and it feels like someone is standing right behind me watching my every move,"
schizoaffective,eywbzpc,t3_cyisfg,1567525907.0,"First symptom was a massive depression that resulted in a suicide attempt at 14. Then at 15 I had my first mania. While this was going on I had delusions but no one knew because I didn't talk about them. I think the delusions and paranoia started around 14/15.  I would go a further two decades believing that I was Bipolar 1 with psychotic features before finally coming open about the delusions and paranoia  and getting the Schizoaffective diagnoses. I always figured that my delusions and paranoia  were part of the Bipolar, never gave it much thought that I had them outside mood episodes. I only came open because I was given an antipsychotic to control the Bipolar symptoms and all my delusions and paranoia went away.

So in short first diagnosed with depression at 14. Then Bipolar at 15, switched to Bipolar 1 with psychotic features at 17 and was 36 when diagnosed with Schizoaffective Bipolar subtype."
insanepeoplefacebook,ewgyzwi,t3_co12ae,1565393743.0,I wish I could just will myself to be mentally healthy. Would save me from having to take antipsychotics every day.
schizoaffective,evihre0,t1_evdwirm,1564542859.0,"No, our son is 13 years old.  I've been hanging on the best that I can."
schizoaffective,evclg0f,t3_cj97z3,1564417866.0,Take a deep breath and tell yourself that everything will be fine. I know that that is easier said than done but at least try.  Do you have people you can trust that you can talk to?
Infidelity,eulep3z,t3_cdrr2h,1563900379.0,I consider it to be the same.  The hurt was just as bad as if it had been physical.  The amount of secrets and lying that were involved actually made me think he was having sexual encounters.
ShitMomGroupsSay,etqusw0,t3_ccl449,1563103114.0,"Ok this is just creepy. Who the hell would do this?  I can understand the pendants that hold ashes, but this is just nasty."
schizoaffective,etqulf8,t3_ccjg0i,1563102865.0,I absolutely love this post.  So true.
schizoaffective,etqt6fp,t3_ccu551,1563101161.0,In the past I used to and I suffered because of it.  My current Psych Dr is pretty upfront about telling him if the meds are not working or if the side effects are too bad.  Said it's no problem to tweak a med or change it.  Because of this we have been able to try a few different ones until we found one that worked that didn't cause side effects I couldn't handle.
schizoaffective,etqsvpz,t1_etminqa,1563100817.0,I work in a Nursing Home in the Laundry/Housekeeping department. It's pretty stress free and interacting the residents puts a smile on my face.  So much to learn from them about life.
schizoaffective,etftv6v,t3_cb9o5q,1562777487.0,Yeah my Dr said diagnoses are for insurance reasons and that you treat the symptoms not the diagnosis.
schizoaffective,etfqlrh,t1_etfe5dd,1562775538.0,"yes I do. Have been non stop chatting with friends either through text,facebook, or on the phone.  All my friends live out of the area but my family is real close by (like right now the street)"
schizoaffective,etfaoqd,t3_cafjgr,1562765069.0,I had some trouble in the past.  Then I found a job that I actually love and have been there coming up on 13 years.
schizoaffective,etf794v,t1_etederu,1562762307.0,I have friends and family here for me.  They all know about the situation.  And I have a therapy appointment tomorrow.
schizoaffective,etf6rmq,t1_etep2h5,1562761886.0,I have a therapy appointment tomorrow.  Should be an interesting appointment.  I was totally blindsided by all this so my therapist should be shocked too.
schizoaffective,etf6knb,t1_etegexm,1562761716.0,"LOL  this did make smile,  thank you."
schizoaffective,etdasvy,t1_etcpe4s,1562702846.0,"Not much alone time, he glued to his cell phone and constantly on it."
schizoaffective,errnegb,t3_c2armu,1561176122.0,"I lead a semi normal life here.  Long term relationship, job, raising a child, pursue hobbies, etc.  I might not have a lot of friends but ones that I do have I am very close with. None of this came easy for me. It was a uphill battle and while I may not have the job I planned on  I do like my job and and make okay money."
schizoaffective,errmqc6,t1_erl123p,1561175476.0,Wacky beliefs was my norm before medication.   Sometimes I look back and think WTF
