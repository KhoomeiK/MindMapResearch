But in a relationship, it’s a no go for me.... like makes me feel physically grossed out and totally turned off. I know not everyone feels that way and that’s totally fine, so I am super upfront early in a relationship about the fact that it’s not cool with me. I have a very high sex drive, so it would be a major affront to know i was ignored in favor of someone else. Based on how I feel about sex, it would be an instant turn off, just wouldn’t work for me.

I think a lot of women don’t care, some of whom don’t want sex that much so it works out. Some like porn too. A lot of other women don’t want anything to do with it, but go along with their partners because they feel like they have no choice. It’s ok to feel however you feel about it, just be open with your partner. Hopefully it will bring you closer together."

Being physically fit and healthy, practicing self care, it all makes me feel so much better just because it’s taking my mind off all the negative things in my head and putting a positive focus on my actual physical being. Like I can shift my mental focus of evaluating myself to these positive actions and my abilities. I can tell myself, ok, I might not be capable in this emotional aspect (yet), but I can run fast, I mastered a new yoga pose, I ate a delicious healthy meal, I took care of my skin/hair/nails, took all my meds and vitamins. It helps me to feel better about myself, serves as a distraction, and provides me with a positive physical foundation to build upon and try matching my mind to that.

Eventually she was like ok well then you need to find someone who is completely stable, happy and normal. (And only one person at a time...) I was like huh those people exist?? And how I would I relate to them!? But I was afraid I was going to get kicked out of the program for some of my behavior so I was like ok I’ll try it. lo and behold I found my husband who I’ve now been with for almost 6 years! I refused to pretend or hide who I was or what my issues were. I was 1000% upfront with him from the get go. Like oh that alarm on my phone well it’s time to take my psychiatric medication, those scars are from self harm, etc. I never hid my crazy from him. And because he *wasnt* crazy, he never played into my bullshit or got sucked into the drama I attempted to create. He was patient and supportive, but with no savior complex. He held me to a higher standard, but also didn’t guilt me if I failed. To this day he helps me and manages my behavior with patience and a sense of humor. And given that for me I tend to reflect and rely heavily on my FP for my own self image and stability, it works out much better when my FP is emotionally and mentally rock solid and generally very positive.

People who have valuable insight (like you, maybe) can hopefully comment on those posts and help others to see understand those layers to the FP phenomenon in their lives.

Plus, the fact that people talk about it as if it can’t be changed is pretty much just par for the course with bpd, at least for me anyway, however I feel in a given moment, it often seems like that feeling will go on forever.

Whether or not minor feelings of disappointment might be valid and justified on some level, she should also be able to appreciate your feelings —and what I think many, many women would agree was a sweet, heartfelt proposal. This is about the decision to get *married* for goodness sakes, not a promposal or a performance.

Also we don’t know anything about their relationship so to say he abandoned her is a little over the top. 

The comparison was to demonstrate that people can change as can their opinion of whether or not they are ready for parenthood

ETA: I’ve had 2 unplanned pregnancies myself. I kept them both, and while their fathers did decide to parent, one far less enthusiastically than the other, that was their decision, not mine. Men shouldn’t be on the hook for child support, birth support, or as you said buying clothes, food, necessities, etc., just because they had sex — unless they choose to parent that child. Just like women shouldn’t be forced to keep or abort a pregnancy or a baby just because the father (or anyone else) wants them to. Both parties should get a choice. I wouldn’t want someone else to force my reproductive/parenting choices and thus I respect the autonomy of men to make those choices themselves too."
relationships,fnfqglg,t3_g1gj2a,1586913330.0,"I know this isn’t the point but there’s no such thing as “personally pro life.” You’re pro choice. You don’t believe the government should have a say in the decisions made between a woman and her physician. That’s the definition of pro choice. 

I want to underline this point because the idea that pro-choicers are cool and casual about abortion and would do it with no qualms needs to go the fuck away. You *are* pro-choice. You can still be pro choice and personally bothered by the fact that your husband wanted this teenager to get an abortion — because it should always be and ultimately was *her* choice what to do with her own body. 

For the record I don’t think there’s anything wrong with him choosing to not be involved with his child from 20 years ago and later deciding to become a parent with you. He just didn’t want to be a father then/with her. Just like how women can give a baby up for adoption when they weren’t ready and eventually decide to become mothers down the line. I do think it’s completely messed up that he lied to you this entire time. What else could he be keeping secret??? That part would have me extremely worried."

Speaking from direct experience. When you confront him make sure you don’t give on that you know who jt was with, just tell him firmly that you know he was unfaithful and he needs to confess.

The thing is since he isn’t the one who decided to come clean, and he’s just carrying on with no intention to tell you, this likely wasn’t a one time thing.

I know this is such a difficult time. I’m so sorry for what you’re going through. Consider it a blessing that you are finding this out now instead of having a marriage or kids to worry about.

I didn’t find out the whole truth until after the baby was born, which included him cheating on me many many times pretty much every opportunity he got over 5 years, but I knew something was up during pregnancy. When everything came out in the open and we filed for divorce, he ran off with someone else, I was on my own with my brand new baby and didn’t hear from him for months. While I was sad for my son to be missing out on having his father around, I had this incredible gift, my very own baby, to help me to realize my own independence and create a new life for myself. I really didn’t have time or energy or even room in my heart for sadness over someone who was clearly such a piece of shit; and I had more important things to worry about — the challenge of becoming a new mom, healing from birth, and raising an infant — all of which was new and exciting. This isn’t just the birth of your baby. It sounds cheesy, but this is YOUR rebirth into the new you who is SO fucking done with his shit. Please enjoy this time with your baby. Bask in the love of this life you’ve created. Don’t give him room in your head or your heart to ruin this for you; you might feel vulnerable in your position, I definitely did, but you can learn to wear it like armor. 

My advice for the nitty gritty: Don’t make any plans that include him, wait until you’re ready once the baby’s here and you have seen what kind of father he’s going to be. While you’re nesting make sure you have a safe, comfortable place set up with family/friends to help you right after birth. You will want help! Focus on YOU. Also— Consult legal help if you need to after the baby’s born. Only include your ex in the labor/birth if you wish and you think it will be positive for you, but don’t make any additional parenting decisions with him until you’re actually dealing with the baby. My guess is a guy who’s seeing prostitutes while his wife is pregnant isn’t going to be the most helpful during the newborn phase. Trust me it’s his loss. Focus on you and baby and soak up all the adorable baby love!!!"

Parenting,fiw9rxp,t3_fa3dm4,1582778877.0,"Is there anyone you can go stay with to help you with the new baby? I’ve had 3, and I feel like the number one thing I needed those early days was sleep. You need to rest and recover. If your parents or friends or anyone in your support system can either take you in for a few day or come and stay so you can get a few decent chunks of sleep, I bet you’ll be able to process all of this much better. My biggest concern when reading this is that you have the support and help you need to heal and care for your little one. 

In terms of your husband, I can imagine you are incredibly disappointed with him. All I kept thinking when reading that was that he must be scared or selfish. Maybe he just still  needs some time to adjust, I’m hoping for your sake he snaps the fuck out of this, but I am horrified by his behavior on your behalf. 

Please take care of yourself! No woman should be without support in this time. I wish you and your boys the very best."

relationships,fiqfvpr,t1_fiq95w3,1582643404.0,This is such an important point. We can’t take for granted that there are plenty of people who don’t even understand that women and children don’t have to legally take the husbands last name.
relationships,fiqficj,t3_f94nsf,1582643164.0,"I sympathize with your internal struggle and it seems like you’re being very thoughtful about it based on your edit, and really it’s just a shitty situation to be in where rarely is everyone (ie the woman) happy. I say this out of my own frustration with this last name crap personally as well as just for basically all the women I know and read about dealing with this and so many other bullshit, gendered expectations: I’m sick of men feeling entitled to even our NAMES for fucks sake. Add it to the list along with our bodies, our time, our smiles, etc. 

I don’t blame my husband for wanting and expecting me to take his name. It’s so deeply culturally imbedded, I remember talking to some male colleagues who said it would be a *dealbreaker* if their wife wanted to keep her OWN NAME, and plenty of people who thought children and wives are legally required to take the husbands name! WTF. it’s the sort of thing that signals masculinity in a clear, direct way because it almost never goes the other way that men take the woman’s name. It’s super easy for them since it’s not their sacrifice but also something straight men have always taken for granted— thinking about their own moms and teachers and all the women they’ve known throughout our cultural history. I feel like all I can do now is try to make sure my sons don’t grow up feeling so entitled down the line."
relationships,fi8xoab,t3_f6yqti,1582250758.0,"It looks like the writings on the wall here, and 99% of the time this means infidelity has occurred. Especially with 2 stds. WOW. and I’m so sorry you’re going through this. But just have to check: do you have any symptoms? Is that why you went in to the doctor? I ask because at the beginning of my previous pregnancy I had a positive in-office trichinomiasis test out of nowhere and freaked out when they told me it’s treatable but only sexually transmitted. My husband was dumbfounded and swore he hadn’t done anything sexual with anyone else in years— he wasn’t even all that defensive, never gaslighted me, just was concerned and confused. I also had NO symptoms whatsoever. She checked it again and said to her it looked positive but her in-office diagnostics aren’t always 100% so she sent it out to a lab to get tested. NEGATIVE. Not even a trace for the full std panel. Then she explained that sometimes sperm cells get confused with trich cells... odd, and thanks for freaking me out for nothing, but I was just relieved. Idk how that could have happened in your case — maybe a lab mixup? — but I don’t think it’s pointless to get retested. This will likely have a very significant impact on your life, so you want to be sure. 

Also, if you confirm std diagnosis (or have obvious symptoms) I highly recommend you wait at least a few days before you confront him to get your wits about you and speak with a lawyer just so you don’t get blindsided by the grief when you speak to him. I’m so sorry you’re going through this, and I wish you the best."

survivinginfidelity,fhi6sdt,t3_f37i64,1581618823.0,"Wow this was kind of hard to read. Your pain is palpable and I’m so sorry for what you’ve been through. I went through a somewhat similar situation, the AP was his engaged coworker who he said I would be great friends with, although I was actually pregnant at the time. Almost 7 years out from divorce now, and I can’t deny that it messed me up a bit; although I don’t feel pain about the events of what happened, I still doubt myself because I felt so sure and was so very wrong about someone I had spent my entire adult life with. I trust my now husband of five years, but I don’t trust my own judgment so I question everything and I don’t think I would ever take “forever” for granted again. However, I feel so sad that you have this sense of longing for *him* and I think maybe you haven’t fully regained your sense of self yet. Because I had a one month old baby to take care of when AP called off her wedding and my ex ran off with her, I very quickly began my own journey to who I was and I also had my priorities crystal clear. I recommend trying to set up your own goals and think about who you are and who you have been without centering the past decade mentally around your ex. 

Also, my ex is still with his AP, married with a child. Just like you mentioned I too had everyone comforting me with the obvious “you’re prettier, smarter, and cooler than she is” but I know that makes it even more confusing. I started to question myself, amplify my flaws... because if I’m prettier, smarter, and cooler and he still chose her, well then I must have some major negatives that he wasn’t willing to overlook. Then I started dating — which was very new for me since my ex had been my first serious relationship at 19 — and I realized immediately that we simply weren’t right for each other, and that we just didn’t have as much in common as I thought. Maybe your current boyfriend isn’t the “one” but your differences with your ex are vast. Just because you had your future kids name picked out (which I had to realize myself isnt an indicator of commitment) doesn’t mean you actually had the same values, priorities, and lifestyle preferences. Obviously he is VERY different from you in that respect, he just found his right person sooner than you did. Your right person will ultimately be so so so much better for you that you will forget all about the pain and wonder why you ever wasted that energy on someone who was so wrong for you. At least, I know that’s possible. 

Final thought since you mentioned fantasizing about revenge. I totally get it, but one of the most satisfying things you might realize is that your revenge is already happening without you doing a single thing. YOU will undoubtedly hang over HER head for years. Maybe even the rest of her life. Clearly you and your ex did have fond feelings and happy times. He was so committed to you he led her along for years, even let her marry someone else. He wasn’t right for you, but he did love you. And she not only knows it, she had to see it, fight against it, wonder how long it would go on for. She will always compare herself to you and recall painfully how long she had to share so much of him with you. You saw just how much disdain she had for you when you met, and although she got to keep him, she will always deal with the memories of you two together that she saw with her own two eyes for a long time. Plus, he’s clearly no prize and not someone you would want to marry anyway, and the dark cloud of the affair and lies and shadows will always loom over their marriage. They know exactly what each other is capable of and sowed those seeds of doubt before they ever got to build a foundation. I know I couldn’t live like that, and now you don’t have to. Free yourself of her and him, free your mind and heart and appreciate the lessons you learned along the way. Living well is the best revenge. Never look back."

Plenty of women get zero Pto, particularly in low-wage jobs or those simply stringing together multiple part time jobs. 25% of American women return to work after just 10 days off.

My 6 year old son does it still too; I was told that it’s genetic and not uncommon. He sleeps like a rock and even when I try to wake him up to go pee in the middle of the night, it’s rare that he will wake up enough to figure out he needs to pee."

BPD,fgzfub2,t3_f0uz4z,1581193810.0,"I have always connected to Alice in wonderland - since I was a kid I didn’t feel like a princess but rather like a little girl tumbling down the rabbit hole, living in nonsense, chasing after something for no reason but always chasing, never knowing who to trust, but always thriving in my imagination— and I agree: I felt that same connection to frozen you do, though I didn’t connect it to a borderline thing. I thought it was just me. Frozen 2 has some very strong parallels to my internal experience as well. Have you seen it? I think it’s more about a personal connection and of course won’t be the right fit for each and every borderline, but now that you point it out, I’m not surprised others feel like I do about it."

Marriage,ffwuhkz,t1_ffvxlx4,1580311284.0,"I see why it’s necessarily true that a break is absolutely a break up. She might not be ready for counseling. This was only 4 months ago and they’ve only been married for a year. All she’s asking for is some space/time to wrap her mind around this betrayal. I think OP needs to simply be patient and understanding at this point. Don’t push her, coerce her, or draw any firm lines, but rather ask her to go to counseling with you and assure her you’re ready when she is. 

So you began this emotional affair less than a year into your marriage? She very well might never get over this. I think if you care about her, the best thing would be to listen to her when she tells you what she wants."
Marriage,ffwt9n9,t1_ffwd4zo,1580310478.0,"Agree. This list has nothing to do with him as a person, it’s just little nagging things. Her brain is probably constantly in mom-mode.

Marriage,fdmvq6h,t1_fdmstsy,1578568043.0,"Please don’t bury your head in the sand about this. He will just keep doing it so long as he can get away with it. It sounds like he knows you aren’t going anywhere, even if you wanted to. Make an effort to get a job; your daughter will be starting school soon anyway. Maybe look into work-from-home customer service or sales jobs. This will allow you to gain some confidence in yourself and some independence as well as maybe make him realize he can’t continue to take you for granted. Also I highly recommend you take some time away from him just temporarily. If there are any family members you can stay with for just even a few nights (don’t tell him how long you’ll be gone) it would be helpful, and tell him you need some space and don’t talk to him during that time. This will allow you some space to think clearly and him some time to realize what he’s fucking up. There’s also the option of making him leave for a while — I know you share the house idk how that would go over but the point is you need to put some distance between him and you to gain some self worth."
BPD,fdm8ygb,t1_fdm8e0r,1578542762.0,"Have you heard of 50 shades of grey? I feel like all that rough sex stuff actually got super popular a few years ago, even middle-aged vanilla soccer moms were going crazy over it. Probably different for you because obviously it’s more deep seated, but it doesn’t mean you are fucked up, you are just kinky. Your husband and you are likely just mismatched. 

The cheating thing you definitely need to get under control though. This is a problem; having sexual kinks isn’t one."
BPD,fdm81bi,t3_em2yjr,1578542088.0,"I’m also 31, hyper sexual, and definitely have had some of those same interests... why do you feel like you need to deny yourself though? I don’t think thinking about sex or having high libido if something you should feel guilty about. Plus having fantasies and wanting roughness is actually not all that uncommon. Doesn’t mean that it’s not trauma related if that’s an issue for you, but lots of people like rough sex who have no traumatic pasts. Regardless it’s ok to want what you want. That doesn’t have to mean you are bad/dark/damaged. 

I was diagnosed over a decade ago, so maybe I’m just further along in the process of accepting some of these things about myself, but I don’t think anyone should be shamed for their high (or low) sex drive or their sexual preferences/fantasies so long as they are respectful of others and not making unreasonable demands of their partner. It sounds like you are being so hard on yourself! It might help to explore the issue of shame re: sex with your therapist. I wish you the best."
