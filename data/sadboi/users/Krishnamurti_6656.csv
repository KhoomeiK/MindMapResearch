All I can say is that you aren't alone. Though I wasn't in the same environment, I experience things almost the same as you do. Tbh, I thought I was broken, but soon realised it was the world, not me.

Do you ever just wonder about existence, in general and the existence (experience) of others?

If you want to talk, I would be more than happy to listen 🙏🏽"
socialskills,f2keafv,t3_ddnf7h,1570284407.0,"Firstly. Don't let other perceptions of your ""looks"" determine how you feel about yourself. It's all fucked. Ppl think we all start life in some sort of RPG character creator and we have control.over how we look. It's all utter bullshit.

You're not alone, friend. Live YOUR life, by YOUR values. Fuck what other people think, honestly.

You are loved, regardless ♥️"

Maybe give it more time?

Do they intend on helping us? I believe, as a species, we've completely lost the plot, somewhere along the way.
