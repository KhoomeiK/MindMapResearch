It wasn't the first time he had tried to use his mental health to manipulate me, he knows how much I care about mental health (I have my own mental health issues too). It was hard for me to tell if he was even struggling or if it was just to get me to talk to him. I ended up cracking and blocked him on everything.

If someone is not accepting of you for who you are, they aren't your friend. My mum also knows but I am so lucky to have her because she loves me no matter what. They are the only people I have told though since I keep it on a need to know basis.

I don't go into explanations and specifics unless it's someone like my mum, she still doesn't understand all the terms and the whole spectrum of asexuality/aromanticism but she's getting there.
