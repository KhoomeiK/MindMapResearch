Someone who’s experienced will need to comment on that. There’s plenty of comedy in broward and palm beach counties though. I’d check out places in Delray Beach to live closer to Boca and have walkable bars. The furtherest South to consider imo is Fort Lauderdale which will be more central to both your job and Miami. Either way you may have to up your budget or get a roommate. Check out the forums on city-data.com. They’re a great resource as well. Best of luck and pack your sunscreen!
