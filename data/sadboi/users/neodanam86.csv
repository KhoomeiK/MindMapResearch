He's not wired to think holidays are special, because like me they were never made special for him either, he just went in the opposite direction and made them meaningless instead of meaningful.

I appreciate your feedback, over the years I feel like I have tried to be as rational as I could be despite my times of uncontrollable emotional breakdowns and irrationality. I want to make my life better and have my son grow up in as healthy of an environment as possible. He seems like a happy baby for the most part so I try to give myself a pat on the back if I can manage it. 

During the quarantine I've taken (baby) steps to making things better and feel I'm going in the right direction. I don't, however, want to feel like I need to apologize for having certain expectations of the people in my life, and I definitely do NOT feel bad for enjoying the feeling of making others happy!"

ghibli,fpxwp5g,t3_gg3e3v,1588991124.0,"I always felt so frustrated with Seita for his choices. If he had just swallowed his pride and stayed with the Aunt he could have made it through the war. 

I thought Seita probably was spoiled and used to getting whatever he wanted because his parents were well off. At first he really imagined it was as simple as going to the shop and buying more food or that he was somehow entitled to things because he never had wanted for anything before in his life. He also seems slow to realize that it's just not going to happen the way he believes it should.


You kind of have to sympathize with him a little though because of how young he is. He wasn't mature enough to understand that money wasn't going to help during the situation they found themselves in. Still you can't help but be disappointed by the path he decides to take. Especially because of the aftermath. I also blamed the Aunt a bit, because she was the adult and knew better than that. It was war time though so I imagine it was a huge weight lifted off her shoulders and she decided to not question it. Out of sight out of mind. Likely she never found out what happened to them."

There hasn't been one day that has gone by that her mom hasn't broken down emotionally. People constantly post on her fb wall how much they miss her. Even I, someone who barely knew her, cries for her sometimes and for her mother. 


I'm sure she felt some absolutely unbearable feelings, but unfortunately she also caused those feelings to manifest in her friends and family by leaving.

I realize he is very young but my son is a very happy kid and I plan to do everything in my power to keep it that way. I can't be a perfect mom, but no one can..."
BPD,fo56idt,t3_g5ow8f,1587518572.0,"I find it annoying that some people on threads like this seem to mimic the sentiments of the person that made you so upset in the first place, like, if you are on a thread about bpd at least understand what that means.

I imagine it's a spectrum and some people do have worse reactions than others. I also understand that people do not have bad intentions when saying these things, but! Please understand that part of having bpd is being extremely sensitive and being overwhelmed by your emotions. When someone you love says, ""just let it go and be happy"" to a person with bpd it basically means ""I'm invalidating your feelings, they dont matter."" Of course this is not what the person said or meant but it is what the person with bpd heard because they are conditioned to feel that way.

So for me, someone with bpd, I say to OP - It's perfectly valid to feel those feelings. Your friend genuinely wanted to help you feel better but she doesn't understand how much pain you are in. As people with bpd we also have to understand that people can't just understand what we feel, we have to explain. I would say to your friend that because your brain is wired differently when you say things like that I feel like you don't take my sadness seriously. I appreciate that you are trying to help me, but I would feel better if you would just tell me that it's ok to feel the way I feel and to help me feel better. 

There are plenty of things someone without bpd can do to make someone with bpd feel better. Things that don't include ""rubbing in"" how much trouble you are having being normal. I really recommend a book called ""Loving someone with borderline personality disorder"" by Shari Y. Manning. She outlines ways to validate and things to do to make emotions less intense and less painful. I had my SO read it and it even helped ME to read it because it helped me to feel not quite so broken. It helped me feel like there is help and hope for people who live with this disorder. My SO definitely needs to work on it but it's definitely a step in the right direction.

Again OP its natural that you would feel how you're feeling about the interaction. Maybe wait until you are feeling a little better emotionally and then follow up with her about how you felt. Being appreciative but explaining how it hurt will be good for you and if this person is your friend they will try to understand.

I hope things go better for you in the future."

Definitely understand that feeling of loving someone so deeply. I love my boyfriend so much, I cry sometimes thinking about how much. I would do anything for him. He sets my heart on fire. While I know that in his heart he truly loves me, I know he will never love me on the level that I love him and it hurts.

I desperately want people to listen to what I have to say and interact with me, but it's like no one wants to.

I always have these grand ideas and plans but when it comes to executing any project that is worthwhile to me really - I fall short mostly and have all of my life. Now I have both depression and a 1 yr old so it's even harder to get things done! BUT! The thing that has helped me get a few things done is just forcing it. Forcing myself over that hump of - ""I'll just do it when I feel better."" Also telling myself how good I'll feel once I can just bask in the glow of my work. And I have! I felt like I really took some steps and that in turn helped with the constant negativity I usually feel towards myself. Of course there are days that I can't ""force it"" (today for instance) and I have to tell myself that that's ok as long as I push myself again. Also even baby steps - even doing one thing on your to do list - is an accomplishment so dont be too hard on yourself! Easier said than done I know!

I realize you are busy but maybe, just to give her a little relief, you could at least answer back that you are busy and you will text/call later. She isn't really saying anything that's scarring like many of the parents I've seen on other posts. I genuinely think she isn't purposely trying to make your life miserable, she just doesn't know how to handle you being away from her. I would argue she clearly loves you a lot and is just really desperate to know things are ok. Unfortunately I have first hand experience with these feelings which I work on in therapy.

trashy,f9bd3uq,t1_f9azpul,1575211470.0,"I worked at Macy's about 8 years ago in the juniors department. There was, at least at that time, a standard 20% off coupon that all card holders recieved in the mail. Now departments that recieved commissions for sales, such as shoes, would scan a store copy of this coupon for customers in order to increase their sales. This practice was absolutely frowned upon by management and employees would often get in trouble for doing it (not in the commission driven departments, just the rest of us minimum wage grunts).


Now it wasn't black Friday, maybe a sale day or just a normal day and a lady comes up to the juniors register to buy something. I ring up her items and give her the total, she snaps at me that she JUST used a coupon in shoes and I should scan one for her. Now for one thing I dont have a coupon, for another thing I'm not allowed to scan a coupon, and for another thing this woman is being rude as hell. I say to her, ""I'm sorry, I don't have a coupon. Would you still like the items?"" She starts getting irate and again argues that they just scanned a coupon in shoes. I calmly say to her again that I don't have the coupon  here in my department, she is welcome to walk back to shoes and get the coupon or check out there if she prefers. She scoffs at me like I'm disgusting and yells at me again, and again I calmly gave her her options. Finally after going on like that for a bit she snatches her things and storms over to shoes. Now, I thought that was the end of it, and I excuse myself to another employee to go to the restroom and take a moment to compose myself.
When I come back my co-worker says to me, ""OMG, I'm so glad you walked away, that woman came back! She said she was going to beat the sh*t out of you!!""


I was absolutely floored. A middle aged woman, obviously well off money wise, was going to come back to fight a 20 something minimum wage store clerk over a f*cking 20% off coupon!!!!???


Retail made me absolutely loathe the human race at times. I wish I could say this was the only experience I had like this but in the time I worked there and in previous retail locations I saw almost everything disgusting facet of the human race imaginable. People are hateful and unapologetic. More than likely the people who left this mess feel 100% justified. It's an employees job to clean it up, not theirs."

Parenting,f95m8va,t3_e3c1g8,1575130873.0,"What initially worked for me was using the Merlin sleep suit. Before I got that my son maybe slept 20 minutes at a time and I was going absolutely crazy. It was a GODSEND from maybe 4 months until around 6 when he began rolling over. He slept so well. I guess because he couldn't move and wake himself or startle himself. He just lay quietly and comfy on his back. He was in the bassinet near my bed for that time and he woke once or twice a night. Of course after that we couldn't use the sleep suit anymore because it was a suffocation hazard after the rolling over. 
After that it was a nightmare getting him to sleep again for about a week, we got a weighted sleep sack...which did nothing to keep him asleep. I began to think I would never sleep again. Finally we got the Zipadee-zee as an alternative and that worked like a charm. He is almost 9 months now and usually only wakes up once a night. 
Probably not the best method but it worked for me. We still have sleep issues but I'm learning to troubleshoot as time goes by. 
Hope this helps a little...?

Parenting,f95k3wn,t3_e3tpa3,1575129488.0,"I've definitely been the same way, and still am. I never completely relax, and many times when I'm at work I'm having anxiety attacks wondering if things are ok at home. He has a much lighter attitude towards keeping a hawk eye on our son and often is exhausted from work on his ""shift"" with the baby. I have been told many times that I ""make up"" issues that don't exist.
At a certain point though I had to step back and trust him. As a mother I think we tend to just say, if I want it done right I have to do it myself. But unfortunately we are only human and we have to step back and allow others to help for our sanity and physical health. I still check  them from time to time when I'm home, or text when I'm at work, but in my head I say to myself. SO loves the baby just as much as I do, he will do what is right to keep him safe, I need to step back and breathe and believe that things will be ok.
Chances are hubby already knows how you feel, but I would calmly state your case again and gently urge him to be a bit more vigilant. If you see things that don't sit right with you mention them in a calm and clear manner and explain why they bother you. After that there's nothing more you can really do. You can't be everywhere at once or control what's going to happen.

Parenting,f80pryi,t3_dyb3za,1574135007.0,I used a pack'n'play for the first 5 months with the bassinet attachment. I am an absolute nutbag when it comes to making sure my son is safe so that says something I think. I was at ease sleeping him in there until he started rolling. He was 6 months at that point anyway so we moved him to the crib in the next room with a breathe through mattress.

IdiotsInCars,f80mo07,t1_f80kxwf,1574132734.0,"Exactly, as a parent I am absolutely floored that anyone would say such a thing.
This child being unprotected in the car gives me a sour stomach and brings tears to my eyes. If I have my child with me, I have his car seat, end of story... If there is an emergency and I need to get somewhere there is no way he is not going to be protected. What if this had been more serious?
My boyfriend's aunt was in the car with her two young children about 10 years ago and was in a head on collision, they needed the jaws of life to get her out of the car and it was questionable that she would ever walk again, but her children were in carseats and guess what? They were absolutely fine and protected. Can you imagine what would have happened if they weren't? 
This thought alone should be enough to keep your child in the correct safety apparatus for their age and size, no matter what. Maybe you don't mind losing your child, but I absolutely do.
We have used our carseat in Uber/Lyft cars  multiple times. No excuse when your child's safety is involved."

I'm sorry but I don't really have any kind of sympathy for you. I don't see your wife doing anything wrong here, you knew who she was when you married her and she has reconciled the fact that you will never have the same sex drive as she does. Can't you try to do the same for her? If you love her like you say you do?"

Seems like your current situation is far better and non-bio dad is bonded with him. As long as he is getting the emotional support he needs from you guys I really don't think you need to muck up feelings that he may or may not be able to process at this age.
