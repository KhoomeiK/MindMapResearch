Oddly enough, not having enough vitamin D3 in your body can cause those problems as well. Since my mom has heart issues and is on medication she stated that she will check with her doctor about what vitamins and supplements she can take. I take 25mcg a day. That is 125% the RDA allowance. That was the lowest dose I could find at my store. Since I live in the Pacific Northwest and basically stay indoors, and also don't use dairy products, I didn't want to have a vitamin D deficit.

So many of his stories use religious leaders as the villains. He explained the law in the shortest way possible. And he never once used the word grace. Nothing about following Jesus was grace. It was action and responsibility. Christians today would call that works. Paul would call that works. James argued back that faith without works was dead.

Paul's writings reek of Greek culture and a pagan influence (nothing against pagans) that was common at that time. Zoroastrianism and other religious influences polluted the writings about Jesus and lifted him up to being a messiah and sacrifice. However, a reductionist would know that the O.T. forbids human sacrifices and already taught righteousness. The writings of Paul don't even get parts of the O.T. right. Judaic scholars laugh at the thought of Paul being a highly learned or high ranking Jew because of the words he chose when he (or others pretending to be him) wrote.  Everything about Paul appears to be larger than life. His writings are nothing like the very Jewish, (and I think) very human Jesus.

In closing, the 7 Noahide laws are easier to follow than the grace based lie (that comes packed with legalism) that Paul and Paulite Christian churches put out as the ""gospel"" and way to follow Jesus."

What you are feeling and experiencing is very common and very real. It is normal to be afraid, to feel confused, to feel lost. It is normal to feel alone. This subreddit has many people who have been through it and have learned to experience life on the other side of a religion they thought was everything. Your new journey must be taken at your own speed, for your own path. You will not lose your fear overnight. Things will not automatically make sense or get better. It was a scary thing when I left Christianity. It was terrifying. Worse, it felt like I lost my best friend (Jesus) and lost the best part of me at the same time. I have learned that those are normal things to feel. Our relationship (if we can call it that) with Jesus is often very emotional, based on feelings and the chemical rush and emotional needs it fills. You can't walk away from that marriage overnight. It takes time. Even if your rational mind can see the fatal flaws in your religion, your emotions are still very addicted and needy. What worked for me was to fill my mind with many different lectures, videos, blogs and websites that strengthened my rational mind and helped me to see that my experience with religion was very much like a drug addiction. And like a drug addiction, depending on how deeply you were hooked, there can be terrible withdrawals, and even a sense of losing something when you become sober from it. Like I said in my PM you don't have to go full atheist to know that your religion didn't work. You are at the beginning of an important journey. Strengthen your mind and feed it so that your emotions don't rule you. The fear of hell is what you speak of strongly. Therefore, I would recommend that you spend some time watching videos and studying online about the reasons why hell doesn't exist the way the Christians threaten that it does.

The game doesn't change you just feel and experience much of what has nothing to do with the actual game by being there in person. (For the record, I prefer watching football on TV. I prefer being there in person for baseball.)
