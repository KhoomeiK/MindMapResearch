The first few FSBOs I visited were the same as yours: I didn’t know what I was doing and they went with someone else. Even lately, I’ve seen new agents come along and just crush it right off the bat. It sucks, but stuff like that even happens to the big players. I’ve carved out some business for myself and learned a lot and became a good agent, and you can too!

I’ll steal a line from Ozark that I think fits this industry: “In our world, there are no victims, just volunteers.”

Also, and these are BIG, make sure you are keeping your endorphins up by exercising often. Be mentally aware of when negativity creeps in your mind. That shit has no place in your life"

The way we use flash cards is just by looking at the problem, calculating it with fingers or in his head, and then checking the problem on the back of the flash card. I can see why you'd think memorizing is inappropriate, but that's not what we're doing. Wrote memorization will come, and it has an incredible value that a lot of us in the West don't understand. 

We are not drilling him. We are making academics his friend; a part of life. Again, I'm not asking for your advice on this. Waiting until 11 is really stupid. The rest of the world is beating us and philosophies such as the one you subscribe to are the reason why."

I'm just trying to see if anyone can help me come up with a solution for when my son gets emotional when he makes mistakes.. I already decided to teach him math, among other things.

A little background: my son is bilingual. We've been doing flashcards with characters in his second language (Chinese) since he was almost two. We've been reading to him everyday since he was born, and he LOVES reading. We started math with cheez-its, and he really had a good time with it. Now, we just use flash cards and he prefers math over language. He's known his ABC's and how to count in both languages for a while already. 

We never push him. We aren't sitting him down while we stand at a chalk board. We use brief but frequent ""lessons"". We do a LOT of fun activities (cooking, gardening, rough-housing, sports, coloring, play-do.. you name it), and our lives certainly don't revolve around academics. 

I don't think he is some super gifted child. I'm just going along with his own progress and comfort level. Also, I DO think it's important that he gets comfortable with numbers.

I'm an American and strongly believe we parents should be doing more to set our children up to have better lives and harness the ability to contribute more to society. My wife and I aren't perfect parents, but we give our son a lot of love and compassion and are very conscious about how we raise him."
