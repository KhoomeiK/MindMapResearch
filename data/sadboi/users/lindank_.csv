BPD,ffrtyd5,t3_eun3et,1580165763.0,"Yes!! Tbh i didnt know what agoraphobia was until i was diagnosed with it, but it makes so much sense because i hate leaving the house alone to do absolutely anything. Sometimes the walk to the bus stop i feel like everybody is watching me, its kinda messed up. I feel like my house is a different world than what’s outside the door.. :("

I do this all the time, im in my own imaginary scenario or just in my own head from a past situation/event or whatever, and im moving my lips as if im talking but im not actually talking.. its so weird lol. Ive been doing it since i was younger though, i always thought it was just bcs of my imagination or something? :/"

BPDrecovery,f8npdtz,t1_f8nm0t1,1574649607.0,"the disassociating has definitely never been this bad. I'll have a conversation with someone, be talking about one thing and suddenly switch or get distracted and make a side comment and then not even a minute later im totally lost as to what we were talking about... :("
