depression,fm4v4cf,t1_flw4xvf,1585761378.0,That’s great that she understood. Glad to hear it worked out. Maybe I would have worded it differently tho like u make me happy but some things in my life don’t so it’s not u that’s causing me depression. But either way it worked out!

depression,flw3q2s,t3_frj91a,1585538859.0,"Depending on the time of person she is it could go many ways. I was in the same situation with my first relationship. I told my ex boyfriend I was depressed but it wasn’t his fault, I had been like that cause of experiences and he said “you should be happy cause you’re with me” I told him I was happy but the depression had nothing to do with him. It’s very hard for people to understand. After that he just got abusive and emotionally broke me down leading to a breakup. If she’s understand, just tell her the truth. Somethings need medical help or just resolve on its own after time. Wish u the best."
