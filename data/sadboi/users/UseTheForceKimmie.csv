Take your course of pain pills and once it is completed, if you are feeling like you can't function without more or if you are feeling withdrawal symptoms, TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR. They can help you navigate any potential addiction issues before they arise.

Bear in kind regarding the cost of childcare: that's just for keeping your kid alive. It doesn't cover the chores and errands most SAHMs also do. So in addition to working and losing most of a paycheck, all the chores are still waiting for you at home anyway.
