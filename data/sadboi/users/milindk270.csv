Chodi,fo31atl,t1_fo2d22q,1587478627.0,That is a bold generalization. I have muslim colleagues in my office from Hyderabad. And they all speak both Hindi and Telugu
Chodi,fo02o2o,t1_fnzpvi0,1587405019.0,"In our state board history text books in Assam we read about the Ahom kings in the north-east. It's a fascinating tale because it was a flourishing empire for a very long time. We also read about Sankar Deva  who was the pioneer of Bhakti movement and religious reforms in Assam. Also, there were fierce battles with the Mughals but for the most part, they were never able to invade the region (including Aurangzeb) and were always overpowered by the Ahoms. If you ever get time, do read about it"
singing,fny05lu,t1_fnxlxr4,1587350247.0,"Don't worry mate. You'll definitely improve. Practice everyday, and try to understand where you're going wrong. Post a recording and ask here if required. All the best!"
singing,fnx3ct5,t1_fnx35dq,1587330674.0,That's really cool. Was the honey a contributing factor in your vocal progress?

singing,fnvggvk,t3_g45932,1587292398.0,"I know a lot of people may disagree with me, but if you feel you can somewhat hit proper notes and want to polish your skills, and for any reason whatsoever, you just CANNOT get a personal vocal coach, then look up 'New York Vocal Coaching' by Justin Stoney on YouTube. He picks up a single technique/aspect in each video and explains the technicalities in detail. Also, he teaches in a way that makes the idea of actually improving your voice very believable, the lack of which, I think, is the problem with most other YT teachers. His techniques have worked wonders for me, but the key is, you need to know what are the major areas that you need to work on, with respect to YOUR voice. And this can be done by putting up your recordings on forums like these and asking for feedback. Also, you need to observe how actually your body reacts while you try to sing, like I used to experience immense strain while trying to hit high notes. Once you know these key areas, you can have a more streamlined approach to improving your singing. Hope this helps. All the best."

Chodi,fnkqqsa,t1_fnkphg4,1587037101.0,"But I think 70% of the people who vouch for a 'Hindu Rashtra' don't even consider these points, forget supporting them. And all I can infer from their arguments is Hindu majoritarianism and complete rejection of western ideologies, including theory of evolution and natural selection by Darwin, evidence-backed arguments about the origin of the universe etc."

TameImpala,fhia72h,t1_fhi9pec,1581620753.0,"Well, my favorite songs keep on changing man. Like lost in yesterday has been on loop since the day it was released. Now that I've listened to the entire album, I would say Tomorrow's Dust is quite catchy, maybe because I loved that snippet from the teaser. Also, Glimmer slaps hard. But after a week or 2 of listening I'll be able to figure out what I like the most. You know how tame songs work right. It requires patience, LOL."

WeAreTheMusicMakers,f3lqx01,t1_f3lpwfm,1570978715.0,"Yeah because the latency is kind of annoying. The 202HD does not have direct monitoring for mono outputs, so you can hear it only on the left channel. If you can go for 204, it would be better. In my country it wasn't available. So, I try to manage monitoring through my DAW. So yeah, latency is definitely an issue. But, that was all I could afford at the moment so I don't mind."
