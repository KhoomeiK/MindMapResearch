After the initial meeting and there after he stayed away and minded his business. Golden retrievers don’t have the instincts to be mean, they just want to try to play.

At one point my dog was my reason for living because he was such a handful and I couldn’t see him returned to the shelter for the 3rd time or my mom having to care for him. I know it’s silly, but still. But can you talk to your parents? Or friends? Do you want to try another Doctor? Is there something you enjoy? I used to reward myself a Coke and a hot fudge sundae because I made it through another day. I wasn’t hungry either, but it helped.
