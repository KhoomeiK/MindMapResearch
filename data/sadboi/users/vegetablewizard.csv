SandersForPresident,fn08j3n,t3_fyjezp,1586537356.0,"My version below- experienced folks, how do these sound? What methods are most effective?



To Douglas Kelner and Andrew Spano,


I am inquiring about the status of the scheduled June 23rd primary election. The wording of Senator Sander's announcement clearly states that his campaign is ""suspended,"" which is distinctly differentiated from ""cancelled."" The DNC convention will still be held, and as the only other candidate with a pending presidential campaign, Senator Sanders must remain on the ballot.


If you are truly in service for the public good and the continuation of a representative democracy, you will prepare for the primary to continue as scheduled. It is the right of a voter who is registered with the Democratic party to cast their vote in the primary election so that their candidate may negotiate during the DNC convention, allowing for the policies that matter to the American people to be presented and evolve the party platform.


Removing this right is an unethical act and will alienate and disenfranchise prospective voters. If New York State is truly a place to be ""Loved,"" the Board of Elections will do their service to the people of this state. If the democratic party is to earn their seats in office, they must do their duty to the people of this state and this nation.


Firmly and with Solidarity,


Zachary Scott
