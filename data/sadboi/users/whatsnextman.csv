Now, each of them has gotten a dedicated deep freeze for their hog carcasses. My dad had the head of one of the poor bastards piked on our fence, which was just so funny to everyone.

VeganForCircleJerkers,fpu2nva,t3_gfc751,1588903365.0,"I had the inverse of this problem with vegan groups on myspace back in the day. Everyone was decidedly plant-based but never for ethics, only for health. A local ""vegan"" group had weekly potlucks and I would go to a lot of them, but there was never any discussion about ethics. People there wore clothing and accessories fashioned from dead animals, bought designer dogs, and a lot of other non-vegan stuff.

Another newbie asked about dairy and the entire spiel from the organizer was about how cow's milk is poison to humans with nary a mention of what it means for cows. There were lots of rants about ""tofurkenstein"" products and there was once an argument about someone bringing a seitan dish. Their whole position was anti food industry with regards to human health (which definitely has valid points) so that's where their outrage was directed. Most of them were older folks, spacey types, so the hippie dippie woowoo flowed freely as well. 

I went vegan for the animals (duh) so I felt out of place but they were the only plant people I could find IRL for many years. I learned a lot about WFPB, even all this time I still follow it rather strictly as my vegan diet of choice, and it was cool to have camaraderie with other people who didn't eat meat. That was especially important since I'm from a clan of hootin', hollerin', huntin' hicks, but looking back on it now I laugh because I'd probably hate to have to spend as much time with them as I did then."

That emboldened me to really make it work. There was no way I would once again crawl back to Texas with tucked tail and that time was going to be different. It wasn't. I was in Oklahoma City (yeah, that's how good this plan was) for two weeks when my girlfriend got extremely sick and we had to move back to Texas. 

That was a recurring theme in this though, relationships. That's something I analyze a lot, if that was a bipolar thing, because I'm also just dumb for love and it didn't help that drugs were often involved. Then again, maybe my problems with those things were because of bp. shrug."

I've had a lot of similar thoughts. I came out of the worst depression I've ever experienced, got and held down a job longer than ever, and really started to pull things together the best I could before the pandemic hit. I lost my job and my routine fell apart. 

The first morning I woke up and didn't have to go to work, I thought to myself, *it would be cool if I got coronavirus because people would see that I was trying, I was doing everything right, and the world still fucked me over. If I died right now, I would be going out at undoubtedly the highest point of my life and nobody could hold anything against me.*

That actually started seeming very tantalizing to me, I can shamefully admit.

I also wonder if this is the preferable path for me. I'm unmedicated and was trying to improve my financial situation so I could take care of that but it was getting increasingly difficult to stay the course. Had I fucked up and blown off everything like I've always done, I don't know that I'd have come back from that. 

But getting to have a pity party while knowing this wasn't my fault has given me an odd sense of reassurance. Now I feel guilty that a pandemic that is killing and otherwise ruining so many lives may have been my saving grace and now I'm worried about squandering it because I'm getting anxious over all of this and ramping up to some shit.

Look, buddy. They're easy questions. You seemed *so sure* of your convictions when you felt it imperative to come into dedicated vegan spaces in defense of your lifestyle. Don't run away now. 

And don't hide behind ""well no one's going to change anyone's opinions online."" The internet has arguably been the most powerful tool for the spread of veganism. Whether it's revealing the inherently cruel practices of factory farming or guidance on how to deal with all of the oblivious, overly-sensitive, mealy-mouthed carnists we have to deal with in our daily lives, online discourse is where some absolutely tremendous growth takes place. You're in a subreddit full of vegans who had their worldviews challenged because of interactions *on the internet* and were able to change and grow for it.

Your projection is strong. Don't think that your attempt to portray me or any other vegans as some kind of unyielding, irrational person incapable of change has gone unnoticed. If you want to bail, go for it, but at least be adult enough to admit it is because *you* are the obstinate and spineless one who can't handle even a tiny amount of opposition."
vegan,fmme0xa,t1_fml29sb,1586203576.0,"To reiterate, you don't get to claim ""it's just a lifestyle"" when your lifestyle has a victim, no matter how prevalent or deeply ingrained in a culture it is. Many cultures, past and present, have had abhorrent practices that need to be fought every step of the way. Fortunately, cultures also change all the time. It's not an excuse to continue to do something destructive. ""Everyone's doing it"" is childish logic.

And nobody's ""forcing their lifestyle"" on you. Criticizing the glorification of animal cruelty via words on the internet is quite possibly the tamest thing vegans could do. Carnists are, however, forcing their lifestyle on innocent sentient animals for the sake of a snack. 

That's the funny (funny sad, not funny haha) thing about this: you're a part of a majority that enjoys disproportionate power and influence to spread *and* enforce their lifestyle on not just vegans but trillions of animals annually. There is a constant bombardment of reaffirmation of carnism in every level of our food systems, advertisement, television and film, and government action/inaction. 

You support forcefully breeding them, confining them, torturing them, and prematurely killing them. You continuously normalize and defend this and replenish your ranks by indoctrinating your children to do the same. The world constantly reaffirms you in this decision.

Despite this, you have the audacity to seek victimhood for mere criticism of your choice to be be part of an oppressive majority. You've even come to a vegan space like some whiny, entitled customer demanding to speak to the manager. That's fucking pathetic.

Anyway, you didn't answer any of the questions I asked you. I don't care about your weird little club that needs help to refrain from spanking it or how you conduct outreach. The trials and woes of pornography addiction pale in comparison to the destructive nature of animal agriculture and the urgency of this situation.

I will ask you again: is doing something always as valid as not doing that same thing? Or is there context and nuance that make the consequences vastly different and as such, we respond differently? Or is every choice to do something the same and valid as not doing that something and we should just accept that people will do both, so they should just be left alone?"

They've opened themselves up to commentary and criticism. These people posted a picture of their kid on in the internet, for the world to see, glorifying their lifestyle of eating tortured sentient beings as well as indoctrinating their kid to do the same.

I went to 5th through 8th grades in Missouri in the late 90s/early 00s and that's pretty much how slavery was treated, in my experience. My teachers were very nonchalant about it. None of them outright endorsed it or spoke sympathetically of the South but it was never talked about as the horrible atrocity it was.  It was just treated as a business model that made some people angry, so there was a war over it.

Ironically, it wasn't until I moved to Texas, of all places, that the gravity of slavery was finally taught to me in high school. Of course, that was summarily contradicted by all the jerking off of the ""heroes"" of Texas' struggle for independence, using the tears shed for the defenders of the Alamo as lube."

Pointing to modern adaptations as some kind of ""gotcha"" is also off base because that's just a result of people adjusting to a world not of their choosing or their creation. Holding on to what's left in whatever way they can is not irrational.

Now I do not agree with all of her logic or comment but this is something vegans need to confront in themselves if the message is going to be effectively spread. You can't just decide that a people's history and experiences are inconsequential, especially when it's a group of oppressed people (look up epigenetic inheritance and intergenerational historic trauma). Aside from being a little on the gross side, especially with the invocations of FGM and human sacrifice to illustrate a point, it's just not going to work.

You're being far too generous. He wasn't someone who didn't have the means to understand and explore veganism. He was a privileged, educated person who rejected it and vehemently attacked our mission for his own agenda and his own desires. As for many of us thinking like him, even if that is true none of us had the platform he did that we used to demonize veganism to the extent that he did. 

Aside from that, he had a not insignificant hand in that whole faux-woke, ""look Ma, I'm respectin' the whole animal!"" nonsense that reinforced in the average Joe the idea that they could humanely and honorably consume animals.

He never lived his life as someone who was poor, struggling, and desperate for *anything* to eat but boy he sure did love building his brand off of identifying with them and using them to justify his luxuries.

My family was very poor when I was growing up and I ate desperation, survival meals, the kind of which he paraded about with some smug, delusional sense of reverence for those who don't get to *choose* to eat that way part time and return to the comforts of the developed world when the camera stops rolling. His overall message of enjoy life and be grateful for what you have is fine but wholly negated by his own greed and wanton consumption and that of those who he influenced.

As for the, ""Don't talk bad about him, he's dead,"" crowd I agree, but only to the extent that he's not around to hear it. Everyone else who worshiped him and bought into his ideas needs to know how wrong and exploitative he was, with his positions on animals and people.

On the topic of suicide, he gets no sympathy from me. I was struggling with then-undiagnosed bipolar disorder, alienated from friends and family because of my illness, and contemplating suicide when I'd read his comments about how vegans should kill themselves if they couldn't enjoy a piece of stinky cheese. Veganism has been one of the only rock-solid things in my chaotic life, so that hit me particularly hard.

Am I happy that he struggled and killed himself? Not at all. I lost a great buddy earlier this year, the only other person who ever truly understood me, when he killed himself. It sucks, it's awful, and I don't wish that on anyone else but we never turned our negativity outward. 

Joking about suicide had long been one of my coping mechanisms, something to neuter an ever-looming threat to my life but I've never, ever suggested that someone else should kill themselves. I wouldn't dream of it, joke or not. Mr. Bourdain not only *didn't* have that consideration for anyone else, he used a ""joke"" (if it was even that, who knows) about suicide to build his brand.

vegan,f0ku6gt,t1_f0kj959,1568688199.0,"The thing with deer as a nuisance (to themselves and humans) is weird because I know that's a problem in certain places, but then you have some places that feed deer or outright farm them to be released into the wild for people to shoot. I don't take a uniform stance on it because it's different depending where you go.

But yeah, hunters truly are a mixed bag. My dad, for example, is a hunter and I hunted (and fished and trapped) until I was almost 14. My dad grew up in extreme poverty that Americans don't like to think existed in America in the last 50 years, living in three walled shanties and campers, and he killed animals to survive. He ate whatever he could kill, including rats, pigeons, squirrels, snakes, lizards, and I'm pretty sure a cat or dog here and there. 

Things were better by the time he had a family but not a whole lot. I at least never had to eat some of the stuff he did. That I know of, anyway. We moved to a place with one of the largest feral hog populations in America, so we ate them a bunch. Didn't even have to go out to get them because they would frequently wreck our crops and the chickens we kept, get in our trash, or get killed in the road. Much like deer, they're a big problem for some people.

My dad still hunts, which I obviously disagree with, but I'd dare to say it's an inseparable part of his essence. He hunted young and often. It put food in stomach and sometimes money in his pocket, and under those circumstances, he pretty much had no other choice. There's a possibility that we wouldn't be alive if he didn't do that and he knows that, so when I talk to him about veganism, he gets upset. He thinks if he admits that it's wrong to eat animals now that he's somehow admitting that it was wrong then, which I don't believe. Even trying to tell him it's about what he's doing now, he just has this mental block. He thinks hunting is natural and honoring animals and all that shit, and given his upbringing, I just accept it. I can never change that. Maybe it will click in his head some day or someone else will do it but I can't.

By that same token, I got him to stop eating factory farmed meat from fast food restaurants and grocery stores by appealing to that side of him. His justification is that he eats animals to survive, so I pointed out that eating a Triple Meat Whataburger for lunch or throwing a bunch of dead animals in his grocery cart isn't about survival, it's about greed and privilege and called him a city boy. As far as I know, since then he hasn't eaten animals other than the one or two deer and hog a year that he keeps in his freezer. That's as close to a victory as I can get with him.

So knowing him and his story, I try to look at each individual hunter because I know they're not all bloodthirsty people getting off on hunting animals. I want to see what makes them tick and what I consistently find is that a lot of them are just delusional. I've argued a bunch with hunters who think their kids will starve to death - like literally die of nutritional inadequacy - if they don't eat meat, so that's why they hunt. I explain that I haven't eaten meat since 2005 and am not like a WWE guy but clearly not underweight or physically deficient and it like breaks their brains. 

And I mean, that's not to say there isn't merit to some of what they believe. I understand entirely not wanting to eat an animal that was blasted with antibiotics or treated like shit. My solution is to just eat plants and theirs is this convoluted survivalist fantasy that reeks of disaffected people finding identity in pseudo-naturalistic endeavors that don't mesh with the rest of their morals. And it pisses me off because my dad had a truly shitty upbringing. I think he might actually have some form of PTSD from his early life and these yahoos want to basically cosplay and pretend that's what they are. And that's something that always infuriated me about Anthony Bourdain and the types who bought into his message. He was some privileged jetsetter getting paid to travel around the world and eat with people who had a fraction of what he had, and then blasted his message around the world for other privileged yahoos to use as an excuse their own shitty behavior in completely different circumstances.

I hear you about the ""just crazy"" and ""too sensitive"" thing. I said in another discussion on this sub that I try not to talk about being vegan IRL because people think I'm crazy and think less of veganism and it's because of that.

VeganForCircleJerkers,ezsmgcu,t3_d1xal3,1568097727.0,"Sorry that happened. My undiagnosed, untreated bipolar 2 disorder manifested itself around the same time I went vegan, so navigating the two things have been largely inseparable (my parents have actually argued about which caused which ðŸ™„). I was generally forgiving of myself for the accidents but sometimes I would be in such an awful frame of mind that I really took it out on myself. 

It wasn't so much that I thought negatively of myself for it but it really just made me hate the world. I've seen numerous vegans around the 'net say things like, ""Ugh, milk in x product. This just makes me want to die,"" and I take pause because that shit really did make me want to fucking die. It wasn't just hyperbole or for the purpose of venting. I was never into cutting but I did engage in other forms of self-harm, particularly drugs and alcohol, and did a lot of really dangerous, really stupid shit. 

There was a time when I found out that I was eating tortillas cooked with lard in them (I was assured by two different people that they were cooked with coconut oil) and I was in that mode that led me to thinking it was just the best reason ever to try cocaine for the first time. So I did and it sparked a four day bender that culminated with me jumping into an icy river in the dead of winter and having to be rescued by firefighters. Full disclosure, that wasn't the last time I did coke.

I guess what I'm trying to say is that I *really* took these things to heart. It really fucked with me and I didn't know why until almost ten years later when I finally found out that I am bipolar and it has been almost four more years trying to figure out how to live with it. 

The thing is, as I've gone through attempts to treat it, I've come to realize that taking it that hard was perfectly reasonable. Seeing this disgusting ubiquity of animal agriculture for what it is and being so moved by it that it inflames my senses is not bizarre or irrational. The things I do as a result of it might be, sure, but being that bothered by it should be the normal thing. 

Dipshit carnists who want to wave a piece of bacon in our faces or eat two burgers to make up for us not having any all because we *don't* want to hurt animals? Politicians who want to fuck over animals and the environment because some rich fuck slipped something in his pocket?

That, and so much more of the twisted shit done in the name of carnism that people generally downplay or ignore, is the fucked up, bizarre, macabre shit that people should be trying to figure out how to deal with.
