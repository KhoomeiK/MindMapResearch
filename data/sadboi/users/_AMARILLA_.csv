Stoicism,eq9xd6c,t3_bxr0t7,1559920159.0,"I dont know what the other person wrote. But what you're saying is exactly what I'm looking for.  I'm interested in learn how to evolve throughout each experience and pain and heartache.   

I'm not here for consolation or sympathy.  Heck, I'm not even angry anymore. And I had a talk with my SO this morning. Everything is clear and we have a plan. 
I'm here to learn how to stop emotionall and mental self harm.

I'm ok with affairs, I understand I cant be everything to my SO, and sometimes it truly is ""just sex"" 
But I'm not ok with my emotional reaction to the situation.  My mind and my heart aren't on the same page.   

 Its masochism and not in a good way"

TrueOffMyChest,eq71goe,t3_bx68yu,1559838941.0,"I also went through something similar. But  after 1 year 5 months and 13 days of tears, self doubt, self loading, hate, love, and everything in between. I can say that I am in a much better place, mentally, emotionally, physically.  I'm at my best.  Im 36 and I'm on my way to the unknown, and I love it. 

People come and leave us all the time, is up to you to decide what you make with that time.  Nothing is forever, everything   changes, evolves, even grief.  Find the best possible way for you to evolve as well.

This  shall also pass, you'll get through. Sending you all the best vibes"

They told me they're were going to open an investigation. A week later, the coworker got a slap on the hand. The following week, my schedule changed dramatically and I had extra work. This continued until I quit. 
Before I left tho, I told the coworker what I really think about her.  I was unemployed, and drowning in debt, but it I felt fucking great."
