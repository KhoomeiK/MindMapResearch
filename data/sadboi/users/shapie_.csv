One comment even said that it‚Äôs his right to use her as his ‚Äúfuck slut‚Äù any time to make up for the lack of porn, even though the OP said they were already having regular sex. Just like the whole maintenance sex thing, it all ties into an overarching theme that men feel like they should have autonomy over our bodies and are entitled to use us for their own pleasure."

antipornography,fqg1bxw,t1_fpv2xiz,1589335883.0,What he really means is sex is too much effort because he has to consider the notion that perhaps she might need to be pleasured too for it to be a valuable experience for both parties.

Anxiety,fp2u9wm,t3_gaarcc,1588267993.0,"My anxiety is 90% physical. I had my first real panic attack while driving 4 years ago (I was 19) and I genuinely felt like I was having a heart attack. Pain and tingling down both arms, super tight chest, couldn't breathe, couldn't speak, extreme fear, felt like I was going to throw up.  When I moved to a big city a year and a half ago, I had panic attacks every. single. night.

They feel SO real. The brain is incredibly powerful and extraordinarily convincing. It feels impossible to discern whether it's just anxiety or if there's actually something wrong. I get pain on my left side (jaw, arm, shoulder, etc.) during panic attacks too which doesn't help. I subconsciously clench up my left side more when I'm anxious and grind the left side of my jaw more in my sleep. I got a physical and an EKG last November and everything came back normal, but I still worry every time I have one. It really sucks. My heart goes out to everyone who deals with the same thing. :("

progresspics,fovc2op,t3_g9spc7,1588098818.0,"On January 1, 2020 I started doing keto after being generally dissatisfied with my body. I did powerlifting from 2017-mid 2019 and missed the curves I had gained. I'm 5'2"" and clocked in at 131 lb ‚Äî I wasn't overweight, but I wanted to tone up and lose a bit of fat. I have been out of the gym for a quite a while due to major gym anxiety (I moved from my hometown in late 2018 and haven't found I gym I feel comfortable in yet).

I did strict keto until mid-March. By this point, I was 122.4 lb. I decided to quit keto because it was super high maintenance and switched to 16:8 IF. I did IF throughout the month of April in conjunction with Chloe Ting's 5 Week Booty Challenge. I'm still eating in a deficit now as I'm trying to reach my goal weight of 115. Recently, the weight has been soooo stubborn and I haven't lost anything since mid-March.

My plan for the future is to take the next few days off and start Chloe Ting's Hourglass Challenge on May 1st. I still plan on eating in a deficit of around 1500-1600 calories a day in order to lose the rest of the weight and then eat at maintenance once I hit my goal. I'm mostly focused on tracking protein but I'm still eating relatively low carb (30% protein, 30% carbs, 40% fat). While I was doing her challenge, I didn't gain or lose inches but I feel a LOT stronger. I'm hoping to eventually find a gym I like enough to go regularly (when quarantine is over), but for now, this definitely works for me.

StrongCurves,fov38gg,t3_g9r8xq,1588094658.0,"On January 1, 2020 I started doing keto after being generally dissatisfied with my body. I did powerlifting from 2017-mid 2019 and missed the curves I had gained. I'm 5'2"" and clocked in at 131 lb ‚Äî I wasn't overweight, but I wanted to tone up and lose a bit of fat. I have been out of the gym for a quite a while due to major gym anxiety (I moved from my hometown in late 2018 and haven't found I gym I feel comfortable in yet). 

I did strict keto until mid-March. By this point, I was 122.4 lb. I decided to quit keto because it was super high maintenance and switched to 16:8 IF. I did IF throughout the month of April in conjunction with Chloe Ting's 5 Week Booty Challenge. I'm still eating in a deficit now as I'm trying to reach my goal weight of 115. Recently, the weight has been soooo stubborn and I haven't lost anything since mid-March.

My plan for the future is to take the next few days off and start Chloe Ting's Hourglass Challenge on May 1st. I still plan on eating in a deficit of around 1500-1600 calories a day in order to lose the rest of the weight and then eat at maintenance once I hit my goal. I'm mostly focused on tracking protein but I'm still eating relatively low carb (30% protein, 30% carbs, 40% fat). While I was doing her challenge, I didn't gain or lose inches but I feel a LOT stronger.
