No one understands that I don't want to get to that point. I don't want to be angry. I don't want to yell, I don't want to cry. It's emotionally and mentally exhausting to the point where you need a 12 hour sleep, but one of tge many side effects is that the chances of me sleeping is pretty much 50/50 every time I hit the sack. 

People who say that I can control it and/or that it's not an excuse to be a ""dick"" are more often than not, just upset that they're feeling like shit after pressing buttons or shoving people with a mental disorder into an episode. The rest just simply don't understand it and don't care to take the time to understand how our brains work. You wouldn't expect a wheelchair bound person to walk.

MaladaptiveDreaming,fq9kwua,t1_fq9j68x,1589201142.0,"Yeah but the chances of anyone actually going for me is less than 20%. I'm sick of being lonely, I'm sick of the people I know and love giving me about 10% of their attention span. I talk, I get interrupted. I try my hardest to function, I can't. I'm like a cesspool of depression that just glides through life, not even sure if I can make anything happen for myself while people feel like they have the right to tell me that I shouldn't be absolutely terrified of taking risks that could absolutely cause me to live on the street. 

I have nothing going for me except stressing how I'm going to handle anything that comes my way as I'm consistently on the verge of losing my mind til the point of no return and by then, I'll be in the psych ward with doctor ass hat, who causes me so much anxiety that I would rather attempt chew my own limbs off in exchange for a day in ICU than spend half an hour with him, then forced to take a round of sedatives because I've gone completely off the rails. 

So, I'm sorry if my methods bother you, but they work for me."

Don't tell me that you're donating to this that or what. Unless a perfectly fine vaccine comes out to stop me and the rest of us from getting COVID-19 and everything turns back to semi normal, I don't care. 

God, I feel like a manic bird rattling it's cage."

You could, if you like, make any meme last as long as you wanted, but it's relevancy depends on the group of people who love memes.

rupaulsdragrace,fq8x6qn,t1_fq8n1qs,1589178197.0,"I can understand where your coming from, but I think it has more to do with getting out of an old shell than getting pissed off with fans. For example, we all knew that Miley Cyrus used to be Hannah Montana, it's a part of her past and she knows it and has done her best to get out of that shell. You won't run up to her screaming ""HANNAH MONTANA!!"", because she's Miley Cyrus and her songs are sung as Miley Cyrus. 

Imagine how many Crystal Methyd fans have hounded her to create more of her old content, especially when she doesn't want to. Everyone loves Crystal, so naturally, a lot of people will ask her to do things she doesn't want to. She doesn't want her old content being spread around, she's asked politely for it to stop and people still do it. Yes, it does hurt one's feelings to be shamed by one of their favorite queens, but it's just a request."

I wanted nothing more than to make it big and accomplish something in my life, but I couldn't figure out if I wanted to make a profit for myself or if I wanted it for the fame. 

You Are Not Alone - Micheal Jackson. I've recently made a friend who've I've confided in recently and told him about my thoughts on suicide. After a lengthy conversation, he said ""You are not alone"" to me. I listened to the song and I related to the lyrics in some way. 

Just Like A Prayer - Madonna. I know what the song's _really_ about, but I see it more as a song about finding life and happiness within yourself and sharing it with others. 

True Colors - Cyndi Lauper. I found this dong after I came out, my mom didn't take it too well. I'd listen to True Colors and would pretend that it was my mom singing it to me

Hold On - Good Charlotte. This song helped me through the roughest of days."

AskReddit,fq80uus,t3_ghbuxi,1589156216.0,"I used to do work experience for a movie theater in my city, for around a month. A woman and her kids would come in every Tuesday. No matter what we did, said or accommodated to and for her, she would always be unhappy, she would always have something rude to say. 

The worse was during the Hannah Montana movie premiere. During child movie premieres, the theater gets absolutely trashed and because we needed to keep up with a set time, we'd have about 6 workers cleaning the theater and two at the start of the queue to hold people up. I was one of the workers holding up the queue.

The woman aka ""Karen"" first took the chance at purposely spilling her popcorn. She immediately complained, saying that the carpet tripped her, so it was the theaters fault and she wanted a new one. So, the other co worker told her she'd replace the one she had. She didn't want that. She wanted the one she dropped and another. My coworker told her we couldn't do that. She immediately said, ""well why not?"" My co worker told her that in order to get a replacement, she'd have to exchange the new one for the old one. She wasn't happy. 

A couple minutes later, my co workers were still working on the theater and she starts complaining on not being able to go in. Granted, we were running 2 minutes overtime, but we were trying as best as we could. My co worker ran in to help them and I was left to hold the fort. Karen automatically starts spewing comments like ""Why can't we go in? This is ridiculous! I paid for this movie!"" And ""I have every right to go in! I'm gonna talk to your boss and get you fired!"" I kept trying to reason with her, she wouldn't have it. 

The final blow was ""You're probably a real asshole to everyone, judging from the way you're treating me and my kids!"" My boss stepped in, told me to help my co workers, then told the Karen to leave. I had a good time with my coworkers the rest of the day, but that Karen is the reason why I never want to work a job with crowds of customers again."
