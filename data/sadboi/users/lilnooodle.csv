BreakUps,f9cshgn,t3_e4iq7p,1575226927.0,"Think of of the same way grief works, because you are losing someone that you love. 

So imagine your brain like a big empty room with a big red button in the middle of it and a smaller ball bouncing from wall to wall. As it bounces from wall to wall it also hits rush red button which is the trigger of your memories. Over time that button will get smaller so the ball bouncing around will hit the button less and less frequently. It probably won‚Äôt ever fully go away because they had a significant impact on your life. 

Time really does heal. And for those times you‚Äôre struggling with the memories coming up, let yourself feel the emotions. It‚Äôs the only way you‚Äôll let it go, by letting it out. Find something positive to express your emotions into. Usually for break ups I wrote poetry. I know some people play music or even just eating your favourite food. 

You‚Äôll be ok üíõ"

I apologize I fell asleep before I could respond to this.
