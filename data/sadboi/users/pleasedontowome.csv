Just because shes saying she may never get married doesnt mean shes getting it to pretend to be married. She just seems to like the concept of nice rings. Some people dont get married out of choice, it's not something that automatically happens when someone finds ""basic love""."

Edit: looking at your comment history I've concluded that you're a racist piece of shit that thinks domestic violence is okay. I dont think you're going to get ""basic love"" either if you think this woman who seems to just like rings definitely wont. Don't say someone else is a loser for not being loved when you're someone so dislikable yourself."
