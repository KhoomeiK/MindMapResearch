I am in the same boat - where I have no friends. As long as I‚Äôm doing something, like reading a book, riding my bicycle, working out, watching a movie, or just about anything will help as long as you don‚Äôt stop and try and stay busy. Do it for yourself, no matter how hard! Someone may realize that you‚Äôre awesome, as most of us are in the same boat when we get older... having a lot of friends is rare. You‚Äôll get there though! You just have to be honest, open and willing to spend time with yourself...! Sorry for the novel. Message me if you feel like or at least message someone else on here!

But that doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs a one way street/ or one sided. What I‚Äôm saying is that, you need to set your own boundaries with others and have time for yourself... while others need the same thing. You should do things for yourself with that time, like clean, have a hobby to focus on, read, run your own errands, work out, meditate etc. etc. You don‚Äôt have to know what other people are doing with their time, as you should mind your own business, but they too do not need to know what you‚Äôre doing. I find that if I keep my personal business personal I start to value myself more and build confidence by working on myself. Before this I was completely an open book and had no regard or respect for myself (& others). I don‚Äôt know what else I can tell you that has helped me but doing this has helped me have a higher sense of integrity for myself and I have found I‚Äôm not constantly worried about what someone else is doing nor do I have FOMO as much. You‚Äôd probably healthier and happier also. Good luck!"

I have no passion(s) and I wish I did or was motivated to do anything worthwhile. I can‚Äôt even read because I have ADD and nothing interests me for no more than 5 minutes. I like drawing but since I‚Äôve stopped idk how to start again or a reason why... I usually like making things for others, but idk if anyone who would want anything or what to draw. I‚Äôm so lazy it‚Äôs embarrassing and nothing seems to inspire me. I wish someone else cared so I would care, and I mean my parents care, but it‚Äôs just different. I wish someone other than my family cared. I mostly wish I naturally cared more about myself. Idk life with mental illness is rough. Even when I try to explain to others how hard it is they either don‚Äôt believe me and think I‚Äôm just saying that as an excuse or that it doesn‚Äôt really affect just about every facet of my life... when it does. I hate what one poster on here described as, ‚Äúalways waiting for their life to start,‚Äù which is what I feel like all the time, if I‚Äôm aware.

I would just be careful with isolating too often... but I do understand why you feel the feelings you described.
