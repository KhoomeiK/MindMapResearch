In reality, I used to be able to recall vivid details of things even from my childhood.

What's twisted about depression, is that it doesn't just affect recall of memory, it affects perception of how recent the memory is.  If I exhaust my energy, given enough time I can recall specific details of certain events that happened; that in my perception were pretty recent. But memory is only relevant to the amount of new experiences you have each day. I barely leave my house to have new experiences.  So it comes as a shock when someone mentions to me ""I haven't seen you in a while!"" or ""wow it's been so long since ____ happened!""

movies,eoovk89,t1_eoogni2,1558748843.0,"Honestly, I think the downer ending would still get the same reception today. [Here's what the director said in an interview:](http://collider.com/frank-oz-interview-little-shop-of-horrors-original-ending/)

>One was when one is having a character on-stage killed, that character comes back for a bow. In a movie, the character does not come back for a bow. That character is dead, and because they loved Ellen and Rick so much they were very upset at the end. Itâ€™s not that they didnâ€™t like the movie, itâ€™s the end they didnâ€™t like. They hated the fact that we killed our stars.

I highly doubt the target audience for movie-musical adaptations appreciate such a downer ending to that extent; even knowing the original ending of the stage show and original film. As you implied, the majority of people go to movies to see things work out; at least *in some capacity* because it's part of the escapism. Things don't work out in real life, so when the main character (let alone, the *world*) doesn't get thrown a bone hope; people will get mad.

CPTSD,eogr4xz,t3_br9swt,1558563872.0,"I think the most important thing is being self aware that there actually is a problem, and keeping it in the forefront of your mind throughout adulthood that your experience *was not* normal. Internalizing it, and normalizing it means submitting to it and ultimately repeating the behavior down the road. It takes a conscious effort to keep reminding ourselves that this isn't the way it should be. Secondly, there has to be a conscious change to *create* the environment you didn't have, rather than fall back on repeating the toxicity that you received.  It's often easier said than done, because there's no positive frame of reference other than what you imagine how things should have went... Without the energy to spare, we may just fall back on mimicking the behavior we experienced.

Do you think you could take your brother aside one day and bring up your observation with him? If he's as authoritarian as you said, than maybe it would fall on deaf ears; but maybe it takes the words of someone who has gone through the same thing but chose a different path to make him see what he has become."

An example is the Gospel singer Mandisa whose close; God-fearing, pregnant friend was diagnosed with breast cancer.

AsianParentStories,eo8zqmy,t3_bqwoh8,1558378629.0,"Very, very relatable. I have a very unhealthy relationship my body and with food. Ever since grade school, my family went to all-you-can-eat buffets for every occasion. It's the best bang-for-your-buck, in my parents' minds. The start of this year was a very stressful time in my life, and I gained 10 lbs; but I would hide the developing double chin I was self conscious about well by contouring. But when I'm with my family, I don't bother wearing makeup. While we were at the buffet with my family, she said outloud as a general statement ""Be careful everyone, don't eat too much food, or you'll get more chins."" I felt the sting in my bones from such a passive observation.

I have a tanner family friend who reminded me of my cousin personality wise when I was younger. I told my mother the comparison, and my mom said ""No way! Your cousin is so much prettier!""

My face is also 4 shades darker than my chest, which is a completely normal thing because of sun exposure. But I constantly wear collared shirts and look for full coverage foundations in the lighter shade to not look like a reverse eagle. I know the foundation is supposed to match the neck and chest anyway, but part of me is wondering if I do it because I want show people ""Hey! I'm not actually this dark, it's just my face!"" I don't really like swimming because of germs and filth, but I believe this is a factor as well. 

All these seemingly little things add up in my head lead me to poor self esteem and feeling unworthy to find someone who could fall in love with me."
