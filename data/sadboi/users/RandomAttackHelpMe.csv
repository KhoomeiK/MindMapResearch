Weight has been up and down a long time. I was fat, had surgery lost weight, gained weight, stopped drinking a few years back and lost like 40 lbs, although I don't remember how long it took. Put weight back on over the years and it's been up and down and been trying to lose it. That being said, there's been no peak so to say. I have little relationship experience, although I met someone and we've been seeing each other for a few months, I don't care what they say about you have to be happy with yourself first and all that other kneejerk bullshit, yes, it's true, they're not totally wrong about it. But having someone be there and to spend time with does make a world of difference, 

Not or was not a virgin before this, but might as well been as it had been a long time.

Also meds make a difference. So I have been having sleep problems lately, sometimes I can't get to sleep and sometimes it's been caffeine late at night, but even then I was able to get to sleep, so I was on like no sleep today. Coffee helps. So apparently, it's my roommates birthday, we get along fine, she's a nice enough person, her boyfriend? I think, I may have overheard they are poly, not assholes actually so it makes things bearable, has been staying here. I don't mind, not jealous, but the loneliness pangs kick in.

Let's take the height debate for example. It's no surprise women want a tall man. The same way weight is an indication of attraction for men, *height* is an indication of attraction for *women.* But the short men on here have shown an intense hatred and lashed out at women who have simply stated their preference for tall men without attacking short men in the process.

I'm not saying that doesn't happen, but you're generalizing way too much. As they say, #notallmen, SARCASM! People are bigger on personality than you realize. Yes attraction and all that, but eventually, they want something a little more stable. And women don't judge men for similar things?"

Never mind looks, status, money, although that one is pretty important, it's also about meeting/finding the right person and not getting fucked over by them.

For years/a very long time now, as this is not something that just happened overnight, the pc/feminist/sjw/super unrealistic liberals etc. shielded/protected/looked out for anyone, esp. women, why do you think people lose their shit over ""fat shaming""?, who did not ""fit the norm"", and stood up for the equality for them, not the worst idea, but not when it's as one sided, and ""Fought the oppressive patriarchy of men! and unrealistic beauty standards as seen in magazines!"" etc, and kept telling such individuals ""You deserve only the best! and never settle!""

All the meanwhile, telling such short men and the like they need to ""be more fair"" and ""not as entitled"" Etc. Not saying those aren't problems, but when you tell one thing to one side and one to the other, what do you think is going to happen?

This is what happens when you take the idea of equality and apply to one side, and then get surprised when the other goes ""Well what about me?"", that's inevitable, you can't please everyone, but that is inevitable.

Remember bagel boss freak out guy? Remember when that happened? I do. When I first saw the video, I was def. like, dude needs to chill the fuck out, but if this had been some trans gendered doesn't know what the fuck they are, has 3 dicks hanging out the side of their ass, it's a different story. This is what happens when people are ignored and not given help.

Know what else happens? That anger and frustration is turned into votes, and Trump gets elected. And he probably will again. Just saying.

After all, this dude didn't get the same level of public scolding when he/she did the same thing:

&#x200B;

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOkdR7on6Ok](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOkdR7on6Ok)

&#x200B;

Also, see, dudes, or certain dudes, see certain truths others don't. I will give you such an example. I work with this guy, we get along fine and we make a good team he and I, so his long term gf, like she's been there for him, loyal etc, like she's not just a casual fling, and they have 2 kids. Well, he's been cheating on her and sleeping with every single chick he can. Oh and yet she sort of catches him and yet still stays with him, I guess chalk that up to either unyielding loyalty/fear of being alone/if she leaves him, esp with 3 kids, she has one from a previous relationship, dad from that one was gay, or the whole if she leaves him, she will be on her own etc. You think he tells the gf or these chicks that? He plays them like a fiddle, I say nothing cause unless someone is going to suck my dick, why the fuck should I do anything?

He's not exactly a ""winner"", he lives at home, sells weed, not that I care, but I suspect he sells more, and uh, has weapons and even sells them I believe as he's shown me. He's also a lil too spoiled/kind of a mama's boy, his father died sadly, and I'm not going to make fun of sad things or personal tragedies or losses despite my wise ass tone, so he like tries to get others to do things for him he could do on his own.

Anyways, this is all result, and I am referring to your short man problem, of the ever growing hyper awareness that has resulted from the near endless constant stream of social media and people realizing that uh, what they were told or assumed to be true wasn't, and then the other side, people like you or those who were surprised Trump won, not being able to see or accept the other half going ""Well what about me?/Yeah well hey fuck you too"". It happens.

 

&#x200B;

Anyways, we discuss things like, why does he do this? Why does he cheat, although he doesn't see it as that, what would you do if you caught her doing the same thing, he said he would make her and the other guys life hell, for those who aren't as perpetually successful in the areas of love and other things, this is hurts, hurts a lot. Sure some of them handle it better, but for those whom it has not been solved, well look what happens. So when they see someone getting a ""Free pass to be shitty"", it kind of upsets them. Think about that.

&#x200B;

Well, what do you think happens when you have a change in cultural values and a shift from traditions? I'm not even talking religious fundamentalism stuff. I mean a more so realistic social agreement of appreciation, trust, and respect. You replace that with an almost non-stop sense of I'm going to get as much as I can and want with no limits and no one stopping me cause I am just either greedy or entitled enough to do it. Mixed with lax social feelings and influence on such casual enough relationships, and yes, what people do in the privacy of their own home and lives is their business, however, when you kind of can't keep it to yourself or try to make it everyone else's problem, you're crossing a certain limit most people have. 

&#x200B;

Like it's one thing if well, you got the main chick and well, a side chick or two, I can see the problem(s) with that but let's not deny anything. And then on top of that, you just want more and more. And/or then if you're one of said side chicks, well you go and complain about where's the good guys etc? Again, why do you think mra and mgtow is a thing? Where do you think most of these guys are coming from?

Those who throw out ""virgin"", ""bitter angry incel loner loser"" as casual insults, some of them mean it, some of them are trying to hurt others, for most of them though, and let's not kid ourselves, this is political. 

To those who throw out such terms, they see these bitter angry dewdz!!!! as the reason/fault as to why Senor El Trumpo is los presidente. They're not totally wrong, however, this whole altright/redpill/mra thing was going on as clear as fucking day in front of them. It's not their fault if they say and state as clear as day, which btw, happened on here, reddit, when the altright forum was still on here. 

Banning them was one of the dumbest fucking things they could have done, I do not identify as such, but when you have a movement with the influence they have,controversies and all, and they are stating what they will do, elect Trump, and you have that as a resource and then ban them over some hurt fucking feelings bullshit, is beyond fucking dumb.

&#x200B;

Of course they are contradicting themselves. Think they give a fuck? I'm not even this like arch conservative type, but to them, it's hurting Trump and the base, when the focus should be on winning elections.

I've said it before and I will say it again, the start of all of this was Elliot Rodger. Yes, he had some problems and needed help he clearly was not getting. Thing is, he was posting the videos saying what he was going to do. Now I know the internet/social media is vast and wide, but when you have someone stating they are going to do something like that, and everyone is so fucking apathetic and self absorbed to where no one does anything? Something ain't right there.

I mean, when you have something like that happen, he pretty much was the penultimate boogeyman for the ultra pc leftists who again, knew this whole redpill mra thing was happening as clear as day in front of them, yet were still in denial somehow, and the amount of well, lonely dudes who could relate, when you have it on that scale, something needs to change.

Or I'm a drug dealing player who cheats on his baby momma with tons of side chicks who keeps saying I will stop after she's just had my second kid and I will still lecture others on how to ""be fly"". Or I just conned someone out of their money, or I live in a fabulous mansion with a cardre of hot chicks that I got from selling drugs and ruining lives, or I act like a total asshole cause I can etc.

Well yes, they should be mad at the politicians and factory owners who did this to them, why wouldn't they be? In what world do you live in where people are not mad or critical of politicians for the things they do? 

Like if someone has a successful career, money, and it's taken away due to outside forces and factors, nothing the person did, they're just supposed to gee golly gosh! Time to adapt! ? Again, in what magical world does this happen?

Well, why do you think people voted for Trump? He has been creating jobs. Well while volunteering is nice, it's not going to solve people's financial problems and concerns. Again, in what world does that happen? 

Also:
It is the equivalent of telling all of the workers in the rust belt to learn to code and it is their fault if they end up homeless because they refuse to change with the times.

Yes. He is totally right. This is some next level adapt or get fucked over thing. We can get into issues of getting outside the comfort zone sure, but when someone learns their job/skill and are then told well time to adapt or gtfo!!!!!, what do you think is going to happen? 

And adapt to what exactly? Keeping up with social media bullshit? Celebrity worship gossip crap? Weird online beta orbiting worship? Every crappy new tv show and band that comes out?

Well, as eye rolling inducingly ridiculous as it sounds, yes. Not to be a condescending asshole, but where have you been the past decade? Why do you think in a fairly large part, or at least strongly related too, Trump is president? 

See, and I'm not bashing anyone or going after anyone or have a vendetta, but when Obama first won, the left thought everything was going to just magically change cause their guy won. 

Then you had the whole right wing/tea party response to it. Then the lefts response was hey! This isn't supposed to be happening! Our guy won! The rest of you need to just shut up and go away! Obv. not getting the memo that's now how this works.

So instead of like, you know, trying to win elections and have actual impact, they decided to go after cultural things that where, sure, maybe overrated a bit and perhaps held a bit TOO sacred by some people. Music, books, movies, shows, what do you think this whole woke bullshit is?

And while I realize and accept it's a double edged sword, free speech and the whole critical aspects, going after these otherwise petty cultural things in some super fucking half assed attempt to what? Tell off those right wingers? Think it will actually enact the magical change they think will happen? It makes no sense. At all. 

So while everyone was upset that their cultural sense were not affirmed in all aspects, we do remember the non-stop rolling shitshow that was the endless debates and articles over that fucking ghostbusters remake right? Cause we all know in what was probably the key election, the most important thing is arguing with angry fucking fanboys? Instead of like, trying to win an election.

&#x200B;

So Trump wins, and anyone who was even at least half paying attention wasn't surprised, and those on the left couldn't comprehend. So again, instead of like, trying to win an election, they decide they will not only go after Trump supporters/sympathizers, something I don't agree with it, they are going to make life hell for them. So for those who are seen as ""broken"" or ""failed"", they are somehow, before they've even said anything, they get tagged altright, not only for not tagging the proverbial liberal line, which is ironic, cause the left for YEARS tried their own brand of help which amounted to nothing more than be more liberal/feminist over and over.

It's also this like reverse morality as I can best put it at the moment. These ""failed broken men"" who ""could not conform to the demands of the patriarchy and traditional masculinity!!!! and the power structure when they should have followed our magical liberal ways!!!"" get kicked to the curb for well, not choosing to be magically liberal like the rest of them. Make sense? So yeah, instead of well, helping said men, they just want to pick at them more and more.

All I can say is, Trump already won once, chances are he will likely win again. The only Democrat who I think has a good shot is Sanders, provided he doesn't fuck up and they don't fuck him over again.
