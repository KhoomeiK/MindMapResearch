At least for me, my anxiety usually comes with some depression, so that might be the case with you as well. 

Take a step back and try and analyze possible causes. Have you been doing a lot of work? Try and pinpoint why you don't want to eat. I know that it's usually incredibly hard to do that since, based on what you said, you're not really sure why.

Try and eat something small if you realize you haven't eaten in a while. Don't force it down if you feel sick, but try and keep your body nurtured. Make sure to drink lots of water as well.

Anxiety sometimes makes you feel like an excessive amount of happiness must come with an exponential amount of bad. Power through. Stay strong. If this is your last day on earth, make it even better. Do everything you love. Hug your dog harder. Tell your loved ones how much you love them. Smile bigger. Play your favorite songs on repeat. Tell yourself that everything will be ok. Saying it out loud always seemed to help me. Smile at yourself in the mirror. Hug yourself.

Today isn't your last day. I promise. Take a deep breath. Let the tears out. You will be ok. Don't let your fear rule your day. Kick its butt and come out on the other side smiling. Show it that you're better than it.

I agree that pain is glorified on some shows. Some scenes in TV shows really grind my gears when they romanticize things like depression, anxiety, or suicide. 

The only thing I can say to you is that you are strong. Suffering is scary and no one should have to go through it. But you did. You've gotten through every single one of those experiences. I'm so proud of you because of that and you should try and be proud of yourself too. Remind yourself how strong you are and that you can get through things, because you will.

college,fi0myu5,t3_f5mghv,1582040599.0,"I was in the exact same position as you in introductory chemistry last semester. The teacher was annoying (she either went way too fast or way too slow; she was the ""we still have two minutes why are you packing up"" or ""you're not leaving until  \_\_% of you get this question right"") so I had very little drive to do the work. It was also my first semester of college and I was stressed, depressed, and was having problems with my roommate (I've since switched roommates).

I got a 30-something% on one of my exams after getting an 80-something% on the previous one. I was crushed. When I got a 60% on my next midterm, I got very worried that I'd have to retake the class. 

I've been told that introductory courses are sometimes structured to be ""filter-out"" courses (you don't care, you don't pass) and are hard for no reason. I worked my butt off when I was studying. Marked topics I didn't recognize/understand on the list of material, looked at past exams, watched course final videos on YouTube. But none of that did as much as it could have if I would have really tried to internalize the material and *really* learn it rather than just memorizing.

I'd say stick it out. The teacher seems awful and I'm very sorry you're having to deal with them. Do the very best you can and try and tell yourself that that's all you can ask of yourself. My sister (who's been accepted into the pharmacy school of a good university and has a lot of experience with my university's unapologetically awful chemistry department) has told me to go to the teacher. They can't fail you if they see you're trying. And if they do, they're an asshole who clearly doesn't understand how teaching works.

In the end, courses are sometimes curved to adjust pass-fail rate so that could be a possibility for you.

Best of luck. Hang in there. You should be very proud of yourself for going to see the teacher and a counselor. I'm rooting for you :)"

Ground yourself. Breathe. Do some meditation. 

I had a problem with my laptop for a while. It kept not charging if I moved the AC adapter even a tiny bit and I had to send it out to be repaired. Was supposed to get it back before I went to college, but that didn't happen. I had to use my sister's old, slow, very crappy laptop for over a month. Once I got it back, it wouldn't charge. I was so overwhelmed and was emotionally very shut down. After it all got sorted out, I took a day for myself. I did what I enjoyed and tried not to worry about anything else

Anxiety,fgbhgfg,t3_exqmau,1580662106.0,"If you're in a safe place (your room, for example), sit down. Breathe. Close your eyes if you need to. Deep breaths. 

Don't get me wrong, I'm scared of it too. I'm a very tall person (6') so I get really dizzy if I stand up...like...every time. My vision blurs. So I just close my eyes and lean on something. If I'm with someone, I hold up a finger to say ""hold on, this just happens, I should be ok"". 

Passing out is your body's response to a lack of oxygen or blood pressure changes. Your body's got your back. It's like ""oh crap, something's wrong. Here, let me reset that for you"". 

I'm not exactly sure what you're scared of (hurting yourself, having to deal with the aftermath, embarrassment), so if you'd be comfortable telling me, I could help talk you through it. I'm no psychologist, but I genuinely love helping people out and am a gigantic psych nerd.

Anxiety,fgbg4f2,t3_exqo2v,1580661763.0,"No, I don't think that's rude. I usually only say hi to people I've talked to several times.

If you're really worried about not seeming friendly, smile. If you catch their eye, smile at them. It always makes me happy when someone smiles at me, even if I barely know them. For me, a smile is a sort of acknowledgment that says ""Oh, you! I know you! I like you."" or ""Hello! Hope you're doing well!"" without actually saying anything.

Talk with those people more then start saying hi when you see them, even if it's just a small wave and a smile.

Anxiety,fgbf9d9,t3_exqo85,1580661464.0,"I'm sorry you had a bad experience with your last psychiatrist. You should be very proud of yourself for making another appointment in spite of that.

All I can recommend is just keep breathing. Tell yourself everything will be ok. You're working towards helping yourself and that's amazing! You're so strong for reaching out for more help.

There's always hope for a better tomorrow and I wish you the very best with your new psychiatrist. Keep an open mind and briefly consider what you'll say the first time. Try not to overthink it. The first appointment is always a bit awkward. I've had three therapists and a psychiatrist. Tell your psychiatrist what you've taking in the past, what you want for your future (less anxiety, treating problems impacting your everyday life, etc.), and what hasn't worked for you in the past. 

Be aware that going off of medication often causes withdrawl, so don't be surprised if your psychiatrist doesn't want you to stop taking your Zoloft. I've been taking Lexapro (10mg) for about two years and it does absolutely nothing. My liver is a beast and rips through low-dose medication. But, my psychiatrist said that as long as it isn't hurting me, it's better not to stop taking it.

Anxiety,ffiidi9,t3_ets0x3,1579974583.0,"Yes, yes, yes, one million times yes. I'm incredibly self-conscious about my appearance, especially considering I'm a six-foot-tall female with short hair, acne, and lots of skin discoloration. Some days, I don't want to leave the house because of how bad I look. It doesn't help that I have a serious case of baby-face and would probably look about 16 if I wasn't a giant.

But, I've been trying to fake my confidence lately. I'll straighten my back and ignore all the voices telling me I look bad. Sometimes, I'll talk back to them (in my head, of course) and tell them how stupid they are.

Wearing a denim jacket is bad-ass and there's nothing wrong with not liking what a lot of other girl like to wear. I don't like dresses, frills, flowers, skirts, or crop tops and feel most comfortable with myself in hoodies and jeans. Figure out what you like. Finding your personal style is an on-going process, but when you find that one thing that makes you feel attractive as hell, hold on to it.

You are a beautiful human. We're always way more critical of ourselves when it comes to our appearance and I promise you that you are not ugly. The only ugly people are the ones who judge you based on how you look. If people don't like you because you wear a top, jeans, and a denim jacket, then they just straight up suck. If you can't see yourself as beautiful, be beautiful on the inside. Being a kind person is way better than just being attractive, in my opinion.

I know how it feels to hate how you look. Trust me.

For a while, I wanted to cut my hair really short but was worried it would look ugly. Then, one day, I just said ""screw it"" and did it. And it looked good. And I love it. If there's something you want to try, try it! While the phrase is overused, we really do only live once and there's too little time to spend that life not loving ourselves. Smile at yourself in the mirror. Find features that you like, no matter how small. You are beautiful. Never forget that. On your bad days, hold your head higher. Don't let those bad thoughts get the best of you. Fight through. You can do this. Good luck, beautiful <3

Anxiety,ffigup0,t3_ets3m7,1579973555.0,"Politics suck. While I don't live where you live, I do live in the US and know at least a little bit about worrying about the outcomes of a big decision.

When Trump was elected, I was disappointed, angry, and petrified. It took me a while to even begin to accept it and, even now, I still don't see him as the leader of my country. When he launched his attack on Mexican immigrants, shut down the government, let Syria attack our Kurdish allies, and generally turned our country into the laughing stock of the world, I though America would suffer and that everything would go to shit. While there is a lot of tenseness between people here, we're still standing.

Things will change. It's inevitable, unfortunately. Some good things will go bad. But, at the end of the day, we get through it. Change comes with struggle and it seriously sucks, but have hope for a better tomorrow. I wish you the best of luck during the hard times over there in Europe."
Anxiety,ffiga98,t3_etslg4,1579973169.0,"It's so nice to see someone being concerned for their friend. As someone with anxiety, the best way to help us is to start out with doing the things he asks you to do. Then, eventually coax him into doing the things himself. 

For instance, if he's nervous about asking the waitress for something, give him your support and encouragement. Start out by asking for one thing yourself. Then, the next time he needs something, coax him into doing himself.

 Having someone accompany you to go do something when you have anxiety makes getting through it so much better. You doing all these things for him may not be helping him get over his anxiety, but it sure as hell is helping calm it.

The key is to attempt to ease him into doing it himself while also being firm if he continuously doesn't want to. 

You are a wonderful friend and I'm sure he appreciates your help more than he could ever express. Social anxiety is just something you have to ignore or fight through. It seems like you had some success with kicking it to the curb. Good job, by the way. That's a huge achievement and I'm very proud of you. Help him take away his anxiety's power over him and give him strength when he can't give himself any. It will take time and a lot of patience, but I'm sure it'll pay off in the end. Good luck :)"
Anxiety,ffifdfw,t3_ett7jq,1579972543.0,"I have definitely been through this. I shocked myself with a power strip a few months back and totally panicked. I ended up walking myself to the ER, got a EKG (checks your heart), and was told I was totally fine. 

I have a lot of health-related anxiety as well and am always so nervous when I get any pain in my head or my upper body. The way I've gotten through it is to try and try to rationalize the pain. Take some pain medication. Breathe. You're ok. Tell yourself that you are OK. I've found that staying anxious about pain makes it worse. The brain is an amazing, but awful thing and it can take your anxiety, use it to make you think the pain is getting worse, then cause even more anxiety. 

Mental distractions are psychologically proven  to relieve pain, so I suggest taking a deep breath, taking your tongue off the roof of your mouth, relaxing your shoulders and jaw, and go do something you love.

You are not pathetic. Your anxiety is valid and so are you. You'll get through this. I believe in you <3"

As long as you get the sleep you need, I don't think it matters how late you sleep. I'm so glad that you got some good sleep and that it felt good. Getting rest can really help one's emotional health.

I'm glad you can at least get a little bit of privacy and are able to cuddle your pillow to help you feel a little better. When I feel sad, I always just bury myself in my sheets and hug them and my pillow. Are there any people at school that you might be able to get closer to? It's hard to jump from being acquaintances to friends and it may take a little while to start talking with someone regularly, but I really hope you can find a friend that will hang out with you. Friends can really make life a whole lot more bearable when you're having trouble. I know it's hard to make friends, but I hope you're able to try reaching out to someone.

Oh no :( I'm sorry that almost happened. Did you hold it because you don't like going to the bathroom in public places? If so, it might be a good idea to try to tackle that anxiety. I don't know exactly why it makes you anxious (people looking at you, sanitation, etc.), but if you can pinpoint why you don't like it, I think you'll be able to figure it out :) 

Doritos are pretty good and I hope you like them. I don't think I've ever heard of Indian tonic, but it makes sense that it was disgusting lol. It doesn't sound like the most delicious thing in the world.

Hope you're getting some relaxation. It sounds like you're really emotionally exhausted and could use some. Best wishes <3"
Anxiety,fe3k9hr,t1_fe0ccbz,1578850050.0,"Good morning, friend!

I slept pretty well, thank you. I can never really say if I dreamt sweet dreams or not because my dreams always make no sense and I usually forget them soon after waking up because of how abstract they are. I stayed up a lot later than I intended because I was watching videos and trying not to laugh out loud because my roommate was sleeping. At one point, I made a noise and had to pass it off as a cough lol. Because of that I woke up at like 11, which is honestly what usually happens on weekends. I'm so glad you slept well! That's really great to hear! I hope you're able to sleep well again tonight. If you're really having trouble, melatonin really helped me when I had panic attacks during the night a few years back.

If your dad lets you close your door (I don't know how strict he is in that sense), close it and let it out. Let yourself be vulnerable. Hug a pillow if that helps.  It really sounds like you need affection, especially when it doesn't seem like you have a great relationship with your parents. I hope you can get a hug or cuddle someone real soon. When I'm at college, I don't get hugs at all. My mom came over here to drop off some things I forgot at home and I couldn't stop hugging her. I sincerely hope you can get a hug soon and I really wish I could just be there to talk with you in person and give you all the hugs I can give.

That's such bull that your dad gets pissed at everything. Just wondering, are you planning to go to university or are you planning on doing something else after primary school? It's perfectly fine if you have no idea. The only reason I never questioned whether or not I was going to college was because that was how I was raised.

That whole peeing the bed thing was honestly the worst part about being a kid lol. Going to the bathroom in a public place still kind of freaks me out.

I hope you're having a good day so far and that you're doing well. Hope you got those chips you were talking about. Junk food always makes me feel better :)"

Anxiety,fe05jr0,t1_fe00wiz,1578803581.0,"I definitely understand what you mean. I've been told I'm pretty good at detecting emotion as well. 

Sourcream and onion is pretty bomb. I was hesitant to try them at first (which was a while ago), but they're seriously good.

Overthinking does suck and it can really take its toll on your emotional health. If you need to cry, I really suggest finding a safe space and just letting it all out. Find a sad video online and just cry. I always feel so much better after having a good cry. It might help you as well. 

I'm sorry you don't have anyone to care for you and hug you and if I was with you I would 100% give you a huge hug. You deserve to be loved.

I guess I kind of miss my childhood in some aspects. Not worrying about anything. Not caring how I looked. Being able to act crazy and have fun without being seen as childish. It's weird looking back, though, because I realize where all my mental problems stemmed from. Bad experiences with my dad. The first time I had test anxiety. The first time I had stage fright. So I do miss it and sometimes I wish I could go back and enjoy a day in my childhood one more time and not have to worry about graduating college and getting a job. But I know that I'm a more grown-up person now and that I'm better than I used to be back then. 

Also, your dad getting on you about needing to go to the damn bathroom is dumb. What are you supposed to do, pee the bed? Don't listen to him if he gets mad at you about that. Seems like at that point he's just searching for things to tell at you about.

I'm going to go to bed now, but I hope we can keep this conversation going tomorrow. Hope you're able to get some rest :)"
Anxiety,fdzy8yl,t1_fdzxn90,1578798730.0,"That does sound like a living hell. I'm glad that you got out of there, but I'm sorry it hasn't gotten much better. 

I'm glad that you feel safe and thank you for your kind words. I did a lot of creative writing in middle and high school which kind of taught me to put my feelings down in writing, which really helps considering I'm not that great at actually articulating what I want to say when I'm speaking.

I don't think I've ever had the cheese and onion flavor. In fact, I don't think I've seen them in stores. Sounds pretty good, though. Hope you enjoy :)"
Anxiety,fdzwq0w,t1_fdzumjq,1578797642.0,"I'm sorry you're having trouble. 

Thank you for asking, but there honestly isn't much that's been bothering me. Ever since I left for college, my overall mood has gotten better since I don't have to mentally prepare myself for my dad knit-picking my every action or raising his voice at me (which always makes me cry). I mean, there's the daily anxiety, ADHD, and depression crap but I've just gotten used to it after having gone through so much therapy and after having lived with it for so long. 

Again, if you need to vent, I'm here. I'll talk to you or just listen to you and I don't need anything back. It brings me genuine happiness when I help someone feel better and, honestly, that's all I need :)"
Anxiety,fdzs79d,t1_fdzh1ne,1578794550.0,"This warmed my heart so much. Sending a virtual hug your way. 

Getting pushed down so often makes it hard to get up and I'm sorry that they're treating you that way. I'm very proud of you for trying so hard and you should be proud of yourself too. It's been a pleasure talking to you and I really, truly hope you can find peace soon. Never let their harsh words get to you. People usually act that way when they don't want to admit weakness or want to feel powerful. You accepting your feelings makes you powerful. A man who is open about emotions is infinitely stronger than any guy who tries to act hard and emotionless in my book."

college,fdzg901,t1_fdzfkff,1578789955.0,Thanks for the reassurance and for your kind words. There are some clubs that I could join and I've been considering doing that next school year since I'm kind of using freshman year to test the waters and see how I deal with things. Thank you again!
Anxiety,fdzfpfg,t1_fdzd7lp,1578789773.0,"Oh my god, I'm so sorry you went through that and I'm so glad that you're out of it now. 

It's definitely OK to feel weak. It's a very human emotion and no one should feel ashamed because they feel that way. Acknowledging your emotions and being comfortable with them is much more strong than ""growing some balls"" or trying to ""man up"". If anyone puts you down for showing your emotions, just know you are infinitely braver and stronger than people who think that way. 

You're definitely trying your hardest and that's amazing. If your body tells you that you need rest, listen to it even if it means doing nothing. I hope you can get some rest and enjoy some honey apple slices soon <3"

college,fdzb3nc,t3_en9a8e,1578788403.0,Goldfish and cashews. So good. GoGo Squeez is also the best thing ever. Portable applesauce that you don't need silverware for? Genius. Those portable Campbell's to-go tomato soups (the ones with sip caps) are also really nice.
Anxiety,fdz9q46,t1_fdz5k7c,1578788025.0,"I do know what you mean. It's hard to show the sensitive and weak side of yourself, especially when you're under fire from your dad. I really hope you can find someone that lets you be yourself and that hugs you and gives you everything because you deserve it. 

Going through something like you're going through isn't easy at all and when you have to try and push aside your emotions to try and stay strong in the face of all that anger even when it's painful makes it really hard to open up. If you can (I know talking to people is hard), try to meet some of those people at school. Join a club if your school does that kind of thing. Since it seems like your home environment consists of a lot of anger and stress on all sides, it would be good to have school be an escape to talk to friends. Again, I know making friends sucks as it doesn't always work out and involves a lot of social interaction. I have a lot of trouble with it, personally. But having at least one person who will listen, give you affection, and let you open up completely can really make all the difference. 

As for the food thing, (I'm going to sound like a total mom so stay with me) I would say trying to work in a fruit or vegetable can help you feel better about what you're eating if it makes you self-conscious. It could be carrot sticks or applesauce. It doesn't have to be a plate of broccoli or anything.

Don't let your parents get to you. I know it's hard when you're around them so much. If you can, do those things your dad always yells at you about before he yells. Don't let him have the satisfaction. At the same time, don't be too hard on yourself. You're doing the best you can and no one should ask any more of you. If you need to push yourself harder, let it be on your own terms. 

Stay strong <3"

Anxiety,fdz6sud,t3_enf9j0,1578787212.0,"Anxiety can absolutely cause simple auditory hallucinations. I get them every once and a while. You're not going crazy. Based on your comment about your sleep being poor lately, I think your body and mind are just tired.

I think the reason for it starting when you go into your room is that you're beginning to associate the room with the anxiety, which makes you fear feeling anxious again, which gives you anxiety. If you have some fear that stems from the sound of a doorbell (strangers, for example), it might be that you're feeling anxious for no reason (that's the GAD) and your mind is trying to find a reason for it so that it can anticipate what happens next (i.e. your mind imagines the doorbell ringing when it's anxious maybe so it can try and expect a person being at the front door and can plan for it). Anxiety does step from the fight or flight response, after all.  

While I'm in no way a professional psychologist with a lot of professional knowledge, I am a giant psychology nerd. Regardless, take the above suggestion with a grain of salt. 

If you need recommendations, I would maybe try meditating in your room. There is a great resource called Headspace (it's online and on the iTunes app store) that I would recommend checking out. What it seems like you should do is try and not associate your room with the anxiety. It will take work. Try deep breathing exercises and grounding exercises as well. You're going to be ok. You can fight through this. I believe in you <3"
