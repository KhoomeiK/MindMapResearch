I was extremely worried about the virus and dying. My husband and I updated our wills and talked to our 19 year old daughter about finances and raising her brother if something happened to us. I was all in with scrubbing down groceries and being angry at people I saw not ""socially distancing."" But then at some point I started to get angry. First at the media- I would see the headlines where even good news was spun as something bad like ""cases down in X but hospitals preparing for BIG SURGE"".  I subscribed to the WAPO online and I remember the day I deleted the app. One article was titled ""Coronavirus Could Wipe Out Human's Closest Relatives"", where they talked to scientists who said that there has been no known cases of primates getting the virus, no evidence that it could be spread to them, and no one knew how they might be infected. But hey, it COULD happen.  The other article was personal account of a pregnant woman and her nightmares about her baby getting Covid. Yes, her literal nightmares. No value whatsoever to that ""news"" other than to scare people.

And then I thought ""what is going on here?"" Why are the news media trying to manipulate and scare people like this?"" So I started seeking out positive news about the virus - real death rates, what groups were most affected (elderly and those with co-morbidities) and ended up here. Meanwhile the government's policies instead of loosening were becoming more and more draconian, the Constitution was being trampled on, the goal posts moved again and again, economy (i.e. actual people) being destroyed... And now I am no longer anxious about the virus, just really, really angry. 

So I get your friend. This is new for all of us and everyone deals with things differently. Even some doomers I know who are doubling down on their pro lockdown positions seem to be doing so out of fear. I did have to reel myself back at home - my 11 year old son in particular hates when I rant about the lockdowns. 

And I do agree that no one knows what will happen. Even the ""experts"" don't know. We are all just regular people with tons of information coming at us, all spun to fit one side or another.

I'm not entirely anti mask but only inside. There isn't any science, zero, to show the virus spreads outside by someone walking by. They all talk about virus clouds but provide no science.

Cloth masks aren't so good and people use them so poorly they might make you more likely to catch a virus.

While every virus is different and such incursions can be justified where scientifically sound, the public needs to know whether scientists — not politicians — are making these calls, whether there are no less-restrictive alternatives, and what provisions will be made available to those forced into quarantine. The more dangerous the actual outbreak, the more critical it becomes that we respond in ways that are grounded in science.

California already has a pretty bad public education system, the budget is being slashed and at least 1/3 of kids aren't even logging on for their pretty useless Zoom meetings. Can't imagine anyone pro-education thinking continuing this in fall would be a good idea.

Newsom is not very smart (I know people who know him personally and can't believe he made it this far) but seems easily influenced, which is good in this case. ""I'm not going to be influenced by protesters""... people protest... ""OK, we can start Phase 2 of reopening now.""

Gov Newsom last week allowed counties to begin to move into ""Phase 2"" (which really isn't much but it allows some curbside retail, manufacturing, etc.) The 6 Bay Area Counties have not done so. Newsom said counties can move slower on reopening, but can only move faster if some pretty strict criteria are met, like only one death in 14 days and 1 new case per 10,000 residents. (Some rural counties that have these numbers were already reopening.)

So today I went on the Zoom meeting of our county Board of Supervisors asking why we weren't moving to Phase 2? (I also sent emails). There was a report by a county health official stating that we need to meet the above numbers before we move forward in reopening! One supervisor questioned her (poorly) and later emailed me indicating that he understood that the strict criteria were only for counties reopening on an earlier timeline.

BUT THEN - I got an email from another Supervisor saying we can't reopen yet at all because we have had more than one death in 14 days. Which is NOT what the governor even said! THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS, ELECTED BY THE PEOPLE AND MAKING DECISIONS AFFECTING 1000S OF LIVES, DOES NOT UNDERSTAND THE GUIDELINES SET FORTH BY THE STATE! 

I sent him this article, because other Bay Area counties (which also don't meet these unattainable standards) are moving to phase 2 within days, and apparently this fool has not even spoken to his own county health officer.
