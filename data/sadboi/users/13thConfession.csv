hsp,fr5rtv9,t3_gmqmww,1589913596.0,"Thankful this was posted today. 

Just this morning, after a week of heightened anxiety, I began, for the first time, really considering medication. I've had generalized anxiety disorder my whole life and I'm nearing the tail end of a recovery from anorexia. 

Sometimes I don't know where each aspect of my brain chemistry begins and ends, if ya'll know what I mean. 

Like, is my anxiety super high because my hormones are all jacked up from the years of an eating disorder? Or is it just how my brain is. Is this how bad my anxiety has always been? Etc. 

Sometimes the simplicity of the idea of just taking medication to reduce all the head trips is very appealing - but being an HSP, it's likely not going to be simple at all....

I also make music and don't want to blunt myself creatively or emotionally. So, I guess we just tough it out for a lifetime and learn some serious healthy coping mechanisms? Lol. Yeesh...."

fuckeatingdisorders,fr1yk9l,t3_gm40rv,1589828120.0,"Glad to hear you’re in recovery. 

Everyone’s recovery experience will be different, but this particular phenomenon is more the norm than anything else. Your body wants energy, fast, and as much as possible, now that it knows food’s coming in. 

I actually had incredibly strong sugar cravings when I was still sick. A lot of what I ate was sugary, but of course due to the restriction of food in general, my body wasn’t getting what it needed and that’s why I craved it every day.

Sugar cravings were of course huge for me in early recovery, and I still feel like eating sugar every day, I just don’t feel the almost involuntary pull I used to. 

There’s an analogy that makes a lot of sense to me, with regard to this : if you held your breath underwater for a long time, until you felt like you were going to pass out, when you came up for air again, you’d take deep, heaving gulps of air. There’s no way you could ration that. Your body forces you to take in what it needs. After not that long of a time you’re getting enough oxygen again and your breathing rate returns to normal. 

Same with sleep. If you slept 3 hours a night for 7 days straight, you’d feel terrible, and when you DID sleep, you likely conk out for one of the longest sleeps of your life and wake up 14 hours later or something. In those instances, you wouldn’t judge yourself for needing the extra oxygen and sleep to restore. But with food, we have all these preconceived ideas of what’s good and bad, plus our engrained fear due to the disorder. 

The heightened cravings and huge appetite are going to diminish in time. It was hard for me to imagine when I was in it, but now most of the time my eating is pretty “normal”. I’m still at the tail end of recovery, though, so I do still experience ebbs and flows. 

Trust your body. It knows what’s up. You will be ok. Don’t be afraid. You aren’t a “normal” person in a “normal” situation. It’s not normal to be constantly thinking about food. That will change in time if you eat, and eat ENOUGH. You’re recovering from a life threatening eating disorder and your whole body/metabolism/brain situation is jacked the hell up. Let it heal. You’ll be so glad you did."

When I was young I just thought I was overly sensitive and sometimes even felt “stupid” as I often couldn’t control my emotional/stress response to situations, even if I knew it didn’t make logical sense. 

Acknowledging that it’s more of a chemical/nervous system thing rather than a personality flaw or intellectual shortcoming has really helped : )"

fuckeatingdisorders,fpll3kw,t3_gdy9sx,1588714658.0,"I'm sorry to hear you feel under the grip of the illness still, despite your efforts to eat. This sort of thing, and my own years long struggle with ED really highlights, for me, the importance of really going for it with eating and pushing your boundaries. I think clinically the understanding of weight restoration post anorexia is outdated. 

I always go back to the Minnesota Starvation Study. If those men had eaten a ""reasonable"" diet, enough to get healthier, but not quite enough to thrive and blast many of the physiological effects of the ED out of the water, I don't think they would've really fully recovered from their time of starvation. They didn't WANT to starve, so when they could eat again after the experiment, they ate is if there were no consequences (there aren't consequences, in reality) and they regained their full health. Granted these men didn't have the mental component for an eating disorder, but I do think re-wiring ED thoughts and behaviors coupled with eating WAY MORE THAN YOU THINK YOU NEED TO can erase much more of the ED from our brain than we think is possible. 

For example, If I'd stayed at the medically-sanctioned ""weight restored"" BMI, I'd be completely screwed mentally. I was still so in my disorder then, fearful of food, obsessive, still had so many ED symptoms. I've gained a good deal of weight since then, but not as much as I need, too, I think.

I truly think outcomes for anorexia would be different if we lived in a society where the idea of overshoot weight gain wasn't literally the worst possible thing that could happen to a person. It's so sad and awful and I resent so much that my thinking is subject to that. But I work every day to counteract those fallacies and I'm so much farther along that I ever thought I'd be. I refuse to give my whole life to this disease. 

I think if you're in a place where you feel you're walking a tight rope with your ED, you likely haven't gained enough weight. That's the issue with quasi, it leaves us so vulnerable to relapse and we never get to transcend the ED. We can live a ""normal"" life, with the threat of the illness always ready to strike. 

Even if it's just a week, or something, why not try eating more than you feel comfortable with? Or foods you're uncomfortable with? It's been 15 years, what do you have to lose? I know the fear is overwhelming, but, it could yield some very interesting results. 

Good luck to you : )"
Anxiety,fpj87a0,t3_gdn6bd,1588659538.0,"Yes, this is definitely happening for me over the last ...10 days? At first I blamed it on PMS but it’s lasted too long and it’s getting worse. It always comes and goes with me, but this particular phase of anxiety feels more like a slowly approaching panic, if that makes sense. It’s odd in that it’ll creep up on me, sometimes. 

For instance the other day I was sitting on the couch reading, feeling relatively normal. My boyfriend put on some upbeat music and immediately I felt my anxiety skyrocket. The sound felt jagged and threatening. It was alarming because the experience seemed to imply that I was very on edge and just hadn’t fully noticed it until there was an outside stressor. 

But since then it’s been more noticeable. It’s bad today. Just trying to take some deep breaths and focus on something as beat I can."

fuckeatingdisorders,fp2umuv,t3_gay5se,1588268164.0,"Hi, there. Yes, everything you're describing is classic ED fear-based response and thought processes. Feeling paralyzed. Feeling that if you DID let go and start eating you'd never stop.

Totally sympathize with you, it's hard as hell.

Essentially, the answer to all your questions above is, ""Yes, do the thing you need to do.""

The simple fact of the matter is that where your body's at right now.....there's no skipping over point B to get to point C, if you feel what I mean. You're right in that following a rigid meal plan with too few calories would be awful. But it's also scary to imagine eating with no parameters after you've been keeping such close track of everything.

I'm not trying to doubt your judgement, you know your body, but, it is true that sometimes people confuse ""binging"" with the extreme hunger that comes from allowing oneself to eat again in anorexia. Your body is biologically driven to consume lots and lots of calories as a response to deprivation, and there's no real way to avoid this part of it.

Sounds like the big issue here is purging. If you purge after letting yourself eat, it's starting the whole cycle again. If you can avoid purging, which I understand is very hard, you can nourish your body and try to get to a place where you feel less out of control around food, and eventually, calm around food.

Basically, you're terrified of weight gain, terrified of ""having eaten too much""....there's just no way around feeling these things in recovery. Maybe you can try for one week, at least, to follow your hunger and not purge? Make it a goal?

There also may be people around you who don't know about the physiological side of eating disorders who will discourage eating whatever, whenever. Ignore them, they don't get it.

You can do this. What feels impossible isn't impossible. Sitting with the discomfort of not purging was one of the hardest things I've ever had to do, but now I don't have to worry about it anymore. I'm on the other side! It's possible!

Please consider being kind to yourself. You're not bad or wrong for needing to eat. Your body is desperate. Don't moralize this. It's purely biological.

If you need support I highly recommend Tabitha Farrar's YouTube videos and blog. She has videos on pretty much every subject related to all eating disorders. <3

fuckeatingdisorders,fovrpos,t3_g9uter,1588106371.0,"Hunger cues get completely thrown out of whack in anorexia, and remain so in recovery, often. There are theories as to why this happens, but basically, it is completely normal.

The short answer is, you have to force yourself to eat 3 meals and 3 snacks MINIMUM a day. You can't just sit around waiting for your hunger cues to return because, let me tell you, I've been in recovery for a good long while and my hunger cues are still not reliable. In the morning I don't really feel hungry but I eat breakfast first thing. Making sure I eat regularly and ENOUGH food throughout the day, like a ""normal"" person does, is the only reason I feel stable and am staying healthy.

Hunger cues do return eventually, but don't be worried about it. If you're thinking about food all the time, that's a sign that your body wants food. People who have never suffered an eating disorder don't sit around thinking about food all day. It's happening because your body needs food.

&#x200B;

You may find that you don't feel hunger after not eating for awhile, but you might feel fatigued, nauseous, irritable, sad, anxious, dizzy, weak. These are all signs for me that I need to eat, though I try to avoid ever letting my body get to that place. Better to just stay on track and not wait around to be absolutely convinced that I need to eat because I feel SO bad.

Also the more regularly you eat, the better chance you have of getting your metabolism back on track in a shorter time period, which makes all of recovery so much easier.

Check out Tabitha Farrar on YouTube or her blog on her website. She has posts and videos on every subject having to do with EDs.

fuckeatingdisorders,fovqqo1,t3_g9rjj8,1588105892.0,"Agreed with the commenters here, getting professional help is great. It isn't an option for all of us, though, and if that's the case, it's important you know it's possible to recover without getting an official diagnosis or seeing a therapist. But IT IS best to reach out for help if it's an option for you. 

Usually when your body is starving, it's easy to put on weight quickly. And as others have said, some of this, especially in the first few weeks, will be water weight. Your body is designed to prioritize weight gain once you begin eating again after a ""famine"", which is what your body perceives has happened. 

It's also really important to remember that at your age, your body is still growing! And your brain hasn't even finished developing yet! Your brain doesn't finish developing until your 25. (With long term restriction/starvation, your brain SHRINKS. Your heart, too). 

These are extremely important years for your body. I know gaining weight may seem like the end of the world right now, but you have to weigh the pros and cons. Do you want a functional body and brain for the rest of your life, or do you want to adhere to societal standards for your body until......who knows.....you have to be hospitalized? Or maybe you'll just yo-yo for the next 3 decades, putting your body through absolute hell, not to mention not being able to have a normal life. 

It's so tricky. And it's hard, I won't lie, but it's totally within your power to beat this. Unfortunately eating disorders are often painted as an illness that you can only kind of recover from, but that's not true! The problem is a lot of the time people who try to recover just don't gain enough weight, and they get stuck in some sort of quasi-recovery, which often leads to relapse. 

If you need more resources, I would check out Tabitha Farrar's website and YouTube videos. She's amazing and encouraging and completely recovered herself. She has videos and blogs on every possible subject related to eating disorders. 

You can do it! Don't let anyone tell you you're gaining weight too fast/eating too much. 

Even people who are in positions where they're supposed to help you (dietitians/doctors) have often been conditioned by our society to see thinness as the most important thing. 

Good luck! You can totally do this!"

fuckeatingdisorders,fouwt8o,t3_g9ohof,1588091693.0,"I think the folks in the comments have it right. I've been in recovery for quite a long while now and I STILL can't rely on hunger cues. The times I've tried to wait until I feel actual hunger don't work out well. Usually just winds up with my feeling hungry but also nauseous and I get a bad headache, become irritable, etc. (Edit: This isn't to say I never feel hunger, I definitely do, it just isn't around at every meal time etc)

You just have to remember that in recovery from an ED your body isn't behaving like other people's. It's in survival mode and unfortunately we can't choose how long it will take to heal.

&#x200B;

I always say go back to the Minnesota Starvation Study. The men in the study were systematically starved for 6 months and when they were allowed to eat whatever they wanted again, it took some of them up to a year to feel that their relationship with food resembled something normal. And they had to eat a LOT. Depriving our bodies of what they need to thrive does serious damage. And it requires serious recovery time.

Due to our societal conditioning a constant hunger and any weight gain is perceived as bad bad bad but it's just your body protecting itself and healing. It's the same thing as a bone mending in a cast. No one judges that. It takes a long time and is super inconvenient but we understand that there's no alternative .

Let your body heal, TRUST your body. ""Normal"" people don't have persistent mental hunger every day, that's a reflection of that fact that your body is in deficit and healing.

Good luck! You can do it! And congrats on getting as far as you have."

fuckeatingdisorders,for74gj,t3_g8z2ag,1588007303.0,"I think a lot of people are feeling what you are. I already worked from home, so it hasn't been as much of a shock, but the lack of daily activity definitely has been hard to cope with at times.

There are days when I've had to wear a sweater, too. I also live in LA where we're suffering a heat wave and it's been impossible to wear heavy clothing last few days so I've been whipping out the baggy t-shirts and shorts.

One thing I always try to remind myself when I'm feeling wobbly and that I just ""can't endure it"" a second longer is that:

1.) It might seem intolerable, but it IS possible to not give in to ED behaviors. It's my decision to backslide. I can't say it was because everything was just too much.

2.) I tell myself if I gave into ED behaviors, I'd be undoing so much hard work AND I'd inevitably have to dig myself out of the relapse and it'll be that much more difficult/annoying/uncomfortable than if I'd just stayed on course. I'm trying to heal my metabolism from years of damage and relapsing is just another set back. It's a no win situation.

3.) It's NEVER just using one behavior. It ALWAYS snowballs,....at least in my experience with relapses in the past.

As far as tips to help ignore the discomfort, I think you gotta just do whatever you can! Make sure you feel comfortable in the clothes you're wearing. That's a HUGE trigger for ED thoughts for me.

If you start getting tunnel-vision on one thing, something I've tried to do is just think about absolutely anything else. Even if it feels weird. Try to change your train of thought. Even if it's just 5 minutes. Read an article, watch a funny video, braid your hair, text a friend, do a fun questionnaire online. This is something I do for myself when I struggle with intrusive thoughts with OCD. I just say, ""nope, not going there"" and think of something else. It can be challenging, but it's possible.

There's something that ED recovery coach Tabitha Farrar says which is basically, ""you can't prevent thoughts from popping up, but you can choose to not indulge them"". It may feel out of your control, but, it isn't!

I've heard that meditation can be extremely helpful when you're struggling but I'm still lazy with that.

Anyway, these are just some ideas. Not sure if they'll be helpful. I know how hard it is to deal with the constant badgering of your mind! You gotta start teaching your brain that those negative thoughts aren't a priority. One way to do that is to try to just move on from the thought as soon as it pops up.

It's one of those things that feels ""impossible"", but eating more probably felt impossible prior to recovery, and we manage that. The brain is so adaptable. It takes a LOT of hard work but things can improve. <3"

Advice,foks0xp,t3_ev5mkb,1587847838.0,"Hi! 

I too have OCD, anxiety and suffer from restless leg. In my instance, I've been recovering from Anorexia for years, really. I'm probably in what is referred to as ""quasi-recovery"". I have gained a decent amount of weight, but not quite enough to fully get out my body out of the scarcity mentality zone. 

I think the first thing that's important to acknowledge with RLS is that we still don't know exactly why it occurs. I've seen a number of threads which mention RLS on Reddit (and other forums on the internet): fitness people, eating disorder recovery people, people trying to come off of various medications but can't because RLS is a symptom of withdrawal. 

I see a lot of people making blanket statements about how to cure it, but we have to remember it's anecdotal. 

I know there are theories that it involves magnesium, iron, dopamine, other things....

In my case I notice it when I exercise harder than normal (or at all, sometimes) and when I increase or decrease the amount of calories I'm taking in. There are times when I feel l like I have it, mildly, pretty much every night, but it gets REALLY bad when I make big changes to the amount I eat or exercise. The exception seems to be when I eat a HUGE meal with lots of fat in the evening, like going out for a big dinner. That seems to put me to sleep, sometimes. But say if I up my calories in a day but by a more moderate amount.....to me it feels like I've triggered something in my body or brain and my body wants more of it. Like it didn't get enough. Often when I just can't sleep due to RLS I'll wake up and eat something and it will help, but it's hard to want to eat a lot in the middle of the night, obviously. 

Anyway, this is just my experience. I'm still confused by it and I hope we learn more about this affliction down the road. Sorry to hear you're suffering from it. 

The dopamine connection with OCD, anxiety, eating disorders and RLS is very curious to me.....I intend to learn more. 

Good luck with everything!"

I know in the past I've certainly acted in disordered ways because I saw what someone else was eating, that applies to people in recovery and people without food issues, too. 

I worry, too, since when people first start recovery, often what they think is ""a lot"" of food, or calories, really isn't! Imagine seeing someone posting something like, ""going for it today!"" and it's like, a vanilla yogurt, or something.....lol. Meanwhile you've got a stack of pancakes in front of you. IDK!

fuckeatingdisorders,fkkv2sx,t1_fkibrq0,1584292556.0,"Hi. Apologies if my post seemed insensitive. I was sick for many years. I didn't meant to suggest that your safe foods were luxury items. It doesn't matter what they are. I know these are hard times, and working in the midst of this is extremely difficult. There's never a good time to break ED habits. I'm glad you've taken the initial steps and I'm sorry the world is so crazy at the moment. I know EDs are complex and we often feel powerless, but at the end of the day, it IS possible to force yourself to eat more, and to eat varied kinds of foods. YES it's normal to be afraid, that's why people die from this disease. YES it IS in your control to change things, though it may not feel like it. If we think of all the people who have recovered from EDs, they weren't force-fed. Maybe they were brought into inpatient unwillingly, but eventually they had to make the decision to end the cycle. 

I didn't mean to come off as insensitive, I just try to be a voice of reason in this community because every day I see tons of posts where people are talking about the ED like they have zero control over it. It may be one of the most difficult things in you life to overcome, but believing that it is not within your control to change your behavior is extremely dangerous. 

I know this is also a community for commiserating, but sometimes it feels a bit like a pro-ana site. And maybe I'm in the wrong place.

Maybe we can take this time to recognize how lucky we are to even be privileged enough to only eat ""safe"" foods.

fuckeatingdisorders,fkccx0j,t3_fhd1ki,1584050442.0,"I grew up poor and there were definitely serious financial worries that sometimes impacted my feelings about food, but, I think it's also important not to over-psychologize certain aspects of ED. Preoccupation with food is not just a symptom of having an ED but also just of people who're malnourished in general.

In the Minnesota Starvation Study, all the subjects of the study, healthy men, starved over time, developed weird hoarding/eating rituals and thought about food constantly. Some would try to stretch out meals for as long as they could. I guarantee if you gained weight and ate considerably more this fear would lessen.

When I was very ill I was super protective of my food. I'd hide food from my boyfriend, resent anyone who ate my food etc. I would also save food scraps from places. Or whatever little bits of food I could. I felt totally ashamed of it but I understand what drove me to act that way: my brain and body thought I was starving (which I was) and was trying to keep me alive. I wasn't trying to ""fill a hole"" or soothe a childhood fear. Maybe that was part of how the illness began, but years into my ED, I think all of my behaviors stemmed from starvation and the scarcity mindset that comes along with that."
EatingDisorders,fka2uri,t3_fh35qu,1583990570.0,"Lots of good replies here. I’d say first off it sounds like you’re seriously restricting. The only way to fix your metabolism is by returning to “normal” eating, which probably means eating more than a lot of people. You can’t trick your body or metabolism. It knows if you’re restricting. Your body wants sugar because it’s the easiest thing to process for instant energy. 

I don’t believe, as suggested in the comments, that eating sugar causes you to want to eat more sugar in this particular case; someone who’s still restricting heavily. It’s incredibly common to crave sugar with a restrictive ED, and early in recovery. Your body is desperate for food and energy. Ya gotta eat, A LOT! No way around it. 

Eat or stay ill with a permanently out of whack metabolism that will want to gain on very little food, a life-saving mechanism!"

fuckeatingdisorders,fjoo7sv,t3_feiz96,1583531676.0,"It's really normal to feel like absolute shit in the beginning of recovery. 

When you're deep in ED, due to the fact that you're not consuming enough to fuel your body beyond it's more basic functions, your body begins to break down it's own lean tissue/muscle as sustenance,  (that includes your heart and brain!) and also pumps out cortisol, the stress hormone, to keep you going. This is NOT good long term, but it's what your body does to survive. It can result in feeling more immune to pain. Like people that somehow go running when they're incredibly ill and already have injuries from compulsive exercise. This doesn't last forever and if you stay sick long enough your immune system will become compromised and there are endless complications that are guaranteed to arise. 

&#x200B;

It's also maybe why a lot of people say they rarely get sick when they're in their ED. The first thing that happened to me when I started recovery was I got a bad cold. Your body is letting down it's defenses now that nutrition is coming in. It can now take the energy it was using to keep you in crisis/survival mode and put it toward repairing the huge list of things that've been damaged in your ED. 

If you've ever been in a car accident, you know that when your body is pumped full of adrenaline and stress, you don't feel too much. But the next day you feel like you were.....in a car wreck. 

So when you start eating more food for long enough your body is going into convalescing mode. It doesn't want you running around and wasting energy. It wants you to rest and eat and repair. 

The bloating is natural, of course, and will improve if you just keep eating. It's hard and sucks but will pass eventually. 

I think people fail to realize just how much damage has been done to their bodies in ED because we don't always see it with our eyes or in blood work. But it attacks every part of you! And that takes time to fix. 

Please keep eating and resting! It's hard but there's no alternative!"
fuckeatingdisorders,fjoltpk,t3_fej0yr,1583530354.0,"Boy -- I understand that exhaustion. The restriction to purge and back again is physically and mentally so so devastating. It's so hard on your body : ( 

Have you reached out for help to anyone around you? I know families aren't always reliable for this, but if there's anyone close to you that you think could help, can you turn to them? 

Not sure what your financial situation is, but therapy can really help. I'm in a place where I can only really afford it in times of desperate need, so I get it if it's not an option. 

I know that it feels like there'll never be anything you can do to stop restricting or purging - like it has to be one or the other, or both at the same time, but it IS possible. It's hard as hell, I'm not gunna lie, but it is possible to stop restricting. Eating a lot in response to restriction is a perfectly natural biological function. When you're coming from a place of such extremes with your relationship to eating and your body, it's going to take a lot of time and effort to confront. 

I used to think I literally wasn't capable of eating a normal amount of food, and that there was zero chance I could ever gain weight and deal with it. I spent years thinking that. Then, like you, I was exhausted enough that I just said fuck it and did the hard work. Plenty of slip ups, but the road evened out over time. Now I'm in a place of health I NEVER thought I'd be. 

What resources do you have at your disposal to help yourself? 

Let us know how you're doing."
fuckeatingdisorders,fjo2rhz,t3_fehjs3,1583519342.0,"I'm sorry to hear that you had a slip up. It doesn't have to be the end of the world! 

Brief lapses into old behavior are totally expected in recovery. It's just very likely to happen. You can turn things around. I know it's hard to deal with the shame and regret, but it's truly okay. You're not a failure. You're amazing for making it all those days! Don't convince yourself you've ""thrown it all away"". Black and white thinking is one of the first things you have to overcome in ED recovery. It isn't that simple. 

JUST BE NICE to yourself. Don't self-punish, that only reinforces the cycle.

Also, PLEASE, don't weigh yourself, lol. The second you step on that thing you're just asking for a relapse. Maybe down the line you can work on being okay with weighing yourself, but I think for MOST of us it's VERY tricky and needs to be avoided at all costs. It's just not worth it. 

You can do it! Don't despair. You'll be okay."

fuckeatingdisorders,fjmhykm,t3_fe5dhd,1583471097.0,"With longterm Anorexia there is loss of grey matter in the brain, but the studies show that with full recovery things return almost to pre-ED state. You could google brain atrophy in anorexia. I don't think it's something that happens super quickly, so if you're ED hasn't been longterm, maybe it's not something to worry about as much. But it also depends on the severity of your restriction. 

Also, if you say you were severely restricting for the above mentioned timeframe , that's pretty lengthy -- long enough to require more than a few weeks of recovery. Brain fog is ALSO something that comes with recovery. It makes sense, I guess. Your body is allotting all it's energy to repairing shit. So, it stands to reason the more you eat the more your body will have to work with for repairs. 

There's a Psychology Today blog written by an academic named Emily Troscianko. She's charted her recovery from severe long term anorexia in many insightful and thought-provoking entries. She's never mentioned feeling half-cocked with her mental agility now that she's recovered, if it means anything. 

I DEFINITELY feel like the more calorically dense and rich in fat the things that I eat are the sharper I feel mentally. Make sure you're eating enough saturated fat! I'm sure you'll be okay but I understand why it seems worrying! 

Good luck and let us know how you're doing : )"

Also, my husband. We have an intense bond and even times where I've slipped up for a few days, the energy between us changes and he can always feel it.

When I'm eating to full health our time together is so fun, which is the vast majority of the time. We laugh a ton and have deep discussions about life. My slip ups are getting rarer and rarer and it's so nice to feel happy and comfortable all the time.

Also, maybe TMI but my sex drive absolutely tanks when I eat less and it makes me feel really depressed, because it puts distance between us.

I also feel like I've used up a lot of years being stuck in my own struggle and it's time I cared about someone else's problems for a change. It's not as easy to help those around you if you're a mess yourself.

Thanks for the question!"
fuckeatingdisorders,fjllylw,t1_fjko9jg,1583449263.0,"This makes sense, and I totally get it! I think it's important to try to ween off it in time, though, just so you don't have to rely on it. And just so it doesn't turn into a compulsion, like things so easily can with people who suffer from ED. It's good that you're trying to make sure you eat enough, though."
fuckeatingdisorders,fjllrv4,t1_fjl6ipq,1583449148.0,"Well, first off I'd say if you were feeling a lot of aches and pains in the beginning of recovery, that's a sign that your body was pretty messed up. 10 months seems like a long time, but it takes a long long time for the body to properly heal. 

For instance, I've heard about a person's hair not growing in until a year into recovery. The system-wide damage inflicted by eating disorders is huge, but I understand it can be frustrating to wait it out. 

I can totally relate to your ""well, if I'm gunna feel like shit I might as well be sick"" logic, but it's easy to see the ED through rose-colored glasses after it's been awhile, you know? 

Bodies are amazing, so adaptive. I definitely feel like I'm close to being fully recovered, but I could be eating even more than I do now and that is what has held me back from fully 1000% thriving. But in general, I don't have aches and pains anymore, no headaches, I'm not irritable all the time, I can stay up late without feeling like I'm dying, I don't get bloated like I used to! It used to be SO bad. If I do feel bloated, it passes after a couple of hours instead of feeling like I can't move for the rest of the night, etc. 

Surely there must be some improvements in your health in this time? Try to focus on those. Ugh, it requires so much patience. People who recover from EDs deserve a friggin medal of honor. 

Stick with it! You've made it 10 months, that's amazing! Truly impressive stuff."
fuckeatingdisorders,fjlj9xq,t3_fe28ty,1583447645.0,"I think it's very common. And generally I think your body is looking for very calorically dense stuff, with fat! Remember, your requirements for energy from food is so much higher than a normal person!"

EatingDisorders,fjl2ef3,t3_fdvwiz,1583438600.0,"Things do get better eventually. Therapists help but they aren't always perfect. It depends on how much they know about eating disorders. For instance, the therapist I saw was a really great person and offered a lot of insight, but didn't really know anything about the physiological effects of EDs. That's a BIG problem! Fortunately I had done a ton of research and could fill in the blanks, but, it can get tricky when someone who's helping you wants to blame ED recovery symptoms on psychology.

&#x200B;

That being said, the fact that you've gotten to the point where you've embraced periods of weight gain and have sat through discomfort is all you need to know! You're capable of recovery. You're wise to want to figure out a way to ensure longterm success. The exhaustion that comes from overriding ED thoughts and behaviors every day is truly profound. But the longer you do it, the easier it gets. It's important to make sure you move out of quasi-recovery before you can count on substantial mental state changes, though. If you just gain a little weight and keep it there intentionally because you think you're ""mostly healthy"", you're not gunna fully recover.

There are SO many resources on the internet for recovering on your own, if it isn't possible to get an ED treatment team. I recovered without one. I also get a little paranoid because I've heard so many stories about dietitians/therapists/doctors being fat-phobic and inadvertently handing out triggering info. So, proceed with caution and remember that even if someone holds a position of authority in your mind, it doesn't mean that can't be wrong or misinformed.

And yeah, you nailed it, you want to keep the ED alive, at least a little, so you have permission to eat. Because once you feel you've gained a certain amount you don't feel justified anymore.

This line of thinking keeps people sick for years and years and years.

I've definitely been here before. But eventually you have to make a choice to accept the weight gain and learn how to feel justified in eating.

I neverrrrr thought I'd be where I am today, but I kept at it for years and now I feel like I'm not too far off from being fully recovered.

Don't let anyone tell you that you can never recover fully. I think the longer you work at it, (and depending how hard you work at it), life can feel pretty normal again! Maybe you'll always be sensitive to certain issues, but I KNOW FOR A FACT the tortuous ED thoughts can be eliminated if you work for it.

Seems like it's a big belief in this community that at best you can halfway recover and be mentally buried in ED thoughts for the rest of your life. It isn't true.

I promise you can get to a point where you're recovered and can still enjoy eating! But right now you're stuck in the ED mindset really hard. You've got to do the work to get out."

Maybe you're young so the idea of a decrepit body and thrashed immune system can seem romantically tragic, but the fact is, it's just dangerous. 

One of the best things you can do is COMPLETELY eliminate exposure to competitive ED mentality. If you're following people who are deep in their disorder on various forums on the internet or social media, stop that shit right now. 

If you know you're susceptible, you have to make it easier on yourself. 

""I don't know what else I can do to stop gaining""......what does this mean within a post in a subreddit titled ""fuck eating disorders""? Are you actively trying to lose weight? What is it that you want from this community? I understand needing reassurance or someone to talk to, but are you maybe also looking for someone to tell you this behavior is bad for you? Because if that's what you're looking for: IT'S BAD FOR YOU! 

You can't fight your biology. Things sound pretty desperate from your description and it doesn't have to be this way. Are you worried that because your ""only slightly underweight"" your struggle is going to be invalidated? Sometimes doctors, psychologists and dietitians can really suck when it comes to eating disorders. I can't blame you for being nervous but, you have to advocate for yourself. 

Anyone who's recovered from an ED has had to willingly override their desire to purge and restrict. It's possible no matter how hopeless a case you think you are. 

I can't really tell from your post if recovery is something you're interested in. I really hope it is because it's the only path forward that makes sense!

It's not a maybe. If you stop eating regularly you WILL slip back into the ED. So take the opposite action.

fuckeatingdisorders,fjfxgdv,t3_fd8at9,1583303257.0,"I feel you. I've been in a similar headspace before. I think I've learned, after many, many, maaaany relapses and various stretches of existing in quasi recovery, that you either want to recover or you don't. No one's going to force you and the outside world isn't going to get softer.

It's kind of like drug addicts, you know? You can throw them in rehab a dozen times and until they're finally just done with doing drugs, they always go back to it. And it's usually because life gets hard, or the temptation in a certain moment was too much.

How do you get to a place where you genuinely want to be fully recovered? I don't know. Sometimes I think you have to take what momentum you might have and run with it. When you have no coping mechanism to replace everything you've used to get by, life can feel unbearable.

It sounds like you have a lot of insight into your condition, which is worth its weight in gold. You don't sound like you're in denial, maybe you just feel defeated and resigned because you can't escape the ED thoughts and desires.

When I feel like I'm getting a lot of thoughts and am teetering on the edge, I just jump for any kind of distraction I can. Go do something, talk to a friend, any friend, read a book, start a project, watch a movie, do 10 things at once if you have to, just try to break the thought cycle.

I really relate to the ""why can't I just function?"" question. Why do I have to be so sensitive to everything? It's just how we are. We have to figure out ways to cope with life without killing ourselves. Living the tired/grey zone life is so so awful. It's just really not worth it.

It's much much worse than the discomfort of getting used to weight gain and feeling open and receptive again, painful as that can be. I shudder when I think of my numbest days. It truly feels like being half dead.

I'm wishing you luck and strength. You ARE capable of getting through it. It's hard not to feel doomed sometimes. You have to fight like hell, but's possible to get past this!

EatingDisorders,fjfnl1r,t3_fd3sdj,1583295606.0,"Tabitha Farrar published an E-book specifically about neural re-wiring, which I believe is necessary for full mental recovery. It's available on Amazon and it's like 4 dollars. I'd recommend ALL her other books as well, she changed my life. She also has a YouTube channel which is a treasure trove of recovery material.

To me, trying to overcome the mental part of ED is not that different from dealing with co-morbid OCD with anorexia. In a lot of cases, the OCD doesn't develop until someone is years into the illness, that's what happened to me. I've been facing fear foods, gaining weight, really really trying to rewire my thoughts around food and body image. Things have really changed so much!

But the OCD? It expresses itself in a few different ways and because I'm so distracted with maintaining my recovery from ED, it's hard to do the hardcore work with the OCD.

For instance, I check to make sure the stove is off a lot. When I get stressed out, it gets worse. I have to check it before I leave the house, and before I go to bed. Always multiple times. Sometimes I even have to get out of bed to go check it again, when I don't want to.

BUT.

I travel for work a lot. Sometimes I'm gone for a month or so. When I come home, there's always at least one day where it doesn't occur to me to check the oven. Because I've been gone so long, it's like the information is de-prioritized in my brain and it forgets I used to care about it. Then I remember and I slowly slip back into checking the oven again.

So, my point here is, obviously we have to think about food and our bodies every single day. It's impossible not to. So those neural pathways are getting worn in over and over forever. We don't have a chance to not think about it. So you have to actively do things to contradict your ED mindset, to show your brain the worry/fear isn't warranted.

You can be eating SO MUCH and GAIN WEIGHT, but if you still really think that it's bad/dangerous/unhealthy to do so, you're not going to rewire anything. You have to try to reframe things to get over the fear. It takes a long time but it's totally possible. Question your beliefs about how bodies should look, try to understand how irrational your fear of food is. Brains are neuroplastic. With time and effort, we can change certain things. The automatic fear response to food and weight gain can be overcome.

I also think a certain level of weight gain must be attained before your brain can work well enough to work on rewiring. Even if you've gained weight before and then lost it.

Sorry so long! I believe full recovery is 100% possible. There are people who have done it, and those people were horribly horribly ill before. I think it's only possible by committing to feeling very uncomfortable for a long time and refusing to give in to the urge to act out behaviors or lose weight. Full recovery isn't NEARLY as common as quasi-recovery for very obvious reasons. Don't let anyone tell you it isn't possible.

Sorry so long! Good luck!"

EatingDisorders,fjeoovh,t3_fcstye,1583275683.0,"Great advice in the comments, as usual.

I'm sorry you're going through this. It is really, truly difficult.

One thing I try to remind myself is that, no matter how you spin it, you will not be able to sustain an eating disorder forever. Sooner or later, you'll either shift to a different eating disorder, die from the eating disorder or recover.

What happens to most people I think is, a certain level of desperation is reached and recovery is sought out. You start gaining weight, freak out and run back to restricting or purging, or whatever your behavior(s) are. Living this way is hellish, especially after experiencing a period of nourishment and rest, so you go back to trying to gain weight and recover. Gain weight, freak out, backslide etc etc. Some people, I feel like the majority of people, get stuck in this loop for years and years and years.

I think what finally pushes a lot of people to break the cycle permanently and finally gain the real weight is just utter exhaustion. Like, they just can't care anymore. I think life really opens up to people when they truly recover and they realize the world doesn't end. They often wish they'd recovered fully years ago!

Recovering fully from an eating disorder is one of the hardest things a person can do. There is SO MUCH stacked against you. And honestly I don't think there's enough accessible support for most people who suffer from them.

I don't know, I can't say I haven't gone up and down one thousand times in my journey, but I've finally accepted that it's just not worth it anymore. I don't want to wake up one day and realize my entire life has passed me by. And honestly? Your WORST fears about a recovery outcome are probably totally exaggerated and fueled by the ED. IT CAN BE OKAY. YOU CAN BE OKAY.

Imagine if you got diagnosed with cancer. Would you still try to lose weight? Or keep yourself at a lower weight? You'd probably focus on the things that matter, like your friends and family and passions.

Eating disorders are as destructive as cancer, they're just much much slower and you can live with the illusion that you're okay.

I do think that maybe in recovery there are periods of mental overwhelm or sensitivity, brain fog also, but, one thing I can't ignore is that on days where I eat a lot more than I normally would, like a holiday, or a big dinner out, or something, I feel sharpened mentally and feel momentarily like my old self. 

&#x200B;

I guess when it comes down to it I don't really have any doubt that the mental sluggishness/resistance stems from energy deficit and resulting chemical/hormonal imbalances. 

The only thing stopping me from going all in is, of course, fear of weight gain. I've made a lot of progress, but it isn't enough. I no longer feel like I'm in a place where I'm afraid I'll want to lost weight, but being in the quasi zone isn't great either. I plan to up these calories. What other option is there?

Personally I don't think there's really any way starting up a gym routine could be healthy in this scenario. It's bound to be serving your ED? And also, just not really safe! Any form of rigorous exercise (enough to develop muscle) is going to put a lot of pressure on your heart.

Also, it generally is just switching one compulsion out for another. At least in my experience, I've learned the hard way many times. What happens if you can't go to the gym for awhile for some reason? Will you start eating less?

Can you not try to gain some weight first before trying? It just sounds dangerous to me.

&#x200B;

Wish you the best of luck. Not trying to sound discouraging! Maybe just give it some time.....People will tell you exercise is healthy, but not everyone understands the severity of the physical and mental damage that comes from eating disorders.

You not only have to eat a lot of calories in recovery, but a lot of EXTRA calories if you're going to be exercising, which I just don't recommend anyway, but.......ha......

My ED started off as bulimia and became more of a purely restrictive ED over time. When I finally started recovery, the discomfort with my body felt absolutely intolerable. And I relapsed many, many times. I couldn’t handle how I felt in my body, and I also got stretch marks. 

Eventually I realized I couldn’t keep jerking my body up and down and have been in a solid recovery for a couple of years. I generally do not feel bad in my body anymore. And I don’t think about my stretch marks, really. I really do think it just takes time before you can adjust to a healthy body. It requires a lot of work and patience but you can definitely do it!!"
fuckeatingdisorders,fj5gdtu,t3_fb73wd,1583032017.0,"I think calorie counting is very divisive. Given the inclination disordered people have with developing and sustaining compulsions, there's really no one size fits all. I have to think that if I had calorie counted throughout my recovery I would've had a REALLY hard time committing to eating certain things, because I would've thought, ""Wow, there's THIS many calories in here?""   


I think coming from a restrictive eating disorder, one of the biggest self-imposed myths is that we're going to spiral out of control and eat way ""too much"" food forever and ever. It's just......really not likely. You've been so hyper-focused and obsessed about how much you've eaten for so long, what are the odds you're going to immediately jump off the deep end? 

Also, even if you do eat a lot, it's expected to eat a LOT in recovery. Also, hunger cues are totally messed up in recovery and for a long time after, in my experience. You have to just eat regularly regardless. Some people might say, ""well, what about intuitive eating?"" Honestly that's a luxury you don't have! I often find when I'm not sure if I'm hungry, if I have a couple bites of something, I am hungry. 

I also think it's of upmost importance to let go of the idea of being a ""fake"". If you think you were or are a ""fake"" at having an eating disorder, it kind of just means you just still want to have one,....? I know for me a big turning point in my healing was finally FINALLY not being able to see the disease as romantic anymore, not seeing it as something that made me interesting. Just realizing that I was killing my body and preventing myself from doing anything meaningful with my life, carrying out pointless compulsions, alone.

Forget the fake thing. You're a real person with a real problem. Here's your chance to get better and get your life back."
fuckeatingdisorders,fj5fdfg,t3_fbnj6d,1583031337.0,"Odds are your face will look somewhat different than it did in your illness in the end, but, that only makes sense. 

Stomach bloat and face bloat are hallmarks of recovery. Your body has been through a lot and it has to go through a self-protective phase in recovery. I think how long it lasts is different for everyone. Obviously this is a majorly triggering thing for people in recovery because it seems as if all your worst fears are confirmed. YES, your face will look normal to you again eventually, but you really can't mess around with engaging in ED behaviors to mitigate the physical symptoms. Unfortunately it just requires a lot of patience. 

&#x200B;

My face was super puffy in the earlier part of recovery. It might have even lasted a couple months? Honestly the best thing you can do is to tryyyyyy to not focus on it relentlessly even though that's probably what feels the most natural. 

Healthy coping mechanisms and various forms of support are key here."
fuckeatingdisorders,fj59weh,t3_fbjm4r,1583027690.0,"I think feeling insecure or hyper aware of what or how you're eating around other people is normal for a lot of people, but especially for eating disordered folks. 

You're also taking in a lot of information when you're around people. Reading people's physical cues, facial expressions, listening to what they say, other people in the background. It's a lot of stimulus. 

I actually will sometimes AVOID going out to eat with people if I feel I'm in a vulnerable mental space. I would like to build up a buffer against this, though."
EatingDisorders,fj59i9u,t3_fbcbi6,1583027418.0,"This sounds super challenging, but from an outsider's perspective this really doesn't sound very severe. Not to invalidate your feelings! I just think it's not a relapse grade situation you're dealing with here. Everyone here in the comments has made great points. Forgiving yourself and just moving on, without compensation, is key : )

It's also interesting to hear that alcohol is a trigger for some of you. I feel like it is for me, too and I'm not sure I can pinpoint why. I think it makes me feel sort of groggy and uncomfortable? I think it also puts me in a weird place mentally.  I don't feel grounded, it just makes me feel depressed, kind of. And it definitely elevates my insecurity, both while drinking and the next day."
fuckeatingdisorders,fj4xr78,t3_fbgv2z,1583019440.0,"This post helped me a lot today, actually. Feeling similarly uncomfortable in my own skin but committed to just letting it pass. 

Also I'm PMSing so hard and I swear to God sometimes it feels like the only way to get through the week before my period is to be cryogenically frozen until it's over.  

Was having such a bad body image day I canceled plans with friends, even though that probably would've helped to distract? I usually always push through but I couldn't deal today. Trying to distract myself with other things. Fucking up is not an option : )

fuckeatingdisorders,fj179x8,t3_faw25o,1582914264.0,"What do you mean you don't have behaviors? I'd say restricting at a level we're you feel trapped in illness (whatever your perceived standards of illness are) is a behavior if I ever saw one. 

I think the cycle you're in is really common. 

The saying that ""the only way out is through"" is very true. 

I think the judgement that you're a ""fake"" is obviously extremely disordered and also very common for those with eating disorders. 

Where's the honor in maintaining the lowest BMI/weight? The reward for that is dying faster. 

Also, just because you're going up and down within a small window of weight doesn't mean you're not inflicting serious damage to your body. It's not like you're healthy again at BMI of 19 or 20 after years of restriction, especially for only short periods of time. That's not going to allow for your body to repair any of the damage that's been done. 

Heart complications (and irreversible shrinkage) are a huge danger in eating disorders. Also brain atrophy, which isn't fatal but obviously not good! 

It's really hard. I completely sympathize with where you're at. I've definitely been there. But at the end of the day it's going to be up to you to make the first steps to getting healthy. No matter what anyone says, it's completely possible to make a full recovery. It's hard as fuck, and doctors condoning restrictive diets and being at very low weights doesn't help. 

A lot of people don't want to get healthy. Sometimes it can last for years. I've heard stories from women who've lived a life of (more moderate) restriction for 40 years. They have to grapple with the fact that they dedicated their entire life to the disease. 

It's just not worth it. And if you DO get out of it and achieve true weight restoration you're going to look back on your ED behaviors and understand how locked into the disorder you were. 

The two links I always provide are Tabitha Farrar's YouTube channel, and Emily Trascianko's Psychology Today blog tracking her recovery from Anorexia. They are both now fully and robustly recovered for many years. Tabitha is very no bullshit and has been immensely helpful in my recovery. 

You're capable of more than you think you are! If these people can come back from the brink, anyone can.

fuckeatingdisorders,fixs3xo,t3_fado5q,1582825782.0,"But eating disorders can also be triggered by just falling into energy deficit, say, after having a longer sickness where you lose weight unintentionally, like mono or something. As some of the other commenters here have pointed out, I think ED's can be an automatic coping mechanism for trauma, or are a form of avoidance, but also can just pop up on their own in a purely biological manner. Also, I feel like, even if an ED is triggered by something traumatic, like death of a loved one, at some point, it's no longer about avoiding those emotions solely as it is the habitual/physiological complications of being in starvation mode; inflexible thinking, depression etc. 

&#x200B;

I know for me, my illness began as a response to my mother's passing, but after many years of illness, I think it was just that I was locked into malnourishment and black and white thinking. 

&#x200B;

The Minnesota Starvation Study is really important when it comes to all this, I think, because even though the mean who participated in the study were totally healthy beforehand, so many of the symptoms they developed when they became malnourished mirrored those of an eating disorder, even down to feeling shame for perceived overeating, even though these man had no aspirations to lose weight, they were just participants in a study on the effects of starvation. 

&#x200B;

I think it's dangerous to ONLY psychologize eating disorders. Yes, there's definitely a link to trauma or pain for a LOT of people with eating disorders, but it's not true in every case. I just think the over-simplification isn't applicable. 

&#x200B;

Yes, it's super frustrating and sad to think of all the time I wasted when I was sick, but, you're struggling with a serious disease. And it applies to ALL eating disorders. If you have binge/purge type ED you're still experiencing malnourishment/altered hormones/energy deficit/metabolic trauma etc."

psychicdevelopment,fg0lr1i,t1_ffx93mr,1580410342.0,"Thanks for the insightful reply! 

I'll start documenting in a more concerted manner. I do this with dreams, not sure why I haven't thought to do it with synchronistic moments. 

If I felt I had further proof that I had any psychic leanings I think it would allow me to feel more grounded. I'm always feeling a lot and prone to moments of emotional overwhelm. It's not terribly dramatic, just feel like I get hit with waves and must attempt to keep my solid footing. It would be helpful to not see these moments as random occurrences that ultimately weaken me but just an aspect of my sensitivity that can potentially be used to feel more connected with myself and the energy around me. I feel the need to retreat into seclusion a lot of the time and I'm not sure if this is a good, bad or neutral inclination."
