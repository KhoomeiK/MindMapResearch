TrueOffMyChest,escckqm,t3_c6u712,1561826350.0,"Thank you for posting this. It's really disturbing how socially acceptable it's become in some circles to vehemently despise children to the point of dehumanization. I know too many people who claim to support all mistreated groups of people, but somehow think it's morally acceptable to be unnecessarily cruel to children simply because they ""hate kids"". I am 100% supportive of people choosing not to have children if they don't want to, but that's not a pass to treat children like shit or disregard their lives just because *you* don't want to be a parent. As someone who was raised in an extremely abusive family dynamic, I know how much children can suffer without feeling they can do anything about it. Children are frequently oppressed by their parents and other adults. Don't make a child's life worse by being another shitty adult who mistreated them. The same logic applies to bitterness towards happy parents or people who want children. Being hateful constantly is not a substitute for an interesting personality."

unpopularopinion,ernfhvv,t3_c2pv28,1561051502.0,"There's a difference in being drunk and being black-out drunk. Also, the power dynamic of the two people involved is important. If one person is sober/mostly sober and someone else is passed out drunk, that's obviously rape. But if two super drunk people have sex, it would have to be ""double-rape"".... and there's no point in really pursuing that. I think of it the same way as I think of the age of consent. If two kids have sex, it's sex. If an adult has sex with a child, it's rape, due to the power imbalance. Seems like we should apply the same logic to drunk sex."
unpopularopinion,erf5rvj,t3_c1jvjl,1560800668.0,"Body positivity is supposed to be about *loving* yourself regardless of how your body looks(including height, weight, disabilities, really any physical feature). Unfortunately, many people use body positivity to deny any scientific and medical evidence that being overweight and/or obese is overall bad for health. You can love yourself and still admit that you should probably make an effort to adjust your lifestyle for your own health. Unfortunately, bringing this up to a lot of people simply results in plugged ears."
death,erf3vy0,t3_c1ra3z,1560799400.0,Death anxiety is a normal part of the human experience. We fear the unknown and the idea of losing ourselves to oblivion. Understanding the permanence of death has actually helped me to figure out what I really want from life and has given me motivation that I lacked before. I give a shit about dying because it helps me to live more fully.

bisexual,eq87q3n,t1_eq83z8d,1559860341.0,And I’m in a “straight” marriage now so it almost feels pointless lol
bisexual,eq80lg1,t3_bxfu6p,1559856495.0,"My first experience coming out as bisexual was in high school. A girl pretended to be my friend, was nice to me, and claimed she wouldn’t tell anyone when I told her. She did and I was harassed by the rest of my class about it. I decided then not to identify as bisexual any more.

As an adult, I’ve come out to some of the same people multiple times; they don’t take it seriously at first, including one of my best friends who is a gay man. I think recently it’s finally stuck with him since I brought it up again, but it’s exhausting.

I still don’t feel like I’m “out”."
