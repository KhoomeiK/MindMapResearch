The people that worked for the bus company saw us struggling to take out our luggages once we reached our destination.  Instead of helping us, they had the odassity to say, ""Let the stupid Americans take them out themselves, let's see how long it takes them to figure out that they have to detach the belt/latch holding it in place."" We both turned around, successfully detached the latch immediately and got our luggage out. They stood there in visible shock, bcz they knew we understood them. That's not even the worst part, bcz once they saw our Canadian flags on our luggages they apologized for calling us American, instead of apologizing for their judgement along with their refusal to do their job...... like how is being called the wrong nationality worse???!!!"

beauty,etnk375,t3_ccj6sr,1562989742.0,"I have actually tried ""Dry Brushing"" and ""Muscle  Foam Rolling"" and it has showed significant improving. Also if you mix a little vitamin E oil in your moisturizer (preferably with hyaluronic acid in it) it can help improve fine lines and plump the skin which makes it appear even. Obviously all these things can get annoying bcz they require repetition and frequent/daily  use in order to see results, but you gotta work hard for everything in life so honestly try out. Update us if it works for you too, if you try it!"
