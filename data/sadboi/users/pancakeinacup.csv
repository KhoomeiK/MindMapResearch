I was abused by my grandpa, he abused his daughter too and took off her bedroom door also.  We didn‚Äôt understand what that meant when we were kids and we would go over there for visits and to be babysat.  Their bathroom was built without a door, you had to walk around a divider wall.  Lots of awkward walk-ins, I‚Äôm sure that was just what he was intending.

Talking to my aunt now as an adult, the door removal seemed to have two purposes:  so grandpa could be a voyeur at-will and he could come in and touch her in the night and she couldn‚Äôt lock him out or put things in front of the door to keep him out.  There was also a big hole in the wall of her bedroom that had a board covering it that could be pushed open from a room on the other side.  Apparently one day before the door was removed she locked the door and put a heavy dresser in front of it.  My grandpa got so pissed he grabbed a chainsaw and cut a hole in the wall.

I feel so bad anyone who gets clusters, when my fianc√© gets them he looks absolutely miserable.  I‚Äôve never had one but they look like agony."
CPTSD,flpknmc,t3_fqb0sq,1585361766.0,"I‚Äôm sorry that you are going through this.  I know that this is a difficult thing to process.  My abuser died a couple of years ago, on my birthday.  He was my grandfather.  I was angry, sad, and relieved all at the same time.  It was a rough time.

If you would like anyone to talk to feel free to PM me. 

All the best."
SandersForPresident,flpjtwo,t3_fq2vbj,1585361185.0,"Thank you, sir!  My fianc√© and I sent in absentee ballots a couple of days ago.  I trust that you voted for Jill Karofsky as well?  Not that it‚Äôs my business."
SandersForPresident,flpjjb4,t1_flph0sh,1585360979.0,Welcome to the Bern unit!
migraine,flpihdp,t1_flpfyz5,1585360258.0,"It‚Äôs an effective treatment for cluster headaches (which are also extremely nasty) but generally doesn‚Äôt do anything for migraines.  My fianc√© uses oxygen and triptans for acute relief for his cluster headaches, I only get to use triptans for acute relief for my migraines (for now anyway)."
SandersForPresident,flphz81,t3_fpxukj,1585359921.0,That would be great.  No more driving 4 hours to Illinois to buy the goods from a non-sketchy source.
CPTSD,flp0nv7,t1_flo57ln,1585349308.0,I had these two and BPD.  I was kind of like WTF about adjustment disorder.
CPTSD,flp0jxp,t1_flo233s,1585349245.0,Same.  This seems to be a common one due to the overlap.  I still relate and sympathize with BPD sufferers probably more than those with any other mental illness because I know how horribly they are often treated due to the stigma.
adultsurvivors,flp0167,t3_fq2cfn,1585348946.0,"I was VERY close with my abuser while it was going on, maybe Stockholm-ey at first.  As I got older I realized what was going on and how wrong it was and I tried getting away.  I eventually severed ties.  I maintained no relationship, it caused me to sacrifice other relationships too, which I will regret probably for the rest of my life."
CPTSD,flormce,t3_fpnegm,1585344064.0,"Ugh yes.  I hate it.  I have cried because my food was messed up at a restaurant (not bawl, ugly cry, just bubble eyes) but I was too sad/whatever to ask for a new one so I just didn‚Äôt eat.  Then my fianc√© bought me a different dinner on the way home.  He prefers not to go out to eat after that incident and we almost always get take out.  Or if one of us cooks dinner and it‚Äôs not perfect I can‚Äôt eat it and we have to make something else or go get a new meal.  Some thing with my drinks.  I only drink Diet Coke (or water, but that is exempt from this convo) from a fountain and if it doesn‚Äôt taste right I can‚Äôt drink it and he gets me a new one.  

I just can‚Äôt eat or drink something that doesn‚Äôt taste how I want and I am really sensitive to taste.  I have no idea if that‚Äôs a CPTSD thing or me just being a brat thing."
CPTSD,floqcjc,t3_fpsr61,1585343339.0,She would be happy that she made it out of there but sad about the outcome.  She had a lot of dreams and plans but adult me failed at the follow through and has no one to blame but herself.
CPTSD,flohvf1,t1_flof0cn,1585338611.0,"The thing that bothers me about it is my mom thinks the car incident is funny when it comes up now.  I tried talking to her about some of her parenting ‚Äúmethods‚Äù in the last few years because we have a good relationship now and she thinks she most things right as a parent.  She acknowledges there were somethings she could have done better but she thinks most of it was fine and that really hurts.

Edit: removed a word, oopsie"
CPTSD,flodl9c,t3_fpywzm,1585336244.0,"My mom was like this.  She wasn‚Äôt even the person who I consider my abuser but she was very much like this.  She expected me to basically act as her surrogate while she was at work.  I did all of the cooking and cleaning.  She wrote me a list of chores and if I missed anything or it wasn‚Äôt done to her exact specification there were consequences.  There were bizarre rules, like the towels had to be folded a certain way.  If I didn‚Äôt fold them right she would make me redo it.  I remember one time she pulled them all out of the linen closet to be refolded no less than four times until I was in tears.

There was this other incident where I missed some chore, I can‚Äôt remember what, and she was furious.  It was during summer vacation so ‚Äúthere was no excuse‚Äù and I was just extremely lazy in her eyes.  So the next day she took me to work with her and made me sit in her car in the parking lot to think about it all day.  I was like 12 at the time.  One of her coworkers brought me McDonalds at lunch time and came and talked to me, which pissed my mom off immensely.  

Writing this out I realize I have more than one abuser."
FragileWhiteRedditor,flkezh6,t1_flcyu4t,1585239671.0,"I dated and Indian man for awhile who was from a well off family.  His family absolutely hated that I wasn‚Äôt Indian and would say things about how he needed to find a nice Indian girl while I was in the room.  Needless to say we didn‚Äôt date for very long.  

I won‚Äôt say that all Indians are like that, but it made me feel pretty shitty."

AskReddit,flbxkp1,t3_fnszg7,1585014952.0,"When my daily routine got messed up.  I would go to a local service station 3-4 times a day for a beverage but they closed the self-service beverage station.  Caffeine withdrawal is real.

And the gym closed except for personal training.  That was pretty weird too, I can get in using the employee entrance and pin pad for training but it is super eerie."
