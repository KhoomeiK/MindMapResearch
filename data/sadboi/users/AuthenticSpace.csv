The hard part is I don't have an answer to your feelings on the ticking clock and your ability to find a partner except it's your depression lying to you. I know it is because I struggle with the same thing too.

We just have to keep going. Keep trying. Supposedly, some things get easier as you get older. Maybe the prime of our lives hasn't even happened yet.

I keep thinking that because I like younger dudes, they aren't going to want me until I've aged like a fine wine. Does it suck? Yes. I want a man now!

But the point is, we're never going to know if we decide this is it. I struggle with depression. I don't want to live like this. But I also have hope that there's more, and that what I want is still out there.

Just keep going forward. You don't have to like it. You don't have to feel good about it. Just find any reason to stay and keep going.

You are loved, whether you love yourself or not. You matter, even if you don't think so."
