BPD,flii5nv,t3_fonk8g,1585183033.0,"Sending you a virtual, social distance permitted, hug my friend. 

And like another commenter says, you should radically accept that youâ€™re a powerful writer, if you havenâ€™t already, and hopefully use that to your advantage somehow. I hope things improve for now"
BPD,flatlt2,t3_fnk1kh,1584990867.0,"Yep dating, esp app dating, is an absolute nightmare! And itâ€™s no better for men than women by all accounts. But lately Iâ€™m trying to tell myself that â€˜itâ€™s not me, itâ€™s themâ€™! ðŸ˜‚"
BPD,fiare3j,t3_f6vlao,1582306920.0,"Yes, I remember a series of crazy crushes, one after another in fats succession, around the age of 15, and one hopeless infatuation which dragged on pointlessly for literally years. Looking back, all of them prompted this huge yearning in me, which I still feel today whenever someone triggers my romantic attachment / abandonment issues. i.e whenever I'm into someone"
BPD,fi4ivdv,t3_f5fjfx,1582142069.0,"Yeah itâ€™s a HUGE DEAL!! And inspirational for many of us Iâ€™m sure. I needed to read this today, thank you. Very Best of luck with the job and your ongoing recovery!"
BPD,f7g3htv,t3_dvsfue,1573693604.0,"Wow. Very well said! But do they choose us, or we them?"
BPD,f72dk94,t3_dtj3lq,1573359501.0,"Yep, for me it's TV and radio, sometimes my own music. Have to have something on constantly in the house when I'm alone, except last thing at night oddly."
BPD,f727tm7,t3_du3ype,1573355231.0,God I struggle massively with this too.
BPD,f6zhnyd,t3_dtfw13,1573316849.0,"Yes and I used to get really frustrated, even resentful and angry, if someone close to me doesn't reciprocate my taste in music, films or whatever. Like I'd feel a really jarring disconnect and take it quite personally. I'm single for the first time in many years and trying to rediscover my own identity and passions but it's hard. I keep defaulting to things to things I shared with my ex and trying to connect with her about those things."
BPD,f5jcju7,t3_dntyl9,1572224717.0,"100% yes. But I suppose nothing's permanent anyway. We're all just counting down to death really, or trying to distract ourselves from that reality. Unless you both happen to die at the same time, there can be no other ending to any relationship.

 I stayed in one relationship for many years. It was stable and my partner seemed to love unconditionally. But I felt bored, unfulfilled, frustrated. That chronic feeling of emptiness which I read somewhere as being like a constant state of yearning. It was only then, when I read that, that it all made sense. I regret ending it now but don't feel I had any choice in it. Besides its wouldn't be fair to my ex."
BPD,f546j4r,t3_dmjt1g,1571972487.0,"Yep. Def strongly prefer female company and seek out female friends more than male. Whether that's just validation seeking, looking for a mother figure or whatever I'm not sure..."
BPD,f546373,t1_f2z5j6f,1571972147.0,Nail meet head. Yet at the same time I'm completely addicted to it. Like the mouse who doesn't learn that pulling that lever will only give him an electric shock.
BPD,f544j8n,t1_f33jn1c,1571970979.0,"Yup. Mine hasn't spoken to me for 5 weeks, after I lashed out at her. I'm constantly wondering if she's ever going to speak to me again. It's sheer hell really. Just feel what's the point in doing anything? I'm just treading water, keeping going until she decides to hit the restart button."
BPD,f543geb,t3_ddavfz,1571970200.0,"I can relate to the quieter end of BPD. I seldom lash out, but I have done in times of high emotion when I've felt mistreated by a romantic partner / prospect, or with family members. Instead I self judge / edit, ruminate a lot, scenario plan and basically fume quietly in private. Ha, healthy eh!"
BPD,f5424na,t1_f3iixqg,1571969230.0,"OMG, I could've written this! It's completely the point I'm at now. And I feel like I'm wearing a sign round my neck to that effect too! :))"
