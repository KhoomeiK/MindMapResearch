To be put simply, if SF and FF are negotiating, SF dont hold the balance of power, when they should.

They said they were ready to lead the country but didnt have enough confidence in themselves to run the numbers required to do so. 

And also if you harbour legitimate hopes of being a majority government party you are going to need to run a bit more that 42 candidates when 80 is needed. No matter how well they did they were going to be constrained by simple arithmetic. If some how they went with FF, they would be the minority party with a 3rd party also at the cabinet.

ireland,fhda6ae,t3_f2kxv0,1581480790.0,"SF won the popular vote, as you would know it. So they won the most 1st preference votes. 

FF won the most seats, 38 to 37.

Also 38 represents a poor day out for FF. Where as 37 for SF is a massive gain on any prior election for them. 

We operate a Proportional Representation - Single Transferrable Vote(PR-STV) for elections. The manner in which votes transfer would lead to any movement from most votes to most seats. It's amongst the fairest implemented systems in the world. 

SF did a very bad job of managing they system, namely not running enough candidates. 

It is a bit of a fallacy to say they are known for not forming a government together. This is because SF would have never held enough seats to be considered in a coalition. 

The party in its current form(tounded 1970) did not have TDs until 1997. 

1997:1
2002:5
2007:4
2011:11
2016:23

FF last formed a government in 2007. That should explain itself.
