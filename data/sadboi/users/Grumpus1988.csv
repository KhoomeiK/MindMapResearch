Anxiety,fo80gmg,t3_g5zaev,1587587711.0,"Don't. At first it may seem great to find the instant off switch and not have to deal with the thoughts and anxiety of life. Sooner or later, you need it to feel at ease. To switch off. To enjoy life. 
A point will come where it feeds the beast. Paranoia will grow. Anxiety will grow. You're moods will be affected by it. 
You may even hit a point where you have no weed left and suddenly, you have no off switch to get away from it. 
It is addictive. Anyone that says otherwise is either full of shit or doesn't know any better. It kills productivity. If you're not fully developed, it kills brain development. 

In short, please don't use it as a crutch. Find other ways to busy your mind. Start a new hobby. Read a book. Get some exercise. Eat healthy more than you'd eat shit food. Meditate. 

Weed is not a good solution for anxiety."

I cut out all junk food and red meat. Maybe had white meat once in a week. It's hell.

3 days before the test I ate nothing but junk food and takeaways to put fat back into my system so the thc would bind to it. 
Day of the test I drank loads of water, a can of original monster energy 2 hours before the test and an orange isotonic sports drink 30 mins before test. Adds colour to the piss so it doesn't look diluted.
