traaaaaaannnnnnnnnns,filzn35,t1_filzf4z,1582514271.0,"Thank you for apologizing. But its not a ""cool"" thing, it's a literal medical condition. That's like going around saying, ""wow, I would really like to have fibromyalgia. Just seems fun."" not trying to be a dick, just trying to put it into perspective. You dont need to know a lot about a condition to know that you shouldn't be saying ""wow I wish I had that"""
traaaaaaannnnnnnnnns,filzc3s,t1_fily1d1,1582514053.0,You..... *want* to be medically violated at birth? You *want* to only have representation as a fucked up joke? You serious are saying you *want* a medical condition that changes people's lives. See a therapist.

schizophrenia,fhtjapt,t1_fhtcf3s,1581874931.0,It's so good to read this because I always feel an intense sense of something similar to boredom before my episodes. Thank you.

schizoaffective,fhtj1gc,t3_f4tp51,1581874838.0,"That's horribly insensitive of her. I often question if that's the case with myself, which my therapist always said was a delusion. If shes encouraging you to ignore your symptoms and saying your hallucinations (etc) are real, she is not good for you to be around."
schizophrenia,fhrq6qg,t3_f4iewu,1581834270.0,How can it detect psychotic episodes beforehand? I used to have a service dog and I was only able to train anxiety response (alongside tasks to mitigate my physical disabilities).
