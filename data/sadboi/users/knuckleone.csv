Being super manipulative and controlling, the ability to control others really easily.  Always causing drama that would drive a normal person nuts but being unaffected by it.  And a morbid obsessive competitiveness with certain people.  They seemed to be motivated by and always reacting to the actions of other people, not any internal desires.

the sounds of a suffering animal

i was walking the stairs to my apartment and heard a dog barking desperately.  it was 630 and i'm sure it's owner had been gone all day.  This dog, left to suffer in silent loneliness, cabin fever and boredom increasing it's anxiety and madness., th  we get these pets, these animals that beg for us to 'walk' them.  we avoid using the word 'walk' around them because the false promise of outside and temporary discharge.  These are animals, with a higher need than us for physical activity and catharsis.  They stay at home, alone, for 10 hours with no television, no magazines, no books, no access to the outside, socialization, release of any kind.  You see youtube videos, of pets left home alone, doing cute and loving things.  I saw one where a dog gripped it's owners shoe's shoe string, dragged it up to a couch, and curled up and nuzzled the shoe with it's nose, laying in a sleeping position, still and awake.  It was probably 10:45am, the dog looking down the barrel of a brutally long and lonely day of passing time with no entertainment, no words, no responsibilities to give meaning or to think about, no visitors, no television, no sounds, nothing.  A compete vacuum of stimulation, living oblivion.  You want to know why your dog is so loving and loyal?  You want to know why he's so happy to see you when you come home, sometimes scratching at the door at the sound of you approaching?  Because the daily suffering will be over for the brief period of time after you get home and before you go to bed.  All the comments in the post were ""aww, so cute"" and ""animals are so much better than people"", and ""be still my heart"".  Sadistic ignorant bastards.  the existence of pets is inhumane.  There was a man i met once who owned a business and a warehouse.  He had 2 chocolate labs that were brother and sister, and he brought them to work everyday.  they roamed the warehouse, played with each other, and interacted with the people who came in and the other workers.  Amazing i thought, what happy dogs.  That's the only way it should be.  If a being is forced to be imprisoned, dependent, and left to suffer, it should be illegal.  How does PETA justify this?

I would like to see brain scans of pets left regularly in isolation.  Just like humans, bad things happen."

All my woes and inability to make a relationship with a girl work, a simple result of my trying to be something I wasn’t.   I imagined a coming out / to my true self and new life a new beginning, the light at the end of the tunnel, healed.  But, no attraction to men ... but maybe, it might happen one day, but probably not.  I may be destined to a fruitless search for romance with paranoid relational attempts with women"
relationship_advice,fc40v4x,t1_fc2o8mw,1577403683.0,I understand that and I’m actually ok with it myself.  I feel more guilty for not wanting her that way than unsatisfied with her.   I’ve been with other girls that were nice to look at and had no connection with them at all and I wouldn’t want to go back to that.  I just feel a little bit like this is unfair to her.
relationship_advice,fc40om0,t1_fc2p09v,1577403546.0,"It’s actually not a big deal for me the sex, the real issues I have is I feel kind of guilty about not wanting her that way.  I can’t be with anyone else, she’s the only person I’m compatible with but I feel she’s getting f the short end of the stick"
relationship_advice,fc40kcd,t1_fc2rsxp,1577403456.0,It’s not ideal buts it’s actually not a huge deal to me.  I actually feel more guilty about her not being satisfied than I am concerned for me being satisfied.  I feel a little bit like she is getting the short end of the stick as there would be someone out there that would want her physically.

Pets,fbwsld7,t3_eeo8w6,1577158327.0,"There’s no way out but through, there’s no comforting words in this time.  It’s a living hell.   Life shouldn’t end this way, it’s not right.  Be strong, be weak ... love for you and your pup"
schizophrenia,fbg2tns,t1_fbfypy4,1576831519.0,"Agreed, but the stigma.   In my case there are a few people who know but my paranoia prevents me from talking about it with virtually anyone for fear of the gossip"
schizophrenia,fbfjwqj,t3_ed25kc,1576812394.0,Why would you tell anyone?
schizophrenia,fbd6q26,t3_ecpk4l,1576749631.0,If your job doesn’t require it you won’t get fired for not talking.   You get fired for not doing your work or being openly disrespectful or disruptive.
schizophrenia,fb9s3c6,t1_fb9g8ih,1576647811.0,"It really is the guiding and force in all healthy relationships outside of your family.   Men are bonded and leagued together through the competition for and alliances to get sex and the goals related to it.  We are bonded with our enemies, patient and persistent in competition in these mutually beneficial adversarial relationships, locked into what would be an annoying and bothersome union, without the desire for winning the attention of a woman.  There truly is the one common goal of all human beings that most of us share, the pursuit of either relationships or sex.  Think of how many conversations are had about the pursuit of sex and love.  

It really is the basis of everything and without that guiding desire life is fruitless and empty, it’s the fundamental goal of existence and anyone who can’t admit that simply can’t admit that, yet knows it’s true.

And those hypocritical women, saying I want a man who appreciates who I am and just doesn’t want to fuck me.  Nothing enrages a woman more than a man who isn’t actively and aggressively doing everything he can to get into her pants."
schizophrenia,fb9ee9m,t1_fb9dtng,1576636394.0,I’ve been off meds for 4 years and it never came back.  I think it was the Paxil that did it that is said to have permanent sexual side effects.  Fucking bastards.   I was crazy before but at least I was getting laid.  I was such a beast before that my test levels must have been through the roof because all girls wanted me.  Now there nothing there and if I’m unfortunate enough to acquire a woman’s naked acquaintance I’m as useless as a discarded scumbag.
schizophrenia,fb6sjcp,t3_eboqal,1576558968.0,"Yes.  People watch me all the time, but I’m guilty of it too.   I’m a people watcher.   I’m such a hypocrite in that I all go to the mall and simple be around and look at strangers to pass the time, but I hate it being done to me.   It enrages me a strangers attention."
schizophrenia,fb6m9fx,t1_fb6ljj5,1576553780.0,"Lol.  Yeah.  I used to love it, I used to LOVE it.  No I don’t, I remember the first time I did it after I came off my meds after 6 years or so medicated, I was like this is weird, somethings different.  

I think without properly functioning neurotransmitters like dopamine oxytocin serotonin etc, you don’t get the proper reward for doing it and it just throws the entire thing way off.  It’s good when your brain tells you it’s good, it’s not when it doesn’t.  I kind of hate that I used to love because i want to want it again"
schizophrenia,fb6kzwc,t1_fb63dis,1576552884.0,"Agreed m, OP it’s ok for your family to have whatever beliefs they have, i personally believe they are ignorant to say the very least, but it’s your responsibility unfortunately to take ownership of your treatment at this point.  And I think this is great advice to have them sit with your doctor, the doctor will probably not change their minds but you will need support and confidence in sticking to your treatment in spite of your family’s outspoken and imposing ignorance"
schizophrenia,fb6kir2,t1_fb6hg4i,1576552545.0,"I was responding to OP.  I’m kind of disillusioned with religion, I went to it for its promises to help and heal but thinfs have progressively gotten worse in spite of my faith and prayers.   I don’t expect anything different in the natural, but Christianity seems to say that i should.  I tried for awhile and just lost the faith and belief I had in it because none of the promises in the New Testament came true for me.  Jesus said all the things that god does for you and none of it happened"
schizophrenia,fb6edkw,t1_fb69mgz,1576548206.0,I think your family is wrong thinking religion can make you healthy.  You may already know that
schizophrenia,fb63ypj,t3_ebl410,1576540789.0,"You’ve been to church with your family?  How do they consolidate the idea of gods power with the fact that you are still schizophrenic?   I’m sure they say you just don’t have enough faith.  But Jesus said that faith as small as a mustard seed is enough?   Why then, are you not healed?   Sometimes I wonder if it’s possible the promises of Jesus and the Bible are not true because they don’t seem to work"

schizophrenia,fb34k57,t1_fb2ls2m,1576464090.0,"It’s no cure but it helps with the stress.  I find it plugs up some of the holes in m brain.  But it’s not easy, doing it everyday.  When I miss a day I have a bad day and I’m able to do it probably about half of the days, when my insomnia is bad I don’t have the energy to do it before work, if I sleep on the couch my back hurts so it’s hard to do it then.  I guess my point is life is a sort of ironic living hell."
schizophrenia,fb2a0wq,t3_eazjb7,1576447495.0,It’s hard to stick to it because of time constraints but have you tried an exercise routine?  I find a workout in the morning helps me a great deal for the day.   Its not a cure like meds but it’s the only non medication alternative that helps.  Maybe that in conjunction with the lower dose might work.
schizophrenia,fb1mw5u,t1_fb1ia5c,1576438613.0,"What did you do?  I adhere to a pretty strict rule of no tv phone screens etc starting at 8pm, no caffeine ever, get up at the same time everyday, never get into bed unless I’m tired and going to sleep and try to exercise once a day, if there’s is the slightest deviation from the plan no sleep at all.  I have a nice mattress that provides good sleep when my mind does not wake me up as soon as I’m in it.  The only thing that has worked has been having someone in the bed with me, I think my isolation and loneliness warps  and dements my mind and for some reason the effects are most noticeable at times of rest / trying to rest."

I try to explain it to her but she will be Silent for a moment then kind of argue back at me about it, ie you like porn so you are not asexual.  How often do you do it?  The times I’ve recently done it I was so passionless it felt so empty and strange"
schizophrenia,faqv0rc,t1_faqtkv0,1576308540.0,"Yes I have the exact same delusions but the things I hone in on are more subtle.  I usually find when I speak people become silent and turn up their volume once I’ve become silent again.  Like standing in a cashier.  A guy might be talking to his girlfriend until I begin my verbal exchange with the cashier.  He stops talking to hang in my every word to size me up based on my speech and go into overdrive conversing with his girlfriend again. Once I’m done talking.  There’s always this subtle competition, someone talking to someone else, looking at my while doing so, showing off to me, a complete stranger, one how loud and charismatic they are.   I’m minding my own business, I don’t care and we don’t share any common goals.  And the. The discomfort people have when interacting with me, I sometimes will look at them like they are crazy like why are you so nervous, knowing full well it’s because they are talking to a crazy person and experiencing what psychiatrists refer to as ‘observer discomfort’ as an indicator of a persons sanity."
schizophrenia,faqskfh,t1_faqqgab,1576307537.0,"That’s great to hear congratulations, that’s a nice perspective on it.  I don’t know though.  Women are so impatient these days.   It’s hard to find one that isn’t completely disgusted by a man that isn’t aggressively trying to get into their pants.  There is a girl that in very close to and would say that I love but we’re not in a relationship and although it would make her happy the act is still uncomfortable for me.  She is very passionate and gets so horny and I just get nothing from it.   But I guess like you’re saying maybe in that area it shouldn’t be about me it should be about her"
