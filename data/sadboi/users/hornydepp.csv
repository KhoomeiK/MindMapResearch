You explained to your girlfriend that's just how it is. Also, she doesn't even speak French. The fact she made a huge deal over prices on a menu she can't even read is asinine. And again, it is a menu. If she really just wanted to look at prices, you guys could've easily shared yours, and she would've  asked. Not to mention that with sharing the menu, you could've easily made it a teaching moment for her to learn some french words. She isn't an asshole because was disheartened by it. She's the asshole because instead of getting over something as small as a menu that she couldn't even read, she decides to consistently bring it up months later and call you sexist. *You* are not sexist.

In my case, no insurance, anywhere from 50 USD to over 250 USD per hour. 

So lets say my doc costs 125 USD, just for a mid number, and I have one visit per week. Thats 500 USD by the end of the month. That's not even including any medications that I'd be prescribed, if any. 

So say I'm prescribed Lexapro just for shits and gigs, per pill that's 8.27 USD for just 5 mg. So a 30 day supply would cost 248 USD and some change.

I also have ADHD. So let's say I was prescribed adderall for it, just for a well known drug. For a supply of 100 of 5mg adderall is around 791 USD. 

So all in all, in the first month I'd be spending about 1,539 USD or £1,224.74. Without the adderall it'd be about 745 USD or £592.87.

Then there's the not so lighthearted things:

No one really cares about how you feel.

You have depression? Suck it up.

Wanna kill yourself? Welp, sucks to be you.

If you don't physically express that you're happy 24/7, you're seen as less of a man. Not like anyone would help make you feel better anyway.

The constant societal pressure to look like Chris Evans.

You have to be assertive, but not too assertive.

You HAVE to make the first move, but if they don't like the advance you're seen as a creep.

You can't be alone with your daughter without someone giving you a side eye because they think you're a predator.

9 times out of 10, you will lose custody of your children even if the mother is completely irresponsible and incompetent.

You hit a woman out of self defense? Guess what, you're going to jail.

Falsely accused of rape or any other sexual misconduct? Oh boy, IF you do get found innocent, you better pack your bags a move 5 states away. In this same context, the chances of you even being found innocent are seemingly astronomical.

You're always expected to be amazing at sex even if you're inexperienced.

You will always be seen as a dumbass even if you're not.

You will always be the stupid, incompetent father even if you do everything in the house.

You will get no respect as a single father.

You will always be seen as violent even if you're the most gentle creature on earth.

You will always be seen as a predator even if you basically have no sex drive.
