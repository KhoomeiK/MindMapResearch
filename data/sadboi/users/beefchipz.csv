* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwjsO6aniig](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwjsO6aniig) D!NG  feat. Vsauce (Starts 1:10)
* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6\_u18uFEoN0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_u18uFEoN0) More advanced knowledge needed, but you'll learn how the Mandelbrot and Julia sets are calculated through an iterative process. Also talks of how you can represent complex numbers with a magnitude (distance from origin to the complex coordinate) and phase (direction/angle).
* [http://davidbau.com/conformal/#z](http://davidbau.com/conformal/#z) Complex number grapher, fun to play with if you know what you're doing. Just type an equation‚Äîinvolving ""z""‚Äî and it will express the values of the numbers through color.

Imaginary numbers do not have a quantifiable value, but we can visualize them with i, and an imaginary plane.In this plane the horizontal axis is for the real component ""‚Ñù"" and the vertical axis is for imaginary component ""ùëñ"".

You may not get everything that Vsauce talks about in the video & that's okay, you do learn this in school eventually and most kids don't give a damn about the subject. :P

What I find fun about complex numbers is they give solutions to ""impossible"" expressions: ln(-1) = pi\*i; sqrt(-1) = i; sin(z) = 2, and so on (exception is |z| = -1, absolute value is **always** positive because it will represent the magnitude of the complex vector).

In the real world they prove to be useful, quaternions involve complex numbers, and are often used to describe the orientation of a smartphone. Many intricate physics engines use quaternion matrices, e.g.: Roblox.Electrical engineering makes use of imaginary numbers as well.There are many more uses I do not know of, but they're there. :)

TL;DR imaginary numbers good (Have a nice day <3)"
