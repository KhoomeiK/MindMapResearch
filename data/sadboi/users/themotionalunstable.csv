mentalhealth,fmt3y4r,t3_fxa7gq,1586366481.0,"Dear friend, 

Asking for help sometimes hold people who have suicidal thoughts from taking action. I am, as you, moved by this tragedy as I have lost in the past friends from suicide. Let me tell you that thinking of what we could have done different is something we all do, but sometimes it would be better for us and for the memory of our friends lost if we think of those things they could have done differently. What would they have done if they had found courage and faith within those difficult times of misery? Wouldn't they want us that in the midst of this tragedy to understand what they couldn't do what wanted us to do if we dealt with the same missery?

Let us think of how to honor their memory as we remember them.

Let us find purpose so they would never be forgotten. 

Let us stay safe."
mentalhealth,fmt1jbf,t3_fxa1y0,1586365371.0,"I suffer from obsessive thinking, being fighting against them...sometimes they have driven be to that place, the one you mention, to a place where you feel crazy. Between someone not knowing and knowing there is only you. You are the only one who experiences what goes on inside you, the only one who understand why you do some things that often look rare or ""out of place"". 

My life with obsessive thinking has taught me that it is better to let your love ones know why you are doing what you are doing, what is the purpose? You want to get distracted, and often that is the way to end the thought process, by doing something such as cooking or painting, anything that doesn't need much thought. But it is important to come to terms with your love ones, so they would understand that you are doing what you are doing because you are suffering from such an unquiet mind. 

I may not understand why you are painting, for example, the wall in your room, and I would assume something wrong, maybe I'll react angry, but if you could explain me, as you did, that it is something that is calming you down and preventing you from suffer the consequences of thinking so much and so deeply, Ill be doing my best to help, maybe letting you paint those walls or maybe talking to you about other activities you could do which are fine for both of us. 

Think that no-one knows and because they don't know they are unable to help. 

Stay safe and if you are having bad thoughts, please ask for help to hotlines or preventive lines. Call the police or any organization that could help you go through those hard times."

mentalhealth,fmlyvac,t3_fw2ymr,1586195691.0,"Lets break the problem down together...

1)It seems that you have no way to check if you did sent pictures to someone while dating with your girlfriend. 

2)She has low self esteem.

3)You are shaking and freaking out. 

Thought very connected to one another, it might be useful see these problems individually. Let's try to tackle what you can do right now. You can reduce the anxiety and the worry soothing yourself with activities you know work for you when experiencing this emotional state. 

The next thing you could do is to problem solve. If the problem can't be solved as you wished to, what is the second and third best chance. Should it be a thoughtful apology? Should it be an action that express sincere love? What works? What works with your girlfriend?

Lastly, the fact that she has low self esteem might not be workable in the short term. This trait of character would indeed make someone doubtful even when there are more reasons to trust and be confident. To validate and accept that this will be an obstacle that surpasses anything you have truly done."
mentalhealth,fmlvqy8,t3_fw2pgk,1586194112.0,"Once I met a girl, lovely and unimaginably smart. Light of the day, light of the night I would say.. We started a relationship and soon after, she told me about an experience that was heartbreaking and that would tear us apart: she was abused sexually after having few drinks with a stranger. She had been suffering from major depressive disorder since 5 and treated for it at 8. By that time, I was beginning a new life after being hospitalized for 6 month in a psychiatric hospital.

We both had severe mental affects but loved each other. We both received treatment, however she was skeptical with her therapists after almost 15 years without considerable improvement in her quality of life. The time we spent together was one of my most beautiful and enriching experience. This is what we did to make things better between us.

1) **Accurate expression.** We were assertive. We new the cost of treating emotional instability alone and we tried to avoid solving problems by our own. We helped each other problem solve, and more importantly, we validated our experiences. 

2) **Validate.** To figure out what is valid of other's experience is important. To have in mind that fully understand someone is extremely difficult and often impossible give us the power to validate and understand easier. 

3) **Feedback.** we spent thirty minutes every week giving feedback to one another. We would talk about things the other did that brought us joy, but also consider those things where improvement could be done. Always assertively. 

4) **Problem Solve.** We helped each other bringing family and friends to the equation, to the path to recovery. We knew that having more than one helpful relationship would make the load less disruptive for us. 

5) **Build Positive Experiences.** We went anywhere we could take good pictures and make valuable moments out of thoughts and worries. 

Hopefully one or more of this habits would suit you. Thank you for sharing and for caring or others with mental health difficulties. 

We are a family. We are connected through our difficulties but also through our desire to live a life worth living. 

Take good care of yourself above all."

Needless to say, try to improve your emotional pain with soothing activities.

She felt guilty and ashamed, and fortunately she asked for help. She was released when understood that dozens of mothers suffer from similar unwanted thoughts. 

I once read a book called THE IMP OF THE MIND BY LEE BAER. It makes the point that bad thought are very common, and there's people who get obsessed with them - and like my uncle feel ashamed and worried - but others believe that not giving them much attention its better.

But I can relate: even when I was vacationing at the most beautiful place with my loved one, thinking of all the possibilities waiting for me as I succeeded in college, sadness would hit me hard. 

I learnt that often we are hit by things we thought to be far from our scope. I like to think that some emotional experiences are like a virus: even when the symptoms are gone, the virus remains doing no harm, and sometimes the symptoms com back again. It is easy to feel like the things around us are triggering those symptoms when it is just the virus. 

Yes, objectively it seems that there are reasons to be happy, and probably you can count some moments, maybe small ones, where you have appreciated them, but the power to experience sadness among all that joy is something real. It is important to place some behavioral strategies to wisely record moment where you do appreciate what you have. I will give you simple steps. 

1) Take note by observing and describing moments where you feel like appreciating something or someone. 

2) Take note by observing and describing moments where you feel like not appreciating what you have today, and try to be curious. Ask a couple of questions intending to bring explanation of those unwanted thoughts or feelings. 

3) Set aside those questions and try to place some time to tackle them."
mentalhealth,fmidlcs,t3_fvdjba,1586107471.0,"You are so brave. I want to say first that I admire what you are doing. Help if so difficult to find, and good help is even more difficult. 

My advice to you first is to understand that parents worry and even as parents they often have emotional reactions that don't help. If you want them to understand your sadness, it is important that you validate and understand that they have the right to be scared and feel worried for you. Your friends, or your boyfriend can feel scared and worried as well, but often they also feel love and compassion. Fear is one of the emotions out of all those emotions that appear when they realize you are going through a bad time.  

I am sure that you would find love, compassion, worry or fear appear naturally when a loved one suffers emotional or physical pain and your aim is to help. Those emotions motivate us to help!

Surely you have fear that they would be scared and respond in unhelpful ways. Between you and me, to express that fear you is as important as expressing your sadness. If you are thinking of ways to do it, try out this worksheet. It has helped me when I needed to express a difficult state of mind.

I had to move out from my homeland and then from the country where I was studying to start a degree in psychology. I feel you, and to you I want to say this:

1) The way you describe your feelings points to anything but an excuse. It looks to me, from what I can read, that you are willing to do anything to make your situation better. 

2) I want to point out that in this paragraph, you give yourself a clue of what is related to the time you felt ""really well"". You describe things like working out, playing football, taking care of yourself, cutting some social ties and giving more value to a particular group: your football team. It is important to make a good description of what worked when you start feeling well. 

3) It seems to me that your future plans could trigger a lot of anxiety. They are huge changes. Have you considered that some of those feelings of anxiety and deep sadness are cues that are calling you to reflect more about what you are going to do? Emotional states have a purpose.
