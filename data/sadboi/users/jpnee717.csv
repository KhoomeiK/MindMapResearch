Meds do help with the long term mood swings from the bipolar disorder, but sometimes it's hard to tell because BPD is not usually treatable with medication. So, I still get the quick mood swings associated with BPD (minutes to hours) which in turn can possibly trigger a bipolar episode, if the bipolar is not properly medicated for. 

Let me tell you, it sucks. Here's an example. Manic episodes are rare for me, but when they occur I get really agitated and irritable, which I somewhat contribute to the BPD traits interacting with the manic state. They are not ""fun"". I severely damage relationships and myself. Depression is decently controlled with my meds, but can still be triggered by some sort of BPD crisis, which can be way frequent. 

Psychotherapy is a must for treatment of personality disorders, and for mood disorders as well. With just meds, I felt stable but could breakdown with such fragility... Idk. One on one, group, DBT, CBT, whatever you pick, are paramount."

bipolar,fc651he,t1_fc64ve7,1577472433.0,Omg what a piece of shit psychiatrist. Maybe look for a new one and see what they're open to and what you are willing to try. Finding a good one can take a while tho. There's like a perpetual shortage of psychiatrists. I'm glad you're feeling better now üôÇ
bipolar,fc63mpc,t3_egdykh,1577471517.0,"After a manic episode, of course someone would want to be extra cautious about having another. Reaching out to help identify potential warning signs is perfectly fine and is a healthy thing to do. I'm more concerned about why this makes you so irritated and angry enough to post some negative bs like this. Rapid cycling can occur in 5-10% (tho I've also seen 10-20% estimated) of sufferers. That doesn't sound rare to me. Most people with bipolar, I'm guessing, might not even know the term rapid cycling, or even give it any thought when they may be experiencing it."
bipolar,fc635z8,t1_fc62s3u,1577471220.0,"He only wants you to feel better, so make sure you use the opportunity to take care yourself and take control of the illness. I think following thru with treatment alone shows him you ppreciate the help. I wish you good luck and recovery from this fucking awful disorder. üòÅ"
bipolar,fc62k9m,t3_ege5ji,1577470828.0,"I had a friend similarly help me when I was last hospitalized. I am so grateful and idk what I can do to reciprocate that kind of care he gave me. I thanked him and was open about my experience there and the positive effect it's had. I think the sharing of my experience helped him feel involved and that I trust him. I hope that shows that I am grateful and honest to him. And honestly, my friend did it to help me and most likely doesn't want me to feel indebted to him in anyway."
bipolar,fc61z59,t3_egduit,1577470453.0,"Is he diagnosed with some type of bipolar disorder? If so, do you know if they're giving a mood stabilizer along with the antidepressant? If not, that's not going to help much and can actually worsen the bipolar"

bipolar,fc27snt,t3_efr2de,1577344428.0,It is definitely possible to be diagnosed with bipolar and OCD. Is there something else that makes you doubt your diagnosis?
bipolar,fc263s3,t1_fc16wsy,1577342086.0,"Unfortunately I don't know if you can get him to know. He needs to have his own motivation. I'd stress the importance of therapy, because I tried to solely depend on meds and I still ended up in the hospital. Just try to make him aware of what his behavior is causing, which I'm sure you have. Beyond that, idk. Things will get worse to the point he needs hospitalization, and that's what snapped me into taking care of myself. You don't  necessarily have to make an ultimatum, but make him aware of the additional boundaries you'll have to put in place should he not seek more help. Hopefully that works out in some way"
indianapolis,fc1clbc,t1_fc1cfy1,1577314738.0,"Ah, I was thinking it would be more like one on one. But yeah, if more than that it won't work for sure"
indianapolis,fc16otb,t3_efl9fs,1577309804.0,One World Market in Castleton next to the Buffalo wild wings. It's a Japanese market but they have a kitchen with great food. One thing I like is that you can pick out your own fish from the grocery and they can slice it up right there and make you some sashimi. My go to for sure
bipolar,fc1688v,t3_efm1iy,1577309427.0,"Ask about getting another script in the meantime cause I'm sure they don't want you to go completely unmedicated. If they aren't willing, some urgent care centers will give you stop gap refills and make a referral for you. The one I used to work for did that for people."
