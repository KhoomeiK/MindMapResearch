3. it's fine to have standards but be careful not to set them too high lots of women I know have problems due to ""standards"". as my friend said she said, standards are fine but there should be within reason.

2. porn isn't an instruction guide for sex it's a tool for arousal if you follow porn your going to have a bad time. if you are using it to increase arousal then your good. it's literally edited sex

TwoXChromosomes,fpcd5zu,t1_fpcbbya,1588496078.0,then everything is risky. it's worse to be vague is my point. if you are vague it leaves room for the person to interpret the signals wrong. it's way worse to be vague than honest. yes there are some people who cant handle honestly but crazy is crazy and that guy had a few screws loose. everything has risks but being honest is less risky. I've had a girl threaten to stab me because I was honest but most of the time it doesnt happen people just accept it and move on with their lives. heck some of those women have become good friends. my own sister even has told me vague is more dangerous than honesty because most times honestly they back off. if you want to lie that's a different story I know plenty of girls who say they have a BF to get guys to back off that's different that's white lying. lying or honesty both are way better than being vague

I've had women be indecisive towards me and when I walk away are like why didnt you ask me out and I'm like cause I cant get a read on if you like me or not. a lot of my best relationships/friendships were from women who were not wishy washy and made the relationship between us clear as day. indecisiveness is fine within reason but people overuse it a lot of guys hate that indecisiveness because it makes us feel you are just playing around with our feelings. a lot of us are fine with being friends we just dont want to play mind games. we dont want to feel like you are toying with are feelings cause it's the worst.

some people cant take the truth but being indecisive I'd say is worse cause it just stirs the pot until it boils over. if a guy or girl is indecisive I'd move on to the next cause I'm not going to play the game. and more guys are now going that direction and it's for good reason"

saomd just got boring cause it was like the same 4 units with different outfits half the time.

ffbe was a clusterduck and just too confusing on farming and evolving units and very ftp unfriendly.

I tried epic 7 but that also got very boring because it was way too grindy with not enough reward for the grind.

dbz legends cause they went from having good content and really good deals on units to just basically making it a make legends your life deal, along with making the summon gate deals way worse  and big turnoff and not worth the time. 

dis opera ff I really liked it but just did not have to deal with it.
