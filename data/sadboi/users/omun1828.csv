dietetics,flh7c1h,t3_fohkph,1585157419.0,"Mine was $8,500 last year. That doesn't include clothes/shoes that complied with the dress code, food during work, gas money to rotations, maintaining a vehicle, and whatever else you need (I had to spontaneously charge a laptop to my credit card because my other one crashed my my internship wouldn't allow me to use an intern one from home to do assignments). 
You make litterally 0 dollars and do over 40 hours of work a week. Not including the mandatory assignments they tax on. 
I was the only intern out of 8 that had a weekend job and I was absolutely miserable working 7 days a week for an income of around 400 dollars a month. 
I've noticed that the people that usually end up RDs are from upper middle class families. 
I wouldn't of made it if my parents couldnt afford to support me some. The internship just expects you to behave as if you are paid with travel and clothes. Its ridiculous. 
I will say the paid internships are highly competitive. I applied for one and I don't think I was even considered. 
I acquired about financial support and the only thing you can do is a personal loan from your own bank. You are neither a student or an employee in the eyes of the government so no student tax break either. 
Honestly I am so fortunate to have gotten through the process and have such great parents. I absolutely love dietetic work. 
Don't let the money be 100% of the reason you don't do it. You can take a break year to save up. You can do a part time internship so you can work. You can work on nights and weekends if you are doing full time (this was miserable for me but possible). There are options. 
I would say if there is something else you love just as much that interns you during the schooling, like nursing or a dental assistant, you should consider it."

I've been on 60 mg for a couple weeks now, and I've purged less than 5 times since starting, my binges are a lot less frequent and easier to stop (still not 'easy'- but I don't feel 100% powerless). 
I'm able to eat adequate breakfasts and lunches now without panicking (I used to really struggle with allowing myself to consume more than 500 calories before 6 pm), but I'm working on this everyday and it's also helping my binges. 
So back to your specific questions, I wouldn't ask for an appetite suppressant as your appetite isn't really the issue (although it may feel that way). 
For the big picture of what is going on with you to really be seen you might need to see more professionals, like a therapist and maybe a dietitian. There a different reasons people may binge. For me, it was habit and a result of over restriction. For you, maybe you binge to ease a panic attack and dont ever restrict. Maybe they would want to put you on a different medication route then. 
I would tell them that you are interested in medication to help you through this, and you've been reading about how prozac is the only FDA approved medicine for bulimia, and have read various testimonies of others success. (If you want to be direct that's how I would go about it). But be prepared to explain the specifics of your disorder and how it relates to your dietary habits and emotional tendencies for him to get you the best treatment. 
My last advice, BE PATIENT. my progress has been so slow it doesnt even feel like progress, but when I look back even a year ago to where I was, holy cow I'm in a much better place. Even 4 or 5 months ago. 
Good luck to you, and feel free to personally message me with any other questions, insight, thoughts, ect.

BingeEatingDisorder,fe3g9iz,t1_fe3ej38,1578849020.0,"Honestly, who cares what a doctor thinks about you. If they are a good physician they are understanding and want to help people. 
Even with that statement being true, a lot of caring doctors unfortunately don't quite understand eating disorders, and don't quite know how to treat them. 
I would skip the middle step if possible and go straight to a physiatrist. They may want you to see a phycologist, but they may be willing to treat you even if you dont want therapy at this time. Phycatrists are much more understanding of this condition and how to treat it medicinally. 
You just have to be braver than your fear of others judgement to get yourself better. 
When I told my psychiatrist (who i am a patient of for anxiety) he thanked me for telling him and was not judgmental at all. 
I personally don't tell my doctors because I know it's not severe enough where I have physical problems from it, and I don't want it in my patient notes for other doctors to see."

The last year and a half I started normalizing my eating patterns more, but I continue to binge at night. I think this is because it's such an ingrained habit for me now. But as I've tried to normalize my eating habits, I've gained weight, which has led to full criteria for bulimia. Laxitive abuse, purging, over exercising, restricting, ect. 
Recently I've started prozac/fluoxetine and it's really diminished the severity of my binges and I've only purged 2 or 3 times since I started. 
My advice you is maybe look into prozac as it's the only FDA approved drug to treat eating disorders.

I can say this, my plan is to not take this forever. I feel like once I rewire my brain a bit and form new habits (like not starving myself all day long and eating 1500 calories in one sitting) it will definitely be my goal to ween off of it. 
To be clear I spent months refusing medicine absolutely determined I can do it with sheer will power, but failed daily attempts for over a year has led me to this option.

BingeEatingDisorder,fbc4eah,t3_ecjidt,1576715386.0,"I whole heartedly and respectfully disagree with this gentleman's advice. 
Binging is a result of deprivation and restriction. Our bodies are very sensitive to the ""famine and feast"" mode. A characteristic that we have held onto from the early days. Food was often scarce, putting us into ""famine"" mode, then when food was available we would have the survival instinct to ""feast"". Even though food is all around (most of us) we still have this tendency. 
Fasting almost always leads to binging and gaining the weight back, especially if you already have a distorted relationship with food. 
As a dietitian, a 28 day fast would lead to acute malnutrition and a further distorted relationship with food.

Eating until feeling uncomfortably full
Eating large amounts of food when not feeling physically hungry

To start, I will say every situation is case by case. Everyone had their own beliefs of why they are in treatment and what they want from it. This will really dictate how you approach the situation. 

The way I approach these patients is in a very ""counselor"" way. Obviously we are not lisenced phycologist, but you can't approach them like you would a diabetic patients ""this is what you need to do. Bye"" Expect everything to be a mountain with them. I was going with an anorexic patient who had severe anxiety associated with food. She also put herself on many restrictions, vegetarian, dairy free, gluten free, no starchy foods like noodles or potatoes. So she was VERY VERY difficult to feed in the inpatient setting. 

We eventually got her to let go of her gluten rule with some cream of wheat. When I checked on her the next day I asked her what that was like. What was hard about it? What she was proud of herself about? My questions were very emotional based while still keeping food as our medicine.

bulimia,f6hzm86,t3_drf9ob,1572868924.0,">My partner is pretty clueless in general. I had to teach him that I actually need a verbal response when I have a rant or something for example. Otherwise he just sits in silence. He does not know how to be caring so there’s no way he would know how to help or even react to me telling him this. 

This is 100% the reason I have not told my boyfriend. He doesn't even know what to say when i tell him I'm anxious. I've ""tested"" him before eith different subjects and I've concluded I'm just going to end up hurt (or maybe even dumped) if I tell him. I've brought this up to other people and even reddit before and usually people say a) my mental health is none of his buisness b) they would be hurt if their partner hid something like that from them. 

I hate him not knowing because sometimes I think if he was aware I was struggling maybe be would be more mindful of certain steps I take to not BP (like eating at a certain time). If I say im hungry sometimes I'll have to wait a few hours before we do anything about it then as soon ad he leaves I binge. 

Anyways, I've told my sister which was a mistake. She scolded me and told me to go workout. And ive told two friends who gave been really supportive. Maybe find 1 good friend that you think will be helpful and understanding. 

I'd say don't tell your partner right now. I don't think that should be helpful to you."

bulimia,f646uol,t3_dqhpik,1572689043.0,"According to the DSM-5 criteria, to be diagnosed as having Bulimia Nervosa a person must display:

Recurrent episodes of binge eating. An episode of binge eating is characterised by both of the following:

Eating, in a discrete period of time (e.g. within any 2-hour period), an amount of food that is definitely larger than most people would eat during a similar period of time and under similar circumstances.

A sense of lack of control over eating during the episode (e.g. a feeling that one cannot stop eating or control what or how much one is eating).

Recurrent inappropriate compensatory behaviour in order to prevent weight gain, such as self-induced vomiting, misuse of laxatives, diuretics, or other medications, fasting, or excessive exercise.

The binge eating and inappropriate compensatory behaviours both occur, on average, at least once a week for three months.

Self-evaluation is unduly influenced by body shape and weight.

The disturbance does not occur exclusively during episodes of Anorexia Nervosa.

If you arent having the binge episodes I'd still consider this an eating disorder, but probably falls under the category of Other Specified Feeding or Eating Disorder (OSFED)

According to the DSM-5 criteria, to be diagnosed as having OSFED a person must present with a feeding or eating behaviours that cause clinically significant distress and impairment in areas of functioning, but do not meet the full criteria for any of the other feeding and eating disorders.
A diagnosis might then be allocated that specifies a specific reason why the presentation does not meet the specifics of another disorder (e.g. Bulimia Nervosa- low frequency). The following are further examples for OSFED:

Atypical Anorexia Nervosa: All criteria are met, except despite significant weight loss, the individual’s weight is within or above the normal range.

Binge Eating Disorder (of low frequency and/or limited duration): All of the criteria for BED are met, except at a lower frequency and/or for less than three months.

Bulimia Nervosa (of low frequency and/or limited duration): All of the criteria for Bulimia Nervosa are met, except that the binge eating and inappropriate compensatory behaviour occurs at a lower frequency and/or for less than three months.

Purging Disorder: Recurrent purging behaviour to influence weight or shape in the absence of binge eating

There's others too. You need to go to a therapist to get diagnosed, and you may want to go to a doctor to get your electrolytes checked. These are what control your fluid balance in your body. Unless you changed your purging/eating habits recently, the ten pounds is likely water weight. 

I copied and pasted most of my information from https://www.eatingdisorders.org.au/eating-disorders/what-is-an-eating-disorder/classifying-eating-disorders/dsm-5. 
This is the criteria for eating disorders and a good resource to further understand and even find help.

BingeEatingDisorder,f645t7o,t3_dqffsa,1572688576.0,"An episode of binge eating is associated with three (or more) of the following:

Eating much more rapidly than normal

Eating until feeling uncomfortably full

Eating large amounts of food when not feeling physically hungry

Eating alone because of being embarrassed by how much one is eating

Feeling disgusted with oneself, depressed, or very guilty after overeating

If your consumption of food wasnt associated with these behaviors/emotions, it wasnt a binge, it was just a treat meal. Calories do not determine a binge. I can mindfully eat a very calorie dense meal, and maybe even take a few bites past satiety and that's not be a binge. I can eat a whole bag of raw broccoli in secret, very fast, and feeling disgusted with myself after and that would be a binge.

Honestly I havent told my boyfriend because I'm afraid he's not going to know what to say and pretend like it's not happening OR he won't want to be with someone who does that. 
When I confessed to my sister she asked me to promise her I'd never do that again and when I told her I can't promise that she said if I do it again she's going to ""chew my ass out"". My sister and your bf seem to be at the same level of understanding. 
I know I'm not helping really, I just empathize with you. When my bf spends the night and I restricted all day, then eat a ""normal"" dinner in front of him I litterally count the minutes until he falls asleep so I can go binge. I'm sure he'd be so freaked out knowing that. 
My best BN advice, and terriable relationship advice would be to no longer talk to him about it. Me and my sister have a don't ask don't tell sort of thing going on.

If the answers are no, no and no. That isn't binge eating. If you lose control, eat super fast, feel shame afterwards, but don't necessarily eat until your sick, that still qualifies as binge eating. 
There has been times where I restricted all day and ate handfuls of dry cereal back to back really fast, in secret, and felt bad about it after the fact. But since it was cereal and I was super hungry, I didn't necessarily eat to the point of discomfort. It was still a binge.

Also, there is a type of non purging bulimia which is sounds like you may have this. Compensatory methods following a binge that doesnt include throwing up, but extreme restricting or fasting, is a type of bulimia. 
I totally think you need to see a therapist, and they may want you to also see a dietetian to help teach you to eat properly again, but if you don't think this is possible right now then try this:
Try to eat proper meals at schedualed times. 
Binging is a result if restricting and I think you are feasting because you are putting your body into famine mode. If you teach your body that 400 calories will be available at 7 am, 500 will be available 11:30, 200 at 3:30 pm, 500 at 7, and 200 at 9 pm (or whatever your calorie needs and practical times would be) your body will not crave binges anymore. You just have to be very strict with the scheduale in the beginning because you still may get urges. But that's all they are- urges. They can't make you do anything. 
Just try your best to get enough calories at schedualed times and that should help. 
In the meantime I hope you find a way to get your parents to understand. That is definitely unfortunate but something many people struggle with (loved ones not getting it).

BingeEatingDisorder,f4qx5vw,t3_dliijl,1571759453.0,"Hello! 
Dietetian here and binge eater (technically bulimia). 
I absolutely support you doing what's best for your self esteem and body but from experience and nutrition knowledge I don't recommend your method. 
Sugar can cause inflamation so that may not help your bloat. 
Diet soda has artificial sugar in it which may cause you to crave sugar. 
Also, binging is/can be a result of restricting. If you don't give your body any nourishment today besides a bit of sugar you may be setting yourself up for a binge tonight/all day tomorrow. 
My recommendation to you is drink a lot of water, coffee is fine but dont over do it, to flush that sodium out. Eating potassium helps with bloat too. Bananas, dairy, tomatoes. 
I'd say just eat very little salt today, try some fruits and veggies for potassium, maybe some plain yogurt with fruits for potassium and protein, and drink a ton of water. I bet you would lose a solid 2 or 3 pounds of water weight by tomorrow doing this. 
(Two nights ago I binged on salty pretzels and peanutbutter until I was almost sick. Yesterday I followed the advice I just gave you, and ate a ""normal dinner"" so I wouldn't be tempted to binge last night, and I was down about 3 pounds this morning from yesterday. It was all water weight, but I know the water and bananas helped!) 
Whatever you choose to do I sure hope it helps and you are successful. I've just been in this cycle for so long and methods you listed never ever set me up for success. 
I wish you the best!"
