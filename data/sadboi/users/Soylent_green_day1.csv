BPD,fompy3f,t3_g87vpj,1587899572.0,"I relate to this and I'm not quite sure what caused it. One possible explanation is the way I was raised and the subliminal messaging, if you will, around sexuality and the role of women in sexual relations. 

As a good and obedient child I used to listen to bible readings very carefully. Women in the bible are raped and taken by men fairly often. Women rarely have any say in the matter. I believed this was the faith of womanhood. 

On top of that society, and my mother, tell women they are responsible for sexual virtue. We are to remain virgins to be considered pure and innocent. Also my sex ed compaired women to objects. Reinforcing the idea that I am something to be taken for someones enjoyment at some point. If I were to let that happen, I will be a bad person. Hence the hypervigilance. 

Then, in turn, what is the role of men? The message that settled itself in my brain was that all men want sex, take sex if they want it, are not responsible for consequences. 

I believed this and behaved accordingly until my mid thirties. 

TL:DR; upbringing defined women as victims and guardians."

I only have a very shallow understanding of this theory, but I think according to this theory the idea of living according to draconian laws is wrong. In answer to your question why god would create humans, it would not be to restrict them in such a way that they would be prisoners of sorts, but to enjoy gods creation during their restricted time on it.

However, in order to enjoy this creation human beings must be presented with suffering as well and (or subsequently) be presented with opportunities to do good and evil. A good child will behave as their parent tought them, not out of fear of punishment. The latter would make god a weak god. Human because would do good bc their parent tought them well. A bad child will do evil and will never see or admit their error."
exchristian,fn5v099,t3_fzk509,1586676848.0,"I'm gonna go with the the god-as-a-parent-theory (by Richard Swinburne).

If we consider any god to be omnipotent in need of perfect worshippers, surely a god would conjure them up themselves.

It would expressingly NOT be the *purpose* of human beings to worship and praise god, but to go about their business of living their lives, knowing they have loving a parent.

Writing this, the true meaning of that story about the talents finally hits me. Three brothers get talents from their father and have to return them to their father at some point. The brother who gets the most amount of praise is the one who gets the most out of life, not the one who returns the talents in pristine condition. (Sorry for potato English).

There's always someone with enough charisma and a weird story that people want to believe. There must be a moral to the story! And POOF there's another bible story to be spoon fed. Floods, disease, and buildings falling apart.

Not to worry though,  it's as popular a way of reasoning now as is it was thousands of years ago."

I told them I felt safe if my friends don't show too much care, don't text much, keep their distance, don't pry, but I can still tell them how I feel and they show empathy, but they don't try to console me and let me go about my business even if it meant self harm or worse. My therapist told me this looked like the opposite of safe; pop up once or twice and then have nobody come near you."

I'm de-cluttering constantly. It's driving me bonkers. Too much clutter, trash, stuff. Why do I even have this thing? Why can't I part with it? I shouldn't be attached to anything. I have this feeling I have to be ready to move house at any given time and I am not. It's a general feeling of uneasiness and sometimes a full blown panic attack."

Fast forward 40 years, she still does that. 

When I was 12 I heard my parents talk about a neighbourhood kid dying from brain aneurysm or something. I envied that kid then and I still do in a way."

It finally hit me! You're absolutely right about being justified by others; I lost my brother and I am heartbroken about it. People understand that grief, even if it has been years. Apparently you need to be able to ascertain a relatable cause for your emotion."
BPD,flzxa9u,t3_frzay2,1585636617.0,"Maybe it's about confidence, but about perspective. If done within limits, it means that the people you are with, accept and respect you for who you are. They see you as a whole person and know some of your flaws and don't care about it. They even like it. Jokingly pointing them out, actually gives us a better image of ourselves. 

Some of my co-workers jokingly trash on each other and on me as a sign of endearment and acceptance. Admittedly there is a thin line between what is acceptable and what is not."

I get why she doesn't allow herself any mistakes in her job. It's because she feels she's faulty as a human being. No amount of perfect work deliverd will ever make up for that. Other people's stupidity is only frustrating. 

How is it that other people can be whole as a person and make mistakes at the same time? How can they be happy? How can the live with themselves?"

Accurate. Until my therapist pointed this out this out, I thought this was normal behaviour. I thought I had many friends but in fact I was just friendly towards many people. As a matter of fact, I don't trust anybody (or it takes at least three years of me deciding if someone is okay to be with).

My world is indeed very small and I feel very lonley. Maybe it's too late for me, but you are still young. I hope you will be able to learn what triggers you, workt throught it, communicate about it and find people you trust and feel comfortable with."

My dreams are extremely violent towards myself. Mostly of a tortuous nature (please correct if this is not the right word for torture). I used to think of them as nightmares but they aren't. Sometimes it's....idk...necessary? Like you, I'm trying to wrap my head head around why these thoughts occur. Is it some out of focus way of what I think I deserve as punishment?"
BPD,flk54k2,t3_fpbf67,1585234119.0,"Sorry for potato English in advance, but here's my two cents. I too am attached to some of my belongings in a special way. It's because they somehow belong to my identity. Those items are not one of a kind, but I have chosen these items without influence from or manipulation by anyone. So these items must represent the true me that gets lost so often. A lot of things I own belong to a past self that no longer exists. Or I bought them while I was pleasing someone else's taste, if you know what I mean.  

Also, I'm going to look up worms on a string. ;)"

BPD,fkwyckf,t3_fl45m3,1584611316.0,"Cancellation of therapy has been very stressful for me too! It left me shaking as a leave. We briefly spoke on the phone, but I had no idea what to say. On the other hand, it's something my therapist is new at too, so maybe we should give it time to evolve, to both be comfortable. 

I try to look at it as if therapist is on holiday when I don't see them for weeks either. Maybe you've gone through that too. Keeping a journal helps. What are issues that come up and I need to talk about when therapy resumes? Checking this community helps a lot. 

I truly hope we can be there for each other even more, now that therapy is not an option."
BPD,fkwx7ja,t3_fl3xn1,1584609857.0,">The thing is that I know how I work. I always end up hating people I'm close to.

I really don't want this to happen this time but I don't know what to do<

All my relationships follow a similar pattern eventhough I don't lash out. I just end the relationship. So of course that happened with my therapist as well. It's crucial to understand why and how this happens. The only way to figure out why this happens is focussing on this vicious cycle while it happens. 

Feel what you feel. Talk through it with you therapist. She's on your side even if you tell her how you feel about her."

BPD,fkgwdpr,t3_ficqjy,1584177599.0,"(Please forgive potato English) You describe a very sad situation, actually. So from my point of view your sadness isn't unprovoked. I'm sorry you feel this way. 

I relate to being overwhelmed suddenly. Our offices close during some holiday and because work is the only thing I've got, I feel tossed out each and every time. I have nowhere to go and no one to be with. Our offices are now locked down and I know it will hit me very hard. 

I get that there are preceeding signs and feelings; emotions go from 0 to 10 and they start somewhere. It takes a microscope to identify when and why an emotion was at 3 and when it went from 3 to 4 (from being disappointed to being hurt, to grieving, for instance). Perhaps we are already at a baseline of 5 (feeling lonely) on that scale and it doesn't take much to feel abandoned, then meaningless, and subsequently, overwhelmingly depressed. 

Hope you'll be well."
