I was there and supportive and listened, even when I thought she had it better than most- better than me in many ways. She just talked over me, whined non stop. It would have been ok, because we all have down seasons...

EXCEPT.. When I had a hard time, when both my parents got cancer at the same time, I was working three jobs and going back and forth from school to home to help with my parents AND support my child alone- she just didn't want to hear it. I had nobody to talk to because she was still just talking about herself.

I was done."

I was also involved with a man who beat me daily. He never called me by name. He referred to me as: ""bitch, piss, shit, or garbage."" There were times he beat me so badly or choked me until I woke up seizing. Some days, I got locked into a room and he would let me out when he felt like feeding me, raping me, or beating me.

There were two bottles of Tylenol PM in the bathroom. I took all 180 of them. I felt really calm about it. Afterwards, I remember not wanting to throw them up, so I made myself a sandwich. In a rare moment of kindness, I made my significant other a sandwich too. I guess that's when he noticed something was up. He saw a pill on the floor, and asked if I took anything. I denied it, but I was fading out. He starting screaming at me - he was afraid that someone would think he killed me. He dropped me off at the hospital entrance, from what I hear. I had blacked out at that time.

The next thing I remember is a voice calling my name saying ""Do you know where you are?"" I distinctly remember asking ""Am I dead?"" I wasn't. I was just in the ICU. I stayed there for weeks.

It turns out I didn't really want to be dead. I just hated my life, yo. It was time for me to make some real changes."

But here's a message from our mayor regarding covid-19. This letter was not given to the public. I included her email!!!

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Sorry in advance for the long email but I wanted to help get some accurate information out to all of our residents. I am trying to keep everyone informed and educated. Additionally, I want to let you know how much I care about our amazing community and the work that is taking place to keep people safe. 

 

I have received a number of questions related to the processes and procedures in place for our medical facilities here in Cedar city and in the event that someone needs to receive a coronavirus test. Below you will find some resources and hopefully some answers to questions you may have. As always if you have medical concerns contact your provider about any specific questions. 

 

￼ Cedar City Hospital

 

1-New, strict visitor restrictions are in place. 

 

CLINICS: 

If you are coming to the clinic, you can bring one person with you. We realize this presents a challenge for a young parent without available child care. Please do all you can to make arrangements for your other children to be watched while you or your sick child comes to the clinics for care. 

 

HOSPITALS:

For the hospital, no visitors are allowed, except for these exceptions: 

 

Two visitors allowed only for:

• Obstetric patients — one partner, one birth support person

• Well-Baby patients — may have both parents present

• End-of-life patients

 

One visitor allowed only for:

• Minors under age 18 — one visitor or guardian per day

• Patients with disruptive behaviors or altered mental status

(where caregiver provides safety/information)

• Patients undergoing surgery or procedures — one visitor

who must leave the hospital as soon as reasonable after

the procedure

• Patients who have an appointment at a hospital-based

clinic, laboratory or radiology department, or visiting the

Emergency Department

• Patients at admission and discharge

 

2-You need to check in with the greeters at each entrance to the hospital.  They will ask you questions like if you have been or are sick, have traveled, and/or if you have an appointment. Then they will insist you put on hand sanitizer. Please be supportive and kind to these greeters and also, put on the hand sanitizer. They are doing an important job, and while it may be a little different process entering the hospital than what you’re used to, the greeters are trying to best limit germ spread. Vigilant hand hygiene, as well as preventing non-essential visitors from entering the hospital, absolutely stops the spread of harmful germs. You may also be asked to wear a mask depending on your illness and circumstances. 

 

3-Any visitor with respiratory illness will not be allowed to visit patients. This applies to visitors ONLY, not to patients or those seeking care. 

 

4-Cedar City Hospital has not been, nor are we, overwhelmed or overrun with patients. The hospital is providing care to every single person that comes to the hospital in need, and will continue to do so. 

 

5-Any possible patient who may end up testing positive for COVID-19 will be announced by the Southwest Utah Public Health Department, working with the Utah Department of Health. The health department is the correct source and lead agency on announcements regarding COVID-19.

 

6-The process to get tested for COVID-19 is this: You visit with your own medical provider (or Intermountain ConnectCare on your phone if you want to stay home). If they determine you need to be tested for COVID-19, the provider will take a sample. Those visiting a provider on ConnectCare will go to the local InstaCare on Sage Dr., and the nurse will come get a sample while you’re in your car, so you don’t have to go inside the building. You can also call the COVID-19 Hotline at 844-442-5224 if you have mild to moderate symptoms, available 24/7. A healthcare professional will assess your risk for COVID-19. If testing is needed, a medical order will be provided and you'll be directed to a testing site.

 

The sample process is the exact same one as testing for the flu. They will use the long stick with a cotton swab on the end, and simply swab the back of your nasal cavity. That sample is then sent to a testing center in Salt Lake, and determining results can take some time, even a few days depending on how many samples are coming in.

 

7-Please view and treat your response and prevention to COVID-19 like you would the flu (influenza). This is not a time for fear and panic in any way. It’s a time to stay focused on the truth and the truth is, the measures our entire nation is taking to slow the spread, is a positive and important coming together to help protect our most vulnerable to COVID-19, which are the elderly and immunocompromised. These actions, while disruptive, are to help prevent the overwhelming of healthcare resources with too many getting COVID-19 at the same time. The bold social distancing and robust hand hygiene should correctly be viewed as highly protective and proactive measures. 

 

Thank you for the wonderful coming together in our community to help slow the spread and flatten the curve of COVID-19.

When I started to gain because of a medical condition and depression from losing a child, he was ready to file for divorce.  That defined me for years.

I'm 40 now, and it's hard not thinking back to those days of being thin and taut and gravity agreeing with me.

But I'm wiser, and kinder to myself and others, I find value and worth in myself no matter what I eat or weigh."
AskWomen,fl0kzg9,t3_floj14,1584709517.0,"We can get ourselves off way better than you can, for the most part. 

So, don't rely on ""good sex"" to keep a relationship going. 

If you're not: kind, respectful, engaging, and can't meet up with us on an intellectual level, we could care less about the sex."

AskReddit,fl0juzc,t3_flntei,1584708644.0,"Another pandemic of rotovirus occurring at the same time. All of us free-shitting due to lack of toilet paper. The irresponsible ones are wiping with ""flushable wipes."" Sewer systems begin to back up, giant fatbergs are formed and there is literally diseased shit running down the streets, no handsoap, no toilet paper, and fresh fucking produce is the only thing to eat- thus keeping our stools loose and watery."

This is the case for many women, I think."
exmormon,fl0j7m9,t1_fl00djk,1584708108.0,"Same, sealed at 15. You'd think your parents would at least say ""hey, so this Temple thing we have been building up since you were eight..."" 

""We can't tell you much, but it's closer to Halloween than a spiritual experience""

It was at that moment- being sealed to my parents that I thought ""this is horseshit!"""

AskWomen,fkw1ns8,t3_fko3c9,1584581433.0,"Low fucking self worth.

And the psychotic need to fulfill my own schemas of ""I'm worthless, trash, garbage"".

After years of that, that's sort of all you're used to or think I'd out there."
