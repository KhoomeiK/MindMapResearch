Not everyone is a liar or out to deceive you. They're not really lying if they speak what they believe is true. Until you have a valid reason to assume they are lying you might as well consider their words to be true. 

Also, beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Just because you don't think you're cute or smart it doesn't mean others feel the same. The next time someone compliments you, instead of thinking they're lying, ask them in what way they find you cute/smart etc. They may surprise you."

We'll probably have to wait at least a year until a vaccine is in full scale production. Until then the goal is to minimize the spread of the disease, which of course means minimizing interaction between people. A way of doing this is to isolate oneself voluntarily and to avoid human contact unless absolutely necessary.

Staying isolated does of course not mean you can't be social. Maybe not as much in person, but one definitely can over the web. The isolation is being rough for a lot of people, but we're all in this together."

Even if you do fall short it's only human. It may not be beneficial but it also doesn't necessarily make you a bad mother. I'm not a parent but I do know that the mere act of trying is the most important part.

There are a few steps you can take in terms in aiding of protection from the virus. Keeping good hygiene is a start, such as washing your hands often, especially after touching publicly used items or surfaces. Also avoid touching your face, shaking hands and other forms of physical contact. Avoid larger gatherings/isolated spaces(such as public transport) if possible and try to stay a fair distance away from other people on the street. Do not travel abroad for the foreseeable future!

If you have gloves or mittens it may be a good idea to use them in public so you don't have to touch as many publicly used surfaces or items with your bare hands.

As for preparations in form of food. Buying food that lasts long such as canned food is a good idea should you have to quarantine yourself, but just buy enough for 2-3 weeks. Any more than that is most likely not needed.

Hoarding will do more harm to society than it will benefit the individual. We're all in this together and hoarding only means other people will do less well and have to be outside more(to find supplies and food) which increases the chances of them coming in contact with a sick person.

It's not only food though, it goes for other stuff too such as medicine, water, gasoline etc. And of course toilet paper, as oddly enough many people seem to stockpile at the moment for no reason at all. You can buy things such as water of course, but it's very unlikely that you'd not have running water, or even electricity.

If you have important medicines you need then it may be a good idea to renew and fill those prescriptions ASAP so you have them should you need to be quarantined.

If you happen to show [symptoms](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html) of COVID-19 then do not go outside or to the emergency room. Call your local non-emergency number for healthcare and advice and ask for instructions. This is to prevent the spread of the disease, so it's very important.

Pretty much the only sources you can trust now are official ones such as [WHO](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019) and [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/index.html). There's a lot of misinformation going around at the moment. If you happen to be American(even if not), I wouldn't listen to that clown of a president. Misinformation is more of a threat than any virus, because nobody benefits from panic or wishful thinking.

There isn't a cure yet(contrary to certain self-absorbed idiots), but it's being worked at. How long we have to wait before it's ready for mass production can only be guessed. My estimate is at least a year/year and a half. Human trials are [expected](https://time.com/5790545/first-covid-19-vaccine/) to start next month(April) though. Hopefully all goes well. Hopefully the post was of some use.

I do not recommend that you self harm, but I will also say that you shouldn't let others potential judgment keep you from doing whatever you want(aside from harming yourself or others).

It's good that you are working because having something to do every day will help manage your depression amongst other issues, such as sleep patterns.

Whatever you do, do not neglect your sleep. I've been there many times and it's almost never worth it. There's just too many downsides and barely any upsides. Making sure you get regular sleep and up to 8 hours a night is important for your brain to function well and for your body to get the rest it needs.

It sounds like you have a lot on your table. Maybe you should work on prioritizing that which is necessary and then that which makes you the most happy, whatever that may be. 

Medication can help with depression, but it's it's important to know it's not a fix. It acts like a crutch, making things a little bit easier, but you still have to take the steps yourself. Maybe it's an option for you. Localizing exactly what caused or is causing your depression means you can start dealing with it in therapy. This is typically something a therapist will be able to help you with. Antidepressants and therapy are usually combined.

I can tell you this. Having something to do each day will help managing your depression, as long as that thing makes you feel good about yourself and not very stressed. Maybe you can go back to work when you feel ready but lessen your workload. It'd give you something to do, help with providing and also give you some free time to figure out how to best deal with your depression.

Have an appointment soon which I don't look forward to, but have to make it since the issues are causing pain and are likely to get worse the longer I wait.

Still feel empty in a way, very much indifferent as usual. I'm not sure what sucks more, the loneliness or the fact that I feel like I struggle with verbal communication due to having been socially isolated more than I've been social in the last decade.

I just want to go to sleep right now, to feel the comfort of the bed, but a small part of me knows that I need to stay awake to fix my sleep. Though another part don't see much point in it anymore since I do the same thing day in an day out, which is nothing, and it's not helping me at all. I don't have the will to do anything else. Sleeping seems like a good option.

I'm tired but too tired to do something about it, if that makes any sense. I don't want to die or be lonely anymore but I'm not sure if I have the will to live. I'm not even sure if I'm depressed anymore or if it's something else. I suffer from functional issues of the mental kind. I simply cannot bring myself to get anything done until it's absolutely necessary.

Of late I've thought about if it were better if I were a drone like many other people, just going about the day doing stuff and being somewhat productive as a result. At least things would get done that way. Made me think of certain illicit drugs like coke that'd make you goal oriented and help you feel good about doing literally anything. Though I have no interest in ruining my life further. Then I thought about if there are any legal drugs with similar effects.

Currently I really can't think of another way to motivate me to get things done, because I think that's where my problem lies. It's not that I lack the knowledge to improve my situation, but that I lack motivation, willpower and discipline. Things I've lost through years of constant decline in my mental well-being.

I want to be fixed but I don't know how one fixes a person that has stopped caring. Especially since caring is typically required to get things done. If you don't care then you really don't see a point in doing things. Everything for the most part is just devalued. This is where I feel I am at the moment."

Once you have routines, start doing new things until you find something you like. Then use it as a way to socialize.

I too struggle with many things you've described. I'm about your age and single, have no friends outside of the Internet. I don't have any applicable skills to survive in the job market, but I am, no pun intended, working on changing this. One difference is that I do live on my own.

Even the slightest breeze caused pain. It's similar but way worse than biting down on ice cream and feeling that chill going through your teeth.

Since then and other dental issues, I brush every day. I would recommend getting an electric toothbrush since it reaches everywhere much easier, and to not forget to brush all sides of the teeth including the gums too.

As for deism. God is just as likely to exist as any other mythological creature. There's just as much evidence of either.

How that happens depends on who you are as a person. Many people find coping methods to deal with mental illness. Mental well-being are for many a roller coaster where you'll have peaks and dips. Having someone or something to lean on for help goes a long way in making the dips less impacting on your mental well-being.

Whether it's hobbies, family, friend or SO's etc depends entirely on you. Medicine may help too but on its own it's pretty useless unless combined with some social factors. It's why therapy is often recommended in addition to medication. Generally speaking we are social animals so having someone to help us through tough times is typically desirable.

One big problem with depression is that it can only become better if you make an effort to make it better. Nobody can sadly do this for you. This is a problem because depression can be paralyzing and cause you to not care and therefor not get anything done. It's a real motivation killer for a lot of people. Many have routines to fall back on which ensures their survival, should they not be able to get help from friends, family or the government.

Opening up to someone you trust may be a good first step to get you talking about what's bothering you in life and how to potentially aid your recovery.

I too struggle with the most basic of things. I can't bring myself to have any routines at all because I lack the willpower to do it. I also lack discipline. I have a roof over my head, food to eat and help when I need it, but even so I can't bring myself to do the things that improve my life and keeps me healthy. I also don't feel joy as I used to, that's very normal with depression.

Since you're still educating yourself you'd most likely have access to a school councilor or nurse. I'd suggest talking to them about your issues. It helps if the school is aware of it in case your education suffers due to your depression. They typically have the resources to help or aim you in the right direction to get the help you need."

You'll encounter plenty of people like this in life so all you can do is learn to live with it and confront/avoid when possible, whatever makes you feel better. I'd recommend not using social media at all when you feel at your worse, especially if you find yourself comparing your life to other people. You're living life at your own pace and have nothing to prove to anyone but yourself.

Social media can be pretty toxic and may not even reflect reality at all. Many lie on there for validation. People who treat others like dirt will eventually mess with the wrong person and that day karma sure is a bitch. I've known assholes but I do not follow their lives nor do I care.

Anyhow, if you let assholes get to you then they win. Preferably you beat them by being a better person, not outachieving them. Of course you can also beat them by being a worse person but that typically comes at too high a cost. I've wasted enough time dealing with assholes and I'm not wasting any more."

I do not have ADD as far as I know of. I typically remember stuff that's interesting though, so at least I have that going for me.

I also have a bad perception of time, probably because I've gradually stopped caring about things for over a decade. I guess it makes sense that if you're not making an effort you're not going to remember anything. It sucks.

depression,f2b65k7,t3_dcolpu,1570122295.0,"Even if showering is hard, always brush your teeth every day. Invest in an electric toothbrush to get most of the bacteria that may be hiding between your teeth that a normal toothbrush can't easily get to. Don't forget to brush your gums too.

Having dealt with poor dental hygiene I'll tell you that dental pain is one of the worst pains there is. Every time you eat and deal with hot or cold with bad teeth it's going to hurt. If you have an exposed tooth due to eroded gums, it'll hurt every time you breathe from your mouth too, or when you open your mouth if it's windy outside.

The pain can prevent you from sleeping too, even with strong pain medication. Then there's the cost side of things. Even in the most caring of societies dental care can cost you a smaller fortune. It's much cheaper to buy an electric toothbrush for like $20-30 and replace the heads when needed than to pay hundreds to thousands of dollars on dental care and pain medication.

Currently I'm working on flossing more often. If your gums bleed it's because you haven't flossed in a good while. Preferably you'd brush your teeth twice a day but even one time a day is better than none. Always brush and floss before bedtime and always brush if you're heading out somewhere. Adopting such a routine will keep your teeth as healthy 'as they can be' and not only will your oral hygiene be better, but your dentist will be glad too.

Diabetes is a serious condition and you should really listen to your doctor when they give you instructions or advice. Diabetes can lead to a lot of internal problems in your body, as well as external ones. You can lose your sight, get organ damage and also risk having your limbs amputated. It'll eventually lead to death if left ignored.

If you are going to use food as source for comfort then try to limit it to healthy food. Fruit, dried or fresh, nuts, berries etc are all good choices. Avoid as much sugar as possible since this will just worsen your condition. But even so it's eventually going to damage your body unless you exercise regularly.

Maybe you can make some new friends while working out. It'll help you motivate yourself to exercise since you're not just exercising, but you're meeting up with friends. If you like music, then exercise with music on. Doesn't have to be in a gym, it can be simple walks. Swimming is a great option if walks are too difficult.

The only motivation I can give other than what I wrote above is some hard truth. Nothing will happen unless you put your mind to it and make it happen. But once it does happen you're responsible for making it happen. That'd be your achievement!

It's important to see important tasks as a longer road rather than a fix. Being healthy requires constant vigilance against that which worsens our health; such as sitting still for longer periods of time, over-consumption of food, sugar and alcohol, lack of exercise and so on.

Oh, and thinking about the future is good, but it's more important to be mindful of where you are now. Take small but important steps towards a healthier you and focus at your studies. Worry about what you want to do after college once all exams are done."

Don't have the will to find a source for this atm but read about it a few years ago.

It's also worth noting that many people experience vision problems as a result of aging, but it typically don't happen until the mid 60's or so.

You should consult an ophthalmologist. A normal doctor should however be able to determine whether you need more specialized care. There's a good chance you'll need glasses.

depression,f28dgxt,t1_f27jmsq,1570058750.0,"Objectively speaking life has purpose and that is to live long enough to procreate and for us humans to pass on useful knowledge to the next generation.

Meaning is however not that straight forward since it's very individual. What makes life meaningful to one person may not work for another and vice versa. In the end we have to create our own meaning. It won't fall in our laps. However there are some good news. Typically this meaning sort of weasels its way into our lives where we get the opportunity to grab it, or not. For some it's family like a partner or perhaps even children, for others it tied to their work. In essence I think most of the meaning people find in life is tied to some form of responsibility. Author and clinical psychologist Jordan Peterson has talked a bit about this(whatever one may personally think of him, he has some valid points on the subject). It may be responsibility towards yourself, others or society in general.

I currently lack meaning in my life and it sure doesn't help my mental well-being. But I do realize that unless I take steps to try to look for it, I'll never find it. A good start I think is to find something you're passionate about and see if you can make it into a career. That way it's not just work, but something you look forward to each day. It'll help increase your overall health and happiness too since to have a career you also need healthy routines.

Life may often seem meaningless, but that doesn't mean it is. Think of it like this. If you currently lack meaning it doesn't mean you have none, it means you just haven't found it yet. So keep looking and who knows, maybe you'll find another person to share that meaning with and to add additional meaning into you life."

Some people seem to think that the inability to do something is tied to the difficulty. It's really not when we talk about the mentally ill.

I don't need to be told that it's easy to do the laundry, vacuum or check the mail. I already know it's easy and I let them know. If I knew how to get past this mental barrier I would. But for now I have to live with it and rely on the motivation that comes when I have no clean clothes, no food in the fridge or when the floor looks like I've not dusted for 3 months. And then do the laundry, grocery shop and clean my place.

I wish more people realized that depression and other mental illnesses aren't as straight forward as just doing things, hanging in there and 'manning up' as some seem to think.

May have something to do with me finally stepping up and actually doing something right rather than just thinking people should know better. So story time!

A few days ago some idiot committed a crime right in front of me. It was littering, something which bothers me immensely. He did it on purpose too, not by mistake. He checked the bushes then simply threw it. It's not hard to pick up your shit after yourself and carry it until you find a bin, which are everywhere in my town. Confronted the guy and he was with two friends. Conversation basically went like this:

Me yelling from cross the street at the bus stop I'm waiting(them standing on the opposite side also waiting for the bus going in the other direction): Do you know what the annual cleaning costs are?

Litterer: No

Me: I cite a rough figure in the hundreds of millions of Euro, then I say: pick up your shit after yourself.

The guy doesn't care so I think for 10 seconds and decides to walk over the street to him so we can have a conversation about this. Maybe he just doesn't know it's illegal or the implications?

Me: Pick up the trash you just threw in the bushes.

Litterer: Why?

Me: Because I'm asking you politely. Don't you care about society?

Litterer: Says something inaudible

Didn't care to ask them to repeat themselves so I just shrug.

Me: You know it's illegal to litter and there's a 75 Euro fine for doing so. Pick up your trash. He says nothing. I ask which bus he's taking(i already know since there's only one bus going on that line, but I wanted to put him on the spot). I walk up to the pole and check the time table.

Me: The cops can probably be here before your bus arrives.

Litterer: My dad is a cop, I can call him.

Me: Do so then.

He seemed a bit surprised of my reaction. I think to myself that if his dad really is a cop and he comes down there, I'd go to lengths to make the dad's life difficult too if he ignored the crime just because it's his son. I'm pretty stubborn when it comes to all things injustice.

While walking away a stone throw to make the call he implies he's done way worse things and is actually waiting for what's basically an arraignment. Maybe he thought this was supposed to scare me?

Me 100% fearlessly saying: and what relevance has this?

Litterer proceeds to call the phone, but unsure whether he faked it or not.

I put down my bags and continue to walk away making a non-emergency call. My bags are now closer to them than me. Wasn't intending on doing this on purpose but didn't expect them or anyone else to steal the bags. Thinking that I'd welcome the try just so they'll give me the excuse to escalate it. I'm a bit crazy this way, but I typically don't invite confrontation on purpose. It sometimes happens because people are thoughtless, ignorant and harms others and I just have to tell people not to be; especially when it affects me.

While I confidently put my back away from them they take off, realizing I'm not fucking kidding about calling the cops. I consider following since I can technically perform a citizen's arrest but it's probably not worth the hassle and his friends can just lie about the littering(even if it can technically be proven since his DNA is on the can. but obviously nobody's going to run a DNA test costing more than a litter ticket) and then I'd be faced with assault/battery charges for arresting him. Or more likely him and his friends will try to stop me and I end up getting my ass kicked.

Anyhow, I wanted to get home too so I let it slide. Checked the bushes and the litterer actually did pick up his can. Probably had a similar train of thought about the DNA thing, but who knows. I did not see him pick it up but the can he threw was nowhere to be seen. Was being transferred on phone during this and since they were basically gone I decided to hang up.

These people were adults, or at least looking like it, and with the power of knowledge about what the law actually says(knowing what he did was 100% illegal) and some determination I scared them away. After this I couldn't help to feel sort of empowered. I stood up to what's right and I sort of won in the end.

In anticipation of such responses, yes I know it's not a good idea to confront random people on the street even when they are clearly wrong. Though risk wasn't in my mind at the moment, only to do what's right by society. Hopefully the guy learnt a valuable lesson. I know it's a bit off-topic but I thought it was something worth mentioning since it improved my mood and was probably the reason why I got off my ass today with extra energy to spare.

This story ends here but another incident happened not 5 minutes after I went back over the road waiting for my bus to arrive. A couple goes to the bus stop and proceeds to each light up a cigarette. To clarify, it's illegal to do this on a bus stop in my country. Then they of course proceeds to litter once done. Really hate smokers due to their inconsiderate nature. I don't mind them doing it since free will and all that, but I do mind them potentially harming others and in this case breaking the law and littering.

Considered telling them off too but there weren't anyone else around them so I let it go, even if I really wanted to say something. The smoking ban on bus stops and the like exists to protect other people and while there were no other people around, it's still forbidden on principle. Their bad habits are mimicked by others. It recently became illegal to smoke on bus stops but it has also been all over the news so one would expect them to be aware of this. They probably just didn't care though."

You also avoid failure(and hence letdowns) much easier and tasks seem more achievable when they're split up into many parts rather than one big one.

Whether it's cleaning, cooking or something else you'd start slow and build on it until you're done. If you can do more that's excellent. If you cannot, that's fine too. What's important is to keep on doing and succeeding no matter how small the task may be to others. It's big to you and that's what matters."
depression,eyawn7n,t1_eyatoxz,1566971342.0,"I think you should focus on getting your sleep under control before anything else. Getting uninterrupted sleep for 6-8 hours a night is extremely important for our mental and physical well-being. Not getting quality sleep can actually cause suicidal thoughts. You should ask your doctor to prescribe medication to help you sleep.

If you want to give SSRI's another try, there's a medicine called Mirtazapine. It will put you out like that. The only downside I saw with it was the weight gain(which is common for most SSRI's) and feeling hungover the next day. It takes about an hour or two to work and the hangover I experienced the next day usually goes away after a few hours. It may be different for you though and you may not experience this side effect at all.

As for therapy. Due to your social anxiety, maybe it'd help having the sessions in an environment where you feel safe and content, like at home. I'm sure there are plenty of therapist that'd be able to accommodate your needs. Let me know how it goes."
depression,eyavall,t3_cwg1vi,1566970666.0,"D3 vitamin is good if you miss out on a lot of sunlight. Though before taking vitamins you should consult your physician and probably take blood tests to determine if you lack something specific. After all there's really no point in wasting money on expensive pee.

Keep in mind that vitamins can't and shouldn't be used as a replacement for a healthy and varied diet. It's usually better to eat unhealthier than to not eat at all.

Things you only need to heat, boil or prepare in oven are recommended since you just have to put it in and wait. So you don't have to stand by the stove to cook, just wait. I typically set the timer on my phone to know when it's done while I do other stuff.

Peas, spinach and broccoli offers good nutrition even when frozen and could serve as a meal on it's own. Boiled eggs are also good. If you feel up to it, you can make pasta too. Put the eggs and the pasta in the same pot to save time and then you just have to take out the eggs before the pasta is done. Same works with broccoli and pasta and the boiling time is about the same.

Frozen food in general is a very good option during depressed episodes where you don't get out much or don't eat as you should. Frozen food lasts very long which means you can buy more when you do the grocery shopping and then you don't have to worry about not having anything to eat. So it also lessens the frustration and anxiety of being hungry but not having the energy to go shopping for food.

If you have any questions regarding easy to make food or what I prefer, all you have to do is ask."

depression,eyasswi,t3_cwg6wu,1566969108.0,"Well that sucks, but maybe you can get some reassurances on r/legaladvice with regards to your termination. Getting fired is a temporary setback while suicide is permanent. While you may feel lost and things hopeless, it's not going to be permanent. You will find another job and who knows, maybe you'll like it there too. First priority is to find a new job, then you can start looking for your dream job again. Hang in there."
depression,eyasa8w,t3_cwfvh6,1566968757.0,"Only compare yourself to yourself, not others. Because there will always be someone better no matter how you look at it. Comparing yourself to others devalues your achievements and can therefor only end in disappointment.

You may have not got into the school you wanted, but that's fine. The fact that you got into a school at all is something to be proud of. Maybe you can figure out why you got denied and change your approach to things and reapply to your top choices. Chances are there may be a dropout or two and that you can take their place.

Don't just send them a letter or an e-mail, visit them if possible. It's much easier to overlook, ignore or not take seriously a letter or an e-mail than it is in person. You may not get your way or know why you got denied, but at least you would've tried.

That alone may bring some closure to it and help you focus on where you are now and what you got. Because that's the most important after all, to appreciate and focus at what you have and where you are, not at what you don't have and where you're not.

I'm not sure if I'm making much sense ATM since I'm about ready to go to bed, but I took the time to make a last post since you obviously need some reassurance and perspective. Hope it helped."

depression,eyaqgms,t3_cml6ni,1566967612.0,"Having poor sleep patterns again. It's morning now and I'm getting ready for bed. Feels like I haven't showered or changed clothes in a week, but it's probably longer. Going to have to shower today since I have obligations tomorrow. Pretty hungry but eating has to wait until I wake up. Been lurking here a bit trying to be useful by helping others.

Have a few appointments coming up, one of which I should somewhat look forward to but I don't really feel anything specific about it. May eventually help me get on a path to a job though, but that's way later down the line. Don't really have any expectations.

Also visited my father recently and it was nice. I keep promising myself to get better at keeping in touch with family but I either forget or don't have the energy to do so. I have really bad concept of passage of time sometimes. Days become weeks and weeks become months too quickly that days sort of blend together. I'm far too isolated.

At least I haven't missed taking my meds for over a week. Going to see about upping my dosage since I'm currently not seeing the results I want."

Put on your favorite music on a low volume and lay down in bed and try to relax. Focus on your breathing and count one for slowly breathing in and two for slowly breathing out. As you breathe in, visualize light filling your body. As you breathe out, visualize your worries in physical form fading away like steam in the air."

While some problems takes effort to solve, many will sort themselves out along the way. You're balancing a lot of balls so give yourself some credit too when things go well and celebrate the small accomplishments along the way. I'm sure your daughter thinks you're doing the best you can even if you don't feel it."

You're in a relationship, that's not something a lot of depressive people could say. I wish I had someone to love and to feel loved in return. If you love this girl, then use her as your motivation to turn things around to the person you want to be.

You've also finished your main education and is eligible for college. That's more than I ever did with my studies. I have yet to finish my secondary education, or high school equivalence(age 14/15-18) due to mental health issues.

Schedule your calls to your grandma and do your best to keep them. Let her know that you have issues you are working on but you will try to maintain contact.

As for paying for your mom. If you live at home I get that, but if you don't then it's frankly not your problem even if that may sound cold. Family is important but you are more important. Don't let the issues of others weigh you down.

Look for a job that's more your speed. There are plenty of jobs where you may not have to deal with people, if that's what causing the stress. Or jobs that aren't physically exhaustive should that be the issue.

As for your self harm issues, I really do urge you to seek professional help for this. You need to address this in order to start feeling better. As for keeping promises, start with something smaller and work yourself up.

You didn't waste my time at all, I'm happy to reply. You seem to need someone to talk to."
depression,eyafhiv,t3_cwetjh,1566962621.0,"As I understand your situation you will soon no longer be able to live there?

Contact the IRS and ask how to proceed and how long you can still live there and/or if you can continue to live there as long as you're paying them rent. Then start look for new places immediately regardless of outcome just to be on the safe side.

[This link](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/dhs/prevention/rent-issues.page) may be of some help to you. If your roommate isn't aware of this issue yet then now(during daylight hours) would be a good idea to tell her. You need to get ahead of the problem before it grows bigger. It'd offer you some relief having more information and knowing what your options are.

It's OK to be scared. Drastic and unsure situations that affects living situations tends to scare most people. I still remember the moment when I thought I was about to become homeless. It worked out though since I had family to rely on. Maybe this is an option for you as well, should you not be able to find accommodations in time.

depression,eyac4x8,t3_cwevjn,1566961250.0,So what's weighing on your mind?
depression,eyabpb4,t3_cwehkm,1566961065.0,"Sure it is possible to catch up.

The first thing you need to do if you haven't already is call those you owe money, I assume various companies and not private persons. This can't wait. Then agree with them upon a payment plan that works for you. Making a budget first to see how much money you will have left after each month is probably a good idea. Maybe you can gather your debts in one place to make paying easier. Then you just have to keep making regular payments until you're debt free.

If you cannot pay one month for whatever reason, make sure you call them and let them know this. They want their money and since you would've made the effort to call, they're likely to give you more time or perhaps even alter your payment plan since times are rougher. All of this would be to reduce stress on your part.

Selling things you don't necessary need to survive is a good way to earn some money, but you also have to balance it so you don't sell things that help you cope or feel good in your life. If that's your TV, then don't sell the TV. If you have multiple coping methods, such as your TV and computer, maybe you can sell the TV and just have your computer.

Things like canceling subscriptions, choosing a slower Internet connection etc are good ways to save money each month which then is put towards necessities. Maybe you don't need the fastest Internet connection out there, or all those TV channels.

If you own a car and have good bus routes, then maybe sell the car and take the bus instead and save money on not having to maintain, run and pay insurances for your vehicle. Or if you live close to work, buy an old bicycle(and helmet). You'll probably have to come to terms with that you're going to have to give up at least some comforts and freedoms like a vehicle if you want to become debt free anytime soon.

And yes, everything does happen for a reason, it's called cause and effect, action and reaction. Dwelling on it or what could've been won't help you, it will only worsen your mental well-being, but taking positive action will help. So you're in debt and that sucks, but it's not the end of everything and even if it was then you still can only move forward. All we can do is adapt, then learn from our mistakes and try to move on."
