linguistics,fpdshy9,t3_gcv8c7,1588533335.0,"I'm kind of a noob but what I would do is find a way to count what word classes occur in what order. So you can say that a sentence consists of a NP and a VP and a NP can be an Adj + N or Det + N etc and a VP can be a Vi or a VT + N etc so that way you can build possible syntax trees. If you run a count of what word class combinations you get in a sentence (or in a NP and VP) you should end up with the most common ones and you can describe your grammar based on that. Sorry that this is a little simplistic, I'm not a very good linguist but I saw you didn't have any comments. I hope you get some more experienced help."

(although mine was not that bad, it was very cruel). I'm not even sure why I did it because I didn't even really know the girl, I was just utterly convinced that she was a loser and deserved it by these other kids that I thought were really cool I guess. I woke up almost immediately when I found out how upset my best friend was about it. Turns out my best friend was really close to the victim and that girl was already struggling with depression and mental illness and possibly suicidal thoughts.  It gave me a new perspective on the sort of people I should and shouldn't associate with and how little moral discernment I had. I'd do or think anything if the right person told me to. I never owned up to it and I hate myself for it to this day. I hope that girl is okay and that she found better people in her life."
