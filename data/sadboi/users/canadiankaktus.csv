I‚Äôm scared to tell people about my mental illness because I also have no past trauma, I have supporting family and friends etc. I‚Äôm in my mid twenties which everyone talks about those being the best years.... so why do I want to die? It‚Äôs a hard thing to grapple with. I also feel selfish often, and am mad at myself for the way I am. I took a leave from work and I am in therapy now. Something that really helps me is words of affirmation. I practice them every morning and when I feel I need them. Maybe they will help: 

-I am capable and worthy of happiness 
-anything that takes away my power and pleasure makes me a victim, don‚Äôt be a victim. 
-I stand tall and take responsibility of my life. 
-it‚Äôs okay if I don‚Äôt feel better right away, keep working on progress, bad days are okay 
-you are just as deserving of all the wonderful things in life as everyone else. 

I hope this helps! I got these from various self help books (feel the fear and do it anyways Susan Jeffers, full casastrophe living). They have been helpful to me."
