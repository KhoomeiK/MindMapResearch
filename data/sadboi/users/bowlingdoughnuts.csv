xboxone,fppjgv8,t1_fppeo33,1588803408.0,"I have a very different point of view than most other gamers. To me failing and having to reload breaks every literal piece of the games momentum. Dying and reloading isn’t even a real consequence. It’s essentially the same thing as POP2008 except you are told you died and you have to wait to reload, then redo everything to get back to where you were. It means nothing but is an annoyance. 

POP2008 got rid of al annoyances and didn’t actually get there, but showed a version of game design where storytellers and level designers didn’t need to worry about making a game too challenging because there was no annoyance associated with death but rather it was a learning experience where you got to retry and retry until you got it. 

Also level design would be more open and secrets hidden in wild areas. The player wouldn’t be afraid to explore because there was no set back in failing. 

It just almost got there, but didn’t quite get to the finish line. 

I think it was ahead of its time.  Death in games is fake. Maybe dark souls with actually losing experience by dying makes death a real consequence but most games literally annoy you as punishment. That’s my counter argument to the no death complaint lol.

I do think it falls short of showing people it’s genius, but had they of stuck with it the sequel could have been something special. Like assassins creed II or any other sequel to a game with promise."
