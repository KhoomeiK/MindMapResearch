BPD,foq49a3,t1_fnua6ys,1587982446.0,"Hey, sorry for the delayed response, yaknow how bpd is lol. 

Sexual fluidity...fluid...that’s a very good way of putting it! I’ve heard the term used for gender but not so much for sexuality. Definitely a more accurate way to describe how I feel! Thank you so much for responding x"
BPD,foq3rtf,t3_g8jvs5,1587981940.0,"Thank you. Thank you so much for saying this. People’s perceptions of the illness are almost worse than having the illness sometimes. 

I feel this every single day at work. I am a quiet borderline, so it’s not immediately obvious to everyone that something’s up. But my symptoms, especially my social anxiety and my negative moods that make me want to withdraw, make it difficult for me to develop consistent relationships with my coworkers. 

Similarly, I have at lease three coworkers who have autism, and I have noticed many overlaps with the kind of behaviours that autism and BPD cause and I’d say my social awkwardness is pretty much in line with theirs. 

Now here’s the fun bit. A lot of people who work there will go out of their way to start a conversation with these people, check how they’re doing etc. Yet these same people go out of their way to avoid me, and I’ve been told that people view me as rude because I don’t usually try to talk to anyone. 

Of course I’m not the only quiet person to have ever worked there. I’ve heard plenty of (usually older) people like this be described in a positive light- “oh she’s lovely, just gets on with her work, keeps herself to herself”, yet when it comes to me...

As a quiet borderline, I don’t flip out in public; if I get near to it I lock myself in the bathroom for however long it takes for me to get my shit together. I do my best to be friendly, helpful and polite. And the handful of people that make the effort with me see this. But still I can’t seem to shake this image."

A very memorable example of this was when I went to a zoo with my fp and it was my first time seeing a panda irl so he went to buy me a cuddly toy panda, but as I was about to carefully select one he picked one up and then dropped it, it already had a couple of imperfections like a wonky eye and a slightly split seam but I couldn’t bear the thought of returning this lil fuzzy panda to the shelf"

BPD,etiajgw,t1_eti83jb,1562844260.0,"it’s the same for me, with my SO usually being the only person who sees any of the bad stuff. and like someone else said earlier, after acting ‘normal’ all day, home is the only place i can ‘relax’ and ‘be myself’- and by that i mean not eating up all my energy on acting like i don’t have bpd. 

my ex couldn’t get over how “fucked up” it was that the person i cared about the most would be the person i end up ‘treating’ the worst."
