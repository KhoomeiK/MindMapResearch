zoloft,fg4exez,t1_fg3q4k8,1580502170.0,"It’s not placebo. It works by leaving more serotonin in the brain so you feel the difference pretty quickly. For me on day one I was having happy spells and able to control negative thoughts. The 6-8 weeks of side effects sucked. I had bad insomnia for 2 weeks only sleeping 3 hours a night. Loss of appetite that lasted 4-6 weeks. And some other random things I can’t really remember. For me, the first 6 months were great. I felt how I imagined normal people felt. But after those 6 months I kinda became numb. Made a lot of reckless decisions. I stopped taking the meds after a year of being on them. The withdrawals were terrible and I ended up depressed while my brain transitioned but I was still so happy to feel anything after being numb for that long. I realized that anxiety isn’t always a bad thing. There are absolutely good anxieties. Ones that keep you from making half cocked decisions that will come back to bite you in the ass. It got me through a rough time but it’s not a miracle pill. Those pills are training wheels.

A lot of really common sense shit goes over lawmakers heads. NOT TO MENTION jail isn’t rehabilitation.

NoStupidQuestions,fbyr83u,t3_ef58vu,1577224190.0,"“The law was named after Megan Kanka, a 7-year-old girl from New Jersey, who was raped and murdered on July 29, 1994, by her neighbor, 33-year-old Jesse Timmendequas. After luring Megan into his home with the promise of a puppy, Timmendequas raped her, strangled her to death, and dumped her body in a park two miles away. He willingly led police to Megan’s body the next day and confessed. This was the first time Megan’s parents became aware that the man who moved directly across the street from them had not only been convicted twice already for molesting other young girls like Megan, but was living with two roommates who were also registered sex offenders”

My finding shows that when a person “commits lewd acts using force, fear, violence, or duress upon a child under the age of 14, with the intent of arousing or appealing to the sexual desires of that person, and is punishable by 5, 8, or 10 years in prison.” If I’m wrong correct me.

Either way, a child can’t defend themselves. They don’t know any better. They’re preyed on because of their youthfulness not because of who they are as people. Serial killers are repeat offenders who typically have “types” and will get life or death once caught. A child molester has a chance at getting out, mental illness in tact, with their “types” everywhere."

I swear to god if you don’t do this I’m gunna smack the shit out of you in front of all these people.” Idk if it was the constant abuse from this specific guy or all of these types growing up but I LOST it. Stepped up to him yelling in his face inches above mine. Untucked my uniform telling him how prepared I was to lose my god damn job. This whole time he has his hands out in front of him, backing away, apologizing as I keep inching toward him. I grab his merchandise and throw it at him demanding he leave and never come back. He did. And for a year I’d get updates from the staff telling me they still hadn’t seen him. I’ve never felt so corrected in my views of people.

I later read that Beet Root juice is often more effective at lowering blood pressure than medication and occurs usually 3-6 hours after consumption. I loved the performance boost but I can’t deal with that blood pressure drop. Has anyone experienced the same thing? Do you just get used to it or is there a way to avoid the sudden drop?

Edit: I think my wording was confusing. The Beet Root caused a drop in blood pressure about 3-4 hours after consumption that caused light headed feeling and nausea. There’s evidence to support that this happens. My question is if anyone else takes Beet Root, have they experienced the same thing and is this something you get used to as you continue to take it?"

For example, I broke up with my girlfriend of 7 years. Now we had our problems like anyone else would but at the time we were really good. Just that dumb voice of insecurity didnt feel like insecurity anymore. It felt like bravery so I just pulled the trigger without even thinking about it. A year later after I had detoxed myself from the medication I felt so much regret for all the sudden and irrational decisions I made over that year. I messed a lot of things up and have started my life over from lower than I was when I started the meds. BUT i'm mentally stronger and have a plan for myself, working out a TON, and rebuilding my life.

Eyebleach,f2iao18,t1_f2h0mjn,1570254559.0,I once had to jump on and catch an elderly woman who nearly fell down a fast moving escalator. I never considered them to be dangerous before having to do that and being repeatedly and sincerely thanked by the woman and her friend.
