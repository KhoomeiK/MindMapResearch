For me, there's always a 2 week to month long adjustment period where i feel absolutely and hopelessly depressed until the anti depressants kick in and the mood stabilizer stops making me feel like mildly suicidal. 

But the fun doesn't stop there. In addition to long term health ramifications of prolonged usage of the particular mood stabilizer i use there are also sexual side effects, weight gain issues, and an ass load of other shit.

I do what i can to manage my stress levels and work closely with my therapist. I put in a ton of work on self care. I've tracked my mood and behavior for the last 3 years through an app and there's virtually no difference between when I'm on meds and when I'm not. When I'm on meds it makes me numb and miss the things that made me excited, plus there's the litany of aforementioned side effects. When I'm off them i definitely hit some pretty bad lows but i can live with that.
