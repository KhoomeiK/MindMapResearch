microdosing,fmd2fyy,t3_fui7fe,1585957844.0,"Considering the cap itself is black as well, id say it‚Äôs bacteria. With them being dry it shouldn‚Äôt be harmful, I‚Äôd recommend not grinding it up with the others, though. I‚Äôd use it for a tea just to be sure it doesn‚Äôt make you feel extra nauseas."
mentalhealth,fm9vuni,t1_fm8yj9l,1585877731.0,Can you explain what makes it sound like dissociation?
DID,fm9s4tq,t3_fttxbb,1585875332.0,Nothing about DID is normal.
BPD,fm9f3pa,t1_fm8rp5t,1585867438.0,"Well ur more than welcome to comment here :) if not, try r/mental health"
mentalhealth,fm99scx,t1_fm99ky2,1585864446.0,I really relate to this. Can I PM you?
mentalhealth,fm976mk,t1_fm92cn3,1585863011.0,Thanks for your input. I have never even thought of split personalities. I thought there had to be some kind of memory loss or something I really don‚Äôt know anything about it.
BPD,fm8rglc,t1_fm8qvps,1585854639.0,Sorry about that. :/
mentalhealth,fm8r7g7,t3_ftrxle,1585854505.0,"I really wish I had some kind of thoughtful advice to offer. I am also alone in this world. With the exception of a couple people whom I still feel lonely around. It‚Äôs like waiting and waiting for this release. Like a dog trying to break off the chain. It‚Äôs like having TNT in your chest and you‚Äôre just waiting to implode. One wrong movement, one wrong word, ignites this explosion. You‚Äôre not alone with this feeling, I hope we both are fortunate enough to come across actual decent human beings who can teach us how to open up and feel alive again."
LSD,fldyczj,t1_fldy95i,1585074113.0,And sooo much more soothing when u need a safety blanket. Lol!
microdosing,flbw9vx,t1_flbp2x0,1585014083.0,Awesome thank u :)
microdosing,flawar8,t1_flaj2j1,1584992421.0,"Ohhh okay. I bought some off of Etsy, do u think they are legit?"
Nicegirls,fl4xh5s,t1_fiujqs6,1584823754.0,Everyone understands what you mean by ‚Äúbiphobic‚Äù. no one is condoning or being biphobic. read all the other comments if u still don‚Äôt understand.
Nicegirls,fiuinzu,t1_fitt3to,1582742129.0,He‚Äôs saying she would be the type to cheat and blame it on her bisexuality because she‚Äôs quirky and probably not actually bi. Not that anyone who is bi is automatically unfaithful.
BPD,fe5hv6p,t3_eneo5f,1578869622.0,I ask myself this all the time. Seriously
BPD,fcvnwdw,t3_eipevy,1578006162.0,ME TOO I‚Äôm from Tennessee and even teachers at school would demand it!
BPD,fcssijw,t3_eicghg,1577924002.0,I cried when the clock striked midnight. Fear of living through another year set in heavy and deep
relationship_advice,fcsoe73,t3_eilj99,1577921043.0,"You know if someone‚Äôs been in your house. It can be embarrassing to admit when you have invaded someone‚Äôs space and he probably feels it‚Äôs better if you don‚Äôt know and he just gives you your key back. He‚Äôll never admit to it, but if you love him then the friendship should still remain. Just know that you‚Äôll never trust beyond that extent again and that‚Äôs fine"
BPD,fcsnyna,t3_eipevy,1577920741.0,I don‚Äôt really like to say thank you either. Mostly because I usually don‚Äôt ask for anything from anyone and if they do something for me expecting and thank you it feel like it‚Äôs just fishing and not genuine??
asl,fcsn46r,t3_eio50y,1577920136.0,The above comment is good. But also in ASL you don‚Äôt have to really reiterate because most things are understood when you‚Äôre all ready taking about it. Just leave the pronoun out they know what you‚Äôre talking about.
BPD,fbz6wfh,t3_ef0vwb,1577236948.0,The worst.
BPD,fbyv7zu,t3_ef7d6j,1577227231.0,I do this too. I just try to remind myself of why this person is in my life and what they do to show me they love me. That always makes me feel more sure of my life choices.
BPD,fbyv5mc,t3_ef0vwb,1577227179.0,I know how you feel. My best friend killed herself two months ago. Feel free to message me and we can feel sorry for each other üòîüòî
abusiverelationships,f90h630,t1_f8zhbj5,1574972292.0,I often wish I could read those articles and not feel like I am the one who is the abuser.
abusiverelationships,f90fbm3,t3_e2w3ra,1574971567.0,"Fortunately, I‚Äôve had an IUD since I was 14. I had a false positive on a pregnancy test about a week ago and when I thought I was pregnant all I could do was cry. I want a baby but scared..thank you"
abusiverelationships,f90eoxd,t1_f8yx6rs,1574971327.0,"I have BPD as well. Good for you for your recovery. I wish I had the strength to walk away...I have no where to go. And if I did walk away it would crush me to pieces to the point that I‚Äôd have to be hospitalized probably, and that scares the shit out of me."
abusiverelationships,f90e15y,t1_f8yqvin,1574971059.0,He says things like I‚Äôm super mature and he doesn‚Äôt see me for my age..But he always talks horribly about his ex‚Äôs and it was always their fault and they were crazy in his eyes. He‚Äôs done that whole crazy thing to me to the point where I can‚Äôt even function because I feel like there‚Äôs something really wrong with me. I‚Äôm stuck.
abusiverelationships,f90dp1n,t1_f8yjnb0,1574970932.0,"In a way...but I‚Äôve had problems with people my age for the most part. Inexperienced and immature. The age difference didn‚Äôt seem like a big deal at first, but I am starting to realize it‚Äôs definitely a control thing. I just don‚Äôt want to see him as this kind of person."
abusiverelationships,f90d69d,t1_f8yet83,1574970728.0,This actually made me laugh! Haha :)
abusiverelationships,f8y1xmc,t1_f8ubpwo,1574939715.0,"You are not low, our past fucks with our ability to cope with things in a healthy way. Not saying it‚Äôs okay to hurt someone, but sometimes it‚Äôs a natural reaction to someone yelling in your face for hours and saying the most terrible things to you. I do it. Again, not saying it‚Äôs okay but I will not sit there and let him bully me. I‚Äôm gonna stand up for myself."
abusiverelationships,f8xyla8,t1_f8v1qh0,1574938037.0,I want to know how you can turn the victim of an abusive relationship into an exaggerated drama queen? Do you feel like a bad friend and you just needed to make yourself feel better? Or do you genuinely think it‚Äôs her fault?
abusiverelationships,f8xy707,t3_e1vhx7,1574937831.0,Classic guilt trip.
abusiverelationships,f8xy5vt,t3_e29qwv,1574937814.0,"Good for you. Going back to work won‚Äôt be easy, but you got this. <3"
abusiverelationships,f8xx7le,t1_f8xwju4,1574937310.0,"Thank you so much for your reply. <3 the thing is, my mom is no better and sees it all and just keeps to herself. When she isn‚Äôt making me feel like shit, he is. I just love him when we are happy though and I would miss him..I‚Äôm all ready living with him so it‚Äôs hard to think of how I could possibly get away without being homeless for a little while and putting my family out."
abusiverelationships,f8xwvk1,t1_f8xw17q,1574937126.0,Not really that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm asking...don‚Äôt have much support or any way out right now.
abusiverelationships,f8xwt2t,t1_f8xvpwq,1574937085.0,Unfortunately me and my mom have no positive relationship and she‚Äôs ungrateful as it is. I have it coming at me from both of them and she is depending on me financially. I can‚Äôt even go to work like this. That brings me even more shame...you have a really good point though. I don‚Äôt ever want my children to think something like this is normal.
abusiverelationships,f8xudfr,t3_e2qfdc,1574934901.0,"I see you have no replies so I‚Äôll just put in my two cents...I think that‚Äôs totally something I would want to do. But people often just mind their own business and don‚Äôt want to get involved in something like that. Usually people in an abusive relationship aren‚Äôt always receptive, or they don‚Äôt have positive reactions when you call it how you see it. Maybe another woman would understand if you asked her, but hard to say the same for men..I have always been shot down when I‚Äôve reached out like this. But you do what you gotta do honestly, just my two cents.."
abusiverelationships,f8xu306,t1_f8xtvst,1574934448.0,Thank you :)....except I don‚Äôt think anyone wants to be here lol

BPD,f8p2sur,t1_f6ufzaj,1574694712.0,"It‚Äôs hard to claim anything that is self diagnosed. We feel like we don‚Äôt have a right to identify with a disorder without being diagnosed. I self diagnosed myself as BPD way before a psych told me I actually had complex trauma disorder. They are the same thing, now I feel better because that means I‚Äôm not chemically imbalanced, I‚Äôm emotionally traumatized and there‚Äôs a difference. As long as you are being honest about where your diagnoses is coming from that‚Äôs all that matters. üíú"
BPD,f8oz8li,t1_f8nui1k,1574692941.0,Ostracized. Perfect.
