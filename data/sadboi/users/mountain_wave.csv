AmItheAsshole,fqftlbs,t3_gih4et,1589331436.0,YTA for sure. You can get another dog to be trained to be an emotional support dog or service dog. If my house burned down and my dog ran away on top of that I would be beside myself. I would never stop looking for him. And then to find out my dog was alive after being found across the country? You best believe I would get my boy back.

DoesAnybodyElse,fhw1q4e,t3_f4uijz,1581904613.0,"100% yes. I don’t talk about my emotions to my parents at all. Not just emotions, but if I’m in a stupid fight with my boyfriend or I’m just going through a bout of depression, I hide it all. They count on me in crisis situations. When my uncle passed away, who we were all very close with, I stepped up and arranged a lot of the funeral, because I was able to suppress my emotions and get through it. I took time for myself to break down in front of friends or alone. We had to put my childhood dog down two weeks ago, and I spoke with the vet and filled out the paperwork and made a lot of the decisions, even though I wanted to cry just as much as they were crying. But I had my time to break down. I hurt, but I don’t let them see. If they knew the kind of stuff I’ve gone through, it would kill them. I do it all to take care of and protect them."
MedicalAssistant,fhvv4bb,t3_f4xae3,1581901646.0,"EPIC is hard. The company I work at switched over to EPIC before I started working there and some of the MAs still have trouble with it. I find that I can do something one day and then the next day completely forget how to do it. 

The people at your office are awful. I could not imagine having to work in an environment like that, especially because I started at my office fresh out of MA school and had so many questions. I still ask questions. I can’t imagine being huffed and puffed at asking perfectly normal questions. You have a lot of compassion, I can tell by the way you’re hesitant to leave because your provider won’t have an MA. You need to focus on YOU. If you’re unhappy and uncomfortable in your workplace, you might not be able to be the best MA you are capable of being. You deserve to be happy and comfortable at your job. Don’t worry about your provider. It’s the office’s problem to figure out what to do, not yours. They will figure it out. Focus on yourself, that’s the most important."

AskReddit,ffjm32k,t3_ett7fr,1580001386.0,"When I was young, my mom used to go to the grocery store on Saturdays. She would drop me off at my grandfather's house every time she went to the store because it made life easier on her and my grandfather and I always did something fun (board games, ice cream sundaes, etc). One Saturday in particular I begged my mom to take me to the grocery store with her. I wanted a specific snack, one that my friend at school had that I just HAD to have, and wanted to go with my mom so we got the right thing. My grandfather felt bad to miss out on a Saturday with me, but he understood. I went to the store and got my snack. Meanwhile, my grandma had come home from work to discover my grandfather had passed away. He was slumped over on the couch with his rosary beads in his hand. He had a heart attack. To this day, I blame myself. I should have been there, I could have saved him. I could have called 911 and gotten him the helped he needed. It has made me into such a paranoid person. I miss him like crazy."
