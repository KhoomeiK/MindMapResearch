rescuecats,fodsp5p,t3_g6xzch,1587689407.0,"You’re doing a good job! I promise, it sounds like you’re doing everything right. 

I rescued a stray kitten after her brother had a stroke and died on my porch (rough origin story) and she straight up hated me. So I left her alone, I provided for her needs and I was pretty much always in her room with her, but I didn’t force anything. She adapted pretty fast but she was also a bit younger than your cat. It took her about a month to warm up to me, now she adores me, I literally have to pull her off of me if I want to get anything done.

That being said, her trauma still very much affects her. She is scared of pretty much everything and I’ve had her for almost two years now. She’s gotten A LOT better but if you didn’t know how she was in the beginning you’d think she was the most skittish cat alive. It takes a lot of patience because you’re fighting two issues here: her being feral at first and having a traumatic experience with the foster. 

I try to reduce any unnecessary stress, I know what really sets my cat off and I try to avoid it. But I also know when she wants to do something but she’s too scared (she does this little dance) so I’ll push her into something that is scary. So far, knowing when to push and when to protect her has been super effective. 

But tbh, your cat may just be scared for the time being and once she realizes she’s safe she will become outgoing. That happens too. regardless, you’re doing just fine.

And if you need more advice r/catadvice tends to be a bit more active!"

I think my cat prefers burrowing, we use to live in a house with plenty of high places and she always preferred being hidden under stuff. She’s always watching too. Now that we moved into a small apartment she’s become a master at burrowing. She’s small too, so there’s a few places she can get under that my other cat cannot. She sometimes let my boyfriend pet her, and she’ll hang out with my grandmother but other than that I’m the only one she lets near her. I’m watching for more red flags with my boyfriend... it’s tough because his family raised him to see animals, primarily dogs, as tools. All their dogs were trained to be aggressive to ward off any intruders. The family refuses to go to the vet, and if they need to put a dog down they just get a gun. It horrifies me but I’ve been talking to my boyfriend about it and even had him come to the vet with me to see what it’s like, lately he’s been against the whole gun thing and supports the vet. So he’s changing now that he sees another viewpoint... but it still concerns me. Also I like succulents but I don’t like owning them, I can’t seem to keep them alive.
