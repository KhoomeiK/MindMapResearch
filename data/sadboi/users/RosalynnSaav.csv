JonBenetRamsey,fr13rpa,t1_fr0ylmx,1589812688.0,Thank you! I'll check all of that out.
JonBenetRamsey,fr06igy,t1_fr04cyd,1589785239.0,"Okay, I believe you. Like I said, i am just getting into this rabbit whole. I've found it difficult to understand the facts of this case because there is just so much information. I have been diving into her case for about a week, and from what I could find this is an Idea I wanted to put out to people that new more than me. I didn't want to argue, just get perspective with my limited knowledge. If it doesn't line up, all I wanted were concrete reasons why to improve my knowledge and perception, that's all"
JonBenetRamsey,fqzgg31,t1_fqyfdg8,1589766846.0,"I'm not talking about the case, I'm saying that before she died throughout her life she was abused by multiple people and her parents allowed it"
JonBenetRamsey,fqycbxt,t1_fqx1eh3,1589746287.0,"I've been thinking about the idea that maybe she was repeatedly abused, and her parents allowed other people to abuse her as well. Maybe one of the abusers went to far and they covered it up because it would expose them for allowing daughter to be used by a substantial amount of people like that. What do yall think? I'm new to the case and would love opinions on it"
TrueCrime,fqv5f35,t1_fqv5bjg,1589670225.0,"Join it!! You'll love it, they post artwork and discuss symptom management together, it's a really wonderful community of people"
TrueCrime,fqv1wm6,t1_fqv1iyl,1589668226.0,"I will definitely read it! I've listened to a couple podcasts on him, his case is terrifying. I cannot imagine living life trapped in a mind like that. The schizophrenia reddit is amazing, I love hearing everyone's experience with the disease and how much they all support each other on the sub is incredible."
TrueCrime,fqv0tk5,t1_fqv0s9b,1589667612.0,Thank you for your detailed response. I appreciate it
TrueCrime,fqv0fao,t1_fqq5jgh,1589667391.0,"I think maybe I misinterpreted the discussion, I agree with everything you are saying. People with severe mental illness that commit violent crimes should not be charged normally, they deserve help and a chance to lead a normal life."
TrueCrime,fqpxttt,t1_fqpt1z7,1589555942.0,"I can, Ellyn Saks has sever schizophrenia and she is one of the smartest, most I influential people in mental health law. Look her up."
Cirrhosis,fn4yp09,t1_fn4xhi9,1586651892.0,"And what you said about everyone excepting you to be better: that was one of the worst parts for my dad. Just because you're low on the scale doesn't mean you're cured, you just have to live without access to treatment for the sake of people who are sicker. It's so twisted"
Cirrhosis,fn4yem8,t1_fn4xhi9,1586651707.0,"I hear you friend! That's exactly where my dad was. It took 2 years before my brother and I decided one of us would donate. It is a grueling fucking trip. He got his meld score down to like 7 or 8 too, and then it's just like ""okay, youre healthy enough to not need a transplant, but you still need one lol good luck."" Its fucked up. Hes got a pretty gnarly hernia now too, and they wont do shit because its ""cosmetic""? 
I always say people with liver disease are some of the strongest people on the plant. Yall are my heroes for everything you persist through, with none of the support or recognition that other illnesses get. Sending you love ðŸ’•"
Cirrhosis,fmnm7x9,t3_fvic3p,1586229367.0,"This exact thing happened to me when I was 18 as well. 
You need to get an adult involved, call a lawyer, evoke power of attorney, whatever you can do to get him out of the house. You cant take full responsibility of his health and care right now. 
I'm so sorry you have to go through this. 
The best choice I made was getting someone involved, it took all the pressure off and got my dad the help he needed. 
It will get better I promise, stay strong. Please DM me if you need to"
cripplingalcoholism,fja452a,t1_fj91uw2,1583165993.0,"There were signs that would have been clear to us had he told us about them, but unfortunately he was really good at hiding how sick he actually was. 
His eyes turned yellow one night and we brought him to the er, where is organs shut down one by one."
TrueCrime,fj54suc,t1_fj4xkut,1583024204.0,"Exactly, I think that is the core issue that we as a country are dealing with currently. We all have different ideas about how to fix it and unfortunately it has divided the US deeply"
TrueCrime,fj4wk6h,t1_fj4vv2u,1583018607.0,"Honestly, I don't have an answer. If I was a teacher and that poor kid came into my class looking like that, I'd never ever let him him leave. Ever. 
I think what it comes down to is American social welfare (and many other things) are so rooted in money and bureaucracy that kids like gabriel just fall through the cracks. Our nation is massive, we have a lot of generational trauma here, and because of an in inadequate system to protect and help our most vulnerable things like that are still allowed to happen. 
I hate to even try to rationalize it, there is no excuse"

cripplingalcoholism,fi7jrsy,t3_f6vrii,1582222714.0,"I've said it before on this sub, but my 23 year old brother died from liver failure.

My father has a terminal illness, I've sat by his death bed 2 to say goodbye, each time I've gotten another chance, but it has reminded me that in those moments I thought were the last I wished for more. Put as much asides as you can, you will be happy to be there with him at the end. 
Fuck your family, this is about you seeing someone you love and giving them the support they need for the last time. Nothing else matters. 
Be with him and appreciate him. No matter how bad he looks, show him how much he means to you and be there. 
You won't regret it

You should read elen saks ""the center will not hold"" she is a prominent mental health lawyer who has SC and went through something very similar to what you are going through. It's one of the most encouraging books I have read and helped me immensely. 
There is definitely a stigma around it, but dont be ashamed of who you are and educate people. 
Be proud of yourself and rock it"
