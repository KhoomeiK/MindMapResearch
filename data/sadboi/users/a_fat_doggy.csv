relationships,fojog1m,t1_fodgg4l,1587825922.0,Yeah a month isn‚Äôt a tonne of time... there‚Äôs plenty of couples not having seen eachother for over a month during quarantine. I personally have been feeling pretty neglected by my bf due to illness or things going on in his life for almost a year. The closest I‚Äôve come to cheating was having a conversation and hanging out with a friend I used to send nudes to for a week before my bf and I even met. It was fully platonic but that literally the closest just because of background. We have only been together for over a year not married. If she‚Äôs lonely she could find hobbies and friends. If it‚Äôs a relationship issue she could have communicated or sought therapy or guidance from others. She‚Äôs in a marriage ffs. A month is pretty quick to go from co worker to fuck buddy.

Yes, please please communicate, not just your final decision but your thoughts and processes too, he is also part of this relationship. Above all he has also chosen to stay till now, you haven‚Äôt forced him. It‚Äôs only fair. He may have things to say and new perspectives. Why do you feel like you aren‚Äôt giving him what he needs? Has he seemed discontent? Is it something you can work together on? Therapy is often better than heartbreak. If this is also a recurring issue with yourself in relationships I suggest you fix that before moving onto anyone else. Future trouble will be inevitable otherwise. It is also possible he is aware of these issues you have, and is just patiently waiting for you to come through so you can be happy together once it‚Äôs resolved, work on it. I am glad you are concerned about his happiness, don‚Äôt ruin it by throwing away something good you can work on. Good people are rare, I‚Äôd know. Heartbreak can only be fixed so many number of times, it would be terrible to hurt him only to want to possibly come back. The trust may then be gone. Definitely talk to him, extensively and truthfully. You may be afraid but it‚Äôll feel so much better having the weight off your shoulders being able to share that with him and him knowing what‚Äôs going on in the relationship he is also part of instead of it being taken from under his feet without a say. If the answer is to end it, end it. Don‚Äôt beat around the bush, that only causes more pain. And yes, quarantine is bringing out the worst and best in everyone..."
relationship_advice,fmobsrj,t1_fmo9cdo,1586253062.0,"I didn‚Äôt mean to hurt you, I‚Äôve always been a straightforward person and in my most honest opinion people get bored when the other person isn‚Äôt boring and is great because they themselves become boring, or in reality a serious long term relationship wasn‚Äôt what they really wanted and the fun bit is gone so now they are too. Immature is because a relationship and loving is always a choice. It‚Äôs true people can chose to leave for whatever reason they like but things will always happen in relationships and in life whatever they may be, it‚Äôs inevitable. The only thing that keeps people together is choice, not fun, ‚Äòlove‚Äô, attraction, money, whatever else, although those make it easier. If he is not boring and is sweet and all I am truthfully not quite sure what you mean by stagnant in the relationship, do you mean you don‚Äôt feel like you are growing? That is your own duty. That your relationship is not growing? Talk to him about it and decide where you want it to grow, he seems like he will hear you out and work together on it. You are after change? Did you just pick the wrong person? Then you should really reevealuate your decisions before someone invests what seems to be a good amount of time and emotional energy into you and the relationship, and end the relationship if this isn‚Äôt it. If you are afraid of hurting him just know that there‚Äôs no easy way to do it, you will hurt him either way but he will be ok if you are gentle yet firm, he will just have to seek support from others and be strong, it‚Äôs his own duty, but if you wait you only let him waste more time and energy on a relationship that really doesn‚Äôt exist anymore. What have you done to help the situation? A relationship is work. Figure out what you want, is it your personal issue? What personal issues do you have? Communicate that with him. Again and again. I do not understand really what the issue is though still, feel free to elaborate more, I do sound harsh very often but I am trying to get to the point and help, if what I‚Äôm saying isn‚Äôt something you want to hear anymore that‚Äôs fine too and good luck (not sarcastic)"

Second example: 
You are looking for a joint but nowhere sells it or you have no money etc. You spot a guy behind a store that‚Äôs smoking some, you chat them up and build a relationship so you can maybe share his bud. You may or may not really care for them but your focus is getting some bud.

He needs to grow the f*** up. It is beyond valid to feel this frustration and resentment, I was the kid that had to get things done due to my parents incompetency. Since seeing a therapist about how damn stressed I am I've been told to have firmer boundaries and take care of myself more, and as hard as this sounds, if they cannot get their own shit together it is not your responsibility to get it together for them. Your father is a grown adult, not in an aged care, not a child, not disabled. Go live your life hun, tell him to grow up grow a spine and get his shit together and be a goddamn father for once."

Dad was constantly on the verge of suicide and went to therapy for years but it didn‚Äôt help, 1 week of thyroid hormone made him a brand new man though."

I have been with my boyfriend for over a year and most of it he has been sick and he hated his body, but I have always made sure he felt attractive and loved. I am undoubtedly also stressed out. I have never disrespected him like this though."

UnsentLetters,fim4hkc,t1_filp1ew,1582517918.0,"I don't really see it as revenge, but ensuring she is fixing whatever issue she is having that's causing her to throw her own crap onto everyone else. Just the same as forgiving a murderer doesn't do anything except relieve your own pain, they have not learnt and will hurt others exactly like they hurt you, making sure they get help, whether that's rehab or whatever else I think is essential in actually solving the problem."

UnsentLetters,filedd6,t1_fildycg,1582499689.0,"It feels great to forgive, that's fine. It feels even better to know you're making sure this shit show doesn't happen again, to anyone else especially, because that person has learnt their lesson."
UnsentLetters,fil8hf9,t3_f88486,1582495949.0,"If it was up to me, I would find forgiveness useless here. She does not deserve what she has not earnt. She has done nothing at all to deserve it. She has no regrets and no repentance even, has not given you the same mercy of care you have given her and her children. Has done nothing to fix this for you and your mother. I presume I can say the same for your dad also. Though I understand the desire not to hurt her children and not to feel an anger inside yourself."
