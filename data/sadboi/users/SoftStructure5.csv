SuicideWatch,fqksuth,t3_gfsv5a,1589435322.0,"I know this post is old but I've come to the conclusion that therapists, psychologists, nurses,docs,ect come from one of two molds. One the nair do well social reform types who believe in the goodness and hope of all men or Two, the seen some shit and really truly understand it types. Some of the worst shrinks I've seen come from really good happy backgrounds. Things that ""broke"" them as kids or inspired them to get into therapy don't even blip on the radar of honest to god hardcore shite. Fundamentally they want to help the world with out knowing anything about it. This in my opinion, aside from his antiquated understanding of the sexes and lack of general knowledge about young children, is what makes Freude and Barlow such hacks. Both of them observed and determined on preconceived notions that for example,  Freude, witnessed common behaviors and explorations of a child (which we now know are boring normal signs of a child's development) and then attributed a fixation on those behaviors to a supposedly unchanged or ""stuck"" adult mind. Similarly Barlow's theory of attachment was based on his biased life experience. His disconnected parents and the subsequent pain he experienced when his nanny left at 4 years old predisposed him to assume that this disconnection from a caregiver he assumed causes all a child's ills. 

In reality he is a direct contradiction to his own model. Education, culture, economics, and values matter more to a child's development and success than any single caregiver. Lack of care equals lack of sucess. (This is also why I vehemently disagree with opinions that state all orphanages and homes are bad. I grew up in one after suffering through one poor carer after another, J.K Rowling's perception of orphanage care comes from the worst possible settings. An underfunded, understaffed,infrastructure poor corrupt country, as Romania was in the 1980s, with few domestic opportunities thanks to a struggling post soviet economy. The study she bases her views upon has several thousand statistical holes. For one, sampling a single impoverished nations orphanage population. Ehat the data shows is the negative effects of impoverished care. Fostering is a dirty word amoungst men and women's prisons for a reason. More often than not inmates were themselves a product of poor disrupted foster families. 

There are many reasons why placing a child back in an environment with poor biological caregivers is a horrible idea, no matter what the money does short term , it cannot stop endemic behaviors and lacking infrastructure which contribute th o the poor life outcomes for neglected and severely abused/disabled children. 

In any case, let usc redress Barlow. The man Barlow, lost a primary care taker but had recourse to ecomonic and educational opportunities and friends (effectively creating his own community i.e, support) which then allowed him to succeed in life. Economic means, culture and educational opportunities provided the means for him to have a stable life. His parents who by today's standards were rubbish, were not heavily involved in his upbringing and paid some one else to do it. 

Honestly if people wonder why most parents are so stressed or that alternately kids don't want to have kids, it is this. People do not want to acknowledge that by going foreward, allowing women an active place in society, we have also gone back. Instead of women operating charities,caring for their husbands careers,or their own happiness women choose a model where the poor and less educated take care of children in order to allow them to have a full career and avoid direct work  in their children's lives. It is a matter of time or money. Either parents do it all and go mad or do less and then fail to understand what truely creates successful kids.

This is not to say hands off parenting is bad, it simply matters more that patents choose the appropriate support persons,educational facilitates, extra curriculars, and counselors to succeed. Effectively the modern parent chooses either to be overly involved and stressed or less involved and fiscally held to choose the correct caregivers for their children. And people wonder why no one wants kids. 

It is entirely possible to raise children who go on to be successful with less money, but it also means spending where it counts. Skipping the video games,cell phones, and cartoon streaming for music lessons and free days at the museum. For example a poor parent thinks band means individual instruction when really it is an accoutrement to supplement lessons. Band is the gruop pay off for honing individual skills at home with a tutor. A band director cannot reasonably instruct 70 different pupils or more with 5-7 seperate sections, in the span of an hour each day.Taking kids on trips to the library and the park rather than putting them in every varsity sport team and practice available, making them manage their own time and finances long before their peers.

Sorry for getting off topic. I understand where you, the OP, are coming from. Some counselors don't have the balls to admit what they learned in school is a crock of shite in real life. Others, know it is wrong but those discerning counselors are an exception rather than the rule. Alternatively , some psyches who make poor counselors now wise up and really look at the effectiveness of their attitudes and treatment and see ig is wrong. Older and hypothetically wiser, they get it together and redress where they have been wrong in the past to give better solutions.

We are listening, drop a line if you need."
