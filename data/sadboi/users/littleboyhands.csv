AskReddit,fisvucb,t3_f9kd1v,1582694872.0,"TLDR; rolled my car on Thanksgiving, walked away from the crash with minimal injuries.

When I was 18, I had a panic attack while driving and  rolled my car. It was on a country road on Thanksgiving day (was on my way to my bfs house for dinner) and thank fuck, because there were hardly any other cars in sight on the holiday. I have no idea how I didn't hit another car head-on, or even a light post. I've had panic attacks before, but at this point,  never while driving. I pretty much just couldn't breathe, started losing my vision, and started jerking the wheel to regain control, which made me flip.

My car landed upside down, with the cabin conveniently sitting in the ditch. I learned after the fact that, if I'd landed a few inches forward, my head would've been crushed. Interestingly enough, however, I didn't even lose consciousness. When the car stopped rolling (only flipped twice I believe), I unbuckled my seatbelt, which caused me to fall down onto the ceiling. The first thing I did was feel up and down my legs to make sure that there were no bones sticking out (I had a close friend break both his femurs in a car accident the summer before senior year, and that wasn't too dissimilar an accident). Once I realized I was mostly unhurt, I also started to realize that I could hear my phone playing music, although I couldn't see it anywhere. For whatever reason, I knew that I had to try to grab it before I got out. I shimmied around and found it under a pile of dirt just outside of my shattered driver's side window. I grabbed that shit and climbed to what looked like the highest part of the car, which was the back end. Thankfully, the rear windshield (along with the every other window in the car) was completely smashed out, and it was positioned high enough on the dirt wall that I could just shimmy up and out of the car. I stumbled onto the side of the road and called my mom, then 911.  

I was insanely lucky that my phone was playing music, because there's no way I would've found it otherwise, and since nobody witnessed it, I was the first one to call 911 by an entire 5 minutes. Mind you, this entire accident happened in the space of (not even) 60 seconds. Some (understandably) concerned passersby pulled over to see what was going on, and a complete stranger let me wear his jacket and sit in the passenger seat of his car, despite being covered in mud and blood, while some doting old women spoke on my phone to the dispatcher until the cops and ambulance arrived.

I walked away from that accident with a concussion, some nasty cuts from the glass, but no stitches, although it did leave me with years of crippling PTSD. Hands down the scariest experience I've ever had, and the closest I think I've been to death. 

Now every Thanksgiving I get drunk with my family and closest friends, and I actually have a lot of fun working as a delivery driver. If anything, that accident has taught me the insane power of a car, how to know when too much is too much, and how to control it. I'm definitely a way better driver now. I joke with my friends that I might even be able to be a stunt driver someday.

My band and I went on tour across the east coast last spring, and we crossed like five of these. but by far, the worst one was the bridge from Connecticut to Delaware (?).

selfharm,fi9lair,t3_f6xlo7,1582270315.0,"The interesting thing about self injury is that it releases feel-good chemicals in your brain when youre seeking mental relief at first, making it harder and harder to stop. I've met a lot of people who started self injuring because of overwhelming emotions, but can't stop years later, even though they've kicked the overwhelming stuff. I've read that self injury is a bit notorious for being addictive. I struggle with a self-injury addiction myself, and I am usually not sad when I hurt myself. It's barely a coping mechanism anymore, I just get a rush. Best of luck to you ‚òÄÔ∏è"
