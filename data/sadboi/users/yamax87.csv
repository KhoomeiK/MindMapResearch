MicrosoftPowerApps,f6qkmia,t3_dsmhth,1573079377.0,"Think of a collection as a temporary store. 

Suppose you have a set of names in an imported Excel spreadsheet, and you set a gallery to filter out only the ones starting with 'H'. Harry, Henry etc. 

But what if you want to keep this new, filtered list for reference elsewhere? Eg, you want to add the filtered list to a set of 'favourites', or export them to a CSV? 

Here's where collections become useful. They're basically a form of an array (a generic method of storing data in programming). So you can store your selected list in a new collection. 

Eg:

Collect(Favourite_Names, Gallery1.AllItems)

You now have added the desired names to the collection. 

This saves you from having to read/write data from external sources and is commonly used to store data internally within PowerApps. 

Hope that helps!"

And secondly, even if this statement were correct, it does not in itself rule out our evolution from simpler beings. The picture I posted demonstrates very poor reasoning. It assumes that 1) all parts of a cell are co-dependent (this is not necessarily true, even at the cellular level) and 2) that this means that the cell could never have evolved from a previous, simpler state involving fewer components. This ignores the scientifically proven fact that the co-dependency emerged only after the cells became more complex. The DNA which is central to the cell's existence has not always been dependent on endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria and a nucleus."

Regarding majors, I just thought majors tended to be more liquid and less volatile than minors (with the exception of specific events eg Brexit).

Normally, as you say, NPCs are something of a distraction and their backstories are fairly shallow. Here, the idea was that a videogame addict at war would frame a pleading civilian as an NPC whose stories, emotions and general detailing were disturbing.
