But you're only allowed to pack when someone does tells you to, and only in the room they tell you to work in...but for 25 days, you're told you can't start packing yet because you don't have enough boxes. on day 27, the person never shows up to tell you what to do. The last two days, instead of giving you permission to pack and a room to work in, the person spends all day lecturing you that you've wasted your time and that the truck is coming soon and that you're not ready.

My mom is the type to nitpick you to death about things she sees as not up to her standards, and my grandma has dementia and everything you do for her has to be ~just so~ or else she'll refuse to cooperate. On top of that, because of the dementia she'll also change her mind about one thing 5 times in an hour, and then forget that she changed her mind and when you do the thing/bring her the thing the way she said she wanted it, ""I NEVER SAID I WANTED IT THAT WAY! WHAT, YOU THINK I'M STUPID OR SOMETHING?!"" And it feels like the fix for it is never one-step simple. No, every time I fuck up it adds about 15 new steps to whatever I was doing, and those new 15 steps are never something that can be put off til later, it's gotta be done RIGHT NOW. Which puts me behind in whatever I was doing for my grandma. Who doesn't understand *why* I'm behind, all she sees is she wants something, and she doesn't have it yet. So her dementia!logic says that I must just be being mean to her. So she cries. Then my mom gets annoyed that I'm taking so long to do such a simple task and gets up to do it herself while I'm fixing my latest mistake. And that's the cycle that plays out, 99 times a day, and by bedtime, I feel completely incompetent and ineffective and that I'm not any kind of help to her with grandma, I just make more work for my mom."
