But once you start having fun without needing a drink that is when life starts again.

You will struggle with this for a while.

You might think that it will never happen.

The feelings of negativety and feelings of not wanting to do something because you wont be able to have a drink.

But it does eventually happen.

Eventually you start to look at things a different way because now you have realized how to ive without the nasty drinks.

You will find new hobbies that will make you happy.
