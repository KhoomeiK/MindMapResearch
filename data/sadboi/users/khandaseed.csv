- stop listening to the idea that all successful people start young. Average startup CEO is actually in their 40s, many in 50s or 60s
- anything is possible 
- accepting that you will be older than most professional athletes on tv 
- finding fulfillment outside of work 
- giving yourself some time to figure it out. It‚Äôs a weird transition time. I have friends who started families, and I have friends who still party like they‚Äôre 22. Or smoke weed and play video games. Everything is cool

OutOfTheLoop,fi0cags,t1_fi076cc,1582033322.0,"Please point me to when I said Trump birtherism predated 2008. Yes, Hilary was dirty. Doesn‚Äôt mean that she‚Äôs responsible for everything bad under the sun. If you want to discredit Hilary, there‚Äôs plenty of other examples to use that some pseudo unproven news bullshit.

Blumenthal is an influential man. But the editor HIMSELF said he doesn‚Äôt have record. Also, in my earlier response, I said that it was completely plausible Blumenthal did ask around - after which I said why that isn‚Äôt the same as ‚Äústarting a movement‚Äù. So I take it beyond not reading articles, you also don‚Äôt read my response. Btw - why would you post an article if it‚Äôs such weak support of your point? I‚Äôm talking about what can be proven (ie what they said, and what it amounted to at the time) - not conjecture.

Also, I‚Äôm not a boomer but cool. Your lack of originality with YoU bOoMeR is pretty much in line with your thinking process here.

So in conclusion:
1) stated Hilary is behind the birther movement
2) as evidence posted an article, which explicitly quotes Asher as not having evidence. And draws the conclusion that nothing can be proven (which isn‚Äôt the same as it being wrong)
3) even on top of this - Asher himself said Blumenthal asked. And said nothing came of it. Whether he started the movement wasn‚Äôt even in contention. But you thought it was.
4) only responded to once part of my argument while ignoring other parts that don‚Äôt fit your view
5) claimed the article is bs because it‚Äôs a left publication, yet that‚Äôs what you posted to back up your claim
6) thought I was a boomer
7) claim I‚Äôm the problem

Why the fuck should anybody ever listen to anything you have to say. This is so incredibly stupid. I‚Äôm sure there are things you excel at that you should keep on doing. Presenting a valid argument isn‚Äôt one of those things. If you want to improve though, try separating speculation from fact. It doesn‚Äôt mean your wrong, but it doesn‚Äôt prove you right either.

The real problem is people like you. Whatever side of the spectrum you‚Äôre in, or whoever you support, the problem is people peddling unsubstantiated bullshit as fact and people following it. It‚Äôs what got Trump elected AND what got Hilary the dem nomination. It‚Äôs a problem with all sides.

Reconsider your approach.

Really what happened is that Blumenthal MAY have asked an editor to investigate something, which was shown to have no merit. Then when word got out, Trump claimed (and that‚Äôs the major word here), that this was the origin.

On top of all that, it can‚Äôt even be proven that Blumenthal asked. Having no record may sound like a cop out - but it‚Äôs no small thing - journalists are professionally expected to keep record of anything that gets published. 

But, even if it‚Äôs true (it is plausible Blumenthal asked) - Asking to investigate something is not the start of a movement. If I wondered if the earth is flat, investigated it, and found out it wasn‚Äôt - would you call me the originator of the flat earth movement? Of course not.

This is another example of exaggerated bullshit peddled by Trump, and people who are conditioned to listen to sound bites believing it.

I get the importance of stating facts correctly, and won‚Äôt deny we should ensure we define the problem correctly. But the amount of denial of an issue is baffling."
freefolk,fckow2h,t1_fckmjkw,1577730010.0,"If we want to get so nitpicky, I‚Äôm sure we can find many examples of this in any story we love. Further - if you want to only include plot points that are directly relevant to a character arc, you are doing a disservice. You take out a lot of the world building and context which make stories beautiful. Adding a scene which shows the humanity of Lannister soldiers builds the world, if not her character arc."
freefolk,fck9k5w,t1_fck6zf8,1577720231.0,"I‚Äôm actually going to disagree with this take. Ed Sheeran may have been distracting but it was a useful scene. Arya had this intense hatred in her heart for Lannisters. But along the road she ran into Lannister soldiers - who are just ordinary people doing their job. They have families and enjoy each other‚Äôs company. It was a good scene and a useful one if people can get past Ed Sheeran.

With all the shitty writing in season 8, there isn‚Äôt need to knock the good stuff."

freefolk,fc2o2qi,t3_efslku,1577368758.0,"These posts are so dumb. It‚Äôs contacts, not CGI. Emelia didn‚Äôt like the contacts. Nobody cared about this ever and we all loved the show. If you want to criticize, there are more than enough reasons from S7 & S8. These posts are just whiny as fuck and give cause for everyone to hate a fanbase"

Lower than trash. I know this may be insensitive but it‚Äôs the truth. What an insanely selfish douche. Get the fuck away from him and never let him close to you."

If people are out of line and hating on him / wishing ill on his family, that‚Äôs one issue. But booing? That‚Äôs part of the game"
nba,f8xhulw,t1_f8xen5e,1574919255.0,"It‚Äôs not that. It‚Äôs that in a job where you are in public eye, to deal with that pressure the least that can happen is that he gets compensated well. Which he does, literally more than 100x the normal person. It‚Äôs not perfect but sure close to equalizes. 

It‚Äôs part of the job at the end of the day, and maybe the job isn‚Äôt for him."

Athletes do have to put up with a lot. But they get compensated for it. It comes with the territory."
