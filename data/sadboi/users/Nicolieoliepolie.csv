I’m sure there are people on both sides listening so it presents an opportunity for you know people like Bernie Sanders to present his ideas himself to someone who wouldn’t otherwise give him a minute of their time and vice versa. It gives people who like having the opportunity to think for themselves do so.

I also like that he has the most random people on his show and these long, unique and solid interviews. Like Russell Brand, David Lee Roth and Tommy Chong.

On the other hand.. I can’t stand that he is a conspiracy theorist and gives a platform to other conspiracy theorists. I think it’s irresponsible to give them a platform in a time where truth has become subjective. It’s one thing to sit and consider possibilities and it’s known that the conversation is purely for fun but to talk about possibilities like they are proven alternatives to what evidence actually suggests... it’s dangerous. There’s too many people that will take something as truth just because someone they like and trust supports it rather than doing their own research. Or they do research and believe that whatever they find on the internet must be legitimate and get their sources from BS websites instead of scientific journals or other legitimate, non biased resources."

My boyfriend is a Steelers fan, I’m a Patriots fan.

He is more risk averse, I’m a risk taker. He likes control over almost everything, I’m more easy going.  

The list of differences between us is pretty long but we make it work because many of the differences aren’t deal breakers, we figure it out. And then there are the differences that are big but do not define us. We realize that we’re both so much more than our differences and there are things that we love about each other that outweigh the things that we don’t. 

It’s definitely harder work but not so much harder that we have to start considering whether it’s just pure incompatibility. Plus, it adds a sort of spice to the relationship.

- GPS - this way I’m not having to worry about my driving anxiety while also avoiding accidents while also trying to figure out how to get somewhere. I need it to be on a screen too, not just voice because I am terrible when it comes to miles. “3.3 miles make left” means nothing to me lol.

- Practicing the route if I can during low traffic times - I’m not sure if your test is on a known route... mine wasn’t but that was 16 years ago and I’ve heard many DMVs have known routes they use. Confidence in knowing where you’re going and what to expect helps a lot.

- Talking through your moves in your head while you drive can help. It makes me feel like I’m forcing my brain to be present in the decision I’m making. 

- Try to take the pressure off of yourself. Like if you’re that anxious about the test maybe it’s not time to take it. You don’t have to go off and get your license just because you turned a certain age. Driving is a big deal. Take more time getting comfortable with driving through parking lots or empty country roads. Then by the time you test for it, you’ll know that you know how to drive and if you get test anxiety... just try to talk it out with yourself.

Like whenever I’m doing something that gives me any level of anxiety, my brain fog is there. But when I’m done doing whatever it was that gave me anxiety or I’m doing it and it’s not that bad, the brain fog and anxiety begin to become less and less and then they’re gone.

AskWomen,fn2c999,t3_fyx1vk,1586584116.0,"Idk for me at least, I think if I were to instead say something nice to myself or agree with a compliment then it would make me appear conceited and most times if some girl is comfortable with herself, other girls don’t like it and will tear her down. That’s just what I see a lot and I think it kind of dictates how we take compliments and discourages us from talking positively about ourselves."
AskWomenOver30,fn25o9c,t3_fyvgkx,1586578537.0,"We’ve basically been quarantined for the last year; we moved to a state without friends or family, we live together, we both work at home so this is the same except we can’t go out like we would. Anyways, so this last year and during this quarantine I’ve noticed we definitely bicker and fight more but I think that’s expected when you spend 24/7 with anyone. You just have to recognize when it’s a real problem or something or when you’re just in need of some me time. I have noticed that although we fight a little more, there’s no one else I could imagine going through all this with. I think out of the two of us, I’m the one who requires more alone time and not having it has made me more likely to nit pick. I also have a part of me that thinks if it’s not perfect, it’s probably not right which isn’t true. So whenever I take time to reflect on these things or whenever I catch myself being particularly tough on him during this time, I end up looking at him and thinking how in love I am with him and our relationship. 

Also, it’s been super helpful having quarantine date nights. Take out, wine, good conversation, bubble bath... like throwing lighter fluid into the fire ☺️"
AskWomen,fn0njc2,t3_fybvg6,1586545224.0,"Most times I just need to mentally prepare. Sometimes I’m just not really in the mood to chat. Or if it’s bad news or depressing, maybe I’m in a good mood and those don’t come often so I don’t want to spoil it or I’m already depressed and don’t feel like adding to it. 

I very rarely get a text and immediately reply. If I don’t answer at all though, it’s because I forgot lol."
AskWomen,fmxjm9d,t3_fxvzgj,1586466219.0,"I don’t know if it saved my life but it’s possible.

I stopped at this gas station to get some things to snack on at work. I actually chose this gas station to avoid a cashier at the one I usually go to which is closer to work. This cashier always hit on me no matter how often I turned him down and it made me uncomfortable so I thought I’d save myself the awkward moment. Anyways! I was immediately approached by this guy who looked to be about 20 something asking me for money. I told him I didn’t have any cash and thought that would be it. Nope. He then asked me what I was doing today and I said I was heading to work. I went on towards the store and walked around looking for things and the whole time this guy just followed me closely like we were there together. I got so nervous that I mindlessly grabbed a few quick things and came to the cashier. I died when I saw the cashier because it was actually the guy I was trying to avoid, he was covering this location. What luck. He doesn’t say anything to me this time and I think it was because of the guy who was with me but I looked at him the whole time with this look and body language that I thought would indicate that I’m possibly in a bad situation but he didn’t get the signs. So I walk out with this guy still following me, wondering what the hell Im going to do. I get to my car and my gut told me just to hit my unlock once to only unlock my door and this guy actually goes around to my passenger side and pulls at the door to get in with me. I closed my door and locked the car and this guy mouths at me “what the hell?” And I looked at him like “no! Are you kidding me?!” And drove off as fast as I could. I never went to either gas station again."
oregon,fmt8x3r,t1_fmt71lg,1586368749.0,"Oh man. Yeah, I guess now that I think about it, the signs were basically on the curb from the parking lot which was close to the building. I’ve just never experienced people hanging around to push their candidate on me thankfully. That’s crazy to me."
news,fmt8ghx,t1_fmt3zur,1586368538.0,"I think that’s because all we hear and see on the internet are the people who want these things but there’s a whole world out there that either doesn’t want those things or those things aren’t at the top of their list of things they want a candidate to support. Plus, a lot of the people online saying they want certain things are the same people who either don’t or can’t show up to vote."
oregon,fmsyeje,t1_fmsvgjq,1586363946.0,That’s crazy. I come from AZ and I’m pretty sure they have a law that says people cannot do that within a certain distance of the booths thankfully.
oregon,fmsy4wa,t3_fx7m8t,1586363825.0,"I come from AZ and kind of freaked out when I registered to vote here and never got a voter ID card in the mail and then I learned that you guys are 100% by mail which is very nice.

Honestly, voter suppression aside. I think for AZ at least, they’re just slow to get with it. We have the choice to vote in person or we can do it via mail so I think having the option available has made it less of a priority to make it the only way to do it."
AskWomen,fmswnz6,t3_fwrn51,1586363162.0,"Recently. But mostly just the political subreddits. I started following r/politics because it was the only place I knew of that had the live discussion of the impeachment. After the impeachment, I kept following but after awhile... post after post of what the president and the republicans are and are not doing... I found myself more often enraged. And even the articles from hard left leaning sources and some not so reputable, I could for the most part take with a grain of salt but eventually it got harder to take those with a grain of salt and they would enrage me about as much as an actual good and not so biased source. It made my ability to separate my life from politics harder and it makes it harder to be happy so I had to leave lol."
AskWomen,fmsuone,t3_fx6yql,1586362287.0,I agree with these responses but I’ll add that the heel should be a good fit. I’m somewhere between 5.5 and 6 but I also have wide feet so sometimes I have to lean towards the bigger size which can make walking and running hard. Sometimes the shoe mostly fits but you can tell it’s just little big and then other times the shoe fits but the heel area is too slim so my heel will pop out often. Every once in a while I will find my perfect fit and I can walk miles and run like I’m wearing tennis shoes and it’s great.

politics,fmakcu0,t1_fm8z2m1,1585897137.0,Well god forbid they step on the toes of their bible loving constituents. So many of these politicians are more concerned about losing support for being “tough” on this than they are with the actual well being of people.

BrainFog,fk46qbr,t3_fg8lm3,1583854445.0,"I would say cutting down on caffeine has been a real success for me. Also, this post sheds a possible light on a mystery of mine. I cut back on caffeine entirely a few months ago but I caved and got a cup at an airport but I didn’t feel foggy. I’ve noticed that as long as I only have black tea or coffee once in a great while, I’m okay. Also, it seemed to only be okay if I got it at a cafe or something. When I drank coffee from my keurig... I got SUCH bad fog and thought all of my observations were thrown out the window until now. This makes a lot of sense! Now I just worry about the amount of bacteria I have in my body lol."
AskWomen,fjkwlso,t3_fdy4dj,1583435346.0,"Mixed. In the beginning, I thought she was going to be my candidate... she had her quirks and her faux pas but I liked her toughness when it came to corruption. I’m a Wells Fargo employee as well who worked in a branch when John Stumpf’s pressure cooker sales culture was there so when she tore him up over the scandal... I was sold on her. But over time, she made some mistakes on her campaign that caused her to lose her shine for me and I just wanted her to drop out. She pandered too much and latched on to isolating ideas. Which I would have been able to look past any other election but with another four years of Trump at stake... I’m looking at which candidate can beat trump more than I’m looking at who best fits my needs as a citizen. I think she’s more realistic than Sanders and she’s not Biden so I am sad to see her go but between her and Sanders... I’m going with him."

Like my boyfriend and I were talking about something and I felt the need to bring up this girl totally unrelated to the topic and I said something mean about her.

politics,fjhoxwq,t1_fjhjv8u,1583352347.0,"There’s a lot of people including myself that agree that there are far better options than Biden and of course Trump. Trump is a crook. I’m in the Bernie camp myself although I have some skepticism. However, the reality is that not rallying behind someone who actually has a chance will hurt us. I get not being able to consciously back someone and I’m not shaming you but I also don’t want to hear complaints when Trump is re-elected. I see it as putting what’s best for the country over what helps me sleep better at night. I can’t sleep knowing I voted for some third party that makes me feel better morally while Trump is running the country into the ground but I can sleep knowing I tried to take a vote away from trump by standing behind Biden if he’s the chosen guy. I’ll vote for Bernie in the primaries and I hope he wins but if not, my goal is to just get Trump out of there."
politics,fjhicyr,t1_fjhdkr4,1583348692.0,"Exactly. It’s amazing how many people refuse to believe that there are people who don’t prefer Bernie.

politics,fjhgmnl,t1_fjhduuq,1583347736.0,"That’s the mentality that will keep Trump in office. The DNC gave us a bad candidate so we showed them by not showing up for the candidate? We burned ourselves. I hate having to fall into the “voting for the lesser evil” but until the system changes, I’m just saying that we need to rally behind a candidate even if we don’t love them. The popular vote isn’t what gets people in office it would seem. Biden makes me cringe and I really hope he grows a thicker skin when he gets on that stage with Trump but whatever he does or doesn’t do in office will be an immense improvement from what’s currently going on in that office."
politics,fjhfhdv,t1_fjhd4oa,1583347103.0,"I do blame the DNC but I also blame the people who voted for a third party candidate who didn’t have a chance at all when they could have swallowed their pride and voted Hillary. I can’t stand her but I hate Trump more. There’s a bad system in place but until that changes, we have to work it as best we can which is rallying behind the person who gets the nomination."
