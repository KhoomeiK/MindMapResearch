You're young. It's perfectly okay not to know what you want to do for the rest of your life. Heck, I thought I did many times which is why I studied random stuff that went nowhere.

What helped me much later and perhaps it will you, is to look into different studies you're interested in and their job opportunities. You can even be a General Studies major or you start as a non-major too. You don't need to pick a major right away. More props to you for taking time rather people like me who majored in something impulsively without considering the job market.

I decided on a degree in Industrial Psychology. I worked for awful companies which made me want to learn how to improve work culture, employee morale, etc. IP isn't terribly exciting but it is interesting and valuable since companies shifting to more employee-centric cultures.

Basically, don't beat yourself over it. Enroll as a non-major or General Studies (which isn't worthless; my friend was a GS major and he makes six figures).

**One of the first ways to practice mindfulness of current thought is to catch a thought going through your mind and simply label it as a thought. You might say to yourself, “This is a thought, not a fact.” Another way to practice is to label the type of thinking you’re doing. When you catch yourself worrying, you might label your thoughts, “worry thoughts.” Try to separate fact from fiction by labeling the thoughts that go through your mind, such as worry thoughts, rumination, assumptions, judgments, inferences, guesses, self-denigrating thoughts, etc.**   \- [Source](https://dbtvancouver.com/managing-thoughts-mindfully/)

Look into disability accommodations at your school. I was given extended deadlines and frequent breaks. Talk to your professors! I told several of mine that I had BPD but I don't think it was necessary. My professors were some of my greatest cheerleaders. They want their students to succeed, especially those who have a few challenges. My professors and classmates were very supportive. I wasn't very social but my classmates were amazing. I cried once because I thought I failed my presentation but after class they were all encouraging and positive. It was really nice.

&#x200B;

Good luck to you and please, please PM if you want to talk about anything!"

&#x200B;

I was planning to purchase a memory foam mattress online but I stopped by a national chain mattress store and got a coiled pillowtop mattress instead at a low price. It's much more comfortable than the pre-existing memory foam bed that I had ordered online years ago. 

&#x200B;

I prefer to try my mattresses out in-person rather than blind buying even with the free trial. It's just a huge hassle to return it if it doesn't work out."

My apartment has very few outlets. It was cumbersome moving around a regular vacuum cleaner. I got a refurbished Dyson on sale and it made vacuuming much more efficient. 10 minutes at the most."
BPD,esqt43p,t3_c8uvl7,1562209273.0,"Actually, I never thought about being saved by someone. I was living in my personal hell. It was deeper than anyone can reach me. There were those, like former significant others, who brought me close to happiness but it was temporary.  It was a fight that I had to battle alone. It took years but I overcame BPD."

Sunscreen is always on my sink. I apply it after I wash my face in the AM and allow it dry while I brush my teeth. I mean, I always have to wash the grease off my face and I need to brush my teeth. It takes me 5 seconds to squeeze the sunscreen out of the tube and rub it all over my face.

I'm 35 years old and I have no wrinkles!

When I know I'll be out and about outside, I will apply sunblock. I'm indoors most of the time (isn't everyone?), especially in the summer."

If you have no experience, consider temp work. Yes, it's not ideal but any experience is good experience. Reach out to employment agencies. They should help you find entry-level jobs."

ApplyingToCollege,es447g3,t3_c5nzvi,1561576744.0,"This probably isn't much consolation but ...

I started college in 2002. I didn't study for the SATs and got 1000. I had a 3.0 GPA in HS. I went to a small, unknown university in Philadelphia that is now closed. I transferred schools many times and got an A.S. in Photography before ending at Northwestern University for my bachelor's. I just graduated with a 3.7/4.0 GPA. Let's just hope that my degree takes me somewhere. :\\

I didn't consider T50 but life is unpredictable."

&#x200B;

It was very hard for me to stay in school but I knew that my future and happiness depended on it. I had disability services to provide accommodations, which helped a lot. I didn't overexert myself in school. It wasn't the end of the world if I didn't get an A on a paper. I just needed to pass. Don't overwhelm yourself. Do one assignment at a time. If you can't focus, go to the library or a coffee shop or check out study halls on Discord. They really helped me."

3. Not really. Wear layers and you will be fine. Get the warmest coat you can (don't be cheap).
4. Be more specific about home. What makes your home/NU unique from other homes?"

Law school is HARD! You're going through a lot right now and I admire your resilience. 

I didn't work as hard as my classmates and that's okay. I didn't have the same mental or emotional capacity. 

So long as you do your work! Seek treatment. Take it easy on yourself."

happy,ertxra1,t1_ertx98q,1561256529.0,"School is much, much harder for us so naturally it will take longer to finish. You will be very proud of yourself soon. When you want to give up, give yourself a break. Remember that you're already in the process of success. Every day brings you closer to the end. Every assignment. Every class attended. Seek out disability accomodations too. Talk to your professors. Mine were some of my greatest cheerleaders.

I look forward to hearing from you in January!"
