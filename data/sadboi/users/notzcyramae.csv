selfharm,fomi3sa,t3_g814mo,1587890856.0,I do that too.
selfharm,fmoah99,t3_fw8tek,1586251622.0,I want my scars to be permanent too. But they all fade.
selfharm,fkmx5gx,t3_fjezqk,1584343600.0,Yes for me. I cut deeper when I feel psychological/mental pain the most. I even use a scalpel blade since I have access to it.
selfharm,f9lhv1v,t3_e5pezf,1575423471.0,"From what I know, keloidal scars depends on the genetics of the person.

Based on what I learned from my Surgery class:
- If you cut a tissue with a sharp instrument, it will heal better.
- If you cut a tissue with a blunt instrument and the tissue cuts are jagged, it will heal but it may cause worse scarring. Healing might take some time.

In my case, I use a scalpel blade so even if I cut deep and blood drips... the wounds heal better and it doesn't scar (and if it does, it just looks like a dark line on my wrist.) Most of my scars fade."
