AsianMasculinity,fphibbm,t3_gdi17e,1588621781.0,"I can fill you in, as I have experienced both sides quite vividly. 

In short, the answer to your question is ‚Äúboth‚Äù. 

I think there is a strong opinion that asian dudes definitely have it harder. I‚Äôve talked to girls who flat out said they don‚Äôt like Asian guys. The climb is definitely up hill.

My youth was filled with a lot of this hatred, and negative self talk. I hated asian women, because I hated myself. And that just plain sucks.

However, I would also challenge you with this: what are you (or the collective we) going to about it? We could just sit around, and complain about how bad it is. Yeah, it‚Äôs bad. 

But me personally, I got tired of this talk. I got tired of people telling me what I could and couldn‚Äôt be. I got tired of people telling me I wasn‚Äôt attractive. So I did something. I did pull myself up. Went to the gym. Worked more on presentation. Dressed better. Started really going after my passions, and expressed my opinions. 

Things really did get better. I felt 100% more confident, and happy. It‚Äôs always going to be a struggle, but at least I can see at the end of the tunnel. 

It‚Äôs always going to be an uphill climb, brother. But what options do we have? Lie down, and basically roll over. Or, do something, anything about it?

What I realized through this whole process is how much we as Asian men can change the landscape, one guy at a time. It does take though getting over the self-pity (albeit everyone should experience it), and owning your narrative. Our stories are more powerful, deeper than just a basic white bro. We have experiences to share that they could never. Use that. That‚Äôs what girls want. Thats what people want these days. People are far more open to new ideas and new people than ever before. 

Make em wish they were you."

But truth is, there‚Äôs a lot of moving variables. What most people discount is the possibility for something new, good or bad, that throws this whole situation in a whole other direction. 

Perhaps I‚Äôm a bit more optimistic than most people are. I accept that. But I also think the most realistic scenario lies somewhere in between. 

If anything‚Äôs for certain, yes, things will be different. But how it‚Äôs different is a developing matter."

Its kinda like a program you download, and then you download a ‚Äúdisk‚Äù (a virtual disk), and load it on. It‚Äôs kinda complicated, but that‚Äôs how I did it.

Edit: so it has nothing to do with browsers. It has everything to do with operating systems, which are like the difference between MacOSX (notice the different design, and layout) and windows 10.

The point is, it‚Äôs not about hot girls. It‚Äôs about women in general. Like anyone else on this thread has mentioned, it‚Äôs about not putting girls on a pedestal.

I think of it all as just being really aware. Conscientious. That‚Äôs not a bad thing. Being anxious is just a product of being really really aware. 

In terms of actual tips, what helped for me is therapy. Or at least verbalizing your anxiety. You‚Äôre not alone in this, even though it feels like it. And therapy helps validate that thought. 

Writing in a journal has helped me immensely. Working out helps, or even just spending time in nature, or walking, is highly therapeutic. 

I think it just comes down to accepting it. Realizing that these thoughts are there. And suppressing them just makes it worse. This is easier said than done. But again, nothing worthwhile is easy. 

In the end, you just find your ways to come to peace. That‚Äôs the scary part. But that‚Äôs the most powerful and transformational part.

LifeAfterSchool,fheqpk7,t3_f2krtu,1581527951.0,"Well, here‚Äôs my story.

I graduated university in 2018, in a degree that‚Äôs fairly technical (information systems). At the time, I was 20 years old. 

For some reason, I just expected myself to roll right into a job. That it‚Äôd easy. Not much work involved. Fast forward 6 months, no job offers. 

Had to work a part time job, which I did enjoy. But, overall, I was lost. I didn‚Äôt know what I wanted to do with my life. 

I had my life planned out since the time I was 12. I thought I was going to ace high school, go to a superb college, and be on the top while I work. 

Instead, I spent two years trying to figure out what I wanted to do, and was horrified of the future in front of me. 

My family moved to another state. For the first time, I felt really alone. My brother left for college. As did my sister. 

Yeah I traveled, Germany, Austria, Italy, SF, Chicago, LA in those two years. 

But man, those two years were rough. 

So all this is to say is don‚Äôt worry about it. Life has a way of sorting itself out. It‚Äôs fucking tough at times, but you‚Äôll figure it out. Trust yourself to make the right decision, and don‚Äôt let the pressure of other people telling you what you should do, cloud your personal judgement.

But for the second point, I disagree. I think it‚Äôs important to focus on yourself, but I do believe there are plenty of opportunities in girls that could help me, and support me in my journey. So, as long as I take a healthy look at relationships, I know I‚Äôll be better off."

Yes, I also and a post that was similar to yours. However, reading what you went though definitely made my heart hurt. Even though I suffered from rejection, and attachment issues, they are pale in comparison to yours. 

What I can say is, the first step is usually letting it out, and recognizing you feel this way, and are willing to work to combat these issues. So props to you for asking, and letting other people know!

I‚Äôd say when (or if you are now) in a relationship, I‚Äôd express your feelings of just going slow, and just a brief conversation about your fears, and worries. If they are good people, they‚Äôll understand. 

Finally, either via a therapist (which I recommend over other options, at least initially), or through friends, I‚Äôd talk to them about it. If you can, see if you can find other adoptees, or other people that have the same feelings you do. I did that, and it seriously helped me through some tough times.
