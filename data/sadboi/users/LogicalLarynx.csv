This will give me an opportunity to observe the game without having to trip up experienced players with my lack of knowledge! We can even prepare voice clips together so I can jump to each NPC with a little audio cue specific to that character.

DebateReligion,fhgom9v,t1_fhgmb1a,1581573294.0,"What you're describing is not choice, but the illusion of choice. A creator of an open-world game gives you options that you can choose from. They, however, cannot claim to know for absolute certain which of those options you will take, unlike an omnimax god.

What you neglected to mention, whether on purpose or by accident, is that this omnimax god, knowing all of these things, will still know **exactly which choices you will make, regardless of what other possibilities there may be.**

For free will to exist, your choices in reference to, ""...all possible arrangements of all possible particles, as well as all possible interactions and movements of those particles, as well as all possible living things, as well as all possible actions made by all of those living things, and so on and so forth,"" need to come as a surprise to an omniscient god, which is not possible, or the god is not omniscient.

If an omnimax god knows, ""...all possible arrangements of all possible particles, as well as all possible interactions and movements of those particles, as well as all possible living things, as well as all possible actions made by all of those living things, and so on and so forth,"" including the one choice you will definitely make, then you never made a choice. You just acted in accordance to what has already been determined.

As fun as it is to know what might happen, an omniscient god must also know what will happen. Abraham Lincoln's time is determined. We know what happened in his life. 

Even if we could know every minute detail, down to every single second, we would still not be able to influence it. Lincoln's life and ultimate fate is determined because we can see its start and end. As dumb as it sounds to say out loud, everything he did is in accordance with everything we know he did.

If we know all, we know everyone's entire story, written out perfectly, with every possible choice they could have taken, as well as every choice they ended up making. Just like we know Lincoln's life, we, being omniscient gods, know all of fate. 

No choice a person makes could ever surprise us, because we have always known what they were going to do, even if they didn't. Otherwise, we could not call ourselves omniscient.

To know the ultimate fate of all your creations, as one would have to know were they to claim omniscience and regardless of where in/on/around the flow of time they stand, is to know that their wills were never entirely their own - that their choices were made long before they were ever brought into existence.

Edit for...even more words:
If an omnimax God created a universe AND knows all, that God knows all that will happen in the universe it created. Not just what can be, but what absolutely will be. That God would then be wholly responsible for the fate of its creation down to the smallest detail. 

If this god's creation does something that is outside of their control or influence, they are not maximally omnipotent."
DebateReligion,fhgl139,t1_fhgk56b,1581570106.0,"Everything else I said directly addresses this, so I'll just leave this here for you to comment underneath."
DebateReligion,fhgiuxw,t1_fhgclz2,1581568328.0,">The omnimax god is typically defined to exist outside of time. Similar to how we exist outside of the time of Abraham Lincoln. We know what Abraham Lincoln did. That does not violate free will. You cannot apply a linear notion of time to a being that doesn't experience time.

>You're assuming what you're trying to prove, here. Essentially, this argument reduces to ""the universe is entirely deterministic, and therefore free will doesn't exist."" But your premise (the universe is entirely deterministic) is just a reformulation of the conclusion (free will doesn't exist). You'll have to prove that the universe is, in fact, entirely deterministic.

It boils down to how we define free will, then. My working definition is that to have free will is to determine one's own fate through their own actions, sans an external force dictating their every move. To determine one's own fate through their own actions is to be able to influence and alter one's future through actions taken in the present.

To varying degrees, none of us have full control over our fate, as outside forces will always play some role in one's future, but that's an arbitrary distinction for this argument. To whatever degree one can exercise free will, the argument is that they can...so long as the future isn't rigid and inflexible.

Regardless of whether or not an omnimax god exists outside of time, he is responsible for its creation, our perception of it, and our interaction with it. For a god to be omniscient, he must know all. If a god knows all, then that god must know everything with absolute certainty.

If he is omniscient, an omnimax god must know everything that has, is, and will happen to an absolute degree of certainty. If that's the case, then time must be something that can be known absolutely. 

If all of time is absolute, then the universe is by definition deterministic, and free will, at least as I defined it, could never be a factor.

**Again, whether an omnimax god exists outside of time is irrelevant if he is responsible for its creation and its influence over us, which is what we're discussing.**

**For the second part, that was my bad for poor phrasing. Sorry about that!**

It would make more sense of me to say that if a *maximally omnipotent* god were to create a universe where free will is possible, there can be no absolute, knowable future. 

The inverse being: If the future is absolute, there can be no free will. How could one possibly exert influence over that which is absolute?

If the future isn't absolute, then it isn't completely knowable, and omniscience is not on the table. Again, for true omniscience, a being must know all, including all of time, to an absolute degree of certainty.

If this sounds ridiculous and almost circular, that is the point I'm trying to make. 

**TL;DR-ish:** All of time is something that could be known. Therefore an omnimax god, regardless of whether they exist within or outside of time, must know all of time to an absolute degree of certainty. Free will, as I defined it at the top of this comment (and you're welcome to push back on that definition), cannot exist in a world where an omnimax God exists because that which is absolute to an omnimax god is unalterable to anything less.

**If you can, for my sake, please restate, ""Free will can exist with an omnimax God because-""**"
DebateReligion,fhg6r08,t1_fhfybtf,1581559872.0,"How can a being like God and free will exist at the same time?

If a being can have full knowledge of the future, then everything that happens is already predestined by default. If God is omniscient, we don't have free will.

If that same being also made everything and set time in motion, that being robbed the universe of its ability to exercise free will the moment it came into being.

If God values free will, the future needs to be practically unknowable, even to him. Then we're stuck in the whole, ""Could God make a rock so heavy that he couldn't lift it,"" loop, insofar as, ""Can an all-knowing God create a future he can't predict?""

If he can, then he's not truly omniscient. If he can't, then he's not truly omnipotent. But he must be both of these things (and omnipresent, but that wasn't really relevant) to be the God that 99.9999999-% of humanity believes in. 

If you're willing to say that your unique take on God made the universe, but isn't omniscient, great! Now you get to start your own slightly-altered sect of Christianity with a different, less powerful version of God.

I'm genuinely not trying to start a fight, here, but this always gets to me. I used to be Catholic, and this is what started me on the path to non-believing. Please help me makes sense of this!

Also, I love the idea of a ""Philosopher King"" in theory, but I believe it highly unlikely that any such being could ever exist. It truly is an ideal that we should strive for, regardless...something about aiming for the moon and still ending up among the stars lol"

I'll start by telling you that this is the beginning of a long and strong year for Crawlr. We've set our quarterly goals for the year, and will be actively updating the site and its community along the way!

It's important to know where we've been so you can appreciate where we're going. When Crawlr initially dropped, it was only a school project made by our fearless leader, Jackie; when she shared it on reddit, she was hoping to get roughly 20 more people to round out her user base. Instead, it BLEW UP! 

Over the next few months, thousands of people came by to check out her pet project. Jackie built a team, and together they did everything in their power to keep Crawlr going. As it turned out, with graduation looming, a wedding around the corner, and a host of other personal problems scattered throughout the team, Crawlr's sudden rise came at the worst possible time.

Now that we're back, it's fair to say our work from here on out will be tough, but everyone here believes 100 percent in Jackie and Crawlr. 2020 will be the year we work to strengthen our online presence, win back the trust of our users with consistent updates & communication, and create a Crawlr that everyone can get behind.

We will be putting out a more thorough update on the state of Crawlr soon, but I want you to know that we're all here for the long haul.

That being said, what in the actual fuck can I do about this? Are there any action steps? What can I, as some fat dude from New Jersey, do to effect positive change - to do my part keep stuff like this from happening?

I'm watching schools get shot up, kids get torn away from their parents at the border, and now China has been going in on their Nth mass-killing. Flint STILL doesn't have clean water, we've barely moved the needle on Climate change, and our education system is falling apart. 

I'm watching corrupt politicians and business(wo)men get away with everything short of murder, though I'm sure that's in there somewhere, while everyone significantly more powerful than me, the people meant to hold those other powerful people accountable, either turns a blind eye, informs us about it, or tries in vain to make it right.

I can't say that I'm annoyed anymore, or even frustrated, but genuinely and deeply exasperated by all of this. I want so much for someone to point me in a direction - to tell me where I can take a stand. To show me some sort of plan to right the wrongs of the world. To, at the very least, point out who to yell at or where to fight. 

At the end, I'm just getting into occasional Facebook arguments like an asshole, switching between the news and documentaries, trying to ""stay woke"" long enough to remember who I should or shouldn't vote for so that they can maybe, possibly, some day do what I consider to be right.

Even now, I'm just sitting in my office, staring at my phone, typing out a long-winded novella that will ultimately amount to nothing of consequence as the world burns around me. What can I do? Please, I need direction. 

On a lighter note, I did lose some weight recently...so it isn't ALL bad. Just, like, %99.999999 awful. Oh, that new Breaking Bad movie looks fantastic, and I heard that it's a satisfying ending for Jesse. So, %99.999998."
