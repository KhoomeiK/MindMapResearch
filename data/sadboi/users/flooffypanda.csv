Having a life where you don't constantly have to worry about going bankrupt if you get sick, or having to go to therapy every week to deal with all that emotional trauma from childhood, or just being able to buy a house... Those things don't equate to people being lazy and entitled. 

We're not asking for the world to be handed to us on a silver platter. We're asking to have a world worth living in. One we can breathe in. One where we can work, save money, buy a house and a car, all without having to save for our entire lives first. We just want a fighting chance. 
We want to wake up in the morning and not feel like it's hell just to be alive. 

My parents didn't give me a wonderful life. I've struggled and fought and spiralled into deep depression for everything I have. But my mom thinks my life is too easy. My mom thinks that her life is so much harder than mine. She owns a house. She's a stay at home mom to an 18 year old that just wants to move the fuck out. Her husband pays for everything and all she has to do is lay around the house and be bored. She has 10k in student loans. 
I work full time and was a full time student until recently. I have 68k in student loans. I have 6k in vet and medical bills. I rent a shitty 700sq ft apartment for twice what it's worth because that's all there is that I can afford. I will likely never own a house. I will be paying loans for the rest of my life. I go to therapy every week because of the physical, mental, emotional, and sexual abuse I suffered at her and her numerous boyfriends' hands. 
But my life is easier and I'm an entitled, spoiled little shit.

 - Smack them for being sad and missing their dad. 

 - Smack them for being talkative, or saying ""shut up!"" Or ""go away!""when they try to tell me about their day or ask about mine.

 - Drag them out of the house by their hair, while screaming. 

 - Pin their arm up behind their back so hard it starts to dislocate. 

 - Put my string of shitty abusive boyfriends before my kids/stand by and watch my string of shitty abusive boyfriends abuse my kids.

 - ask my 17 year old daughter to fuck my shitty abusive boyfriend so we can take the child and raise it as our own because ""he wants a baby of his own and doesn't think my body can handle it. And artificial insemination is really expensive, you could just sleep with him and it would still be my bloodline."" 

 - And finally, I never, ever, EVER want to gaslight my kids. I want to be able to accept that even if I don't remember it happening, they do and there's a compromise there. Me not remembering an event doesn't mean they're instantly wrong and need to be shut down and called liars... 

 My dad wasn't super in the picture, and the things he ""did"" pale in comparison to my mother.

 - be emotionally distant/void of emotion.

 - be unsupportive/invalidating.

tumblr,fp59mks,t1_fp4yzee,1588321178.0,"Pumas aren't a part of the panthera genus, though? 
Snow leopards, and the others you mentioned are, but cougars/pumas/mountain lions are in their own genus - puma - where they get one of their names. They aren't even in the same subfamily as lions, tigers, leopards, and jaguars (felinae for pumas and pantherinae for lions, tigers etc).

I understand what you're getting at, a ""all rectangles are squares but not all squares are rectangles"" kind of thing? 
But ""let's get snow leopards and pumas in there, then, too."" Is just kind of muddying the water a bit. 

Fun extra tidbit for those that don't know - pumas (also known as cougars, mountain lions and apparently some people call them panthers even though they're not) aren't classified as big cats because they can't roar, they purr like ordinary house cats. Big cats can roar because they have a long ligament instead of an epihyal bone, and their vocal cords are ""large, fleshy, and unbroken."" Where as cheetahs, cougars, and house cats have a fixed rigid voice box with divided vocal cords (which is why they can purr with both inhales and exhales). Snow leopards are weird though, they're classified as a big cat based on skull structure, apparently, but they can't roar or purr, they don't have fatty vocal cords and some scientists are arguing that they should have their very own genus."

They can say what they believe and give your psychiatrist insight and their opinion, but it comes down to your psychiatrist checking all the necessary boxes. If your psychiatrist diagnosed you with anxiety and depression and that's all they diagnosed, there's a reason for it. 
BPD shares a lot of traits with all the other personality disorders, they overlap all over the place so people are hesitant to just pin it on BPD if there are other, milder options. 

My psychiatrist asked my therapist to tell me about my new diagnosis so they could broach the subject of a new kind of therapy with me before my next psych appointment, (had therapy and three days later had psych appointment, it made sense to get me thinking about it so I could ask questions when I got to psych) otherwise my psychiatrist would have been the one to tell me and when my therapist did tell me, she made sure that I knew she was just the messenger and she wasn't the one that diagnosed me.

It crippled me instantly and I had to call out from work for two days until I could walk somewhat decently.
AskReddit,fo67rwf,t1_fo6523n,1587549733.0,"Oh, totally! 
My mom is stupid, for starters. We had a very narrow hallway when I was growing up, and she leaned three picture frames against the wall under the window. The one on the top was missing one side of the actual frame and the glass along the bottom corner was broken. 
I am a klutz. I've broken almost every single one of my toes at least once from stubbing them on things. 
I simply walked down the hallway, went to look out the window to see whatever my dog was barking at, and I stubbed my pinky toe. It felt like the most mild toe stub in the world. I looked down and shrugged but noticed a thin line of red running from between my toes towards the outside of my foot. 
So naturally I sat down and pulled my toe back to see what was up. It flopped off and hung by 5 mm of skin. 
I didn't know what to think or do so I just pounded on my mom's wall (she was still asleep) and told her, in a very calm voice, ""I think I need to go to the hospital. I just cut my toe off."" 
I kept asking what would happen to it and her lack of an answer made me cry (I was 9) and my brother's dad said ""when the shock wears off, you're going to hurt like a son of a bitch."" Which only made me cry more. I barely bled. It never hurt. 9 stitches later and I was sent home with the explicit instructions to make sure I stretched my Achilles tendon often because ""not keeping your foot at 90° for long periods of time will cause the tendon to shorten."" 
I have the tiniest of scars. I still have nerve damage, I can't really feel it unless I stub it super hard, or I know someone/thing is touching it and then my brain supplies the false feeling. I can still draw an accurate picture of what the inside of my toe looks like.


Edit: I forgot to say that the cut went through the cartilage, between the bones, so there was no real damage besides the, ya know, severing."

AskReddit,fo612cs,t1_fo5rbii,1587542539.0,"Shock + severed nerves, it's possible it didn't feel that much. 
I cut a toe off when I was a kid and never felt it because the nerve was severed, so I'm guessing other severed appendages act similar. I mean, there's phantom pain, but if the nerve was severed first (like mine was) would your brain conjure that kind of pain from nothing?"

AskReddit,fo1mrrc,t3_g4uku1,1587436714.0,"My new manager never applied for her job. My old manager was fired and they were supposed to wait 3 weeks for everything to be finalized so they could post the job, my assistant manager was waiting so he could apply, since he'd been the assistant for like 3 years. My new manager was an assistant in another location for about a year before moving over, but she's best friends with the store director (there's rumors they had/are having an affair) so before the paperwork was even finalized, the store director announced that she was the new manager. No one else was given a chance to apply, no one in other locations even knew it was happening until it was over. 

She's not cut out to be a manager and she plays favorites with her employees on an epic level. She's also petty, childish, and the most passive aggressive person I've ever met. I'm pretty sure there are rules about threatening to punch your employees in the face..."
WTF,fo1klw9,t1_fnzz2hz,1587435339.0,"I did until a few years later when she misdiagnosed my dogs cancer... 
He had a lump on the back of his leg and she said it was a lipoma,but did no testing. When I called back saying it was changing in size, like swelling and then shrinking, she said bring him in. When we got there she took 2 x-rays and charged me $400 (USD obviously) and said ""I just want to make sure it's not attached to the bone, if it is, it's bone cancer, and the x-rays will save you money because the other other thing to do is exploratory surgery."" 
That was already super weird to me, especially given how much she charged for the x-rays... 
She comes back and says ""it's not attached to the bone so it's not cancer. It's just a lipoma that swells with extra fluid, because of his diabetes."" 

My other dog had lipomas... They never swelled like that. I was suspicious so I went to another vet in town. He poked my dogs lump (now the size of a tennis ball) with a small needle, took a few cells, looked at it under a microscope and within 45 seconds he told me it was a mast cell tumor - it swelled and shrank based on his histamine levels and the vet couldn't figure out why or how my old vet didn't diagnose it for 3 months. That test cost me $20... I turned around and asked the receptionist (?) if she could get my pets medical files from my old vet transfered over so they had everything for all my pets and I never went back. It sucks because my family trusted that first vet for close to 20 years and it called into question all the times she said couldn't do anything for our pets. 

My pup beat the cancer. But he had some trouble with his heart and lungs, they said he might have a weak heart as a result of the medication. Two weeks before his 1 year (from diagnosis, 6 months after surgery) check up, he got pneumonia from all the smoke in the valley - health officials told everyone to wear masks if they were going outside, so we only let the dogs out for a few minutes at a time and had filtered air in the house, but he was already weak and susceptible. He was acting weird so I rushed him to the vet and he spent the whole day there in an oxygen chamber. My vet suggested I take him to his oncologist 2 hours away, because they had better equipment and more staff that could help overnight. He collapsed when we got him to my car, so the vet took him back inside but his lungs had been full of little sacs of fluid and when he collapsed they ruptured and he drown. My vet let me stay with him and cry for over an hour, well after everyone would have gone home, and they all just waited patiently. At some point they asked what I wanted to do and I signed a paper saying I'd like him cremated and the paw print thing. 
Two weeks later I got his ashes, a ceramic paw print, three stamped paw prints, and two cards of condolences. I asked what I owed, for the day of treatment and the after care, they said they would get back to me. Two weeks after that I asked again and they told me my vet took care of it.
