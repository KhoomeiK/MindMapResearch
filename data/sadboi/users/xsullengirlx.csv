But they had been in a serious relationship for a LONG time, they had talked about their future, having kids, getting married, etc. It's pretty clear that if she was understanding about her partner's past, and willing to wait to have any type of sex for like 7 months, that she loved him for who he IS. That is what their relationship was based off of. He FOUND that in her. Just because she doesn't feel the same now that she knows the truth doesn't mean she never loved him. It's clear she did. And giving up any sex for that long was selfless of her, and so her partner keeping the real truth from her for that long was selfish.

My ex was transgender (FtM) as well, and didn't tell me all of the details up front, but before things got super serious & before I started planning my life around them, they made sure to tell me. In that sense I didn't feel lied to. But if they had waited and let me plan my life and go on thinking something that was not true, I would have been upset and felt lied to.

Maybe ""failing to verify"" his penis wasn't a lie, technically. The LIE was when he had serious conversations with his partner about starting a family, and deliberately made it seem like they'd have biological kids together. He knew that is what his partner wanted and what she believed. So, going along with ""this is a cis - hetero relationship and we are going to have biological kids"" was a lie. Not just misleading.

When ALL the cheaper foods are sold, they are forced to buy more expensive food, to shop elsewhere, to pay delivery fees, etc. They ARE losing ""income"" too and affecting everyone."
disability,flqaaes,t1_fl5ig1o,1585385912.0,"EXACTLY. When the government and health organizations started to tell us to stock up for at least 2 weeks, it was in the middle of the month when most people on SSI/SSDI had already used all of their benefit money on rent and other bills, many people didn't expect this and may have used most their EBT funds by the middle of the month... And so everyone else started panic buying EVERYTHING cheap... while people waited for their SSI/SSDI checks for 2+ weeks, unable to stock up. So now that benefits are finally coming through, people are having to pay more for items that are left on the shelves, or pay for delivery, etc. Not to mention needing to stock up on medications and household cleaners, etc. There is absolutely a financial burden on people who receive SSI/SSDI even if their income doesn't change, their expenses do."
disability,flqa32u,t1_fkyayd7,1585385651.0,"But some people's SSDI doesn't even cover rent for a month, or they are left with under $100 for everything else. When the government recommends you stock up for at LEAST 2 weeks with food and essentials, many people on SSI/SSDI have already used their entire month's benefits on their rent and bills and can't AFFORD to stock up. It was the middle of the month when people may not have extra money budgeted for food or extras... Stocking up is not  a reality for most people who have disability as their entire income. And those people who have not been able to stock up these past 2-3 weeks as the rest of the world was panic buying? As soon as they get benefits at the beginning of the month, EVERYTHING cheap is gone. Shelves are empty. So you're forced to buy the more expensive products. To travel more to find food in multiple stores, to pay delivery fees, etc. 

Reality is, even if your income doesn't change, your EXPENSES will change in a time like this, unless you had money in savings before all this went down. This affects everyone."

My friend and some of these bar regulars know the owners and employees, so they take their sweet time getting their food orders while they drink and mingle. They say the police don't want to come around and enforce it, so they're going to keep doing it. She told me the names of these bars, too.

He still needs to be monitored on his liver medication, and isn't even on heart medication yet, because after his x-rays, the vet wants him to get an echocardiogram before prescribing heart medications. It's cost me every cent I have (and into debt) to pay for his visits, prescriptions, prescription food, etc - and now I can't continue with his care and diagnoses because I can't afford to feed the both of us, too. Not when we have to stock up. I just bought him 12 cans of his special food for $45, and bought myself $20 of food - which was all I could get because the shelves at 3 stores were almost empty.

When I got home, I washed my hands, took the container out of the bag, transferred the food to my own plate, disposed of the container and bag outside immediately, washed my hands again, then I heated up my food in the microwave for good measure.
