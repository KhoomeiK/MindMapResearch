BPD,fbbl8qh,t1_fbajs62,1576702777.0,"I recently got diagnosed with BPD and reading this makes me think about all the moments I've seeked validation from authority figures especially a teacher I had. I got so close to a teacher that when he wouldn't give me the attention I wanted I would get angry and would even lash out. After lashing out I would feel embarrassed but would go back to the same circle. It didn't end well.
It all makes sense now."
