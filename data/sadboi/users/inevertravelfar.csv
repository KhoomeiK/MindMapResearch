depression,fi8cevu,t3_exo6f1,1582237577.0,"I was going to work on writing some music this evening, and now it's almost 10:30pm and I just don't see the point. Because they're probably not going to be very good, and no one will really care if I do or don't, so why bother?"
AskReddit,fgnqlt7,t1_fgmyp4k,1580950709.0,"My ex did this to me, twice. She went one further and told me she was also pregnant when she wasn't. The first time was to cover a lie she had told someone else, the second was just to screw with my head.

I cannot recall having ever been so hurt or so angry in my life."
depression,fczc3un,t3_cml6ni,1578097928.0,"I go back to work tomorrow after two weeks on leave, and I would rather cut off my own legs than go back. I'm not just pissed off that over the past few months I have worked basically every other weekend, I know it's going to be a nightmare because the IT system is down indefinitely, and apparently there are more ""issues"", which I've been on edge about since I got told this morning. I've spent probably the past two weeks counting down to going back to work an dreading it. I hate my job anyway, it's a tedious and soulless waste of time, I don't need more fucking stress, and I don't really know how to escape from this situation because most jobs feel that way to me.

I was watching an interview yesterday where one of the people talking said that people in their twenties and thirties spend their whole lives worried that good things are happening somewhere where they're not, and they're missing it. And that's how I feel."
depression,f9md1ob,t3_cml6ni,1575452571.0,"I’m at work right now and I could quite happily just go home. This morning I could have just spent the rest of the day going back and forth on the bus instead of getting off at my stop, because it would’ve been preferable to being here. 

It’s mostly because I keep thinking about my ex this morning and I really, really fucking miss her and want it to stop hurting."
depression,f9mclc8,t3_e5i6vs,1575451880.0,"Yeah, it can be tough. I used to really look forward to Christmas as a kid, but the shine has worn off somewhat and that upsets me.

The past couple have been worse since I broke up with my ex too, Christmas had been the last time I felt as if we were happy together and it makes me miss her, a lot."
depression,f90p9rl,t1_f8z7e12,1574975437.0,"""If I hadn't seen such riches, I could live with being poor.""

I have a few things I'm excited about, but one of the worst things about being depressed is that you don't enjoy them as much as you want to for whatever reason, or you can't pursue them in the way that you would like to. And it's absolute agony."
depression,f8yq64f,t3_cml6ni,1574951241.0,"I just ruined an £85 pair of shoes. I just couldn't leave them alone and now they're wrecked and I'm in a terrible mood.

I also feel ridiculous that I feel so down over a pair of fucking shoes."
depression,f6n6kst,t3_cml6ni,1572985649.0,"As far as anyone knows, I'm over my ex, but I'm not and I don't think I ever will be. She lied, she was manipulative and she was self-absorbed, but I miss her every day and wish that we hadn't broken up. Especially at this time of year, I don't like being by myself and feeling so empty and lonely. I'm just so down right now and a lot of it is because of that, having a relationship was my ticket to being a normal, proper human being and now I don't have that anymore."
depression,f2v7fex,t3_cml6ni,1570447742.0,"Everything is a mess, I don't know where to start fixing it. I just completely lost my temper because I couldn't spraypaint something properly.

I just want something to go right. Just once."
depression,f1w0a9u,t3_danzk1,1569778469.0,"I think about it a lot, but I'm not sure I ever would. Apart from it not necessarily fixing anything, I'm not sure I would find what I'm looking for. I think to a large extent I'm afraid that I would go to a place with a particular idea of how it is in my head, I would be disillusioned when I find that it's not that way."
depression,f1ut4pc,t3_cml6ni,1569763312.0,"I had been talking to a girl for a month or so and I thought we were getting along OK, but I think she's ghosted me. I know it's silly because we haven't been talking long, but it does hurt. I'm not even sure what I did wrong.

I thought I was doing alright but I guess I wasn't."
depression,ez40nnb,t3_cml6ni,1567678851.0,"I don't know what to do. Everything is wrong and I don't know how to fix any of it, or if I even can."
depression,eqs9c24,t3_bzbuiw,1560279679.0,"Constantly.

Today I had the day off work and it was cold and rainy all day, so I thought last night that I could at least spend the day trying to find a new job, or just do something productive no matter how basic. I've done nothing. Really nothing. This is a common occurrence, I just can't bring myself to do things."
depression,epu90oq,t3_bvup45,1559505874.0,"If I'm enjoying something I'm also not, because I know it has to end, or because there's something about it that isn't how I would like. I can't fully enjoy sports or music because I wish it was me and I wasn't just consuming it; a lot of the time if I'm doing something alone I want someone else to share it with.

Being afraid of things ending is a huge struggle because I spend so long being concerned with them being ""right"" and preparing for them that they're gone before I can experience them. ""Life is what happens while you're busy making other plans."""
TrueOffMyChest,ep7d2h3,t1_eouh18q,1559080256.0,"The thing is, it's not that tough a life. Even though I'm not happy with them I have a home and I have a job, and I feel a bit guilty for being dissatisfied because I could have so much less than I do. 

But you're right, I worry about the future a lot and I do find it hard not to compare myself to others. I've spent most of my life being compared, or feeling as if I was being compared, to other people and I suppose it became easy for me to do that."
TrueOffMyChest,ep789df,t1_eos4k63,1559078545.0,"I've seen a few therapists, with varying levels of success. I think the therapies I've had aren't really the kind of thing I need.

I still worry I'll never get over her, it's been this long and she just screwed with my head so badly. I never even considered that she - or anyone - might do the things she did, it was just so weird. I hadn't envisioned the relationship ever ending, much less ending in the way it did."
