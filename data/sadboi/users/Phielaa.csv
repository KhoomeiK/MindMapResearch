EatingDisorders,fqhbkj2,t3_givuuy,1589373332.0,My mom helped me. During the lockdown i struggled a lot with it. I overcame this by eating all my meals with her and talking about all the other things there are to talk about. Not sure if this can help you but the sense of structure during a structureless time helped me a lot!
