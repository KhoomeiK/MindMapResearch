It makes life pretty difficult and confusing, and most days I feel like an abhorrent mix of things that just do not go together. I waste time making decisions by trying to decide what decision to make. Even the most insignificant things. I get bored all the time now. I used to be fine with sitting in front of a tv and playing video games all day, or watching a show; just not thinking. But now I’m constantly switching between little activities throughout my day to just get my mind to shut the fuck up for TWO SECONDS. 

And you don’t know how many posts I’ve made and deleted, and all the comments I never share, just like this one. I sometimes think sharing my feelings with other people will help me the most.
