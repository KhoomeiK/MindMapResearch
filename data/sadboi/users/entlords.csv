I thought there is something seriously wrong with me when I first started getting intrusive thoughts but after years of therapy (and medication) and finding people who are going through the same thing as me. I have found so much relief and peace from my intrusive thoughts, they still pop up every know and then but hey I just let the thoughts float by now."

I have spent time in jail due too OCD intrusive thoughts then acting on them, so yes I personally too care when someone‚Äôs says they are ‚ÄúOCD‚Äù just because they organised the wardrobe, and sorted there clothes doesn‚Äôt make them
OCD. There is a lot more too OCD then just keeping things ‚Äúclean and organised‚Äù as people think, I have acted on my intrusive thoughts and spent a long time locked up because of those actions. And people with OCD too care about how you use the word OCD. It is a serious life-long mental disorder with serious debilitating symptoms. I take a massive cocktail of drugs everyday, Zoloft, Valium, Xanax and I still struggle with violent intrusive thoughts everyday. So please take OCD seriously it is not some joke. And everyone struggling with OCD. You are not alone! Message me if you want too talk too someone who has gone through the same struggles (I am still struggling) but there is strength in numbers!"
