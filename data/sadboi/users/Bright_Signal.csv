SuicideWatch,fgoasgn,t3_ezmm67,1580964157.0,"To start, please don’t apologize. You’re allowed to have feelings about the things that go on in your life. If you ever do feel very desperate, definitely try to talk to a trusted friend or the suicide hotline. You can even talk to me if you want :). As far as tips, maybe try telling your parents about how you feel when they say things like that. As a child of African parents myself, I totally get that it can be a little scary to stand up to your parents, but maybe try. Or you could try doing something that brings you joy, like listening to your favorite music or watching an episode of a show you enjoy. I hope things get better for you"
