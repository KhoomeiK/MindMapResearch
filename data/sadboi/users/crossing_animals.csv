It's a beautiful day amongst the falling gun poweder and corpses, and through the bullet ridden trees that laced a park that you once was lush and craddling a lake you called home.
And you are still, after all these years, a horrible goose.

You strech your wings wide and give a honk,
It's been your own battle cry since birth. 
""To the next place I go,"" you tell yourself. And so, your journey continues.On the way you do your usual buisness: Pick pocketing fallen soliders of the resistance for any snacks. You're a natural at finding meals from the deceased, but lately a thought has ran around in your head- one that you've been trying to push out so desperately. You want to find others for your own entertainment. That's all these silly little humans are: entertainment! 

And yet, it would be nice once in a while to have someone feed you something instead. 
Once there was that old lady who would visit you.
She came with cracked corn and frozen peas. 
A mirthful thing, she was, her wrinkled hands clapping while she observed you eating. 
You shake your billed head. 
""No...someone like her wouldn't have survived. She was too frail.""

Yet still, deep within your tender goose breast,
There is a wish for just one person to peak their head out from a half disintegrated phonebox. Or perhaps someone sheltered within a looted shop of TVs. Even the thought of pesky Gardener, with his handlbar mustache and booming voice, putting aside old differences to feed you is a nice thought. 

You shake your head, and shake your tail too. 
""No, even if I did find them they would just chase me away. They always do, anyways. Come on, Goose. Pull yourself together here.""

It's a lonely day today. A discarded red ribbon twists and turns in the smokey scented breeze. The dry ground cracks and crumbles under your webbed feet, the only sound that follows you as you waddle along crumbling asphalt. 

Maybe you aren't as horrible of a goose as you thought..."

OCD,fjeb2mh,t3_fcryyw,1583268516.0,"I think I may have a variet of this, in which sometimes have the obsessive thought that I will ""shift"" out of my current mindset and into a different (distressing) mindset that will change how I physically behave as well as how others see me. For example if I watch something on TV and sympathize with a character who may not have the best morals, that I will suddenly turn into that character and be refered to by that character's name. Bonus points if it's a male character, because than I have the worry that people will start using he/him pronouns around me. The scariest one, though, is when I do not even feel human but as a being of nothingness. That thought is rare, but one of my scarier obsessions because being nothing terrifies me.  

 It's less of ""what if we all ceased existing"" for me, but more so ""what if *I* cease to exist as me"". Either way, it's a terrifying obsessive thought to have and I totally understand the paranoia and fear behind the thought of having no existance or a corrupted existance."
OCD,fje9ypg,t3_fcyfig,1583267901.0,"If you know you are straight without a doubt, than it is likely you are still straight and will keep being straight. The best advice I have gotten when I used to have HOCD is ""what's the worst that can happen""? Obviously, the worst that can happen is that you find put that you're not 100% straight and that's okay. That's not a bad thing at all! You are definitely straight, as thinking about the same sex causes you distress, but if the worst comes true and you find our you're not straight in the end- nothing will change. People will still love you regardless and nothing about you is depraived. The worst isn't that bad, should it happen...but like I said based on this post it probably has no chance of happening.

For the record, I identify as bi NOW. But when I was younger and I was in an environment with a lot of homophobic people, I had HOCD thoughts. My advice still stands regardless of anything, though.
