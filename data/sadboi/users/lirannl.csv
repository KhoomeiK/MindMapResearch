I understand your concern, but what's the alternative to opening up? Waiting until complete elimination of the virus? Because that means we'll remain locked down forever.

> is generally concerned about a second wave

A second wave will happen when restrictions get relaxed. There's no way around it. Lock the country down for a year like Italy 1 month ago, make Australia a shithole, and if you try to reopen, even slightly, you'll still get a second wave. The only thing that could prevent that is waiting in total lockdown until we get a vaccine. Instead what we're seeing is several states recording no new cases for days, alongside an amazingly low number of active cases. No land borders with Europe or the US is a very helpful thing too.

I'm not crediting the current liberal government for our relatively amazing situation, by the way. They're just barely competent. It's just that what they have to work with is an amazing country, both overall (I say this as a binational person. I know what's it like elsewhere), and covid-wise.

When you have Australia to work with, to fuck it up entirely is going to be very difficult. You'd have to be extremely incompetent. Like Donald Trump. Our Prime Minister is not great, not good, not someone I support, but he does cross one very, very low bar - he's not as bad as Donald Trump. We have so much going for us. Physical isolation from the US and Europe, gun control (we're not getting armed protests to remove all restrictions immediately), a functioning public healthcare system...

Seriously, to get us to have a covid failure story like Spain, Italy, Iran, or of course the USA, it would not be trivial. Someone would need to deliberately take action and actively ensure we're behaving the same way."

The screen being broken, on the other hand, can't be affected by software one way or another.

If my speakers stopped working, they can't claim that it's because I rooted my phone. If it happened because I over boosted the speakers' volume, some other wire would fry before things ever get to the speakers.

Basically the only software thing that can cause hardware damage is excessive overclocking of things.

Now, if I hard bricked my phone, sure, I can't expect them to replace the NAND chip with a new one with a working system, because that's my fault, but that's software. It's not the NAND chip itself that's the problem, it's the data on it (or lack thereof)."
