selfharm,fl8xrly,t3_fna25o,1584935064.0,"yes, i feel like a lot of people look at it like that.
there’s also one girl i know that had 1 (not v deep) scar on her arm and kept on saying she cut. 
Tbh i consider there’s no behavior in sh that u could call unnecessary or not worth to worry about because cutting is always for some reason, obviously mostly because of depression etc. and wanting to get rid of the things u feel, but even if it’s just for attention it’s something wrong and that should be taken care for... at least that’s what i think of. 
but it still hurts to see people (this 1 girl) to go around and say “see, i cut myself” bc it’s something u just don’t brag about. not saying that it’s wrong, but yk, u dun do it bc u wanna show off! there’s also another girl in my school i heard that does it and “shows off” and it’s scaring me a bit bc imagine, if they saw my scars/cuts once they would prolly think too it’s just part of this weird trend etc.
Please, even tho i don’t think anyone from those persons will read this anyways, don’t think it’s something not that serious or whatever... it just hurts to see ppl deal w it as if it was just a teenager thing and nothing important. it just hurts. bc when i see ppl w real scars i almost break down to tears and want to hug & comfort them. and when i see people that recovered, go around sleeveless and tattooed something on their arm to remind themselves they’re strong, i look up to them and would love to ask them how they did it. and it’s not something u just do because... others do it or it’s cool or whatever."

Subliminal,fktsezr,t3_fkdk3g,1584533095.0,"Please don’t, and try to stop other people from doing it too. The reason behind that is simple.
We don’t want subliminals to get popular, and I’m not blaming it on your friends, but if everybody tells their friends and so on, it might become popular, and people might take advantage for it. Even at this point, where only a few thousand people know about subliminals, we’re able to find several ones with hidden bad subliminal messages, and some of them really scary results. I don’t know if you knew about this yet, but there are a few accounts on youtube that gave people weird feelings, weird results, bad karma etc. So that’s basically the reason why we don’t want our subs to become popular. And you can’t even really figure out by your own if they have bad hidden messages, because the little voice is overplayed by some music etc.!
And besides the hidden messages, we also want our community to be little because it’s, like our little secret. I don’t know if it’s selfish or not, but if you get for example a glow up, but everybody knows it’s just because of some audio you listened to, everyone else will be able to do so and it might not be something special anymore. This point is not so important, but the first one definitely is, trust me! (there are hidden messages with even more scary results which I don’t really wanna list, but you can search them by your own. But there are rumors that some might even lead to suicide/suicidal thoughts, mentioning it so that everyone can understand how important it is to keep our community as little as possible.)
If you still want them to know about it, please just let them find out by their own! After all we all (in this community) know about it and i think at least most of us found out about it by coincidence, so it’s popular enough to pop up in someone’s recommendation etc.
Hope you have a great day!💕"
