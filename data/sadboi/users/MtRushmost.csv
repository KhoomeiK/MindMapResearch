She told me the best stories and one day explained to me that her home city was on the coast.  She said chicken was for rich people and crab was for poor people (since there was so much on the coast).  Everyone who could afford chicken kept some around until company came, but if someone saw you eating crab then they would know you didnt have any money that day.  But here in my city crab is like $30+ a cluster and a mcchicken is a dollar."
