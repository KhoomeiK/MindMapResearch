BPD,fmwrxvk,t1_fmwr3qf,1586451964.0,"Something thats helped for me is asking to have a minute the moment I start dissociating, no matter how the conversation is going. Then I leave the situation-- again, even if it was going well because I have no idea what I'm saying when dissociated-- and find a place to be alone.

At that point, I can assess my perspective. Am I assuming they're trying to hurt me? Do I know for sure what the other party is feeling? Am I superimposing what I think is happening/assuming what they're thinking?

I try to look at the situation from my perspective, then there's with the assumption that they have the best or neutral intentions. Then I look from their perspective if they also felt attacked, stressed, or anxious. 

That normally calms me down enough and gets my head on straight enough to be able to go back to the conversation, ask what they're hearing/feeling, and then explain what I'm hearing and feeling.

BPD ruins everything about perspective because you're waiting for the rug to ripped from under your feet. You have to disengage and take the time to remember that most other people don't want to do that to you at all."
BPD,fmwpu3h,t3_fxtifu,1586450902.0,"It hurts to be told things like that and its difficult when you're acting on fight or flight and can't even get back into your own body.

I get that, I understand and empathize.

That said, violence can never be accepted or brushed away. A conversation can not be made with hands. I've been there. You cannot give yourself leeway or understanding in this, it has to be something you take full responsibility for and make active changes to stop. 

Remember that its easier to forgive verbal mistakes than physical. Once you've put your hands on someone, that's who you are to them. You've broken trust in the same way that would make you aggressively remove them from your life.

BPD cannot be the reason you give for your actions, because that doesn't excuse them. You are not a horrible person. You deserve love and to be heard but no ears open for fists."

BPD,ethfslb,t3_cbowj3,1562814287.0,"I have BPD and am also poly. The most important thing in any poly relationship is communication. Always, always, always open communication or you lose trust and everything goes to shit.

Jealousy is not just a BPD thing, it‚Äôs a human thing and it is so common in poly relationships it‚Äôs almost hilarious.

Tell your partner that you feel insecure because she always looks so happy after seeing that person and also explain how you see your relationship being rocky lately and how that‚Äôs making you feel more insecure.

It might also be good to explain this, but I‚Äôm mostly just adding it to remind you: you are only one side of the story. She might not see you guys in as rocky a place as you do, this joy from a new connection could easily just be her enjoying the honeymoon period, and as much as she knows things about BPD, she cannot and will never be able to read your mind or experience the world the way you do.

If she‚Äôs comfortable to do this, ask if you guys can talk (surface level) about her interactions with other partners (though that might be a stretch/controlling if you rely on it too heavily) or if you can just spend some quality time with each other afterwards. 

Talk about your sexual frustration (but spend a lot of time working that out in your head so you don‚Äôt pressure her and also mention that you aren‚Äôt trying to pressure as much as just be open. Because you need to be open.) and if you‚Äôre both amenable, full out sex is very rarely a necessity tbh. Especially in poly relationships, people get tired. It‚Äôs not really a sex thing; even emotional exhaustion from being available to care a lot about several people can wear you out despite being fulfilling.

This is turning into an essay, but again, think through some things, ***write things down*** because speech and getting points across without getting lost or flustered can be difficult, and express that you are struggling and need support.

Also figure out an accountability code for her to hold you to (that isn‚Äôt too harsh on yourself) as far as outbursts go. If you lash out maybe there‚Äôs a phrase she can say (ex.‚Äúthis is getting a bit heated. Let‚Äôs revisit it later.‚Äù) followed by a confirmation that you haven‚Äôt actually ruined anything (ex. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre okay, we just need to talk later‚Äù) to end the convo before you say anything you can‚Äôt come back from. And you hold yourself to it by being the one to go elsewhere, calm down with an activity that actually does calm you, think on it, and then reopen the conversation maturely with your thoughts in order. ***Even if that‚Äôs a day or more later***.

I‚Äôm going to cut myself off here but I really wanted to answer this if only because of all the comments sideeyeing poly. If you really aren‚Äôt comfortable with it and can‚Äôt see it happening, the both of you need to rethink a lot of things to stay together, but otherwise, I hope this helps. Good luck!

BPD,etbd32t,t3_caprto,1562643228.0,"Before I actually accepted my diagnosis, there was a girl with a similar traumatic past to mine. Like so similar that I immediately took her under my wing and decided I‚Äôd help her since I was older and when I was her age no one helped me.

While I was busy reveling in the feeling of getting to white knight for what I had decided was a different version of myself basically, I realized that she wasn‚Äôt actually like me. She got help constantly and had no qualms about asking for it. And because I originally made myself available to her, those requests for help went to me. 

I very quickly realized I wanted her to be identical to me so I could save myself. I wouldn‚Äôt have asked for help. I wouldn‚Äôt have shown ‚Äòweakness‚Äô unless I was alone. And then I split. And hard too, in the middle of her telling me about someone who‚Äôd made her feel like shit and had her feeling more depressed than usual, I felt 100% of my care for her drain out of me.

I later got called out on how cold I was to her and I tried really hard to explain why because she felt like a horrible person to me and I couldn‚Äôt even remember what I liked about her.

Made a lot more sense after revisiting the topic of BPD. Even now, I can‚Äôt really deal with her and we don‚Äôt talk. I sort of regret it but the utter snap from ‚Äúprotect this child‚Äù to ‚Äúshe‚Äôs using me, manipulating me, she doesn‚Äôt need protection‚Äî I do‚Äù was instant and permanent, I think. 

If there‚Äôs anything about BPD that‚Äôs actively terrifying to me, it‚Äôs that I have the ability to do this whether I want to or not. It feels like you have to have years of experiences with someone in a few months to a couple years otherwise you‚Äôll just lose interest/trust for little to no reason."
BPD,et8vv99,t3_cae7sy,1562572762.0,"Every single bit of it, to the t, yes. 

I want consistency but I dread and hate consistency. To have a routine‚Äî specifically a routine that involves other people‚Äî pushes me to this weird headspace where I feel unsafe, unhappy, and stagnant.

And then it becomes a month that‚Äôs a blur of nothing and negative feelings until I think I‚Äôm suffocating. 

So I plan and revise and plan and revise my fallback plan of suicide until I‚Äôm content that I can get out of it in a way that gives me the least hassle and most rest/rewards.

I‚Äôm currently in school for a useless major and a semi useless minor. I have no idea why I‚Äôm even in school, picking up debt, because I have no idea what I want to do and no interests strong enough to get me through four years. 

Every time I think ‚Äúgosh maybe I should try something else,‚Äù I immediately shut it down with, ‚ÄúI promised myself if I‚Äôm still in a tailspin in five years, I‚Äôll call it quits.‚Äù That give me Carte Blanche to do whatever because I go back and forth between wanting to hit that limit and wanting to live multiple times a week if not a day. 

All of that culminates into a stalemate of me continuing to do shit that 100% won‚Äôt help in the future. I‚Äôm almost looking forward to still being fucked up if only because I‚Äôve already wasted so much time and money I can‚Äôt really see a way out."

That‚Äôs just my prerogative though, moving on. Based on the assumptions I‚Äôve made, I‚Äôd say leave. Frankly, you‚Äôre going to cheat again. I think your boyfriend might already be in a victim mindset that won‚Äôt end until he‚Äôs wasted a lot of his life trying to change you or until you make it end. 

For his sake but also for yours, leave. And leave after explaining to him why you‚Äôre leaving without blaming him or putting him down in anyway. Do not change your mind. I don‚Äôt think you need to be in a relationship right now unless it‚Äôs an established casual relationship that will not go anywhere near something serious.

Canning,erw4b2t,t1_ervq9u4,1561332845.0,"The Syrup: 

* 6 Lemons (I did *not* use Meyer, but if you do the syrup will be a bit sweeter/less tart)
* \~60 oz/3 lb honey

It's pretty simple, so none of this is exact. Get a large dish that you can put a cover on (I used a Tupperware container) and set that aside. 

Wash your lemons very well, soap then baking soda, then top and tail them. Slice them as thin as you possibly can, the thinner they are, the faster this goes. (if you're going to make the marmalade, reserve the seeds and any pith you can remove without compromising the slices too much)

Make one layer of honey on the bottom of your container, then press the lemons into it. Cover with honey, then press another layer of lemon slices into it (it'll make your life easier when you turn them if you stack each layer as close to on top of each other as you can). Repeat until you've completely used all your lemons.

Turn the lemon stacks over once an hour for four hours at room temperature, then pop them into the fridge for twelve hours. Every time you turn them, you'll notice the honey is more liquidy/runny. Make sure to get your spoon/fork/etc to the bottom of the container when you turn them because that's where the honey that hasn't been infused is sitting. Be sure to taste the infused honey every turn to make sure it's not getting bitter!

After 12 hours, flip the lemons once more, leave them at room temperature for an hour, and they are-- technically-- done.

They can actually be eaten just like that, rind and all, or added to water at that point (I highly recommend you try at least one slice at this point, they really wake you up haha). If you just want the syrup, remove the lemons and set aside for marmalade or whatever else you can make out of them.

I also went ahead and poured the syrup into a large pot and heated it up just to make sure everything was properly incorporated, then followed typical jarring procedure.

&#x200B;

The Marmalade:

* Lemons from the syrup (about 2 cups)
* \~1/4 cup of the actual syrup
* \~1/4 cup liquid pectin (or put the reserved seeds and pith into a tea bag and throw that in)
* \~1.5 cups sugar
* \~2 cups water

Again, not exact because I pretty much just eyeball the whole affair. 

Chop up the lemon slices into manageable, marmalade sized pieces and chuck them into a medium pot. Add the water and syrup to the pot and bring them up to a simmer, keep your heat around medium/medium low.

Periodically remove any scum that arises and remove any darker bits of pith as it cooks (those will go bitter.)

Keep cooking the lemons for \~20-40 minutes, really depends on when you're happy with how soft they are. Remember that this is going on a slice of bread (probably) and trust your judgement from there. 

Add the sugar (if you're using the reserved seeds and pith, this is your moment. Throw in the teabag and tie it to the pot handle so you don't have to go searching for it later). Don't skimp on the sugar or it won't set.

Continue cooking at medium low until the mixture is a medium golden color. Add your pectin if you're using it, stir well, and cook for 5 more minutes (note that I normally don't use liquid pectin so I'll let you know if mine sets up well in a couple days.)

From there, follow standard canning procedure and you're done!"

It doesn‚Äôt really register as fucked up for me on a personal level because I don‚Äôt really care much about morals, but I‚Äôve had people tell me things that they look terrified to say and had background realizations that anyone else would literally eviscerate them for having said it.

I accept, advise, comfort, whatever they need because I see someone hurting and get this weird mix of adrenaline and possessiveness. I get happy almost when they tell me about their issues because that means I‚Äôm important to them.

My GP decided that, because I showed accountability and came back she would trust me to make it to my appointment. I promised her that much and I take promises fairly seriously, so she seemed less ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna make you help yourself‚Äù and let me leave.

I‚Äôm sorry you had to go through inpatient, it‚Äôs soul draining but I‚Äôm glad you found something hat worked for you; I‚Äôm hoping what I‚Äôve already got set up will get me moving in the right direction.

And because I never thought about it like that until recently, it never fails to make me this intense kind of furious-depressed where I‚Äôm so mad I have heartburn but too sad to do anything but cry.

Ironically, because of some of the ways they fucked me up, I judge myself for crying/weakness and end up repressing all that emotion so it gets worse every time I think about it."

So I frequently tell people I‚Äôll answer anything without getting offended (not because I‚Äôm a patron saint like I lead them to believe, but because I love oversharing with an excuse) but depending on the conversation have to adjust so that they understand if they criticize my mother more than like, ‚Äúyeah that‚Äôs a bit shit,‚Äù I will go off.

And the thing is, even when they criticize her and I agree, I still get mad because they have no right to say anything at all about her. I said all that to explain it literally took me a full day to stop ignoring this response and actually read/research.

And boy oh boy, I spent most of the article scoffing and mocking like, ‚Äúthat‚Äôs someone else‚Äôs mom, my mom was hurting but she did the best she could.‚Äù Even though I have thought several times that she has something at least similar to BPD. 

Once I removed my head from my colon, it‚Äôs pretty obvious that she is 50% the hermit 50% waif(with a couple things from some of the others). So much so that while reading it I felt like I wrote it but with slightly less idolization.

I‚Äôm literally white knighting for her at all times because my brother isn‚Äôt as attached so I‚Äôm always thinking without me there‚Äôd be no one there for her.

Not that I have that info... uh, I don‚Äôt know actually. I‚Äôm gonna bring it up when I start going back to therapy next month, the list of things is always growing longer haha


I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs as bad as she could be because we left the entirety of our family bar my brother for the most part, so without me she‚Äôd be alone. I can‚Äôt imagine going through your situation, I‚Äôm sorry you had to but the fact that you‚Äôre here on the other side even if it‚Äôs rough says a lot about your strength of mind.

There‚Äôs also writing DAEs that you haven‚Äôt seen (which is nerve wracking) and having no one or only one person agree because, again, that means it‚Äôs all you (or a different disorder).

The way I look at it, no one else has my specific medley of disorders in the same way/ at the same intensity. So, even if I am just a mishmash of symptoms, I‚Äôm not quite a clone just yet."

I do my best but in truth I just feel like I‚Äôm trying to press the right buttons in a game because I‚Äôm completely uninvested even though it‚Äôs my life.

Smile, laugh, anger, indignation, grief, sadness, etc; they all feel like I‚Äôm faking somehow, even if I‚Äôm alone.

&#x200B;

I'm aware I'm hurting people when I just up and disappear but I justify it to myself by thinking about how much worse I'd hurt them if I was there. The only reason I'm not too concerned about it and am just enjoying it right now is it never lasts too long when I have social obligations. I'm in uni so once I get off break, I will have to see people, go to clubs, classes, etc. I'm not worried because there's a limit to how long this mood can last. I can't imagine how much scarier/easier to continue it would be if I didn't have that limitation."

And it can last for a pretty good while, especially if I was around people for an extended period of time before hand (which I was, dorms are hell)

&#x200B;

When I'm low though, isolating is the worst thing in the world for me. I just can't really remember what it feels like right now because that's not where I am, you know? I understand where you're coming from though, I hope you catch a break at some point as well :)"
