abusiverelationships,fpiodew,t1_fpgkd18,1588645149.0,"Hey friend, Iâ€™m really sorry to say, but sheâ€™s probably going to behave this way for all of the relationship - I mean, unless something drastic happens or thereâ€™s a serious conversation. As a person who used to have emotional outbursts and would get upset about little things because it didnâ€™t fit with my expectations, there are deeper issues there. And it takes a lot of work, patience, and awareness to manage that behaviour and communicate more effectively without hurting people, and falling prey to ones own emotions. Sheâ€™s an adult, and can use big words to describe her feelings, itâ€™s hard at first, but we can learn. She doesnâ€™t have to act this way, there is no real excuse as we can become more introspective and aware of whatâ€™s going on with ourselves and how that impacts others. You just need to want it. It doesnâ€™t look like she does if sheâ€™s consistently behaving like this. Itâ€™s not your job to manage her mental health and bad behaviour and itâ€™s not your job to try and appease her when sheâ€™s like that. She should realise that that behaviour is shit, and that she needs to change if she wants either of you to be happy in the future. I was actually dumped because I didnâ€™t manage my shit, and it was the right thing to do in all honesty. Even if you love them, if the person isnâ€™t looking after themselves and have no intention to, then youâ€™re better off without them because youâ€™ll just become a casualty. Just my opinion. Hope youâ€™re okay duder!"
abusiverelationships,fpinc3r,t1_fpi2ob6,1588644510.0,"That is understandable, but I think that if youâ€™re reacting in such a way where you begin abusing your partner without considering their feelings it becomes problematic, and while itâ€™s great to understand it, itâ€™s not OPs obligation to rectify her emotions and behaviour; that is her issue to solve, and no amount of love and caring from one side can fix that. She needs to manage her expectations and understand why sheâ€™s being pretty mean, even if she thinks itâ€™s justified, that behaviour isnâ€™t alright. It seems like sheâ€™s pushing insecurities, and that needs to be solved by nobody but herself, itâ€™s not cool to push that onto others, even if itâ€™s a loved one."

Iâ€™ve been without my ex for over 7 months, and not talking to them or having the same type of connection has been the normal, but I canâ€™t help thinking about them every goddamn day, and I canâ€™t help but miss who they were with me. Thatâ€™s the thing though, I have no real connection with them currently, so I feel like weâ€™re strangers now, but Iâ€™m so fond of who they were before, when we were in love and happy. Itâ€™s sad to lose that, no matter how you slice it, it sucks and it takes time for us to organically lose those feelings. I know my ex isnâ€™t good for me, and that we shouldnâ€™t get back together, but I miss those beautiful moments I had with them, and I guess weâ€™re sad because we wonâ€™t have that with them again, itâ€™s different forever. But, feelings change, evidently since weâ€™re here, so I have hope that itâ€™ll naturally reduce over time, and eventually there will be another who completely smashes our expectations to catch our heart. 

I donâ€™t really know what to do with this feeling though hey haha. Itâ€™s so shitty."
BorderlinePDisorder,fpesznn,t3_gd0zou,1588554286.0,"Hey there, I can relate, I have BPD and have struggled with outbursts of emotion (anger/rage) for a long time, as that was what I learnt from my parent, and it has become a natural way for my body to react. 

Currently, I am actively working on this issue. Things that help for me are:

1) changing my perspective - a lot of the time I get worked up is when I put a lot of pressure or stress on myself for a specific thing. For example, Iâ€™m running late for work and I start getting angry and frustrated because I canâ€™t find things and Iâ€™m rushing, and then I explode; this is because I am stressed about being late to work, either because I like being punctual, and donâ€™t want to be seen as late and not a good worker. However, if I change my perspective and accept that I may be late and that itâ€™s not a catastrophe, then the world doesnâ€™t seem so stressful. Putting less stress on yourself helps. We tend to make things into a much bigger deal than it is, Iâ€™m not saying weâ€™re wrong or anything, our feelings are valid and they originate from somewhere - and thatâ€™s what we need to know, why are we feeling this way? What is it that it causing you this stress? Then try to tackle that issue and mindset, and try to shift your perspective. 

2) give yourself a moment to reset and calm down. Give yourself some time and space away from others, and breathe. Whatâ€™s upsetting you? Can we shift this mindset? Feel your emotion, acknowledge it, and try to let it go. Try and understand why youâ€™re feeling this way, itâ€™ll be helpful when youâ€™re trying to grow in those areas - you will know whatâ€™s causing these reactions. 

3) be kind to yourself. It takes a lot of energy for us to go through this, donâ€™t best yourself up for too long about it. We can only accepted it happened and learn from it. We can grow from each of our set backs or outbursts, whatever it is. Use it to learn about yourself and grow. 

Hope youâ€™re okay, and if you ever need to chat feel free to message :)"
