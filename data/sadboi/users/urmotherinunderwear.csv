AskReddit,fpwuoz7,t3_gfsi0q,1588970306.0,"When I was a kid, I  had a old game of truth or dare that had a lie detector that made loud noises and had flashing lights. You needed to turn it on, it makes a loud noise and then you push a button. You wait for the ""truth"" or ""lie"" noise. I never realy played at it so it was in a curtain in the wall behind my desk so it was pretty hard to reach. It was there for a LONG TIME  and OFF.
One night, I am sleeping peacefully when a loud noise wakes me up. I am confused and scarded, thinking that the fire alarm is on, that my house is on fire! I switch the lights of my room up and realise that the sound comes from my own room...
It has been ~10min that I am looking for where the sound comes from. It feels like it comes from everywhere, it was'nt easy to locolase it. Then I realise it comes from behind my desk. The sound was horrible (a 3s loop, exacly like a alarm). 
I pull my desk and open the curtain and find the box of the truth or dare game. I open it and discover the lie detector ON. 
It is just waiting for someone to push the button. I am so f*cking scarded, thinking that a demon is waiting for me to ask him a question or to me ansering to one. 
I rush to turn this horrible thing off without trying to ask or do something and run to put it outside of my bedroom. It never intered my room again.


A summary: An old lie detector turn itself ON in his box, in a curtain that are in the wall, closed behind my desk at 3 am.




PS: I donated games to a neighbor recently and cheked this game. The batteries were exploded. They melted inside the detector. It was impossible to clean the toxic liquide that came out of the batteries. This story happend in the 2000's and the game has been made in the ~1990's so the batteries were really old. I think they exploded because of their age but just finding them like that was like a part two of this hole thing."

If your body think that you have less risks that way, than it will not ask your opinion. It has no link to your personal dessitions or plesure. 
And if you were true, don't you think that the number of rape on man will be near 0 ? When in 2015, in the US, by the NSVRC, it was ""about 1 in 14 men (7.1% or nearly 7.9 million) in the U.S."""
