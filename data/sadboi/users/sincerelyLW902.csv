A couple years ago, I had a dream where my sister accused me of molesting her daughter, and that I was lying about everything in my past. In real life, she's the one that knows the most about what happened, but in my dream she used that information against me at the police station, and for some reason was covering for my abuser.

My father said nothing, and ""secretly"" kept helping my ~~brother~~ abuser financially (he tried to hide it, but everyone already knew it), while my mother was sneaky with her apathy.

I didn't get to explain it in full though, because I didn't tell him what led to feeling like the old me was essentially dead. I didn't know how to access the happy-go-lucky kid that he knew growing up, because that kid's genuine smile faded away, along with his hopes and dreams. Happiness in general was fleeting, and I felt like an imposter that physically resembled that person that my friend knew, but that was essentially it.

I couldn't tell him about everything that happened behind closed doors, although I hinted that I was against physical abuse as punishment. A couple friends of mine shared an apartment with one of my brothers, and he informed them that we suffered physical abuse as punishment. So, my friends knew about that, but they have no idea that there were many years of sexual abuse as well. 

To him and others that I grew up with, I'm essentially one of those child stars that appeared normal and happy, and displayed talent in sports and various school subjects, but grew up as a completely miserable person (Not to be conceited or anything like that).

I feel like at a certain point all the guys (and girls) that I grew up with got the memo on how to feel comfortable with their sexuality and create intimacy, but I just never did. Some of them got the memo in middle school, more of them got it by high school, and the last few received it within a year or two after high school.

Logically, there's probably trial and error, which I've gone through. But, I've still wondered and worried about how I would react in an intimate moment, and almost tell myself that I'm not interested. 

As a young man, since I didn't have girlfriends and wasn't casually dating and hooking up with women, some of the people around me started making assumptions and hinting that I was gay. My mother was sincerely assuming that when I was in my late teens, and she is the first person that I disclosed the abuse to.

Excessive attention was such a love and hate thing, and I've wondered if it's because the attention I received at home was a strong mix of positive, neutral, and extreme negative attention. It varied so often, but the only constant was negative attention from sexual abuse right at bedtime. Eventually, all the compliments meant less and less, but it's like I didn't want to disappoint people either.

Looking back, there was a lot of stop and start behavior. Doing well for a few marking periods, but then not caring. Doing well in all classes, but one. There were many school projects that I just completely blew off, or lied about and said I ""forgot at home"". 

Throughout everything, I just thought I was lazy and uninterested with many things. Some courses were genuinely interesting, and I would try to do well.

I had trouble with playing sports because sometimes I wouldn't be aggressive or play well, and my mother, and some coaches, would yell at me the same way as my ~~brother~~ abuser.

Yeah, it's been a battle that's gotten progressively worse for me over time. Lots of confusion, anger and worry (about sexual orientation, and generally worrying if/when I was going to become a monster) starting at the beginning of the abuse cycle (around 5 years old), because it was extremely uncomfortable. As I gained more awareness of what was going on (it always was in private, couldn't tell anyone etc.), it got worse.

After about news got out (still dont know how it happened), a lack of acknowledgement (from my father) and lack of compassion (from my mother) sent me reeling, though I tried burying almost every issue about my personal life while around others in the public eye (friends and their parents, other peers, teachers and administrators, employers and coworkers, etc.). 

As I got older, it became increasingly more difficult to navigate a social world and maintain friendships, since things like dating (and marriage) and careers and goals became more standard topics of conversation that I generally tried to avoid or steer toward others. Inadequacy became a default feeling, along with shame, fear and distrust of others, some people I've known for a majority of my life.

SuicideWatch,eslen4p,t1_eskze0u,1562084322.0,"Short answer: I thought I could work through the empty feeling, but it's been unsuccessful. It's all I had after ruining most relationships and pushing people away

Long answer:

Ive been unhappy for a while. As a teenager it waseasier to mask it by talking about TV shows, movies, sports, music, and video games.

After a while weed was a masking agent. Eventually, I started feeling paranoid after smoking and analyzed every single word a person spoke, from their choice of words to their tone and body language.

I tried as hard as I could not to be a self loathing person to others, but I don't think it helped at all. I quit smoking (that was my only vice. Seldom drank) and moved away because I didn't think I had value to anyone.

Moving didn't help though. I picked up jobs and while compensation was good for paying expenses, the feeling of self hatred and a bit of paranoia (including analyzing people's words and body language) didn't completely go away. Some days would be better than others. Some weeks even too. Overall, it felt like people seemed to have real things at stake, and they can share that in a mature way. I didn't feel like anything in my life was important. 

About 6 months after moving I attempted suicide. The method I chose didn't going to work (ingesting Nyquil and melatonin to screw up my body while sleeping) and just made me extremely woozy for the next few days. Haven't told anyone about that, mainly because I don't want it to interrupt their flow of life.

I eventually got to working again. Most days felt party cloudy as opposed to what I was used to as overcast. It's been roughly two years since that point and the clouds are moving in again. It ind started last fall, and slowly more and more clouds arrived heading into the winter. 

I felt that errors at my main job were my fault, causing a shift from full time work for 3 employees to part time work. At my second job, I gave all I could to stay afloat, but morale was at an all time low. Heading into the winter I was scraping by financially and barely made it before finding another part time job.

I caused another error at my main gig, which stretched days super thin. I felt like I ruined my coworker's livelihood due to hour constraints conflicting with his health insurance. He never blamed me, but it just felt that way. 

We eventually got some hours back, but I also was searching for a new job. I eventually got an offer right after my coworker put in his two week notice. Disclosed everything with my manager and was even encouraged to accept, which I did. I also stayed and thought I could work both jobs.

At first it was fine, but problems started arising, conflicting schedules, lack of time to rest (new job was a lot of physical work) and still get things done in a timely manner.Mind you, no one was putting pressure on me. I just thought I would give my all since work was all I had. I felt like I lied to both jobs and let them down. 

Just ranting at this point, but I feel the same way leading up to my first attempt."
