In short: I didn't know until the day I got the period that I would get this (I didn't mention this beforehand bc we had sex ed starting in elementary school, but I as soon as I could think never identified as female), and my mother refused to help me. I had to force her to tell me what I had to do, how tampons work (where do I put it and how). I was scared shitless. Nevertheless I have used sanitary products as soon as I could.

Reading your experience however made me think of my very abusive childhood/life; I learned early on that my mother won't ever be here for me and that she talks shit as much as she can. Maybe this is the reason why I can't understand why someone might find this traumatizing as hell so much so they don't use sanitary products from the beginning.

I'm sure my comment came off as ""this is how I see it and I'm right"", but again, this is due to me having my unique experience + not being able to imagine someone finding it more comfortable in a puddle of blood than something more dry (even if it is traumatizing...

I still despise using that stuff because I do not identify as a woman (I'm agender) and therefore I ""shouldn't"" have periods (but I have due to my biologically female body and I'm too poor to fix that).

So it might be a stretch, and if this is the case, you should not outright go to her and ask her if she is, but rather try to find out what the real problem is.

Does it feel strange? Is she terribly ashamed of this? Did she actually have proper sex ed? My mother *refused* to tell me anything about periods and sanitary products. I had *to force her* to tell me how to use pads and tampons, because the country I live in is modern enough to expect the parents to be able to talk to their children about stuff like this, because it's normal, so they don't do it in great detail (they do tell you how the place is called where the tampon goes in, but that's it).

tattoos,fholxaw,t3_f45asl,1581763895.0,"Why is the writing crossed? What's up with the red areas? I agree though! Have you tried toasted bread, garlic and butter?? It's heaven!

ETA: English isn't my native language, so I didn't explain the toast thing, but here it goes:

Toast a slice of bread, it should be light brown or brown

Rub a piece of garlic across the toasted area

Smear a little bit of butter on the now heavenly garlic infested area

ETA: A little warning though: maybe don't start with a huge amount of garlic, because it may not be tasty. I usually use about ‚Öì-¬Ω of one small piece of garlic, approximately the size of 1¬Ω D6 with 1cm x 1cm x 1cm (and 0.5cm x 1cm x 1cm, respectively). 

Butter: 2.5cm x 2cm x 4mm.

Bread/Toast: 6cm x 6cm x 0.8mm"

I can't stand being awake and experience reality, so I tend to sleep 12-16 hours (like you lol) and am very happy with it, while others are complaining they don't have enough time and wish they didn't need to sleep at all. Once I'm more stable/less depressed I do feel like I don't have enough time."
