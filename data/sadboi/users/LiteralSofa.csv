It makes sense that you're angry at your friend; you trusted them with your past trauma and they turned right back around and mingled with your abuser while questioning your experiences and feelings. Definitely not good friend behavior. Do not let ANYONE discount your thoughts and feelings. There's no rush to start new relationships, you can take this time to really take care of yourself."

Advice,fl8x7ma,t3_fnbvy4,1584934638.0,"All the people in the comments saying ""grow up, you're an adult, just move out"" fail to realize that your mother is literally taking your money for things that aren't even important. I get the whole paying 30% but 100 dollars a week? For no reason? That's beyond the line. I recommend you sit your mother down and have a real conversation about how you are going to spend YOUR ADULT money. If she walks away, just keep sitting her down. She can't avoid you forever. If she wants you to be such an adult, then she shouldn't be surprised when you try having an adult conversation with her.
Besides, you're NINETEEN. Yes, you're technically an adult and you're working a part time job, but it's not like you're 45 mooching off of your old mother. Jesus."

Mind you, these meetings were at the back of the class, and the classroom wasn't that big, so EVERYONE could hear her say that.
Nothing at all helpful or productive. Just straight up made me feel like a fucking idiot for not excelling on tests/quizzes. Thanks, Ms. Williams."

He told me I was one of his best students, as I was the one of the only kids in his class that was passing and would do their work. I liked him as a teacher.

Two years later, he was arrested on felony charges of sleeping with a student. Allegedly, he had been having sexual relations with this 16 year old girl for 2 months. He was around 30 years old, I believe.

The girl dropped out of my school not long after that."

And strangers who don't like me? They don't matter. They're not part of my life. I never have to talk to or see them again. The same thing applies to you!
