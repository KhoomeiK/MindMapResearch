I could walk around at night pretty safely.  

School is from 7:30 - 2:15 for high school.  Other schools have similar school times but the starting time varies so the town can save money on school buses

It's kind of like the movies?  Sports are a huge deal and we have rival towns and stuff, but it's mostly just quiet and boring.

Almost no homelessness in my area (as far as I know), there's more in the cities though.
