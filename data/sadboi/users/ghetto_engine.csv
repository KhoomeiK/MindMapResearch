AeroPress,fqth6qm,t1_fqtcfu3,1589638922.0,"hello r/aeropress. i didnâ€™t expect to get many questions on this as i only tweaked the set up made by another poster on this sub. from top to bottom my set up consists of:

- ice cubes
- a knock off hario v60 from a dollar store
- a v60 filter
- aeropress cylinder 
- aeropress filter as a splash guard
- coffee grounds, 2 scoops using the aeropress scooper
- a ball jar

this is my first time doing this setup so i will be tweaking the recipe as i experiment. it was a spur of the moment thing, i had the equipment in my coffee cabinet, and was inspired by a similar post using a water bottle. i started with 6 ice cubes and added as it melted.

iâ€™ll try to be more scientific in my approach the next time i make cold brew and let you guys know.


great sub btw."
