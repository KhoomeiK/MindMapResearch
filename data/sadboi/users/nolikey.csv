breakingmom,f9lykos,t3_e5hmxl,1575435583.0,"Get it girl. I can relate- I caught myself slipping down that path when my depression was at its worst. I live in Orange County CA, where the housewives are blonde, extremely instagrammy, drive big SUV’s and hardly ever mutter a curse word. When I decided to “own” who I was, I stopped liking me and started LOVING me. So did my kids! Of course I get my kids to school on time everyday with their nut-free lunches and attend PTA meetings, but I’m the neon-redhead with a septum ring, new tattoos and I’m blasting Metallica on my way to my grocery run 😂☠️

Have fun being you!"
