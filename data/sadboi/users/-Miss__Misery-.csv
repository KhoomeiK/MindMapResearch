SebDerm,fo1e4eb,t3_g4v6gm,1587431313.0,"As I said in another comment, one must be quite ignorant to believe that a completely incurable chronic condition is “not that bad.” 

There is not a single way to completely CURE this ailment, only ways in which to ATTEMPT to manage its symptoms for periods of time, until it WILL eventually return; No ifs, ands or buts about that one. As we all know, It may go away for a while, it may decrease in severity a bit, etc, but we will have this shit for life. 

What is OP smoking? I get that everyone has different experiences and responses to feelings and events, but still, have some compassion. This is a terrible skin issue that is very emotionally taxing, annihilates self confidence, causes a lot of physical pain, itching, bleeding, dry/weepy sores, costs time, money and trial & error to manage, etc. 

For me personally, having SD also exacerbates an already existing mental condition called compulsive skin picking. I simply cannot handle having any uneven spots anywhere on my skin, obviously including my scalp, and that leaves me with so many sores and raw and irritated areas (which is the entirety of my head currently). This dumbass condition makes managing my mental health so much fucking harder. Sorry to anyone that actually read my rant, but my head is a mess and this really made me aggravated."
SebDerm,fo1cjpa,t1_fo006jy,1587430343.0,"Ok thank you. I was hoping others would agree and wouldn’t tell me to shut up and that I’m the one overreacting. 

But to make a post that’s all about you primarily, and that’s supposedly just a note for future readers to find, about how it “isn’t that bad” while were talking about a completely incurable, chronic issue???? That makes no sense whatsoever. You literally cannot even treat this shit, only ATTEMPT to manage it, but it’s supposedly not that bad. I fucking wish it wasn’t that bad, aha. 

I guess I could try to see the point made here, but still, it doesn’t make this any less nonsensical. Like if you have something to actually contribute on the subject in any given subreddit, then by all means..."

The entire surface of my head is crusted over and it doesn’t end... there are LAYERS UPON LAYERS UPON LAYERS. 

I have extremely severe pain when I touch my hair or when it is moved at all right now. It is completely excruciating and I am not overreacting. I have tried many things and yes I am new here so I’m hoping that a few different things will eventually provide me some relief. If this doesn’t subside asap I’m going to have to try and figure out a way to get into a derm sooner. This shit is completely unmanageable and excruciatingly painful in every way.

curlyhair,fl34lck,t3_f4huno,1584768628.0,"I came across this post while searching the sub and I just wanted to say it sounds like our hair is very similar. 

(From the root to the middle of the back of my head, I have a bit of 2a type; at the root it is very flat, thin & has minimal wave. For the bulk of my hair with texture to it, I have primarily loose 2b waves, with a few straggler 2c curly ringlets along the ends. My overall length is just past the middle of my bust).  

But yeah.... My top layer gets SO FLAT. Always has.. My hair so desperately needs a cut, and I’ve never once gotten one that I liked and didn’t require touchups when I got home. So.. Planning on getting a devacut in the next couple weeks.

Another thing holding me (and my hair) back is the fact that, even just 1-3x a week depending on severity, I am currently relying on a very strong, stripping, medicated shampoo for severe seborrheic dermatitis. Mine is so fkn bad that you can actually see it in my hairline and sideburn hair area, and obv in big patches covering the vast majority of my scalp. :(   It presents as big flaky white/yellow patches, w/ bloody and scabbed scalp everywhere. Ugh

I’m in the process of choosing and ordering a sulfate-free shampoo to replace my harsh T/gel; While searching here, I heard a lot of curlies that also have seb. derm. say they like the As I Am scalp line."

Four months of continuous time is the most I’ve had in the last 10+ years of active addiction. I’m in a better place than I’ve ever been in in my entire life. I feel so blessed to have made it this far. 

I am shocked to have done so, considering the fact that before I went into treatment, my mental state was at its absolute worst. For reference, I have Bipolar 1 Disorder. Anyway... yeah. My life was an absolute. fucking. train wreck. During the final several months of my last run, I was homeless. I was overdosing multiple times a week. One of my close friends was an accomplished, retired marine medic/current EMT, and even he was just barely able to save me one time with IV Narcan; I was falling out once again when it wore off. I had been in 4 different car accidents in which I was at fault in less than a fucking year; I legitimately almost killed myself in one of them, when I nodded out and my car hit a tree head on.. the impact was so severe, that my engine dropped out of my car. 


When I showed up for yet another round of inpatient treatment that I selfishly begged my mom to pay for in attempt to relieve my suffering, I was in psychosis, suicidal, anorexic/malnourished/starving, and overall just miserable... 

I mentioned above that I have been diagnosed with Bipolar 1, a mental health condition that close to 75% of people diagnosed with ALSO struggle with substance abuse. That is such a terrifying statistic/number to me, but in a weird way it does make me feel validated to a small degree... it makes me feel a little bit less crazy, and a little more understood. 


Today, I feel more stable than I have in years. Unfortunately, I knew that a huge part of (hopefully) being able to accomplish this, for me personally, was taking a huge leap of faith and gathering the courage to move to the other side of the country, away from everyone and everything I’ve ever known. A big part of this was willingly leaving behind every single person, place and thing that I knew damn well I would not *ever* be able to stay clean with such easy access to. Not just that, but also just the inability to simply avoid those triggering, everyday simple things. I can’t even drive down most roads in my hometown without fiending. I’ve shot or snorted something in every fast food restaurants bathroom within 40 miles of my house, for fucks sake. I just... I knew I had to go. 

I knew I had to leave my family and my friends to go and build a new life. I don’t think the progress I’ve made would have been anywhere near as easy as it has been had I not made that decision. And it’s worth noting that I did go on another run here, just before getting clean, when my original housing situation did not work out. So it’s not that I can’t find dope if I wanted it. I could in a second... but I just don’t need to live that way anymore. 

Now, I have never in my life had a better relationship with my mother. I feel more at ease in my own skin and my own mind than I have in years and years. I am working a full-time job in an infant room at a prestigious, private school in my new home state of CO. I am so thrilled with all the blessings early recovery has given me, and I can’t wait to see what’s to come. I’m really doing it this time, fam."
