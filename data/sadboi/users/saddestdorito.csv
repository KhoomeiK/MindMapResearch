sex,fpz40hj,t3_g6d5ia,1589013300.0,"I searched up this topic on reddit because I have been feeling really odd about my high sex drive. Obviously this libido gets even higher when I’m in a relationship. I get through the day by thinking about sex with my SO. It feels unhealthy? I told him from the beginning that I have a high sex drive and it’s disgusting to me. He always reassures me that it’s hot and he actually enjoys it, but this comes to my detriment because one time he actually admitted he can’t keep up with me. It makes sense; after his last couple of relationships he never got into hook up culture, whereas I fully indulged in that after my last relationships. I’m glad I’ve found a thread where many women agree on this topic; I feel too needy voicing my desires. Got a vibrator during quarantine so this seems to suffice for now."
BPD,fpckoun,t3_gcafyy,1588504151.0,"Thank you for sharing this thorough advice. I admire your ability to take a step back and assess your own actions. I want to make sure my relationship lasts by pulling myself out of a destructive cycle where it looks as though I’m victimizing myself. I come to this reddit a lot to vent, and ultimately to learn, and your contribution makes me more mindful of what I need to change and adjust."
BPD,fp8utsc,t3_gc20j0,1588403737.0,This is exactly what’s been going on with me and I really don’t know why.
BPD,foxh7ls,t3_g9yplt,1588143898.0,"I (F21) have these exact swings. You’ve described my relationship behavior so accurately I almost feel like I wrote this post myself. Especially during quarantine I have been feeling worse about the abandonment anxiety and have been more sensitive to slow replies and such. Because I’m still dealing with these dramatic swings I don’t have much advice to give, but I’m here to let you know that your shifting perspectives about yourself in terms of the relationship are very valid. I hope you will be able to find a healthy balance between your swings, and reading a lot of the posts on this subreddit—and particularly your post rn—have helped me a lot. It’s nice to know that people cannot only describe but can empathize and relate about these things."
BPD,foxgicz,t3_ga2dv4,1588143288.0,"I’m in the same boat. I have pretty much convinced myself that one day he’s going to leave me for someone better, and I feel like that day can happen anytime now. If I see any indication of it I start breaking down. However, the advice given above is very reassuring...I hope you will be able to work through these thoughts, it is hard reminding yourself that you can be loved even if your view on love is distorted and skewed by anxieties. As the person above said, analyze the proof (which is what I’m trying so hard to do, since I’m constantly operating on assumptions). Somewhere within the proof you’ll realize your SO does really love you."
BPD,foi04oh,t3_g7k8hk,1587776024.0,"Hi, thank you for sharing—I resonate with your title strongly (which is why I clicked on this post) as well as your story. I (21F) am also having horrible flashbacks everyday. I constantly think about what I’ve done wrong. Even in the daily activities I’m trying to normally carry out, once I’m not occupied I often recall the relationships I messed up due to my own toxicity, and let myself feel the regret. This has been most of my quarantine and has especially felt worse today. 

I’m also raised in an asian household, my father also definitely has undiagnosed BPD and experiencing his intense and near violent mood swings wasn’t a great influence. So I understand where you are coming from on that as well. 

But, I too have a wonderful SO who has watched me break down but still loves and cares and understands me. When you have people like that in your life, it is clear that it is not BPD that defines you and that you are deserving of love. It’s so hard to reinforce that thought, especially when the flashbacks make you feel like shit, but I do genuinely believe that your acknowledgement and honesty in this post will help you make steps towards accepting yourself, and not feeling like you want to flee. 

It’s all easier said than done though, given that just last night I had my own outburst and the agitation carried over into today, and I feel like I need to run away from my own toxic self. Reading your post helped me a lot though, so thank you."
Mononucleosis,fmxq0hf,t1_fmwyvka,1586469645.0,"Hey, I’m recovering and I got tested. I got positive for mono. But my partner is showing zero signs of being sick, but then again he’s a healthy person. I also haven’t seen him in about 3-4 weeks. My whole family did not get sick by the way either, and I’ve been quarantined with them. I know it takes a long time for mono to actually show up, but it seems like everyone around me is doing okay. I think the best medicine right now is to not worry :) it’s likely that most people are immune already. I’m not a doctor but this is just based on my own experience and stuff I’ve learned on the internet in the past month."
BPD,fk1r6ua,t1_fk1kmdt,1583785228.0,"I think my mania used to be characterized by overworking myself, increased creativity and socialization for sure, spending a fuck ton of money and sleeping less. I always kind of felt like I was like...hydroplaning on the plane of reality. It felt unstable but I was sure moving fast. 
I also have the same sort of work habit. At work last year I started so many wonderful projects and could never finish them. This caused me to get in trouble with my supervisor. I had no idea what was going on with me but I was like, how am I so lazy? How is it possible to be this lazy? But now I realize there’s a difference between laziness and depression. I can feel that difference now. 
I don’t know how to trust myself either. It’s really hard to say. But I’ve been able to track nuances in feeling after my diagnosis, and have realized why some things in the past happened, for example, my grades dropped from 2.2 one quarter and 4.0 the next. 
Also, idk why but I’ve never had bad acne until I started the high dosage of lamictal. It stopped now though."
BPD,fk1gkia,t3_ffyd1l,1583779240.0,"I was prescribed lamictal In June shortly after I was diagnosed with both BPD and bipolar type 2 (I’m also on Zoloft 25mg). They gradually adjusted my dosage so it didn’t reach 250mg until last month. I started noticing a difference in October when I was on 200mg (which I think is the normal dose but don’t quote me on that). My manic episodes still occur but not to the severity that they were before. I just mostly feel really motivated and energized and confident now, instead of feeling very hyper, unstable and spending a LOT of money (overdrawing constantly). 

In terms of the BPD I’m not sure if it’s helped to be honest. Relationships are usually the trigger for me personally, and getting involved in a relationship cannot be cured by any sort of medicine. My psych has told me that BPD is most effectively treated through DBT. 

But yeah, lamictal for me was a life saver. My depressive episodes in particular really destroyed my academics and work performance. I’ve been able to notice that both episodes are easier to work through and feel normal. I hope this helps."
BPD,fjzl41a,t3_ffd320,1583722301.0,"I deal with the same thing, it's literally a go-to coping mechanism. I pretty much play scenarios in my head everyday, and it involves my SO's ex. It's almost like a drug. Usually it ends with me assaulting the person, humiliating them and asserting that I am better, OR apologizing to them and explaining to them that I'm so messed up and I'm sorry for taking the person she loved. Sometimes these scenarios last for like 5-10 minutes. When I'm manic the tendency to fantasize gets worse and more prolonged. I really can't believe I'm admitting this, especially because I would never do this sort of thing to her, ever. 

Since it's a fantasy/imagined experience, it's easy to indulge in it and get carried away. I was actually going to post the same thing a couple of days ago, but as some people in this thread have mentioned good ways to thwart this behavior. I'm relieved to know other people do this. I really thought it was a tendency that was unique to me, and it scares me a lot. But it makes sense because I am triggered very easily and often times have a hard time swallowing my anger and pride."
BPD,fjzkbce,t1_fjzeycj,1583721747.0,"Yes, I think it is safe to assume that my work does give them sort of satisfaction--likely benevolent. I'm just scared because they know where I go to school/know who my friends are/know what I look like. I guess that's on me for sharing my life too publicly. When this stuff freaks me out, I often wish I could just remove my online presence forever. I was very close to deleting all of my accounts. But I don't think that's necessary and I don't want to lose the friendships and business interactions I've developed. Nonetheless, I think it helps to hear it from someone who courses through life with BPD, so thank you again. 

\[ In terms of the art: thank you. I started posting nervously about six? years ago. But it changed my life to share my art. It has helped me cope when I didn't realize I was struggling for so many years. So with that being said: definitely share your work! You never know what could happen if you just share it. :)  hopefully this post inspires you to do so. \]"
BPD,fjzdtfi,t1_fjzcmqj,1583717383.0,"Hi, thank you for the reply, it actually means a lot and alleviates stress to hear a more objective perspective. I think you're right that I should just stop giving them sort of reaction. I've never received any weird comments besides said person admitting they had a crush on me, but I guess that goes back to the idolization point you mentioned. But thank you so much! It's given me great opportunity and I love to share my work and so many people are supportive. This is the only downside and with my anxiety/BPD it's really hard to navigate this feeling of being watched or taken away from my life that I've worked so hard to stabilize in the past year after my diagnoses."
BPD,fjg4yvg,t3_fcqjpm,1583311700.0,"Hi, I’m really thankful you posted this. I made a Reddit solely to join this community and use it as a form of group therapy as im too busy to find a therapist right now. I felt really fucked up until reading multiple posts like this. I always feel compelled to reply because it’s a relief that people struggle with this and it’s almost debilitating to me.
From experience, i almost ruined a wonderful relationship about a month ago. I’ve cried about it way too much, told my partner too much, and it doesn’t necessarily annoy him but he did say “you make me think about it more than I even want to.” Whenever we do sexual things my motivation is not only to please him but do better than his ex ever did.
It would be nice to bring this up to your partner if possible, but please don’t be like me and cry about it frequently. It’s not worth it."
BPD,fjg47zv,t3_fd90dx,1583310735.0,"I’ve posted about something similar before. Our situations may not be the exact same (although we are the same age), but I relate to you fully on the obsession. It’s been hard for me but everyday, little by little, I get over it. What I’m realizing is that it all comes down to trust—which is really hard to give to someone when you’re constantly fearing abandonment, and when his ex is somewhat in the picture still. 

A year ago, My ex left me after two years and quintessentially cheated on me because three days later he began dating someone else. Everyday I still think about this and how it’s caused extreme trust issues, but I’ve learned I guess that is the price of love. Even people who don’t have BPD must take the risk of trusting someone with the potential to get their heart destroyed; I know it’s easier for them because they probably don’t unhealthily fixate on their SO’s exes. 

And I can’t lie to you. I still look at her account at least once a week. I am deathly scared of seeing her. I think about it every time I leave the house. The last time I saw her I lost control of myself. But everyday, I am working so hard to actively fight my mind and trust in my SO’s actions, and his complete support of my BPD. To have someone love you despite your diagnosis feels good. 

An ex is an ex. The significant other you have in the present loves you, and seems supportive of your BPD. 

I hope maybe this helps as a form of support. :)"
BPD,fhcech6,t3_f2czj1,1581461514.0,"I did this last week; don’t hurt yourself. Mental health comes first of course. I don’t know how lenient the course is but I emailed my professor telling them I had urgent health issues that needed to be addressed. I said I can give a doctors note if needed. If they had asked for a doctors note I would have asked my psychiatrist to write something up explaining my condition.
Regardless, it seems that you care enough about your academics to feel this way, so even if you don’t get the points you need, just know that it isn’t the end of your world or life. In a couple years, even in a couple of months, you won’t feel this regret and it won’t affect your mental health in the long run!"
BPD,fhcdl36,t3_f2bwc7,1581461142.0,"I don’t drink necessarily but I react with cutting or smoking. Either way it’s a strong reaction. But since I’m on campus mostly all the time, I can’t do much, so I viscerally start feeling so anxious and pained to the point where I’m on the verge of fainting; I’m debilitated and can no longer focus in the lecture. But if I’m at home I resort to self harm or smoking weed. 
I need constant reassurance, but i have to understand he’s busy and occupied with depressing things himself. Yet I don’t understand why I’m able to reply to him instantly when I have so much going on too? I don’t know."
BPD,fh7axno,t1_fh26yce,1581322484.0,"Thank you. Don’t worry, I’m not too sensitive when it comes to this stuff. Your insight helps so thank you for leaving a comment."
BPD,fh7avgv,t3_f1dtwb,1581322403.0,"I made this account a couple of days ago searching for peace with my BPD which seems to be getting worse. This was exactly what I needed to read. It was so beautifully written and I’m crying as I write this, as some sort of catharsis, because I know as long as I keep pushing through this I’ll be okay. I have done things I regret, like you, and I’m trying so hard not to repeat these mistakes. So thank you for putting it all in perspective for me. It means a lot to me and others in this community."
BPD,fgyz7n1,t1_fgvhr1c,1581188951.0,"I’ve only been in two year relationships so I can’t even the emotional investments that 2+ year relationships can do. I’m also mutually acquainted with my SO’s ex, and whenever she posts on Facebook I get so angry. A couple weeks ago she actually entered me SO’s apartment (she had to use the bathroom because SO’s roommate was having a party at their community barbecue area). I was so angry I sprinted out of the house and self harmed. My SO told me she apologized for coming in. I was so mad that she tried to get a word in with him. I can’t imagine having to confront your mutual friend, but I think you’re very strong for keeping it together and not lashing out at her. 

Obviously I’m not a therapist and I empathize with you so hard, especially because this issue seems to be ruining my mental health and can potentially tear my relationship apart. But what you said about “there is no love there anymore” is very true. 
There’s an amount of trust that you have to give to your SO (which I’m trying so hard to do), and in that trust is knowing that your SO loves you now, and they’ve invested a lot of time into you too. Of course this shit sounds cliche but this is the only way I can kind of save myself from this obsession. Or by going on reddit and finding peace because I’m relieved to know others go through the same self inflicted torment."
BPD,fgyxq08,t1_fgvakoc,1581188451.0,"I do the same. I finally realized I need to get help when I kept bringing her up, and he said “you know what? It really fucking hurts when you remind me of her.” I realized he never even thinks of her. I’m the one who is keeping her alive in my head, and me constantly mentioning her only tears us apart. 
I’m trying to alleviate this obsession by going on reddit and reading other similar experiences, so I thank you for sharing. I also cried twice while I was giving him head because I wondered who did better—me or his ex. Same with sex. I wonder who’s better in bed and then I can’t get off anymore. 
I think we can find peace knowing that ultimately, in the present, our SO chose to be with us."
BPD,fgi9syv,t3_eynv7x,1580813123.0,"This is exactly how I feel, literally exactly. I’ve been wanting to be put on hold ever since I self harmed pretty badly last Friday, but I don’t necessarily want to kill myself, I just need a break from the intensity of my emotions. Reading your train of thought makes me realize I’m not alone in feeling this way. I get mad at myself for feeling exhausted and for giving up on myself...but sometimes that’s ok. I hope you find reasons to work through this horrible feeling, I’ve been obsessed about it for a couple of days now."
