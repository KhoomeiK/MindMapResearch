Don‚Äôt smoke weed beforehand. If you know she hasn‚Äôt done much drugs before, 50 ug will probably be okay and I think she will be comfortable since you said you guys will also have a trip sitter. You seem like a really nice person and I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre looking out for her. Hope you both have a wonderful trip! Don‚Äôt forget drinks and snacks!"

It‚Äôs the same substance, ecstasy; e is ecstasy, molly is the ‚Äúpure‚Äù rock form of ecstasy and presses are like the red supremes you had yesterday. If you rolled, I would wait at least 3 weeks before rolling again. Preferably 3 months. You will most likely feel it still even if you do it today since you haven‚Äôt rolled before except yesterday.

Me and my friends went to the parking lot, we smoked a few bowls and I was drinking my energy drink then I felt like I needed to lay down so I did. I guess I was a bit anxious because I kept having these thoughts that these 2 friends of mine didn‚Äôt want to be there and didn‚Äôt want to be my friend anymore? I know that‚Äôs a weird thought but if I‚Äôm being honest, that‚Äôs how I felt and I felt immense pressure. Next thing I knew, I felt this aching in my head, my heart started racing, I just couldn‚Äôt concentrate on anything and I was holding my head for a solid 15 minutes or something (felt like an eternity to me like the world was ending) while my friends were asking me if I was okay and if I could respond since I was turning bright red from everything and it didn‚Äôt look like I was breathing.
