Just make sure to adjust your price on depop accordingly to include shipping. And flat envelopes are completely fine for shipping, just be careful for small metal earrings because depending on your luck, they could bend during delivery. Totally recommend small padded packagings from amazon, they can be about €15-20 a piece when bought in a pack of 20-30."
LSD,fnng2xw,t1_fnnfm2j,1587091555.0,"Actually sorry, let me scratch that first comment. When I took LSD for the first time, I didn’t have a trip sitter because everyone was tripping and I smoked a joint beforehand with them even though it was my first time. My advice? Don’t smoke weed beforehand. If you know she hasn’t done much drugs before, 50 ug will probably be okay and I think she will be comfortable since you said you guys will also have a trip sitter. You seem like a really nice person and I’m glad you’re looking out for her. Hope you both have a wonderful trip! Don’t forget drinks and snacks!"

It’s the same substance, ecstasy; e is ecstasy, molly is the “pure” rock form of ecstasy and presses are like the red supremes you had yesterday. If you rolled, I would wait at least 3 weeks before rolling again. Preferably 3 months. You will most likely feel it still even if you do it today since you haven’t rolled before except yesterday. But just beware that if you keep it up, the more you do it, the less you’ll feel it eventually."

Drugs,fn4ks8l,t3_fzk98n,1586643408.0,"I don’t think it’s really a matter of if it’s okay or not because it just happens to some people. It’s called rolling for a reason when you take ecstasy because I think most people can’t help it, it just happens. I’m not sure if it’s healthy or unhealthy but if you’re gonna take ecstasy, I would just say to expect your eyes to look like they’re rolling back if you’re looking at any bright lights."

Me and my friends went to the parking lot, we smoked a few bowls and I was drinking my energy drink then I felt like I needed to lay down so I did. I guess I was a bit anxious because I kept having these thoughts that these 2 friends of mine didn’t want to be there and didn’t want to be my friend anymore? I know that’s a weird thought but if I’m being honest, that’s how I felt and I felt immense pressure. Next thing I knew, I felt this aching in my head, my heart started racing, I just couldn’t concentrate on anything and I was holding my head for a solid 15 minutes or something (felt like an eternity to me like the world was ending) while my friends were asking me if I was okay and if I could respond since I was turning bright red from everything and it didn’t look like I was breathing. Decided to see a therapist after and found out I had an anxiety/panic attack. For months after the incident, I was scared I was going to have another one.

At first I thought he was being respectful and he kind of was but eventually, I found him talking to this guy that was sending him nsfw content to try to get him to buy it which he obviously wasn’t going to but it made me mad that he kept in contact with him even if it was things like “how was your day?” If my significant other is having intimate conversations and personally messaging someone who sends them content (even if my significant other doesn’t send something back), not just following publicly posted content, then I feel like they have crossed a line for me, especially if we haven’t discussed this beforehand and they aren’t respectful with my own insecurities.
