Please understand that a whole new world will open up to you when you move out on your own and get involved with things that you find interest in and people who share those interests. You aren’t confined to friendships in high school or home and I am confident that you will acquire family with no blood relation. 

Anyway, thank God for the internet and social platforms because we are exposed to the reality and truth that not everyone acts like narcissistic assholes. We care about you without even knowing you. 

You deserve the happiest of birthdays, I wish you many fulfilling and beautiful years of happiness going forward ❤️ 

Much love fam"

IM GONNA GO AHEAD AND SAY THIS FOR THOSE IN THE BACK....

THESE TEACHERS ARE PRED👏🏼AT👏🏼ORS👏🏼.  

I said PREDATORS! Same as that nasty hairy overweight man praying on little girls in the neighborhood. Or Jeffery Epstein’s clients.

Only difference....they have access to all these children in the school system. As long as we keep treating this like it’s different, as long as we give the pass to these young semi- attractive women, there will continue to be abuse cases like this in the SCHOOLS.

He mistook my reaction to something he said and didn’t listen when I tried to tell him that it wasn’t what he was reading. He blew up on me and then completely cut me off and it was over literally nothing.

BreakUps,eubt0kd,t1_eua1evw,1563656288.0,"cherryblossomkiss, I’m not sure why you are even commenting on this post. It’s really sad that you feel the need to tear someone down because you don’t agree with them. If you can’t give productive and helpful advice instead of shaming people for their choices, you should just stfu and keep it to yourself. 

That being said, to the OP, it would probably be more beneficial if you were to cut your losses and not be vengeful or spiteful because of what he’s done to you. Yes, he hurt you but if you consume yourself with trying to get back at him, it will most likely blow up in your face. I’ve learned with experience that doing nasty things for revenge causes me to suffer twice as much as the person I’m getting back at. Please try and just let it go.

You’ve gotta try to get away because it will most likely effect every relationship you ever have. The longer you put yourself through it, the longer it takes to heal from it.

I was abused growing up so mostly I never talked about what was going on with ANYONE, which kept me from building lasting relationships. After high school I was victimized by a violent kidnapping and attempted murder crime that included sexual assault...this caused a great amount of distrust in people. 5 years later, I ended up in an abusive relationship that lasted a few years. He stripped me of all of my dignity, self-worth, and self-confidence and then shattered my ankle and took everything from me (I.e. stole over $12,000, took my pets, my home, my livelihood, and my ability to walk). I’ve been on this difficult road to recovery for about a year now and can’t seem to bounce back. 

I LITERALLY freeze when I’m around people and act very awkward. It is causing a great deal of depression too because I know how I used to be.

Thank you for posting, it helps to know we aren’t alone."

I think you’re gonna be fine! 

And it’s kinda cute that you’re nervous!"

JUSTNOFAMILY,eofih0e,t1_eoeoj9k,1558535309.0,"Okay so in context I’ve tried to introduce every long term boyfriend I’ve ever had = 3 and she just makes excuse after excuse. My current boyfriend introduced me to his family and we go do lots of things with them. It came up recently in a small argument that “you haven’t even introduced me to your family” . Its embarrassing, I feel ashamed, I feel less than worthy, and I feel like I can’t offer what most people want, which is to be accepted into your SOs family. 

She seems to just push everyone out. My nephews dad has been rejected by her (my sisters so) and my other niece and nephew’s mother has been rejected (my brothers so) as well. It’s not a big deal to my brother because he lives half way across the country. 

I’m really hurt by it tbh."
