When you're experiencing localized pain somewhere in your body, it can give you temporary relief to inflict another source of pain in that same area.  The pain receptors are ""reset"" in a way, and for a moment the sensory input that your brain is receiving is correlated with the lesser pain rather than the more intense pain. For example, yesterday I smashed my thigh into the corner of a table and the first thing I did was slap it and apply some light pressure.  It immediately brought relief.  You obviously don't want to worsen the injury, so there's a sweet spot to find.  Rubbing a tissue injury has the same effect.

Yes, it would most definitely matter equally and identically to the copy, in the same way that it would matter to both you and me if we were together in a room and someone came in with a gun and said that they were going to kill one of us.  Each person - the original person and the clone person - does not want to die.  They also probably don't want each other to die because most people are opposed to murder (and they likely share some kind of special affection for each other, given that they're identical clones).  That's why I said that if they're psychopaths then they would have absolutely no reason to care if the other one dies and they survive, as the death of the other one is simply the death of another person, so it doesn't affect their own personal experience.

>So the difference in individuals doesn’t matter to anyone but them.

I would disagree with that.  If your loved one was copied and you could choose to kill either the original or the copy, would you not care which one you killed?  Yes, both beings are identical, but one of them is the one that you know and love while the other is just a copy that *feels* like the one that you know and love because it has your loved one's memories.  You could pick either one and you wouldn't be able to tell the difference and neither would it, but one of them is the conscious entity that you know and the other is just the copy of it.

I feel like maybe you just don't understand what I'm saying.  All I'm saying is that there is no magical connection between the original and the clone.  They are not the same person, there is no plural I involved; they are two identical copies of the same person and two identical instances of the same consciousness.  If you got copied tomorrow and then I killed you, you would be dead.  That would be the end of you.  You would fade to black and you would never have experiences again.

For all intents and purposes, we have two instances of the same consciousness until they start occupying different physical space and processing different external stimuli, but again, one is the original and one is not.

I'm saying that *your* consciousness would not leave your body and enter the clone's body; instead, a second instance of your consciousness would be created.  *That* conscious entity would have the experience of being you, whether their consciousness was interrupted by hundreds of years of death or if the transition was completely seamless due to some kind of advanced technology, because it would possess all of your memories.  It would have the experience of being you in the same way that you have the experience of being you right now.  In that way, it is *you*, just a second you.

Again though, the ""original"" you is still experiencing yourself as you always have.  You won't share conscious experiences with your clone (you won't feel what it feels, you won't know what it knows - that is, the things it knows that it learned after the separation), in the same way that you don't share conscious experiences with any other person.

neurophilosophy,fqg88a9,t3_giiq4f,1589340092.0,"I'm confused about what you're asking here.  At first I thought you were talking about a ""philosophical clone"" situation (I just made that up, sorry) where for the sake of a thought experiment a perfect copy of somebody is made so that the copy possesses all of the memories that the original person had.  But then you started talking about twins and it seems as though you're talking about a literal clone, as in they grow an embryo in a petri dish using your genetic material and eventually a baby is born that is functionally your identical twin.  In that latter case, no, there's nothing different about that situation than any other pair of identical twins.  That baby is born and it has its own experiences and life, it never thinks that its you and you never think that you're it."

neurophilosophy,fqg7p0b,t1_fqf7y13,1589339754.0,"OP's question is often misunderstood, I think.  People conflate ""the clone feels just like you"" with ""you *are* the clone.""  Let me try to explain it as best as I can.

Let's set it up this way: an identical copy of you is made, right down to the (insert smallest subatomic particle here).  It therefore has all of your memories as if they were its own, and it's identical to you in every way.

Yes, this ""clone"" would come into existence having had the same experiences as you, since it possesses all of your memories up until the moment you were copied.  It is, quite simply, a second ""instance"" of your consciousness.  However, the clone doesn't experience itself as a second instance or a copy because it feels literally just like you do; it's been there living its (your) life the whole time.  Hell, it even remembers signing up for that cool experiment where you got paid $1,000,000 to have your body copied.  ""It worked,"" the clone thinks.  It's amazed that its (your) consciousness was seamlessly transferred into a new body without even a brief interruption of consciousness, let alone anything resembling a short nap even.

You, however, don't have this same experience.  When your clone was made, you just kept right on experiencing the world in the same way that you always had.  There was no interruption of consciousness (in the same way that there wasn't for your clone), except *your* instance of consciousness truly was never uninterrupted, whereas theirs just *feels* like it was uninterrupted due to having your memories.

So no, you don't feel what the clone feels, you don't share its thoughts, and when you're dead you don't continue to live on in your clone's body.  It still lives on and again, it feels as though its just had one long uninterrupted life, but since the divergence happened, you share no more conscious experiences with your clone than you do with any other person in the world who isn't you. If you’re a psychopath with no empathy for others, then you shouldn’t care at all if your clone is killed. It’s just another person, as far as you’re concerned.

Another way to look at this: if sometime in the future long after your death somehow is able to make an exact copy of your body and brain as it was just before your death, then that copy would come into existence feeling just like you.  It wouldn't be *you*, however, it would be a new instance of you.  You would have faded to black long before and that was the end of your story.  In order for there to be some kind of continued experience between two instances of consciousness we need to invoke magic."

I would say that the protagonists are Ned Stark, Daenerys, Jon Snow, Arya, Sansa, Bran, Tyrion, and Jamie. Next tier would be Brienne, the Hound, Rob, Theon, and Sam. The other central characters on the show are either antagonists (Cersei, Littlefinger, etc.) or side characters of varying importance."

answers,fqcosd1,t1_fqc2xqj,1589264153.0,"Someone has misled you about farts. 

The smell of our farts varies significantly based on a whole collection of things that aren’t reason for concern, minor variations in diet being chief amongst them. There just isn’t a sufficiently direct link between how our farts smell and our health for that capacity to have been selected for in an evolutionary sense. 

In addition, there would be too much higher order reasoning involved for it to be selected for in the first place. In other words, an organism would need to be able to not only detect that their farts smell unpleasant to them (thereby indicating an aberration in the state of their gastrointestinal system which is potentially cause for concern), *and* be capable of thinking “my farts smell bad, I need to change my dietary habits.” I’m sure you can’t imagine a non-verbal ape (or an even less advanced ancestor of ours) being able to reason in that way, and this capacity would have evolved in one of those earlier stages of our evolutionary history, so it just couldn’t have come about. Eating is very important, so evolution ensured that our drive to eat (or not eat) particular foods is largely instinctual and devoid of the need for much thinking (we only needed to start actually *thinking* about our diets when agriculture arose).

I don’t know shit about farts, so that’s all based on my knowledge of evolution and psychology. Your mileage may vary."
