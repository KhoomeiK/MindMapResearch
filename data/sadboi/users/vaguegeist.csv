conspiracytheories,fqwthqt,t3_glbgix,1589717083.0,"This is exactly why I hate when people get so invested in the left or right dichotomy of politics. It’s the entire system that’s corrupt. People are too distracted to care. And people are such know-it-alls when it comes to “their side” of the red vs. blue (them vs. us) mentality. My only wish is for the masses to take a step back and see the whole picture, the reality. Illusion of choice. We have more power in numbers, but they are getting exactly what they want out of us, divide and conquer. If everyone hates their fellow neighbors, how could they possibly have the energy to come together to fight against the true enemy?"

Skincare_Addiction,feevayo,t1_fee5lxn,1579041984.0,Anything you recommend in particular?
Skincare_Addiction,fec0ybe,t3_eodtbi,1578965029.0,"Products shown: Sephora AMA Clean Skin Gel, St. Ives Gentle Smoothing Oatmeal Scrub & Mask, e.l.f. Hydrating Primer Mist, CeraVe Hydrating Hyaluronic Acid Serum, Clinique iD dramatically different hydrating jelly with uneven textured skin insert, and Clinique moisture surge 72-hour auto-replenishing hydrator.

Based on how my skin looks and feels for the day, I’ll use either the Sephora AMA or the St. Ives to prep my skin. If it’s really dry I go for the St. Ives to remove flakes.

I use the e.l.f mist after I wash my face, after applying makeup, or throughout the day to add more moisture.

I use the CeraVe before my moisturizers. I usually apply the Clinique moisture surge first, then add the Clinique iD to lock it in. I also use the Clinique moisture surge if I notice my skin drying out throughout the day or at the end of the day. Sometimes I add the Clinique iD again if my skin is still super dry after applying the moisture surge.

I’ve been working so hard, researching and checking out this sub for tips and good products to use for my skin. Seems to be paying off! Hope this helps someone else out there!"

AskReddit,f12yx54,t3_d7eyy3,1569149437.0,"I enjoy socializing with people... but not all the time and especially not with people I don’t connect with. I don’t like meaningless conversations, I like depth. 

I’m the kind of person who doesn’t hang out in the break room at work. I take the extra couple of minutes to walk to my car for my breaks. I enjoy the momentary solitude and silence to reflect and not feel overstimulated. 

I’m used to doing activities that only involve me and thinking, that gives me the most pleasure. I’ve been like that since I was a child. 

I’ve been in a room full of people who I could talk to yet felt like a ghost, an intruder, a fraud. I can socialize well, sometimes I go out, but i don’t always enjoy socializing, sometimes going out feels like more trouble than it’s worth. Homebodies unite."

relationship_advice,etyfrqa,t3_ce47v6,1563317408.0,"You guys started dating at 15/16 years old. People change A LOT from that age up until your 20s. Once you’re in your 20s, you’re fully developed and pretty much are who you’re gonna be until you get old. If she’s an alcoholic like you say, she could’ve been lying to you for some time. I don’t believe this “out of the blue” thing. That’s just my take, I’ve had my fair share of toxic relationships. Just break up. She’s over you dude, it’s clear as day. 

People always say they’ve been together for (insert amount of time) so they don’t want to let go of what they had. Which is fair, but time really means nothing. It’s about who’s consistent and doesn’t do something to hurt their partner to this extent. I don’t care how long you’ve been together, as soon as you’re disrespected you’re under no obligation to stay. You sound desperate tracking her down. She’s giving you an attitude,  hits you with her car, and practically hooking up with someone else, give it a rest. That’s not love. That’s not someone who’s as devoted as they say. How much more obvious can it get? This is crazy behavior on her part. I hope you let go of your attachment. It’s over.

Edit: sorry for being so blunt but I would give my best friends the same advice. It’s not worth it. There are people who will treat you better. You’re still young and there are so many things to explore in this life at your age. Travel, find what you’re passionate about. The right person will come along when you’re actually ready and mature enough for a serious, committed relationship. Relationships that begin in the teen years and try to plan out a future are almost always doomed."

I nearly threw up because my entire mouth tasted as if I licked someone’s armpit with gnarly body odor.

Never again. I hate hummus."
