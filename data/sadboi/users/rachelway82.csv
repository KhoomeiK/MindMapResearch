How if you ignore them you are being rude and things could get violent, but if you are too polite in your rejection you are ""leading them on"". He had no idea.

After a few months she told me that she was putting in all of this work to be sober so we can have a relationship again and get her family back, but that if we were never going to forgive her there was no point and she should just start drinking again. I caved and moved back in with her and everything was good for awhile, but she ended up relapsing anyway.

I wonder if it wasn't so much that you felt good that you hurt them, but that it felt good to feel something. For me one of the worst feelings in the world is feeling nothing, feeling empty, or feeling invisible. I was just thinking maybe it wasn't that you were happy that you hurt them, but that you felt relieved to feel anything at all, and that someone noticed you. If someone doesn't already care about you, you can't really hurt them. They would just ignore you and move on.

When I was first diagnosed, I spent a lot of time reading about BPD, talking about BPD, reading other people talking about their BPD. It was great at first to finally feel accepted and feel like others could relate, but I honestly think I started to pick up new symptoms or notice my symptoms getting worse to almost ""fit the mold"" of having BPD. I definitely think I tended to pathologize everything, and think of everything in terms of having BPD.  In therapy we very rarely even talk about the diagnosis, or any of the terminology. We just talk about me, my feelings, my reactions, and what we can do to help improve them. I think a lot of people once diagnosed fall into the trap of ""well of course I am like this, I have BPD, I can't help it"" (or at least I did).

BPD,f3dzggv,t1_f3dz9lu,1570851811.0,"Yeah, that's what tipped me off that this person wasn't actually a psychiatrist."
jobs,f3dyxxi,t1_f3dxvf0,1570851321.0,"That is a fair question. I don't want to overshare, but I had some mental health issues that landed me in the hospital for awhile. I'm ready to go back to work, but I don't think I am ready to go back to a management position yet. At this point I just want to do something low stress to get back on my feet."
MurderedByWords,f30sg9h,t1_f30h7ul,1570561427.0,"In most cases it's not meant to ""fix your problems"" on it's own. But if you are too depressed or anxious to get out of bed, you aren't going to be able to work on your problems. Medication got me to a place where I could go to and engage in therapy and make positive changes, like getting a new job and getting my driver's license. Meds aren't always necessary, but it can be part of an overall treatment plan so that you can start to help yourself."
MurderedByWords,f30iui3,t1_f308kj1,1570555344.0,"The explanation was ALMOST correct, but not quite. My doctor explained that sometimes when you first start taking the medication it will improve your energy and motivation FIRST, before it helps with your mood and suicidal thoughts. So in that period you may be more likely to act on those thoughts because you are still depressed, but now more motivated. It can take up to 6 weeks to get the full effect, according to my Dr."
UMD,f2ubpna,t3_de4dow,1570412446.0,"It's always been trashy, it's actually gotten a lot better in the past 20 years. I can understand being unnerved by hearing about violent incidents lately, just make sure you stay alert to your surroundings and you'll be fine. I do find it interesting that in your list of murders and violent incidents that make you feel fearful, you lumped in the homeless guy that dares to exist in your presence... It's very telling.  Might want to go back to your affluent neighborhood, this might not be the right place for you."
UMD,f2u5bwo,t3_de7z79,1570407743.0,What on Earth did you think was going to happen? At the very least you lied on your original application. They could deny you readmission just because of that.

I just had to email Postmates to tell them what happened and they refunded it, but it was annoying that I even had to do that."

Sometimes I don't mind, but if I am paying a delivery fee and tipping, shouldn't they bring it to my door?"

youseeingthisshit,f25u25f,t1_f25hd9n,1569983824.0,I'd honestly rather get accused of being a kidnapper than to know this kid ended up getting hurt or worse because I didn't do anything.
youseeingthisshit,f25tuyi,t1_f25g85m,1569983674.0,I had to read this comment 5 times before I realized you didn't mean your 4 1/2  year old ran off to get married. 😔

PublicFreakout,f1lfm67,t1_f1kyfxh,1569553494.0,"Thanks, I'm okay but I just feel bad for everyone involved. The guy was clearly mentally ill and needed help, I feel bad for his family because they lost a loved one. I feel bad for the police who had to shoot him and are now being called monsters and told they are going to hell on social media for defending themselves and the community. I feel bad for the Starbucks employees who called the police on him. I feel bad that my niece is afraid to go back to that mall with her friends because she feels unsafe. It was really just a tragic situation for everyone involved."
maryland,f1leob7,t1_f1l6odr,1569552784.0,"I agree that more needs to be done about mental health, but I'm not sure what can be done in cases like this. This guy is a homeless guy who is well known in the area and clearly has some mental health issues. There absolutely needs to be more resources for people struggling with mental illness, but can it be forced if the person refuses treatment?"

AmItheAsshole,f1ck5hh,t3_d8mhu9,1569359264.0,"YTA for wasting your doctor's time. You are completely within your rights to not care about your health, and he would be completely within his rights to discharge you as a patient for non compliance. If you don't trust your doctor, go find a new one."

AmItheAsshole,f1at8cw,t1_f199dan,1569306169.0,He literally did talk to her directly. He expressed his needs and she called him a baby. Men are allowed to have needs.
AmItheAsshole,f1assy8,t1_f1a0bgi,1569305595.0,"If that is the case, she needs to explain that to him, not tell him he is being a baby. I'm sure there is a compromise they could come up with, but both of their feelings and needs are valid."
