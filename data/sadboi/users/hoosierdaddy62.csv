The game tonight (Wednesday) between Maccabi Tel Aviv and Andulo Zero in the Mivtah Menorah Hall is expected to take place without a crowd. But if you look at the Ministry of Health's guidelines, in light of the Corona eruption in Israel, it should not have existed at all.

Earlier, the Ministry of Health issued an official statement titled ""The 11 measures of the Ministry of Health to defend the Corona."" Article 1 was like this: ""Israelis returning from France, Germany, Switzerland, Spain and Austria will be charged with home isolation for 14 days. The decision is retroactive from the date of departure.""

How's that about canceling the game tonight, you ask? Well, Maccabi Tel Aviv played in Valencia, Spain, on February 21 - and returned to Israel the next day. 14 days have not passed since then, and Maccabi Tel Aviv players and the team members who have stayed with the team in the foreign game are currently in isolation."
