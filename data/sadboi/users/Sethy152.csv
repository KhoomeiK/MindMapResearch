Those are the two I love playing. Maybe give them a try?"
summonerschool,fqobgh3,t3_gk02l3,1589511548.0,"I’ve only recently started jungle. I play Fiddlesticks, and have about an 80% win rate. Things that helped me:

Get smite. You need it, you can’t jungle without it. Not only is it super useful jungling, but it gives you the ability to buy some of the most important items you can use. 

Gank when you know you’ll win. That’s it, if there’s a possibility that it won’t work, then it’s best to keep farming. 

If the enemy has no jungler, you’ll have a hay day. Get their red and blue buff, all their neutral minions, and you’ll be virtually uncontested with the dragons and rift herald. 

Don’t keep red and blue buff to yourself, take one most of the way down and give it to top or mid (red to top, blue to mid). 

Get as much vision as possible, remind your allies to get control wards and ward all the good spots. You’re in charge of keeping track of the enemy jungler."
summonerschool,fqoa3tg,t3_gjr14v,1589510722.0,"I’m a Zoe main, and Zed is very effective against her. Things to remember for any champion vs Zoe:

Dodge by sidestepping. Every time against a Zoe. You run away, you’re giving her free damage. She can’t turn her attacks, and sidestepping is the most effective dodge method. 

If she misses a Sleepy, and isn’t close to her tower, she’s dead. Attack all in once you dodge it. Her mobility is zero if she doesn’t have an E ready. 

Try NOT to use heal to win fights. She’ll pick it up and use it, gaining a passive (increased auto attack damage) and speed. Don’t flash away either, unless you’re going to your tower. Same thing as heal. 

If you do get hit by Sleepy, run toward her. Her damage scales with distance, so running toward her will mitigate the damage she’ll deal. 

Don’t hide next to walls, she can throw her Sleepy through it. Keep minions between her and you at all times. Her Paddle Star has some AOE, so don’t get too close to you minions if she uses it. 

Her Paddle Star is EXTREMELY easy to see coming, if you can see her. She throws it behind her first, and that’s your queue to juke it.

Counter question: how do you face a Zed as a Zoe?"

Gauntlets of Breaking:

This is a +2 magic weapon (the two gauntlets counting as one weapon) that deals 1d8 bludgeoning damage. When wearing these, you gain a +1 to AC, but can’t carry a shield or any other weapon (and successfully wield it). When using them to break something (whether by ripping, punching, smashing, crushing, etc) you deal an extra 1d12 force damage. These can be spiked so you can administer poisons with them. Optional: cursed. You cannot take these gauntlets off unless you break the curse or destroy them. Any damage you deal to something living (or undead), it deals the same amount to the user."
