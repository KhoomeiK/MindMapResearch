AskReddit,fnnzykz,t1_fnn2c4y,1587107152.0,"I‚Äôve been here at least twice as long as you have but sure, if being condescending gets you off.  
Internet interactions can teach people new things. Just because you are not openminded to learning about the experiences and perspectives of others, doesn‚Äôt mean others aren‚Äôt. People learn new things based on these interactions all the time. Acting like language doesn‚Äôt matter because it‚Äôs on the internet is beyond ridiculous.  
You can‚Äôt say you don‚Äôt judge others when all your comments have literally been judging me and the other user for having an opinion you don‚Äôt agree with. Like, at least be honest.  
Speaking of honesty, if you‚Äôre going to respond in bad faith, why even bother responding? We know why she did it, anyone can pick it up from the context of her comments. She obviously didn‚Äôt mean it maliciously but her words and language have an impact and she should be aware of that. It‚Äôs not just about the societal impact of gender stereotyping, it goes down to her children too. The language she uses around them will impact them, various studies have shown this and how gender stereotyping affects children psychologically and more.  
‚Äújust move on and don‚Äôt judge someone for typing it in a way you do not approve of‚Äù you mean like how you saw their comment and moved on? Mhm. Get off your high horse, you‚Äôve done the same thing as them except they did it to create awareness and you did it to feel superior."

AskReddit,fnm2736,t1_fnlltnm,1587063800.0,"That's not related being a communist. You should understand a word before attempting to use it as an insult.

And again, I'm not telling anyone \*how\* they can think. They can think whatever they want, but that doesn't mean others shouldn't try to educate them or make sure they are at least aware of the impact. If someone intentionally continues to use damaging language, regardless of the reason, that's on them but at least they know now.

I was explaining why the other user pointed out they shouldn't use that language (the negative societal impact being the reinforcing traditional gender roles and thus *gender stereotyping*).  Again, **change starts by calling out things like language and behaviors and educating them on the impact of their words or actions.** Fundamentally, I'm sure you know this. You've done the same, like when you defended a trans woman being misgendered. You saw someone using language and behaviors that had a negative impact and you called them out on it, correcting them.

Take a moment and think about how you would respond to that person if they told you the same things you've said here "" You're the problem in society "", ""You are trying to tell people how they can think"", or if they said that you insisting on using the correct pronouns was you ""bitching and crying"". Would you tell the trans woman, if she was upset at being misgendered, ""Words only matter to those who get offended easily.""

You felt that making the acknowledgement mattered, that the language mattered, because you know the impact it has. So did /u/Sarsmi.

I hope you understand."

Language has an impact. They‚Äôre not mom chores, they‚Äôre household chores. She doesn‚Äôt need to do them because she‚Äôs a mom. She needs to do them because she‚Äôs part of the household. If her husband does them, is he doing ‚Äúmom stuff‚Äù or is he doing household stuff? There‚Äôs nothing wrong with her deciding to do the indoor chores but to call them mom chores is a mistake that may seem small but actually had a huge impact.

On it‚Äôs own: I use it for cooking to do quick conversions when my hands are full or find substitutes for recipes. I check if my pets can eat certain things. I‚Äôve asked it for help with some video games (like ‚Äúwhere is the hidden tower located‚Äù) as well as how to spell things or even stupid questions like if it‚Äôs legal to own hedgehogs in Maryland. You can check store hours and if it‚Äôs close to closing it‚Äôll tell me how many minutes it closes in. You can also find out how long it takes to get somewhere. Heck, one time I couldn‚Äôt remember how old I was and I had to ask lol  
With a chromecast and a fairly okay tv (like even my cheap TV from 2007 works): you can just tell your mini to play shows on Netflix and stuff or pause it, go back thirty seconds, skip episode, increase the volume, or turn off your TV. Not using a remote is the beeeeeest.
With a smart plug: I use it for a floor lamp and it‚Äôs so much easier to tell Google to turn my lamp on instead of walking through a dark room and trying not to step on things. I could have bought a smart bulb but the smart plug I got from Amazon was way cheaper than those Philips Hue kits. Others use the smart plug for stuff like turning off their Christmas trees at night and similar stuff.  
With the IFTTT app (If This Then That): There are a ton of cool applets but my favorite and absolute life saver is the Find My Phone one. I love how you can even customize Google‚Äôs response to you so mine says ‚ÄúYou got it boss!‚Äù before calling my phone. Another cool one is the Star Wars Order 66 applet for androids I think, you give the command and the Imperial March starts playing on the mini.   
Finally, if you don‚Äôt like the Ok Google/Hey Google command, you can also say stuff like Hey Poophole, Ok Boomer, Hey Booboo (this made me laugh when I put the voice to John Legend‚Äôs), or simply, Hey Goo."

wholesomebpt,f1b2vuu,t1_f1b0982,1569321306.0,"White folks don‚Äôt lack representation and eurocentric beauty standards already tell white children and adults that they‚Äôre beautiful, graceful, confident, etc. Underrepresented groups recognize these moments because they‚Äôve often struggled against the world telling them they don‚Äôt meet those standards and therefore aren‚Äôt beautiful, etc when that‚Äôs not true in the slightest.   
Why see a happy moment and reach to find a way to be miserable over it?"
rva,f0uadm3,t1_f0u9i2p,1568936862.0,"Thank you, I really appreciate that. I'm waiting on a reply back from someone who reached out but if it doesn't work out, I definitely got you on that beer."
rva,f0u9zqv,t1_f0u8sf1,1568936671.0,"Absolutely, ridiculously limiting. Not surprised by it but definitely annoyed.    

If you're up for someone from reddit, I can add that you're looking for someone as well to my post? We're lucky the community here is so nice, I don't think you would have to make it up unless you want to."
rva,f0u8d2j,t1_f0u6v0j,1568935880.0,"I agree but I can also see the value of learning to find the connections. I noticed some folks just interviewing their other professors but since my other interview cancelled, my other professors are all too busy for a last minute interview.  
Honestly, making it up doesn't sound too bad. I'd just be worried about being found out so my last resort is calling my dad lol"
rva,f0u6oza,t1_f0u660m,1568935066.0,Yep! I had an interview lined up before but said they didn't want to be recorded and cancelled.

BPD,ezhvluv,t3_d14619,1567917283.0,"I'm unlearning this but it's hard. It feels really easy to do and it's satisfying to release the finishing blow but the damage is so hard to undo. I work a lot harder to keep things reined in now and mood stabilizers help so much. That small moment of whatever isn't worth the relationships I value and cherish.

What sucks was that it's so easy to hurt friends and those close to me but so hard finding a way to hurt my abuser (N mom). How do you hurt someone who doesn't care about anything but making your life miserable? I guess by being happy. I'm still working on that."

I know he‚Äôs not good for me, our friends have told me he‚Äôs not good for me, fucking HE has told me he‚Äôs not good for me (in the same call he told me he used to like me l.m.a.o) But this stupid heart wants who it wants and who it wants is the dorky guy who is so kind and understanding and is always there for me when I‚Äôm low and/or manic and has the same fet as me and literally checks off the main stuff of my list (funny, smart, glasses, etc). I love how he makes me laugh and cry with his silly and sweet words, I love how he calls me to tell me about new good and bad things in his life (and tells me before anyone else), I love how stupid romantic he is and how he sung me his favorite country love songs even though I‚Äôm a metal gal. I can‚Äôt quite say I love him just yet but I love so much about him.  
I‚Äôm having lunch tomorrow with him, just the two of us, and I‚Äôm literally so excited now I can‚Äôt sleep.  
Update: He cancelled on me y‚Äôall üôÑ why men great till they gotta be great?"
