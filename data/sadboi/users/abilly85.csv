>Harper’s  evidence at  trial was that  the  defendants  had  left  out  many  other more  private details about Wiseau’s life,  which they  had  learned  in  their  research.  Harper  described some of these personal facts as “highly sensitive” and “potentially devastating” and said they   did   not   include   them “because   they   did   not   advance   the   narrative   of   the Documentary.”

patientgamers,fo8cqbn,t1_fo8bvlp,1587594070.0,"Even on GC, the random encounters were a little bit much at times. Especially when the plot would pick up and I was excited to progress to the next story beat, but I would have to go through 5 random encounters to get from one room to the next. 

I say ""surprisingly robust"" because that's exactly how I felt at first - I thought the combat WAS simplistic. However, as the game progressed and I got to some of the more challenging bounties and bosses, I learned the importance of buffs and debuffs, matching the elements in your weapons to the enemies' weaknesses, even knowing which character has the highest Quick stat was important. I wasn't expecting to have to worry about any of that - again, not a turn-based combat fan usually - so I was just fine letting it be simple. But the game ended up making me care and enjoy the smaller aspects of the encounters.

I also just read your other comment: yeah I had no idea that there were so many gameplay tweaks between the DC and the GC versions. Mana doesn't regen after each encounter in GC, making protecting your spellcasters in battle MUCH more important. I'm really glad I played the GC version because reading your comments, I don't think I would've enjoyed the DC version nearly as much"
