PanicAttack,fqjn81i,t3_gj7dc2,1589412362.0,"You're not alone.  Unfortunately it comes with anxiety/panic. My advice is to go talk to a doctor if possible, adopt a healthy lifestyle and practice positivity and mindfulness."
Anxiety,fqcs4b2,t3_gi39fs,1589267119.0,I take hot showers to get clean and then before I hop out I turn on the cold. I also use ice packs throughout the day. My doctor says its helpful because it changes your physiology in a given moment.
MandelaEffect,fplpaa7,t1_fpl4fmk,1588716891.0,I think this is what I was looking for when I wrote the post. I feel like most movie/show ME posts are about scenes that can easily be found with a Google search. I don't know if people are more interested in likes or whatever but it seems many of those posts can be debunked. Going forward it would be nice if more people take the approach that you do regarding movies and shows.
StarWars,fp5816s,t3_gbdcay,1588319537.0,I need the final episode to be an hour long. This one gave me chills

Anxiety,fozc6zv,t3_gaarcc,1588188210.0,I also get these feelings daily when I'm not necessarily anxious. They're worse for about three days after panic attacks .
StarWarsBattlefront,fok4srg,t3_g7rrzc,1587835412.0,I never realized he'd look like a garden gnome with a hat on lol
PanicAttack,foedd6m,t1_foecwxm,1587701094.0,Thank you. Does it help you?
PanicAttack,foe3gfg,t1_fobx3di,1587695263.0,What is an ABC game? I'll try anything if it helps
StarWarsCantina,fo7o0gx,t3_g5zdrx,1587581602.0,Go to Celebration one year and you'll find thousands of positive fans.  I went a few years back in Orlando and it just cemented my love for Star Wars and the community.  If you have kids it's even better. When you see the looks on their faces as they meet cosplayers you'll realize outside negativity doesn't matter.

StarWars,fnlm0h5,t1_fnkm62d,1587055826.0,From the Footlocker website. They were on sale and they allowed me to use an additional discount. Honestly I would've paid full price lol
StarWars,fnkess0,t3_g25txv,1587024359.0,Thanks for posting this because I had no clue they existed. Mine arrive in 5-6 business days.
MaddenMobileForums,fnhr8v6,t1_fnhjzjd,1586967453.0,What else goes in the set though?
NoMansSkyTheGame,fmp1o7v,t3_fwl8la,1586272709.0,What's the complexity limit and what are the pros of turning it off?
MaddenMobileForums,fm8apet,t3_fto2pf,1585845930.0,Darren Waller is underrated imo. I use him against 96+ defenses and still get constant production.
StarWarsCantina,flc2mfc,t3_fnpeou,1585018343.0,"Rogue One. I remember squealing like a kid on Christmas the first time I saw Vader vs the rebels on a giant screen. The entire theater erupted with a mix of gasps, cheering, and  horror filled screams. It was amazing then and I still feel that way every time i watch that movie."
Anxiety,fk3hli3,t3_fg8o5g,1583833912.0,Water bottle and  Xanax. I don't use the Xanax but I take it with me just in case.
NewToEMS,fjnijy8,t3_feeexl,1583508159.0,"A woman I trained with was 101 pounds and she failed the physical test for our local AMR. She went on groupon and found a cheap one month fee for a crossfit gym nearby. After that month she was able to go beyond anything that was asked of her physically on the job and she's been a great EMT. Don't give up, go train at a gym and you'll be fine and ready for the job. Good luck"
community,fj6jxmd,t3_f4bpf4,1583073790.0,I always wanted this scene on a blooper reel because I just know the cast had to be in tears laughing.
progresspics,fivb3p5,t3_f9vd4r,1582757187.0,Good job!!! What's an ED?
Anxiety,fiso5yt,t3_f9kk3k,1582688986.0,"My psychiatrist said something to me that helped with my heart anxiety. He asked me what the percentage of people was that die from having  a heart attack. I guessed a very high percentage and I was wrong. Due to modern medicine and advancements the percentage of people that actually die of a heart attack is at an all time low. He explained to me that the worst that will probably happen is I could have a heart attack but then I'd go to the hospital and they could help fix me. It helped calm me, hopefully it helps calm you as well. Good luck in this fight."
MaddenMobileForums,fhqg7r2,t3_f4b5pj,1581803746.0,How do we get these?
MaddenMobileForums,fhjirxi,t3_f3kzc6,1581647238.0,Looks like Beanie Sigel
Anxiety,fhf9tyb,t3_eu9rpi,1581539121.0,I just left the ER after I saw a psychiatrist earlier in the day (she sent me for reassurance that nothing is wrong with my heart). Ekg was fine. I did have shortness of breath but according to the Doc that's also part of the deal. If your tests are good try to drill it into your brain that you are good. Eventually we'll all get thru this. Good luck
Anxiety,fhbq6dp,t3_f2brfs,1581447526.0,I haven't tried this but it crossed my mind to do so. I'm curious if this could actually work.
MaddenMobileForums,fh8zwmu,t3_f1wumz,1581370807.0,Is he better than Devante?
MaddenMobileForums,fgmqfpc,t3_ezek68,1580929956.0,Grind Arena and get stamina plus gems and coins.
Anxiety,fgmpzqy,t3_ezcxu9,1580929697.0,Did you feel physically better after vomiting? I've often felt the urge to vomit during an attack but I held it in. I'm wondering if releasing it could calm me down.
DC_Cinematic,fgmo0jf,t3_ez58v5,1580928508.0,I always wanted Johnny Knoxville to play Plastic Man
disneymagickingdoms,ffb4gr0,t1_ffaupai,1579751546.0,Awesome thanks

Arrowverse,fat9hb7,t1_fat8odn,1576335998.0,Is there any source on this? I've seen several people comment about this but I've never seen the actual quote. That Smallville scene seemed quite conclusive unfortunately.

cringe,eq7xxjd,t3_bxezzi,1559855175.0,I don't understand why people are judging this man based on a clip. If this was done on a live show I would guess that behind the scenes issues have come to a boiling point.
StarWarsBattlefront,epj974a,t3_bure1r,1559250055.0,What if Leia's abilities were switched with Finn's? This would make Leia more inspiring thru leadership abilities while Finn becomes more defensive. They could also add another ability to Finn where he could pull out a lightsaber for a limited amount of time.
StarWarsBattlefront,epj8fub,t3_buw6q2,1559249638.0,Skins across the board would be nice but especially for Luke. I would like to see Ahsoka for light and Thrawn for dark.
