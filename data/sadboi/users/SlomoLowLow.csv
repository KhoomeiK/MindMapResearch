I‚Äôve had to replace more than a handful of engines in 2019/2020 jeep cherokees and renegades. Junk from the factory burning a quart of oil every 250 miles. But this is the case with all modern mass produced vehicles. Always bound to be a bad batch. It‚Äôs why there‚Äôs so many class action lawsuits with every manufacturer for things like the transmissions in fords, the transmissions,rear ends, and engines in fiat/Chrysler vehicles, Hyundai engines, etc. Every manufacturer has their flaws, it just comes down to doing research and finding out what you are and aren‚Äôt willing to put up with.

MSILaptops,fevxyn8,t3_eqos8b,1579402943.0,"It isn't horrible to open it up and replace the fans. The worst bit of it all is the little connectors for the wifi cable. Anyway, the whole process goes about like this. There's like 15 or so screws holding the backplate on. You take those out and shove like a guitar pick or some sort of thin piece of plastic like that and wedge it between the cover and kinda work it around so you can pry it off. Once you have that off I unscrewed the battery and disconnected it so it was out of the way and so I knew there couldn't be any power going anywhere. After that there's a few ribbon cables above the battery to disconnect. You disconnect them with little clips you lift up on. Lift up the clip, pull the cable. There is also one very small ribbon cable near where the power button would be to disconnect. Once you have those disconnected you want to pop the little wires off of the wifi card. There's two of them and they snap on there like the snaps you would have on a coat. Once you have those disconnected there is a screw or two holding the wifi card into place. You'll remove that or those (I can't remember if there's one ore two, its been a few months) and remove the wifi card. The wifi card just kinda pops up once its unscrewed and you'll lift it up a bit and pull it out. From there there are I think four or five screws holding the motherboard down. They should be in opposite corners. Once you remove those you can gently lift the motherboard. The two wires for the wifi card are routed through the motherboard so you'll want to make sure to weave those out as you remove it as to not tear them. Once its out you can flip the motherboard over. With the motherboard flipped over there are a few more screws holding the heat sync to the board and one connector per set of fans. I removed those screws holding the heat sync to the motherboard and also removed the 3 small screws holding the fan in on the cpu side and I think there are 4 or 5 on the gpu side, anyway, remove those as well and disconnect the small connectors near the fans themselves. Once you have those screws out you can gently pry apart the two halves of the heat sync to wiggle the fans out of each side and replace em. Installation is the reverse of removal. I may end up making a write up for how to do it. A few months back I replaced both the cpu and gpu fans and now within the last week the cpu fan decides it wants to make noise again so I'll be tearing it apart and completely removing the heat sync and repasting it while I replace the fans. A bit more of a pain in the ass but with all of the screws out of the heat sync you're pretty much one terrifying pull away from having the heat sync off."

Not every pothead has cognitive deficits due to smoking.

Also, no, marijuana did not cause my bipolar disorder. It runs in the family. Grandma has it, mom has it, and I have it. It just be like that sometimes. With any study you should always take other things into consideration, especially things like sample size. You can skew any statistic based on the sample and make anything be whatever you would like.
