marvelstudios,fpk3ram,t3_gdwg1b,1588687391.0,"I really loved these movies. The first one caught me off guard and was such an experience. 

Oddly enough, my mom passed away in April the year part 1 came out. She died from complications from throat cancer. I had no idea about the scene with Quill's mom in Guardians 1. It hit super close to me and here I was secretly crying during the first five minutes of the movie. It holds a really special place in my heart. 

Then, in May of the same year my dad passed away, Vol 2 came out. I had a complicated relationship with my dad due to some shit that neither one of us could control and he wasn't in my life much since I was 8 (30 now). Then Quill's dad dies in that one. 

I always thought there was a bit of irony in that. I just hope that in Vol 3 that Quill doesn't have a sister that dies or my sister is screwed."

We get word that the police are searching cars because a parent said while she was dropping her kid off at the front of the school that she thought she saw someone in a truck with a shot gun.  Yet she still dropped her kid off and left! 

Then, one of the guys in my classroom gets called down to the office. He was a friend of mine and I knew he drove a truck. It turns out that what the woman mistook for a shotgun was a fucking steering wheel lock. 

We got taken off lockdown and it was the most talked about thing the rest of the school year. 

Why that woman thought she saw a gun and still dropped her kid off still boggles my mind. ‚ÄúWell Timmy, mom thinks she saw a gun, GOOD LUCK OUT THERE LOL‚Äù"

Got slightly suicidal during that period. I was too big of a chicken to do it but I didn‚Äôt care if I died.

It got to the point that we weren‚Äôt allowed to have them out during any point in the day. Not even during our lunch period. They claimed that we would send each other tests answers or something like that. 

Anyway, a friend of mine who was a year below me was tired of the rule and how rude teachers were when enforcing it. He literally looked at his phone to check the time and got it taken from him for the rest of the day. 

That next week he comes to lunch with two older/non functioning flip phones. He takes the first out and pretends that he‚Äôs talking to someone on it. A teacher was instantly on him. They walk over and hold their hand out for him to give it up. He looks at the teacher and then proceeds to break the flip phone in half and puts it in their hand. The teacher was speechless. She just walked away without saying anything.  He takes the second phone out and does the same thing again. The second teacher thought it was pretty funny. 

Flash forward to 2015 and I start working at the school as a student mentor. And now everyone is allowed to have their phones out pretty much at any time. How things change."
