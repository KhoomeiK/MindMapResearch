awfuleyebrows,fowmm03,t1_fow3dat,1588122775.0,"It's less bad to do it with a razor bc when you pluck it eventually can make the hairs grow back sparse if they grow back at all. That's how people run into issues with over plucking and not being able to grow them back out the same.

Shaving them wouldn't affect the way they grow since it's only superficial and not affecting the follicle in any way. The reason it seems so thick is bc when a new hair grows in, the hair goes to somewhat of a point and is thinner on the end so when it's growing in it might not be very noticeable. When you shave, it cuts the thin tip off so it's more blunt and noticeable. It doesn't actually make the hair thicker though. The hair will eventually be blunt-ended anyway if you trim your eyebrows 

I've been using a razor (the single bladed eyebrow shapers) for a long time and I love it because I don't have issues with hairs growing in patchy if I overdo it and it's super easy to maintain."

I recently learned about an anti-sex cult from the 1800's that was founded by a girl who had been traumatized in her youth from seeing her parents have sex in the bedroom they all shared. I think about that from time-to-time and think of that poor girl haha."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,foefa90,t3_g6p168,1587702349.0,"Practice!! I can totally relate to everything you are saying. This is something I've only somewhat recently started working on and it's gone hand-in-hand with my personal feminist awakening. 

I used to never speak up in class or other social situations but I have noticed that so much of the discussion is male-driven. I've had classes with almost a 50/50 ratio of men and women and been the only woman to speak up in a lecture, whereas 10 men all made comments. 

It's scary, but I think of the people who my perspective could help. My voice definitely shakes and I have cried on occasion, but at least I don't regret not speaking up. 

Specifically, I've had backlash for standing up for the LGBTQIA community since I'm in a very conservative area, but I just think about those who are secretly in the closet and are only hearing hateful things. I could help them, and that motivates me to speak up, even when I'm terrified."

Eyebrows,fnyc6k6,t3_g4layh,1587358866.0,"They are amazing!! Just use a little eyebrow shaping razor to shave the hairs you don't want. They're super cheap and less intense than tweezing because if you mess up the hair will still grow back normally instead of thinning out and growing back patchy. 

YouTube how to shape eyebrows! There is some pretty cool info on there. 

Only do a little at a time though and only spend 5-10 minutes on it at a time then go for a walk or something because it's so easy to go overboard if you're glued to the mirror. 😅"

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,fnrpt1q,t3_g3e3g4,1587197066.0,"I could absolutely be overthinking this though, I just worry a lot about putting the helper and the victim in a risky situation. Lots of abusers don't get punished enough. What if he realizes who helped and goes after this girl who is not a trained professional? 

Anyways, I mainly wanted to be redirected to the post that was made the other day because it was really insightful and had some amazing thoughts on both sides. Unfortunately I couldn't be too specific in the title due to the 300 character limit."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,fnrp1op,t1_fnr5jt4,1587196301.0,"I think it's dangerous to be a middle-man when you are not a trained professional. It is more risky to have them text you under a guise than to have them save the help number as someone else's name. 

Not only that, but if something went amiss (you missed a call in an emergency situation, didn't read your texts, accidentally made the wrong move, etc) then it would be on you, when you shouldn't put that on yourself in the first place. That's a lot to take on. 

Whereas these organizations specialize in how to discretely report abuse, they have a local phone number that is available 24/7, a secret exit on their website so there isn't a trace of you visiting, and they have professionals doing everything. They can come to the rescue whereas if you're the middle-man, you're just passing that message along, making the process longer and potentially putting the victim at risk. 

Not only that, but it can be extremely dangerous to intervene in these situations and you could end up putting your life in danger as well.

I'd love to hear your opinion. These are newer thoughts I've had as we've just covered domestic violence in my women's safety class at university. A few weeks ago I probably would have posted the same thing on my wall but now I'm questioning if that's a good option at all."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,fnroeum,t1_fnrgfjp,1587195667.0,"I definitely agree! I'm trying to put my finger on it. 

Maybe it's that I worry if someone calls or texts in an emergency situation, she won't answer in time or give poor advice. And it's a lot to put on someone who isn't a trained professional. 

I think it would be better to post the resources instead and maybe suggest they save the numbers to the support center as her name or something to avoid suspicion. The website also has a safe exit where it'll immediately change back to the website you were on before and will delete the history. 

I think it would be a lot safer to avoid the middle man in this situation, especially if this partner is controlling enough that he'd look through messages. If he found it it could be even worse and the people who could really help wouldn't even be aware of the situation."
femalehairadvice,fnqfndw,t3_g37599,1587163667.0,"You are super gorgeous and have a wonderful bone structure so you could absolutely pull it off! I shaved mine 2 days ago and it has been an amazing experience so far!

I saw above that you are worried a bit about patchiness as it grows in. Something you could consider is using minoxidil (generic Rogaine) on your scalp. Supposedly it helps with androgenic alopecia as long as you are using it consistently, so it could be an option at least until your hair is long enough. At Walmart, Target. Or Costco you can find some formulated for women for pretty cheap. 3 bottles which is about 3 months supply is $20.

They offer free therapy, support groups, classes and a bunch of other services for those who are victims of abuse. The organizatiom also provides follow-up and aftercare services for the women and children and have some transitional housing units.
