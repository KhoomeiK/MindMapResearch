football,fmurbqk,t3_fxclw9,1586397200.0,I watched more of Le Tissier than Gazza. Le Tissier had an amazing touch and was a very clever footballer. He never really looked like he was trying that hard. I always thought how much more of an impact could he have had playing for a better side.
TheExpanse,fmnqexj,t3_fwbqrs,1586232431.0,"Thanks...I’m most likely getting the two stories mixed. 

It is interesting to think about this but I still struggle to see how it makes sense. It gives the PM a sense of magic that i struggle with. Why would Julie reach out to Miller? Did she nudge the star helix boss to put him in the case and then pull his strings to get him to Eros? This takes away Miller’s agency. It means his redemption character arc is not real.  

Also, if the PM’s target was earth then it doesn’t make sense in my mind to use a low impact individual. If it can ‘control’ people why not reach out to others?"
TheExpanse,fmnj84t,t3_fwbqrs,1586227317.0,"There was no connection. Miller became infatuated with Julie through the kidnap job case. Julie wasn’t aware of miller until she met him on Eros. I vaguely remember the bird scene, but I think it just served to show Miller reflecting on what he needs to do and projecting Julie later in a scene.

In other words, Miller sought out Julie, not the other way around.

That’s my understanding anyway."
football,fmkoqah,t3_fvup51,1586162650.0,"That’s a hard question because marketing and success go hand in hand. 

Man City had a substantive supporter base before they were bankrolled and won trophies, but also built on this through marketing. Others like Leeds United seem to have a faithful and pretty large base for a championship club but I don’t see much marketing from them, even though I’m a fan.

As someone that watched football in the 90s I think that some of the Italian giants have been less successful in their marketing; in my circle people rarely talk about the Milan and Rome clubs, Juve, etc as much as they used to, although this might be changing. 

Just my thoughts."

TheExpanse,fmiall1,t3_fup07m,1586105747.0,The show is underrated. I’ve struggled to get people to watch it. Part of the issue is there is so much good tv out there (apparently) that is easier to get into. If you don’t pay attention to the first few episodes the story is difficult to follow. It also shows that there isn’t a huge appetite for space opera. I’ve watched seasons 1 to 3 at least 4 times.

Fatherhood,fm026iv,t3_fs7l7x,1585641785.0,"Same situation as you. We persisted with the attachment parenting. For our first child it worked well. For the second child it was much more challenging, he is over two and has not slept through the night and needs one of us to hold his hand every night to sleep and often comes into our bed. It is tiring but I don’t mind. I do it to support my wife who believes in this approach. I don’t think one approach is better than the other, it really comes down to individual parents. 

I know the books etc say that attachment parenting leads to more emotionally Grounded kids but I don’t see any difference. However I like the closeness and meeting their needs. 

Is one approach better? I’d need a carbon copy of the same child to tell you. 

Aside from the philosophy of what works for the kids it’s also important to consider what works for the parents.

Good luck debating this stuff with your wife :)"

Other than what Miller’s ghost said we don’t know if the gods eye was from the builders or destroyed them/their artifacts. I am not sure that the word “goths” is used in the book either  (I could be wrong). All we know is that there was feedback from “something” based on the Laconia experiments and there are some weird reanimated individuals like Amos, and this kids. What Duarte is remains to be seen.


Just my interpretation. I am tempted to read/listen to the books again because I’m sure I’ve missed some details."

I think Ashford and Camina are fantastic and convincing and have great dynamics.

The only downside is that it comes with its own power connector rather than a generic one.

In my experience wireless headphones are prone to more faults; so best to buy from a reputable seller so you can make an easy return."

In the books there doesn’t seem to be limits to his abilities. He seems confident of winning a standoff with every person whether they are skilled military personnel or gangster. Almost to the point where there is little expectation of him losing (even though Murtry gets the better off him).

The only time he acknowledges his limits is when he states that he Bobby is a different caliber of fighter.

football,ev8zeyt,t3_ciouw9,1564298165.0,"It’s no so bad if the tackler is a good tackler. I played a mixture of different levels of football and at the higher levels tackles were relatively clean because the player would have the experience and athletic ability to pull it off, this means as an attacker you just need to ride the tackle or go down safely. When an inexperienced tackler tried often they will miss time the tackle and hit the player, but also as a “better” attacker it’s easier to get to the ball first by judging their tackle but the tackler will often go right through you.

As an attacker a key skill is being able to ride the tackle, you don’t want to stand up to every tackle. Some players get a hard time for going down easy, but if you are getting tackled 10 times a game you simple can stand up to all of them and expect to be injury free.

running,ev5tyqh,t3_cidq5e,1564238687.0,"I use jaybird x3 Bluetooth wirelessly headphones. They cost a little bit more than the I would usually spend (around 100us) but the fit and sound is fantastic. They are super light and are barely felt. The ear peices are connected by a thin cable with a small control on it. They are clearly designed for sport and great for running, the battery life is about 5-6hrs. I’ve had them for 6 months and have not had issues of them falling During Running.

My main gripe with them is that they come with a unique charger which means that you can’t charge them using a normal micro USB.

The other annoying thing, that I have found with other headphones, is that the small ear piece rubber parts can fall off in your bag, pocket etc and you need to replace/ find them. I hate this about many types of running headphones,"
