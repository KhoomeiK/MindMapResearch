I can't imagine if it drops lower if I get sick, even went to do a test a week ago in case it was COVID since I work in a hospital too.

I'm struggling heavily with GERD to the point I can't even eat for days sometimes, now it's really bad because I gotta wear a mask at work for 12 hours long and it's awful, I get so nauseous, it triggered my asthma too that was under control for over 3 years. In the morning is usually the time I get all my palpitations and all that, I also have TMJ and have scalopped tongue often and apparently grind my teeth as well, got a night guard since that also helped for sleep apnea but not UARS.

It's really common of people with TMJ having one of those so I highly recommend checking it out if you are that tired for sure.

My jaw dentist said since I know my sleeping disorders started like 20 years ago sometimes the inflammation is so intense in the throat that it can take a really long time to get better. When the appointment are gonna restart I'm going to get CPAP then if it doesn't work I'll try BIPAP since anyway the treatment I'm doing is 3 years I'm going to need one of those for sure because my oxygen saturation drops too much. You could check if your issues are coming from other things, if you have sinus or issues in your nasal airway, try to find the root of the problem, mine is definitely the jaw which restricted my airway. Since I also have sinus issues it might be something there but seems like the sinus issues are caused by the problems I have now according to my ENT. It is complicated, cost tons of money and takes a lot of patience to try different treatments and find what works for you. What works for someone might not work for you and vice versa.

Could be link to some sleeping disorders like sleep apnea or upper airway resistance syndrome that are causing the GERD as well, or chronic sinusitis which also could cause the cheek pain and throat symptoms. You could also be unlucky like me and have all of those together caused by your TMJ. You could get nasal spray and start using it daily and see if it improves, if linked to your sinus it could possibly help.

I'm now 30 and got diagnosed last year with sleep apnea and upper airway resistance syndrome, caused by a restricted airway due to my jaw, we also learned that my jaw didn't grew properly, dentist suspected it happened around that time as well.

I'm in Canada and it took me 10 years to get a diagnosis that I ended up finding myself, the doctors kept thinking I had brain tumour or MS and we're not able to find anything. I got my TMJ diagnosis after then 6 more diagnosis following this, all related to my TMJ somehow, 2 more diagnosis possibly coming soon. Nothing is covered at all for TMJ treatment and anything to treat my severe sleeping disorders, which is bullshit, our healthcare system is really broken. Hopefully I'll see huge difference soon, I'm having a really bad week so it's awful now. I'll definitely post about it once I see a major difference, should be soon I hope.  It really works my patience that whole thing. I don't get how insurances don't cover this, I guess they know that it'll cost them too much money but seriously it should be consider like a serious health problem."
TMJ,fhrly6i,t1_fhrkw0g,1581830092.0,"I'm sure eventually, hopefully I'll get through this, it's the roughest time of my life at the moment, I'm so broke due to all the expenses I had due to TMJ and the related sleeping disorders diagnosis I got as well, nothing is covered so I put myself in massive amount of debts to get treatment and hopefully it'll work because then if not I have no idea what I'm gonna do, fortunately my dentist is really hopeful the treatment will work for my symptoms and the tests she did show the same. 

Hopefully when I can afford to go out and do activities again I'll find friends that will be worth it and be there. This group and the others I'm in can really feel like we're a family sometimes, we all have our inside jokes about what we are going through that no one else understands as well. We gotta stick together with the crap we are going through, and yes an happy and pain free life is what we all deserve for sure, hopefully soon!!"

I'm sure I would've never survive the last year without all the support groups on Facebook and here about the different health issues I have all link together, it's nice to be able to talk to people that lives the exact same thing as you, I don't have much support around me, very few are the friends that stayed with me when I got really sick and started getting vertigo all the time and many more symptoms."

Menieres,fhpai21,t1_fhjcfev,1581785167.0,"You seem really similar to me, I had pain in my back but also have a scoliosis so I always thought it was that, pain in my ears was rarely there and eventually it was always there, but it took years. If the viral medications work though i dont know, the jaw treatment can be worth it anyway because if untreated for really long you can develop a lot of other serious stuffs like sleep apnea and more but it's really expensive, it's something you never know. There's no one test to confirm it is exactly the cause, you know when you do the treatment and that's it. I know everyone that got their hearing back from TMJ treatment did the LVI global treatment. It can be worth it for you to pay for the consultations and scans/MRI to see what's the extent of the damage in this area, if the discs are displaced and nerves are compressed there's a lot more chance that it is the exact cause. It's really complicated to know exactly, like I did the ECog and have the endolymphatic hydrops diagnosis but the neurotologist says I'm too atypical, but he also refuses to see any link with TMJ, I talked to 20 people that got their hearing back from TMJ treatment and were similar to me so I believe it's the cause and the TMJ test showed it was probably it too. I know endolymphatic hydrops can be cause either from Meniere or something else like sometimes brain injury or trauma, my guess is my TMJ and the nerves being compressed is causing trauma in that area, I'll know for sure while I'm further in the treatment, I have too many reasons to do it now anyway even if it doesn't fix my ears completely."

Menieres,fhgh1qx,t1_fhg2hrc,1581566936.0,"I had no jaw pain till I actually started doing physiotherapy for it, then the constant ear fullness that I had almost daily was gone, now only once or twice per month, and occasional ear pain moved directly to my jaw. I do have a over bite and it's misaligned but never thought it was causing me that much problems. There's lots of symptoms related to TMJ you can research a bit more about it and go see a specialized dentist to see in case. I know many people that I talked to that did the LVI global treatment for TMJ and got their hearing back that way, that's one of the main reason why I chose this treatment. I don't count on it though since my jaw is compressing my nerves for quite a long time I rather not expect any changes and if it happens I'll be very happy for sure. I do have lots of mild vertigo and did attacks with some vomiting but since I started treating sleep apnea it didn't happen once, just some mild vertigo and dizziness but not to the point that I'm sick. Also it was moving around but not spinning like typical Meniere. So many things can cause those symptoms but I think it's really good to check off this one since no doctors will actually mention this, I wish someone told me way earlier so I could've treat it earlier before it did that much damage."

I even talked to 20 people that their hearing came back while doing the exact same treatment I'm doing but I don't count on it since I'm sure the nerve damage is too far gone right now. I already see some improvements so it's really encouraging, just wish I knew earlier because it's really bad now. I'm glad there's treatment possible though and that I'll get better, I'm in a massive amount of debts due to all those but being healthy has no price and it's necessary."
Menieres,fhf0kvr,t1_fhezs3r,1581533731.0,"Hearing loss, tinnitus, vertigo, dizziness, ear fullness/pain, neck/back pain, migraine, headaches, fatigue, brain fog were my main symptoms. A year ago on February 15th I woke up deaf and everything was moving on waves like I was on a boat, then hearing came back a bit I had 45% hearing loss instead of my usual 35% loss but I had terrible ear fullness and pain like someone was sticking a knife right in my ears and turning it, that's when my ENT said he made a mistake and I definitely did not have Meniere, someone on a Meniere support group on Facebook told me to check for TMJ then I did 4 consultations with TMJ specialized dentist and all of them told me I had it. The last one I saw was a LVI global one and he sent me do a sleep study in a lab because he told me I most definitely had upper airway resistance syndrome, turned out I had both sleep apnea and UARS. Then I started doing physiotherapy for the jaw, neck(TMJ gave me forward head posture) and vertigo, that's only after doing physio for a while that my pain in my jaw started, the pain from my ears moved directly to my jaw. I did many tests and scans since and we realized both of my discs are completely displaced, every time I open my mouth my condyle bones rub directly on my ear bones and it's affecting all the nerves in this area."
Menieres,fheypoe,t1_fhexlqd,1581532634.0,"My brother had TMJ too! My mom paid for his treatment when he was young and she didn't for mine so I probably started sleep apnea at 10 years old due to it, it's been getting progressively worse since and 20 years later I have severe TMJ and sleep apnea, it's all linked. I really wish I knew earlier than a year ago because now it did a whole lot of damages and I have so many diagnosis related to all this. I'm doing treatment, vertigo has already been getting a bit better with TMJ treatment, my jaw joint is compressing my ears, the morning is awful too because I don't really sleep at all it makes it much worse, I never sleep longer than 72 seconds at the time. With the treatment my airway should double in size and it'll get much better for sure, it just takes 3 years so gotta be patient."
Menieres,fhexbe3,t3_f2oci1,1581531813.0,"For Meniere you need absolutely to have spinning vertigo, if it moves around and it most definitely isn't Meniere, and also low tone hearing loss is necessary to do a proper diagnosis, with tinnitus and ear fullness on top of all the other symptoms. You absolutely need to pass an MRI to check off other options that do the exact same symptoms, I highly recommend to do a consultation with a TMJ specialized dentist to check this option off as well, I was misdiagnosed with Meniere for 3 years to learn it was my jaw instead causing all the issues, but the diet changes never affected me (salt, sugar, caffeine, tobacco, alcohol, gluten, dairy.. I tried to cut them all off and nothing changed), I also didn't had any low tone hearing loss, my hearing loss is in every tone besides the lowest tone. Also if you have it when waking up I recommend reading about sleep apnea and upper airway resistance syndrome, I talked to many people that got dizziness and mild vertigo from it, it can affects the ears too since it affects the blood flow in the inner ear, it's really often linked to TMJ also like in my case. It could be vestibular migraine but you don't seem to have any of the bad symptoms that VM and Meniere have, I wouldn't think right now you have it at all since what you describes doesn't sound like it at all, you can still go see an ENT and pass the test, MRI first, auditive test, VNG can be good to see if there's damage in the vestibular system. if needed there's other test used for Meniere like ECog but most of the time it isn't necessary."

I did a VHIT and ECoG intra then got diagnosed with endolymphatic hydrops but also TMJ that affects my nerves right in the ears area and also sleep apnea and UARS which can affect the blood flow in the ears so I’m sure my jaw is the cause of all my ear symptoms, just started treatment for it but since doing physio for jaw my ear fullness is almost gone completely. Just make sure you find some doctor an ENT or neuroTOlogist that will send you do all the proper test, mri is absolutely needed and also VNG to get the Meniere diagnosis, even then make sure you don’t have anything else and research a whole lot by yourself, try to do some diet changes immediately to see if it helps (salt, sugar, caféine, alcohol, gluten and dairy can all be triggers) What I did is stop everything then adding one by one those and see, it didn’t change anything for me but again it wasn’t Meniere since my endolymphatic hydrops is too atypical to be this."
