Also I’m in an illegal state too. I have edibles, but they take too long to kick in, and they’re far too expensive for me to be taking every day. That’s why I smoked carts, because they lasted a while."

I was delighted when this girl I had met asked me if I was Filipino. I’m Chinese, and I was confused as fuck, and when I asked why she thought that, she said that I was “Filipinos are usually very outgoing and musical”. Don’t want to go into the semantics of that sentence, but that boosted my confidence big time, and that instance was the only time I got approval from another person that I seemed confident. 

I still feel like utter shit at the end of every day, so I don’t know it it’s really working. For the record, when I had low self confidence, I never felt like complete shit at the end of the day. It was only when I started becoming more sociable that I felt this terrible at the end of the day. Has anybody felt something like this?"

He just acted coy about missing his many shots because he knew that the audience was watching, and in doing this mislead the audience to believe that he intentionally missed his shots to toy with Rickon.

It wasn’t until the last shot when Ramsay realized that Rickon was a fucking plank.

I guarantee that Rickon would have lived if he had just stood still. Ramsay would have shot around him in anticipation of movement, and therefore would have run out of arrows, allowing Rickon to walk safely to Jon."
