leagueoflegends,fqhksh4,t3_giy32x,1589378984.0,I think last season Riot basically increased damage of all champions in the game so profesional games would be more fun to watch. This made certain champions unplayable and solo q way less fun. For example a few patches ago Sejuani had no problem oneshoting adc and supports doing more dmg than adc for the first 20 minutes of the game.

Read my other reply to OP’s comment. I don’t like the idea of putting MacBooks on stands either. I think it’s better to get an external display. They probably cost as much as your fancy iPad stands. 

In conclusion, I would have a problem if instead of the iPad it was a MacBook and it seems like you are the close minded person here for not willing to accept other people may have different preferences."
ipad,fo7lbav,t1_fo7jzej,1587580278.0,"Depends how you use it. I think if you plug it to another external monitor and then add keyboard and trackpad it makes sense.  Basically a two screen setup with Magic Keyboard and Trackpad, just one of the screens is a MacBook. Honestly, I’m not a huge fan of it either. 

What you did is one screen, two stands, two keyboards and two trackpads.

Anyways, it’s just my opinion and you should do whatever works best for you. If this setup works for you then I don’t see a reason why you shouldn’t use it."

Another crazy thing, I was playing with someone whose summoners name was BLACK NI***R. Yes, the N word (hard r). Of course, I reported the guy. Checked his lolking after a few days - still fine, no ban, no name change.

I’m starting to think Riot doesn’t even care about it anymore. They stopped banning people, because why would they lose another potential customer. League community is becoming more and more toxic."

I like AM’s UI a lot more than what Spotify has to offer. Speaking for my experience, Spotify has definitely better recommendations and social features if that’s something you care about. I use a separate app for podcasts, so I’m not a fan of Spotify mixing everything in the same place. I think they are so similar that switching form one to another is too much hustle."
