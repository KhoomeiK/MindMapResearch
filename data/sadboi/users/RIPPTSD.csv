When I stressed my own desire to be productive, I just ended up more down on myself in the end because I wasn't living up to it.

ptsd,foh2ehn,t3_g7by8g,1587759750.0,100%. PTSD increases function of the amygdala (fight/flight/freeze response) and decreases hippocampus function (calm/rational part of the brain) which literally means when we are suffering from PTSD we are on higher alert and are more anxious basically all the time than people who don't have PTSD. That is why meditation and grounding can really help - because the opposite is also true: decreasing physical symptoms can help decrease mental ones.

Trauma does not discriminate based on race/color/creed/education/etc., (though some people may be, unfortunately, even more vulnerable based on some of these things). Neither do the symptoms it leaves in its wake. I think if you talked to other sufferers, you'd find you can empathize with one another easily because the similarity of trauma suffering transcends all other differences. I assume anyone who would try to invalidate your experience simply can't/won't understand it. But let me tell you now, your trauma is incredibly valid, and I am so sorry you are suffering. I hope you get the help you need and you are able to understand that this is a terrible thing that never should have happened to you. You didn't choose it, and you didn't choose PTSD either. And yet you experienced/are experiencing both, which is as real/valid as it gets, regardless of anything else in your life or past."

Does that help?"
ptsd,fk017j7,t3_ffay54,1583737108.0,"You lived through your trauma(s), and that makes you incredibly strong and badass on its own, no need to compare yourself to anyone else! You keep doing whatever you need to do to process it, cry, scream, run,  whatever helps you, and that is the strongest and best you can be. Any other victim of trauma has been where you are, and if they are 'better' it may well just be because they gave themselves the time to cry and made space for that. 

I remember my therapist telling me that trauma recovery is not about judging yourself, and that I had to learn to be kind to myself before I was going to be able to really recover, judging myself harshly and wondering why I wasn't yet 'over it' was only serving to make things harder. When I finally just started making room for my own emotions and stopped trying to compare myself to anyone else, that's when I actually started making the most strides. 

So seriously next time you find yourself thinking like this, remind yourself that it's natural to feel 'pathetic' after a trauma because trauma recovery is really freakin difficult. And then do something that you find super comforting (that's healthy), like make tea and curl up with a good book, take a long bath/shower, watch a tv show you love, just whatever makes you feel comforted.

One thing that might be of interest to you is the PCL5, it's a self-report checklist of PTSD symptoms (not a formal diagnosis), but can help tell you if what you are feeling is in line with traditional PTSD symptoms, since you asked about that. 

You answer the questions and then literally add your score up (each number you chose) and they say ""A total score of 31-33 or higher suggests the patient may benefit from PTSD treatment...such as Prolonged Exposure (PE), Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT), or Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR).""

So there were definitely times I ended up saying to my husband, ""I am sorry I yelled at you, I know you didn't do anything wrong, I am just struggling so much with PTSD and therapy and I am exhausted, don't take it personally.""

Looking at the stuck points will help you do that because it will get into the cognitions you have stored along with the memory, which are giving you the I hate the world/life feeling.

ptsd,fjocvh1,t3_fean6y,1583525212.0,"This is a super normal PTSD symptom, so please don't feel alone. PTSD is characterized by two main things: negative cognitions and avoidance. Compartmentalizing allows us to avoid all the bad memories and thoughts which feels fantastic in the short run, but the research literally shows that the more we avoid in the short run the more the memories and feelings will come back full force in the long run. That is our brain's way of saying, 'Hey, you still haven't dealt with this and it was pretty bad, so we should take a look.' Point is, extremely normal. Also very normal is analysis paralysis with big life decisions. I don't know if this is your experience, but it certainly was mine, that I worried about making decisions after my trauma because I didn't know how to ensure that I wouldn't end up in another bad situation, and I worried that any decision I made might end up leading to another trauma.

In my experience, the only way to actually get the trauma to stop overturning your life is to get help. I did prolonged exposure, and by reliving the memory over and over I got used to it. It feels like I was finally actually able to put it away, as opposed to temporarily shoving it under the rug. Now when things remind me of my trauma, I can look at the memory without fear or flashbacks or nightmares, and then put it away again. I can also make big life decisions again and trust in my own ability to do so. I guess what I am saying is therapy made it so I control my trauma instead of the other way around. I highly recommend it!"
ptsd,fjobmlo,t3_fehsqb,1583524505.0,"I want to say so many things to you right now, but I think the most important one is this: **The one and only person at fault for what happened to your sister (and you) is your abuser.** That is it, period, the end. No sister should ever be in the position of trying to protect her loved one from abuse. That is not on you, there is no guilt or shame for you to bear, because the only one who did something wrong is the one who regularly abused you and your sister and robbed you of your childhoods. Really commonly with PTSD we look back at the situation and try to figure out what we should have done differently to keep it from happening, but that is inherently fucked up. We should not have to think about how to prevent ourselves or loved ones from being abused because NO ONE SHOULD ABUSE US. So next time you feel guilt or shame, remember that the only person who should feel that is your abuser. Leave that with him. He has put you through enough, no need to take on responsibility for what he did, something that you could not have prevented and should have never had to try to prevent.

Also, I would like to say it sounds like you are doing everything right. You are an incredibly strong and badass survivor, and you care deeply and fiercely about your sister. You are doing the best you can dealing with a shitty thing that never should have even happened to either of you. As for your sister, everyone deals differently, (which is also not your fault) and drugs and alcohol use are a common symptom of PTSD as well because they help us forget/avoid horrible memories, at least in the short run. So using is, unfortunately, quite common, and you can't beat yourself up that that's her coping mechanism. I think you would both greatly benefit from therapy, maybe you could try it out together sometime! Processing the memories and realizing that your sister doesn't blame you and you have no reason to blame yourself might really help you, and therapy to help with the PTSD could help her using issues in the long run too!

Again, so sorry that this happened to you. Keep on surviving, you are clearly incredibly strong and resilient. I would take you as my sister any day."
ptsd,fjoalif,t1_fjnq2cv,1583523914.0,"Oh and one other thing! If you were doing prolonged exposure treatment, which it sounds like you were given that you had to relive the trauma, and that was too much, you can talk to your psych about switching to CPT, in which you do not necessarily have to relive the trauma, you do more homework on cognitions and processing instead of exposures. Both types are evidence-based and see great success rates. Then maybe therapy would be more approachable!"
ptsd,fjoadw0,t3_feex0z,1583523790.0,"What you are going through is SO normal!! Emotional numbing is one of the most common symptoms of PTSD, it's a way for us to shut off the floodgate for a while, and I certainly felt it regularly. And then for me it was always anger or guilt that would still break through, which is terrible because only feeling negative things sucks. But I would feel these little bursts of happiness every once in a while, just like the one you mentioned, and I had to hold on to the fact that only processing the trauma would allow me to have more moments of happiness like that (AKA because emotional numbing is a symptom of PTSD, relieving the PTSD helps the happiness come back)! And I am not just hypothesizing, I completed prolonged exposure treatment, and even though it got worse before it got better (and I remember the days of being totally exhausted and needing sleep after therapy), ultimately I walked out on the last day without PTSD, not suffering from flashbacks, nightmares, rage, or insomnia, and very much able to experience happiness normally again!!! So I hope that gives you some hope that it's temporary, and an expected and normal symptom that can be mitigated.

I honestly don't think I could have lived with all my symptoms for too long, and therapy helped me completely get rid of the flashbacks and the nightmares, so it was so very much worth it.

I 'overcame' my trauma at least in the sense that I don't have PTSD anymore, so I wanted to tell you what that felt like for me with respect to my identity. I also felt an instant severing in my thoughts and emotions after my trauma, a total change in both self-perception and world view, and it was very sudden. I did, basically, reconstruct my world view and self-perception through treatment, but it was far less instant, and it didn't necessarily align perfectly with what I believed before treatment (AKA treatment was not about just getting back to my old beliefs, it was about examining what had changed and being thoughtful about my new beliefs). So I definitely walked out of therapy on the last day as a totally changed person, but it happened little by little over many sessions with a ton of conscious effort."
ptsd,fjhn9u2,t1_fjhn5ol,1583351422.0,"You can definitely get there! I know the road seems long and crappy, but it made exactly that difference for me. I believe in you!"
ptsd,fjhmrup,t1_fjhlebl,1583351139.0,Totally counts! Awesome that you found an option that works for you!
ptsd,fjhmox7,t1_fjhkocc,1583351092.0,"It was definitely normal for me! I remember telling my husband I wish there was a place I could go to just smash things, because I felt so much rage. But I always tried to remember that the short term sucked to make the long term SO MUCH better. I was withdrawn, angry, screaming at loved ones, etc., in the short term while I was doing PE, (they all understood and forgave me!), but in the long run I am now flashback-free, nightmare-free, I can work, focus, eat, sleep, function  normally, and I am obviously a huge supporter of PE. Let me know if that makes any sense at all. Happy to talk about it more!"
ptsd,fjhm7r9,t3_fd7mw5,1583350822.0,"So sorry to hear you are struggling with this! One thing that really helped me was filling out the PCL5, which is a self-report checklist that helps you understand if you might have PTSD. (I am not a clinician, I just wanted to understand if what I was experiencing fit with PTSD.) If you want to try it out, you can find it here:  [https://www.ptsd.va.gov/professional/assessment/documents/PCL5\_Standard\_form.PDF](https://www.ptsd.va.gov/professional/assessment/documents/PCL5_Standard_form.PDF). Just add up your score (the literal numbers you chose) and if it's 33 or higher they say that is ""a reasonable value to use for provisional PTSD diagnosis."" Might help you understand if you should try going back to therapy for PTSD?

Other than that, for everyday coping and helping me relax, I practiced a lot of meditation/mindfulness, grounding and breathing techniques, as well as progressive muscle relaxation. These are all things you can Google, and there are a lot of great guided apps for them too.

But for long term coping I went through prolonged exposure treatment, which helped me habituate (get used to) the memories, and once I did that I actually stopped having flashbacks altogether. My therapist explained to me that the brain resurfaces traumatic memories on purpose when they haven't been fully processed, so the most effective thing a person can do is actually process the memories, which is what PTSD therapy helps with. So I know I am a bit of a broken record, but I highly recommend PTSD-specific therapy. Mine saved my life, and absolutely got me back to functioning like a 'normal person.' I believe it can do the same for you! 

By the way, even though you weren't originally diagnosed with PTSD, I want to congratulate you for going through a lot of hard work in therapy already. It isn't easy, and I am sure you made progress, so no way you are all the way back to square one. Sometimes we take two steps forward and one back, but hey that still nets out to a step in the right direction!

Best of luck with everything!!"
ptsd,fjhkbzr,t3_fdggpl,1583349791.0,"So proud of you! Therapy is not easy, but it really helps, so just by showing up you are doing a huge and difficult task! Keep it up!!!"
ptsd,fjhk396,t3_fdan8g,1583349658.0,"So sorry to hear you are struggling with nightmares, that is the worst. My nightmares were absolutely awful and my resulting insomnia was one of my worst symptoms because lack of sleep exacerbated everything else (not sleeping just really sucks is my point). Anyway, there is a super helpful well-studied treatment for exactly this! Have you heard of IRT? [https://www.verywellmind.com/imagery-rehearsal-therapy-2797304](https://www.verywellmind.com/imagery-rehearsal-therapy-2797304) You basically retrain your brain with a new ending for your flashbacks, and then when they come up in a dream, your brain sees the new (more positive) ending that you have trained it to see instead of the actual terrible flashback. I don't know if you have access to a therapist, but this treatment is hugely helpful and I highly recommend giving it a shot if you can! Sleep is so important. Best of luck, hope you get some relief soon!"
ptsd,fjhjha3,t3_fdahdg,1583349316.0,"It is totally possible you aren't in a place to do prolonged exposure just yet, and if it's really unbearable you can stop (definitely talk to your psychologist about this). But also just in case it's helpful, I went through prolonged exposure treatment, and after my trauma itself, PE is the hardest thing I have ever dealt with. My symptoms got worse before they got better (which is very common!), and I never wanted to do my homework. But for what it's worth, in the end it massively helped me heal and after completing the full 15 weeks, I no longer had clinically diagnosable PTSD, and was able to live my life again. So I am not saying it works for everyone, I am just trying to give you hope because it certainly can work in some cases."
ptsd,fjhicoe,t3_fdal7e,1583348687.0,"Hi,

I am so sorry to hear you feel this way, and yes absolutely I remember exactly this, I even wrote about it a lot and told my husband that I wanted to die because there was no point in living ""now that I am stuck like this."" But after 6 months of prolonged exposure therapy I got so much better, and my clinician and I even talked about the fact that believing you are 'stuck this way' is a classic symptom of PTSD, it's just really hard to see through it at the time. So know that what you are feeling is a totally normal and even expected symptom of PTSD, but that it isn't inherently true. You are not stuck that way, you can get better, I am living proof. And even though I will always be different than I was before the trauma, I have gotten back to a new kind of normal that feels good, and I no longer feel 'stuck' in PTSD.

I believe in you!!!"
