I'll share some quotes from my story that I wrote back in April:

""I usually get bored after a year once you've gotten too comfortable together, when you take each other for granted""

Her: ""If we still know each other (still in touch), would you like to come to my birthday party in July?""


Me: ""If we still know each other..?""

Her: ""Hehe, I'm just saying, I know how I work"" 

(Once the break up had materialized and I confronted her regarding this statement of hers, of course she said it was my fault, ""I said that because of how you used to be and still are."" which still makes me laugh a little to this day)

When we were talking about getting back together and meeting up in early 2019, I remember how weird of a thing I thought it was to say when she said: ""If you want to expose yourself to me again, then alright.""


""When I storm out of here, sometimes I need to be on my own to calm down, but don't stop following me, because I turn around every now and then to see if you'll go after me, I want you to since it shows that you care""

""I'm afraid to let myself be 100% happy. Whenever I allow myself to really be happy, some shit happens and ruins it.""

When someone ask me how to lose the weight, I tell them that eating what you normally would but smaller portion sizes, not eating at night and counting calories in addition to working out is, IMO, the way to go since it's a concept you are more likely to maintain compared to all kinds of diet powder or temporary solutions.
