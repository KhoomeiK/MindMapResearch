miraculousladybug,f71m3z0,t1_f71bdbc,1573343639.0,"This can be justified or rationalized however people want it to be, but I’m still going to consider it messed up at the end of the day. 

Second to last point: there’s a difference between coddling someone and deliberately trying to hurt them. I don’t believe good father’s do the second one. Where’s his best interest in? Definitely not his son, and I doubt his wife would agree with his methods. Is he doing this for himself all along?

First point: then why wait so long? They had a relationship for presumably weeks or even months before Gabriel decided to interfere and so if it was really about the disruption of adrigami, considering their partnership, wouldn’t Gabriel have intervened much earlier? 

Third point: Hakwmoth is the only present danger to Paris (other dangers are and have been handled by law enforcement). How could you be so certain his motives lie in Adrien’s safety? Besides throwing your son across the city, I’m sure getting him to release his miraculous could have been handled in much, much better ways. 
Also, didn’t you say he shouldn’t be coddled forever? Yet... letting him make his own decisions to fight crime isn’t an option? 

Fourth point: at least? What were his intentions, to akumatize chat or to let him know about his mother? He had so many months to do so before that moment.

Lastly, “good” intentions or not, what’s done was done. All the things I listed in my original were a result of Gabriel’s actions, which he had full control over, and all the damage that he had done, was done. Even if it was miraculously fixed in the end."

-broke him up with the love of his life

-came up with a plan to then akumatize Marinette 

-found out Chat noir was Adrien and still pursued his miraculous 

-suddenly revealed his comatose mother and traumatized him

-yeeted him across Paris into the Eiffel Tower after trying to beat him up

- made him cry and break down multiple times
