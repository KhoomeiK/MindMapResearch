AskReddit,fb08kvg,t3_eauhhu,1576423628.0,"2019 has been the worst year of my life. I was training for a half marathon when I noticed problems with my legs running. I ended up having two surgeries on my left leg and one on my right. Before my second left leg surgery, I got so bad that I couldn’t walk without a crutch. and even then I could only walk for ten minutes or so at a time. I’m a volunteer firefighter and haven’t been able to do that for almost a year. I’m in PT now and it’s very painful and seemingly never ending. This leg condition has taken so much away from me. 

I was miserable in my job because of a toxic environment and unrealistic expectations and the Monday after thanksgiving I got laid off after working thanksgiving and Black Friday when I was supposed to be off. Our revenue has been down and we didn’t have as much work so in some ways it wasn’t a surprise but it still sucks. 

I feel very much alone. I have friends but I’m always afraid of them turning away from me. I want to cut so badly."

Every since he had two open heart surgeries a few years ago, he is ALWAYS freezing and he HATES it. Always bundled in a robe with blankets. I got him a fleece lined robe with a hood. He always says he wants nothing but he is going to freaking love this. 

Also for my dad - he was a volunteer fire chief and my youngest brother finally joined a few months ago. So all four of his children are now volunteer firefighters. We took a picture of the four of us in gear and my mom is getting it framed for him. He’s going to really love that too :)"

AskReddit,f5z1poi,t3_dpp168,1572565293.0,"Compartment pressure test. I’ve had it done three times for chronic exertional compartment syndrome. Twice done for my left leg, once for my right. 

First you get numbed in four leg compartment. So four injections. Burns a little. 

Then you do the first round of testing. You don’t feel the needle (it’s a big son of a gun) but you feel the pressure which is highly uncomfortable. Four injections. 

Then you run to cause symptoms. You run until you literally can’t handle the pain anymore so that’s pleasant. 

Then you go back for the second round of testing, except now you also have the pain from running which is like the sharpest cramp it’s weird as shit. Again, pressure. 

And it bleeds a lot. And then the rest of the day you feel like a rock or something is in your leg in each spot and then they get itchy later. 

The third time I did the test, we had to do a couple extra readings because they thought they could get it higher. If I never have a pressure test done again it’ll be too soon."

The scar on my left leg is kind of neat because I had surgery there twice and the second time he just went through the original scar. Doesn’t look different. The scars are interesting in general because CECS made my life completely hell this past year - I haven’t worked out since January, about two months before my second surgery I started to have to use a crutch to get around and still couldn’t stand or walk for more than ten minutes at a time, and now I’m having to deal with the fact that my muscles are so weak from being unable to do anything.
