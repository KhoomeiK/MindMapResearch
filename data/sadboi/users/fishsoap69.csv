AskWomen,fpwod31,t3_gfq9ya,1588967009.0,"My first date I’ve ever been on was by far the best. It was last year in October with a guy I was iffy about cause I’ve heard some things about him. He took me to horror nights at universal studios. (Keep in mind I was scared to death to go) He’s a senior and I’m a junior but hasn’t had his license for a year yet so his mom drove us and I really bonded with her. She was so sweet and knew how to keep a convo going. He was open with his mom and didn’t act any differently around her like I do with my parents. 

We got there and took pictures in front of the famous universal sculpture. Within the first 20 steps he was already holding my hand. My heart melted. I held it tighter. We got to the first maze and talked so much while waiting in line. I learned a lot about him and him for me. Going through the maze I was freaking out and he squeezed my hand every now and then as reassurance. 

We cracked jokes throughout the night and eventually I wasn’t scared of the clowns, etc. We left at 1 am to go to CityWalk which was empty and at on the floor in the middle of everything and just talked.

On our way home his dad picked us up, and we showed each other memes and laughed so much. I got dropped off at home and I thanked him for a very fun night.

Those pictures that we took were posted on Instagram. I posted my very first date on Instagram."
