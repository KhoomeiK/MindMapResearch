snakes,forhy2i,t1_forg2ax,1588012537.0,"Thank you! Glad to know! Also, do you mean that it should only take an hour or so to completely thaw a frozen rat?! I always wait hours! Or do you mean thaw it in the fridge overnight before the other steps? I have been meaning to try the broth and braining. I have also found he is agitated lately and would like him to have eaten and then wait a couple of days after that before I clean his tank. He doesn’t have the greatest setup either. I will fix that when we are no longer in quarantine but he needs bigger hides and I may black out the sides. Also I’m glad I’m not the only one using lamps not tape or pads. I ofc have a pad but I don’t have it on currently by mistake."
bluetongueskinks,fordaaa,t1_foosy9q,1588010272.0,Thanks I’m happy to know that now! It also reconfirms that mine is a merauke. I obviously was pretty much 100% sure of this but still!
bluetongueskinks,foonbjt,t3_g8g968,1587942425.0,"Def not any Australian. Gotta be a really cool merauke, or something Indonesian for sure. I’ve definitely never heard of a merauke with those colors and I’ve seen skinks like that but idk what they were I can do a quick search and tell u 100% in a sec. that said high humidity is a must for that little guy."
funny,fmciset,t3_fe0cmk,1585946479.0,Guess what....that is my choir room!!!!!! Lol most of us didn’t know they took it till we literally saw the box and freaked out.
spiders,fkof0xd,t1_fkoewtc,1584385908.0,Yeah. I wish I had counted the eight legs before assuming it was some weird but and ending it’s harmless life. I honestly feel awful for it. :( I mean look how cute.

TrueCrime,fjuqls7,t1_fjuqg1m,1583619211.0,The victim should be a male though. But if I cannot find it I suppose I could make this work???? But I actually have similar backup cases with black male offenders and female victims already. Thanks though!!!! 👍🏻

OCPoetry,fh5wa6n,t1_fh5leef,1581292855.0,"Perhaps more on not just the feeling experienced through being trapped, but an elaboration upon why. When people are sentenced, there is a crime. What is the perceived crime? Yes, I know it could be that you went against society, but that also seems to be how you are being imprisoned. This could also be my own personal inaccuracy in my interpretation of the poem as a whole though."
OCPoetry,fh5vjt8,t1_fh5m2yg,1581292689.0,"Honestly, looking back I feel perhaps it is interesting that it almost rhymes yet doesn’t. It could even be considered its own metaphor. As someone who is not very consistent with rhyme schemes herself, I am trying to learn about whether or not hat is even all that important, or just something drilled into our minds in grade school."
OCPoetry,fh50cnz,t3_f1cbbg,1581283847.0,"This almost feels like an introductory poem to a series of poems. Not that this one ought to be lengthened, but perhaps a sequel is in order, to elaborate upon the idea. I also agree with the comment regarding capitalization."
OCPoetry,fh4zye2,t3_f193k6,1581283727.0,"Hmmm. I am in love with the overall piece, and am not sure if you ought to actually change anything, but, as others mentioned, am a bit curious about the intention of the rhyme scheme. It even seemed as though certain words were placed as though they rhymed but do not, technically, rhyme. Hope that made sense!"

Yes, it will suck, and you won't want to gain, but that is part of what you learn to be okay with through the treatment. I am a hypocrite but still."
BallPythons,fdemots,t3_ekkqv5,1578342262.0,Omg. I need to upgrade my baby asap after seeing this.
AnorexiaNervosa,fclyfqc,t3_ehqt8z,1577759542.0,"SO MUCH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I was in program with three guys with BED, and no one else at one point, and it was awful. Love them to death but god. They never binged around me but one of them had zero awareness and described in detail his binge combinations. We asked him to stop several times but he is actually late fifties or so and, not that that is old, but he is very forgetful. And, at Christmas, this one person I hardly, actually did not, know, ate four plates of food. This is not quite the same thing tho. But, in terms of thinner people eating 'normal' proportions, yes, definitely yes."
MadeOfStyrofoam,fcly5vy,t3_ehmhum,1577759347.0,"When the therapist said to use ice, they meant to avoid yeeting, not to help you do it!!! XD"
MadeOfStyrofoam,fcly49j,t3_ehmhum,1577759315.0,"hmm. See, if I am really in the moment, which I usually am, unless it is say the first time after a while clean, I do not feel it. I have zero pain tolerance, and, as of late have developed a distaste for all gore. Yet, yeeting, now that shit is nice. (I am actually abstaining rn but yeah lol)."
MadeOfStyrofoam,fcb3750,t1_fca2qfj,1577581722.0,Ohhhh...you were talking about urself at the end there. Sorry I am also a dumb bitch and have been eating 700cal/day and therefore had to reread this very straightforward comment several times before understanding it.
MadeOfStyrofoam,fc9x82v,t1_fc94nqv,1577559545.0,"Yeah but also you heal slower if u are restricting food because healing non-fatal/non-bleeding wounds is not your body's priority. I brushed it off when people told me that in the past but, now, 100% can confirm."
MadeOfStyrofoam,fc4s66t,t1_fc3p7gm,1577426419.0,"Cuz then people notice lmao. Also, the drugs and anorexia, I have found, do not mix well (well, not weed at least)."
MadeOfStyrofoam,fbfiftr,t3_ecy2nx,1576811373.0,Is it me who is not getting the message you are trying to portray or are all the other commenters just too sleep deprived to understand this is not about sleep deprivation?
AskDocs,fbc1nt7,t1_fb9mkik,1576713477.0,"OMG!!! I actually have frequent reynauds (my limbs, especially my fingers and toes, turn purple in cold and stuff!), and I am always cold. This make a lot of sense, because, as I said, I think this issue predates my ED, but I have been on the focalin since 5."

Check out my tumblr  [https://www.tumblr.com/blog/selfinjuryrecoveryispossible](https://www.tumblr.com/blog/selfinjuryrecoveryispossible)  too.

AskDocs,fb1xcww,t1_faxzmo4,1576442550.0,No I have not. I will research this now.
TooAfraidToAsk,fax1yo5,t3_eaomk5,1576377806.0,OMG I do not know if the whole emotion suppression part is why but I have poor mental health and yawn so much it is negatively impacting my daily lie. I even consider it a symptom when listing my physical panic attack symptoms. I also yawn while crying.
AskDocs,fawwuwg,t1_fawqkr5,1576376248.0,"I am definitely open to the idea of it being psychiatric, however, as someone who suffers from, has gone through many treatments for, and knows her specific symptoms of panic attacks, I know this is not one. I have had panic attacks caused by these episodes, once even filmed it, but not this time. I am not experiencing any quickened breathing, or feeling the need to do my breathing exercises that have become second nature. I am more dazed than when having a panic attack. Also, it seems to come on after waking up or otherwise without any stress building up first. I do suspect it is blood pressure related. I also completely see how it seems like a panic attack, I meant to specify it was not one in the original post actually. I have had multiple tests within the last six months, but never during an episode. My blood pressure was checked last month and was fine, but again, I was feeling fine."
