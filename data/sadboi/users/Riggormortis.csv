Along with that I opened a savings account to try and put some money away for a rainy day, my dad told me today that I'm putting too much money away in my savings account and I guess it was just the feeling that I did something wrong even though I was trying to do good that made me crash again. I've been trying to pick myself back up for most of the day."
