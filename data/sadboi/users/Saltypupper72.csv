I am relatively new to the field, four years as a mental health counselor, and have worked for a private, non-profit agency the entire time.  For many reasons, I am searching for a new job and interviewed yesterday at a psychiatric hospital.  I am familiar with crisis work and enjoy a fast paced and ever changing environment.  I am unfamiliar with group therapy and had only one class in grad school.  Most of the people I work with will be children and adolescents with the possibility of transitioning into working with adults, which is the ultimate goal.  Thank you in advance for all contributions.

You are clearly amazing at communicating through language. Keep advocating for yourself and reminding all the workers you come in contact with about the way you need to communicate.
