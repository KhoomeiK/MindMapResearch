SuicideBereavement,foxnub9,t1_fmnssit,1588150054.0,"Hello, I realize this is a late reply but reading your story sparked my interest. Firsty, I'd like to say I'm so sorry and my heart goes out to you. I can't imagine what you're going through. The reason I am commenting is because the way you describe your son actually makes it sound like he may have had a personality disorder called borderline personality disorder (or BPD for short). I am no psychiatrist and I can't diagnose anyone and you know your son more than anyone else but what you say about him actually points to the main symptoms of BPD. A major fear of abandonment (indicated by his reaction to his breakup), black and white thinking which is actually referred to as ""splitting"" with BPD, very impulsive decision making, and a victim mentality (indicated by his need for justice when people wronged him). I just thought maybe this is something you would like to look into possibly. If this offends or harms you in any way then I sincerely apologize and will happily remove my comment."

OCPoetry,foa7ngl,t3_g685vx,1587641595.0,The first stanza drew me in instantly. Maybe it's because I am currently going through a breakup but the last line of the first stanza had incredible shock value to me. Superb usage of metaphors and I love the way you depict life. I enjoyed this a lot!

SuicideWatch,fng4ep5,t3_g1gf9u,1586922061.0,"I am 21 and have been depressed since about 9 and suicidal since about 12 as well. When I was your age, the suicidal urges also hit me hard. I promise you that with time and effort things do get better though. You want to start over in life and you absolutely have that opportunity still. At your age, you have the ability to make your life whatever you want it to be. You need to make the effort though and I know that is hard and even terrifying at times but making changes is always scary. Don't overwhelm yourself. Take baby steps towards your new life. Set a list of goals for yourself and pursue them one at a time. Don't put a time limit on yourself. At your age, you have all the time in the world so don't rush yourself and don't take on too many tasks at once. Don't be afraid of failure and set backs. Every failure and mistake is an opportunity for you to learn and grow. You will experience failure and you will make mistakes and they will hurt but understand that you are only making yourself better over time. Take risks even if they scare you. You might try something 100 times and it might only work out for you once but you will remember the time you succeeded, not the times you failed or were rejected. Celebrate every goal you accomplish even if you are celebrating alone. If we can't find joy in our upcoming then we can't find joy in anything. Be your own biggest fan and supporter. Eventually, you will find someone else who will celebrate with you. Finally, you matter. You absolutely matter and you have such an incredible opportunity to be your age and understand you still have a chance. Take that chance. You can do this. You will do this."

Every season had an improved record. Now, let’s look at 2011 which was Hoke’s first year. In 2011, Hoke went 11-2 and then his other three years his record got worse every year. Obviously Hoke wasn’t good and not an 11-2 caliber coach but he was in 2011 because he inherited Rich Rod’s team that he built prior to Hoke taking over."

You are obviously very insecure with yourself and losing the weight will help with that. Women love confidence and you aren’t going to have any until you get past those insecurities. Losing weight is worth it regardless if it attracts women or not.
