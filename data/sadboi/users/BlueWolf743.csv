depression,fg9g55v,t1_fg9d83q,1580638432.0,"Understandable, I recommend getting another dog maybe. Either the same breed as your last one or just a completely new dog. And I see that's a big concern of yours.. Well perhaps only bring up the parts to the doctor that you feel is safe to bring up. Then they can help you still. I know you enjoy your job, but you should take some time off and say it's for ""health issues"" they'll understand, and you can spend a week or two to yourself with a new dog and some meds. Or if you really really don't want to take time off then just add the dog and meds on top of that and then you might be so busy that you don't have time to think about anything bad.. If you need to talk about the stuff you don't want to bring up to a doctor then my dms are open, feel free to vent to me etc. But if you don't that's fine."
depression,fg9f8jv,t3_exlve0,1580638055.0,"It's the same for me... I've always felt invisible and alone. But no matter how much you hate yourself, or wake up and glare at the monstrosity looking back at you in that mirror, you've got to be yourself and do what you're truly passionate about. That way, people with similar interests will pay attention to you and like you for you. Ignore everyone else and only do what makes you happy. If there are movies you like watching, then watch them and talk about them. Truly enjoy discussing them with people. I guess what I'm saying is you need to find yourself, and truly be the complex, unique human being that is you. You will fit in, I promise. Surround yourself with people who are similar to you."
depression,fg9ebp6,t3_exm3h8,1580637621.0,"It sounds like you've been through a lot.. I understand that you don't like openly discussing your feelings, however you could try talking to someone you work with about it, and see if any of them feel the same. There's a large chance that they do. Seeking help can be hard, I kept my problems a secret for about 3 years. But trust me, despite how hard it is to tell someone how you feel it is well worth it and will play in your favours. You can book a doctors appointment and then you don't have to worry about members of your family or your friends knowing and possibly judging you. But telling someone was the best thing I've ever done and I seriously recommend doing it. It's hard to do but once you have you can feel like the worst is over. Good luck, hope I helped"
depression,fg9d5sw,t3_exm3mo,1580637247.0,"Sometimes people can deal with their problems themself, most often they can't. There will almost always be someone with a darker story than you, but you've got to remember that no matter how stupid and irrelevant you think your problems are, if they're making you feel bad enough to feel and be classed as a problem then they are relevant and you deserve help just as much as anyone else. You should bring it up with a doctor and they should be able to help you. But I promise you, you are not being over dramatic. People crave extra attention when they feel like this. I know I do.. So get that attention you deserve. Because you do 100% deserve it! Oh and if you ever feel like hitting yourself in the head, my dms are open and we can discuss your feelings and emotions if you like.

Hope this helped"
depression,fg9c33v,t3_exm4ni,1580636796.0,"Depression can feel endless and so painful but it never lasts forever. Often to get rid of depression you must find strength inside yourself. If you can, cut yourself off from any form of alcohol for a while (my reason being drinking causes a dangerous cycle of emotions which often ends up making you worse) I recommend if you have the time getting a pet of some sourt like a cat or a dog. Something that will love you and keep you company in lonely times. Lastly seeking professional help. They can give you meds that will hopefully lift your mood just enough to be able to have the strength to help yourself. Bring it up with a doctor and they should be able to get you the help you need. I hope at least some of this helped you"

Also if she does ask you out youâ€™ve got to be honest and tell her youâ€™d rather be friends. It can be hard to break someoneâ€™s heart but Iâ€™ve found if anyone does ask you out and you reject them, the best thing to say is that you promise you wonâ€™t tell anyone and embarrass her.

I have to admit I kept trying but one day I met another boy. And all of my feelings for the other just began to fade. So it may be a while but just meeting someone else can really help you get over your last crush. Either that or just start convincing yourself that you like her as a friend and eventually youâ€™ll believe yourself.
