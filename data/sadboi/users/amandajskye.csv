I decide to leave my friends to go hang out with the guy. THEY LET ME. He is 21. He convinces me to go watch a movie at his house. Naive me thought that's what he meant. We go on the subway. I have no idea where we are or how to get back. We get to his place. We start making out which I was ok with. But then other things started happening that I was not ok with. I froze. Things happened. I eventually snapped out of it and we stopped. I told him I didnt want to do this. He understood. And took me back to my hotel. Thank god!!! But I was never the same after that. My friends never asked what happened.

productivity,fodk8xk,t3_g6s7x9,1587685731.0,"Fantastic essay! Thank you! 

I just wanna throw one thing in here if ya dont mind. One of the biggest issues reguarding my personal insomnia, was my anxiety about sleep.

 I was so concerned about falling asleep that my anxiety would keep me awake. I took my clock out of the bedroom ( so I would stop checking it and freaking out at the hours of lost sleep), total darkness, and I did my best to not be concerned about falling asleep. I would tell myself that even if I just lay here all night with no sleep, I'm still resting my body at least. 

If I lay there for more then 20ish mins, then I get out of bed and go to the living room to read untill I feel sleepy. 

It makes a big difference. 

Oh and brain dumping before bed too!! 

Sleep issues suck, so thanks for giving us some awesome advice! ‚úå"
