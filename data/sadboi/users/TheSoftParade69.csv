And I'm pretty short (5'7) and can maintain a slim body so I'm not defending height shaming. Most people just can't because modern society makes it nearly impossible. You inherent genes that control your thoughts, which control your eating habits and exercise habits. And most people will gain the weight back if they even do lose it- so fat people will allways be fat. If youre fat in your 20s or 30s it's going to be insanely hard to lose weight."
