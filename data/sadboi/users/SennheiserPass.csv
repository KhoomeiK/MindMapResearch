Two alternate strategies:

* **Strategy 1**: Download VLC portable, that is, the zip package option on their site. Since it won't be installed anywhere, its location will just be wherever you download it to, like the downloads folder. Maybe Windows will allow you to drag and drop files into this location even without Admin.
* **Strategy 2:** Request temporary Admin access for a work-related reason. When you get Admin permissions, do what you need with VLC.

Good luck. Also: if the keys file doesn't have the key for your specific disk, [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/VLC/comments/ee3q5r/how_do_i_use_libbluray_to_watch_blurays/fcj57c3?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) is another method, which involves using MakeMKV to decrypt it on the fly for VLC."

Things keep changing over the months / years, so perhaps not everything I say will still be current. Anyway, my experience was something like this:

VLC needs to decrypt the discs. To do that, it will need (1) some .dll libraries and (2) that keys file you mentioned which known keys for discs. For (1), I'm actually not sure which all are needed, but I followed this guy [here](https://forum.videolan.org/viewtopic.php?f=14&t=106570&start=120#p467308) and installed a now-defunct project AACS Updated because it contains the dlls you need (I think libaacs.dll and libbdplus.dll are the main ones but he mentions two more also). You will then place those in the same folder where VLC's .exe is. There are probably better ways to get the dlls now than what I did. For (2), you can get a more up-to-date version here [http://fvonline-db.bplaced.net/](http://fvonline-db.bplaced.net/). Place it like so: [pic](https://i.imgur.com/C5sZKYe.png). If your disc is inside the file, it'll play.

If your disc isn't in the key file, there is an entire OTHER rabbit hole right [here](https://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?t=172472). It's a project for getting the keys from discs and uploading them to a repository (that fvonline link just above).

* Also for discs with BD+ protection, there's yet more stuff to do, but I forget where to link you or what all I did, basically it was a weird mess but I was able to get a BD+ disc working. Just look into these threads and you'll find some discussion, maybe including a post where I myself explained how I got it working.
