depression,fbc4rp5,t1_fbamyhy,1576715645.0,"I felt like I wanted to die especially as a teenager.  With no one to talk to and family and friends in denial about the problems that I had I could go through a day distracted by work and play but it was at night in my bed that the feelings of deep heartache an dread would hit me hard and I would start cry alone for seemingly no reason. So yes, I wished and prayed for death at that time in my life. In short I can say that my life doesn‚Äôt make sense to me but death hasn‚Äôt caught up with me yet. So I live in gratitude for making it though a thousand + small bottoms I hit through my younger and adult years and try to learn something about self-care. I can only guess today that some Higher Power has a plan for me and the rest of the world that surrounds me. So I think I just stay alive in spite of myself and see if I don‚Äôt miss out on some good times! Because no matter how Deeply bad I‚Äôm feeling I try to remember that there is good things and love happening in the world and help is there if I want it bad enough. One day or one minute at at time I can handle what‚Äôs going on with me. Take Care my Peeps.‚òØÔ∏èüíüü§ìüòâ"
depression,fb9nxvu,t1_fb98psw,1576643898.0,Thanks it‚Äôs been very slow-mo - takes years to make progress for me. Then again I‚Äôm very hardheaded. lol.

depression,fb2mlnv,t3_eb1dy7,1576453793.0,If I can find it in me I Meditate every day at least twenty minutes twice a day and the answers I need for the day or maybe just the next right thing to do will come to me. I try not to give up. We are all too connected than ever before in history so i try to reach out we I feel like shit and there seem no end to it.
depression,f9eugkz,t3_e4k79x,1575251879.0,"Yup, I'm a older person and my adult siblings say (not even to my face) that I'm not trying. They are totally **unsupportive**. I cant count on most of my family members for support - They don't understand it and it seems to me that they are afraid of it because they might see some of the same issues I'm struggling with inside themselves. Introspection is hard. That is the one thing that I stay grateful for is self-awareness. If I can keep learning about myself and what I need to be healthy as I possible can at any given time I can make incremental improvements to my life. And that Is a full-time job in itself! One thing I found I have to do is find a hobby or activity that gets me excited and also learn something I didn't know before. **I wait for those sometimes far and in-between times of mental clarity and energy to focus on things I like to do for myself - seize that moment and build on it little by little.** I have struggled with **Anxiety, depression and PTS** for most of my life and just in the last few years stop beating myself up for not trying harder and being on the same level in life that other people in my life are at. I just take it one day at a time  and get outside in the sun if nothing else and try to enjoy nature, if I can get out of bed that is. lol.  I sleep allot. But if I take my meds at night and can sleep as much I as I need to when I need to, eat healthfully and get some exercise, I have more of those times of clear mental energy to get out of bed and get excited about something - anything!!!"
