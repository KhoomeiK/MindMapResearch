pcmasterrace,fn1xk93,t1_fn1u8i9,1586572541.0,"This is the thing. ‘Ages’ doesn’t truly demonstrate the legacy this connector has had. It’s been used since the 1950s. Just think about that:

It’s managed to outlast vinyl, magnetic tape, cassette, CDs, mp3s and has only been phased out late into the internet streaming era. And if you take the original 3 1/4” jack, that was designed in the mid 1800s. You can still use headphones from the *1950s* on your phone. 

Honestly, the removal of it just seems like a ‘because we can’ fever dream; and this is coming from a guy who likes Apple."
pcmasterrace,fn1a5v8,t1_fn14kgd,1586557848.0,"I agree with everything except for the headphone jack. 

Considering the quality, delay and general practicality of BT headphones, I think it misses the mark of what allowed the others to be phased out. It’s not superior in any regard to wired, except for the fact you don’t have a wire. I accept Bluetooth has a place (I use it for my bone conduction headphones for working out), but the fact it’s not even close in many regards is the reason why it’s forced implementation will continue to annoy me."

Instead of having the battery mounted with screws to a bracket in the case, they can use glue. Or instead of adding in a sodimm board, they can integrate it into the motherboard. 

I’m not defending the practice in of itself, just pointing out that it’s not without reason."

Nobody says he’s getting better, not even the government. He *may* be worse than they’re saying, but nobody knows outside his close circle and the nurses/doctors."
