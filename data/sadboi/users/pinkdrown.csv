My therapist worked with me during the span of one and a half year, and all we basically did on that front was to make a conscious effort to shake someone's hand when I met someone, eat one scary thing a day ( we kept that up untill I eventually ran out of scary foods.), and we I kept myself from washing my hands unless a dog licked them or if it was a bathroom situation.
