My partner and I own a music/production school and several years ago began working with an 11 year old non-verbal kiddo. The doctors had convinced his mother that he would never talk. They told her that his brain had ‚Äúthe verbal processing center that of a cat‚Äù. I was ducking appalled. Well, after teaching him some stop motion animation and working with puppets, the words began to flow. He is now nearly 15 and to the point that there is almost no speech impediment at all.

These kids were often treated like shit by school staff and parents. They were given the ‚ÄúBECAUSE I SAID SO!‚Äù reason for doing things, which is fucking TORTURE for an aspie! If someone can not articulate why it‚Äôs important, then often (this type of aspie) wont comply. Or will act in defiance as an indirect protest.

This is my fianc√©. He even jokingly replies with ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt tell me what to do!‚Äù When I say ‚ÄúI love you, be careful‚Äù when he leaves the house.

What I have learned from him may help you, but it may not.

If you need something done, begin by saying, ‚ÄúHoney, I need YOUR help‚Äù this may help him understand *WHY* he is needed. He may not understand that you can‚Äôt do certain things by yourself. (This is good advice for dealing with men in general) 

Then, always explain WHY you need something done.

My fianc√© kept leaving his size 14 boots in the middle of the floor. Talk about a tripping hazard!. Until I explained that tripping over them is dangerous to me, especially since I have a spinal cord injury and a minor stumble can lead to be being immobilized for days. That was when it clicked. He needs the REASON for why he has to do something.

Hopefully this helps a little. Good luck!!"
