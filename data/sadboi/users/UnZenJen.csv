I know that if I was either the black or white server, I would feel extremely let down by a corporation that should protect it's employees.

Drugs,f604nw1,t3_dpwv92,1572605139.0,"Back in my hayday, I used to hang with these cousins who all ran a legit, but not legal) operation. I became very close with them in time, not because of the drugs. They were just awesome. So to re-up, we had to drive from the Eastside of Detroit to the west side of Detroit. This is where the cousin and stash house was. Now, these guys did not fuck around and carried top of the line everything. They were extremely well connected. When we went to pick up, he had their stuff ready and always took me to the private office  to grab mine (I got a teener on them Everytime I went because I was the driver....clean record, drove well, new car and up to date everything, so it was a win win for all). He would open a hidden wall safe and pull out an entire brick. Not rerock. The kilo that just went from transportation moad to the house. From there he'd throw down a few baby bumps and wrap my stuff up. Now, this was not my first day at the rodeo. I was about 5 years into a daily habbit that was at least a teener to a ball a day. Now, those guys were not to be messed with, and I've seen beat downs left by them that were on the edge of taking the person out. But besides that, I learned a lot. I'm good with numbers and watched their money grow. I always paid attention. The cousin said to me one day 'You know why you get it off the brick and it isn't stepped on? I just kinda shrugged. He said ' Because you aren't dumb. You know where it comes from, that it's uncut when we get it and has a 96% purity reading. You listen. You start off small, with baby bumbs. When we sell it, we have to cut it (oh God, those were the baby laxative days) because people are dumb. They'll blow or IV  a quarter gram to half gram theirselves as soon as they get it, and then BAM, we are all fucked when they OD from stupidity.' Now, even cut, he sold a quality product, but from a business perspective it makes sense to cut your Coke. Even though he loved money, he was a smart guy with years of experience. And he knew that ODs would put too much heat on him. So yes, with high purity rates, your blow should have a cut (for the beginner or novice user). I'm easy with my bumps and lines because I know that I'm out if my mind high and once you start, you can only peak so high. But I remembered what those guys said, and it stuck. As I get older, I've been able to watch cocaine trickle back in the scene. I've seen stupid women snort an entire vial. I've watched people rail up 10 healthy lines and do them super fast. So in theory,I'm all for cutting coke to keep people safe (especially since I just saw a 13rd old partying a few weeks ago.) But I'm lucky that I don't try to Hoover an entire teener as soon as I get it. I'm also lucky that I got three guys who worry about my well being to a certain extent and trust my judgement. Because Coke is no joke. I learned that when I was 25 rushing my then 21 year old friend to the ER because she thought she was having a heartack. And when I saw her getting worked on by doctors to bring her back, I passed out in the triage room and got a hospital bed of my own for 2 days. Test your shit. Taste it, do a line before mainlining. Just be careful. Especially with Coke a and it's friend almost pure coke. ODs are awful, and they will call the cops for an OD (I know in Michigan they always do.) And remember, a dead user is money lost and can hurt business. Be safe y'all! Enjoy the slopes today."
sex,f5p9qd1,t3_domaxt,1572353545.0,"Run. This is not a man. He is a body shaming, selfish child. You deserve better. Sex is supposed to be fun and body positive (I'm a chubby girl myself, and I have no body issues in bed....it took awhile to get there, but the right partner is what seals the deal). First off, your grooming habits are not his concern. Everyone likes there lady bits to look a certain way. I was shamed into shaving it all off for years and was miserable, bumpy, and had to maintain everyday because my hair is heavy and dark. Then I met my now husband. He told me that it doesn't matter to him, he just wants me to be comfortable, and if he does want something he brings it up positively by saying things like 'hey, it would be so hot if you grew it all out for me if you wanted, or that he'd love to shave me into different styles....we have so much fun with playing around. 

Another thing your guy has no right to say anything about is a nick. Shaving our who-has is not always easy. You need a pretty sharp blade, which can cut easier, and in some areas we are going in blind and using our sense of touch. Unless he wants to help you, then he needs to get over it. Nicks happen.

But lastly, he has no care or concern for your time. You are not at his beck and call, and I'm sorry but there are a ton of guys that would be on time when pussy is on the table. You are worth so much more. And so is your pussy. This butthole does not deserve an ounce of your time.

I can say all these things to you, but I want you to know that I put up with dickwads like these for years until I reavulated my self worth. I love sex. I like to think I'm pretty damn good at it. And there is plenty of other good fish in the sea who will treat you like you deserve to be treated. If you stay, he will continue with this behavior, which will keep dragging down your self esteem, and eventually your libido. I just got so sick of bullshit that I started to resent sex. But with the help of a body positive, amazing man who appreciates all I have to offer, I'm having sex more then ever and I can't get enough. Good luck babe!"
addiction,f5mhoor,t3_doayjs,1572290018.0,"First of all, let me express my most sincere apologies. I lost my mother in January to Stage 4 lung cancer and advanced stage COPD. It's such a shitty way to go. If you ever need someone to talk to, please PM me. Coming from someone who used to have a huge habit a long time ago, it sounds like your dad is battling so much in his head and may have gotten a case of the 'fuck its'. It's hard to say if he has a habit, because sometimes you just don't know with Coke. But I do know that when the chips are down, and whether you are dependant or just a recreational user, your brain starts calling out to you that you should just do some blow. It's a twisted drug like that. It's a shame that he was kicked from that program for his use though, because with the new opiode laws in effect, that was the only time my mom was comfortable was after she signed her paperwork. Before that, she was lucky to get Tylenol 4 (she was on Dilaudid, but they cut that and pushed her back to codeine) and my mom had never abused a painkiller in her life. Her doctor knew this, apologized, and urged her to go into paelletive care just so he could get her comfortable to enjoy what time she had left. I hope your dad would be receptive to rehab, because some will work with him to get him the correct care he needs and get back on track. As someone else said, all you can do is just be there. It's hard, but he's going to make his own choices and go out his own way, which is selfish in a sense when you have family that needs you and wants to be there, but also not selfish because his days are numbered. It was hard watching my mom process the time frames they gave her. And she fought, and was winning, but finally she couldn't fight no more. She did it her way. So, express your thoughts to him, try rehab, and just be there. I wish there was a guide to life for some things."
EntitledBitch,f4piprn,t3_dl5a3y,1571732840.0,"Ugh. I can't stand people like this woman. We try to take our dogs at non-peak times because of entitled people and their children. We have two French Bulldogs. They love everybody and really love to socialize with other dogs (my 30lb boy, Tank, is best friends with an 120lb pit mix...they are so funny together). But they can get overly excited around kids and are not fond of being handled roughly. They won't bite, but I can see a change in personality when they are treated roughly. When I play roughly with them at home, they know it's a game and they put all the force they have into the play they give me back. I'm always explaining to kids that gentle is better, and when kids are around at the park, I am right by my dogs because I don't want anyone to get hurt. Frenchies are very strong and top heavy and even I have almost been knocked over. I used to love to take them to the dog friendly stores because they love going to pick out new toys, but I no longer do that because of an altercation I had between a woman and her child. The child appeared out of nowhere and wanted to pet the puppies. I told her that as long as her mom was present then she could. So, she runs off and brings back this pissy woman that is acting like I ruined her day. So I tell the little one to let them sniff her hands and then gently pet them. Well, Frenchies have smashed faces so they make 'grunty' noices. So, the child hears this and starts screaming that the are growling at her. I explain to the mother that they are not growling, they are just breathing through their mouths and noses and it sounds like deep grunts. So the child starts patting them really hard and she grabs at Tanks nubby tail, and he didn't like that, so he turns around to jump at her. The lady went apeshit, saying my dogs are aggressive and they shouldn't be in a public store and blah blah blah. I told her that it isn't the animal, and that she should be more gentle and yanking at any dogs tail will cause a response. So as she is still stammering out some Bullshit, I turn around and leave. That's why I wanted the parent there in the first place. You never know what can happen. My dogs won't bite, but they do jump up when excited and they associate rough petting as play time. So I have not taken them back in awhile...so sad. They still get lots of love from my whole neighborhood who all love them and the kids around here already know how to approach the dogs. Parents need to explain to their children that not all puppies are friendly...some are service animals and working dogs, I know a few police K-9s in the area, and some animals are protectors for their owners. They all have instincts and will show some aggressive traits when threatened. Sorry about the rant. Hearing stuff like this just grinds my gears. Pets are not toys and dog park rules should be followed for the safety of all that are there."

I work in the service industry and I tip my local pizza guy $20 to bring my food a half mile to my house. But if you do go a gratuity route for large orders, stick to it. You might lose an order or 2. And that sucks. But it's freaking 2019 and everyone should know by now that drivers have to pay for their own insurance, gas, and vehicle maintenance on top of supporting their families. If these cheapskates really don't want to cough up the extra dough (lol, get it...cheesy, I know!) Then let them know that pickup is available and you'll help them load it in their cars. Pizza delivery drivers are angels sent down from the heavens. They brave the elements so I can sit in my pajamas and watch TV after my own long ass bartending job. They deserve better."

Do you share a checking or savings account or does he give you money? If yes, start squirreling it away. Start looking for work....maybe something close so you can walk or take the bus. Do not stay with this person in the long run...value yourself and your worth. Start looking into a rent a room situation (sharing a house with roommates). Idk where you're at, but up here in Michigan my friend was in a similar situation and she was able to rent a room in a bomb ass house for $300 a month (all utilities included).

We have an arrangement where I do go back to shaving from June-Mid September just because of summer, but otherwise, it's made our sex life so much more fun. Now, it's not out of control crazy, I do do some maintenance, but it's hot to know that he appreciates me the way I am and not how everyone expects me to be.

sex,f2a3bho,t1_f29nt86,1570107990.0,"Yes! I love your comment! I can totally relate because I waited until I was 35 to get married. I had been engaged twice before in my 20's and after taking off the love blinders and actually comparing our compatibility with open eyes, and sitting down and discussing our wants, needs, and desires before we started to plan our wedding, I learned that we were not going to be happy down the road. The breakups were tough as I had 3.5-5 years invested in those relationships, but as I look at my life and my husband now, I am so thankful that I waited. As I grew, I knew what I wanted from life, and one of the biggest things was that I did not want kids. My ex fiance's all did, and they pressured me so much to change my mind. But I knew it never would. These were also the same guys who told me that if I did get pregnant, and even though they knew I'd never cheat, that they'd still want a paternity test done (wtf!). They also couldn't handle a 5 minute sex conversation, and felt that their needs were always number 1. After them, I met some great and interesting men, but when the tough questions came out, they lost interest. It's as if I was a doll on a shelf that should only be interacted with when it's good for them. The day I met my husband was probably the most incredible day of my life. I knew after a week that we'd be together for the rest of our lives. We speak very openly about everything and we both have HLs. I'm also lucky that he had had a vasectomy so neither of us wanted kids. We met over 5 years ago, and got married 2 years ago. We discuss everything....he truly is my best friend. But most of all, we have an active healthy sex life. We listen to each other, try new things, and always make time. I know that men and women aren't always on the same wavelength, but there are things that can help. A check up by the doctor, opening up to one another, and being honest are a few good steps. I know as a woman that we have our needs and men have theirs. And I'm a realist. I know that if I don't show my partner affection, there are other women who will. My husband is not a cheat, but he's not dead either and he's a 40yr old good looking guy that's smart, funny, and extremely successful. And he treats me like a damn princess. I adore him, and I love being able to have fun and make him happy. But if you don't feel this way about your SO, then it's time to part ways. For your mental well being and for the spouses as well. We all need and crave affection. Love is hard. Marriage is easy (I know, it's not really, but we can all go through the steps of a marriage everyday....love comes from within. If there is no love there, then it's time to be honest and let go and find happiness.) We should want to enjoy time with our spouses. When anger and resentment and loss of attraction appear, it's done. Be honest with your partner. And listen to them as well. Love and Marriage is a game of give and take. But it only works when both people are giving an equal balance of both. Sorry about my babbling."

I've been a bartender for 25 years, and one thing I know about the industry is that it's a quick way to make money. Right now may be slow, but as far as hiring, a lot of places use this down time to hire in people to 1) cover open positions do to people going back to school and 2) To start staffing up for when the busy season starts up again. Now, I'm not just talking about bartending, but most places need servers, hosts, food runners, bussers, To go people, delivery drivers, dishwashers, prep cooks or line cooks. A lot of these positions are tip based or have a mixed hourly wage/tips setup. It's just a thought. But there is money to be had for go getters and people who hustle. Good luck!"

But your back story just gives every one of your other posts so much more power. I love that you take no shit.....because you remind me of myself. We all have stories, but ours parallel in a lot of ways. I did not come from money. I was always being made fun of, whether it be for my clothes, or my house, or my dad's 79' Lincoln Continental that had an 8 track (that was the car I learned to drive in in 1996. Imagine being 15 and having to learn how to parallel park in that fucker. I couldn't see over the damn steering wheel). But when the shit hit the bricks, my sister (black belt in Karate) taught me how to take care of myself. Kids sucked. Still do.

sex,f0qwvp3,t3_d5x5jr,1568868312.0,"Just be honest. Sit him down and let him know that you love him, and enjoy your sex life, but let him know that you feel like you're both holding back a little. Tell him that you want to know what makes him 'tick', and that there is absolutely no judgement. Start out by saying 'If there is anything that you'd like to do that we haven't, I'd love to hear about that.' If you notice him feeling a little hesitant, then take the floor for a moment and mention some things that you've been envisioning. But also take time to play up the things that you already enjoy doing with him. You don't want to make him feel like you don't enjoy getting down and dirty with him. Use encouraging conversation like 'I absolutely love when we do (whatever sex act here), but I think it's be even more awesome if we added (another sex act) to it. Bring up porn...ask him what he's into, and share what you like. Then take a day to watch each kind together (but on seperate days). Let him know what looks appealing to you in what he watches and tell him about why you like what you like. These conversations can be fun and hot. My husband and I have always had a great sex life, and over time we really started opening up to each other about what we want. Things that I didn't really think about in the begining of our relationship are all out on the table now, like me wanting to watch him fuck another girl, and how he wants me to dress so he can tear it all off of me.....and so much more that I don't wanna share with the world. Just communicate. What's it going to hurt? And if he's that uncomfortable, then maybe it's time to switch things up a little. Life is too short for bad sex. Our libidos go up with age (I'm 38 now, and think about sex about 99% of the day) so you will be kicking yourself down the road for not having better sex. Good luck babe!"

But I have a friend who is schizophrenic and between the correct prescription cocktail and the therapist he goes to, he lives a very rich and fulfilling life. When I first met him 20 years ago, he was a mess and would go on and off his meds. All of his friends stepped in and did an intervention. He went from being on social security disability, practically homeless, and giving up on life to finishing school, becoming a director at a local University, and helping others with mental illness in his spare time. I'm definitely not saying that his case is the norm, but there is hope out there. Plus, all of his friends never gave up on him. When you ask about his life now, the one thing he says is that he will never stop taking his meds and will always continue with some type of therapy.

You can get some hella good deals online, but my husband and I decided to go to Hawaii 3 years ago and we decided to use a travel agent so we wouldn't forget to book anything. We had a couple of friends who decided to go to Hawaii as well, but used discount internet sites. Not only did our travel agent get us a great flight at a discounted price, but she also booked us at the best rated hotel in Waikiki, managed to get us vouchers for free breakfast everyday (this hotel charged $40 a person for breakfast, but their buffet was out of this world), and got almost everything we wanted to do discounted for us (we were going mainly to snorkel and take a 'swim with sea turtles' tour). The only things we paid full price for were our dinners out and any souvenirs. Now, our friends paid more for their flight, which had layovers (we flew straight to Seattle from Detroit before flying to Hawaii on Delta) and was not with Delta, their hotel was nice, but was not on the beach (we stayed at the Royal Hawaiian, which is a beachfront property with their own private beach and is an absolutely amazing property), they had to cover all food costs (we had our free breakfast vouchers, which included a meal so large we didn't have to eat again til dinner), and they also paid full price for any of the tours they did. All in all, their trip was almost $1000 more than ours for the same length of time. Now, up until then I'd never used a travel agent, but for a vacation like that, I will never book without one from now on. We all still had a great time, but our trip was just so much easier, cheaper, and our amenities were nicer. I'll leave the discount sites for when I fly out for a last minute weekend or to go visit someone."

REDDITORSINRECOVERY,ez8s1r5,t3_d06mun,1567756344.0,"Please take your medication. You are prescribed it for a reason. I know that it may not feel like it to you, but you are absolutely in recovery. You are not abusing your meds or buying them off the street. Please do not beat yourself up because you need these medications to function. NA and AA can be so temperamental when it comes to prescribed medications. I have been to meetings where they do not consider you to be clean even if your meds are prescribed and you do not abuse them and I have also been to meetings that are totally on the opposite side of the spectrum where you are considered to be clean as long as you are prescribed your meds. If you absolutely wish to go to meetings, you may have to shop around to find one that is more open minded. I actually found group meetings that were not AA/NA but we're still addiction focused and had more liberal views regarding medication (I am prescribed a very low dose of Xanax to control my anxiety attacks. I do not abuse this medication and take it as prescribed as needed). Those meetings are a little harder to find but when I became discouraged with AA/NA I kept looking and found one. But while you make these decisions, please don't dwell on the fact that you aren't sober, because honestly, you are. I'm sure if you had a choice you wouldn't be taking any meds, but sometimes that's not how the cookie crumbles. Take your meds to function and take time to find a group that will accept you. They are out there. Don't let other addicts at NA/AA tell you how to work your recovery. Everyone and every case is different. Good luck!"

When I met up with my now husband for our first date, I chose a cute coffee house in a nice town that had a beautiful and large downtown with unique shops and lots to see. We walked and talked and drank coffee for 3 hours. It was the best first date ever. Women that demand expensive dinners on the first date give the rest of us a bad name. I love finding inexpensive fun things to do for dates (my husband and I still go on dates often). We are very comfortable financially, but both of us don't like a bunch of flash. We usually treat ourselves to an amazing meal about once a month, and when we do it's usually someplace like Fleming's. It's pricey but so worth it.

I've had the same thing happen to me when I stayed at a kinda sketchy hotel with a guy I had been dating that I met online. He chose the place, and one night I left his company and headed down to the vending machines. This hotel had a setup where the rooms were accessed from the outside, and it was only one level, so you could go out of your room and see all of the other rooms, where people were parked, and who was partying. I was walking back to our room when I passed by another room with a few younger guys hanging out outside smoking. As I passed, one of the guys said 'Hey, is that guy your Boyfriend?' I just kinda smiled and said maybe. Then he proceeds to say 'How much for the three of us?' I just stopped in my tracks and said that I wasn't a pro and that he was mistaken. He just laughed and said 'Ok, sure.' I didn't feel threatened, but I didn't go back outside by myself at all. I'm glad that NY was a stand up guy when that crap started happening.

But even though you are sober, your brain has still been repairing itself over time because of the damage the drugs did to it. I'm 9 years clean, and those first 4 years were tough because I had 10 years of hardcore stimulant and opiate abuse under my belt, so my dopamine and serotonin levels were low, and my body had been pretty wrecked as well. Eventually after discussing things with my doctor who knows about all my usage and is pretty well versed on addiction, she suggested that I might need an antidepressant. I'm prescribed Zoloft, which helped immensely with my depression and anxiety. A couple of months later I felt renewed. I'm not saying that antidepressants are right for everyone, but they did help, and so did time. It still took a couple more months to get it together and for me to kick the junky mentality and to start realizing my self worth. Now my past feels like a bad dream because my life is so different, and I'm proud of myself for what I have accomplished. But I took the time to celebrate my small accomplishments with myself, and you should be too. First accomplishment....you got sober. The second? You fought and got your kids and life back. Many addicts do not make it this far so this is a HUGE accomplishment. Third...you are still clean after all this time. Please take the time to acknowledge all the good things you have done and also take time to evaluate your self worth. Things will get better...day by day, month by month, year by year. But when you notice the bad feelings rushing in, step back and look at your life now, and think about all the good things. The old you is gone....she no longer exists.

There'd be eyeshadow everywhere, foundation on everything (or ripped off the display and stolen), people drawing on the display with eyeliners and lip pencils, and every color nail polish used to paint the display and not the little paper section they gave you to test them out on.

We were on the bike trails and right when we were rounding a big curve, this guy appeared out of nowhere, holding his huge purple dick in his hand with his pants around his ankles. He must have been around 50 and was standing right in the middle of the trail. He's glaring at us and is friviously jacking off, and we are super shocked but rode our bikes off the path and into the woods on a side trail. We left as soon as we hit a paved trail again.

We never saw him again (thank God) but when I think back to that time all I can wonder is why the hell was he jacking off in the woods? It was pretty early in the a.m. and there wasn't anyone there really besides some kids at the Basketball court across the park. Was he waiting for someone to see him, or was he just fapping to the majestic beauty of the forest...lol...we'll never know. But one thing I'll never forget was how big and purple his shit was.

Methadone,evs192j,t1_evrpjom,1564725673.0,"OMG! It was like reading my own story, but I've only had 4 counselors. I was at 130 and now I'm down to 31, been clean since September of 2009. After my last counselor (and my absolute favorite) left, I knew it was time. I had already been detoxing because she motivated me to get on with my life. My new counselor is nice enough, but I am truly sick of sharing my past with people because that is no longer the person I am. I don't want to relive it. It is a part of me, I know that, but I have fought so hard to change everything and I'm so happy. When I think back to ten years ago, it's almost like a bad dream. I'm not even nervous about coming off. Instead I feel excited when I think about it. I actually have to remind myself to keep going slow and steady because I am truly ready to be done. My goal is to be finished my January. Good luck on your taper as well. Here's to the next ten years!"
Methadone,evol9tt,t3_cklbue,1564649670.0,"You are in withdrawal. The naloxone is ripping the Methadone off of your opioid receptors. Your doctor should have taken you down to about 20mgs (that's what my clinic does), have you jump off, and then start the Subs when you are actually in withdrawal from the Methadone (about 3 to 4 days). You need to go back and discuss this with your doctor, stat. I'm sorry you're going through this, but it won't get much better until it's done the right way. Is there any particular reason why you (not the clinic) wanted to switch? I'm detoxing off my Methadone, and I'm at 30mgs....I was up to 130 at my highest. As of now, I've had no symptoms. I know it's different for everyone. I'm just curious about the switch. I've known people that have been on both and detoxed from both, and some people have said that the Subs are harder to get off of. Once again, I know everyone is different. I really hope you can get this all fixed ASAP."

These aren't some basic earrings that just had an extra pop up. This is kinda awesome, and also kinda bizarre. I really want to know where the third one came from! Thanks for sharing!"

addiction,evblbp6,t3_cj6pcc,1564382118.0,"Take all the money you would have spent on your nicotine needs and put it away in a separate spot. Do this everyday as if you are going to the store. In a month or two, take that cash and put it towards something you really want. That's what my husband and I are doing with the money we spend on smoking. We are taking a small trip. The excitement from that has stopped me from wanting to smoke. It has also shown me how ridiculous our habits have gotten because we are able to go out of town with the amount of money we used to spend in two months smoking (our room, gas money, food money, everything is covered with this fund). I wish you the best. It's so hard. But it'll be so worth it for you. You're a bit younger then me, so your body should bounce back quicker. Good luck!"
TalesFromThePizzaGuy,ev72tp5,t1_ev5g24a,1564254531.0,"Suburb of Detroit. They've been giving us that option for about 2 years now. I can get 10s, 20s and 100s from my banks ATM."
Methadone,ev4uve7,t1_ev4u5k1,1564221931.0,"Right!!? I couldn't believe how much money I spent trying to alleviate the problem when the best solution was the cheapest. It is a little bit of work, but God damn that relief was incredible."
TalesFromThePizzaGuy,ev4tc7j,t1_ev3tehh,1564221018.0,"Ugh...I feel your pain. Im a bartender at a brewery and I had three different people tonight order one beer for $6.36 and all three cashed out using a $100 bill. Then they get their panties all in a wad when I tell them it's going to be a minute because I have to make change for them (we cash their checks out from our own personal bank that we carry on us because we don't have a cash register....It would be impossible to have 8 bartenders running drawers in that place). Now our manager has a drawer and is super quick to get us change, and we try to be quick as well, but it's a very busy brewery. It always seems like these guys will nurse one beer for two hours but all of a sudden they're in a hurry to leave when you're cashing them out. All I think to myself is that if you know you are going to go out and stop to grab one beer, why don't you bring smaller bills? ATMs give you an option on what denomination you wanna pull out. Get out some $20s or $10s or break it earlier in the day. Hell, I'd be happy if they paid in change instead because that $100 bill is going to slow down almost any transaction."
Botchedsurgeries,ev4nytd,t1_ev2w6vb,1564217808.0,"OMG! Best comment I've seen in weeks. Thank you for one hell of a laugh! If I had gold to give you, I would."
talesfromcallcenters,ev4ign7,t3_ciaetc,1564214523.0,"My dad is 76 and has a flip style cell phone (no frills please, he says), and my sister and I have taught him that if my name or hers isn't the number that pops up, then it's most likely a scam (he has 4 numbers saved). We told him not to answer. Instead now, he does the opposite. He answers and tells them to 'go to hell', 'fuck off', or whatever other phrase he's using for the day. We should have known that with his personality (Hardcore Vietnam Vet, Total badass in his day) that he'd put his own unique 'spin' on things. God, I love that man."
Methadone,ev4gg9n,t3_cicqly,1564213460.0,"Ok, this is going to sound gross, but if this doesn't work, try an enema. Like old school enema. That is what my doctor told me to do when it got so bad once and nothing worked. After that I stuck with lots of water, fiber, and dulcolax. But that first time I almost cried because I was so god damn happy that I could go. And comfortably too. No cramping....but it does make you feel 'full'."
LetsNotMeet,ev4fiw8,t1_ev30gm9,1564213007.0,"I'm sorry it took so long to respond. He said Mumbai. But it was also ten years ago, so maybe things were different?"
LetsNotMeet,euje18y,t3_cgjq1z,1563869037.0,"OMG! I'm so happy that you and your dad survived this experience. And what a creep this guy was for taking advantage of an already vulnerable girl. It makes me sick. My husband had to go to India about 10 years ago for his last job and train other engineers on how to do his job. When he arrived with a couple of other coworkers, they were surrounded by cops or armed guards with AK's at all times for the entire trip. My husband was speaking with one of the cops about the fact that they had drivers that carried weapons everywhere they went, and that if he wanted to go anywhere, he had an armed guard at all times. He then asked if it was really necessary and was India really that dangerous and the cop told him 'Yes, for American tourists it is. There are a high amount of kidnappings, sexual assaults, and robberies that happen to American tourists, and all of this was for their protection because India is very afraid of losing Tourism money from the US. My husband was just a specialized tech guy and didn't handle money or anything important. He really liked going there and said he met some of the nicest people ever, but just having to deal with armed guards and the thought of how dangerous the cop told him it was has deterred him from ever wanting to return. Scary."
