He told me to stand up and walk. I did. It hurt but I was able to walk. He told me “if you can walk, nothing is broken”.

AmItheAsshole,fdw2w91,t3_en0zfr,1578754505.0,"NTA . Texting while driving is extremely dangerous. I’ve been in a couple of car accidents and each time has been a result of distracted driving. 
1. Someone ran a red light on accident and T-boned me, 
2. Someone “missed” their turn so they made a long right and hit my head on.
3. I was talking to my wife and pulled out into a busy street, only to lose my bumper. Other driver was safe. Thankfully.

If you’re texting, you’re relying on everyone else around you to react to your presence, because you’re not going to do what they expect. With everyone else also texting, their reaction time won’t be fast enough. I don’t like those odds.

Your partner is just plain wrong - texting is not acceptable. If everyone jumped off a bridge, would she do that too?

However, I don’t think your actions will help your daughter understand it’s not ok. Your partner is telling her it’s fine and turning this into a “Her v You” versus a lesson for your child.

It’s too late to change what you’ve done, but I think there’s a path moving forward. The DMV offers driver retraining courses for about a hundred bucks. You should go to one of these meetings with your daughter. Make it a bonding experience - show her the kinds of people that make these mistakes. I guarantee there will be another young girl there.

The video catalog includes (at least in my state) a video about accidentally killing someone else. It also featured a film about how long it takes for an accident to happen. (About 2 to 4 seconds - less than the time it takes to send a text)

Your daughter, hopefully, is a rational person you can communicate with honestly. She’ll see an authority figure other than you reinforcing this opinion, so it’s not just you v your partner.

Also, it’s real easy to punish someone when you don’t also feel it’s effects. When I was 16, my
Car was my whole life. I got my permit immediately. Taking her freedom for something she see as a non-issue is bad. Make her see WHY it’s so important and maybe she won’t blame you so much.

So; that being said, here’s what you should change.

1. Remove the “objective” line. Employers want their objective to be your objective, don’t give them any reason to think your goals might not align.

2. Go look at the job postings for the job you want. Find the keywords and insert those keywords into your resume.

3. Your education section should be first. Then your experience. 

4. Do not label yourself a “volunteer” because volunteers typically aren’t a paid position. If you weren’t paid for it, there’s less accountability.

5. Add a few more projects, even if to you they were more like”dabbles”. The more different things you can do, the less the company will feel like they’re hiring a one trick pony.

Interview tips:
1. Be confident. You ARE the right person for the job. 

2. Know how much the average person makes in the job you are applying for. That’s your ask.

3. You’re right out of college. If you paid for college yourself, that’s something to be proud of. If you are the first of your family to go to college, that’s something to be proud of. Give the hiring manager a reason to feel like a savior, because right now, you can’t play the “I’m amazing and perfect” card, you don’t have the experience to back it up. Be confident and proud, but yielding.

4. If they ask you where you would want to be in 5 years, the correct answer is one promotion up from the job you are applying for- you’re a quick learner and want to be a part of their organization.

I hope this helps. Good luck."

Also, the question was about relationships, not Canadian Thanksgiving. Way to stay off-topic and pollute my funny podcast with irrelevant facts. If I wanted to learn something, I would listen to NPR. This is MBMBAM.

Edit 1:
Not being sarcastic. Humor is subjective. He was not funny.

Edit 2:
Every other guestpert plays along with “having already heard the question”. Hodgman got all whiny about it. If that’s funny to you, ok, but it’s not the usual around here.

Edit 3: Way to downvote me for having an opinion. I’m sure you’re fun at parties."

Your best bet is to look back on this campaign as a learning experience and examine what quests your players really enjoyed. Then, relax for a while. Read some books, listen to some podcasts, and when a new setting idea comes to you, start writing.  


Tell your players what you've cooked up and try to restart with the same rules you began with; but this time knowing a whole lot more about what your strengths are. Play to them :)"

If this happens again, a good back up plan is to come into the interview with a “click-bait” answer.

“I know you want to reduce your carbon footprint, but you’re a business too. Let me tell you how to help the environment and save money while you do it”

There is a real reason behind why you think it’s inappropriate to ask her family for money; you want to be independent or your pride won’t allow it or some such. To her though, when you need something, you ask your family for help and they will provide.

By dismissing the situation rather than addressing it or explaining it, all you’re doing is ensuring an understanding can’t be reached. I’d be surprised if this relationship lasts, especially if you continue to dismiss arguments because her thoughts are “unrealistic” to you. Your rationale is equally unrealistic to her."

A monarchy is a form of government that is only as good as the person who leads it. A benevolent leader can do a lot of good for a lot of people. A cruel leader can do a lot of harm.

I think that while a Monarchy won’t consider a certain number of peoples point of views, it can force certain policies onto the masses.

If I had a monarchy, I would focus on:
1. Human Rights
2. Healthcare
3. Science"

If there really isn’t another route, and you don’t want to run at a different time, the best thing you can do is not tell anyone. Technically, you are inconveniencing others because it’s more convenient for you, which does make you an asshole.

So if you want to keep doing it; don’t get involved in the drama. Don’t comment on social media, don’t tell people what you’re doing and explain your reasons, etc.... 

If you don’t give the complainers a target, this will go away a lot faster."

The fact is, most people spend so much time in their own heads that they’re rarely thinking about you.

My advice to you is to ‘Fake it until you Make it’. You might not know how to do a lot of things, but that was just one stage of your life. Now that you’re not so limited, try doing things and don’t be afraid or embarrassed of fucking up. That doesn’t mean do stuff thoughtlessly, just that no one is stopping you from trying."

The new characters must relate to the old ones, and can profit off if & interact with the prior iteration of themselves. They are younger and will get quest prompts based on useful information provided by the elder adventurers.

If you continue this cycle, you will end up with each player having an organization of resources to employ. That seems like it might appeal to this particular group."
