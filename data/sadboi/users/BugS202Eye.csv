buildapc,fqt4x9d,t3_gk5k1j,1589630089.0,"I can say that parts vary in price for different reasons but human greed dont have any reason that is the usual chaotic nature we are born with lol 

But still i wouldnt sell mine for small ammount just because i bought expensive mobo ram PSU and GPU so they can hold 7-10years

Example rtx2080super range from ~850euros ""msi super gaming trio"" all the way up to ~1300 euros for ""asus Rog Strix gaming white""

P.s. watercooled cost only 50 euros more than white

P.p.s.humans never use things the way they are intended and SCAMMING counts as murder just because people die inside when realizing they got scammed... Dat dead look in the eyes thoughðŸ‘½"

But good people is afraid to stand Up to greedy manipulative destroying race called humans. The thing is we aren't appriciating others and thinking about ourselfs but life is about living and not rotting away because of greedy disgusting politicians and brainwashed retards that step on everything and everyone.
Just hold on to things you like and i hope they will help you to move on. 
Im ashamed to be a human and i'm useless but i try so much and it pointless anyway with the things Country called Earth is, were and will be....

Hang in there you are still young. 

Love to all and dont forget to treat others same way you want to be treated (don't step over heads) you need to be carefull sometimes and other time you might find a gem of person.

You are all awesome! Love to you all.
