I'm sure it feels much nicer to cry about unfairness of the process than acknowledge the simple truth that we could have overcome all of that by voting. Voting is the least we can do.

Are you seriously trying to say that as many as 70% of democratic voters age 18-45 all had their vote suppressed? 

Did that many people have six or more hour wait times? 

Yes, by all means, call out voter suppression, just don't act like that's what cost us Super Tuesday. It was apathy. How many places had more than 20 minute waits, seriously? There were places like Houston, but those were the exception. If we had bothered to show the fuck up for each other, we would have a decisive victory to feel good about. 

It feels much nicer to say that we got fucked over by the system, but the reality is that we fucked ourselves over. There's *no one* in politics right now like Bernie Sanders. No one with his record. This is his last shot, and it's frustrating to see people pointing fingers at external things that could be overcome with the simple act of voting that we've been begging people to do from the very start.

All we had to do was show up. 

Because we already *knew* about the voter suppression efforts, we already *knew* the establishment would unite against us. That's *why* it was so important to vote. Literally the only weapon we actually have to tear down the system, and people couldn't be bothered to use it.
