It needs time to recover too. Eat healthy, exercise, drink plenty of water, get some rest when you can and enjoy the time with your baby. They are only little for a short time. The weight will come off but this time you have with your baby cannot be replaced. Stressing about losing the baby weight is just making it more difficult to lose the weight.

dogs,fqifvcd,t3_gj4jwd,1589395445.0,"That was our plan for our boy. Unfortunately, our plan went out the window. He developed a pulmonary embolism and needed emergency treatment ASAP. Once we got to the vet (our regular vet and dear friend) she said we could potentially risk surgery but we would need to get him to a specialist NOW but her professional opinion was he would not make it through surgery and most likely would suffocate to death before we could get him there (we had to take him an hour away depending on traffic it could be 2 hours). We made the painful decision to euthanize humanely inside the vet clinic. 

Our boy was at the vet 2 times a week for injections for months. It was his second home and he loved everyone in the clinic and they loved him. Employees found out quickly and techs were coming in on their day off to say goodbye to him and support us. Our vet was amazing, low lighting, quiet music, it was very much set up like a room for a massage. We held him on the floors d hugged him through it. He was oddly calm even before the sedative. He was ready to go and I could see it. He licked my tears to tell me it was ok and we let him go. I told him how much I loved him, how my biggest regret with him was I couldn’t rescue him sooner (he was 8 when I got him) and when the time was right I would rescue another English bulldog to honor him. I punched a brick wall when we left without him and broke my hand.  I was so angry. 

A few months later I got a call about an English bulldog on the TN/GA line being euthanized if someone didn’t come get him immediately. He was 3. I jumped in my car and raced the 4 hours to get him. I brought him home that night on the premise of I was going to foster him until a foster family had an opening. That failed the minute I laid eyes on him. I started crying and he immediately licked away my tears. I felt that was my sign from Duke saying this was the right time and this was the dog that needed me. And when I walked into the vet clinic with him the next day the staff cried tears of happiness because they knew how much I needed him. I feel like Duke gave me Moose as his final act of love."
CoronavirusUS,fqg8gas,t3_giqnhy,1589340231.0,"I’m high risk chemo and autoimmune disease but I know we need to reopen. If we don’t there will be no Main Street or Mom and Pop places anymore because they will be bankrupt. People need to get back to work to survive. 

On the flip side right now even if we reopen everything it’s going to be tough because nobody has any money to throw into the local economy because the majority of America is struggling to make ends meet just for basic necessities. The only way we can get the economy flowing again is more direct stimulus payments to the people. 

Then we get into the problem of if we keep feeding people money nobody will want to go back to work. The people working are going to be angry they are working their tails off while people sitting at home are making more money than those working are. Not too mention the dramatically climbing national debt that is hitting 25 trillion. We can’t afford to keep printing money either. 

We also are getting into a situation of UBI. A UBI would lead to hyperinflation. Landlords that charged $800 a month will up rents to $1500-1600, food prices will skyrocket,  everything will go up dramatically. Any way we look at it there’s no good solution. The best solution would have been done initially to curb the spread months ago not waiting until there was a major problem.

All in all I don’t think a lockdown is the best solution unless the government can find a way to keep the economy on pause and provide everyone a basic income that they realistically could survive on. Maybe it could have been possible if they hadn’t pumped billions into the stock market and bailing out the biggest corporations in America and instead investing that money back into the economy by placing it in the hands of the people. 

All I know is this is just the tip of the iceberg regarding the economy. I anticipate more layoffs next month I expect 50-60 million unemployed by the end of June. And I anticipate that around 40-50% of those “furloughed” will find themselves being permanently laid off by the end of this. I also anticipate 20-30% of the businesses forced to close will never reopen again. It’s grim and it’s not a pretty picture.

I really don’t know how mean it was for my company to lay me off. We lost our building and 1200 cars out of our 1500 we had in inventory from the Nashville tornado while I was sick. Then Covid hit with shutdowns and our economy tanked hard and fast. 95% of us got laid off. Up until that point they paid me every Friday religiously even when I wasn’t working. They took really good care of us and promised us our jobs back eventually but I can’t wait I need health insurance to stay healthy. If they would have continued our health care for us I would have waited for as long as I could financially which most likely would have been a year. I loved it there and loved everyone I worked with. We had an excellent CEO who was hands on and there every day after the tornado. When I got sick he had groceries and meals delivered to me and sent flowers. One of my coworkers lost their home in the storm and he rented an apartment for her and bought her all new furniture, dishes, etc and gave her $2,500 in cash to buy new clothes plus a 1k gift card to Kroger to buy food.

If there isn’t any money flowing to businesses they can’t afford to open up, pay their workers and bring workers back. It’s a double edged sword. We need to reopen to keep people alive but we need to also get Americans the money they need to be able to have discretionary income to spend in the economy.

When my SO went to confront the neighbor he threw the puppy head first into a cinder block retaining wall and threatened to assault my SO. I called animal control while this was going on from inside our apartment and had a clear view of it.  The neighbor actually said that’s how I was raised to treat dogs. That’s how my daddy and grandad taught me to train them. This was a 12-16 week old pit bull puppy that’s major offense was getting a chicken bone they left unattended on a coffee table. A dog does not deserve that kind of treatment. Ever.

It’s allowed me to put a healthy amount away in case of an extended period of unemployment/ leave of absence from RA. I know realistically it’s a possibility that I have to stop working for months maybe even permanently so I have saved every cent I can in the event of worst case scenario.  I made a decent income but live in the cheapest apartment I could find, drive a cheap and practical but reliable used car, but most of my clothes from consignment shops or thrift stores (I live in an extremely wealthy area where designer clothes with tags still on are donated to Goodwill regularly) I have got my budget so tight I can live off 24k a year and be comfortable.

Better for me they don’t know how much of a scary cat he actually is (he ran away scared out of his mind from a baby bunny the other night).

I’d like to think that was his way of giving me a sign everything is going to be ok.

My grandfather did it for another 20 years before he retired from Ford. 

That Rottie made me think of a joke my grandpa told me. It goes:

A man breaks into a dark house. Suddenly he hears a voice saying Jesus is watching you. He ignores it and starts rummaging around. Once again he hears Jesus is watching you. So he flips on a light to see who was talking. In the corner he sees a parrot. He asks the parrot what’s your name? The parrot then says Moses. The guy laughs and asks who names a parrot Moses?

She made it very clear that she thought my RA was bullshit and I was just too lazy to work. She would say this in front of everyone on my team causing resentment. I finally stood up to her and said flat out it wasn’t acceptable, she was being extremely unprofessional and was setting the company up for a massive lawsuit for violations of the ADA laws, retaliation, harassment and discrimination. I talked to my HR and she was sent to ADA training, given a formal write up for harassment and was told if she had one complaint about anything she would be terminated immediately. It wasn’t ideal but it was better than nothing. 

Then the tornado happened a few weeks later and our job was destroyed. I had been hit with a covid diagnosis the day before the storm. We all got laid off in April because we couldn’t stay open anymore.

I had a fever of 102-104 for 3 weeks straight, pneumonia, completely short of breath every time I moved it felt like my lungs were collapsing. I couldn’t walk 6 feet from my bed to my bathroom without feeling like I was suffocating to death. I was so tired I couldn’t move from my bed. My lungs burned so bad it felt like someone had poured in molten lava and lit the fires of hell inside then the devil sent a horse to kick me square in the chest. The cough was so severe I couldn’t do anything but cry from pain. The first couple of weeks even going to the bathroom would have me hitting my knees sobbing in pain wishing for death. In hindsight I probably should have been admitted because I was in super bad shape but my little sister is a nurse and my cousin is a nurse practitioner checking on me daily. I felt safer at home than in a hospital. 

After week 3 I started to improve. I still had the cough, shortness of breath, chest pain and joint pain but I could actually climb half a flight of stairs before getting short of breath. I could start doing more for myself.  I got my appetite back. Suddenly I wanted to eat everything in sight. I was able to walk outside in the yard and watch my dog play. I was able to spend some time in my living room and watch tv or read on the couch. I had enough energy to do laundry again or cook a simple meal. For another 2 weeks though I was still pretty much down. I’m 1000 mph all day every day so for me to be down and knocked flat on my ass it’s saying a lot. It’s completely out of character for me. 

The aftermath has been almost as bad as the covid. My CRP levels are super high nearly 10x higher than they should be. My joints are still swollen and inflamed. I’m still really fatigued and running on 1/4 tank vs a full one.  I know a full recovery is going to be a lot harder with RA and recently going into remission for cancer. I’ve also been furloughed, lost my health insurance, had my job destroyed by a tornado, had several friends lose their homes, had severe storms Sunday that flooded my living room and took out power for 2 days so I know that swallowing all that stress on top of a major illness will trigger a flare and make it harder to recover from the flare.

Each step I took felt like I was being buried alive and my lungs were collapsing. My chest hurt so bad it felt like a horse kicked me square in it. The inside of my lungs burned so bad it felt like a cross of molten lava being poured in and the fires of hell being light inside of me. Forget about coughing I wished for death every time I coughed it hurt so damn bad. I got pneumonia. I had a fever of 102-104 for 3 weeks straight. I was chilled to the bone and burning up at the same time. Every joint in my body was inflamed and swollen but that had nothing on the pain in my chest.  Pain so bad I would drop to my knees sobbing begging to either recover or die. I was so exhausted I couldn’t even move out of bed. 

It’s no fucking joke so I hate seeing people say it’s just the flu or it’s a bad cold. No it’s a fucking fate worse than death I wouldn’t wish on anybody no matter how horrible of a person they are. Nobody deserves what Covid does to you. My heart breaks for those that didn’t recover and had to die a painful, agonizing death alone. I spent a lot of time crying for absolute strangers that died from this. I spent a lot of time praying for absolute strangers as well. It definitely changed me and will impact me forever. It was panic inducing at best. I’ve never felt I was so close to death as I did with Covid. I can say I got myself right with the good Lord real quick. Took out extra life insurance, got my will in order, planned my funeral and went over my final wishes with my hubby because I thought for sure I wasn’t strong enough to pull through this. I had cancer earlier and still do chemo so I had 2 things working against me. I’m not usually gloom and doom I took cancer like a boss and kicked it’s ass proudly (my mom died from the same cancer I had at 42)but Covid scared me like nothing else has. I used to run into burning buildings for 10 years as a career  (aka firefighter) so I’m pretty fearless. 

As for the aftermath it’s been a month since I was officially considered “cured”. My RA is kicking my ass still. I’m in a constant flare, my CRP levels are extremely high hovering at 4.9 and it should be under 0.5 so nearly 10x higher than they should be. I also got laid off and lost my health insurance coverage so I’m having to re-evaluate my treatment plan for some lower cost alternatives. We also had the great Nashville tornado a day after I got diagnosed which destroyed my job and many of my friends homes. Fortunately ours was spared but it’s been a stressful few months. We had severe storms Sunday and had significant damage including our living room flooding, no power for 2 days and losing a full deep freezer and fridge full of food. So all the stress isn’t helping getting my flare under control. It’s been a lot for anyone to handle let alone handle with RA."

Even with the presidential order.  In some ways I can’t blame them.

The big problem is this extra unemployment money.
