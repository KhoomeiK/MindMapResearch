TheSilphArena,flcu846,t1_flcsqzz,1585046776.0,"Well, as glassy as Gardevoir is (plus being a shadow makes it even more glassy), I don't think charge moves will be necessary for her. Charm will do all the damage most of the time but I will still recommend to at least have Shadow ball with her.

And a side note, Gardevoir core gameplay is a bit hard to pull in the current meta so you might still struggle in using her even with the compositions I've listed above. Just explore and try it without high hopes to minimize disappointments."
TheSilphArena,flctkwb,t1_flcstg0,1585045996.0,"Yeah, specialists like Gardevoir really consumes shields. That's why it is good to have something at the back that doesn't need shield for endgame such as Umbreon. The need of shield is also the reason why Gardevoir is not a good closer because most of the time, shields are down in the endgame. I've encountered Shadow Gardevoir users a couple times (and they both used it as a closer) and their Gardevoir hit the floor right away."
TheSilphArena,flcsgsi,t3_fo2i7i,1585044590.0,"If you lead with her, bring a mud boi (Whiscash or Swampert) or counter users (DD/ Medicham/ lucario) as her protector against steel types and bring one generalist such as Umbreon/Registeel/Skarmory/Altaria. Don't pair her with Azumarill because that will make your team so vulnerable to steels and grass types.

If you want to put her in the back, bring a lead that will lure dragons or fighters  (Registeel/Scrafty/Bastiodon/etc) then bring a strong generalist (same list above except don't bring Azumarill).

Sample compositions: (first ones are leads)

Gardevoir, Whiscash, Skarmory

Gardevioir, Medicham, Bastiodon

Gardevoir, DD, Umbreon

Gardevoir, Swampert, Skarmory

Personally, I'd love to use Gardevoir as a lead so that I can switch her out right away when at disadvantage or give shields to her when at advantage. She's not a good safe switch and is not a good closer as well because she needs shields."

And if Jin Woo was indeed there for 2 days, doesn't that mean he haven't eaten nor took a bath 2 days straight? (though, based on the pattern of the manhwa, they might show that Jin Woo left the island w/in that 2 days).

I even forgot to mention about the surviving male Japanese hunter. Did Beru really let him go when in fact he can outrun anyone present in the island except Jin Woo? Not really sure why they did that though."

He might have something that can soft counter Skarmory at his back but he wont be able to take it down right away. Skarmory might even win if you drop a shield and if not, it would still break shields or deal a huge amount of damage before dying.

 If you're not confident with your safe switch mon however, you can fight with Azu. With its bulk, it can tank at least one FP or two so it will be able to throw IB that will force the opponent to shield. If you're lucky enough to throw 2 IB, it would be a really good advantage."
