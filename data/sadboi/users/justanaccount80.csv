Kayaking,fpd85oz,t1_fpd5pip,1588521809.0,"Absolutely!!  I'm not as well versed as everyone else here, I don't know the technical terms, or physics and what not. I literally just bought my kayak one day and just dumped it on the water right after I got it, not knowing what tf I was doing.

I just learned through experience, trials and failures. Still learning to be honest! I've had mine for 5 years now, and I've been taking it out this year ever since it's gotten warmer. I'm relearning the rhythm of the water and how it affects my paddles now. Tides change, sand changes, seasons bring new life into the rivers. I'm on the Chesapeake in MD, so it's a bit different from one year to another here. 

BUT!! The foot braces DO absolutely help, if you have them. You can ground your center of balance and use your leg muscles to help stay in that center and not tip over. 

It's all just another learning experience, that's all. Try not to get frustrated or give up, because its amazing once you get the hang of it. :)

Good luck out there, and please wear your gear, and stay safe!!"
