Dealing with these issues is hard. Having someone encourage you to do things that can help is good.

They’re right and the steps they encourage would be beneficial. It’s a fine line to walk. 

I imagine the way he’s encouraging you is really just making you feel like you’ve failed. I would try to think about the way this makes you feel and have a real talk with him:

“Hey I know you might not understand. I appreciate that you’re wanting me to do better but the way you try to help..etc/ your tips are good but it’s hard for me to initiate because...etc/ it would be more helpful if you did this...etc/ it makes me feel like....etc.”"

Get a lawyer and look at your options for custody. If he is willing to sign his rights away that is his choice. If his lifestyle is going to be one that puts your baby in a dangerous or unstable position then fight to get full custody.
