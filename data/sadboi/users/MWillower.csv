That’s something I honestly would love to incorporate in my own writing. I could picture everything you wrote vividly, but more importantly, I felt like I was hanging out in the narrators head. 

This poem capitalizes on a vintage glamorization of cigarettes, bringing me in to an almost noir perspective. It all fit effortlessly as cigarettes (and some might say unadulterated passion/craving) have begun to fall out of fashion. 

Personally, I really liked this poem. It’s clear to me that you’re skilled at creating electric, living poetry. So I’d be interested to read something a bit more out of the ordinary. I’d love if you used your writing abilities to create something with a fresher, stranger, or more abstract context. 

Thank you so much for sharing your poem!"
OCPoetry,ffpgx3y,t3_euft0h,1580094765.0,"This poem has an almost *eerily* calm vibe to me. I like that the structure and flow parallels the theme, in the sense that the poem reads in an almost dripping, melting, fashion.

I think the second stanza is much stronger than the first. I felt there were a few rhymes that could be perceived as being a bit generic, and it cheapened the poem a bit for me. I have a tendency to do the same thing on my first draft.
I think it’d make this a much stronger piece if you went back and looked at a few words or lines and reflected on them a bit more.

For example: 

“kisses like morse code sent through the **air**”

“wasps at her feet and **no one’s there**”

can you feel it coming **down from nowhere**”

I feel like the ingenuity of verses like “wasps at her feet” are dampened by the words I bolded (common rhymes). 

This isn’t a critique but I thought it might be kind of cool if you added another stanza in between the first and the last, giving it even more of a “melting” transition. When you used the word “rising” at the beginning of the last line of your first stanza. I felt the verb could be an introduction to a few more lines beginning with “ing”. For example:

“rising like the heat in the devil’s lair

(Verb ending in -ing), line

(Verb ending in -ing), line

(Verb ending in -ing), line

melting like the rain in the palm of your hand”

I liked that you began every sentence in the last stanza with melting. it gave it a uniquely hypnotic feel. 

Thanks for sharing your poem, it’s almost reminiscent of being so stoned I’d feel I was melting in to a chair. That feeling, but with another person, is something I’ll have to think about."

I think a lot of times people just don’t know what to do or say. That might’ve been only thing your mom could think of in that moment. It’s hard dealing with these kinds of thoughts, and it’s hard for people to know how to respond to them.

It helps to find someone who is more educated on how to respond, like a therapist, or even someone who’s gone through something similar and can relate.

OCPoetry,ff1eb0a,t3_er496k,1579478103.0,"I really like the title of your poem, I think it’s very fitting and centers it a bit. On my first read my impression was that it’s a little vague, but maybe it’s supposed to be that way. After reading a few more times I noticed a few poignant themes woven throughout.

The lines “the bell tolls” the stare holds” “the breath stops” have a nice rhythm. I think your poem flows, but introduces new elements at a nice pace.

It has a very intense, masculine, almost sexual energy: especially in the line “a desire to penetrate”. It’s almost a little overwhelming (which in my opinion, is a good thing in a poem.) 

I like the contrast of that energy with a few lines, that to me indicate an almost loss of innocence, as in “the last petal drops” and “the butterfly dies”. I really appreciate your ability to weave these thoughts together consistently. 

Great job!"

With the “disease his mother blamed on his soul” I was referring to a man with schizophrenia, whose parents abandoned because they believed he was possessed.  

The poem is actually set in a mental hospital, all the people are ones that I met while in one. I guess I tried to make it vague to conceal that fact, but I should definitely reflect on it.

There’s a lot of life here, and you conveyed the feeling of wanderlust and peace within oneself with such wonderful metaphors.

I had a hard time finding any critiques, the only one I spotted was very small.

The last two lines of your second paragraph use “like” twice. Like is kind of a harsh feeling word, and this poem is so soft and beautiful. I feel it might flow better if you replaced one of the like’s with an “as if”, for example:

“As if a dream had led me to paradise”

 “Emerald reflections” is repeated a few times in your poem, but I had a hard time connecting the two sentences it appears in (besides being near the first and last lines). I think your first paragraph is very poignant, and the visual of acid rain falling on an outstretched tongue is beautiful. This poem has an almost psychedelic feel to me, which I love. The last four lines of your second paragraph make me feel like it’s almost missing a sentence. I love the idea of “concentrated flavor” but want to know more about what that tastes like.

I adore the last two lines, I think you made a good choice by separating them, because they’re written in a very different tone. I feel like they cut straight through to a raw feeling. I love when a writer can express such a specific feeling without naming it. I really enjoyed reading your poem, thanks for sharing!"

A lot of the time I eat because I’m bored, so to fight that I’ll drink some tea and read a book, drink some water, or have a cup of coffee. I’ll try to replace eating out of boredom with anything else.
