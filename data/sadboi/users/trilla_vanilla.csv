depression,fol6w1j,t3_g7soko,1587856056.0,"I love it because it takes away the guilt and shame that I have from sitting around doing nothing, because I know everyone’s doing that and there are no other options. I would be totally fine doing it for a year—it’s too exhausting trying to act like a functioning human being so this is like a free pass"
EatingDisorders,fol6nkj,t3_g5ca72,1587855925.0,"I’m in a similar position so just know you’re not alone! I had struggled with restricting throughout college and got better about eating more normally and I stayed at a good weight. Then I graduated college and got really into drugs and lost like 30 pounds in 2 months. I’ve been sober for a few months now and while I’m glad to have gotten my life together, I’ve developed crazy binging that I keep trying to stop and I keep failing. Initially I was just recovering from starving from doing drugs so I knew I would gain some weight, but within like 5 months I’ve gained the 30 lbs back and probably at least 10-20 more (that’s like 50 lbs in 5 months which is horrifying). I think the problem is that I started to associate eating with happiness and calmness (once I stopped doing drugs the withdrawal made me extremely anxious and depressed so while I was getting back to being healthy I would just watch tv and eat and it was the first time I started to feel good while I was sober). I’m trying to figure out how to fix it but so far it’s been hard. So I totally feel you. We will figure it out day by day."

AskWomen,fojv0kq,t3_g7nghn,1587829960.0,"I took more intense measures but it was the only thing that actually made my life drastically improved. I moved away, went to rehab, started to actually take care of my mental health, started working out and started following my gut. When nothing was working in my life, deep down I knew it was because of what I was doing. Now if I’m thinking of doing something that deep down I know is not great for me, I don’t do it. And if something is difficult but I know it will pay off, I force myself to do it. And I also got really into the law of attraction."

People just need to suck it up and ride it out just like this old woman so the ones who are elderly and alone don’t have to stay isolated longer because of the selfishness of younger people."
addiction,fohufjg,t3_g7hccw,1587772853.0,"This EXACT thing happened to me. Adderall/ritalin was my DOC and it was manageable for about two years but then I started taking so much that I thought people were looking in my windows, I thought cops were following me, I literally couldn’t go to the grocery store by the end because I was convinced that people were after me and I was in trouble (I didn’t do anything that would cause anyone to be after me but the paranoia made me act so crazy that police actually did start to watch me). The paranoia was when I realized I really had to get help and I went to rehab and it took 2 months of being totally sober for the paranoia to go away. I also thought I was showing signs of schizophrenia but if you’re abusing amphetamine it is almost certainly paranoia caused by drugs and once you stop it subsided."
depression,fohtcau,t3_g76n13,1587772253.0,"Yes—it would at least take away the shame of doing nothing if I had a reason. Thankfully I’ve somehow gotten out of a major depressive episode that lasted for over two years and stopped doing drugs and feel the most normal I have in such a long time, but I think no matter how good things get I always fantasize about something horrible happening."
