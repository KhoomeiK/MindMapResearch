Your family wronged you in so many ways that go against there own narrative of ""blood before anything."" Now they suddenly expect you to go through a potentially harmful surgery for someone who was a complete and utter pos to you your entire life. They have proven that blood ties dont really matter anyway in how they treated you their own son. They deserve nothing from you.

Words from an online stranger really can't suffice learning from a professionally trained vocal coach who watches you sing and critiques and corrects you as you go along. I used to scour the internet for advice and methods for learning how to sing. I could name you 10 youtube voice teachers off the top of my head who I watched daily yet didn't learn shit.
