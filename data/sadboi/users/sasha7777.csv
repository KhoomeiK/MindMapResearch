The only way this would be worse if he started whistling at those serving him like they were dogs (which can happen).
It doesn‚Äôt make it special that he has a relationship with each server or bartender, it‚Äôs part of the job. You‚Äôre very observant and on the right path!"

I really regret not standing my ground because as you said, you are an invited guest of your boyfriend. If you are required to pay rent, ask for a contract and let them know that you will be declaring this on your income taxes, which will therefore affect how much they can claim on their own taxes.
It‚Äôs absolutely ludicrous. Before you ask, I was already renting my own place in a different city. I just crashed at my boyfriend‚Äôs place when I worked til 11 in one city and had class in the next city at 7:30 am."

When we first cuddled up, I was worried that I was cutting off circulation, hurting him somehow, because I could feel him consistently moving. When telling him a story and his eyes were darting around, I thought I was either offending or boring him with what I was talking about. I had to finally ask him and he told me had a few tic and Tourette‚Äôs. I really wish he told me first because it was a difficult thing to bring up. 
Please ask her if she hasn‚Äôt brought it up. I never asked him why he didn‚Äôt bring it up first and now that I look back, I think he was embarrassed. Asking him was never the issue, I just wish I asked sooner!"
