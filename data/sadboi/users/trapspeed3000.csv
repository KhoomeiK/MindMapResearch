Few pieces of advice off the top of my head. 

Wait three days for purchases over X amount. Put shit in your Amazon cart instead of buy it now then wait. Consult with trusted friends/family before making major decisions. 

Don't tell many people but do tell one or two close to you.

ALWAYS take your meds. This doesn't have a cure and you don't just get better. 

Don't smoke weed. For some of us it that really compounds shit.
