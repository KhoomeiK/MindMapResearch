It's way more rewarding when you schedule something you actually want to do in your day, for me it's sport, and then get back in the office. usually that thing is... Your source of procrastination.

And I gotta say, the amount of shit dropped on you, all summed up is a lot... I can relate to you so much. I developed some kind of vehicle/closed spaces anxiety after a few years of people dieing around me. I'm 32. I've been in this for quite a while and there's multiple things that helped me, but none of them are ""nice"" solutions. There was one phase where the general area I lived in had accumulated so many bad memories, that I needed to move to get better. There was a time where I had to drop all hobbies, think about what I ACTUALLY like and continue doing THOSE things instead of the bad ones. There was a time where I had to do this with certain people in my life. Basically, whenever I lost control, it was because I was letting outside-factors make decisions for me. I felt helpless, because I was convinced that I deserved bad things to happen to me, because, you know, why were ALL of the possible worst things happening to me?! Like, I like this person a lot, boom, Blood-poisoning. I mean what? So I have to do my best to take a step back when I'm not feeling well and take care of the problem. I have to be egoistic during these moments so I can still be happy, in working condition and provide and give back to others. I figured, the most important and nicest thing I could do to myself, even if I don't care much about me or my health, is find things that I like doing with or for others when I'm at my best...and push myself to keep myself in that position. Even if it means giving up on something or someone, even just for a while.

To the situation with William: that's so bad, I'm really sorry. I've only heard how peoples personalities changed from taking too many drugs like MDMA/excstacy... But I've seen it in a parent with a brain-tumor. When I started to accept that he is different now, but I kinda can still feel something for him, he died. I took a step back then, locked my feelings away for a few years and then started to rethink how I love. 

I'm certain that you can get through all this without meds. I can not tell you how, but I think you'll figure it out. I do not know if putting yourself and your health first would help you, but it would make a few things easier here and there, at least it did for me. 

Stay strong, it's a battle.

I'm going to keep this feeling alive in me, by stopping to write, to sketch, to draw, to act. I'll pick up other hobbies, some I can do and enjoy on my own without ever being yelled at or laughed at or ignored for. I tried too many times to make other peoples days better by doing something nice for them.

I'll start some sport that's just between me and the thing. I won't talk about it. I'll stop talking about things I like altogether. Being very passionate, it's going to be hard, but there are lots of podcasts out there, so that's okay for conversations. I will do this because it hurts to be rejected, hurt so hard whenever I open up, time and time again and I can't take it anymore. I don't want to hurt myself. I don't want to loose these feelings, this passion, this energy, this kindness I want to give... I like these things a lot about me.

AskReddit,fn94eon,t1_fn8xis9,1586759033.0,"I once tried to see what I could find when I dig around. I found Guys headshotting women, the video continuing as the blood runs down a white wall and just silence for minutes. I found a video where a guy beheads people in a forest with a hunting knife, perfect HD quality. I found trobes of leaked crimescene pictures on imgur of raped and killed women and so on. You can google that stuff, it's just a search or two away. It made me realise how common all of this is, how far we're away from being ""civilized"" and how bad we are at getting rid of evil."

AskReddit,fn8yowf,t1_fn84fy3,1586753924.0,I find his stories  have a lot of humor. They never fail to make me smile.
mentalhealth,fn8ye3m,t1_fn8lj5o,1586753675.0,"Absolutely not. That City is dirty, lots of crime, highest unemployment rate in the whole country, failed immigration programs. Now I live in a mountaineous region, animals everywhere, employment rates aroung 96% instead of 85% and so on...
It was a good decision."

mentalhealth,fn7yg4j,t1_fn7xmaw,1586730163.0,"Yes, I feel fine, body is up and running again, did some cycling and hiking, seems to work.  Mentally though... I mean look outside. I just have ""that many friends"", none live nearby. Even if I wanted to cheat quarantine, it's a 3 hour drive. I moved last year to leave a place I didn't like to get to my dream home. We have our first drought of the year, trees are dying... I read ""Adult children of emotionally immature parents"" and it hit Home like nothing. I think I had a small breakdown today."
mentalhealth,fn7xjtq,t1_fn7v1l6,1586729643.0,"Worst part was when I thought I might have covid but nobody wanted to test me, as I hadn't been in contact with anyone confirmed and the flu was going around. Lung was free all the time but I had such a bad runny nose, aching all over the place. Thinking positively was hard. Hope your surgery went well."
mentalhealth,fn79jae,t1_fn78mkx,1586715939.0,"My Brother doesn't care about me and my mother doesn't know how to communicate, she's ""emotionally immature"". My load is too much to handle to dump it on friends. I tried many times. I can talk to Therapists and feel understood, others don't seem to be experienced enough or whatever... Missing words. I'm probably totally wrong about this, but it's not important. I don't matter. That's all I want people to understand when they have to deal with me."
mentalhealth,fn78gio,t3_g01kpw,1586715334.0,"I've been alone for some 7 weeks now. Been sick the first three, now I'm sometimes doing a bit of Homeoffice. Went from binging Netflix and YouTube to videogames with friends to dreading my existence, realising what was wrong all along, feeling extremely lonely, crying, feeling helpless, not seeing a future for the world and currently binge-cooking, more crying and holding myself back from eating too much or starting to drink."
NoStupidQuestions,fn4icc6,t1_fn34kg9,1586641982.0,"Don't most Bugs only see chromatic? So light = sun = go? And darker areas are avoided. Also I think I heard that flys have such a short memory, the moment they fly away an inch from a window they have forgotten why their head hurts."

mentalhealth,fn2o8ba,t3_fyxy9c,1586596566.0,"Yeah, you get used to it. Getting put of it and being happy can be very hard and scary, cause anxiety and so on. It's quite some work, but you gotta try."
