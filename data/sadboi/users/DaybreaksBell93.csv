So when I go back, it'll be NS II all over again for a week or two, with totally new batches of people. 

My company was known as the ""China Company"" for a reason. Lots of PRC PRs seeking to get SG Citizenship got put into my company (not gonna disclose, but it's in Transport, and requires clearance on a level you can't get for Malay drivers). Every single one of them were self-serving, self-isolating-in-their-own-community jerks who made no secret of the true reason why they did NS, what they saw in the value of SG citizenship (they only wanted to springboard out to other countries with our better passport), and how they disdained the SAF compared to their ""great"" military back in the Motherland. Those who weren't PRCs were the typical ah beng ah seng kias whose lives revolved round Thai Discos and partying life outside of camp, though in terms of work ethic in camp they were pretty alright and pulled their weight well.

Society shouldn't go down the shitter simply to save some old people on their way out. And yes, if it were my parents or grand parents, I'd say the same too. Their time's up, their time's up. No point prolonging it."

TrueUnpopularOpinion,fpehygq,t1_fpe9jhr,1588547902.0,Words out of my mouth. This is why more men nowadays would rather stay single and pay for sex if they want it.
YangForPresidentHQ,fpeb5m6,t1_fpdi8wo,1588544007.0,"Remote work would need very stable, fast and secure fibre broadband though. Is that something people get outside of the major cities in the US? I highly doubt it."
