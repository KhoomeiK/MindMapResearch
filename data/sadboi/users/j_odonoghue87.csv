bipolar,fblifi1,t3_edqmzb,1576963333.0,I take 250 of the generic version (lamotrigine) along with generic Wellbutrin and seraquel. Saved my marriage.
depression,fak88jy,t3_e9hksr,1576162666.0,"Yes! Like, it’s not something I concentrate on, but it makes me a little salty. I’m 32, I work retail, and I still don’t even have a bachelors degree. Now, I am in the process of working on it, but because I’m married and am the only person in my family with a job, I only take one class a semester so I can put in at least 40 hours a week at work. I also have Bipolar 2, which is why I screwed up my first round of college, so I’ve been afraid to take on too much.  But everyone in my family (dad, mom, and all three sisters) has a degree except me."

CounselingPsychology,fafji3q,t1_faagazn,1576024317.0,"I’m not trying to diagnosis him. I was just curious, because I had never heard of depression in that particular form before, and since he’s part of the age group I plan on working with, I thought it was a good idea to educate myself. I’ve tried Google, but the only thing that comes up is how important sleep is. I know that, but he only gets it after not getting enough sleep for a few days, and it doesn’t last long."

bipolar2,f97k072,t1_f8xqmd3,1575166626.0,Have you tried taking them at night? I have to split my lamotrigine in half and take one half in the morning and one eight hours(ish) later.
bipolar2,f8vhan5,t3_e2gixb,1574869419.0,"Finding the right med combination is hard. I’m on three right now, and that combo took two years to find. But I don’t get hypomania, I don’t cry on the couch for hours for no reason, I don’t start ridiculous fights with my husband, and I keep my house clean. I stopped getting inspired to write books, but I still knit (my original love) and now I’ve gotten into writing psychology non fiction (psy student). For me, it was worth it."
depression,f8vgb3a,t3_e2g2ol,1574868752.0,"Me too. People always say money doesn’t buy happiness, but it would sure buy mine. Get school loans paid off, get college paid for. And health insurance. Health insurance would make me so happy. Hell, I’d be fine being poor if I could have health insurance. But me in retail and my husband as a janitor make too much money for Medicaid, and not enough to pay for insurance."
