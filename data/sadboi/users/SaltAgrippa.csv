mentalhealth,fqd9ypn,t3_ghrmqw,1589284453.0,"Well it’s complicated. I became comfortable being an introvert during quarantine and breeding habits I couldn’t bother to during a normal weekday. I am no means perfect in aspects of discipline lol, but I am getting there. Come out from isolation stronger or more experienced in something than before. I learned how to play the guitar during quarantine to fit the mood with some blues hahaha"

Guys come up the ice with the puck and pass it or shoot it, which after (assuming the puck ends up near the net) they glide into the front of the goal or peel around. Correct me if I’m wrong, this is what I know from my experience playing at my age."

Right before you are about to do something that your anxiety has been leading up to (speaking in front of a crowd, asking someone out, etc.), count to three in your mind slowly. I like to use the analogy of a drop tower, like the ones in amusement parks. The scariest ones don’t tell you when they are going to drop. It is always 100% not as bad as you think it is, if you know when whatever your doing is coming. This is why you count to 3. And remember, even if you do slip up and something embarrassing happens or something like that, people will eventually get over it. JUST DO IT. ;)"

mentalhealth,erybdg5,t3_c4thdm,1561404743.0,"As Vincent Van Gogh once said, “I would rather die of passion than of boredom.” I have no idea what it must feel like to be chronically suicidal, and I’m sorry to hear that you are diagnosed with that, but there is so much more to life than you could have ever imagined. I had a friend who had depression when I was a teenager. When I moved away for two years he still had depression. When I came back from those two years in a Europe, he gained 100k followers on Instagram, several sponsors, free tickets to events, and he loved doing it, which was skateboarding. Find a passion, something that you know is right for you, something that you love doing, and stick with it. Don’t ever let go. Then you’ll discover what life has to offer."
