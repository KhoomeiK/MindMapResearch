To be banned from your xbox as a kid I can imagine is a significant event. He got his lesson already. No value in finding out what he said to shame him, you'll get a kid who won't tell you when he messed up and won't ask you for help when he is in danger. He deleted them because he is either shit scared or ashamed and knows he did something wrong. He probably has a good sense that his behavior was out of line by now. Remember that horrible gut feeling you got as a kid when you did something wrong, I tell you that stuff is powerful. No need to make it bigger. I take it you are worried about your kid and want to correct his behavior but try and see this perspective also."

SoccerBetting,fjojwey,t1_fjoiusy,1583529233.0,"I've won so much betting against barcelona recently it's become a habit. Research tends to show that home advantage is smaller in post-season. It's not that I think it's highly likely they will lose, but I think 9 odds are a really good value. Sociedad killed Valencia 3-0 and beat Real Madrid and Bilbao, the two last teams beat Barcelona. Even at home Barcelona has only beat Sociedad by one goal, their two last meetings, and you can argue that Sociedad is in relatively better form, although their away form hasn't been best  


I believe Martin Ødegaard and Isak can take this. Messi has been looking injured. Hypothetically I think sociedad would win much more than 1/9 if you simulated this many times over. I know if I would have bet barcelona @ 1.3 odds I would be shitting myself."
