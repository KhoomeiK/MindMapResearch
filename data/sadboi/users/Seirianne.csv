suggestmeabook,fr083un,t3_glv3mj,1589786670.0,"The Name of The Wind (Kingkiller Chronicles) is a very popular adult fantasy series right now. It's kind of like an autobiography about the many, amazing adventures of a young mage/musician/inventor/man of many hats named Kvothe. A big part of it happens at a school which I mention since you like Harry Potter (though otherwise it's not very similar).


The Codex Alera by Jim Butcher is awesome. It's about an underdog boy named Tavi who is smart but has no powers in a world where pretty much everyone has some kind of magic ability based on elemental spirits and there's a lot of dangerous political unrest. The world is completely fictitious but the main culture has a strong Roman influence. The world, characters, magic, action, crazy levels of epicness, and battle strategies in it are all good. First book is called Furies of Calderon.


The Wheel of Time by Robert Jordan is very popular: Monsters attack a rustic farming village in pursuit of a few teenagers that may be connected to a prophecy. In order to protect the village, they flee with a visiting witch and a gruff swordsman and embark on a great journey where they pursue their destinies, try to save the world from the forces of evil controlling the monsters, and avoid corrupt magic.


If you want hilarious comedy adult fantasy, Terry Pratchett's your man. Solid British humor and self awareness. There's a few places you can start but a lot of people recommend starting with Guards! Guards!


Personally I'm a big fan of Brandon Sanderson so here are three series by him that are good:


Mistborn-- In a world where ashes fall at day and mists fall at night, where everyone is ruled by an all powerful, immortal, and uncaring emperor, a thief girl with rare powers is brought into a band of rebels to fight against said emperor. It's a dark, gothic, epic fantasy, with blood and ash and nuanced powers, politics, and romantic intrigue.



Elantris--A kind prince, loved by his people, lives a happy life until one day he wakes up cursed by a random sort of magical death leprosy. Like all cursed ones he is abandoned in a ruined, mysterious city called Elantris, where he fights to not succomb to the literal pits of despair and find out how to get out. You get a pretty complete story in just one book so if you don't like long series this one might be good.



The Way of Kings (Stormlight)-- in a fascinating world of rock plants, crustaceous animals, and massive storms, a slave fights against his circumstances and struggles between depression and heroism. A seemingly naive and innocent girl embarks on an elaborate con against a very intelligent and dangerous target. A legendary general embroiled in a never-ending war is haunted by visions and grows increasingly convinced that the war is wrong. It's a massive and detailed story with a slow start that builds into Avengers level of epicness. 


Aaaand finally if you don't want something super dense, this is YA but: The Riyria Revelations by Michael J. Sullivan is an excellent fantasy series with cool adventures that doesn't take much energy to read. Main characters are a classy and awesome thief/mercenary duo who get framed for something and, against their better judgement, get wrapped up in saving their kingdom."

If you like fantasy then the Riyria Revelations are an easy to get into and super fun read. A lot of fantasy is really dense and you have to put a lot of energy in to get into it, but Riyria intentionally tries to not be dense or overly detailed.

I'd also recommend looking into books you might have heard of a lot. A Song of Ice and Fire. Fahrenheit 451. Slaughterhouse Five. The Golden Compass. The Handmaid's Tale. On the Road. Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. Dune. Or tons of others.
Only go after them if they sound interesting to you, but usually if something's really famous and successful I find that there's a reason for it, so they're worth checking out."

So then is there any point to life? If there wasn't a point to life, would we have ever existed? Is it possible for something as complex as the existence of our world and selves and everything to be completely meaningless? People like to accept that everything is meaningful and good because that feels good. Other people like to accept that there's no reason and nothing matters because they feel it's more realistic. I just say no one really knows, and anyone who says they do can't prove it definitively to the rest of us.

What most people agree on is that we only get one shot at this particular life/timeline. So do things that feel right to you and see if you find anything worthwhile. We'll all end up dead, eventually, so live your life looking for good things in case there is a point. In the end, you'll either be unaware of ever having lived so you won't miss it, or you'll be given new rules to play by and maybe you'll be happy for some things you did or experienced in your current life."
GenderCritical,fq53wih,t3_gfzlgy,1589091710.0,"Some think that marriage is less meaningful than just choosing everyday to be with someone, without being bound legally. I agree with that sentiment, but I think as long as divorce is permitted, I'm personally ok with marriage being a symbol of my commitment to a person with the intent of being lifelong, loving partners, and depending on your definition, starting a new family.

Weddings are steeped in tradition and gender roles. I think any couple getting married should tailor the symbolism and pieces of the wedding to suit them and take or leave tradition. 

If it was my wedding: rings are fine but they should be equal and reciprocal. If my fiance gives me an engagement ring, I'd like to have one to give him too. I don't care if he proposes to me or not, but if he does it in a public setting I'm answering how I want to, even if that's ""no"".

Dress wouldn't be white because I like to break arbitrary traditions to remind myself I can. Also, it symbolizes purity and that shouldn't be the focus.

Don't love the idea of my dad giving me away, but if my fiance's mom gives him away, then alright I guess. I know that makes us each seem less independent but I don't care too much if it shows our immediate family moving on to a new generation.

No veil.

DecidingToBeBetter,fpc16nv,t3_gch5ji,1588484371.0,"I think you could use more hope, and pride even in small things.


If you want to build positive energy and motivation I would pick something you want to get better at (even if you don't care tons) and decide on an easy daily goal for it (super easy like a half hour max at first) and try to do it every day or every other day. Make a calendar and cross out every day you do it ( r/theXeffect ) so you can visually see your progress in it and cultivate a sense of pride and accomplishment. 


If you just want to do fun things then is there a fun thing that is better for you than another one? Do you like playing videogames more than scrolling through social media? Do you like making tasty/pretty food? Or making art with a kick-ass soundtrack in the background? Taking pictures of your pet or nature or something? Some things that are more fun take just a little more energy to get started. So I'd try to do more of those things: fun activities that are cooler to you and better for you than just the easiest sort of ok fun thing. At least if you're having fun in a more hardcore way you can be more satisfied and proud of that at the end of the day.  


If you tend to be really sedentary like me, I recommend a short walk every day if you can. Our feelings are more attached to our bodies than I think we like to admit and walking outside is amazing for our mental and physical health. I always feel better after a walk. 


I usually have better days if I don't spend time in bed on my phone in the morning. I get really addicted and do it too much and it spoils my morning. So sometimes I put my phone on the other side of the room at night so I have to get up to get it in the morning. Then, sometimes I still go back to bed, but I'm more likely to go eat breakfast and start a better day. 


I wonder if you want to escape worldly responsibilities because they've been harsh on you and you feel like you let someone/yourself down and failed too much. Idk, but sometimes I feel like that and I just want everything to f off and let me live my life. But if I forgive myself for screwing up some and realize tons of people do and it's fairly natural and decide to change things and try again I start to care about stuff like ambition again. So that's an idea. Basically to forgive yourself, be gentle to yourself, and try at things even if you messed up before. 


You don't sound very plugged in to a community. It's a tough time to be around other people right now but other people have an energy that can catch on you and inspire you and interest you. Talking to cool people with a strong passion in something can spark your own interests. Talking to people can make you want to have something cool to tell them about. Talking to an encouraging person can make you happy to try things. Not sure if you can find those kinds of people right now but maybe you should at least look for some online. 
(My DM is open if you feel like shooting the breeze)


You sound pretty apathetic but since you posted this here I'd say some part of you has at least some motivation or desire to do better than you are right now. So I argue that you do care, some. When I think I'm apathetic, I usually discover that I have a lot of emotions and care a lot, but it's kind of quiet and subconscious and comes out in rare times. I still think that you care about stuff, but maybe you feel ""quiet"" and disengaged and it's just beneath the surface. 


Tldr: cultivate a sense of accomplishment by small steps, do the things that make you feel better than other things, forgive yourself from failures and keep trying"

I'm going to respond down below but I mean no pressure on you to write back if this is taking up too much of your life. If you want to, great, but I can look in other spots for discussion if you're not feeling another response. 


I like your explanation and description of Genesis, although I don't know what you mean by you guess God did give Adam and Eve a chance to redeem themselves right away through his mission with Abraham. The covenant with Abraham came way after Adam and Eve and a ton of other people lived and died. 


I think you have an interesting point with God being just and fair to victims who suffered intensely from people like Hitler and Stalin. But even though what Hitler did was unspeakably awful, I think eternity is too big to even out with what he did. What a person can do in their one life is finite, and eternity is infinite. If God, to be just, needs to punish Hitler for a thousand years then ok. But to do it for eternity seems wrong, no matter what Hitler did. That's why I think, at least eventually, God should destroy into oblivion someone who would otherwise be in hell forever.

Also, you said in your second to last comment (I think) that the choice we have is to realize that we need Jesus. How is realizing something a choice? You choose based on things you know. You realize something that you don't know, and you don't really have control over whether or not you reach a realization. 

When I said something about ""why do you have to believe in it for it to work?"" You answered you don't have to believe in it. But is God going to forgive you, give you abundant life, and accept you into the new earth like he offers with Jesus if you don't believe it? That's what I mean by ""for it to work""

With the angel idea I wrote about I mainly meant it as a way that everyone could theoretically get past the wondering whether the story of Jesus was true. I'm saying choosing yay or nay to JESUS offering salvation feels like it should be a separate choice from choosing to believe in this STORY. So I wish everyone knew if the story was true or not. If they don't know, and are sensibly concerned that it may have been fabricated to manipulate people, then it feels like that's a silly reason for God to base on saving or not saving people."
coolguides,fnm604a,t1_fnlgoub,1587065695.0,"I'm still not convinced that God didn't make imperfect things and irresponsibly leave them to their own harmful devices when he shouldn't have. And I still don't see why he wanted things with free will. But you make a great point that according to Christian doctrine it didn't start out with them imperfect. I have other questions and issues: if you feel like answering them, shoot. If not, alright thanks for the conversation so far. 

----------------------
If we're going by Genesis, I don't understand why God would allow the fallout of Eve's decision to go further than herself. 

So we were created as perfect beings, and then Eve and inadvertently Adam disobeyed and tainted all of humanity. If we are not reembodiments of Eve herself, with her own soul, then it doesn't feel fair to be tainted by someone else's actions. Why would God allow the rest of us to be broken by her decision? Why didn't he just destroy her or give her a personal shot at forgiveness and redemption, cleanse her innocent children and have them continue on with him in the Garden? 
Or are we all just pieces of her soul reincarnated? 
(Also, is it Adam's fault to have trusted his wife about eating that fruit? Is God willing to punish him when he never intended to disobey, just was dumb and didn't ask the important questions first?)



Then, as the story goes, Jesus died to remove the taint/curse/brokenness for anyone who follows him. 

1) how does a good person dying for evil people make everything ok? That feels even more unjust. Why does God require an innocent sacrifice to forgive sin?
2) why do people have to believe in that, specifically, happening for it to work? Why can't someone just want to be good, or have good intentions and that be enough to God? Because the whole story is spread through hearsay and it feels pretty made-up. 
3) if it does matter so much that people believe that specific story and accept Jesus as their God, then why IS it spread through hearsay and so easy to feel fake and made-up? It feels like the test for our souls and to not waste Jesus' efforts is hanging on whether we are willing to put blind faith into something that is shaky. Why wouldn't God do something like send an angel to every single human in their dreams and say ""do you want to accept my gift, or not?""
4) why are Christians who follow Jesus still broken and messed up?


And then there's hell. 
I've heard descriptions of the fate of non-Christians as fire and eternal torture. I also heard it described as just being forever separated from God, who is what we need.
If it's eternal torture for a one time bad deed or even a full lifetime of bad deeds, that's very wrong. Hitler levels of wrong.
If it's existing incompletely forever, I still think that's wrong, too.
If it's a fixed time of punishment, not eternal, then maybe ok. But I've never heard it described as temporary.
If God made something, and it is flawed then he should either fix it or destroy it (like true obliviation). Not leave it forever to hurt him and hurt itself."
coolguides,fnlj3jv,t1_fnkzwu1,1587054418.0,Why would having immutable proof of God mean we don't have free will?
coolguides,fnlh7je,t1_fnldcey,1587053497.0,"Yeah, I get that maybe we can't just ""get"" everything at this level.

But then what, are we just supposed to say ""this doesn't really make sense to me or add up, but it sounds nice so I guess I'll dedicate my soul and entire being to it anyway""? 

Then why would we choose one religion that doesn't make sense over any other religion that doesn't make sense? If we're just going off of blind faith then what's to stop me from being pagan instead? 

If you argue that we can't understand it, ok, but then why would God punish us for not following him if we don't understand why he's worth following?"
coolguides,fnlg2w4,t1_fnlfarf,1587052932.0,Now that's an interesting idea.
coolguides,fnlfmr5,t1_fnldfob,1587052708.0,"I think you make a good point here. That naturally if we have free will, we can choose evil and bring evil into the world that didn't have it originally. Free will says we're allowed to do something like that. 

But I think a sticking point for me is: why does free will have to exist for anyone but God? If God is perfect and complete, then why does he need little imperfect not-Gods to love him? 

Would us choosing to go to him and love him prove how desirable and great God is? Why would you want ignorant, foolish, shortsighted things to be the judge of something like that? If he's perfect, then he should judge that and be content in his perfection. 

If God is perfect I don't understand why he would want imperfect creatures. He doesn't need us. And if he gives us the ability to choose evil and screw ourselves up for all eternity, but doesn't give us the wisdom and knowledge and perspective that he has on why we shouldn't choose it ever, then it's kind of like he is letting babies burn themselves on the oven, but forever. That seems pretty wrong."

I hope you find some good friends you can talk to. 

In the meantime I would try journaling your thoughts to yourself, because you can use yourself as a sounding board for your thoughts that way. Also, I would try to tell yourself when you're proud of something so that you know you value what you did. And finally, if you find famous people or characters from stories or anyone like that inspiring, think to yourself if they would think what you did was cool. Like if you love a musician, and you also work on some kind of art you do, then you could think to yourself ""musician doesn't give up and always works to express herself and get better. I will too, and that very fact will make me cool like musician."" Or whatever works for you if you don't care about art. 

I would also keep in mind that everyone struggles with self worth to some degree, and realize that you share that struggle in common with lots of people. Some people are more confident at different times but everyone sometimes wonders or feels not good enough. I just say that because I think keeping that in mind helps to not feel alone. You're a part of everything, and you have a lot in common with everyone. You will find someone you can relate to about stuff like this. Be kind to yourself and to others."

It’s better to enter eternal life with only one hand than to go into the unquenchable fires of hell with two hands. 45If your foot causes you to sin, cut it off.

sleep,fglqq6s,t3_ez4vcf,1580908403.0,"I think you can find a lot of general tips anywhere, but just to remind you of things in case you're not thinking of them:

If you feel overwhelmed with school, take some time to write out everything you have to do. Do that on a semester scale, on a week scale, and on a daily scale. On the daily one you can say small things like wake at this time, shower, email Dr. So and so, look over notes for 30 min, class, etc. Then you will feel more in control, and have the satisfaction of checking things off. All big things are built of really small things. Divide and conquer.

Try meditating. I'm not good at it but a lot of people say it helps with stuff like what you're feeling.

Maybe plan to have some time every now and then (every day if you could manage it) for just a couple minutes to listen to calming music and write out stuff that's on your mind and how you're feeling.

If you're really struggling, go to that school health or counseling center and talk to someone about it. It's there for you, the whole time you're a student there. They want to help you. 

Get into a habit of exercise. Once again, it's about regularity, so don't make it a huge thing, just go for short, manageable sessions. It's super good for all parts of your life and can help your body release stress and be tired for sleep.

Go easy on caffeine, or even just cut it out. It can be motivating, sure, but it can also screw with your sleep and your heart rate, and it can dehydrate you.

Listen to lots of calming, chill music. 

Stop looking at screens a little while before bed, and do NOT look at your phone when it's actually time to sleep. The light is telling your body to stay up. Also maybe use more nighttime modes and stuff like f.lux to make your screens emit less blue light. 

Your brain associates certain places with certain activities. Try not to do anything in your bed other than sleep or rest or cuddle. Don't study there, don't eat there, don't play on your phone there. Do that out or at your desk or something.


Good luck! If it gets really bad make sure you reach out for help with actual health and counseling people!"

GameStop and Target are good spots to browse for  game merchandise.

Also, if you don't like that or want to think on it more, just list out all the things she likes: like any animals she thinks are cool/cute, things she likes to do or whatever, shows she's into, her favorite color if she has one, and think about getting something related to one of those things."

They work a surprising amount of times. When you get that awful ""oh shit"" moment when you start to feel your procrastinating catch up with you, use it and go through anything that you know is on your test. It's best if you study properly but even a few minutes going over stuff right before the test can really help.

Always show up to class, even if you are super late and feel embarrassed, and always turn in assignments even if they're incomplete or they suck. 

Also other people have talked about it but I think you have at least low key anxiety. You might want to talk to a counselor at your health center for strategies to help yourself. Also, personally I recommend this: 
find super soothing music (garden state soundtrack is good)
Think about the absolute worst thing that will happen if you fail. Then realize you will still be alive, and could still retake all of college, or find an ok job without college, and your life will not be over and while it would absolutely suck, you can find happiness and success again as long as you are alive. Come to terms with that potential failure so you don't freak out too much to start doing what you need to do to not fail.
Write out what you need to do and break it into small parts. Do each small part and be happy with yourself whenever you get even the smallest thing done, because all big things are built of small things. 

And I agree with other people: send away or delete access to your games. You're addicted to them as a form of escapism. Go out and do social things, especially things you haven't done. Go to free events, go to clubs, volunteer. I think you're maybe in your room too much and trying to escape your school so you're not even present and aware of your day to day life much. Put your games away and look forward to them during your break between semesters. 

Also, look up the last day to withdraw from courses. If, by that day, you're pretty sure there's no way to not fail a course, withdraw so you save your GPA and retake it next semester. 

Don't give up. And don't discount all the things people have said here. Pick at least something someone here said to put into action."

depression,ezpi6ku,t3_d1fxe5,1568041124.0,"First off, I'm really sorry you're depressed and feel awful. I really hope things get better this month.


Have you tried everything you can to make things better? I want to say that I know depression is complicated and can be really hard to fight. I don't mean to tell you you just need to ""get better"" like it's as easy and simple as a snap of your fingers. What I do think is that you haven't described trying some things that COULD potentially help. So if you haven't tried them, maybe you should, and see what happens:


If you tell the right people, they may be able to help. Can you tell your parents, or if you don't feel good about telling them, tell a school counselor? I was once depressed and locked in a bad cycle and telling my parents started me getting out of it. 


Your friends sound like they may be actually making you feel more isolated. Being left out of things really burns. I don't necessarily recommend leaving them but if you could make a new friend who is less worried about looks and not friends with you in a group (a friend you just hang out with one on one), maybe you would feel less alone.


When it comes to pressure from school: do you feel like you have to do really well? You don't. You should keep up, and you should show up, and you should do every assignment. That's the most important part. But you don't have to do a great job at every assignment. C's get degrees. I don't know exactly what school things you're struggling with, but sometimes people with perfectionist tendencies can get into trouble by overwhelming themselves and thinking they need great scores when just passing ones will do. Idk if that helps you at all, I'm just trying to encourage you and relieve a bit of your stress if that possibly applies. 


About your looks. Yes you could work out like crazy and diet and get really good with make up and your hair and you would objectively look better (I have no idea what you look like, but anyone would if they did that). 

But in the end I think the bigger issue is that you're hard on yourself. Unless you have a terrible deformity then I am 100% sure that you have at least a couple beautiful features. Maybe you don't like your stomach, but maybe your eyes are beautiful, or maybe your nose is cute, or maybe your hands are soft, maybe being shorter than your other friends is cute, etc. 

I feel like you're getting caught up in comparing yourself to other people and I get that is easy to do, but I think you'd feel better if you focused on those things you liked about yourself and tell yourself nice things about the way you look. Don't be mean to yourself inwardly. Be gentle. 


And with the future? You aren't there yet. You might change a ton by the time you get to college, if you go that route. College is crazy stressful but can be fun too, and exciting and inspiring. When you get a career it might not be awesome but maybe you'll find something you're ok doing, and then come home and do amazing fun things afterwards. Maybe you'll switch careers and find something better. And then do it again. You just don't know. It might not be so bad. 


Most people I know have been through some depression in high school. It's an especially hard time for a ton of people. Some people's depression lasts afterwards, but a lot of people get through it and come out living fully again. Maybe it could feel hopeful to you to know that.


Good luck harlownelson. I wish you all the best <3"
