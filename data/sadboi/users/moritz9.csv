Sew a patch over the hole from inside the jeans
Lay out your patchwork pattern and fix it together

So first we have Rokko Weissensees first three albums on 2lps, german underground hiphop, excellent. He was btw my nr.1 artist on spotify followed by Pink floyd, the doors, hendrix. Nice old school beats and fantastic adlips.

The Claypool Lennon Delirium from primus bassist Les Claypool and Lennons son sean.
One of the best modern space/psychedelic rock bands. 

The next one should be well known, tools first full album undertow, just fantastic.

The melvins stonerwitch really nice mix of punk/heavy metal and this album is also bit stonie. 

Morphine cure for pain, i just love this record.
Its bluesy rock but without any extras, they dont even have a guitarist, insted some sliding bass lines. 

Songs for the deaf needs no introduction as well as in rainbow and plastic beach. 

The last one is a long strange Trip from the grateful dead, i especially like the studio version of dark star.

Went to the hospitall to saw it up afterwords.

On my first solo backpacking journey through Indonesia I came by a chilled camp in Tetebatu on the foot of Rinjani volcano, with beautiful surrounding of rice fields and jungle. The camp owner was a swiss guy who grew up in Indonesia. I met his father who emigrated to Indonesia and built up a family there, living a simpel live. He invited me to go hiking with him, his family and his dogs, obviously I agreed. And the next day at 3am we started the hike. Going with the locals was a really nice experience for me. We also took two kids (one seen in picture 14yo) from the village with us which are training to become tourguides.  
The hike had quite steep parts in it, but the surroundings were awesome. Wandering through beautiful forest and further up aweasome rock formations and grass areas.  
Us two reached the peak at about lunch. It was the first time for him to get to the top of the mountain, he was quite proud to. The views were amazing, we were quite luckey because often the top is cloudy.

So we went back down and it already started to get dark at again reached the camp at around 7pm, we were all compleatly exhausted.

Two days later the boy came back to the camp with a big poster of the picture you see here."
