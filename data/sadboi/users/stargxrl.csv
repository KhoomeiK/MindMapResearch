I 100% am against Trump and his anti-chinese rhetoric because it promotes racism and xenophobia and puts blame on a large group of innocent people. However, the Chinese government and how it has handled the virus has been far from innocent. I’ve been to and lived in China and I have family members living there right now. Their reported numbers are fake and the systems put in place while necessary, are there for very wrong reasons. They also silenced many doctors and medical staff that first discovered the virus for their own government’s gain.

For example, many members are Asian adoptees with white parents and wanted to meet people that could help them understand their roots a bit more. 

Lastly, I also find that many ethnic/racial organizations do a lot of good, for example many focus on helping promote opportunities or awareness for the community. Many cultural orgs have fundraising/service events based on important issues like in my sorority we raise money for breast cancer research bc Asian women are disproportionally affected.

My whole point is that Ivy League shouldn’t be on a pedestal. If you major in STEM, an Ivy League education is not the golden ticket, for humanities it can prove to be an easier way to find your way into the professional field. 

I chose to go to a public state school on the level of UC Berkeley for a reason, I’m in no way worshipping the ivies, if you weren’t so blinded by your entitlement this whole argument maybe you would’ve realized the point I was trying to make."

To say you can get into any top grad school just because you have a degree from UC Berkeley is an exaggeration. Top graduate programs are extremely competitive for both stem students and humanities students.

If you want to belittle me then I rather not discuss further. I was interested in hearing what you have to say and would hope you’d respect my perspective and explain your understanding in a respectful manner."
unpopularopinion,fmrb3vv,t1_fmraf00,1586318282.0,"UC Berkeley is extremely STEM heavy and has excellent tech programs so their school is not as heavily catered to liberal arts. Most professors at the top of their field that employ the best liberal arts jobs work at Ivy League universities. Look at the most well paid and successful social scientists, historians, journalists, anthropologists and most come from top tier schools. There is definitely a difference even in the number of students who attend a prestigious public school vs prestigious private school. Less students mean more personalized attention and networking opportunities from your professors and affiliates of the university. 

Most of those jobs actually do require some kind of degree (even if unrelated to the job) to make you employable. Also to conclude that someone works a different job after they graduate means that they never intended to find a job related to their major makes no sense. Intention =/= reality which is why in my previous comment I said that some may not get the job they want."

Also looking the two surveys you provided the sample size is extremely small if I’m not mistaken. It’s hard to conclude much about liberal arts degrees just from looking at those surveys. 

Also I’m not sure what point is being made from those two surveys as they show that many students that answered are pursuing graduate school or are employed."
unpopularopinion,fmr84vt,t1_fmr7z5s,1586316150.0,I just find it unlikely that if someone is smart enough or works hard enough to get into an Ivy League (on their own merit of course not bc they’re rich) that they would just go to school just for the heck of it and not intend to do something with their degree.

I also think it’s harder for students to apply from state schools just because a large public school is less likely to help with providing personal attention to its students and helping them with their application or giving opportunities out. 

I think that’s definitely another reason why being a pre-health major at any school has it’s owns struggles and applying to med school is hard for everybody, which is why majoring in prehealth at an ivy vs a state school ends up with the same overall difficulties. If you’re smart enough to get into any med school and get a license to practice at the end, you all make a similar salary."
unpopularopinion,fmr7gsd,t1_fmr69xm,1586315679.0,"Well if you don’t think that liberal arts majors intend to do a job that requires a degree then why would they go to school to get a degree? I don’t think it makes sense that someone would study something for $30,000 a year and intend to work at a low paying, non degree requiring job. I’m not saying all of them end up getting the job they want but they surely all intend to work in a job related to their degree. 

Most jobs nowadays except for blue collar jobs like construction, retail, food service require some kind of a degree. Even if you are applying to a job that is unrelated to your major they still will most likely not hire you unless you have a degree.

EDIT: this was in response to the statement “I don’t think that” you added to your comment after I responded"
unpopularopinion,fmr038d,t1_fmqx5l3,1586310813.0,"I think most people who go to school for a liberal arts degree intend to do some kind of job that requires a degree for instance, doing research in sociology, linguistics or archaeology requires a degree (usually a graduate degree). From what I’ve seen it seems like those research jobs are hard to come by unless you are well connected (like going to a prestigious university). 

More “practical” liberal arts degrees also require some kind of undergrad education to make them more employable such as English/Education or Journalism. I think for journalism it even relies more heavily on connections similar to business/finance majors. Most of my journalism major friends from ivies seem to land internships at big name places like CNN, ABC, etc while my friends from state schools who pursued journalism ended up jobless for 2 years or works “freelance.” 


I’m not 100% sure on all this since I am actually a STEM major but this is just based off of what many of my liberal arts friends from various backgrounds and education levels have told me."
unpopularopinion,fmqudul,t1_fmqnut1,1586307262.0,"I actually kind of partially disagree.

I’ve had friends who gone to ivy leagues and friends who’ve gone to public “irrelevant” state schools who both ended up going to medical school and got a license to practice and they both make the same salary, except one is in huge debt and one isn’t. 

I think it’s a little bit easier to be accepted into medical school if you’re in an ivy, but it’s really the same salary at the end no matter what medical/health school you graduate from. 

For liberal arts if you go to a bad school and study a degree in women studies, communications etc, it’s useless, but I think if you go to an ivy for liberal arts you at least have more connections with the people in the top of their field and have more professional opportunities. Since liberal arts degrees arent employable unless you’re working with the top professionals in your field, having a liberal arts degree from an ivy makes a huge difference from what I’ve seen from personal experience."

AnxietyDepression,fclwxb0,t1_fclw453,1577758469.0,"At my school, dual enrollment was available if you were behind because it fufilled HS graduation requirements. For example, I had a friend who needed to fulfill her math credit and took pre-calculus at the CC and it also counted for her HS graduation. It depends on what classes they offer though. And most CC let’s you take their classes if your SAT/ACT score is high enough for that specific math class. 

I would suggest talking more with your HS counselor and someone at the CC. Also try emphasizing how it would benefit your mental health if you haven’t already. It helped me a lot senior year and now as a freshman at a public state university I don’t have to take a lot of general education classes because my credits transferred (it is saving me $$$ and time). 

Even if they won’t let you do dual enrollment right away and you are behind in graduating, try focusing on taking the classes that you’re behind on at the HS and then fulfilling the rest with dual enrollment so you won’t feel entirely behind even if you graduate a year late.  So even if you graduate a year late you’ll be going into college with lots of credits and still might be able to graduate college on time.

I wish you good luck with the rest of HS and know that a set back in motivation and classes is just temporary. You’ll get to where you want to be even if it might take a bit longer than others."

Have you looked into dual enrollment at a local community college? A lot of high schools offer it and I did it my senior year of high school.

Usually the classes are free if you’re a high school student and instead of taking high school classes you would be taking community college classes (which have a better schedule and can seem less daunting). Also they can cover graduation credits to graduate at lots of high schools and also go towards college credit (at community colleges and public state universities). They also are usually much easier and practical than high school classes. 

It helped me a lot with my own mental health since I was on my own schedule and a much easier schedule than full 8 hour days + was very practical and counted for both HS and college credit. It made me feel more motivated since it was more useful, easier and practical than HS classes."

SeriousConversation,ews4r5e,t3_cpt2qu,1565720160.0,"Interestingly, I’ve had the opposite experiences. Maybe it’s because I live in the Southern region of the US where customer service and general behavior of people in public are a lot more “friendly” and “hospitable” hence “southern hospitality.” 

In Europe, I’ve only traveled to England and thought that the service was not very good compared to the states (at least in the southern/midwestern region because I’ve had shit service in NYC and Cali etc.) People seem to be similar to the US in terms of how they acted in public. I think southern people in the US are even more friendly towards each other if you are in a small town. 

In Asia, I’ve been to Hong Kong, Southern Chinese cities, Thailand, and various other regions and found that the service was the worst there. People in public are equally as rude as Americans but I’ve also had good experiences seeing locals help out tourists. 

I think as Americans we emphasize a lot on customer service in the service industry especially where I live. In other countries they don’t get tips (usually just given a flat percentage amount or they split from a tip pool) which doesn’t give incentive for servers to perform better. Since most of the paycheck for a waiter/waitress is from tips, I have found significantly better service (esp in foods) in the US as compared to any other country. 

BUT this is just my experience and perspective. I think my experience of being in the south changes things as well since the US culture of hospitality ranges from one end to another depending on where you live."
AmItheAsshole,ewekoct,t3_cnirhg,1565327175.0,"YTA, as someone who suffered from major anxiety for a few years while also being in a relationship at the same time this is BEYOND MESSED UP. I know how it feels to have anxiety over stuff like this and I remember at the time that I had major anxiety that if someone told me their social media moves it would help... however a relationship isn’t just about you and what makes sense to you to help you relieve yourself doesn’t mean it’s healthy in a relationship. 

You’re suffering from something that is affecting your relationships and daily life and I think you should work on yourself before being with someone even if you say you “trust her.” Rationally you “trust her” but as someone with anxiety who isn’t rational, you can’t trust until you fix your own mindset and get some help to overcome your own struggles."
SeriousConversation,ew1sy9m,t1_ew1eawg,1565030749.0,That’s true but I also have to really consider the responsibility of owning a firearm. Of course I would need to through proper training to trust myself to use one but it’s also a huge responsibility to carry a firearm or to have one in your house.

SeriousConversation,ew1f956,t1_ew0rqgu,1565022154.0,This is so true. My parents immigrated from a country that is politically unstable and has a lot of violence in this current moment yet there are 0 gun crimes. While other types of violence occurs there guns don’t seem to be a problem
SeriousConversation,ew1esh4,t1_ew0egiu,1565021861.0,"That does make me feel better. I think I’m just an anxious person in general even when it’s against the odds. Sometimes I just feel like everyone says it’s not going to happen to them but it does, so it freaks me out. Especially since there was just a mass shooting in my own town I feel like the odds are still scary. But I get that realistically it is still not very likely."
SeriousConversation,ew1ejkc,t1_ew0ii25,1565021702.0,"That’s exactly how I feel right now and I 100% agree with what you said. I was raised with an ideal vision of the US since my parents have found success after immigrating here for a better life. While yes I feel privileged living in the US, I just feel like if I can move out with my family and I could have a better life elsewhere."
SeriousConversation,ew1dufu,t1_ew0w5qe,1565021250.0,I have always been so opposed to arming myself just because I was raised to avoid any type of weapon but I have to be honest that growing up with an increasing number of mass shootings has made me reconsider possibly learning how to use a gun/own a gun especially in the coming years where I will most likely be living alone.
SeriousConversation,ew1dgi7,t1_ew0vrpq,1565020998.0,There are so many underlying issues surrounding the minds of mass shooters I just wish that we could realistically address all of them as a country.
SeriousConversation,ew1d5vm,t1_ew0ht7e,1565020804.0,"My parents immigrated to the US (legally) and the US has brought a lot of success for us as a family especially avoiding a country where people are simply arrested/killed for publishing something against the government. But as I grow older, I think about moving elsewhere because of how unsafe these mass shootings seem along with other political/moral issues that our lawmakers neglect."

SeriousConversation,ew0cv66,t1_ew0ci6i,1564983615.0,I understand that other countries have it way worse and I do know how the “real world” looks like. My family is from a currently politically unstable country so I understand that other countries experience even more violence on a larger degree. But I posted because I have my own anxieties for where I live now. I never said I wanted to “move to any other country” I just said that this specific fear of mine makes me want to move somewhere else where there are less gun related crimes. Every country has its problems and I get that but I’m just experiencing a lot of fear regarding the country I’m in right now especially when a mass shooting had just recently occurred 20 minutes away from my house at a university that my friends and family both attend/attended.
unpopularopinion,ev7sl9s,t1_ev7qnb1,1564263806.0,You make a good point and I agree but I think for the sake of efficiency we should just make a dresscode and enforce it the same on everyone or make everybody wear uniforms. It’s hard to “measure” how much of a distraction something is to a girl vs a guy so I think when creating rules they should just have it apply to everyone so nobody gets distracted. It saves the trouble of having to address double standards and saves the trouble of people arguing what should be deemed a “distraction” and what isn’t.
unpopularopinion,ev7ryj2,t1_ev7qyve,1564263573.0,I went to a school in the southern United States. Many schools are not as strict as mine but our dress code didn’t allow leggings or girls to wear anything above the knee. It was definitely ridiculous. I’m not making any of this information up and I’d rather not comment unless I felt that I had an interesting perspective to add to the conversation.
unpopularopinion,ev7op45,t1_ev7o011,1564262356.0,That’s very true. But I’ve seen guys come in with sporty tank tops at schools where girls aren’t even allowed to show their shoulders. And while this is not very common I’ve also seen boys with very short shorts and not get dresscoded while girls who wear athletic running shorts for PE and get sent home to change. It just seems that some schools have a double standard on how they enforce it on girls vs boys.
unpopularopinion,ev7k1fa,t3_cim8t7,1564260708.0,"I think people tend to shift the blame on men on this because school administrators will take the girl out of class and have her find clothes to change into which then takes a whole chunk out of their class time (they have to call home for alt clothes) while telling them that their clothes “take away from boy’s learning.” And not only that I’ve seen some cases where boys wear tank tops and shorts that are breaking the “girl’s dress code” and are not ever dresscoded which creates a double standard. Having an all around dress code is fine but the way schools enforce it is so focused on girls it becomes a gender issue. + I’ve seen arguments of people saying that because there are lesbian and bi students that can control themselves, boys should too."

I don’t know your biological sex so this information may not be helpful but I’ve also heard that pregnancy symptoms can be similar to HIV symptoms or just any sudden change to your body.
AmItheAsshole,erolzz3,t3_c2oyc4,1561082524.0,"YTA, I am close with my parents who ACTUALLY RAISED ME and I still haven’t come out to them. Yet I came out to my sister and my cousins. My parents aren’t straight up homophobic either. Coming out is not an alltogether process. The experience of being LGBTQ means you come out constantly over and over again in your life to everyone because it isn’t “normal” to be LGBTQ. I constantly have to correct others and find myself coming out to new people wherever I go and feel comfortable to do so. And that is something I do on MY OWN CHOICE. If he doesn’t want to come out to you it’s his choice and you should leave it. Especially since you weren’t very present in his life to begin with."
RandomKindness,ep8tm7l,t1_ep64nff,1559099738.0,Actually I think it would help if I talked to someone older. I feel like part of my anxiety and problems with grief is linked to a fear of aging and time passing. I’m so sorry you lost your husband and that it’s around the time where things get anxious for you. I’d be happy to talk if you are still willing to chat with me. :)

niceguys,eog92v0,t3_bromzv,1558553222.0,As someone who’s actually a “gamer” I am frequently at GameStop and similar instances have happened to me multiple times. I don’t know why but niceguys who are “gamers” are constantly inside of GameStops seeking out women who like games because they are so desperate to find one that shares their interest. It’s pathetic.
