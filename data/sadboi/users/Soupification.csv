Christianity,fqnxjf1,t3_gjwx8d,1589503376.0,"Taken straight from Wikipedia:   
The **Galileo affair** ([Italian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_language): *il processo a Galileo Galilei*) began around 1610 and culminated with the trial and condemnation of [Galileo Galilei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Galilei) by the [Roman Catholic Inquisition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Inquisition) in 1633. Galileo was prosecuted for his support of [heliocentrism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism), the [astronomical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy) model in which the [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth) and planets revolve around the [Sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun) at the centre of the [Solar System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System).

In 1610, Galileo published his [*Sidereus Nuncius*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidereus_Nuncius) (*Starry Messenger*), describing the surprising observations that he had made with the new [telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telescope), among them, the [Galilean moons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galilean_moons) of [Jupiter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter). With these observations and additional observations that followed, such as the [phases of Venus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phases_of_Venus), he promoted the heliocentric theory of [Nicolaus Copernicus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolaus_Copernicus) published in [*De revolutionibus orbium coelestium*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_revolutionibus_orbium_coelestium) in 1543. Galileo's discoveries were met with opposition within the Catholic Church, and in 1616 the Inquisition declared heliocentrism to be ""formally heretical."" Heliocentric books were banned and Galileo was ordered to abstain from holding, teaching or defending heliocentric ideas.

Galileo went on to propose a theory of [tides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tide) in 1616, and of comets in 1619; he argued that the tides were evidence for the motion of the Earth. In 1632 Galileo published his [*Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialogue_Concerning_the_Two_Chief_World_Systems), which implicitly defended heliocentrism, and was immensely popular. Responding to mounting controversy over [theology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theology), [astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy) and [philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy), the [Roman Inquisition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Inquisition) tried Galileo in 1633 and found him ""vehemently suspect of [heresy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heresy)"", sentencing him to [indefinite imprisonment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indefinite_imprisonment). Galileo was kept under house arrest until his death in 1642.  
This man was sentenced to life imprisonment because he figured out that the Earth revolved around the Sun. Thank you church for always helping out scientific advances. :D"
