I always navigated life on how I felt, if it didn't feel good I would just pick another path, its not about being perfect, but feeling good (including the good, the bad and the ugly), like you are learing and growing. 
Its crazy cause during the hardest times of my life they all felt good. Felt like I was learning, that is like part of the process, like something I agreed before I came to this life. That's is how I see it and works for me..."
