AsianParentStories,fqgc182,t3_gimhko,1589342538.0,"The fact that you had the courage to pursue what you wanted says a lot and you should be proud of the career path you chose. I don't know if your mom was against you becoming a teacher but I also want to become one and my parents are also against it, saying I don't fit the role and that ""anyone can teach"". AP will talk shit regardless of the career path you choose,even if it's being a doctor. Mothers also view their sons as their ""baby"" and that's just how it is, but it doesn't mean she loves you any less. They just view being a doctor as top tier for some weird reason. Either way you should be proud and don't worry because you already won the battle."

AsianParentStories,flspcl4,t3_fqmarz,1585447483.0,I relate to this a lot. I feel like it turned me into such an angry person and the more you don't want to be like someone the more you become them. Its so hard not to be angry when your environment is like that 24/7. I just try to take a minute and breathe when I feel the anger boil inside of me
