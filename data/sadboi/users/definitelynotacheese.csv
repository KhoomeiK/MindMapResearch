tipofmytongue,fgm1ty9,t3_ezb393,1580916246.0,Something about its face?
gatesopencomeonin,fefuacz,t1_fe06tny,1579065413.0,That's what I appreciates about you
AskReddit,fefrzdj,t3_eou6il,1579063457.0,I had terrible anxiety as a child (still do). I hoped not to make it to adulthood so I wouldn't have to deal with it. I'm down for that tbh.
AskReddit,fc7f5ag,t3_egi52s,1577505572.0,What did I just eat?
NewOrleans,fc20apa,t1_fc2059t,1577335478.0,That's actually really impressive
NewOrleans,fc1yzhl,t3_efqcqv,1577334178.0,"God can you imagine how painstaking that is? Having to wrap the lights *just so*

ETA that I very much appreciate the effort and beauty"
depression,fbcsjw3,t3_ecb4lx,1576732470.0,Constantly. Even during the day sometimes
bigboobproblems,fazsqsk,t3_eattlo,1576419296.0,YOU. LOOK. FABULOUS. Just wanted to make sure you knew
AskDoctorSmeeee,fazshcy,t1_fayb29g,1576419208.0,"NAD but you could also go see ENT. The hoarseness is the symptom that sticks out to me, especially if it's long-term and not paired with laryngitis"
AskReddit,famalhj,t1_falgaa2,1576199583.0,"I have experienced orgasmic migraines. Can confirm, they are excruciating. I scared the everliving shit out of my husband when I grabbed my head and started screaming. Felt like a horrible, horrible lightning bolt."
AskReddit,fadvy8g,t1_facvaw4,1575987756.0,Tbh I trust someone who is willing to do some research to make sure they're doing it right over someone who just chooses a direction and follows through come hell or high water.
fatlogic,ewfez2e,t1_ewfexzx,1565359229.0,You're welcome
fatlogic,eweeb54,t1_ewedz26,1565321527.0,Avenue Q has a great song about that..
AskDoctorSmeeee,eu8wjiw,t1_eu8wfim,1563566318.0,I had it once and remember it being itchy. I don't know that it has to be though
AskDoctorSmeeee,eu8w5iz,t3_cf9ijp,1563566070.0,"NAD, but is it itchy? It almost looks like a ring worm"
C25K,eu8cgmn,t3_cf6b8e,1563554335.0,DUUUUUDE I feel you on the humidity of SE LA. I can only force myself to run at night lately so as not to die horribly. Looks like a really nice run though!
SelfAwarewolves,etryy8w,t1_etry8g5,1563132379.0,"Me too, my dude"
SelfAwarewolves,etrxnwm,t1_etrxble,1563131474.0,"Yeah, we have plenty of all that. Ugh. Just. Ugh."
SelfAwarewolves,etrx0k3,t1_etru5sk,1563131024.0,"I think you misspelled ""terrible."" We're like a country run by drunken toddlers that also have dementia."
fatlogic,etqfpu9,t1_etpa2xt,1563083144.0,"I think it is too. I'm not special, I didn't take the easy way. I'm down 73 lbs and it's on me to keep going until goal. Same with everyone else."
fatlogic,et9sd79,t3_cal6rc,1562604321.0,"Oh, honey. When was the last time you had a bowel movement? Because you are FULL OF SHIT."
fatlogic,et7xecm,t1_et7voeh,1562540696.0,"Well, the example that is at the top of my mind is in the ER. We try to weigh people upon arrival. This comes in extremely handy if things take a nosedive and the pt needs to be intubated. And while the vast majority of ER visits do not go this way (many use the ER as their PCP), there is no way to guarantee that it *won't* happen"
depression,esp3tm6,t1_esp3mgx,1562178494.0,"Thank you. I feel like I couldn't do that to my parents and husband, but I'm afraid of my own brain right now."
SelfAwarewolves,esoztbd,t1_esokl7y,1562176780.0,Not just interesting. Absolutely fascinating. The pulmonary edema in particular. Thank you so much for sharing that.
AskReddit,es43mpw,t1_es2zpju,1561576394.0,"For me it's my grandmother's rice dressing. It was perfect, and no one can figure out exactly what she did differently. My guess is the missing ingredient is how much she loved us, we could feel it while we ate and her particular accent (agressively Cajun) is always echoing in the back of our minds when we try to imitate the recipe."
fatlogic,erzgj6e,t1_erzghmz,1561435166.0,Thank you!
fatlogic,erzg2j6,t1_erzfrzm,1561434742.0,It makes perfect sense how you say it. I'm 12 lbs over the overweight threshold right now but I would like to lose 30 more total and I always get strange looks when I say that I'm 30 lbs overweight so I wasn't sure what all that really meant. Thank you for your explanation
fatlogic,erzeafa,t1_erxv6y8,1561433170.0,"Ok I have a question I've been wondering about for a while but I've been too scared to ask. When someone says they're 10 lbs overweight, does that mean 10 lbs above the overweight threshold or 10 lbs over their target weight?I have no idea how to describe where I am vs the range I should be and the actual weight I want to be."
fatlogic,eru2375,t1_eru1huy,1561260486.0,"The bore of the scanners (MRI, CT, PET) are pretty much totally smooth for ease of cleaning. Lubing someone up might work if it's reeeeeaaaally close but if it's too tight the pt won't even get in."
fatlogic,eru1fbj,t1_eru0zqw,1561259860.0,"I literally got called in my boss's office recently bc I got a 4/5 on a survey for wait time. I had the test done within 8 minutes of it being ordered. Being good at your job is no longer enough, you have to be omnipotent."
AskReddit,erob6uf,t1_ermp4bi,1561073944.0,Working the overnight tonight in radiology. Agreed it gets super creepy at night. Especially bc I work alone. I end up hanging out in the ER a lot.
fatlogic,erkv8ad,t1_erkv17t,1560972187.0,"All told, it only took about 15 extra minutes to do it the old fashioned way. Not too terrible and the lawn doesn't look too bad either. Granted, my fancy lawnmower is a non propelled electric"
fatlogic,erku8rs,t1_erktodw,1560971554.0,Oh there are approximately 1 million other reasons to leave Louisiana. The heat is just the very edge of the issue. Congratulations on getting out!
fatlogic,erks7tz,t3_c2ia8x,1560970249.0,"Wanna get a really good workout in? It's easy! Be like me, forget to charge the batteries on your electric lawn mower. Then, when the grass grows to about mid-shin, decide that you're gonna mow the lawn at 1pm in June in South Louisiana. Realize that your only option is the old fashioned mower you bought a couple of years ago on a whim. You'll sweat buckets. Promise!"
fatlogic,erka5az,t1_erk47i5,1560958884.0,Had a pt a few years ago that tore his Achilles stepping off a curb. Agreed-sometimes it's just shit luck.
antiMLM,er5dqrl,t1_er4zdou,1560523902.0,Thank you!!
antiMLM,er471jb,t3_bvmc2h,1560482734.0,This is a saddening and fascinating read. Would you mind if I include your experience in a research paper I'm writing on the predatory nature of MLMs and why they should be illegal or at least more strictly regulated?
askscience,eqcfm8m,t1_eqc6rgr,1559968509.0,I did a little research because of this show. A lethal dose is 500 roentgens delivered over 5 hours. It's estimated that at the time of explosion the core was emitting 5.6 roentgens per *second*. Meaning that the first responders received a lethal dose within 90 seconds. Blows my fucking mind.
fatlogic,eotnd9g,t3_bsvjf1,1558844438.0,"Well I just went on an extremely eventful run. Soupy air, sore legs, ouchy ankle, I nearly ate pavement while listening to a song called Road Rash, and I almost kidnapped someone's dog. 
Best mood I've been in for weeks."
