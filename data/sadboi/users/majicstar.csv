Some people also do self harm for attention. But as I previously said, others have a true problem and can't really help it do to how their mind works. I never said they choose to restrict, starve, purge, binge, or anything of that nature."
EatingDisorders,ff47dqa,t3_erbkfg,1579557155.0,"Eating disorders are super super tricky. Some do it for attention, while others have true body dysmorphia and literally can't see themselves how they truly are. Ultimately though, just like with many other problems it'll only get better if they want to get better. This can be hard if they don't see a problem. Maybe if you two are close, I'd sit down with her and have a real conversation with just you two. Show her pictures of how she used to look versus now. Express your serious serious concern for her life and health because she'll die if its as bad as you say. Then maybe she'll want to do it for you if she still can't do it for herself. If not, and she's selfish due to the dysmorphia there's not much to do for her since she's an adult and she can't be forced into a clinic or something"
EatingDisorders,fe392ia,t3_enm6ht,1578847134.0,"In situations like this it's tricky. You need to explain gently by saying, I care about you but it's hard to support you when I'm still learning how to support myself. If they are really your friend they'll respect your emotional boundaries set to avoid being triggered"
EatingDisorders,fal86h1,t1_faa56kf,1576180016.0,That's so terrible. You deserve help and support!
