Little girls wanting nice dresses and tea parties comes from, for the most part, how she's raised by her parents. This comment just seems so absurd and I'm struggling to unpick it.  Like just because the mom is girly it doesn't mean the daughter will be too. I don't understand the logic behind this at all. You make it sound like parents socialise with their kids in the same way they do with other adults. I like make up but I can't have a conversation with my 5 year old niece about fenty or some shit. Her playing with make up is more like her stealing my $25 lipstick and smashing it into pieces. 

Kids are their own people, they all have their own personalities and differences regardless of gender. The differences really start to emerge during teenage years but a large proportion of teenagers are difficult once again, regardless of gender. 

This isn't about an individual thinking that raising their son was easier than their daughter, it's about a common view that sons in general are easier to raise than daughters.

It's not easy to see guys struggling because of toxic masculinity just as isn't not easy to see women struggle as a result of it.

I have seen some comments which I do think come from a place of ignorance where they're seeing it in a very black and white, binary manner. But the point of this sub is gender orientated and so people are only discussing how gender plays a part.
