jawsurgery,fpapj2q,t3_gbz99w,1588453023.0,"I had a genioplasty revision done with him and he didn‚Äôt listen to anything I said and while recovering I could tell that the bone was not moved forward enough, I told him it needs to be revised and moved forward more, he said it was just due to swelling. Low and behold when I recovered it definitely wasn‚Äôt moved forward enough and I had a lot of loose skin that was unsupported by the bone. 

I personally wouldn‚Äôt go to him for any revisions. Because he is the type of surgeon that thinks he knows what‚Äôs best no matter what and doesn‚Äôt really take patient input. He has a structure he follows and he doesn‚Äôt make exceptions. However my case was unique. 

I‚Äôm actually still very upset about the whole situation because I paid 16k out of pocket for the surgery and it didn‚Äôt resolve anything. It was literally a useless surgery. And then he tried to say that the reason we did not get the correct result is because my double jaw surgery was done incorrectly and he tried to use this as an excuse for me to have a double jaw surgery revision with him. However my double jaw surgery was done well. It‚Äôs very clear if you look at my x-rays. The fact that he brought this up after the revision was already done was just silly. He should have mentioned it before if it were really the reason. 

I do see many people get great results from him though and he is very precise with was he doesn‚Äôt, he does a lot of measurements and determines exactly what is going wrong and so forth. However I would not consider him for any revisions. I wish I could say otherwise because in some ways he seems very professional. It‚Äôs just that my case was completely a waste of time and money."

anhedonia,fme8r4f,t1_fme7zfl,1585994210.0,"That‚Äôs amazing to hear and it‚Äôs definitely a unique perspective you have compared to most who have tried psychedelics. 

DMT is sinister, it‚Äôs makes you believe that you are God in many ways or it transports you directly into the astral plane where spiritual entities can basically plays tricks on your mind. You‚Äôre completely open, it‚Äôs like giving your mind up to the astral plane. Since ayahuasca is dmt I would expect the trip to have some similarities. When I took Ayahuasca it didn‚Äôt effect me in anyway and I took twice as much. I still have no idea why this is but I can only assume that God was protecting my spirt because everybody else was in an extreme trip, DMT was partially the same experience. However reality did turn into fractals and I merged with it all and then ended up in a void. 

I would be interested in hearing about how your experiences with psychedelics have brought you closer to God. Maybe dm me directly since it‚Äôs a bit off topic here. 

One thing about shrooms is that it revealed truths to me that were undeniable. It was as if knowing something with complete knowingness that there was no way to doubt it, it was as if every truth revealed to me on shrooms came from the source of truth which was none other then God. 

And I can relate in a way to what you mean about heaven, I experienced it in some ways as well.

I guess in all these experiences we are essentially entering a spiritual realm to some degree and if we have believe in God then he takes us on a unique journey and if you‚Äôre agnostic or atheist then it‚Äôs another unique journey that is either orchestrated by God or angels masquerading as light. 

These drugs are almost like s direct link to the soul where as most times in order to get that connection in the flesh we need to fast."

There is still the possibility that some kind of alien or alternative God is ruling this planet and basically created the Bible as a means to control people. But seeing that my life experiences all completely align with the Bible and the Bible literally reads back to you when you read it and I have been attacked by demons that were rebuked in the name of Jesus and that the Holy Spirit definitely is a real spirit and does exactly what it says it does in the Bible then it‚Äôs hard to deny that it must be the truth or at least point to some form of truth. 

Christianity has the Bible which is the same and never changing. Psychedelics on the other hand offer varying experiences. I think if you‚Äôre trying to put your foundation of belief on anything then it has to be the Bible which is deemed the word of God because it‚Äôs consistent and doesn‚Äôt change but with psychedelics you literally have no idea what is happening. You don‚Äôt know if what you experience is another realm, a dysfunction in the brain from a chemical imbalance. There‚Äôs no word or confirmation on any of it to back it up. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, psychedelics offer such a strong truth that hits the soul directly but I have also experienced this when in direct communication with God in the spirit. The thing is demons know you better then your self as well because they see your spirit, of course they will offer you truth as well and then sprinkle in some deception. I think anything that comes in from the spirit is portrayed as direct truth because there‚Äôs nothing above it except God to weed out any lie. This is why the word of God stands and gives you something to test the spirits against. Psychedelics have no way to test the spirits or even confirm what is happening and this is where it only makes sense to choose the Word over psychedelics. 

Besides the Book of Enoch explains how the fallen angels taught humans how to make psychedelics and psychedelic most definitely contain the original lie from the garden in their experiences.

The 2nd chapter seems to state that things were created differently then the first but I believe the 2nd chapter is referring specifically to what was brought into the Garden of eden, however everything else already existed on the earth and was part of the original creation story. 

It‚Äôs impossible for God to be imperfect because he would set the scale for perfection as there‚Äôs nothing above him to define what perfection is otherwise. 

As for our sins and the fallen world. It makes sense that it had to happen in order for us to have any form of freewill. 

In my experience, if any belief system is true then it has to be Christianity because I swear that everything I have experienced aligns perfectly with the Bible but I still have a hard time with how much of a fallen world we live in.

The lake of fire is a spiritual place and that is why it‚Äôs called the 2nd death. The dead are resurrected in spirit and judged in spirit, God is spirit. Sin is committed within time so punishment must be within time if it‚Äôs a just punishment. We sin against God but we sin within time and therefore punishement cannot be eternal. 

The result of sin is death, that‚Äôs the end all of existence and this alone is very clear. 

‚ÄúFor God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life‚Äù. 

John 3:16 

It‚Äôs very clear. Jesus sacrificed himself to give us eternal life because the alternative is to perish and perish means that you cease to exist. So either Jesus existed and this is a true statement or it‚Äôs a lie or it‚Äôs a mistranslation. The Bible in its original languages do not talk about hell whatsoever. 

I won‚Äôt debate this anymore. For some reason some Christians find joy in promoting and believing in Hell.

Sin is darkness so by participating in sin then we are inviting darkness in our life and pushing God, the light out. The cleaner we are then the more God is able to work through us. 

This is why me must stay in his word to continuously renew our mind. 

But everybody is right. It‚Äôs not about being perfect or focusing on your sins, but it‚Äôs about wanting God and trying to draw nearer to him and always striving for a better relationship with him. 

Ultimately God is the highest and best choice we can make, but it‚Äôs kind of like trying to eat vegetables as a kid when you‚Äôll rather eat cereal. Basically the Bible is the nutrient manual and when you read it you realize that following him is what‚Äôs good for your eternal life, where as if you eat the cereal too often then you will not be able to nourish your body with God‚Äôs Love and your life will be cut short. It doesn‚Äôt mean the blood of Jesus cannot cleanse you of all those years of eating cereal but typically it‚Äôs best to just not eat it at all. 

The same is true for God. A parent isn‚Äôt going to kick a kid out of their house for eating cereal Over their vegetables but you‚Äôre not going to be in the parents favor if you don‚Äôt take their advice and in this sense the parent cannot be in agreement with you and willfully lay out other beneficial things for you in your life because regardless you will not heed to them. 

So it‚Äôs ultimately not about avoiding sin. It‚Äôs about making wise choices and knowing that God truly knows what‚Äôs best for you. So you follow his will only because it‚Äôs perfect, not because you are perfect or trying to be perfect. 

Honestly. Probably the best way to see it is like a diet. Nobody is always going to be perfect on their diet, people are going to fall off but if we do fall off then we might as well enjoy it but the point is we know we will fall off but we also always know we will get back on. We don‚Äôt need to blame ourselves for not following through with the diet at all times. That‚Äôs why God judges the heart. Basically it doesn‚Äôt matter how many times you fall off, if you heart is always striving to stay on the diet or get back on it and you are always coming to God then you‚Äôre pretty much in the clear. But if you‚Äôre always intentionally falling off and basically living in sweets, fats, deserts, etc then your heart may still be with good intentions but you‚Äôre going to develop heart disease and God is not going to allow that into his kingdom. Keep your heart pure and consistently strive for him. Sin, go out and sin. Allow yourself to sin and at least enjoy it when you do but don‚Äôt ever sit in sin. Repent and come back to the father."
TrueChristian,fkvq43q,t1_fkuei2f,1584574379.0,"He‚Äôs saying take it or cease to exist forever after death. It‚Äôs either eternal life or eternal death. 

I won‚Äôt get on a debate on hell but I will certainly tell you that the Bible doesn‚Äôt teach it as external torment in fire, if you truly read and study the scriptures you will realize this. 

I will also tell you that if it does exist then it completely violates the freewill that God ordained to us. The result of sin is death, not death and then life in eternal torment of fire. The result of sin is death. Period. This is death of the flesh and death of the soul. That‚Äôs why the lake of fire and brimstone is referred to the 2nd death as it‚Äôs the death of the soul. Death is the lack of life and nobody can be tormented if they are dead to experience it."

What‚Äôs happening for people that are experiencing anhedonia is that their body is stuck in fight or flight and it‚Äôs nearly impossible to feel emotions when stuck in this state. 

The cure has to do with determining what is keeping your body stuck in this state, it could be stress, lack of sleep, diet, inflammation, trauma, ptsd, high anxiety, heavy metal toxicity, etc. once you find the root cause and take care of that then your body will come back into balance and you‚Äôll start feeling emotions again..

jawsurgery,fkouvqr,t1_fkohdmz,1584395528.0,"It‚Äôs not pstosis because it has to do with how the skin is supported by the bone.

So now I have excess skin that is not supported by the bone, which leaves me with two options, either advance the bone to support the skin once again or to excise the skin. However I typically have a beard so if I excise too much skin it will move my beard lower on the front of the chin so the best option for me is to do a balance between advancement and skin excision via a submental chin tuck. But I‚Äôm having a hard time on determining how much I should advance the chin so i‚Äôm looking for second opinions.

From my experiences I can attest that all of my experiences with God align completely with what the Bible says. I still have doubts that God exist but for me it‚Äôs more likely that he exist then does not based on the things I‚Äôve experienced.

I think this answer may be helpful to read. I don‚Äôt want to try to convince anybody he exist but it‚Äôs pretty much the most logical explanation for our existence. Because something needed to exist before time in order to bring us into existence or perhaps time in itself doesn‚Äôt exist and this is all some sort of illusion and we don‚Äôt even exist that‚Äôs a much bigger stretch though. The most logical and reasonable explanation is that God exist or we don‚Äôt know based on the data we have but we most certainly cannot say he doesn‚Äôt exist with any type of certainly. That‚Äôs why to be an atheist is the equivalent of putting yourself in place of God as if all is known. But some could say the say about a believer.

anhedonia,fkjrbkf,t3_firdy6,1584256164.0,"The Void along with the fact that we are here proves the existence of God. 

A personal relationship with God is the only thing that can fill the void. It‚Äôs the only thing, science cannot not explain this void away. Even if science came up with a explanation for everything that made logical sense and let‚Äôs say it was correct, the void would still be there. That is the exact reason why there is no way to scientifically explain our existence. We simply exist because God made us and God does not exist in time so asking the question ‚Äúwho made God?‚Äù isn‚Äôt even applicable. He didn‚Äôt have to be made, he always existed because he isn‚Äôt just the beginning and end, he is I Am and the beginning and end 

The one thing that fills the void in this world is Love. 

God is Love. We are meant to live in the presence of God and since we do not, this is why the void exist. 

Sex and money make the world go around because people are constantly looking for Love. They think it‚Äôs sex that fulfills them but it‚Äôs not, it‚Äôs just that sex is the closest expression of love and bonding with one another and the only reason people strive to make money is because they believe it will lead to more opportunities to feel bonding, significance and ultimately love. 

Love makes the world go around. Everything we do is in hope for love. We live for Love and our will to live is based on the hope of Love. Love is everything and God is Love. 

The opposite of Love is the void. 

We want to look up at the sky and stars in Love, we want to fall in love with work, we want to love where we live, love how we look, love ourselves, love others, love our friends, family, we want to be in love with everything. That is the ultimate expression of life and that is the purpose of life but this world is broken because we have the knowledge of good and evil. So we have the knowledge of Love and the void. 

Love fills the void and the only way to access true unconditional love is through God. He will fill the void for eternity. This world however can only temporarily fill it and typically the more we‚Äôre filled with it in this world then the more the void when we lost it. 

If you know Love then you know God. But God‚Äôs love is the great love of all, because it‚Äôs completely unconditional. No love from the world can compare. 

God is pure Love and light, however he has a conscious and personality like us. He simply is Love and God had so much love in him that he wanted to be able to share this great emotion with others. He made us so that he can love us. Thats literally the only reason we exist. Love is the reason why we are here. 

If you ever felt true love or intense love then you will see that everything else is perfected in it. Our body works best when we are in love, everything works so well when we‚Äôre in Love. Love takes away pain, it resolves all issues. Nothing is greater then Love. 

God exist, because Love exist and we exist. God is Love. Lack of love is the void. Grow a personal relationship with God and this Void will disappear."

As a recommendation I would suggest spending time reading the word, not listening to it because when you read it you can meditate on it and it‚Äôs hard to do that when listening to it. God tells us to mediate on his word day and night. Trust me this alone will help you tremendously.

Romans 8:28 

‚ÄúAnd we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who[a] have been called according to his purpose‚Äù. 

He does not put evil upon us but he uses that evil to draw us in. Job is a perfect example of how God works. Job was a good servant but he was prideful."
TrueChristian,fk9eh4w,t1_fk8yqso,1583974425.0,"Ones of the greatest things about God is that he is always with us and will never forsake us. 

So what we felt is actually accessible to us at all times but it‚Äôs our hardened heart and our sinful nature that prevents it from being experienced at all times. But it is possible to walk in the spirit and experience his love for most of the day. 

There have been times before bed where I talk to him and it‚Äôs pretty much like having a conversation, but like you said it‚Äôs not an exchange of words, it‚Äôs all felt in the heart and I have flashes, it‚Äôs visual too. I even have laughed with God, he showed me his sense of humor. It was hilarious. Because I tried to bargain with him and make promises which I knew I couldn‚Äôt keep but then he showed me that he knew I wasn‚Äôt going to keep my word and then I admitted to him and myself ‚Äúalright, you got me, I‚Äôm over here trying to bargain with you and you know everything, but it was a good try huh?

TrueChristian,fk8py1a,t3_fgvgeb,1583960669.0,"I had a similar experience. 

When it happened to me all I can do is cry and I fell down to my knees and my hands automatically raised in worship and I asked myself why they are up and should I put them down but I couldn‚Äôt get myself to actually take the action to put them down. They just stayed up and I kept on crying. 

Then what I would say was thousands of messages entered my heart, many came within visions and flashing light. Much of the messages couldn‚Äôt be explained in words but they were known in spirit and a layer of hardness from my heart was lifted. 

The messages that were most clear to me is that I will persevere and I will be a prophet for God. I had visions of myself preaching to others in the future. 

I had multiple experiences like this. One time I asked myself if I will ever have a family and felt pretty sad about that question because I felt like the answer was a no. But then I felt such a strong presence of the holy spirit flash over me and hand a vision of me passing a football with a future wife and son, once that vision flashed then I broke down in tears and got chills throughout my whole entire body. 

Just yesterday I was feeling completely defeated but I pushed myself to go to the gym. I was feeling burned out and completely unmotivated to workout but I went anyways. As soon as I started running then I felt the presence of the Holy Spirit all over my body and within a few minutes I literally felt as if angels were surrounding me and I felt that they were lifting me up and cheering me on to keep on running and to push through the workout. I began to feel that it wasn‚Äôt me running anymore, but it was the Holy Spirit running for me. That ended up being the longest run I did in over a month and I wanted to keep on running but my shirt was so soaked in sweat that it was getting really uncomfortable to continue and the presence of the spirit began to fade. For a short while I could see and sense spirits around other people. It was a pretty intense experience. 

A lot of this seems like it can be made up in the heads but I‚Äôve had very direct revelations from God and events that occurred that can not be explained outside of God. So I do truly believe what I experienced is exactly what I believed it to be. I truly believe that God spoke directly to me and that his angels truly did lift me up. Check out psalms 91, it speaks of angels lifting us up."
anhedonia,fk6qfjo,t1_fk6oj8k,1583911611.0,Thank you brother. I truly wish the best for you with anhedonia and any type of depression you are facing. I mean this from my heart personally. Our beliefs differ but I do hope you find healing.
PrayerTeam_amen,fk6mhlc,t3_fgqoih,1583907038.0,"You must read the word over and over again each and every day. Live in the word. Prayers are not going to deliver you but the word will. 

‚ÄúFor the word of God is living and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the division of soul and spirit, and of joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.‚Äù

I will pray for you."
anhedonia,fk6jf3l,t1_fk6iuyz,1583903971.0,"I would die for the God written on those pages, would you die for man? That‚Äôs where our beliefs differ. I know the truth in my spirit and you have no truth in man. You think you do but it‚Äôs not worthy of death, because man can offer nothing beyond death. 

Regardless of your answer, being an atheist is very naive. It puts man above all things but man can‚Äôt even save themselves from themselves. If you were being honest you‚Äôre not an atheist, the true answer is you don‚Äôt know and that‚Äôs basically what an atheist is but they deny God instead of just saying they don‚Äôt know. They intentionally deny God because they tend to hate God and that‚Äôs usually due to life circumstances that they blame God for. I‚Äôm not saying this applies to all atheist, but many. So many atheist have such a strong hatred towards God or people in general. You know I harbored much hate for a long time and it gave me anhedonia, it wasn‚Äôt till I started loving more that I began to come out of it. I‚Äôm not saying this is how you got it but that was the case for me and some others I have spoken to."
ptsd,fk6hxsi,t1_fk607pb,1583902674.0,"Awesome, I‚Äôm glad this can help you. 

As for PTSD, what is ptsd to God? He created practically an infinite universe and he is an infinite being. His power has no limits, he can heal you instantly, literally instantly he can heal you. 

Do you know why he doesn‚Äôt? 

It‚Äôs not because he doesn‚Äôt want to. He wants to give you everything. He Loves you but he always wants you to be with him forever and ever so that he can love you for all eternity and this is why he has not healed you, because he is using your pain to bring you closer to him and to purify you and once he knows you are purified completely and his instantaneous healing of your ptsd will not alter your walk with him and your salvation in him then that is precisely when he will heal you completely of it. 

Walk with him and be in him fully so that he can be with you fully and you will see that though you may walk in pain for a little while, your pain will be set free as soon as he has you locked in for eternity. Because he loves you and for this reason he wants you around forever and ever more. This is how the Lord works. 

People don‚Äôt understand it, they wonder why they aren‚Äôt healed and they think God doesn‚Äôt work miracles. Trust me, you will be free indeed but you must stamp your place in eternity. He‚Äôs not going to heal you if it‚Äôs going to prevent you from being saved."
