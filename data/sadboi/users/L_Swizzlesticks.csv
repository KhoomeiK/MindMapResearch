 This is Jeremy & Audrey Roloff‚Äôs podcast (they‚Äôre the ones that left the TLC show Little People, Big World). At first I didn‚Äôt mind it. It was kind of fun and relatable because they‚Äôre my age and going through a lot of the same life phases. But then it shifted focus into being centred almost solely around religion. These two are self-centered, arrogant, and incredibly closed-minded. If you‚Äôre an evangelist Christian, you‚Äôll probably love it. Otherwise, skip this one.

‚Ä¢ Irish History Podcast

I actually really like this podcast and plan on subscribing again at some point. The only reason I deleted it was because podcasts were taking up too much memory space on my phone and I needed to cut back. I just got rid of all the ones I wasn‚Äôt listening to on a daily basis and this was one of them. Nothing bad to say about this on at all. It‚Äôs a real deep dive into Irish history and the host Finn Dwyer is great.I‚Äôm really looking forward to jumping back into it.

‚Ä¢ Invention 

This is one of the myriad of podcasts produced by the former How Stuff Works crew (owned by Discovery before being bought by iHeartRadio a few years back). This one is hosted by Robert Lamb and Joe McCormick, who also host the more popular Stuff to Blow Your Mind. Each episode of Invention covers the history of a different item or process of the modern world. 

The reason I unsubscribed is that Invention is basically almost exactly the same as their other show. They attempted to branch out and do something different but it wasn‚Äôt different at all. I decided to scrap it and stick with STBYM, which has been around for a decade and is much more interesting. Robert Lamb is insufferably boring and socially inept, but luckily Joe McCormick is the opposite and injects much needed humour and personality into each episode. I keep STBYM for the science and for Joe."

SkincareAddiction,fqfv08m,t3_g92hg4,1589332228.0,"Hi, 31F. I'm very fair and thanks to genetics, blue veins beneath my eyes are always visible. I also deal with some purple-ish discolouration in the corners of my eyes most of the time, in the exact same area where I have persistent milia. I wish I could go back in time and figure out what I did (or didn't do) that caused the milia because I didn't always have it and now I can't get rid of it.

In terms of eye creams, I fall slightly on the side of being in favour of them. I never tried a dedicated eye product until a couple of years ago. I'd heard good things, so I decided to try the Ole Henrikson Banana Bright Eye Cream. For me, it definitely helps. The vitamin C brightens my under eye area, which helps to mask the blue veins a bit, and the moisturization it provides is lovely. My only gripe, and it's not that big a deal, is that it takes a while to absorb. It's neither helped nor aggravated my milia, but compared to when I don't use an eye cream at all, it makes a noticeable difference for me overall. 

I accepted the veins years ago because they're genetic and I know they'll never disappear. The occasional discolouration I can stave off by being more diligent with my diet, exercise, and sleep, and as for the milia, I feel like that's a battle I'll be fighting for a while to come."

For the last couple of years, he's had a job that pays incredibly well but has unpredictable hours and is very high-stress. He's going through the motions at this point and is applying elsewhere. We just bought a house so financial stability is especially important right now.

What's great for you and your husband is that you're both highly educated and, from the sound of it, gainfully employed. As long as you both feel comfortable about whatever timeline you choose, I think you'll be just fine. You can continue to chip away at your student debt over the next several years and probably still be in great shape. If you guys are good with finances and have a firm grasp on your monthly and yearly budgeting, a baby will change the budget but not throw it completely off the rails.

To answer your ultimate question, I don't think there's ever an ideal time to have a baby. No one is ever as adequately prepared for it as they think they are, so we all just do the best we can.

The plan was always to get married before kids but, honestly, my biological clock is ticking loudly now and my perspective has kind of shifted. The past year or so I've been of the mind that you can get married anytime whereas fertility has a time limit (I'm 31). Ergo, I want to get a bun in this oven ASAP lol.

I work in advertising, a notoriously fickle industry even in boom times, and I‚Äôve learned all of the lessons you mentioned. It took me the better part of a decade to get to my dream job three years ago. I definitely paid my dues and I feel like our whole generation has. It‚Äôs definitely taking us longer than our parents to reach certain milestones though, simply due to economic stresses, like you said.

We were raised with pie-in-the-sky expectations of the world and what life could be. I don‚Äôt fault our parents and teachers for giving us that hope. I think they truly did believe - and still do believe - that we‚Äôre capable of achieving all the success they did. 

What they didn‚Äôt bargain for and couldn‚Äôt have predicted was the fact that our lives would be shaped more by events like 9/11, the 2008 financial crisis, etc than anything else. We all studied and worked incredibly hard to get through post-secondary. We‚Äôre the most highly educated generation in history but the least gainfully employed, which is incredibly frustrating and clearly not our fault. 

To be clear, I don‚Äôt blame the Baby Boomers either. The state of the world today is due just as much to forces outside of our control as it is to the ethos of our parents‚Äô generation. Blaming the Boomers is just as ridiculous as them blaming us for all of this. Like, if we‚Äôre going to play that game, every generation can blame the ones before them for contributing to certain aspects of their own misfortune, but it‚Äôs ultimately a waste of time. Can they go back in time and change any of it? No they can‚Äôt. Can *we*, the Millennials, do our best to make sure our own kids don‚Äôt face the same challenges we‚Äôre currently facing?

rant,fmxib2i,t3_fxi65b,1586465515.0,"Any Americans, like OP I presume, who are sick of their healthcare system, you‚Äôre the smart ones. You look at universal healthcare elsewhere in the western world and see it for what it really is. You understand that no system is perfect but that socialized medicine is one of the greatest achievements of the modern era. For certain unfathomable reasons, the USA has not yet embraced this fact.

If you‚Äôre interested in experiencing universal healthcare - because yes, you are entitled to it as a human being - we‚Äôd welcome you with open arms in Canada. Our healthcare system is one of our most precious and valued institutions and it baffles us that so many people in the States don‚Äôt feel the same. For those of you that do, we salute you and your progressiveness. Our doors are always open.

As OP conveyed, it comes down to morality. Frankly, anyone who thinks there should be a dollar value placed on human lives truly is an amoral individual. Especially in times like these, universal healthcare should be a no-brainer."

1) They‚Äôre rich and, since Trump‚Äôs a Republican president, he‚Äôll make sure taxes on the wealthy don‚Äôt go up

2) They‚Äôre lifelong Republicans who will vote red every federal election, no matter how bad the candidate.

3) Independent or party-less voters who were vehemently anti-Clinton, for one reason or another, so voted Trump in 2016. These are the same people who will vote Trump again this year because Joe Biden has a snowball‚Äòs chance in hell of beating him, but that‚Äôs a topic for another day."
