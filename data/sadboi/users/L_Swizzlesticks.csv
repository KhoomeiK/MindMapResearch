unpopularopinion,fr05irm,t3_gkqfyl,1589784378.0,"Some of us are deeply in tune with our emotions and desire the cleansing, cathartic release that comes with fully experiencing them, including sadness. Media that trigger those releases can be incredibly satisfying. We feel renewed and energized afterwards. It’s hard to explain to those who aren’t in touch with their emotions (not implying that you aren’t, OP). I also find that the more sensitive and empathetic one is, the more they connect to this sort of experience."

- Marley & Me
- Philadelphia
- Saving Mr. Banks
- The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas

The Fault In Our Stars was particularly brutal. I was crying from about half an hour to the end of the movie until about 10 minutes after the credits finished. It’s absolutely the saddest film I’ve ever watched. Be prepared if you decide to watch it."

 This is Jeremy & Audrey Roloff’s podcast (they’re the ones that left the TLC show Little People, Big World). At first I didn’t mind it. It was kind of fun and relatable because they’re my age and going through a lot of the same life phases. But then it shifted focus into being centred almost solely around religion. These two are self-centered, arrogant, and incredibly closed-minded. If you’re an evangelist Christian, you’ll probably love it. Otherwise, skip this one.

• Irish History Podcast

I actually really like this podcast and plan on subscribing again at some point. The only reason I deleted it was because podcasts were taking up too much memory space on my phone and I needed to cut back. I just got rid of all the ones I wasn’t listening to on a daily basis and this was one of them. Nothing bad to say about this on at all. It’s a real deep dive into Irish history and the host Finn Dwyer is great.I’m really looking forward to jumping back into it.

• Invention 

This is one of the myriad of podcasts produced by the former How Stuff Works crew (owned by Discovery before being bought by iHeartRadio a few years back). This one is hosted by Robert Lamb and Joe McCormick, who also host the more popular Stuff to Blow Your Mind. Each episode of Invention covers the history of a different item or process of the modern world. 

The reason I unsubscribed is that Invention is basically almost exactly the same as their other show. They attempted to branch out and do something different but it wasn’t different at all. I decided to scrap it and stick with STBYM, which has been around for a decade and is much more interesting. Robert Lamb is insufferably boring and socially inept, but luckily Joe McCormick is the opposite and injects much needed humour and personality into each episode. I keep STBYM for the science and for Joe."

As sad as it is to say this, always be weary of strangers who are *too* nice. When someone you’ve never met before greets you and then, apropos of nothing, proceeds to ask you what your future career plans or goals are, they’re trying to sell you something. You’re not an asshole for thinking “Why is this person being so nice to me? Why aren’t they like a normal stranger, awkwardly exchanging forced pleasantries with me?” No, you’re absolutely right to feel that way. Listen to your gut and don’t let them lure you in.

SkincareAddiction,fqfv08m,t3_g92hg4,1589332228.0,"Hi, 31F. I'm very fair and thanks to genetics, blue veins beneath my eyes are always visible. I also deal with some purple-ish discolouration in the corners of my eyes most of the time, in the exact same area where I have persistent milia. I wish I could go back in time and figure out what I did (or didn't do) that caused the milia because I didn't always have it and now I can't get rid of it.

In terms of eye creams, I fall slightly on the side of being in favour of them. I never tried a dedicated eye product until a couple of years ago. I'd heard good things, so I decided to try the Ole Henrikson Banana Bright Eye Cream. For me, it definitely helps. The vitamin C brightens my under eye area, which helps to mask the blue veins a bit, and the moisturization it provides is lovely. My only gripe, and it's not that big a deal, is that it takes a while to absorb. It's neither helped nor aggravated my milia, but compared to when I don't use an eye cream at all, it makes a noticeable difference for me overall. 

I accepted the veins years ago because they're genetic and I know they'll never disappear. The occasional discolouration I can stave off by being more diligent with my diet, exercise, and sleep, and as for the milia, I feel like that's a battle I'll be fighting for a while to come."

For the last couple of years, he's had a job that pays incredibly well but has unpredictable hours and is very high-stress. He's going through the motions at this point and is applying elsewhere. We just bought a house so financial stability is especially important right now.

What's great for you and your husband is that you're both highly educated and, from the sound of it, gainfully employed. As long as you both feel comfortable about whatever timeline you choose, I think you'll be just fine. You can continue to chip away at your student debt over the next several years and probably still be in great shape. If you guys are good with finances and have a firm grasp on your monthly and yearly budgeting, a baby will change the budget but not throw it completely off the rails.

To answer your ultimate question, I don't think there's ever an ideal time to have a baby. No one is ever as adequately prepared for it as they think they are, so we all just do the best we can.

The plan was always to get married before kids but, honestly, my biological clock is ticking loudly now and my perspective has kind of shifted. The past year or so I've been of the mind that you can get married anytime whereas fertility has a time limit (I'm 31). Ergo, I want to get a bun in this oven ASAP lol.

Your fiancé has given you a gift actually. By revealing his true colours now instead of after you’re married, he’s giving you an opportunity to escape.

We’re complicit in all of it by buying into the beauty industry, both literally and figuratively. It’s a multi-billion dollar a year global megalith that thrives on our collective insecurity.

I’ve felt angry, aimless, and misguided and part of that, I think, was from not being grounded in faith.

I hope you’re able to find peace, no matter how long it takes. My crisis of faith lasted for years, but I feel that it made my belief in and love for God even stronger in the end.

I work in advertising, a notoriously fickle industry even in boom times, and I’ve learned all of the lessons you mentioned. It took me the better part of a decade to get to my dream job three years ago. I definitely paid my dues and I feel like our whole generation has. It’s definitely taking us longer than our parents to reach certain milestones though, simply due to economic stresses, like you said.

We were raised with pie-in-the-sky expectations of the world and what life could be. I don’t fault our parents and teachers for giving us that hope. I think they truly did believe - and still do believe - that we’re capable of achieving all the success they did. 

What they didn’t bargain for and couldn’t have predicted was the fact that our lives would be shaped more by events like 9/11, the 2008 financial crisis, etc than anything else. We all studied and worked incredibly hard to get through post-secondary. We’re the most highly educated generation in history but the least gainfully employed, which is incredibly frustrating and clearly not our fault. 

To be clear, I don’t blame the Baby Boomers either. The state of the world today is due just as much to forces outside of our control as it is to the ethos of our parents’ generation. Blaming the Boomers is just as ridiculous as them blaming us for all of this. Like, if we’re going to play that game, every generation can blame the ones before them for contributing to certain aspects of their own misfortune, but it’s ultimately a waste of time. Can they go back in time and change any of it? No they can’t. Can *we*, the Millennials, do our best to make sure our own kids don’t face the same challenges we’re currently facing? Yes, to a degree I believe we can.

The two men each have a bit of Mulder and Scully in them. One more of a believer, the other a steadfast man of science. As time goes on, both are forced to question what’s actually real. Just like Mulder and Scully, they’re constantly being monitored by the feds, who reign them in when they get too close to discovering something pivotal.

SkincareAddiction,fmh7beg,t1_flmso5t,1586069147.0,That’s good advice. My skin is similar to OP’s and the Niacinamide & Zinc 10% makes my skin red and sensitive unfortunately. It’s also really sticky and I’m not sure if that’s just the particular batch mine came from or if that’s its actual consistency.

rant,fmgijjr,t3_fuu17h,1586049860.0,"Well, they can’t all be *that* stupid, so I figure there are a few reasons Trump’s more educated followers stick by him:

1) They’re rich and, since Trump’s a Republican president, he’ll make sure taxes on the wealthy don’t go up

2) They’re lifelong Republicans who will vote red every federal election, no matter how bad the candidate.

3) Independent or party-less voters who were vehemently anti-Clinton, for one reason or another, so voted Trump in 2016. These are the same people who will vote Trump again this year because Joe Biden has a snowball‘s chance in hell of beating him, but that’s a topic for another day."
AnxiousAttachment,fmghqiy,t3_fuwmhd,1586049326.0,"I am exactly the same. You’re not, in any way, alone, love. There’s lots of us anxiously attached folks out here, and we deserve true love and happiness just as much as everyone else and we’re capable of finding it. We might face more hurdles than some but we can do it. My partner is avoidant and we’ve been together four years next month. We just bought a house together and we’re making it work. You just need to find someone who loves you unconditionally and is willing to work on their own stuff too and everything else will fall into place. It’s possible to find your happiness ❤️"

Not only did we get 50K below the asking price, we also locked in a 2.5% interest rate due to the pandemic panic in the financial markets.

Not sure if that applied to high schools, but certainly to elementary and junior high schools in the CCSB. I went to high school at Bishop Carroll in the early 2000s and there were a ton of non-Catholic students there."

It often felt like he was playing for both sides and no side at the same time. I think Krycek was in it for himself. He didn’t care who he had to exploit or double cross as long as it got him ahead in the game.
