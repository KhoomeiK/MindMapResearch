JL first timer here.  

We just took the doors off for the first time recently and loved it, it‚Äôs like nothing else.  How does the driving experience of these style doors compare to driving with no doors? 

With no doors I had a general concern for our things flying out, but overall worth having that freedom. 

That being said, might be considering these as an alternative if it‚Äôs worth the investment."

Anxiety,fpka8lg,t3_gdwcei,1588690961.0,"Misophonia is a very real thing, I think all of us can relate to that trapped feeling when there is an unnerving, repetitive sound.

I can‚Äôt go to movie theaters for this exact reason.  I get hyper focused and uncontrollably frustrated and it‚Äôs all of the coughs, digging into popcorn, whispering..it‚Äôs too much.  

As far as moods go, dehydration can severely impact our emotions and tolerance.  If I notice I‚Äôm getting really agitated or confused, I drink a lot of water and take some magnesium, seems to lift me out of the rut."
Anxiety,fpa4s5l,t1_fpa0bcx,1588440804.0,"Wow, thanks for the detail, that does sound pretty intense.  I have been taking it for years at .5 twice a day.  Every doctor I‚Äôve had just continues to prescribe it and I never thought twice about it, just assumed it was what I needed.  It wasn‚Äôt until recently a doctor finally explained to me the danger and is taking me off. 

I have stopped taking the night pill, so .5 in the morning and have been pretty well.  I started taking CBD and exercising and can tend to fall asleep naturally.

From what you‚Äôre describing, maybe because I‚Äôm still getting it once a day, I‚Äôm just not feeling any withdrawals yet..."

greenville,fozwjk7,t3_gagxop,1588198129.0,"Not an ideal circumstance these days to make new friends unfortunately.  The good news, Greenville has no shortage of outdoor enthusiasts and because of the growth in the area recently, there is pretty much a niche for all types here.

Once things open, there are a few mixed use areas where folks congregate.  Maybe try Gather downtown, it‚Äôs a permanent collective of local vendors and restaurants. 

There is Taylors Mill, in Taylors, has a nice coffee shop, 13 Stripes brewery, and an old school style arcade among other things.

A cool gathering spot near the swamp rabbit trail is called Swamp Rabbit Cafe and has good fresh meat/produce and a nice outdoor bar/pizza place. 

Lastly, Local Q has awesome BBQ, and tons of board games and pool tables, good spot for game day. 

Unfortunately late night life isn‚Äôt in my cards anymore, so can‚Äôt help y‚Äôall there.

Good luck and welcome!"
