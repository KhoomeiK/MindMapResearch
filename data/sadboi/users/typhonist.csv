The goal isn't just to qualify people that will buy, it's to disqualify people that aren't going to so you aren't wasting your time and budget. If I'm selling a Mercedes Benz, do I care what poor people think of my marketing or advertising? No. They are irrelevant because they aren't buying. 

You can see the same methodology at work with literally every other thing that is meant to appeal to people. Are liberals trying to appeal to conservatives? Conservatives to liberals? Are churches appealing to atheists? Are make up companies appealing to men? Motorcycle companies to women? 

No. Good marketing is about disqualifying just as much as qualifying.

And as it relates to scammers, those aren't the scammers. Those are just employees trying to make a buck. The actual scammers pay people like me to write scripts and develop strategies that they can pay those people to read. 

Saying those people are the scammers is like saying that street level drug dealers are the movers and shakers of the drug game. They're not. You don't see the architects until they get dragged out of the shadows.

Speaking as someone that used to live and function in that environment, respect is a matter of basic survival. If people think you're a bitch, they will come for what little bit you've scraped together for yourself. Because what the fuck are you going to do about it, bitch?

Combine that with the trauma of poverty, mental illness, drugs like crack and meth destroying impulse control, and the many guns, well.. you have a recipe for a lot of death.

Life is cheap because your own life doesn't mean shit to anyone. You know your future is probably going to be death or prison.

Has nothing to do with landlords, opportunities, dignity or whatever. It's just very basic survival in an ugly environment that's hard to get out of without substantial help.

EDIT: Several people have commented that we are saying the same thing. I really don't think so. Even if you have a shitload of money and opportunity, you still can't let disrespect stand when you're hanging around with the type of people that will push you.

I lived undiagnosed with Bipolar Disorder and severe depression for about 15 years, with plenty of the mental, emotional, and physical scars to show for it. My upbringing was actually pretty good, all things considered. I had a family that loved me, always tried to do right by me, always had a roof over my head, food in my belly, and a couple toys.

What I didn't have was anyone in my immediate family or life that had severe mental illness; and so I felt very alone while I was surrounded by people and going through that.

But no, what I'm talking about is the perception that depression forced onto me, that if kindness didn't fit some kind of picture of perfection, that it must be flawed in some way. And my mental illness, and brain, used that as a way to self-isolate further, nurture my paranoia and antisocial perceptions, and justify my shitty actions toward other people. 

On the other hand, have definitely met some narcissistic assholes in the course of things. People that wanted to be perceived as kind without doing any of the actual work, throwing other people under the bus to preserve the image they were crafting or crafted of themselves. And management that took advantage of the naive to accept low pay while they were pocketing plenty for their salaries.

I used to think of it in a binary state, mostly to self-reinforce my depressed, Bipolar mind that I was right in thinking that everyone were just selfish pricks. The truth of the matter I was being unfair to myself and to other people. I was unfair to myself because there were plenty of times I put other peoples' needs ahead of my own. And it was unfair to other people, because it discredited the small kindnesses that they chose to put in the world.

Most of the people I met in the course of my work were good, but flawed people. Some people were most definitely not though.

And if they're pretty women they're often getting donations and gifts from lonely dudes."

And as someone that's worked in those types of companies, those ""blacklists"" tend to work like shit in addition to being gruntwork sloughed off onto interns and entry level people. 

What probably happened is that the person doing the entry didn't know how to do it right, did a half-assed job, or the blacklist ""lost"" the entry due to the gremlins in the systems. 

I'd be interested to see what proof they have that someone made the choice to not include them. Although that also wouldn't surprise me, considering some of the people I've worked for in the past."

BlackPeopleTwitter,ff9bqkd,t1_ff98xwv,1579709335.0,"I don't have an answer to the first part, but I can answer the second part. I live in Northeast Ohio, home of the illustrious Cleveland Browns, an area known for its abusive relationships with their sports teams. When Art Modell decided to move the Browns to Baltimore to become the Ravens, there was a few years of ""fuck Art Modell and fuck the Ravens."" Now it's just slow simmered down into a rivalry with Baltimore, though not as rabid as the rivalry with the Steelers. 

In the period before we got the Cleveland Browns 2.0, it was, ""Well, now who do we root for?"" And then after Browns 2.0 rolled in, it pretty much went back to JESUS CHRIST WHY IS OUR TEAM SUCH SHIT, also fuck Art Modell and the Ravens, but not as hard as the Steelers."

MMORPG,fbe4xxt,t1_fbe3xcx,1576778282.0,"Skill injectors and Rorquals heavily changed Eve about that time. I don't know if you're an Eve player or not, but the way training works in that game is you pick a skill, and after X amount of time you learn the skill. So like, if you wanted to learn Gallente Battleships (GB) 1 through 5. GB 1 would take like six hours hours, GB 2 would take like a day, GB 3 would take a few days, GB 4 would take like 7 days, and GB 5 would take about 30 days.

Well, skill injectors made it so you can just buy skill points instead of things being time gated. So if you wanted to fly a titan or a rorqual, you could buy a bunch of PLEX (which you use to buy subscription time), sell the PLEX in game for ISK (the in-game currency), and then use the ISK to buy skill injectors. So you could take a brand new character and inject it into the most powerful ships, such as a rorqual, which is an incredibly effective mining ship. 

It changed A LOT of the metagame in Eve. The running joke in null-sec space is everyone has at least two or three accounts, because you gotta have your main character, a pvp character (if it's not your main), and a rorqual/titan pilot to make the monies."
influencermarketing,fbal0zq,t3_eccqns,1576680879.0,"I wouldn't do surveys or interviews. They really aren't a good metric because a lot of people don't necessarily know what they'd actually buy until it's in front of them. You could have a great price point but oh there aren't the right features. You could build all the right features, but oh the price point is off. You can get both of those dialed in but oh, people resist change and don't necessarily want to learn a new tool when what they've been doing already works for them. 

Plus, the fashion blogger/influencer industry isn't necessarily a good market. As someone that's worked in it as a marketer, there's a lot of phonies and inconsistency, people who are trying to fake it til they make it while they go broke. It's definitely not a demographic that I'd be looking to build any kind of long-term business off of. 

But, if you want to go through with it, I would suggest building a Minimum Viable Product and selling that instead of screwing around with surveys and polls. Those can be useful at times, but I've yet to see them be a good tool for actually building a business."

WhitePeopleTwitter,fa9wt2b,t1_fa9m5kg,1575895038.0,"I don't think it is though. 

My experience is anecdotal, but I live in Ohio, which is a Purple/Red swing state, in a very Rust Belt-y area. Blue collar, several closed businesses and factories, and creeping urban decay. 

I know seven people, four of which I'm related to, that specifically voted against Hillary. One saw it as a way to give the Clintons the middle finger because of NAFTA, two are Vietnam and Korea era vets who viewed Benghazi as the government abandoning their people again, two are questionably sane people who got swept up in Alex Jones and the whole deep state thing, and two viewed it as voting for the Status Quo/Clinton (which isn't good for a lot of people here) versus Something Different/Trump because it's not like their lives are going to get any better by voting Status Quo. 

That's just people I was close enough to actually talk to about it. 

She didn't destroy Trump in the popular vote. 66 million to 63 million. 

On paper, logically, Clinton is a skilled politician who probably would've been an okay president. She's intelligent, skilled, with a lot of experience. Unfortunately, a lot of people don't make their decisions with logic and rationality. They make them from emotion. And emotionally, she was a terrible candidate because that emotion energized at least seven people who either didn't care or felt ""fuck the government"" about it all to go out and vote against her. 

So no, I don't think it is beyond ridiculous. Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Ohio are all pretty similar states, all Purple-Red, all went to Trump. I can't imagine I'm the only one who knows people like these in this states, in the types of areas I live in."
