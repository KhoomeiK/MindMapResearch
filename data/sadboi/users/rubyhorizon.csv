Afterwards I crash out hard. Physical crash sets in within 30 minutes for me usually, while the mental side takes a few hours to start. That’s where I need a lot of care from my Doms and my own effort to not get lost in my past. For some subs it doesn’t happen at all, others might experience subdrop mildly, and others deal with a big drop.

With time, trying different things out and a lot of communication, my Doms and I have worked out a lot of what I need to deal with subdrop, and while it still hits hard I don’t get as lost in the past now. I have better experiences from more recent times to think on instead."

socialskills,fptftx4,t3_gffso3,1588890474.0,"Practice! Choose a story you know is interesting and practice different ways of telling it. I find it helps to start with part of the most exciting part, or in some way relate it back to the conversation. 

Keep it on track. The fewer tangents, the easier it is for others to understand and stay tuned into it. 

Describe your thoughts and feelings here and there. There’s more to a story than the actions. 

Have a neat ending for it, and then let the next person who has just been reminded of their own awesome story share. 

They also don’t have to be long. One of my favourites is simply “you know that meme where there’s a little girl making a kiss face and it says “I want to punch you. Softly. With my mouth”? That’s exactly how my youngest used to kiss people! She was such a cute toddler.” Three sentences, it’s a cute story, and it gets people started in talking about their own kids when they were toddlers. 

For a longer story, I might start with “I watched STAR force siege a neighbours house once”. The overall story isn’t that exciting - we were nosily peeking over the back fence and there wasn’t much action from our view, but I can add in a reflection on how maybe we shouldn’t have been trying to watch the local version of SWAT from such a close perspective."

relationship_advice,fpb1o63,t3_gcf8qt,1588460237.0,"Take your time. Spend a while making out, kissing her neck and shoulders, exploring her skin to find the places that make her tingle with pleasure. See if she likes her ears being nibbled or the feel of your face buried into the base of her neck while you kiss her. Run your hands along her, tracing your finger tips up and down her arms and sides and legs, before making your way to her chest. 

Play with her there for a bit, see if she starts squirming when you roll her nipples between your fingers gently, or kiss and lick her. 

Slowly make your way down to her clit. Hopefully you’ve found a few places that send a wave of pleasure through her and she’s already wet. Take your time stroking her thighs, every so often letting your hands brush her clit as you go from one side to the other. 

Then start giving her clit attention. Gently stroke it, up and down or side to side or in circles. See what pressure and stroke makes her breathing change. 

Explore inside her with one finger, then two or three if she’s comfortable with that. Stay gentle with it, worship her body with your hands and mouth. Slowly push your fingers in and out while your mouth or other hand keeps running lazy circles and strokes across her clit. 

When she wants you to go harder, do. That means more pressure usually, not getting rougher. Use the pads of your fingers to press against her g spot if you can find it as you’re trusting into her. 

It might take some time to find what works for her, but take your time exploring her body and learning how her breathing changes and her body moves in response to what you do."

In general, it takes more than a diagnosis alone for child services to be concerned. There need to be severe behaviours that threaten the safety and life of the child.

So first thing to cover is does she have the medical support she needs to deal with the pain, along with any necessary changes at home (if it’s a chronic condition) to make it more accessible? 

Next, I would seriously recommend looking at sexual intimacy as more than PIV intercourse. I have had some of the most amazing sexual experiences of my life without anyone else going in my pants recently, which is making me want so much more. Spend some time, when she’s up for it, focusing entirely on her and finding ways to give her pleasure. Take time to learn every place on her body that makes her long for more of your touch.

If you’re old enough to be working, I’m guessing you’re old enough or nearly old enough to move out. You can start making plans to do that, to never have to go back there. Whether that’s by getting an apartment on your own or into a share house, there are things you can work towards so you have a space that is yours, not his.

I go over what the other person said and try to understand their point of view. And then we sit down together, more calmly, and I apologise for losing my sh!t and listen. 

If the other person won’t give me the space to speak after I’ve listened, I file that away for the future - I don’t argue with people who won’t listen to me and just shut them out unless I know they’re working on doing better too.

One thing I use a lot is a playlist I’ve made specifically for this."
BreakUps,foq7z7a,t1_foovkov,1587986184.0,"When I broke up with my ex, it was me communicating “I have tried for years to sort out these two specific issues with you and you have refused to step up, and I will not continue to be your live in maid, sugar mama and sex doll while you destroy me.”

Of course it’s rare for both parties to be in agreement. In my case, my ex liked having me around to control and abuse so it was hard on him when I decided to not be his victim anymore. If I could have kept him without the abuse I would have."
BDSMAdvice,foq7f6g,t3_g8v1us,1587985660.0,"Relate! I have a password protected notebook on my phone where I have the rules we’ve agreed on, our hard and soft limits, some other relevant things. Page 1 of this notebook is where they’ve written things they want me to remember when I’m in sub space or sub drop and they’re not available to help. There’s another page where I’ve put in heaps of reminders for myself and things I can try to help myself out. I also have a playlist that I put on for myself in those times."
BDSMAdvice,foq78ct,t3_g8r7di,1587985476.0,"I don’t do things that I don’t have permission for within my agreement. Partly because this is what I want (and if I wanted something to change I would talk to them) and partly because I’ve learned very quickly that if I wait until I have permission to do things it feels so much better.

If this is a big thing for you, talk it out with your Dom."
BDSMAdvice,foq70k8,t3_g8xg9g,1587985260.0,"Normal for me too. If there are plans for doing things that will be physically exhausting for me beyond the usual, our play space is set up with everything I will need afterwards too, like something to eat, something to drink and the blankets I need, all in close proximity. That way afterwards I can rest up for a bit and regain my legs before trying to move."
AmItheAsshole,foq6mnl,t3_g8ucaz,1587984878.0,NTA. My ex has the same issue when he has visitation and takes our children out somewhere. It’s a nasty double standard.
BDSMAdvice,foq4efh,t3_g8re70,1587982596.0,"I struggle with this too. You’re not alone in this. I agree with the suggestions to talk to a therapist - witnessing such abuse can be incredibly harmful. But also, talk to your Dom. One of the things mine is doing with me is helping me get through my triggers, one at a time. Some in the sense of a scene, some just in our relationship outside of that dynamic."
SubSanctuary,fops8vp,t3_g8s6lt,1587970457.0,"I find it helps to know what the person I’m taking photos for wants to see. If they’re a boobs person, I focus on that. If they have specific images in mind, I try to make that happen. 

And I’d start with photos until you understand how you feel most comfortable on camera."
BDSMAdvice,folm7ar,t3_g7sd4d,1587865282.0,"Start with what you find most comfortable. More please is what I started with. Sometimes my Dom will let me get away with that, other times I have to specifically say what I want more of."
BPD,fokpspz,t3_g7vbd6,1587846634.0,"Yep, so many people have told me that they feel they have to tread carefully. It doesn’t seem to matter what I do, I try so hard to be honest and understanding and they keep doing it."
AmItheAsshole,foedg2e,t3_g6uear,1587701145.0,"NTA. Listen, I’m borderline and have a love/hate thing with my birthday. But it’s up to me to take responsibility for myself. When I have blown up like that, I do apologise for that and put into calm words what hurt me in the moment. 

Don’t marry him if he can’t handle taking responsibility for himself. Been there, done that, we’re getting divorced."
askwomenadvice,foed2ew,t3_g6vk1j,1587700907.0,"I have felt done in my marriage and pushed through, but there came a point where I couldn’t anymore.

SubSanctuary,foector,t3_g70n31,1587700760.0,"I’ve seen a lot of posts about using internet, phones and messaging. I game with mine, headsets on and one of the things he enjoys is trying to distract me from the game while we play."
BPD,fo96n9i,t3_g61u5j,1587611772.0,"Yes and no! I’ve got two FPs now and they are both already stable, accepting and communicative which makes it much easier to tell them when I’m in a spiral and need help. 

But this is my first ever experience like this. My other FPs have been way less capable of handling any kind of friendship or more with me which made it harder to care about my own health and stability."
FamilyIssues,fo960b8,t3_g6189j,1587611343.0,"This is abuse, and it’s not your fault. As a teenager I had to start my first ever leaving safely plan to get away from similar things, and it was awful but gave me hope for my future. You’ve got a whole life out there, a whole world to explore as much or as little as you want, and there are people and organisations that can and will help you along the way. 

So even if you can’t safely leave right now, you can research and make a plan to do that one day."
SubSanctuary,fo6jrb3,t3_g5yxjy,1587560538.0,"Mine have said that they enjoy the sense of being able to make me have pleasure and enjoyment. They know my body fairly well and are learning it better every day and they can just about get any reaction out of me they want. Because they’re focused on my pleasure they tend to put off their own climaxes, which means it’s more intense for them."
SubSanctuary,fo5kk7r,t3_g5ktrk,1587527930.0,"Some ideas beyond yes/no:
That feels so good
I’m going to/ I want to cum
Describing exactly how and why it feels good - I like feeling your fingers on my skin/in me
Please do that again"
ParentingInBulk,fo5gq36,t3_fxo9r6,1587525234.0,"Household of 3 adults and 5 kids. Managing with the restrictions has been difficult! But the one adult who deals with the shopping has been getting certain things we go through quickly every time she’s out or is taking someone else out (we’ve got a couple friends who can’t drive so she ends up going to the shops 2-4 times a week). It really sucks that the options are going to a half dozen shops to get everything we need in one trip, or spread them out across the week."
BDSMAdvice,fo5gdhe,t3_g5min6,1587524995.0,"The whole point of a safeword is to communicate when you can’t handle it. Any Dom who keeps going is not worth another second of your time. Your Dom doesn’t get to override you using your safeword, ever. That’s assault and rape."
AmItheAsshole,fo5djel,t3_g5hta8,1587523077.0,"NTA and your parents are trash. Ok maybe they’re not always like this, but you shouldn’t be getting punished for being a teenager and making out, and that’s an overwhelmingly awful punishment for anything."
internetparents,fn90v6a,t3_g047sj,1586755803.0,"I have physical disabilities and a lifetime of trauma to go with it too. It’s hard to manage that stuff, I get it. 

There’s a lot of wisdom in some of these replies. I’d encourage you to have a good look at your life and work out what you can control without needing anyone else. Build up some confidence in what you can do. And then carry that confidence into other parts of your life. Maybe there are some anxiety or abuse survivors groups - face to face or online - that you can find support. Maybe your resume and cover letter are letting you down in your job search. 

But for now I think you really need to start looking at what you can do. Cos there will be things. You don’t get to this point in your life with disabilities and trauma and not work a few things out along the way!"

It sounds frustrating, but her keeping money that’s owed to her because your dad should have been supporting her financially to raise you isn’t wrong."
