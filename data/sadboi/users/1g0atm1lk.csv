sleep,fk87ogw,t3_fguioc,1583950911.0,"Its kinda weird how much I can relate to this. On a normal day I'm sleeping at 3am ish and I gotta get up at 6 for school. I've been trying to sleep more for awhile as it's seriously impacting my ability to function in day to day stuff (falling asleep in class, etc). For me its not screen time as I don't have any devices i can use at home. It's literally I can't sleep. So everyone saying its because of screentime isn't necessarily true. I have no reason to stay up and know I will be exhausted all day but cannot sleep no matter what efforts i put in (like music, total darkness, all of that) maybe you have a similar problem to me mate but I'd hope not as its fucking hell. as the other people said if its because of screentime then just tale the devices away before bed cuz its not a good boat in be in. best of luck to ya"
AskWomen,fhoczmg,t3_f41s0d,1581750582.0,"A freaking lot. My ma actually got in trouble for it the other day at work. She was talking to this guy, like smalltalk nothing big. She has a habit of laughing a lot in conversations with people she doesnt really know, cuz shes got anxiety and all that fun stuff. Well he interpreted it as her flirting and told her boyfriend ""oH sHe wAs fLirTinG wiTh mE..."" and blah blah. She didn't have any intention whatsoever of flirting with this man. She just spoke to him for a few minutes and went on with their day. So to sum it up, it happens a lot."
RandomActsOfGaming,fh2bdok,t3_f14s0v,1581244488.0,"why did the chicken cross the road?

he just wanted some snacks man, but when he got there they were all out of his favorite. This was the breaking point for mister chicken. He couldn't take it anylonger. Somehad had stolen his CnC metal figures, when he hung out with people they'd only play on his Chintendo Clitch. His high score on his favorite game had been beaten. His girlfriend had been eating seeds with another chicken. His parents took his feeder. His cluck marks were going down in the barnyard. And the goddamned store couldn't have any Chickers bars?!?! Mister chicken had enough! He was so chill but he was tired of all of this mistreatment! So he did a rather reasonable thing and decided he wanted to show people how sick he was of their shit. So he got half of his feathers plucked off, dyed the remaining a obnoxious neon green and pierced one of his...claw things? When he got home, his parents just laughed at him for looking like a deranged featherduster. So he just went to his room, got on his Chintendo Chitch and played on it all night, still kinda hungry man."

I mean i know it hurts right now but I'll get over him. I don't think he wants to get back and neither really do I  I just wanted him to know how I felt and I did. But with his own words, it's not my problem anymore."

amiugly,fbuhfi4,t3_eel5yx,1577114460.0,"i think you look pretty decent. if you had to improve on anything i'd say maybe trim up your eyebrows a little, but otherwise you're fine. your hair, including the color, really flatters you. i mean, the reason you might be getting ghosted is less of ur unattractive and more its just fucking tinder. go out and meet a nice lady, or guy, whatever your preference. i think you'd have better luck."
