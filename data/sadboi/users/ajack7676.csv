But, it seems like you might consider life worth living if you had those qualities that you currently lack? Funny, social, interesting? Decent job, credit score? These are all things that are definitely attainable if you want them! For me, finding a community to be a part of was a huge help. Learn an instrument, join a band, join a service group, volunteer. For me, taking a big picture look and seeing how much I have to yet to give has helped me to stay. If you think no one loves you, I just want you to know that I love you. I believe in you. Stay strong OP! You got this!"
