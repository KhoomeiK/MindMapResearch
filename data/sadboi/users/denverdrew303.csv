Denver,f1w283j,t3_dagd0o,1569779244.0,I understand why people do it. This is happening to my relatives in Los Altos. They are the most caring people you can know and they are frustrated. There is always an alternative. Make a lot more affordable housing is one. I will gladly pay my taxes to help.  Maybe have locations people can park? Allowing people to park in front of people’s homes is not a good solution.

She was a model for hire. She told me she was a student and a single mother. I am not sure if it was true. We had a good time though. I thought for sure she was out for free meals or a match.com employee.

nfl,eoeuof2,t3_brgv7p,1558508950.0,I watched most of Elway’s 162 wins( 5th all time). He was the most exciting quarterbacks to ever watch play. He didn’t have much of a running game until Terrell Davis came along. His defenses were average at best. He just had a will to win like no other.
