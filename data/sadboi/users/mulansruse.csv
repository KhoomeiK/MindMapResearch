Put yourself in this woman’s shoes. You get a puppy and put in the time/love/effort/money it takes to raise a happy, well-behaved dog for 5 years. Then your home burns down and you lose everything - maybe you even think you’re poor dog died in the fire! - then you find out that your beloved pet didn’t die but is out there, scared, possibly injured, and you look FOR YEARS! You scour every outlet that you can only to find out that someone else found your dog and has decided that they deserve him more than you do...
I can’t even imagine what a nightmare that poor woman must be going through! 
I can empathize with what you’re feeling. I have severe panic attacks and depression myself and I know how much my dog has saved my life many times over, but I would never put someone else through that heartache just to make myself feel better. That is cruel. You’ve only had this dog for a few months and now you know how much the love of a pet can bring into your life. Adopt a shelter dog that would otherwise lose their life, then you can save each other. This is not your dog. No matter how many times you say it. This dog is someone else’s sanity and you have stolen it."

When I graduated my dad told me that he had money for me to be able to go to college. I opted to get married and have a kid instead. At no point did I assume that that money was “mine”. Later on I did decide to go to school and I never asked for anything from him because at that point I felt like I was an adult who took care of my own finances. I worked an extra job and worked out grants and scholarships on my own. That money was never mine. He offered me the opportunity to go to school without incurring a huge debt - he did not offer me cash to do whatever I wanted with. I’m pretty sure he enjoyed many vacations and house renovations with that money. And why shouldn’t he?? He earned it."

He put that money away specifically for his dog. As someone that works in the veterinary field, I wish more pet owners were this forward-thinking and responsible when it comes to pet emergencies.

It’s no one else’s household but your own. A light snack on a plate that only your kid uses doesn’t need a full wash every time he uses it. It’s washed thoroughly every night, so what’s the big deal? Your sister is living with you out of the kindness of your heart and doesn’t have the right to tell you how to wash dishes and she definitely doesn’t have the right to give your kid a complex about it. If she doesn’t like it, she can leave. Going to the family about it is a dick move. You aren’t children anymore where tattling on a sibling gets you the outcome you want. It’s also kinda shitty that your moms wouldn’t back you up on the rules of your own house. She doesn’t even have a problem with it, she just doesn’t want you to upset your sister! That’s bs imo."

My husband is also schizophrenic and is actually currently in the psych ward (lol, my life is kind of a shit show) 
It’s hard as hell because it can sometimes feel like you are going crazy right along with them! I feel you sister, and I’m sorry that you all have to live in that constant state of chaos. One of the first things I learned is that you will never talk a schizophrenic person out of a delusion. It is reality to them just like the sky being blue is reality to you. Logic doesn’t work. Arguing doesn’t work. All you can do is listen and sympathize (i.e. I can understand how (blank, blank) would make you angry, sad, paranoid, etc. if that happened to me I would feel that way too). A good book to read is “I’m not sick, I don’t need help” by Dr Xavier Amador. It helps puts things in perspective for those of us on the outside looking in. Once you have that perspective, it may help with some (definitely not all) of the anxiety. But it will also help you learn how to help them without it becoming a world war in your house. 
Get out of the house as much as you can. Involve yourself in group therapy. NAMI has meetings everywhere and some of those meetings are for family members of those with mental illness. If nothing else it will be a place to vent so that you’re not always the Debbie downer of your friend group. Another thing, don’t be afraid to create your safe space at home, like locking your door and making your room as comfortable and calming as possible so that you feel as settled as you can be when you are home. If you find those NAMI meetings, take your dad with you. I’m sure he needs something like that too. 
Put yourself and your safety first. It is not your place to be anyone’s punching bag no matter what their ailments. Set boundaries and enforce them (this one is hard but necessary). 
Get noise cancelling headphones so that you can zone out when things get crazy. That has helped my sanity more times than I can count. Stay strong, sister."

The biggest help that I found is a company called gene sight. It almost like an allergy test in that they test your DNA to see what medications are more likely to actually help and what medications just don’t help. I would start there. They also charge on a sliding scale, so if insurance doesn’t cover it and he fits their criteria, it could be free or very cheap to take it. I believe that you have to go through a doctor to get the test done, but on their website they direct you to doctors near you that work with them. 
My thoughts are with you. I know how hard it is to watch someone you love suffer and not be able to help. My mother ended up taking her life and my brother is in prison for beating someone up while he was in psychosis (he had been untreated and living on the streets for quite some time). My husband is currently in-patient right now for trying to kill him self. The struggle is real and the help is, sadly, lacking. All you can do is keep looking. Even if it means calling every psychiatrist in the phone book (I’ve done that) and getting his name on every waiting list no matter how long.
