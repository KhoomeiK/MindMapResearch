As someone who has been with him for over a year now- and am inches away from freedom from emetophobia due to working with him, I have another question. I detailed my journey in the form of weekly journal entries to coincide with the treatment he was teaching me each week- basically everything that will be detailed in the book. As sufferers would you be more willing to read this self help book if you knew my story (or any sufferer‚Äôs journey) to freedom was included in the book? Or would you read it regardless if it didn‚Äôt have first hand patient experience? Just trying to gauge if my story along side will be helpful to readers!!"

Anxiety,f6xrhqs,t1_f6xq867,1573256483.0,"I‚Äôm currently overcoming emetophobia (fear of vomiting) by intensive ERP therapy. I went from eating 500 calories a day panic stricken unable to leave my bed to being able to function in day to day life. I just now started Paxil in hopes of helping my panic attacks and even just taking it showed me how far I‚Äôve come because the medication is known to cause nausea and vomiting. While the first few days I did feel nauseous and it was horrible I pressed on and kept going and am seeing real results within my anxiety levels. Recovery is possible. Check out the emetophobia forum it‚Äôs so super helpful.

For everyone with this disorder seek CBT and ERP therapy!! It‚Äôs the only thing that works with phobias!"

I am a female :) but I have learned through my emetophobia group that my therapist puts together both male and females all ages and types experience this. So I guess that‚Äôs a little comforting knowing this disorder does not discriminate. And you absolutely should draw what your monster looks like. That was actually one of my very first exposure therapy homework. He also wanted me to draw some of the things my monster says to me around the drawing, like don‚Äôt eat too much you‚Äôll puke, or don‚Äôt leave the house or else you‚Äôll barf! Stuff like that. Helped externalize it so much and made fighting against it much easier. Like you are fighting a monster and not yourself. In its self I believe that‚Äôs true- because our true selves would never say those awful horrible things right? You so got this. Baby steps will get you far!

It‚Äôs a new phenomena since I‚Äôm now in a place in my recovery where I‚Äôm hanging out with friends a lot more and I‚Äôm still anxious being around them and in new places. It‚Äôs like I can‚Äôt catch my breath or I‚Äôm swallowing a lot of air while talking? I don‚Äôt know the remedy yet except to try and be more relaxed?
emetophobia,f27emm1,t1_f23prb0,1570036506.0,"You are so welcome, and you are too kind!! We are for sure very much a like. Sometimes I even break down and mourn for my old self. With so much time and energy wasted on trying to make myself not throw up- I don‚Äôt even want to calculate the hours I‚Äôve spent. Sometimes I think that with all that wasted time I spent I could have built such an amazing career... or just something worthwhile. And like you, instead it stole away so many moment with friends, family, and loved ones. To not be engaged in conversation instead in my head mulling over what I ate, when I ate, how I feel, if I feel like it‚Äôs ‚Äògoing to happen‚Äô. Ugh. All of that was such huge motivation though, thinking about all the time I still have left on earth, and do I want to be 80 years old and the only thing I did in life was stop myself from throwing up. And in reality- none of it is even real! Throwing up or not isn‚Äôt up to some magical fairy that I thought I had control over. Which I think a lot of anxiety disorders are based in really- the fear of losing control. And I think in a way emetophobia gave me that control I yearned for. I also like you wish I could just drink ipicac or stick my finger down my throat- I‚Äôve thought of it many times, but you know what I find really interesting is that when I first started seeing my new psychiatrist a few months ago I was explaining my emetophobia to her and what I feared most about throwing up was that it could happen anytime anywhere and I never knew when that moment was going to be, and since it had been soo long (I think the last time I threw up I was 12) it felt like I always had to be on watch, on guard. And I admitted that there was part of me that felt like my emetophobia, my fear could control it. I mean I had gone two decades being afraid! For sure it was the fear that kept me safe. She then asked about all the vomit exposure I was doing with my therapist and I told her that they were helping, and then she sprung a bomb on me and told me she wanted to see me throwing up, and not just once, many many many times!! I literally was like wait what?! Like with ipicac or something? And she was like yes something like that. And I‚Äôm not sure if it was some crazy reverse psychology stuff- but something clicked in my brain that I will actually vomit someday. Because up until that point I guess I had deep down believed that because I was so afraid that it just wasn‚Äôt going to happen to me. And she ripped that away in an instant. She then of course went on to say that if I ever were to do an actual vomiting exposure I had to be in such a different place and completely and totally willing. But I think she said it just for the reason it worked- it made me have to realistically accept that I will vomit someday. Emetophobia won‚Äôt stop it. So I was like, well if it‚Äôs going to happen I better get on board and not fear this anymore. So I truly hope that moment happens for you- when you are ready to accept that it will happen. And when we do finally vomit I truly believe it won‚Äôt be that bad at all. Compared to what we‚Äôve lived through tormenting ourselves day after day. And regards to your new therapist as long as she is well versed in exposure therapy then the same guidelines apply regardless of the phobia. Starting very small and working your way up to your biggest fear. You can write out your biggest fear- being fake vomiting in the toilet in public? And that way she will know what to work up towards. My therapist is an ocd/anxiety specialist so yes he has a very structured way of doing it. But like I said as long as they specialize in exposure therapy then you will be in good hands. I do recommend doing the exposures with a professional because they teach you how to RESPOND to the feared exposure which is the most important element. But like me, I‚Äôm sure you will do the exposure with them during the session then during the week practice on your own at home or in public. It‚Äôs like school, you‚Äôll learn then have homework haha. Let me know if that helps! Keep me posted!!"
emetophobia,f232a91,t1_f1stafn,1569903593.0,"Omg, this comment means SO much to me you have no idea. I am so happy to hear you are starting CBT. It will be the best thing you will ever do- learning to free yourself from emetophobia. I have to admit I don't often feel brave at all, but I just keep pushing, and I think about all the other people who were just like me and made it to the other side of recovery. I feel like I am almost there! And I was you- just mere months ago. I would have rather died than vomited a year ago. And honestly this disorder took me to the brink of death with how sick I was from not eating.  Now I can see life is so much more, so much more than emetophobia and anxiety. I too for months would cry to my therapist and say that I didn't want to fully let go of my fear because I was afraid the moment I accepted vomiting, it would happen. As if there was some cosmic magic wand standing over me that decided it was time. Well I am here to say, I have accepting vomiting, and I still haven't actually vomited! It is an anxiety trap to keep us sick and afraid. If we fear it then the disorder lives. That was a huge shift- realizing that in order to stop being tormented with vomit thoughts taking up SO much brain power and time and energy, I had to let go. Let go and take a leap of faith into the unknown and say to myself, well maybe the moment I decide I am okay with vomiting, maybe it will happen. Maybe it won't. But I have to let go. The only way to free myself was to become unafraid. And honestly the first step was when I was SO fed up with it all and all the rituals and safety behaviors and I was having period cramps and feeling nauseous and instead of panicking and crying like normal, I said F it. I am going to fake puke into my sink and ASK myself to throw up. I said anxiety, emetophobia, MAKE me puke! I got to the point where I was sick of living 20 years with this. I too had a traumatic vomiting experience, mine at 10 years old, I am now 32. Very similar to you. And guess what- no I did not puke, and it felt EMPOWERING. To take the power away from emetophobia. And I can bet when you begin to do exposures with that attitude- where you are so fed up with living like this and realize that these exposures will NOT make you throw up- it's actually very hard for a healthy stomach to vomit, you will see, this fear, it is such a lie. We CAN handle it when it will actually happen and these exposures are showing us that we can. And I am sure if you are seeing a good therapist you will work your way up on a fear ladder, starting very small with just looking at cartoon people throwing up. I did that for a long time, then slooowly moving myself up. It took a year to get to a place of confidence with it all. So don't worry about the end point. Just concentrate on each exposure and doing it with the right attitude to break that fear away. You can SO do it. I know you can!! And look into EMDR for the trauma around vomiting- helped me immensely with being able to separate myself from those memories! Please keep me updated!"
emetophobia,f1ded1e,t1_f1db9iu,1569381413.0,"First and foremost be proud of yourself for even leaving today! That‚Äôs huge! Every win is a win. Small steps add up! 

As far as your most recent episode of getting sick- I can understand. My year of horrific panic attacks did the same thing to my brain. But realize that throwing up is always going to be uncomfortable no matter where you are. Same with panic attacks. The good thing about both is the more we do them the easier it gets. Especially with panic because that happens way more than vomiting does! We have to take away our fear of fear- that‚Äôs what perpetuates the disorders. Some great free online resources are available- I follow a ton of great IGs that offer their own resources like that anxiety guy, defusinganxiety, obsessivelyeverafter, and there are so many others! A great place to start. My therapist offers everything he teaches to his clients to download in an easy to digest cd called the anxiety solution series and it‚Äôs very affordable. It‚Äôs literally everything I‚Äôve learned in therapy. He is a specialist in ocd, anxiety, and emetophobia! So I highly recommend checking his cd out. If you can find affordable therapists to work with you on vomit exposures that‚Äôs where I say to spend your money. You could only do a few sessions and really concentrate on those. 

For now set up your own exposures for panic and anxiety like you did tonight! Maybe next time spend 30 minutes at the store, then an hour. Then go to a new store and do the same thing, 15 min, 30 min, an hour. And keep expanding your comfort zone little by little- that‚Äôs what I did! 

And most importantly- the goal is to learn to tolerate the feelings. Wether it be nausea, anxiety, and panic. We have to take away the fear these things cause us, because they aren‚Äôt scary in actuality. Learn about the science behind panic- a great book is by Dr. Claire Weeks- she is the pioneer behind the modern day approach of sitting through the wave of panic. Because the more you consciously observe the physical sensations of panic while not attaching to them- the more you realize it‚Äôs just a beating heart, it‚Äôs just light headedness, separate each physical sensation and just observe. Take away their power. They are only scary because they are all happening at once. You have to learn to anticipate that these things you go out and do WILL cause anxiety and even panic and get in front of it and expect it, be ready for it, ask for MORE of it- because panic is paradoxical, the more we fight it the more it persists. The more we learn it‚Äôs just a big ol false alarm going off in our brain the more we can just allow the wave to happen and know it will pass and breathe through it. 

I hope this helps and let me know if you need any other info!"
emetophobia,f1cha5v,t1_f1cg4yy,1569357582.0,"I know, I feel you, I‚Äôm the queen of avoidance and it only makes the fear and disorder grow. You are just telling your brain that your house is the only safe place which we all know rationally it isn‚Äôt true. My therapist always tells me the only way to break this cycle is by changing your behavior. I know it‚Äôs so hard- I avoided something very important today because I feared it would cause me a panic attack. I am disappointed in myself but know these behaviors take time to break. So if you have the courage to break your fear cycle today please do it!! It will only take you further out of the grips of emetophobia which is I‚Äôm sure what you want!

Please feel free to message me or ask me anything, would love to help!

And yes, sorry, I know it‚Äôs a phobia, but since being diagnosed with ocd which is known as the cancer of mental health disorders, I truly see emetophobia as a disease. The phobia is so insidious in how it spreads to every part of your being- your mind, body, and soul. It has taken every ounce of life away from me at its worst. So while yes it is not classified as a disease I truly see it as one. And I believe that I may never be cured, but I can put it in remission."

depressionregimens,ewqhjqy,t3_cplnok,1565666157.0,"I‚Äôve had a lot of experiences with mirtazapine mostly positive, but I am one of the few that if taken at any higher than 15mg the dopamine effects really got to me and made me violently ill. I tried to stick it out at 22.5 to up myself to 30 but I was so so sick. Very strange and I am definitely in the minority this happens to. But at 7.5 and 15mg it has been life changing. 7.5 saved my life from an ED and made me eat like a ravenous animal. I gained a good 20 pounds very quickly but it was needed and helped stabilize me and propel me in recovery. At 15 initially it was very hard and was my first time being on an AD on a therapeutic dose and it was hard for a good few weeks. Worse anxiety and panic attacks, emotions all over the place, but at week 3 I leveled out nicely. I honestly didn‚Äôt see any AD effects from it until about 6-8 weeks. One day I just noticed wow, I feel like ‚Äòme‚Äô again. Like my brain feels... back to me again. As if the chemicals are properly adjusted again. Before I felt like an alien in a bad dream inhabiting my body and my brain never felt ‚Äòright‚Äô. It feels right again. I do notice some emotional blunting like I can‚Äôt get supper excited about things that I used to, but it‚Äôs not bad. I don‚Äôt cry everyday anymore nor do I feel like crying all the time ha. Just feel normal again. And my anxiety and panic attacks are so much less. But I have to attribute a lot of the anxiety effects more to the gabapentin I am taking. But all in all it‚Äôs a great medicine! Just at the right dose for me haha. Never will I try to increase it again. I did have crazzzzy weird dreams for a few months and night sweats, but they are gone. But again, that may be due to the gaba helping. In any case, seems to be a very popular easy to manage and handle AD for a lot of people. My weight has leveled out at 15mg but I am a little heavier than my normal weight but only like 10 pounds and I am so much more into fitness and exercising now that I have the motivation so I‚Äôm not concerned about it. Let us know how it goes for you! Just know that the first week or two will feel weird but stick with it, it will get better!! Also, once the AD effects kicked in my sexual desires came back and I am able to feel pleasure again. And in more ways than sexual- like food tastes really good, the sunset is gorgeous, just able to appreciate the good things again."

depressionregimens,esqmbar,t1_esqll7g,1562205361.0,"Ya I totally got the weird icky feeling too- but not so much nausea more just like general gross discomfort. I also got a raging headache around day 3. It‚Äôs been almost two weeks for me and the weird icky/high stoned blob feeling is definitely decreasing. I will feel it at around hour 2 after taking it then it levels off into a really nice calm anti anxiety feeling. Really hard to feel panicked. Just feel smooth and relaxed. The anxious repetitive thoughts just... clear. And I thought it was weird I was started during the day too- most people start the med at night. But I take Remeron 15mg at night, so maybe that‚Äôs why? I must have a really high tolerance to sedatives because the gabapentin doesn‚Äôt make me feel tired at all- actually gives me a boost of energy. But my goal is to start taking it morning and night to give myself a constant level state of the drug since it has such a short half life. I assume down the road I will probably dose it 3 times a day like most people. But maybe twice daily will do the trick. It really seems to be helping! It‚Äôs so strange to feel not anxious and not have panic attacks. I‚Äôm actually kind of struggling with it. Because I am so used to it- I‚Äôve never lived a life without it. So I feel... empty almost? Even though it‚Äôs the very thing I have prayed for. So from here on out, it‚Äôs time to take advantage of the help and really get my life back.

And the sooner I try it first thing in the AM the sooner I get it over with. My husband is super supportive and he is around in the AM so I just gotta bite the bullet.

I think I have to ultimately make the choice- do I want to live the rest of my life by my anxiety‚Äôs rules? Or do I want to take a leap of faith and actually get rid of my debilitating anxiety forever? I think I know the answer ‚ù§Ô∏è

Nothing too big or intense and see how it works. Then go from there. Make sure to go to someone reputable and understands trauma and how to coach you- it‚Äôs very important.
antidepressants,esb2u70,t3_c5bi3m,1561776405.0,"I gained a lot of weight when I first started mirtazapine at 7.5mg but I needed to and that‚Äôs why I started it. But once I upped the dose to 15mg (AD therapeutic dose) I don‚Äôt have the insatiable appetite anymore- just normal. No crazy cravings, and my weight has leveled out with exercise. So at higher doses the crazy weight gain doesn‚Äôt happen to everyone!"
depressionregimens,es9o0yq,t1_es84o7q,1561740594.0,Seems like such a long time :( but in reality I know it‚Äôs not. Ended up getting a pretty bad headache last night from it- hopefully that doesn‚Äôt happen for two weeks!

antidepressants,eqaevyd,t3_bxt2xv,1559931575.0,"I too suffered a traumatic week of my worst fear and now a week later my brain has decided to wake up and relive the trauma every single morning. I suffer from emetophobia (fear of vomiting) and had a week long nausea -athon. I too know it‚Äôs 100% psychosomatic because I can tell the difference between anxiety sickness and real sickness. It‚Äôs horrific. I am doing emdr and it‚Äôs helping, but honestly I don‚Äôt know what it‚Äôs going to take to snap out of it? In a way your post comforted me knowing I‚Äôm not the only one going through this. Why must our brains want to make us suffer like this?"
Anxiety,eq0tuzj,t1_eq0swes,1559694230.0,"That‚Äôs awesome that your coping skills worked so well! In a way, I guess mine do too. I had a panic attack today while at home- just I think because my body is still recovering from all I put it through and felt super overwhelmed with everything. So I just sat with it knowing it would pass and kept telling myself I‚Äôm
Not afraid of you anymore, I‚Äôm safe, you can‚Äôt hurt me. And ultimately I made it out ok. Has been a rough day of heightened anxiety- but just relaying to you how well I coped put it into perspective that I think you‚Äôre right, I CAN do this.

We CAN beat this and live again. I guess it‚Äôs having that faith right?"
depressionregimens,eq0tfgb,t1_eq0rrzb,1559693886.0,Ya that‚Äôs awesome so glad it works well for you! It worked really well for me at 7.5 and 15mg. So it may just be higher doses of ANY AD don‚Äôt work well in my body. Going to try the gene testing to see what my next steps are. But thankfully 15mg of mirt is still keeping me eating and sleeping.
Anxiety,eq0rkrp,t1_eq0r3ow,1559692404.0,"Thank you for sharing this! So inspiring to hear. This is what I am working on in my therapy with my therapist. Doing ERP therapy combined with CBT. It has definitely changed my thought patterns and I am able to cope with panic attacks much better. 

And yes I totally agree anxiety is just a human response we all get to live with- yay! But more so I guess I am just afraid that I will think I‚Äôm doing really well and boom go on an airplane or something like that and have a horrific panic attack. Just like... never being completely free from the grips of panic. I guess we all have to take that chance sometime?"
depressionregimens,eq0rbb3,t1_eq0qr4g,1559692199.0,"Oh man I‚Äôm so sorry! It‚Äôs so awful how it makes some of us SO sick, it‚Äôs awful!!

I‚Äôm so glad you have found something that works for you!! I just want to get to that place. And you‚Äôre right- having the gene testing to take out some of the guess work can save a lot of time and energy and ideally save me from nausea!! I think that will be my next thing to do before I even attempt to try another medication.

I just wish for all of us to be free of our demons. People who live without mental illness will never understand the pain and heartache we go through just to have a ‚Äònormal‚Äô day. I‚Äôm determined to get there though. I will."
depressionregimens,eq0r10o,t1_eq0qwhn,1559691976.0,"Ya I tried. I take it at night due to its sedative effects and the last few times I tried I would eat something with it, but no matter what I did I would wake up with severe nausea. I guess I just can‚Äôt tolerate higher than 15mg? So crazy how it helps so many people and unfortunately not me at a higher dose?"
depressionregimens,eq0qq1i,t1_eq0om8c,1559691735.0,And yes will start looking at alternatives- will look into buspar. What has helped you?
depressionregimens,eq0q8o5,t1_eq0om8c,1559691357.0,"Ya that‚Äôs what I can‚Äôt comprehend- how can people live with that amount of nausea for a few months before it going away? I couldn‚Äôt stand it one week!! I tried lexapro last year and as soon as I hit 5mg boom sick. I really think the best bet for me is to try gene testing. I just can‚Äôt imagine putting my body through another ordeal like this.

And thank you- had a little breakdown today about how my life got here and how I am still so young and have so much life to live and I can‚Äôt imagine it being this awful for the rest of my life. I refuse. I have wasted years of my life to this disorder. It‚Äôs summer and all I want is to go to the beach, see my family, see friends. And instead I am suffering. Fuck Anxiety!! I am determined to find a way. 

And maybe the way is fighting it without medication?? Who knows. Sigh. And hugs back!"
depressionregimens,eq0pwxm,t1_enovd9o,1559691105.0,"Well I want to update because holy shit did I go through a lot these past few weeks. 30mg was far too activating so I stayed at 22.5 for two weeks. At week two I got increasingly more nauseous each day. I found this to be so strange due to that mirtazapine is an antiemetic! I asked my dr if it was a side effect and he said yes- so I just happened to be the small minority it happened to. Finally I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore I could barely eat, so I went back down to 15mg last Thursday. The worst part about it was at 22.5 it completely eliminated my panic attacks! It showed me that a lot of my disorder is in fact chemical. I am now terrified to try another AD for fear of horrific side effects. But it showed me that maybe I will have to in fact try another one if I want to ‚Äòcure‚Äô my disease."
AskDrugNerds,eq0llqw,t1_epppxg6,1559687770.0,"Thanks! Ya it‚Äôs crazy- my week from hell almost seemed like a really bad trip. Like the worst drug I‚Äôve ever taken bad trip. Thankfully it‚Äôs been a few days back on 15mg and I don‚Äôt feel constant intense nausea and am eating normally(ish) again. It‚Äôs so strange how it made me so nauseous!! It‚Äôs a damn antiemetic. This showed me I must be super sensitive to AD effects which makes me terrified to try another medication down the line.

But the worst part about all of it is that at 22.5 it completely stopped my panic attacks. They are back at 15mg. At 22.5 the pressure would build in my chest then just fizzle out. Normally a panic attack completely debilitates and disassociates me, not at 22.5. This was a huge eye opener that a lot of my disorder is chemical. And if that‚Äôs the case- that scares me even more knowing that I could do all the therapy in the world and still have them. Which means- maybe I do have to try another AD? Maybe I need to try the gene testing?"
emetophobia,epvpmrl,t1_epvj872,1559544016.0,"I was on 7.5mg for 6 months then 15mg for three weeks, then 22.5mg for two weeks. I went back down to 15mg Friday night. I will continue staying on 15mg for however long? Probably at least 6 more months. I was super happy with this medicine at 7.5 and 15mg. I just now know I can never cross the 15mg threshold!"
emetophobia,epuqda8,t1_epupd24,1559513968.0,"For real!! When I talked to my doctor I specifically asked if at higher doses can remeron cause nausea/v? And he said yes. So I am just in the small minority that it happens to. I think I must just be highly sensitive to antidepressants. When I first tried lexapro last year the first time I jumped to 2.5 to 5mg I got sick too. So low doses for me!! Never again will I try an AD I think. And I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever go over 15mg of Remeron. I got too greedy thinking I could cure myself at a higher dose. Well god laughed at me and showed me what will cure me- a week long nausea marathon. But to clarify, I didn‚Äôt actually vomit (astounded I didn‚Äôt) but even if I did at the worst points I don‚Äôt think I would have cared I was so sick. It was like the worst hangover plus food poisoning plus stomach flu plus motion sickness. All of it wrapped into one. Never experienced anything like it. But yes, I survived!!! No crying!! No panicking!! Just full on coped and did the best I could."
AskDrugNerds,eprohj0,t1_eprn0ih,1559428276.0,"Thank you. Spoke to my doctor yesterday and they confirmed that some people do in fact experience nausea as a side effect so it is most likely that. I highly doubt it‚Äôs the wrong pills? Got it from Kaiser? I have one old 15mg left over from my previous prescription because I did get that thought- what if it‚Äôs the new pills making me so sick? In any case I will call in asking for a new bottle tomorrow. I feel I would also have other withdrawal effects of that was the case. I can still sleep and no headaches or mood change. When I started taking the higher dose I definitely felt ‚Äòactivated‚Äô so I suspect it‚Äôs just my reaction to the higher dose. 

I also suspected that I still felt like shit today because like you said the long half life. Should be out of me by tomorrow?

In any case I will take my one older 15mg pill tonight and maybe after all of this I got a horrible batch of pills? Can I sue if that‚Äôs the case?! Jesus it‚Äôs been hell!"
Agoraphobia,epn5yw2,t3_bv61m1,1559322006.0,"Awesome! I know it‚Äôs so hard to not stop when you‚Äôre finally doing *some things* comfortably. Our disease tells us it‚Äôs good enough, but it‚Äôs not! We have to push every single day. So proud of you!!"
antidepressants,epkb6a3,t3_bv1u1b,1559271518.0,"Thank you for sharing your story! I can so relate about anxiety taking over everything where you get to a point that you are willing to try anything!

depressionregimens,epiqhhg,t3_buq7gn,1559242127.0,"In the same boat as you. I upped my dose and I think it was a mistake, feeling worse at the higher dose. I think I should have stayed at the lower dose longer to assess it long enough- only gave it 3 weeks. Waiting to hear back from my doctor. But looking back at the lower dose when I was put into situations that triggered me markedly lower anxiety. I also felt willing to push myself to do things. At the higher dose I feel agitated and depressed. So I think the rule is when you know- you know. And sometimes at lest for me more isn‚Äôt better!"
antidepressants,epiovcl,t1_epio1tl,1559241632.0,"Thank you, ya it‚Äôs frustrating because my Dr isn‚Äôt really helping. Waiting for a call back- I want to talk to someone qualified enough to give me the educated decision. It‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm taking Tylenol, this is a big deal. I only gave 15mg about 3 weeks, so what I‚Äôm hoping to discuss with my Dr. is 15mg enough to employ therapeutic antidepressant effects? If it is, then shoot I‚Äôll stay on that a while longer. Because I‚Äôm not sure a higher dose is right for me. Sometimes more doesn‚Äôt mean better. Hopefully I see some clarity soon. Thank you for your response! Sucks how medicine is so different on every body/brain."
depressionregimens,ep1ze1p,t1_ep1yjwu,1558999305.0,Interesting. Care to elaborate on how bipolar manifests? I had no idea that could even be a consideration for me. And what is considered ‚Äòhypomania‚Äô meaning what should I look for? I honestly thought that what I‚Äôm experiencing came more from the fact that I have been so heavily sedated on a 7.5 and 15mg dose for months that this increase in anxiety and energy was coming from the dump of noreprenephrine that I haven‚Äôt been used to. And more so more of the ‚Äòworse before it gets better‚Äô in terms of anxiety while my brain and body adjusted to the dose. Yes I‚Äôm contact with Dr. and therapist and that‚Äôs what they have told me- esp since I have never exhibited any signs of bipolar ever.
depressionregimens,ep1uhl3,t1_ep1u2ow,1558996390.0,"No, never. I‚Äôve never exhibited signs of bipolar as I‚Äôve never had really high ‚Äòhighs‚Äô then low ‚Äòlows‚Äô. I‚Äôve only suffered from anxiety and panic disorder and my concurrent depression is solely based on how sad my life became due to the severity of my anxiety. Thankfully Remeron seems to be helping both the anxiety and depression so I‚Äôm hopeful!"
depressionregimens,ep16bic,t1_ep112gy,1558985098.0,"Thank you, this is exactly what I needed to hear. Ya it‚Äôs weird how some days I feel great and I‚Äôm like yes it‚Äôs working! Then I‚Äôll have a day like today where I‚Äôm a mess, spiraling in my negative thoughts. But in a strange way- the anxiety I feel now is less than what I used to feel without any medication? If that makes sense. So I guess I am in fact getting better? I guess I just have to push through this week of uncomfortable adjusting and I‚Äôll be out on the other side. Thank you so much for your reply made me feel SO much better!"

Well, no panic attack and he client and I got along great. My boss even said how great of a people person I am! So glad I pushed through the lies of anxiety!! Ready to do more of this!!"
Agoraphobia,eoekchv,t1_eoej7o9,1558498986.0,"Oh definitely! I no longer have ‚Äòtimelines‚Äô because I did have a date set I wanted to travel by and I ended up like you pushing myself too far and went on an underground subway (to prepare for a flight) way before I was ready and ended up causing myself the worst panic attack since starting my recover a year and a half ago. But without it, it would have never spurred me to such a low to ask for more help which in turn led me to taking a now therapeutic dose of my medication. I never would have taken this medicine at this dose of it weren‚Äôt for my set back. So things do happen for a reason because I am so glad I had he courage to try something new. So now, whenever things happen- they will happen, no rush. But a willingness to keep going day after day because I want to get to the other side more than ever- maybe because for once it seems actually possible?
