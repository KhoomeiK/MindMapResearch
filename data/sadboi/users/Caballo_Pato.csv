depression,fdda639,t3_cml6ni,1578302087.0,"I was doing so good, I find a lot of healing helping others in this forum and then a devastating bad news. All the safe hate is back, I can't stop crying, have to concentrate really hard to keep my breathing stable. This is lasting about 12 hours now. A lot of feelings of self harm, but I am not alone so no high risk. 

I am trying to concentrate in the good but the headache is so strong I can only hate. I feel I am not worthy of being alive. This is a very bad step backwards. Can't reach professional help where  I am. Trying my best to stabilize, warm in bed, dangerous things away. Will cry and rest, try to distract myself. I am such a piece of shit. I can't see anything good and I am paralized by fear and impotece. I know what to do, but too much panic. 

Trying to calm down. We all have bad days, this one is mine."

traumaticchildhood,fd8zaom,t3_ekb7lh,1578225771.0,"I've been where you are. I talked about it and I got silly, awkward replies most times. Abuse it's something that will always be with us, but it doesn't have to be part of us. It's ok if you don't wanna talk, I am just now starting to talk about it, and I will not find a sudden heal just by saying it. But slowly processing it will help, it's a matter to talk to a trained person that can really gide you through the process.

But it's fine if you don't wanna talk about it, you are no less brave, take your time and process it at your own pace. It doesn't own you. And what works for many may not work for you. 

I recomend that you seek a mental health professional, that may allow you to build trust and then slowly at your own pace work the process. You don't have to talk now if you don't want you. We all deal with it different, but I think that my long silence has worsen my sense of isolation about it. And if I could go back maybe I will speak up sooner. But, like I said, do your own process, but know that you don't have to do it alone. 

We are all here to support you when, if ever, you decide to talk about it. 

Hugs to you! And remember, it doesn't own you! Stay strong"

But I think it's not about doing things, is about how we do them. How we deal with not having the skills we dream of, or the time, or the energy. I use those things as stepping stones, like little road markers. Will the kungfu lessons heal me? No. But it helped me meet cool people and I am trying to use it to shift my life and be less anxious about my life. Does it work every day? No, but somedays do, and that is more than I had before. I use it to push me to wake up. Even if my mind doesn't respond every time. 
 
There is no magical all healing activity, just small things we do to ocupy the mind. Is our mindset and the things we learn that make those activities worth it. We all have bad days and lower points in our life, we gotta try not to get stuck on them. Slowly, one day at the time, we will all get better. Don't blame yourself for not being magically healed by hobbies, depresion is persistant, but don't stop doing and loving things. I think it helps a lot, even if it is small..."

I find that hobbies when depressed can be hard because you feel you are nevet good enough. I try to shut down that part and enjoy what little I can do. For example in my kungfu class I am the worse of my team, and that makes me not wanna go, but I try to remember that 6 months ago I could not do what I do now and that if I quit I will never see what I could do in another 6 months. With all hobbies is the same, ""being bad at something is the first step to being kinda good at something"". 

Also don't feel guilty for not doing stuff. Take it easy on yourself, one day at the time we will all get better."

I know that feeling of inmigrant parents getting old and you being totally lost on how todeal with it. I don't know the laws where you are but you can start reading and researching. There is a movement about death talking, death planning and death positivity in USA maybe there is information on their websites about death options. 

With the job problem I can't offer much solution. Maybe try some training program or comunity college? Good luck on the search. 

The social anxiety, take it easy, people care much less than we think. Try not to put so much pressure in your social interactions, people will have an opinion of you no matter what so don't worry. You will meet a lot of assholes, but also a lot of people that will be kind and patient to you. 

Good luck"

Sometimes I fail and I end up just crying or fighting the need to hurt myself. Take one day at the time, enjoy your small victories like ""getting out of bed"" or ""making food"".

I've made the same mistake, many times, but slowly gained the strength to don't pick up dangerous objects when I am having a crisis.

I guess I could say to you two things:

1. It's hard, but try to scape the ""feeling guilty because I am doing nothing so I don't do anything"" circle. When you are ready start with small chores, even if it's smallest thing. Usually that motivates me and helps me get into good Days sooner. 

Today I did a small amount of work, tomorrow will try some more and will face it slowly but steady. It's not much, but I don't wanna go back to my darkest times, so I push it even if my only achivement of the day is washing a dish. 

2. Take care of your health. Delaying issues usually doesn't help. When you can please see a doctor.
