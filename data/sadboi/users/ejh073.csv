mentalillness,fq3w4mi,t1_fq3dryu,1589070983.0,i know people may disagree but this is fairly normal. i’ve heard many accounts of people hearing their name whispered (and only their name) and it turns out to be nothing more than just a little bit of anxiety when they see a psychiatrist. i wouldn’t stress over this too much because it could just make things worse and cause a bigger problem. still should talk to your psychiatrist about it.
mentalillness,fq2z0ko,t1_fq2wy3g,1589061497.0,"for sure, it’s proven to help. even if it’s just a short video or two, it can help clear your mind and create neurological pathways in your brain, which help you learn how to deal with anxiety and stress over time."
mentalillness,fq2x4yd,t3_ggiqs0,1589060864.0,have you seen a psychiatrist or therapist? do you have any sort of diagnosis? sounds to me like that’s definitely something to watch out for if the voices have been common
mentalillness,fq2wk29,t3_ggmwz6,1589060607.0,"i feel the same way nonstop. i want to feel nothing, like what i feel when i’m asleep. i’m hoping it will get better and i hope the same for you; it’s a rough time right now"
mentalillness,fq2wcf0,t3_ggnag1,1589060512.0,"i get this. i feel this way constantly, even before quarantine started and it’s progressively getting worse. since we’re in quarantine my mom won’t take me to see a psychiatrist so i can get prescribed medicine. how much sleep are you getting? i know when i get very little sleep my anxiety spikes. also meditation helps. even if it’s just watching a 5-10 minute video on youtube for meditation or listening to an ambient album and trying to clear your mind. lastly are you smoking weed or doing any other drugs? drugs are an obvious cause of anxiety and depression."

schizoaffective,fpuuxty,t1_fpuuhjs,1588924583.0,"this is probably the best response i’ve gotten by far so i want to thank you for that. some guy told me the other day that i was seeing spirits and a psychiatrist would have told me the same thing if i saw one. anyways, i’m seeing a therapist right now but my mom recently changed the meetings from once a week to once every other week, so every other monday i facetime her. i’ve mentioned my paranoia to her and it almost seemed like she kind of brushed it off a little bit. i need to let her know on monday how bad i really feel and what’s really going on. i know i shouldn’t feel this way but after reading everything you’ve gone through, it sounds like i’m going through a very similar experience and that just worries the hell out of me. i don’t want people to look at me differently because schizophrenia has such a negative connotation. my life could be ruined and i don’t think i’m ready to accept any of that. i still think that all of this might be fake. is there any chance in the slightest that my mind could just be messing with me?"
schizoaffective,fpuulg6,t1_fpuu4vy,1588924244.0,"thank you very much. i don’t want to hurt myself in any way but i think about it all the time. it’s too selfish though. i really don’t know how long it’ll be until i can see somebody, my mom doesn’t have a set date that she’s supposed to go back to work. right now, i’m seeing a therapist and i’ve been seeing her once a week, but my mom just changed it to once every other week to save money ig. i was hoping to talk to her monday about all of this shit but i guess i have to wait until next monday. the last time i talked to her i was feeling very anti-social and i ended up responding with monotonous and vague answers and i didn’t even mention anything important. the meeting before that i gave her some insight into my paranoia and what i was seeing at the time, which was mainly just my door opening out of the corner of my eye and i heard an occasional whisper"
schizophrenia,fputvl6,t1_fpusptl,1588923538.0,"do all types of schizophrenia involve vivid hallucinations? do they usually get progressively worse during the onset? and i get what you mean by the staticky thing, i’ve been seeing random forms of shadowy and light shapes that sometimes look like people or dismembered body parts and they tend to look very unclear and staticky"

schizophrenia,fppsxe1,t1_fpprjq4,1588808522.0,"my hallucinations are for the most part visual. i’ll see these little black dots on my wall just out of my focus that i think are spiders and once i look directly at them they slowly fade. i’ve seen things such as shadow and light figures, a hand coming out of my closet, and yesterday i saw my neighbor’s white cat staring at me through their window but i realized they don’t have a cat. sometimes i even see my door open behind me when i’m sitting at my computer and i turn to look at it and it’s completely closed. this morning i had an auditory hallucination it felt like. i was in the shower and i swear i heard my mom say “you coming?!” i thought about it for a second and i was soon able to determine that it probably wasn’t real. i’ve never known anxiety to cause these sort of hallucinations and it’s really been messing with my head trying to find a cause. thank you very much for the help though i appreciate everything"

schizophrenia,fpmhml2,t1_fpmfzt9,1588733265.0,"i think you’re definitely right here. the part about all of this is that whenever i start thinking that things are going to get better, they unexpectedly get worse. that’s seemed to be the case with these hallucinations i’ve been having. they started off as me just seeing small spiders on occasion but now i’m seeing my door open behind me, hands coming out of my closet, and my neighbor’s cat staring at me through their window. well it turns out they don’t have a cat. i felt like i was isolated even before quarantine, before all of this started i was seeing my friends like once a month or every other month because they’re always preoccupied. i will keep paying attention to my hallucinations and seeing if they persist. i’ve noticed what seem to be slight delusions but i might be wrong. idk if they’re delusions or not, maybe though. also i should mention that my mom doesn’t seem to be fully aware of how shitty i feel. i’ve talked to her multiple times and she’s still planning on waiting until she starts working again to go see somebody. it doubles the price if we were to go now as opposed to waiting for insurance."

schizophrenia,fpmf0uj,t1_fpmdv6b,1588731645.0,"i’ll try my best to explain everything here. i first noticed anxiety in my life when i was around 10 years old. at the time my father had passed away, and i was so anxious and depressed all the time that i ended up plucking out each and every one of my eyelashes. my fifth grade photo was unbearable to look at. at the time, i didn’t recognize that my feelings were anxiety and depression and i was losing my identity it felt like. it was a lot for me being 10 years old. eventually, i got much better. by my freshman year of high school, i felt confident and void of any anxiety. late sophomore year, i felt it creeping back into my life with a vengeance, but i paid no mind to it. instead, i decided to start smoking weed with m friends, and i enjoyed it so much i got a thc pen. i never really used it often until the worst thing possible happened. my 2 closest friends, the 2 people i hung out with and talked to just about every single day, both moved out of state. i was fucking devastated and at the time i had just gotten into a relationship that would make my anxiety skyrocket, but i had no idea. when my friends moved away, i would smoke heavily every day and i would spend every dollar i made from work on weed. my job also stressed me out, i had upset and angry customers on my ass all the time because i always felt like i messed things up. at least that’s how i thought of it. from then on, i smoked more and more and my anxiety began to get worse as the days went on. i have trouble connecting my marijuana usage to my anxiety because i took tolerance breaks often but i still felt just as anxious- maybe even worse. as 2020 started, i thought i was at my lowest point ever. i was slowly losing my motivation, cutting off friends, and i got much quieter and often kept inside issues to myself. from then on it was a steady slope down into where i am now. i began to have more and more suspicions and paranoia as the anxiety controlled my thoughts and my daily life. so all in all, i’ve experienced anxiety and other symptoms multiple times in my life but i tried to keep it as to-the-point as possible. the paranoia and hallucinations are quite recent and i’ve never experienced them before the past month or so. sorry for the massive chunk of text, and thank you so much for your help"

mentalillness,fpm9pib,t1_fpm8yts,1588728435.0,"see a psychiatrist ASAP. that’s what i’m trying to do currently. it’s most likely schizophrenia or some form of psychosis. if you’re schizophrenic, you’ll get medication which will delay the illness a bit and suppress the hallucinations, which is why seeing someone is important."
