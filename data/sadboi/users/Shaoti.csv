AvPD,f4zjs87,t1_f4t0wgd,1571908947.0,"That sounds exhausting. I personally have this thing where I repeat conversations that I've had over and over. My therapist asked me to consider what purpose that actually is serving. So, in my case it is an attempt to alleviate anxiety, to check if what I said was weird or dumb. It doesn't really help, it just makes me feel worse. I've been working on it lately. I notice when I start doing it, I shift my focus from that thought pattern onto something else for a while, something that requires concentration. Like video games, reading or anything else. And after a while the thought of the conversation or situation doesn't bother me as much.

I've been doing that for a few months, and it's actually been getting less frequent. It might seem like an obvious tip, but the thing is that it needs patience. And it's easy to slip back into the habit. I've also been telling myself that it doesn't really matter if I am stupid sometimes. Just let them think that, and it also helps me. 

I hope that tip can help you too. I think understanding yourself and why you react in certain ways can be useful. Maybe just to see clearly the subconscious reasonings to why you need to analyze other people. It could have been logical or useful at some point."
AvPD,f4su60i,t1_f4s152q,1571780914.0,"I was thinking that it causes self-criticism, because of blaming one self for not being able to do what is needed. That can be the case anyway.

But when you think about what is really the cause of the rest of your list, the self doubt, hate. For us with avpd, avoiding stuff is our tactic for dealing with problems. That has turned into the problem, making them and making them worse. 
You don't have to hate yourself, you are not worse than the rest of us."
AvPD,f4pjigs,t3_dlc1ah,1571734154.0,"Thank you for your post. It's inspiring to read about your motivation and efforts. It is a healthy attitude and I think you are on a good path.

I think we can be cured, we can definitely improve our lives to where we are happier. I think it will be a continuous journey, with ups and downs. It may sometimes require patience, but if you continue to work and try new things, you will improve.

I think it can be useful to remind yourself of the things you have done and notice when you improve and things get (even slightly) easier."
AvPD,f4h226p,t1_f4cj9ff,1571587288.0,"Are you doing it to protect yourself? Or is it because you think you deserve praise and admiration? I mean protect yourself from criticism and rejection.
Narcissists, if I understand it right, usually have some sort of grandiose sense of self and entitlement. People with borderline personality disorder experience extreme emotional turmoil, paired with fear of abandonment and loneliness (and a lot of other symptoms). 

What you experience sounds very tiring, and I feel that most of us on this sub can empathize. We are still all different of course. If you ask me, the self criticism doesn't sound like what a narcissist would do. Could it be because of  low self esteem and fear of rejection?

You wrote that you see your family acting similarly, but not consciously. I thought it might just be human nature. We are pack animals, and we naturally want to fit in and have the approval of others. But, of course it depends how extreme it is. You say you were different as a child, but could it be that you were just more confident and possibly less aware of it? 

I probably don't know the answer to deal with your problems. It does seem like needless self-torture,  maybe a bad habit or compulsion (or what to call it) meant to protect yourself. I'm still working on my own self-consciousness in social situations. The best tips so far, that I've received, is to work on social skills and try to shift focus from myself. Try to focus on other people or the situation/environment instead, to break the bad habits.

If you have avpd, the help of a therapist of some sort is apparently a good idea. I just got a new therapist myself, and she is actually the first one to suggest that my recurring problems wasn't just depression and social anxiety. So I'm hopeful that will help with making progress."

You're punishing yourself for seeking validation. Feeling bad about  feeling good. 
What would be good would be to let go of both the need to feel good and the need to be good (perfect?).

But, are you really bad for trying to feel good? 
They do say you have to accept some bad to feel good, accept all of yourself.

Whether you do good or bad things is something you choose, despite bad sides. It's not wrong to accept that you have some bad sides, but you decide if you follow those impulses. And whether they are acceptable, I guess.

For example, sometimes I might feel a bit angry about something and want to seek petty revenge. I accept that I have that feeling, but decide that isn't necessary and find some other way to deal with it. Criticizing myself isn't going to help make that side of myself go away.

The optimal skill would be to be able to laugh with yourself about yourself.

Tldr: Accept that you're human, decide what is good/moral. And I do the same thing."

You may need to try different hobbies to learn more things you can enjoy. Perhaps find ways to try things out before spending a lot of money. There is nothing wrong with exploring a lot of different things.


Of course you could also start exploring the things you usually avoid. Even combine hobby with social interaction. Take a class for example. You won't be bored if you are also challenging yourself."

depression,f19h3d2,t1_f19c8mf,1569272371.0,"You wrote in earlier comments that you have a hard time talking to people. I think you write pretty well. My thought is, perhaps  you could write down your concerns and give it to the therapist (or new therapist). If it's hard for you to talk, then it might be a useful approach. Just an idea.

About the bad first impression, did they say why they thought so? My first thought is that sounds like a mean comment to make, and not helpful for you, especially if they didn't say why.

I probably make a bad impression too, because sometimes it's hard to be all positive and cheerful, and also hard to know what to talk about. The more I overthink it, the worse it gets.

My new therapist is working on a diagnosis with me, and while some therapists say that it isn't important, I feel like it might be for me. I think it could help me learn why I react the way I do to things. Perhaps even realize it's not my fault that I'm like this, you know. Also, it could probably give some direction on how to move forward. Maybe that could be helpful for you too? Come to think of it, a diagnosis should be important before talking about meds anyway, I think."
depression,f1942r1,t3_d7z2ae,1569267566.0,"Did she use the word weird? If so, that seems to me like a sign that she isn't that good at her job. I've had a couple of that kind of therapist. 
Is it possible for you to ask her to clarify what she meant? 
Maybe she just meant that you had unusual symptoms, without meaning to insult you.

Going to a therapist can be hard, especially the first time. It gets easier, at least it has for me. My impression is that you have severe anxiety, so I guess it must have been very difficult. Having experienced some anxiety myself, I think it is very impressive that you went.

She doesn't know you, so she doesn't really know if you are weird or if she should dislike you. If she does, then she is the one who should be disliked. 

About the meds, it is your choice of course. In some cases it can make therapy easier, and the anxiety more manageable. I remember reading that statistics say therapy and meds combined have the highest success rate for anxiety and depression."
