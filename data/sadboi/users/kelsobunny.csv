Which wasn‚Äôt my fault but once I realized I have the power to save money and leave to live with a friend in another state that‚Äôs exactly what I did.

Depression and anxiety really holds you back but when you can rationally realize you can do it you can do it despite how much your brain says you can‚Äôt.  I still struggle with whether I can still do this and take care of myself but I know I can and was the best thing ever. 

As far as creating meaningful relationships after that I find that just being honest about ‚Äúhey I have an issue that makes me feel this way so I don‚Äôt mean to respond  in this way but I‚Äôm working on it‚Äù is something people really appreciate and talking about it is pretty healing when it‚Äôs with good people.
