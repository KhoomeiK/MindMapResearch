AskReddit,fijjian,t3_f7wvsg,1582450906.0,"Sadly, it’s hard to find signs of someone being suicidal. 

I remember going to a counselor in school and telling them about all these negative thoughts and feelings Ive been having. I had to get picked up from school early, and when my mom found out, she was shocked. She always thought I was happy, but I was only pretending to be happy. I pretended to be happy because I didn’t want her to worry about me, I thought I would just be a waste of time to her. I didn’t want anyone to worry about how horrible and lonely I felt.

I also slowly started to isolate myself. Over the past three years, I slowly started talking less and less, to the point that I was basically talking to no one at all. I thought so negatively of myself, and as a result I thought that no one cared about me. One day I started thinking about ways of ending it all without anyone knowing, but I just couldn’t bring myself to actually doing it. The next day I went to the counselor, who recommended me to a therapist. So far, it’s been getting better. 

Sorry for this long post. Here, Ill try to sum it up.

TL;DR: Social isolation and sounding like they’re hiding something"
