That sound like they could be meant exactly for me. However I know that they are not for me. And will never be for me. And reading them breaks my fucking heart. Guess maybe I should turn off my email notifications :( 

With that being said, I hope that you have the courage to do what makes YOU happy. Life is too short to miss out on spending it with people who move our souls & make us feel things in spectacular ways. Best of luck!"

I just want to be happy & share my happiness with my person. If loving them meant losing people because they didn’t understand or were against it because of their own perceptions of life the that’s on them. I’m willing to take that risk. I’ve seen too many people die full of regrets, sad, bitter or just plain miserable. Putting on a show for everyone else to be happy. It’s very possible they could have had a happier ending, some smidge of comfort knowing they followed their heart instead of leaving this world sad & alone because they let life pass them by while living for everyone else. I won’t let that be me. And if that makes me selfish than so be it. 

I hope you find closure if you can’t find the courage to take a risk."

BorderlinePDisorder,f6w62s2,t1_f6vwoqt,1573217679.0,I relate to OP so much & I only subconsciously ever think about if I’m autistic. Mostly because it’s something that I’ve been teased about before. That I could be or I act as if I’m autistic. I’ve never brought it up to a doctor because I suppose that’s just one more diagnoses that I don’t want added on to everything else.

My oldest kids’ father tried to have my kids taken from me by falsely accusing myself & my (then current) boyfriend of abusing one yr old son.  He & his whole batshit crazy drug addicted family & his new drunk gf all called child protective services. He tried to kidnap our son (but not any of his daughters). Threatened to burn my boyfriends family’s apt building do the ground. All type of crazy ass shit. When he couldn’t use the kids against me he abandoned them. 

My most recent ex hasn’t tried anything too crazy, but I have no doubt that once I’m openly moving in he will try to pull something. He kept gps on me months after we separated.

I once dated a guy who tried to impress me by drinking strawberries & cream liquor (we were young) & apparently he was allergic to strawberries & had a severe reaction.

Pouring our heart & soul out into the voids of the universe hoping that it will maybe vibrate our feelings out into the world sending our person back to us in response to our love. Or at the very least make us feel better to get our feelings out of our chest as it grips tightly in its wanting for our person. 

Thank you for your support. I am happy with my life in general. The only thing lacking is to be loved back. But not just regular boring dreary love by someone who is there. But fierce, passionate, can’t live without you, burns your soul to be apart type of love. Because I’ve tasted it & I can’t go back to reliable or safe.

I’ve learned to realize that everyone loves differently so we can’t expect them to love us the way we show love. (Kinda like the love languages or whatever)."
BPD,f1gjd14,t1_f1ggwi1,1569468568.0,"Yeah. Probably doesn’t help that most of my long term or important relationships were seemingly based on sex. Such as my ex of almost 10 yrs didn’t want to marry me or have kids with me. But he sure as fuck wanted to treat me like a dirty whore/sex goddess & show off how beautiful I am. He only changed his mind about kids in the end because I tried to end the relationship. Still ended it almost 2 yrs later. 

My most recent person I thought was going to be this great thing. Possibly a healthy relationship that started off as friends & turned into fwb only for him to go back to his ex. And then keep trying to come back & fuck me. While pretending?  that he cares. (Insert face palm here) FML. That’s a whole other story in itself. 

I was also sexually assaulted as a child so I’m not sure if that plays into it as well.

** edit to add**

Basically all my relationships “proved” that I’m not worthy of love, only of pleasing people sexually. 

But also I want to say that I’ve been working on myself for the past 9 months learning to love myself & know my worth & how I deserve to be treated. I’m shutting down all sexual advances (except from my recent person & even kinda him too til he can get his shit together). And just doing my own thing. It’s a daily learning process, but I’ve come a long way from where I started."
BPD,f1gictg,t3_d8laes,1569467929.0,"Yesssss. Maybe not so much a phobias just an irrational fear. I’m fully aware that I’m crazy with all my disorders. But also underneath all the crazy I’m super logical. Sometimes it can be intense because I need things to make sense to me in a logical manner. I hate being lied to & am overly honest myself. And if it’s not logical it makes me feel delusional! 

With all that being said. I think a great deal of my fear comes from the fact that I was in a relationship with a narcissist for nearly 10 yrs & didn’t realize it until the last year or 2. He lied about all types of things big & small & would turn everything around on me. Call me crazy. It made me start to feel crazy. I could say the sky was blue & he would say I’m wrong. And now I second guess everything as truth or reality because of it."
BPD,f1gge1u,t3_d8w2ey,1569466720.0,I’m the exact opposite. I’m very overly honest/blunt because I feel like people always think that I’m lying no matter what. Is that weird? And I actually have the hardest time trying to tell a lie. I’m just not good at it & I think people will automatically know it’s a lie.
BPD,f1gfzky,t3_d93eoh,1569466482.0,This is something I’ve always struggled with. Definitely think because we want to please people. But as an adult I have learned it’s okay to say no. If it will interfere with your life or put you in a bad position. Then learn to say no for your own mental health/life plans. I still sometimes catch myself saying yes to things that I know are blatant manipulation & I’m working on this all the time.

Like you treat me like I’m a beautiful sex goddess so I’m going to continue this behavior because I get attention (false love/affection) from it. But I want real love, but I feel like people only think of me sexually & when they actually do care about me other then sex, then I always wonder why or what their motive is or when they’re going to realize that I’m crazy & only worth my awesome sex lmao."
