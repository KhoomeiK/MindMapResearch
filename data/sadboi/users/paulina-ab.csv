Also, he’s very overrated and sort of glorified in such annoying ways"
asexuality,fhdg7z0,t3_dlzqik,1581485361.0,"i _aced_ every single class up until they changed teachers. I got extra extra points for remembering the stuff they taught us and I could safely sit in my chair minding my own business. By the end of it we got a new teacher. Things got more personal and she would make us ask her things and say them out loud. This made me sit through rape jokes and whispers about how I couldn’t take shit because “I nEeD tO gEt oVeR iT” .
She asked us at the beginning of one lesson, “Who genuinely doesn’t want to be here?”, nobody raised their hand and I was scared to raise mine because I already knew _way more_ than I need about sex and felt so awkward in a room full of horny teenagers talking about anal sex. I raised it anyways because my friends told me this was my one chance. She said “why?”, I said I didn’t think I couldnt do much in the lesson or be comfortable, “why?”. I nervously told her quietly I’m asexual and I don’t have any questions about sex.  She said that wasn’t a valid reason and I would have to stay. And my classmates just stared and whispered about me. I nearly cried saying it. 
I’m not even sex repulsed, I don’t care much about sex in anyway but it’s like the feeling of being gay in a room full of people talking about heterosexual attraction and sex. (at least from people’s description of that)
I felt so uncomfortable in a room full of allo people after feeling pressured to come out to the whole class in hopes i could avoid dissociating and feeling different/wrong/weird. The whole day I felt drained and any confidence I had left for my sexuality just died.
she did explain asexuality while everybody was distracted and not paying attention but that didn’t help much."

AskReddit,fc752lt,t1_f6hee1d,1577497744.0,"I don’t think you know what asexual means. An asexual person is someone who doesn’t experience sexual attraction to anyone. Not all ace people dislike sex itself, others enjoy it and others hate it. Asexuality isn’t the symptom of a mental illness, it’s literally just not being attracted to people sexually. If an allosexual (someone who experiences sexual attraction) experiences trauma or has a physical dysfunction and no longer enjoy sex that doesn’t mean they are ace. They are different concepts.
And there are also asexual people who go through those things and that doesn’t invalidate them, because if they don’t experience sexual attraction then there is no reason why they shouldn’t belong in the spectrum."
