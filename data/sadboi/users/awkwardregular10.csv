AskReddit,fqhzoym,t3_gixsxp,1589387357.0,"I was an excellent student in high school who was too embarrassed to take a break so I went ahead to university anyway. I wasnt in the right state of mind and I ended up picking CS as a major. It was the most expensive university in the region and the hardest major in the university. I was fucked. My depression flared up. My anxiety flared up. I was sick constantly because of the stress. I would study all day and everyday and barely pass. Not once did it occur to me that I was in the wrong major. At some point I even contemplated suicide. 

Do not rush into university. If you are into a major you seem to have a little passion for, you might be alright. But if you get into university thinking its like choosing a subject in high school its not. You need to have an idea of what you like otherwise you are fucked. I was excellent in math and cs in high school. 

Work and travel. Take up random internships or jobs and consider doing free courses on coursera. Take your time deciding. Do not follow your friends who are on a marathon and think they need to graduate at a certain time.

Self development. Work on it. Invest in it. Be aware of yourself. Learn about yourself. Learn about your mind. Google the best books on self development. Or watch ted talks.

Find yourself before you find your passion.

Do not let yourself be pressurized into anything.

zoloft,fqanrz3,t3_ghp6fk,1589222199.0,"I am a 25F. Started meds for the first time when I was 21 I think. First 2 weeks, I felt brain dead. It wasn't great to be honest. There was so much self doubt and anxiety.  I dont remember that much but I know that I had a shitty time. However, after 4 weeks I saw improvements. They were very subtle so I didnt realize until my therapist asked how I had been feeling. My head was quiet. My anxiety had diminished considerably. I could think things through. I could sleep well. I could study. I could be happy or sad. Or I could just be neutral. I have had an amazing experience with meds. I struggled with a lot of stigma too, especially since I am the only one on meds in my family. It was like my own brain couldn't decide.   
Something my psychiatrist said that has really stayed with me :

You wouldnt hesitate to take a painkiller would you? You just pop one to help with the pain. You know you need it because you have things to do. The same is with these meds. There is no difference. You feel shitty you take a med. Follow through till your doc says you can get off them. She also said that zoloft is a fairly safe medicine.

I hope this helps.

Also I am on 200 mg of zoloft. So hang in there. 

&#x200B;

Also without zoloft I struggled to get out of bed. My head was out to kill me. It was just super hard. But now on zoloft, I am doing everything. Work, studies, friends. Again, I have my days but its easier to get out of feeling shitty. Its easier to make an effort in my life. Its easier to reach out."

There are so many other professions out there that are exploitative. Hell, sometimes I feel like any profession can be made exploitative if the people in it are evil enough.

depression,fpwlg52,t3_gfqlvd,1588965535.0,"I was highly gifted before my depression. After my depression, I am highly ungifted lol. 

It impacted everything - my memory, my attention,  my focus. 

And in turn all my hobbies were affected - reading, writing, painting, community service.

Basically, it screwed me from the front and back.

&#x200B;

Now that my rant is over, let me also share what helped.

therapy and meds were life changing. But I think I let my depression fester for too long. So my lack of attention span that affected my hobbies got me into some bad habits that are hard to get rid off. 

I still do not have the same focus, memory or attention span. Its something I struggle with everyday and with time I realize its something I will continue to struggle with.  


Depression can affect you in unpredictable ways because its something to do with the brain. 

tldr; Yes."

It could also be because I learnt much better coping mechanisms and became more conscious of my thoughts."

At first I went no contact. Once my mental health got better I started checking in with them.

I still feel guilty. I dont know if the guilt will ever go away. They took so much from me and I can think about is being there for them. 

Being in a country where no one lives on their own, means everything is harder. Getting a shared appartment or a job, or trying to be self sufficient....and the cherry on the top I am a woman in a country that doesnt favor women. 

So its hard and shitty. But even on my worst days I dont think about going back.

4. Will not complain or ask questions.

6. Donot interact with friends. 
7. Low self esteem and low self confidence.

It works really really well for me. I wish I had started earlier. I havent seen any side effects. 

However, zoloft alone is not enough. Therapy or self help workbooks, adopting good habits is also very important. Working on your habits and thoughts is crucial.
