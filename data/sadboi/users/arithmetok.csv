LONG time and it still irritates me that it worked, because it sounds like such bullshit, but here it is:

You focus on accepting that you have no control over whether or not you end up alone. You literally cannot predict how any action you take will interact with the rest of the insanely complex and chaotic world. I know you feel like you can, like you just aren’t yet perfect enough for someone to love and if you keep trying your efforts will be rewarded. 

That is a full-on delusion. It’s super common, lots of people share it, we all have our delusions, but it’s not working well for you. You need to challenge that delusion, over and over and over again, until you can get enough distance from it to find out what’s really true for you. 

It’s a really hard one to give up if you’ve pinned your hopes of NOT feeling as awful as you feel all the time on having a loving partner. It can feel like saying ‘feeling good doesn’t exist ANYWHERE in life, so what’s the point.’ I promise you, I’m not advocating for a life without relief from the intense loneliness. 

It’s like this. You can search for your wallet in your backpack, but if it’s in your sweatshirt pocket...it doesn’t matter how thoroughly you devote yourself to turning that backpack inside out...you’re not gonna find your wallet."

Wise Mind allowed my big emotions to be present, but un-linked them from action. There is a delusion in BPD that feeling a sufficiently strong emotion forces immediate action, and labeling my emotions as Feeling Mind helped me defuse from the intrusive thoughts. 

(I always ask for Feeling Mind’s input first, because it’s safer for me to access those big feelings If there’s another task I need to do right after. The brakes I apply to keep Emotion Mind from careening out of control is knowing I need to check in with Reasoning Mind.)

Once Feeling Mind has been acknowledged, Reasoning Mind gets THE SAME AMOUNT of attention as Emotion
mind. Like toddlers sharing a toy — they each get listened to and have their perspective truly considered. Feeling Mind sometimes needs to be reminded that it’s not their turn. 

If I can simply listen to both narratives with the intent not to fix, but to understand, then usually Wise Mind’s opinion becomes clear. 

I think most us already KNOW what Wise Mind would say. it’s just that Feeling Mind and Reasoning Mind are SO insistent to be heard, it’s impossible to focus."
TwoXSex,fr5373q,t3_gmkmxr,1589901688.0,"Hey, as someone who also has abandonment issues and can be alarmingly quick to give my trust away to men, here’s something I find helpful. 

The formula for trust is: experiences over time. 

Tr = E/Ti 


When I first meet someone, I can’t run this calculation, because I don’t have enough data. So I don’t trust people I’ve just met. Even if I’m having a lot of positive experiences with them right off the bat. I still don’t extend trust. This is really, really, really, really hard and requires reminding myself over and over again that if this person has good boundaries and emotional health, they’ll understand what I’m doing because they’ll be doing the same thing. Enjoy the new relationship energy, but don’t extend trust on that feeling alone. 

I know it feels hard to withhold trust because even a fleeting glimpse of safety and relief feels soooooo much better than anything else. I won’t deny that it’s difficult to find things to fill that gap. But it is possible, and the reward is worth it. 

Because: If you save your energy for a person who IS trustworthy, a whole new world of options opens up. It feels AMAZING. it feels so good that you might have trouble accepting that you deserve it, but with practice
you can learn."

solotravel,fr0jdfs,t3_glp0jd,1589797758.0,"Three quick tips for the souk:

1) Stash any purchases in your own bag or take them back to where you’re staying. The plastic bags that a vendor will give you are a signal to other
vendors that you’re buying, and you’ll get a lot more attention. 

2) If you don’t want to engage with someone, don’t speak — shake your head no, give a small smile, and touch your right fingertips to the middle of your chest, and then look down. This is a respectful, culturally appropriate way to say ‘no, sorry’ and it absolutely DELIGHTS most people to see a western woman use it. 

3) ask vendors to bring things out if you want to see them. Avoid going into a stall unless you’re with someone or there are many people in a shop. Never let stand between you and the exit and you can avoid feeling vulnerable, which is exhausting even when nothing happens. Also ‘Shooma!’ Means ‘shame on you!’ And is perfectly appropriate to say if someone touches you with out your permission. Shout it if you need help from bystanders."
Mindfulness,fr0fvv7,t3_gltuwf,1589794170.0,"‘Noticing‘ is a word that tripped me up for a long time. It seemed to indicate that I should be having some
experience so intense that I couldn’t help but be aware of it. 

In actuality, noticing is a skill that takes time and effort to cultivate. 

Imagine you are blindfolded and surrounded by 100 TVs, all tuned to different channels.  Someone asks you to notice what you hear on the radio. 

Huh? What radio? 

To hear the radio, you have to be able to tune out, turn down, or move away from the TVs. 


Tuning out would involve focusing on each TV in turn and identifying the show that’s playing, so that when you hear it, you can say ‘oh that’s the I Love Lucy rerun,  I don’t need to pay attention to that’. This works well for  repetitive thoughts like ‘I’m so stupid, I can’t do anything right, I should jump off a bridge’ 

Turning down is when you hear a TV reporting the news and there’s a big scandal/natural disaster/coronavirus update. You say ‘yes, I want to know that information, but RIGHT NOW I’m trying to hear the radio. This is not helping me find the radio, so every time I notice the broadcast I’m going to say ‘not right now’ and refocus on listening for the radio. 

Moving away from the TVs requires you to have a
second destination. You’re blindfolded, you have no idea about the layout of the area you’re in. If you make up an image of what the area looks like in your head, using past experience, you’ll interfere with understanding the actual layout, dimensions, and contents of the space. So, you start with what you know — there is a floor under your feet. Shuffle sideways. Move toward silence. Move toward silence. Move toward silence. 

Keep doing this, even if you’re moving through room after room of TVs. Trust that there cannot be infinite TVs, and just keep refocusing on moving toward silence."

RelationshipsOver35,fqvoxhv,t3_gkwpw2,1589681917.0,"Making any kind of major change in your personality/habits is brain surgery. Congrats, you’re a brain surgeon. 

The first thing you need to do is decide what you think the problem is. Google adult attachment theory, negative core beliefs, cognitive distortions, and patterns of codependent to get you started.  I also think anyone with relational difficulty would benefit from investigating Complex Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. 

Once you’ve marked out where you want to cut yourself open and dig around, you need to be well enough to survive surgery, and you need to have a clean area in which to operate. Mindfulness is the light that you turn on to see where all the thought germs are in the operating room so you can scrub ‘em up. Fishing can be mindfulness, walking can be mindfulness, meditation can be mindfulness — do some googling and see what works for you. 

If you’re doing everything right but the thoughtgerms are still winning the fight, you may need to hire a professional cleaner (therapist) or get thoughtgerm-busting chemicals (psychiatric drugs).

Some people have systemic infections that won’t go away with a once-weekly treatment — these folks need a steady drip of anti-thoughtgerm, which they can find in intensive therapy. 

Some folks have chronic conditions that are managed as part of their life on the long term scale. 

(I mention these three options because I have no idea of knowing which category you fall into and there’s nothing worse than realizing you need  help and you have no idea where to get it or what that would look like)

Once you’re ready to cut in it’s highly advisable to have the guidance of someone who knows about brain surgery and has seen or assisted in several AND who can communicate clearly and effectively with you. There needs to be trust there. You don’t have a whole operating room full of people to help out — you’re doing bootleg brain surgery on yourself. It’s not fair to make someone who is not trained take this role on, so you’ll want a therapist of some kind. 

You can’t see your own brain clearly — even with clever mirrors. You need a guide to tell you if what you’re seeing makes sense, to identify unexpected anatomy, and to instruct you and give you feedback on your surgical skills and technique. 

Make no mistake: you are the surgeon. You make the decisions, it’s your hand that moves the scalpel or threads the sutures. 

Depending on how the surgery goes and the severity of the problem, you’ll probably need to be extra careful during recovery from surgery, and you may always have a bit of weakness in that spot. 

Good luck. Ain’t for the faint of heart, but it’s worth it."

One need that you have is that you need a condom to feel safe during sex. You could meet that need by buying and bringing conforms. 


But that wouldn’t solve the problem, because you also need to feel like your feelings of safety and security are important to/valued by your partner. Bringing your own condoms won’t meet this need. Forcing him or guilting him into buy condoms also won’t meet this need. 

What evidence, outside of this, do you have that he respects your feelings and cares if you feel safe and secure? I hope you have a lot and this is out of character for him.

If that’s the case, you can say, ‘Look, I know you care about and respect my needs because you do X, Y, and Z. One place that I don’t feel understood, and I would like to, is around condoms — I need them to feel safe and secure, and to enjoy sex. Do you understand that? Cool! How can we make sure there are always condoms when I come to visit?  Amazon subscribe and save? Buy in bulk? You send me cash and I pick them up?’

Imagine that you own a cottage in the middle of the forest. You’ve never seen it,  but your whole life you’ve been told that it exists.

No one has been into the forest in a really long time,
and there is no map. It’s thorny and overgrown and frankly hostile. You can’t get one single step inside the forest.

You can sit outside the forest and be frustrated, angry, despondent that you can’t get to the house you were promised and that is supposed to be yours. 

Or, you can get a machete, and start an arduous journey of uncertain length toward a destination you’re not sure exists. 

Every ‘May I be safe. May I feel held. May I be happy’ is a slash of the machete.

At first, you’re gonna suck at using a machete. It’s going to hurt your hand, it’s gonna be really hard, and it’s gonna feel pointless. And it’s true, in a way— the first many, many strokes don’t move you any closer to your goal. 

But you keep going anyway, day after day, resting when you’re tired instead of quitting, and you find it gets easier. You find a grip that works better for you, and your hands get a bit calloused so you’re not full of blisters. You realize one day that the underbrush, while
still really thick, isn’t as thorny any more. Or maybe you’ve gotten better at noticing and avoiding the thorns?

You’re still not to your cottage, but the forest is a lot nicer than it was at the beginning. 

The point of loving-kindness meditations (which I absolutely loathe, have to force myself to do, AND have been an integral part of my recovery) is not that you say ‘may I be happy’ and the happiness fairy goes ‘poof’ and grants you everlasting joy.

The first step is to achieve physical and psychological safety. That means: not living with abusers and are physically capable of choosing who you interact with and when. (Psychological capability starts later.)   If you’re trapped, use this time to develop a mindfulness practice. This will make everything easier when you escape. 


The second step is to intellectually recognize that your body will not die when you are criticized or disliked. A part of you will die, but your body will continue to exist. 


The third step is to find a mantra that you wish were true, but do not believe. You are enough’ ‘you are perfect’ ‘you are loved’. Ask yourself, how would I feel if that were true? What would I do if that were true?
The  cuddle yourself and have a big cry/rage because it hurts so much to look at the distance between where you are and where those statements are.  Repeat that a bunch until it’s no longer excruciating to admit that it hurts to be where you are and you wish you were somewhere else. Until it becomes just a fact. 


The fourth step is to set aside blocks of time when you will use your imagination to Act As If. ‘I know I’m a completely worthless garbage water person, but I WERE worthy...what’s the next thing I would do?’ not the overall plan or what you would get done today, just the next right thing that a person with intrinsic worth would do. Brush your teeth and ask again. Drink the water and ask again. Give yourself a hug and ask again. Start pretending you have worth. You don’t have to believe it, you just have to put in the reps to blaze a new pathway in your brain. Assume you have to do this 10,000 times before you see any results, but if you do it 10,000 times with complete attention/focus, your brain will change. Every moment is an opportunity to rack up reps.


The fact that it feels false is NOT RELEVANT. 


Once you can regularly Act As If you have worth and value by yourself, it’s time to take your skills into the real world with people you will never see again. Taxi drivers, doormen, baristas (not at your favorite coffee shop), customer service representatives. Assume that they are going to hate you and criticize you, and find a mantra you wish you believed. ‘I can survive criticism
from strangers.’ ‘I do not need to be liked by everyone.’ Repeat the process above: How would I act in this situation if that were true? Take a tiny risk on a day when you can bolt back to your safe place and sleep off the adrenaline surge in your body. 10,000 reps here,
too. Don’t monitor your progress. Don’t check if it’s working. Just do it, 10,000 times. 


Step 6 is to practice Acting As If with people you interact with regularly, but don’t particularly like, and who don’t have the ability to harm you. Annoying coworkers are perfect for this step.

In Step 7, you practice Acting As If with people you’ve just met and people on the fringes of your social circle. You may notice that it attracts people who value themselves, and treat you as if you have value.
It will also repel people that want to treat you like

The LAST place you practice this is with unsafe people.  PhD level shit. Tread VERY carefully. People who have power over you, have abused you in the past, or currently abuse you. Only take this step when:


— you know you have durable  access to physical and psychological safety 


— you have a robust support network


— you are able to consistently and even habitually Act As If, or have started to believe in your own worth.

In my time undercover, I have formed a hypothesis: Tea is not a beverage, it’s a potion. It must be ingested at regular intervals, from quality ingredients, according to precise instructions. It banishes the desire for direct confrontation and smothers the animalistic desire to push and shove rather than forming an orderly queue. 

On a more serious note — it’s a very comforting beverage, especially during soggy weather, and there is perpetually sogginess here. It’s also a way of taking some mindful downtime before transitioning between activities. With an electric kettle, it takes less than 5 minutes to make a cup of tea instead of waiting endlessly for your water to boil on the stove. 

And it has less caffeine than coffee so you can drink more of it and drink it later in the day. You know that feeling you get when you’re looking forward to your first cup of coffee? It’s like that, but over and over again until suddenly your day is done. Not bad."

Codependency = treating someone else as if they are a
god (have the power to give our lives meaning or destroy us, have superhuman knowledge, insight etc.) AND treating ourselves as if we are a god (power to make others feel things, able to help others in ways they can’t do for themselves, etc.) 

We actually don’t have the kind of power over others that many of us were raised to believe. We’re not able to prevent other people from making decisions, getting sick or healing, make them happy or sad. 

Step 1: We admitted we were powerless over others, and that our lives had become unmanageable.

Consider checking out The Human Magnet Syndrome. I found it immensely helpful. 


Most recovery strategies will assume that you are already physically and psychologically safe — e.g. dealing with folks who genuinely want what is best for you. 


All due respect, it doesn’t sound like that is your reality. 


I have thought long and hard about this. I am not a medical professional, but I have been through a version of what you’re describing. The advice I would give
to my past self is: get to safety. Set your sights on safety and fight tooth and nail to get there. You’re gonna need a LOT of rest once you land. Your overall functioning will appear to go down.  But if you can get yourself to a place where your amygdala feels safe and secure, then your body can start healing itself, and your mind will follow."
dbtselfhelp,fpcvnyf,t3_gcoi29,1588513928.0,"I would look to resources about dealing with narcissists. I’m not diagnosing your family — everyone has at least some narcissistic traits. Narcissists cope with the emptiness inside by getting a reaction out of other people. They provoke other people because it feels good to them to see that they have the power to make others react. Remove that power not by wrestling them for it, but by stepping out of the way. 

‘Observe, don’t absorb’ is the mantra. Ask yourself, ‘if I turned the TV channel to watch this show, what would I think about the characters? The action? The plot?’ 

Detach, detach, detach yourself — for your own sanity. 

Boundaries are different with different people, and one definition is: the distance at which you can love yourself and the other person at the same time.

The boundary discovery process goes like this:

The next time you’re getting worked up about this, take some time to say or write (to yourself or in a safe therapeutic relationship, not to your family yet) ‘What’s true for me is...’ and then finish that thought. 

First, you UNCOVER the boundary that’s being crossed. ‘What’s true for me is I feel humiliated and disrespected when my family calls me crazy. It really hurts and I want it to stop.’

Then you DESIGN a new boundary that works
for you. Important: your boundaries only control
YOUR behavior. It’s really important to find a boundary that makes the knot in your chest unclench when
you think about it — it has to be something that sounds AMAZING in order for you to honor it. That might be: 
‘I do not participate in conversations where people are calling me crazy.’ 

Then you figure out what you’re going to do when the behavior happens again. ‘If my family calls me crazy, I am going to get up and leave the room. I will self-soothe in my room for 1 hour or as long as I need before coming downstairs, so I can show up in a way that I’m proud of. 

Then, you INFORM them of the boundary the next time
they call you crazy.  There’s no need to fight about it or
convince them  — you’re simply telling them what will happen. 

‘I’m not available for this conversation if you keep on calling me crazy. You can either stop now, or I’m going to leave and we can talk later. Now, what were you saying?’ 

Then, PROP UP your boundary by doing what you said you were going to do.  Again, no emotion necessary here. You told them what you were going to do, and now you’re doing it. That’s all. 

You’re not hurting them or damaging them or disrespecting them by ending a conversation. You’re HONORING your boundaries, and it really has nothing to do with them. 

Hang in there!"

First, I draw an uppercase version of the vowel somewhere else on the screen and make them say JUST that — as if they were reciting the alphabet. 


‘Say I’


I correct pronunciation there first. If they are making a short vowel sound, say and hold the long vowel sound while counting to 3 on your fingers. Then make them copy you. They won’t be able to do it and make the short vowel sound, they’ll have to switch to the long vowel. 


‘Say I....’


Then I segment the word, starting at the end, and again exaggerating the length that you hold the vowel. 

‘Say I...ke’


Then I go back to the word that triggered all this and I rewrite the word with a capital letter for the vowel sound, and I segment it out.


‘Say m-I..ke’

‘M-I...ke’

Don’t let them speed up/blend until they’ve said it correctly and slowly. You’re teaching their mouth a new movement sequence, if you speed up to soon muscle memory will take over and it’ll be back to ‘mek ’ instead of ‘Mike’"

— using primarily circular motions  rather than thrusting (think screw, not nail) 

— as you warm up, every minute or two give
yourself a break by completely removing the penetrative object for 30 seconds or so — there’s nothing like taking penetration away that makes your ass realize how much it wants it. 

Also, it doesn’t have to be separated into ‘prep time’ and ‘sexy time’. I’ve taught my partner everything I know about how my ass likes to be prepared for deep penetration, and now I can hand the reins completely over to him.

so, and In situations where my most extreme emotions are triggered, my only goal is still to not harm myself, someone else, or my future. 

You won’t change, not exactly. You’ll become more skillful, able to keep your head above water. You’ll move closer to the shore.
