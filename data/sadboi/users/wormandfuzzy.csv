GenderCritical,ey6g4f5,t3_cvtap4,1566854798.0,"Yeah, i thought i was asexual my late teens/early 20s for similar reasons. Then I started having sex out of curiosity/peer pressure and it made everything worse, destroying what self esteem I had left and aggravating all my depressive tendencies. Obviously with the problems I was coming from I wasnt set up for sexual ""success"" as a young adult. I do not think I'm actually asexual but i see how its appealing to have what sounds like a wholesome, healthy, unintimidating reason to give people for lack of a sexual or romantic life.  And personally I felt like everyone was always demanding a reason, like they were upset I wasnt well adjusted enough. 

Womens sexuality, *my* sexuality feels like a war zone to me sometimes. Every answer feels like the wrong one. I just wanted to take myself out of the running in a way, like calling myself asexual would have to force everybody to stop passing judgement on my choices because it was simply my ""orientation"" (fwiw I was never of the mind that ace was LGBTQ+ in any way but I thought my sexual repulsion was the way I was born and not rooted in shame like it actually was, thus ""orientation""). Of course that's not true, nothing can do that. But I was definitely just trying to protect myself because I didnt (and still dont) know how to unpack all of my issues in a world that seems annoyed with me for having them. 

Obviously I cant speak for everybody but i do wonder a lot how other young women are arriving at the conclusion, especially since it seems like a growing thing now. You cant ever really know what's going on in somebody's mind about their sexuality or anything that might have influenced them in whatever way.

The other comments in this thread about it feeling like some grand MRA conspiracy to squash our rights sound dramatic at first glance but when you realize the impact of their language policing and overall litigiousness... it paints a picture of a terrible future. 

I took a queer theory class once and at the end of the semester the professor asked ""what do you think is the future of queerness"" (whatever in the fuck that means) and I wrote in my notebook that eventually ""woman"" will no longer exist, because it will be replaced with some double plus good think string of gender words so everyone feels *valid*.

Also, a bunch of them probably have no souls whatsoever and cant imagine relationships as anything other that transactional. These men couldnt feel love for anything if they even tried.
