deadbydaylight,foh2vyj,t3_g7fcuu,1587759907.0,I feel you... a stupid ass survivor once wrote me on PSN “give me a challenge next time”. I bet that retard failed pre school haha
deadbydaylight,fmlkcy8,t3_fvbtii,1586188115.0,"I don’t mind getting tbagged by survivors, that’s not what pisses me off. what really pisses me off are those 12 y/o red ranked dicks who play against a level 17 killer and think it’s cool to leave comments like “give me a challenge next time lol” on my PSN. I’m pretty sure your mum tried to abort you with alcohol and drugs because you’re freaking retarded man"

AskReddit,florvbq,t3_fq6422,1585344209.0,"Since January I have a new job and it feels like some of my colleagues still did not accept the fact that I’m new on the team. I don’t want them to like me, I just want them to respect me and the fact that I’m now their new colleague. 3 months later I’m sick of trying to be nice and friendly but it’s really hard for me to lay that behaviour down. Do you guys have any tips on, you know, how to stop caring? Unfortunately I tend to  take things personally..."
