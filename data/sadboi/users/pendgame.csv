Prior to this, I had alternated workweeks of OMAD and 5.5 day fasts (for months), but I started having problems with dizziness and nausea near the end of my longer fasts. Switching to this protocol actually means one fewer meal in a 2 week period, but I feel better. One negative is that I find myself hungrier. On a 5.5 day fast, I can ""settle in"" and my hunger goes away. This is more of a yo-yo."

At the advice of my foot specialist, I had the joint in my big toe fused: they cut the bones and pin them together. I was nervous and skeptical, but he said that if I wanted to keep mobility, it was the way to go, and what he advised for younger patients. Recovery took a solid 10 weeks, but now, after a few months, my foot is great. No pain in any toes or from the surgery. I can walk a few miles until something else gives out; my feet are fine. I can wear a 2.5 inch heel comfortably. The only down side is the ugly scar, but that will fade."

I see it this way: I'm also someone who went through cancer, and the usual way to explain that situation isn't to say I'm cured, but to say that I  have no evidence of disease. I do not have cancer. On the other hand, I may not be binging or purging -- I have no *external* evidence of disease -- but in the way my mind works, my ED is still there. The urges still crop up. I have to be careful of triggers. I recognize some behaviors as dangerous. Whether or not I'm acting on it, I still have an eating disorder. 

I'm hoping that will change, but this life, with an ED that is controlled, is a good life. It requires self-awareness and occasional course corrections, but those get easier with time and this is manageable. Hang in there!"

They were independent but information sharers, not hoarders. They were learners; whether pursuing a degree or passionately digging into a hobby or brushing up on a second language, they saw learning as part of their lives. 

There's a person on my team now who doesn't have a degree or a technical background, but is an obsessive note-taker who reviews things until she understands them, asking lots of insightful questions. I hired her because of those questions: she can get to the core of any situation and she's humble enough to ask for help.

It's one of the best-rated places in her area and she spent time on a waiting list to get a bed there. She's been there for 4 years now and it's good, but let's not kid ourselves about the standard of care -- it's pretty grim. My mother has often had to be her advocate, especially as her health has deteriorated. Things have been stolen from her room, if she has nice clothing it vanishes in the wash and never comes back, and she rarely gets help in time to make it to the bathroom before soiling herself. That said, there are some people who really care, she's safe, and she has lots of opportunities to engage with others. Gram is losing touch with reality nowadays (she's 103), but she's been happy there.

She's not allowed to have any money at all. When she went into the home, *everything* in her accounts had to be turned over (she was allowed to pre-pay for her funeral). I think she's allowed $50/month, which is controlled by the social worker at the home.

It might be helpful to advise instructors to monitor their online reviews and quickly address comments like those.

My instructors and the studio I chose were fantastic. Size, age, and condition friendly in all of their classes (the place also has straight exercise and dance classes). However, sometimes my sweetest instructor would say things that just weren't helpful. There are positions where depth is controlled by the shape of one's body; if I'm seated and folding forward over straight legs, my stomach is going to interfere before I reach the limit of my hamstrings or back flexibility. My instructor would try to push me deeper in a gentle adjustment, and I'd point out that it was my body in the way. She'c smile, try to push me down again, and say that my body was beautiful.

I have ankylosing spodylitis and was born with hip dysplasia, so I already have a hip replacement and a metal plate on my tibia at age 49. To me, this joint fusion was no big deal. I wasn't supposed to put weight on it for 6 weeks, then limited weight for 2 more weeks. At 10 weeks it's a little tender but I can walk just fine.

I cried a lot as the noise poured back into my brain, all the little nudges to binge and endless negotiations. I regained every pound I lost and then some.

This year I've regained control without medication by using intermittent fasting (usually OMAD - one meal a day) and I've lost all of the weight again. For me, having a hard time limit on when I eat and when I don't makes all the difference. Nothing is forbidden, which is less triggering, and I do much better with an eat/don't rule than making fresh decisions with every bite.  Most people who follow OMAD eat a full day's calories in one meal, which can be an easy transition for someone with BED. Many people on IF still follow specific eating styles as well, whether raw vegan or keto carnivore. 

It's trendy right now, but I've met a lot of other IF/OMAD/fasting people who are recovering from EDs of one type or another. Of course, don't start anything drastic without consulting with your treating psychiatrist. :)"

(I should add that none of us work out of the same location, so even if we go to the office, we're working independently.) I'm in the 40% because I like my office and find I can concentrate better on some types of work there, plus it keeps me plugged into shifting office politics.

In our case, a lot of remote workers got that way when the company -- a large international one -- closed down a regional office, but decided that a particular person was too good to lose and in a role that could be done from home. It certainly isn't true of all jobs; many positions at my company are hourly and require workers to clock in and out at their office computers."
