If you're interested I have found that ayurvedic medicine is really good for stuff like that. Its an ancient medical system from India that includes diet, exercise, yoga, and herbs. Its honestly the best thing I ever did for my anxiety.
I know meditation can be really helpful but sometimes if you have mental illness due to trauma or if you've been diagnosed with PTSD it can cause you to dissociate."

relationship_advice,ff6zbci,t3_erv3gx,1579637978.0,"Hey,
A lot of americans are like this. But they are assholes and there are better people out there who will respect you more. I think you should dump him and find someone better."
ptsd,ff6srm0,t1_ff6qqez,1579634122.0,I don't know if I can even trust people. I'm like legit gonna become a hermit and never talk to anyone ever again.
ptsd,ff6popm,t1_ff6nvxu,1579632278.0,Thanks. I wish I knew how many people and who exactly is involved. I feel like I have to just like dip out and not tell anyone. Like dude I'm so fucking tired of this shit.
herbalism,ff649p7,t3_erdsfn,1579618755.0,"They viewed me as a hypocondirate because I told them I started having seizures shortly after taking the medicine they prescribed me.
The medicine they gave me is supposed to work well for pcos. 
They thought I was exaggerating my symptoms because they believe really hard in the medicine they gave me.
Once I stopped taking that medication I haven't had a seizure since and many other symptoms improved as well.
So that's why I don't think I have it since the medicine they gave me made everything worse."
herbalism,ff63wij,t1_ff63jak,1579618497.0,"I don't feel like you're listening to what I am saying. I've been trying to get this same test for 10 years. 10 years worth of doctors have refused because they don't think I need it. 
I do need it if I want to get the type of treatment I am trying to get because the herbalist needs specifics when it comes to hormones testing. 
I'm not really arguing with you cause like this has been my consistent experience throughout a lifetime. 
Its just frustrating you know when I am having literally seizures from the medication I'm taking and the doctors won't take me seriously."
herbalism,ff59tkc,t1_ff39epw,1579584593.0,"My issue with your comment is that you are making a lot of assumptions about my experience. 
This is something I've been trying to do since I was a teenager. Every doctor I've seen over the past 10 years has refused to do hormone testing."
herbalism,ff44tf7,t1_ff39epw,1579555552.0,I've gone to multiple doctors who have refused to do it.
herbalism,ff3wcjy,t1_ff3qbyl,1579550280.0,I don't really have the money to be picky. Can they order blood work.

He may be a good person deep down, idk but that does not give him the right to put you in danger. You don't have to call the cops but you need to get out of there. Even if you have to go to a shelter. That type of behavior will only escalate."
relationship_advice,fc9bvu6,t1_fc9brkt,1577550272.0,We already moved in together. Like she was gonna be literally homeless and was living with someone who is known to be violent.
CPTSD,fbbjirj,t3_ece9ob,1576701763.0,Its not an excuse to be abusive
relationship_advice,fb6ftcs,t3_ebj5gl,1576549222.0,"You have to apologize and you have to be humble about it. I would suggest doing more research on racial issues overall before talking to him to make sure you have a good basis to understand exactly how you were wrong. 
He is not entitled to forgive you but he might tolerate you for the sake of your daughter. 
I think the best way to earn forgiveness is to change your behavior."
ptsd,f8l7oj8,t3_e0q2p1,1574619312.0,It pisses me off too. And its always people who are super up the ass of veterans but have never served and who also don't give a fuck about vet resources.

My advice is to dump his ass and find a nice therapist."
MentalHealthSupport,f8l69ls,t3_e0rrpi,1574618871.0,"I'm sorry your parents aren't reacting in the right way. You should be supported during this time. 
Counseling is honestly pretty awesome if you get the right person. 
I know it might not help a ton. But if it gives you any peace of mind, know that all bad things will eventually come to an end. Whatever is bothering you right now will not last forever and I truly hope you're able to feel better, even if for a moment. 
I don't think your  parents emotions are your responsibility right now. Just focus on what you can do to make yourself feel better"
CPTSD,f4o39cc,t3_dl6tae,1571695886.0,Thats real. My big issue is that I knew exactly what I was getting into with people but my love for them overshadowed my self value so I'd just let them hurt me over and over because of my lack of self worth lol.
CPTSD,f4o0luj,t1_f4o0e2f,1571694942.0,To be honest. Like I haven't been all the way. Like I have not endured serious physical harm for about a year. But there have been threats made towards me and aggressive behavior and betrayal.
paganism,eyinrba,t1_eyim8iy,1567104931.0,You shouldn't feel bad. If you're a shitty parent than that is what happens. I've also been diagnosed with ptsd. Its rough.

Emotions are weird."
CPTSD,ewv0b52,t3_cq0f61,1565795795.0,"I've definitely had this issue. I've tried to flip my thinking on it. I can still have compassion with these individuals while also keeping them at a distance. Its rough sometimes. I've just ended up cutting people off completely who try to abuse me.
But easier said than done. I don't think its bad to want to see the best in people but not at the extent of our own safety."
CPTSD,ewfk6zr,t3_cnq3er,1565362686.0,I like the phrase. I feel like it would help me
ptsd,ewc3wah,t1_ewc2o2e,1565277522.0,"Honestly. Same though. I don't want to call them out for it because it seems like they are insecure about their own issues so they are hyper focused on mine. 
Like I don't even feel safe talking to them when I am having an issue tbh"
ptsd,ewc2gii,t1_ewc274b,1565276638.0,I will try that. Its difficult because we have been living together.
ptsd,ewc20k0,t1_ewc1uge,1565276364.0,I don't know how to approach the conversation. Sticking up for myself is not my strong suit.... Hence the trauma lol

CPTSD,eugsfh9,t3_cgf030,1563814018.0,Yeah. Mostly I feel guilty for allowing myself to get hurt ya know?
relationship_advice,eu3eldj,t3_cefc95,1563412618.0,"So I have PTSD from rape.
Its really hard to get out of that cycle. I think its good to continue to be supportive but also you are allowed to discuss how this affects you.
Don't lead with the sex thing. Tell her how much you love and care for her and how you want her to be better for the relationship overall.
No blaming, don't threaten to commit her.
She does hella need to go to therapy though. Like honestly I wish I could give you my number to give to her because it might be hard to convince. Do you know why she doesn't want to go to therapy? Or is she just so depressed that she can't get out of bed? 
Idk dude open and honest communication but still be respectful of her feelings without blaming her.
Maybe try a therapy app?????"
