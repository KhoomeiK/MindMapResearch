Unfortunately you can’t really do anything other than be there for her when she decides she wants to change. There is a very strong likelihood this is just the very beginning of a long long road of pain and addiction, riddled with jails and institutions, and for many of us, death. You can only love her as your friend and try to take care of yourself as you watch her waste away.

But, maybe she will come to her senses. But from my own experience, it took a whole lot of repeat trauma, deaths, ODs, jail, countless hospitals, prostitution, homelessness, and sickness to get to the point where I knew I had to change. And it is still incredibly difficult."

I haven’t had a single craving since I got clean this time which is UNHEARD OF for me. Normally
I’m fielding and making myself sick from cravings. The last time I used I accidentally shot WAAY too much coke and had a grand mal seizure in an alley and my friend left me for dead. I came to unable to move my limbs and I was sooo sick for 4 days from that one shot. I think I almost died or had a stroke or something really bad.

Then I decided to come back to the rehab I was in before.  I had about 5 days of acute withdrawal and no sleeping again, and then on day 7 I felt fine, and have felt totally fine ever since. It's kinda weird actually. Like I don't have the crippling depression that I did previously. It will most likely resurface soon, but as of now i'm two weeks clean again from everything and I feel pretty good. Way better than how I felt 6 weeks off of the subs. Kinda strange."

Shooting coke gave me the crazy rush and excitement and feeling high, even if it only lasted for a few minutes. But I would inject coke like every 10 minutes, and every shot would get bigger and bigger until I was doing .5gram shots and convulsing and ending up in the hospital every other day. I really don't know why i would do such big shots because I would always panic and think I was gonna die and then I would come to from another seizure. For a while I really thought my brain was severely damaged, and now I wonder what my cardiovascular system is looking like... but when I am clean I try to exercise everyday. I think the fear that I had already irreversibly damaged my body and mind from the coke ODs kept me getting high and being so wreckless for a long time. Like I was really using with the passive intention that I was going to OD and die. 15+ ODs later I'm still here and the last one, right before I collapsed I had this profound realization that I actually wasn't ready to or don't want to die yet. I realized I need to get clean and try to make something with my life before I will be content with dying... I digress. It's cool to hear from you guys because the only people I know who shot coke are dead. I used to have homeless junkies and prostitutes in the hood of west baltimore telling me I need to chill out the way I was shooting coke, like they were disgusted by me even tho we were all doing the same thing. I just had another insane level of compulsive recklessness I guess. . That shit is THE FUCKING DEVIL to me!"

StopSpeeding,fmk6kt5,t1_fmi7cf0,1586145849.0,"thank you! I honestly feel pretty weak at the moment, I would still be shooting coke if I wasn't in the middle of nowhere at a rehab facility! These cravings are really bad. But I've been trying to get clean for ten years so hopefully this is the last time!"
OpiatesRecovery,fmk61kq,t1_fmk3u07,1586145455.0,hmm don't think so i probably have PTSD from a bunch of other shit tho lol. But yeah probably didn't help me out much. The nurses and doctor didnt believe me when I told them until I recited the conversation they were having.
OpiatesRecovery,fmjzpqg,t3_fvh2go,1586141119.0,"I woke up in surgery once, that shit was literally something out of a fucking nightmare. I couldn't move or anything to let them know I was awake either, and yes, I felt pain. that shit was FUCKED."
OpiatesRecovery,fmjqyz4,t1_fmiu1yu,1586135917.0,"Thats my biggest problem is the speedball w/ coke. The coke cravings always take me back out. I wish I never shot coke, it makes my 10+year heroin addiction look like child's play. Are you clean? How did you get over the IV coke rush, that shit really haunts me. I have 6 weeks away from everything but only because I got intervened on after shooting a couple ounces of coke in about 3 weeks, ended up in the hospital several times with seizures/ODs and sepsis from disgusting hygiene and using the same needle about 60+ times a day sometimes shooting coke every 10 minutes."
StopSpeeding,fmhv3mp,t1_fmhuby1,1586094362.0,"I've been an IV heroin addict for 10+years, but my heroin addiction was NOTHING compared to what happened to me once I got that first bellringer coke rush. There's literally nothing to compare it to. It's the rush that I was basically chasing to my death.  I hope you get clean somehow, be careful. I know how hard it is trust me I've relapsed a million times and this is my 13th rehab (kinda lost count), I'm just gonna try and stick it out for a year this time and see if it gets easier. The coke cravings always take me back out."
StopSpeeding,fmht3ch,t3_fvd4p5,1586092705.0,"I can relate, my worst addiction is shooting cocaine/crack. I know how addictive the rush is. I've had countless seizures shooting half grams of fire at a time just trying get the biggest rush humanly possible to the point where I thought I lost my hearing permanently. Ended up in so many ER's with them telling me if I shoot up again my heart will stop as it can't take the constant assault from shot after shot of coke. The cravings are ungodly. Sometimes I dream that I'm shooting coke and I wake up in a sweat and panic, sorta feeling tweaked outta my mind. I can taste it and everything. It's a fucking BITCH. But i have like 6 weeks clean today and it's getting better."
OpiatesRecovery,fmgub23,t3_fv5xfn,1586058024.0,"Just for some hope for you - I jumped off 12mg cold turkey 6 weeks ago. And I also was coming off a pretty INSANE IV cocaine/heroin/meth/valium/ketamine/LSD/MDMA bender for the prior 6 weeks, and jumped off my lexapro. I never thought it would happen but I am basically feeling totally normal at this point. The back/neck pain almost drove me insane I thought I was doomed to be a mess of pain and anxiety forever after that, but the body DOES recover"
REDDITORSINRECOVERY,fm0jpi8,t3_fs8tw2,1585659606.0,i have this and can't stay clean because of it... i'm amazed you've got two years that's awesome. How did you cope?
REDDITORSINRECOVERY,fm05ps7,t3_fs6tv3,1585645757.0,"I feel this, I get real extroverted and outgoing, end up messaging random people on social media, posting dumb shit , just like my whole personality changes."
REDDITORSINRECOVERY,flzmekx,t1_flz9s40,1585627295.0,"Yeah it's definitely a struggle just feeling my body again, and I don't really like how it feels. I feel like an old man now, definitely don't have the energy and lack of pain that suboxone gave me. It's also just an adjustment not being able to take anything to get any type of relief, everything is so slow-release now haha, like meditation, yoga, exercise, changing my thinking, when what I really crave is just instant gratification. I have come close to slipping a few times of feeling like I can't take sobriety anymore, but I am on day 33 or something I guess thanks to being at this 'rehab' in the middle of nowhere. I feel like I might be stuck out here too for an extended period with this fuckin virus. Anyways, I've been pretty useless really just spending most of my time distracting myself with mind-numbing things so I don't focus on how lethargic and anhedonic I currently am, or the body pain, or drug cravings. But today I'm feeling relatively decent and like maybe I can stay clean afterall. It's a constant 2 steps forward, 1 step back kinda thing. This is def the hardest thing I've ever done. Psychological warfare in my head most of the time, and extreme existential boredom. My brain is BEGGING me to run away from this place, pawn everything I own, and shoot a speedball, but this is basically my last shot of ever leading a decent life, so I have refrained so far. Not easy by any means. I hope you recover from the month of shooting subs, everytime I shot subs it would make me feel very sick, so if I really needed to make subs stretch I would just snort a piece of the film, or when I was locked up people were putting tiny pieces in their eyeball, like .1 mg in the eyeball were getting people pretty fucked up, but that sounds painful and maybe worse for you than the IV'ing. But IV'ing subs made my veins hard af and felt like bones, probably not a good ROA! Be careful !"
REDDITORSINRECOVERY,flzli43,t3_frx53k,1585626618.0,"I'm a 27 y/o male but I've gone through the wringer with my coke addiction (although mine was mainly IV coke, but I can tell you the cravings for it are unlike anything else, they pale in comparison to every other drug craving I've ever had. They make me physically sick just thinking about it. I'm 35 days clean."
REDDITORSINRECOVERY,flvwsxm,t1_flvjnkn,1585533972.0,yeah if this virus didnt shut everything down i would definitely be trying to get into a different facility the one i am at seems very lacking in care
StopSpeeding,fltpk9k,t3_fr4ghh,1585482778.0,"i feel you. Im 31 days clean because I kept overdosing on IV coke and ended up in the hospital 4 x in a couple weeks, I also jumped off a house and slipped a disc in my lumbar spine, couldn't get out of bed for days. Now that i'm feeling somewhat 'healthier' i'm like wait, i just overdid it a little bit, i don't need to totally put this all behind me. but that's just a straight fuckin lie. I almost relapsed yesterday but today I'm feeling more committed. Drugs are not good for me and I will never do the things I wanna do in life If i keep drugs in my life."
OpiatesRecovery,fltcou5,t1_flt3nma,1585467313.0,"Thanks for the response. It gave me some hope. I'm just so beat down right now I've been trying to get clean for 10+ years and every run something really terrible happens. SO many hospitalisations and OD's, and my life turns to shit immediately. The only reason I'm 31 days clean right now is because I came to this rehab 4 hours into the country in the middle of nowhere to detox cold turkey, and I'm here for another 4 weeks. But my cravings are getting so bad and I'm losing the desire to really try recovery again, and that makes me sad and feel hopeless. The only thing that makes me feel any type of positive feeling is thinking about shooting speedballs which is super fucked. IDK maybe my mind will start to shift again back towards recovery, i'm just in a dark place and not sure how ANYONE gets through this. But I have got 9 months clean before in AA/NA a couple times, so I guess I have it in me somewhere... I just can't seem to connect with that part of me right now."
OpiatesRecovery,flsrq3p,t3_fqx4jq,1585449145.0,Any tips on how you made it? I'm at day 31 and really struggling.
REDDITORSINRECOVERY,flqjze3,t3_fqffk7,1585397691.0,"If I were you I would NOT tell people in the fellowship, maybe tell someone super close to you if they would understand. But in my experience having everyone start treating you like you're one day clean again is more detrimental than just learning from this and moving on if you can move past the guilt and shame. A couple swigs of sherry and then feeling guilty about it is not a relapse, and IMO it hardly counts as a lapse, as I'm sure your addiction looked nothing like this in the past. Best to move on and learn, and keep your head up and don't reset your clean time because that will just create a whole attitude that you have 'failed', which you haven't since you dumped it."
funny,flq6i9d,t1_flppgf5,1585381134.0,this bothered me way more than it should have
OpiatesRecovery,flpirny,t1_flpak1p,1585360453.0,"daaaamn bro, did it just rupture one day while you were lifting something? Or was it just progressive over time the pain got worse and you got it checked out? And did you do any physical therapy? I'm pretty interested because during my last relapse (have 30 days today) I shot a whole bunch of coke and went into psychosis and jumped off a roof and landed on my feet and one of my lumbar discs got squished outta place and is now bulging out and been dealing with the fallout from that. Waiting to get an MRI to make sure its not herniated but i dont think it is. I was bedridden for several days afterwards tho and it still hurts all the time but the associated sciatica has gone"
OpiatesRecovery,flp1lib,t3_fq3lqw,1585349830.0,How did you herniate a disc and does it still give you pain?
OpiatesRecovery,fln8s9v,t1_fln3vn6,1585312629.0,"If i was you I would wait like 72-84 hours and jus use some benzos/gaba/sleep meds for the first 72, and then when you take a bit of sub you should be feeling so fucking bad that it would have to help, right? How long would you wait to take some sub the other times?"
StopSpeeding,flmwctr,t1_flmw24e,1585299442.0,"lol i don't like this because i feel like it's totally true. But heroin is easier for me to kick than the IV coke, that's what always gets me, but then I need to shoot heroin to come down so... yeah maybe not"
