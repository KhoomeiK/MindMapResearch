I've made a lot of stupid ones. Hurtful ones. Horrible ones that hurt people I care about. I dont want that anymore. It may be too late to repair all, and I think I'm naive to believe that's possible. I still try. I still think and hope and feel for others."

Dissociation,fl8eage,t1_fl8dsi7,1584921715.0,"Also, to be fair, I had ""dated"" someone before this in the midst of us being broken up. I say that in quotes because that person and I barely talked, were not in agreement about being in a relationship, and this person got involved in something that didn't involve them. Which I had explained multiple times and that this person I ""dated"" had continued to claim we were in a relationship after the week or two we supposedly did. I was not communicating with this person, nor ever met them in person. And with the most recent thing, all I knew was that I was being sexually assaulted even though this person says we slept together and had ""proof"". So idk."
Dissociation,fl8dsi7,t3_fn96rx,1584921395.0,"I've been doing research. About a month ago I had an issue where I was fully dissociating and in and out of splitting and being lucid. I had memory loss about sleeping with someone while in a dissociative state and when I came out of it, this person was still trying to touch me sexually and I found myself becoming traumatized because of it. I was a victim of abuse as a kid and had no recollection of us having sex. Failed to mention it to a new s/o and now she is understandably hurt and angry. We weren't together at the time. Still, understandably, she believes I'm lying when I seriously don't remember. I told her everything else in regards to this person and she thinks I purposefully left it out."

BPD,fji4u2s,t1_fji4a9k,1583360621.0,I can't accept that we are evil..there are always ways to be better. We can come off as evil at first but it's so much more complicated than just the surface.

DBT is great. It's been the most relatable concept in terms of therapy. I'm currently working on getting into treatment.
