Eventually when my health was suffering, my relationship was nearly ruined, I'd lost yet another job from being too hungover to go in and I *still* continued to drink until blackout, I realised that I'd lost control of it all and I hadn't got the ability to not drink anymore. And yet I continued. It's easy when you're drinking to think 'everything is okay, everything will be fine', then you wake up hungover, filled with self-loathing, sick, tired, with an angry, upset partner you briefly realise that it's not okay. Whether this makes you decide to make a change or not, who knows?
I'm very nearly a year sober, it's next week in fact. I went to my doctor, I asked for help, I went to AA, I made promises I initially couldn't keep, but I did it. I did it for my husband, my children, and for myself. The first stage was admitting to myself that I have a problem. Your dad has to do this very hard part himself, you can't do it for him. But if he can, just be there to help and listen. 

Good luck OP, it isn't easy being the loved one of an alcoholic. I had amazing support that helped me stop drinking and by writing this post, I can see you really want to help your dad. PM me with any questions.

MadeleineMccann,ffxeeqs,t1_ffvsa8s,1580323460.0,"This is a very concise, clear and plausible version of what I believed happened."
MadeleineMccann,ffxe8gj,t1_ffwzhvo,1580323356.0,"Really??? I'd say Kate is probably an absolute control freak. Everything about her demeanor after the event made it appear so. I have two daughters, one the same age as Madeline was when she went missing. I'd have been frantic, crying, literally begging to have her back or someone to own up if the same thing had happened to her, Kate appeared to be in shock, but little else (as she would be after what I suspect really happened on that holiday to their little daughter)."
