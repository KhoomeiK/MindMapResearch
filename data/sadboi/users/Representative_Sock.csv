bipolar2,f8xnnld,t3_e2stsk,1574925423.0,"Sorry to hear this is happening, it is very distressing. You're brave for reaching out during a situation that can feel very isolating.

My ex was very similar and I ended up narrowing our arguments to writing (I shouldn't have needed to). Through this, it became apparent how much he gaslighted, emotionally manipulated and abused me under the pretense of ""concern for my mental health"". I ended up breaking up with him to preserve my mental safety.

It seems your SO is exacerbating your bipolar by causing unnecessary stress. He's using humiliation, put downs and mind games to devalue you and your mental wellbeing. That is not okay. It is not healthy. That is abuse.

I'm sorry that you felt you needed to record your fights to convince yourself of your sanity. You shouldn't need to do that. That is indicative that your SO is disrespecting you through playing mind games, and making you doubt yourself; when he should be listening to you.

The fact that he refuses to listen to you is indicative that he will not change. The fact that he uses your mental illness against you is indicative that he does not value your mental wellbeing. That's not okay.

An important question to ask yourself is ""Do you feel mentally safe with him?"" If not, do you think your mental wellbeing would improve if you were no longer together? There is no shame in prioritising your safety.

I can only speak from experience, but leaving my ex was one of the healthiest decisions I have made. It has made it easier for me to manage my bipolar and lead a better life.

If you plan to break up, do you have a support network? Do you have somewhere you can go? What services in the area provide support for people leaving DV? 

I know it seems hard, confusing and utterly terrifying at the moment, but you will remember this as one of the more formative experiences of your life. You are brave, worthy of love, respect and people who care about your wellbeing, holistically."
bipolar2,f7xugud,t1_f7xtqdp,1574076011.0,"Definitely contact that side of the family! His dislike is indicative of the likelihood that they'll be supportive. I'm sorry your family is abusive as well. üíï I'm sorry you have been so isolated. You are not stupid and this is not your fault. There is a solution. 

Can you talk to your university about your situation? Can they advocate on your behalf? Other people have likely been in a similar position to you and needed that support. I know when I was at uni, I obtained a statutory declaration of my situation and they made some concessions.

You are not stupid for being in this situation. It's very common for DV survivors to end up in just as abusive relationships. That's what happened to  me. It is often an effect of unprocessed trauma. It is not your fault that he exploited you. He's violated your rights to feel safe, loved and respected.

If you need some temporary social support, I'm willing to help for emotional support. üíö

Also, I'm so proud of you for making a plan! You're taking care of yourself. If you want any resources on safety plans, I can definitely recommend some."
bipolar2,f7xsnek,t1_f7xnq4l,1574073375.0,"Seconded!

I'm sorry that you're experiencing this. It sounds awful. üíõ

It seems that you are experiencing domestic violence. I know everything seems stressful, but like @deepistdarkest wrote, be frank with your family. They're your support network. If you have friends nearby, try and reach out, if you feel comfortable doing so. They may be able to offer a safe space and support, even if it's temporary.

There may be community support services to help you leave DV.

I also recommend being frank with your hospital and workplace, if they seem receptive. There may be supports in place, like an Employee Assistance Programs, in the workplace. Maybe they can give you some time off to stay with your family and then return?

That written, your SO's behaviour is not your fault. It is unacceptable and though you may feel shame for this situation, it is not your fault.

What matters right now is your safety. Your safety is being threatened and he refuses to respect your right to feel safe. That is not okay.

I know leaving can feel terrifying. I've been there. Twice. It is doable and it is so hard. So hard. But I don't regret it at all. My bipolar and health is so much better because of it.

Every time I was scared that I didn't have enough money, that I just couldn't leave because of work, because of study, because I was away from family. Reaching out is what helped me get out. It can feel humiliating, shameful and like we're not resilient enough. But that vulnerability is our strength. You are not alone, even if it feels like it.

You have a right not to live in such a stressful, toxic environment. These are relationship rights.

If you need to, you can ring your family, pack a bag and leave. Also, remember that leaving is not a failure. You are not a failure.

It seems you care about your internship. I bet you worked very hard to secure it. If you have to leave your internship, you're not failing. You're not weak to prioritise your safety and well-being. 

Remember that you managed to get an internship. You can do it again because you worked hard for it. You are capable. There will be more opportunities.

Sorry for how long this is. If you ever want to talk, please feel free to DM me. üíï

Sending you strength and love."
bipolar2,f4op9hn,t3_dl59dv,1571705222.0,"I stopped taking my pill about three months ago because I'm terrible at taking it regularly and it lead to constant spotting. In December I'll be getting an IUD.

Last week my first heavy period arrived and it's propelled me into a mixed episode, which is absolutely mentally exhausting. 

I can barely concentrate on anything, am incredibly agitated; feel sublime yet am plagued by intense emotions of guilt and remorse. These sensations have made me remember every other instance I felt like this, which, unsurprisingly, was around my period, when I wasn't on contraception.

My coping strategies at the moment are being self-compassionate, sating my cravings, keeping a routine by attending/doing regular events/tasks, avoiding shopping and driving, maintaining regular hygiene habits, eating healthily, and maintaining a low stimuli events. It seems to be helping so far. Not as much as I'd like, but every bit matters."

bipolar2,f49phx4,t3_djuzcs,1571478612.0,"This has been a constant trend in my life. Usually when I get sick, it's to a greater extent than other people. Last July, my SO and I both caught the flu, but because I'm asthmatic, I got pneumonia as well. It was so awful. It took two months to fully recover.

Like others have said, stress is a significant factor. Persistent stress does weaken the immune system and make you more susceptible to illness. Stress also slows healing. 

I try to reduce stress as much as possible, which has improved my health a bit. Now it's just constant colds and less frequent sinus infections."
bipolar2,f3tn6ju,t3_di41g0,1571140550.0,"Had this two months ago and gave into the urge last month. Made sure it wasn't a big snip because regrets would be real.

bipolar2,f3ta9qq,t3_di34ud,1571124742.0,"Alarms. I set daily medication alarms. This helps me take my meds at the same time, everyday, and this, become routine. It's hard at first.

When I first started using alarms, I would reward myself with something I liked afterwards, e.g.. episode of The Office, putting money aside for a saving goal, etc. A positive reinforcement to reinforce this habit. I still do this on days when I just don't want to take my meds. Hope that helps!"
BipolarReddit,f3t9zbf,t1_f3sxll1,1571124354.0,"This is what I have done with my other disabilities. Then, if I need accommodations at work, I tell my employer and educate them simultaneously. Yes, it's not our responsibility to, but it helps ease the transition.

Resource wise, I've used SANE Australia. They have an entire section dedicated to how employers should treat and manage their employees' mental illnesses with tact, empathy and care."
BipolarReddit,f3t9dw7,t3_dhwqss,1571123585.0,"Well done you! It can be absolutely freeing when you're open about your diagnoses and how they don't diminish who you are. 

I haven't done a public post about my bipolar diagnosis yet. Still hesitant to ‚Äî most people I've told, who are exceptionally close to me, have been receptive and understanding. Some have even spoken about people they care about and their disorders. But further? Not yet. 
What type of responses did you receive, if I may ask?

As for your concern around potential rejection/hurt later on: those people are never worth your time. Think of what you shared as opening up your support network. If things do go south, you have people, who know you were receptive to you having bipolar and BPD, and who (hopefully) will be supportive.

Again, well done on your courage and candidness."
BipolarReddit,f3ss8d8,t1_f3rw3y3,1571108203.0,This is really helpful advice! Thank you for sharing. üòä
bipolar2,f3eh0dd,t3_dgnobi,1570876481.0,"That was my thoughts when my psych told me she suspected it about a month ago. Reading through information and experiences of people who have bipolar was like a mirror to my life. It was revelatory! It also made me realise, 'I can lead a somewhat normal life with proper treatment'. 

My psychiatrist formerly diagnosed me last Tuesday and started me on 50mg of Seroquel immediately. Already on 150mg of Effexor for PTSD, so we're focusing on stabilising my mood and without reducing my PTSD meds.

The psychiatrist also told me there's an increased correlated risk of developing bipolar if you experience domestic violence growing up."
relationship_advice,f3efs4y,t3_dgrj66,1570874486.0,"If it helps, my life was similar to yours at that age (28F). What helped me over the past two years has been attending open social events, either through MeetUp or FB. These had to be events where we were doing something (i.e. photography, crafting, etc.) because people bond more easily through shared experience. All of this helped me form friendships, over time, and improve my social skills (personally, I'm a super awkward dork, but getting better).

At the moment, I'm in an LDR with my partner for the foreseeable future; and picking up a hobby (where you can attend social events) has helped me heaps. Mine is reading and it means I can attend book events, and meet similar-minded people. I've made some great friends talking about books and we regularly bump into each other at book events now.

Another thing that has helped me is inviting people over to my house once we're friends. I'm quite a homebody; and I've found most people are happy to come over if you cook 'em a meal, have a chill night with films and TV. Again, there's shared experience and something to talk about.

That being said, I still get lonely without my partner here. I miss him so much! I'm planning to adopt a pet in the next few months to help with that. Maybe if you can get a pet where you live, that will help curb the loneliness a bit?

Friendships take time to form, so be kind to yourself. There's nothing defective about you. üíï If you want/need to talk, my inbox is always open.

All of this being said ‚Äî you mentioned you don't 'like' going out. Does the thought of going out/interacting with strangers cause you anxiety? Does it make you nervous? 
If so, it might be worth seeing a counsellor for social anxiety to develop some coping mechanisms. That was a significant part of why I felt so lonely in my mid-twenties.

Sending you much love and hugs!"

Asexual,f2zloaf,t1_f2z9q06,1570528944.0,"^^^This! 

It may also be helpful to talk about how it makes you feel. Maybe express that you value your friendship but sharing this personal information breached your trust, something integral to your friendship.

It may be worthwhile also asking why they breached your confidence. They may not understand the ramifications of this, as the @SirWigglesTheLesser detailed. Encourage your friend to read more about your sexuality, but remember you're not responsible for educating them about asexuality.

I'm sorry this happened to you, it really sucks."
BipolarReddit,f23doi1,t1_f23ct1j,1569918663.0,"Whoa, it's been a similar experience for me! My doctor prescribed me antidepressants and they were having an undesired effect. So, my psychologist made me complete some questionnaires and track my mood, which confirmed her suspicion that I might have bipolar. So, off to the psychiatrist I go!

How has it been with medication for you? How did the psychiatrist choose the most suitable meds, etc?

I have old journals from over the years, that clearly show sudden mood shifts. I even have records of my cyclic panic attacks and elevated moods (sometimes I wouldn't sleep for four days at least) from when I was fourteen. Would it be worth mentioning those?

Sorry, it's hard to condense fourteen years of undiagnosed symptoms into a concise summary."
