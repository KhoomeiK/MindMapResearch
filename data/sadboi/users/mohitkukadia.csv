IndiaSpeaks,fr3vp7r,t1_fr3tsj4,1589867593.0,">Lockdown should be restricted only to hotspots. If pan India lockdown is extended more people are going to die of hunger than covid.

But we are not are we, I live in Vadodara we have currently around 240 active cases and everyone is going outside like it's a normal day."
IndiaSpeaks,fr3vl52,t1_fr3t6ck,1589867501.0,"I know right, I am sorry but I am afraid to go outside. Because doesn't matter there is only going to be surge in cases."
india,fq5nke7,t1_fq5nflx,1589111958.0,Yea I know right it's not like the lives of a billion people is riding on them hoping that works out!
india,fq5n907,t1_fq5n3xq,1589111653.0,But no one knows the amount of time the virus stay active in our body. 7 days is very less. As I said there are cases where the people were asymptomatic for more than 20 days and they still were positive of COVID 19. If we can't get another test then how will we know if he is positive or not
india,fq5n1tp,t1_fq5moi7,1589111458.0,"If the tests were not accurate, then every country will also be doing this. This is the first time I have heard the term FALSE POSITIVE related to COVID 19.  The tests are very much accurate, I think. Do you have any reliable sources that tests are not accurate? We have anti-bodies test too (they are not very accurate)."
india,fq59voz,t1_fq59mjj,1589097449.0,"Let's hope they are not that stupid. But as Red says hope is a dangerous thing and I am inclined to believe him. Even if people knows, the information is still out who knows."
india,fq59eed,t1_fq594ek,1589096963.0,"As I said Gujarat (Where I live) has started it. Trust me everything starts in Gujarat first in this government. In WB it was cancelled there was severe backlash. 

 I know that's what I had hoped we will not fudge up the numbers, at the moment we are not fudging the number but they are delaying the inevitable. Delhi govt already is trying ( just google it) they said the miscalculated the death or something like that , WB already did it and is doing it probably, Now Gujarat and Idk what's next. Because if we start fudging the numbers, we are fucked."
india,fq58o9q,t1_fq58g4a,1589096235.0,But if they don't include the death of people with morbidity in the official data then people will think that the COVID-19 is nothing and it will give a false sense of hope. Eventually more people will break the lockdown and the cases will increase.
india,fq57x60,t1_fq57m63,1589095489.0,"So basically we are fucked. This is India, people don't follow the protocol after getting into the hospital (one of the patients from my city went outside after he was informed that he was positive). But also how long does the person needs to be in quarantine and how will we know that he has no longer has COVID 19 if we don't test them? Every person's body is different, some take a while some take a lot longer to fight. Where to go to determine whether or not the person is suffering to COVID 19?"
india,fq57ae4,t1_fq54bsh,1589094873.0,"Yes, you are right. But atleast they can announce COVID deaths in two categories then. First with comorbidity issues (Also should mention the specific disease)and second without it. Then it can give us a clear picture I guess."
india,fq54lyy,t3_gguav1,1589092351.0,"Yes, you are right. But atleast they can announce COVID deaths in two categories then. First with comorbidity issues (Also should mention the specific disease)and second without it. Then it can give us a clear picture I guess."
india,fq526zt,t1_fq50pkr,1589090221.0,"Exactly. Look if you have diabetes and if you die due to renal failure then only diabetes can be considered the cause of it. Because it was due to diabetes, there was renal failure. In the present case it is not due to other comorbidity issues that you have been getting Coronavirus. It is due to Coronavirus that your existing conditions have escalated."

india,fq4zjlj,t1_fq4zbu6,1589088100.0,"That doesn't mean you discarge them. You kept them under observation, some people have died after showing no symptoms for 20 days or something."
india,fq4zfrg,t1_fq4yofk,1589088021.0,"Happy cake day,
Exactly that's the worrisome part, We have started fudging up the reports. Here in Gujarat too, it will take 7 days after you have died from Coronavirus to be included in the official death list. They will check if he has prior health issues. But they have not disclosed any classification or anything. Due to Coronavirus, death is getting escalated even if you have prior disease. My father is diabetic and I am sure every family had one diabetic person, so does that qualify as prior health issue and if they get and die, they don't die due to Coronavirus? That's stupid, person's life span is reduced."
india,fq4z3oy,t1_fq4ym6a,1589087770.0,I am saying that people who have tested positive earlier are not getting tested after 10 days if they don't show any symptoms and they will be discharged.
india,fq4yyhy,t1_fq4ym0k,1589087664.0,"I think it's under reporting. If you read the article they are saying that two different manufacturers are producing around 2 lacs test per day and one is 30,000 test kit per week(I have no idea why). That means we have the material and the manufacturing capacity. But you should test the people who might have corona virus after they have tested positive. Because 80% India's patient are asymptomatic."
india,fq4yhvq,t1_fq4y598,1589087327.0,"So this means we have the capacity, we are not using it. In TN they increased the testing and number of cases increased significantly."
india,fq4wmsj,t1_fq4uz87,1589085975.0,"That doesn't mean that you will stop testing the people who are most likely to have Coronavirus, ones who have already tested positive. That is just stupid. This people can even be super spreader. I know you are being truthful but I am just so pissed."
india,fpumuof,t3_gfedkd,1588917215.0,"First of all I AM SORRY BUT WE ARE ALL HERE FOR YOU. Now the first step is tough ( I am law student in final year). We are very proud that you asked for help.  Now, please follow through it, because things will escalate for you, if it's stopped at this moment ( experienced here). Whatever I am saying is not any sort of legal advice but just based on my knowledge and experience. Most important don't say a word to your mother about any of these things. The victim in an abusive relationship are by now are usually comfortable in the situation, she will not like whatever action you take but it is the correct choice..

1st Step :- Record the abuse. Video record it, audio record it. How he's watching porn when you are in a room to when he threatens your mother. Evidence is necessary, it's vital. 

2nd Step :- Call the police at your home while your father is abusing your mother or just call them and complain them about the abuse , show them the video when they come.

Worry about the divorce later, first step for you is to be in a safe environment. 

Remember you are registering an FIR  not your mother because your mother will try to refute your dad's abuse but you need to hold your ground."

Coronavirus,fkub3hj,t1_fks1854,1584546005.0,"What they are trying to tell is that we can't test 1 billion people. That is complete foolish. No country is testing everyone. That will be just waste of time and money. Rather they would first take random sample from people suffering from symptoms of COVID-19 and then they will determine whether or not there is community transmission. They are prepared beds(more than 60,000) and ventilators. They have  quarantined all the people coming out from India. Why would they do all this if they just want to hide the real number. Rather they are preparing for what might come. We are equipped to deal with this or not we will only know in future. Rather they have done a good or terrible job, only the future can tell. But looking at current situation we are  doing an amazing job."
Coronavirus,fkrzwax,t3_fkd06t,1584479382.0,This information is incorrect and misleading. India has already started test to measure whether or not there is community transmission.

A simple Wikipedia search will do.
