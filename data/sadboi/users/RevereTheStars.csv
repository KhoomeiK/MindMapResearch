Though I wanted to see it, I was a bit hesitant to, as I had heard from others of how depressing it was.  I knew that taking such a risk could be disasterous for me, but I ended up taking the chance.

It was literally the one thing that provided me with comfort and enjoyment in my depression.  It became something like a piece of driftwood, seriously.  I can see why so many can relate to the film in different ways."

This morning I was having thoughts that my life is blessed, which was a stark change from the negative thoughts I've been having lately.  It felt soothing.

Do you have a bipolar meeting group in your area?  I started going to the Bipolar UK one in my area.  They hold it once a month.
I'm not even a group person, but I tell you, I'm so glad I found it.  I feel very comfortable there, and hearing other people's experiences of bipolar teaches me things about my own experience, or gives me a new perspective that I otherwise wouldn't have had."

I think browsing and interacting more on this sub would really help me, actually.  Perhaps I can also try to help others too.

I like how your talkdoc (wow, I love that title) says that it is ok that you are going through this right now.  There is real acceptance in that, rather than resistance.
I think the voluntary work at the cat shelter sounds fab.  That must be really rewarding!  I used to work 4 days in my family business, and now I'm not really working since I got very bad a couple years ago.  I recently started going in for 2 days, but it feels very alien.  I feel like a different person, and I guess I am.  I can't handle responsibility as well as I used to.

Also, what sort of things did you do in group therapy?  Was it talking therapy, or arts and crafts?  I'm genuinely curious.
I'm feeling alot better right now in this moment, but I can see that I may have to do this if things get bad.  I never know how I am going to be day to day at the moment.

I really hope you are doing okay, and I'm glad you made the decision to go into hospital, as it gave you the space you needed.  I think that life and society is not calibrated in a way that is conducive to a healthy mental state, and it's a shame to say the least."

I don't feel as angry about this today, which is a good thing.
I sent her a link late last night highlighting the various factors and causes of bipolar.  I was making a point by sending it.

I thought she would make some annoyed/passive aggressive reply, but she just said 'I do understand, sweetheart.  I do..  I love you xx'

I guess my anger and pride came from her acting like she knew it all, so I'm glad she replied in that way.  I couldn't stay as angry, at least."

Forgiveness is such an amazing and liberating thing.  It is just not a possibility for me right now where my mother is concerned.

I also think it's great that you are applying your experience to helping shape your future, and the future of your family.  I guess that's where healing can come in.

I may tell her tomorrow.

The thing is, even when the depression begins to lift, I'm never truly happy.  The fact that I have low self-esteem clouds everything, and makes the depression deeper somehow.  I wasn't always like this.  I've become a shadow of who I used to be.
Anyway, thank you again."

You are not, and I repeat, NOT weak, but infact, your post shows a great strength.

You have been going through this with little support - you are showing a readiness to receive help.  Reach your hand out.

Please understand that you are not alone - we are with you.
Talk to your therapist, let it out.  I have also been  having dangerous thoughts lately, and so I have made the decision to talk to my psych in tomorrow's appointment, continue seeing my new counsellor.

Can I ask, what gives you distraction at the moment?  For me, reading graphic novels has been helping alot lately, as well as watching youtube vids, browsing reddit.

My counsellor taught me a breathing technique, it may help you.  You breathe in for 4, hold for 7, release for 8.  4-7-8.  You can count as fast as you like.  It does help me when I am having intrusive thoughts and acts as a natural tranquiliser.

Reach your hand out for any help - can you call your psychiatrist?  I know you said you are currently not on meds, but having a chat about what you're going through is important.

I don't know where you are, but here in the UK we have the Samaritans helpline, and it's been a lifeline for me when things have been at their worst (and even when they haven't).  Take advantage of the help that you deserve.

We are here for you, please believe it.

Edit - I saw that you are thinking to go to the hospital Tuesday.  Please keep us posted on how you are doing, even day to day.

Also, I hope my points about distraction and the breathing technique didn't make things seem trivial.  I'm just saying little things that have helped me enough in the moment, or hour by hour."

The part where you said about wanting to see/feel a change within yourself, and about being in service to the universe, but also sometimes feeling like the universe has forgotten you - I could really connect with that, because I feel the same way.

I think it would be great if you could continue sharing videos as and when you feel to, because you never know who it might reach.

After so many times, I stopped feeling afraid when I began to wake up during it.  Instead, I observed it with a bit of detachment, with almost an experimental approach.

There would be a strong buzzing/constrictive sensation, and I found the intensity of it would great stronger if I weakened myself/yielded to it. Fighting the sensation would be the answer to getting it to stop.

Alot of the time, there would be sexual overtones, and it always felt like someone else was present and doing this.  From what I have read, these themes are very common within sleep paralysis.
