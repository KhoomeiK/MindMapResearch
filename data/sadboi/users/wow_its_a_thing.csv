if things get too intense remember copes: rubbing ice on the places you usually cut, using a red marker to draw lines, elastic bands, screaming into/hitting a pillow, being in nature, venting to yourself or a journal, ect.

I'm sorry for all of this.

I hope you find something to center yourself"
selfharm,fnoujt3,t3_g32kaf,1587133868.0,"I'm proud of you for not cutting ðŸ’—

For the question: risk wise it's possible you're giving yourself contusions depending on the bruise and impact. If the bruise and the surrounding area gets stiff and hard to move I'd recommend resting, as in sleep but also as in not using the muscles connected to the bruise, icing the bruise (soon after impact), compressing (even wrapping a shirt tightly around the leg ontop of the bruise) and elevating it. If the muscles have knotted, you can tell this by deadass feeling the bruise after some healing, you need to massage the knot out (be careful and remember that using a knotted muscle may cause damage). To massage a knot out, feel the shape of the knot and apply pressure while tracing the knot with your hand. It should be a bit of pain but not a lot. If pain lasts after you stop applying pressure you did it wrong.

sorry for this being so much"
