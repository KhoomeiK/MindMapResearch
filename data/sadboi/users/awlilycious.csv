SelfHate,fl3cn6g,t3_fmamxw,1584777728.0,"You know, we all have something we are insecure about. But we don’t have something WE SHOULD BE INSECURE ABOUT. We are made to be perfectly imperfect. You’re still young, you can better yourself okay?? If you hate your weight or the shape of your body, work out. Eat right and healthy. If you hate your height and posture, there are vitamins that can help you with that and braces. You can always do something about yourself okay?? Dont let it get to you. Still, be thankful for what you have. After all, not many of us were lucky enough to have complete body parts. Stay strong!!"
DeadBedrooms,fl0b6fb,t3_flfvvy,1584699711.0,When did sex became the fundamental of a relationship??? Oh righttt since the modern days of liberals 😩
DeadBedrooms,fkywyul,t3_flfvvy,1584657914.0,"Dudeee. You should really split up. It sounds like you’re threatening her of leaving if she wont have sex with you and thats mental abuse. Also, if you force her to do it without her consent it’s considered rape. Anyways I do understand that you need it and everyone’s done it but if you really love her, you’ll wait. Maybe she just wants to wait till marriage? Even so, just because everyone’s doing it doesn’t mean that YOU HAVE TO. ☺️"
