That's one reason I really liked the complex we chose- my partner doesn't have a car so it's nice to know if he has to walk to the grocery store or the laundromat for whatever reason, it's maybe half a mile away. The convenience is amazing and you honestly can't beat it for the price."

I was in the hospital a few weeks before this shit blew up in the US and I'm just thankful I wasn't in there any later.

The last thing I want to do is school or work but I'm one of few whose small business they work for is actually thriving right now. I love what I do but school is getting even worse.

I believe Victoria's Secret is owned by Sycamore as well (not 100% on that), yet they shut down their .com and stores already. Doing online sales only should be the only option just so we can get this virus done and over with. It'll help a lot because of Staples' clientele they attract LOL."
gmu,fkzu01s,t3_flgg4v,1584680320.0,"I miss GMU even though I was a hermit who barely left my dorm. I even miss my terrible suitemate who locked me out of the bathroom the whole time. 

I don't like having to move out and into my apartment in Woodbridge so early. I just want to live at Mason again. 

I was in the fucking hospital weeks before this shit happened. I missed a full week of classes and only had one week of class before the first week of spring break. 

I just feel like I missed out on so much and it's not fair. My last semester after 5 years of school and this is how it goes. 

I miss the robots, I miss my friends I saw in class all the time, I miss everybody I saw just walking around."
gmu,fkzru6x,t3_flkbm6,1584678529.0,I'm feeling the same way. I'm just really sad since I just started getting closer with a few friends and everything's gone to shit.
Staples,fkyux8d,t3_flhszu,1584656674.0,"I've noticed so many companies complied and closed, meanwhile you get dickheads like Staples corporate trying to say it's an ""essential store"". 

Target and Walmart are fucking essential stores. Nobody wants to buy office supplies from Staples anyways. 

I'm happy I work for a business that actually cares about my well being and I am happy that I support other businesses like Hot Topic and Aerie who care about their associates. 

I never felt cared about when I was at Staples. I tried to do what I could to help my co-workers but fuck management. Fuck Staples HR. They never did shit for me. 

I hope Staples gets shut down. They are not essential and they know it."

gmu,fkqluvu,t3_fjw12o,1584449829.0,"I'm just really sad because this is my last semester and I had just started to get closer to one of my friends. 

I've been struggling like hell with my sobriety and just trying to get fucking finished. Going home would be a death sentence and I live far away. I used college to get the hell away from my family and I don't want to be sent back there. I could barely string along being sober there at all. 

This shit only adds to my fucking stress. I want to see my friends and I'm so pissed I won't be able to. I have to move into my apartment early in Woodbridge because I'm sure Mason will be kicking us out of the dorms for real. Ugh fuck this shit. At least I get to be with my boyfriend right now."
gmu,fknypzb,t1_fkntign,1584376650.0,I called earlier today and they said they weren't even able to give extensions for the day let alone anything else.
gmu,fknyomm,t1_fknszru,1584376627.0,"True I'm just trying to prepare and I figure driving to stay with him for awhile we can figure it out and plan together. 

Worst case I have plenty saved for an extra month and my parents are willing to help if it comes to that. 

After I graduate I'll have enough money to live on and afford splitting the rent with him."
gmu,fknj0id,t1_fkmeszh,1584366941.0,It's bullshit honestly. I got an answer from housing after 20 minutes of being on hold and they said they couldn't offer anybody any sort of extensions by even an extra day or two.
gmu,fkml3iy,t3_fjchmr,1584331806.0,"I'm right there with you, I'm so pissed. Guess I won't be going to work at all the next 3 weeks and I have to go out of state to stay with my boyfriend (home isn't an option). 

I emailed them and I'll see someone if I have to before leaving to see if I can at least get access earlier. But yeah it's a nice ""fuck you"" email from Mason for sure."
Frugal,fjzgqzk,t1_fjzfk8i,1583719337.0,That sounds like a good idea! Thank you!
Frugal,fjzgq04,t1_fjz2asj,1583719318.0,"Hmm that's a very good idea, thank you!"
Anxiety,fjisphp,t1_fjib17w,1583374868.0,Thank you so much! :) I'm trying my best to be more positive! It's not easy that's for sure
