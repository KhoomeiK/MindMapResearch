""You still record it as a loan. It may not need to be repaid but it is deducted from your eventual EIDL loan amount. For example, you get the 10k now and in two months you receive a 90k net EIDL loan in the amount of 100k - Your repayment is 100k.

If you never get an EIDL loan then your upfront 10k is a tax-free gift but will assuredly have a tax line in the income section to account for it - income but non-taxable. But fo now, call it a loan. At tax time, if this, like any PPP loan, is forgiven you will clear out the loan balance to non-taxable income. Remember that any PPP loan funds get reduced by any $10k advance of EIDL, so they are interdependent"""
