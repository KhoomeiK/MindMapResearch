CPTSD,fcy2ssg,t1_fcxl6dm,1578074030.0,"For me I need my job. I freak out when I'm unemployed and am stressed to the maximum. I get stressed out at work when I'm not feeling secure in my job. 

I also need to feel accepted by those around me. If I'm worrying that they don't accept me I end up feeling so awful.

I don't think you should feel empty inside identifying the things you need to feel safe. Those are perfectly reasonable things to need."
