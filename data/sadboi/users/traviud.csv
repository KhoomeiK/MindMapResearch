Though everything feels like it's spinning out of control sometimes, we actually have fewer people in ICU around the world than we did a few weeks ago. This can be attributed to testing unearthing more mild cases, as well as increasingly targeted and appropriate treatments."
Anxiety,fpg67c3,t3_fj2y1a,1588595379.0,"The growth rate for new deaths hit 1% yesterday for the first time since February 26th.

God, remember February? It feels like a lifetime ago."

A reasonable possibility has been opened up, but a brief conversation isn't especially likely to have undone your efforts.

Believe me, I know how you feel. I was at the laundromat a month ago, banged my face against the card reader on a dryer and thought my life was over after weeks of isolation. As far as I know, I didn't contract anything that day.

It's unfortunate, but...please try not to catastrophize."

Anxiety,fpcjia0,t1_fpcg7y2,1588502878.0,"I appreciate your perspective. We in California ran into a similar wall two weeks ago; everything was chugging along quite nicely with dwindling cases until the we began knocking on nursing home doors and discovered the horrors on the other side. LA County is reporting that around 49% of our deaths come from nursing homes and assisted living facilities, but the number is almost certainly higher when considering the inconsistency with which we receive reports from them."
Anxiety,fpcfk58,t1_fpcedrf,1588498699.0,"I would love to include that information, but there is no resource I am aware of that differentiates between the testing of the general population and that of nursing homes and prisons. Nursing home data has been notoriously elusive, for reasons that this story can illuminate:

Anxiety,fpc0kk8,t1_fpbopkc,1588483847.0,"Same here in California. The lines are too long and the process is too slow now that we've enacted free testing for us to use up our materials. Apparently Los Angeles county is capable of churning out 50,000 tests a day, but we only do 10,000-20,000 on a good day. I'm not even sure if there's demand for 50,000 tests a day, but when the lines are a mile and a half long, perhaps."
Anxiety,fpbxg8x,t1_fpbu65e,1588481290.0,I do recommend everyone read the top comment chain because it's hilarious.
Anxiety,fpbx05z,t3_fj2y1a,1588480945.0,"For those of you who are concerned about the slowing of testing and alleged testing suppression in the US, this past week has been the US' most consistently prolific yet, at least in terms of reporting:

Average tests per day reported April 26-May 2: 231,385

Average tests per day reported April 4-25: 178,790

Additionally, our testing per million is now nearly 21,000, not far from Canada's 22,000 and above Hong Kong and Finland.

The shame of it is how long it took us to reach this point. Russia is far ahead of us with a very recent surge. We would be progressing far more quickly if there was more continuity and cooperation between the federal government and the states, but it's not like the numbers we've been bringing in are based on a lower number of tests than previous weeks. The opposite is true.

It would be great if there was a place that reported the number of tests conducted each day, but this is the best stat we have now for the country as a whole."

Anxiety,fpbt7ko,t1_fpbs1i0,1588478111.0,"People haven't been talking about it much, but it honestly does look like warmer weather has benefited the southern states in a meaningful way. Louisiana had a bad but short lived surge before dropping down to one of America's lower percentages of positive testing this past week. Florida hasn't exploded the way many expected. And yes, Texas seems quite well off.

Contrast this with the states getting hit the hardest: New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Illinois. The pattern is clear: if you have a high population density and you're experiencing cold weather, you'd best lock down for a while."

Anxiety,fpbmcpg,t3_fj2y1a,1588473354.0,"One of my favorite statistics for measuring the health of a country/state, how it's being impacted by COVID-19, and how they're responding to it is the percentage of positive tests coming in.

When a country is first testing for coronavirus, what inevitably happens is that the most infirm get tested first, resulting in the highest fatality rates and the highest percentages of positive tests. Over time, as the general population is tested more frequently, more mild cases and negative results show up in the data.

Here is the percentage of negative results in some countries that have been praised for how well they've handled the pandemic:

Australia: 1.1%  
South Korea: 1.7%  
Finland: 5.1%  
Germany 6.5%

Compare those figures to some countries that have been hammered by the virus:

Italy: 9.9%  
Spain: 16.1%  
UK: 16.1%  
USA: 16.7%

It's pretty clear that early, aggressive efforts to test and isolate reveal better results in the short term. Now, how are some individual states doing? The numbers may surprise you, and I'll tell you why folks in California should not be getting frustrated by the static figures we're seeing right now.

So, first off, let's talk about New York. Their current percentage of positive tests is terrible and the main reason why the USA's is so bad as a whole: **33.2%.** That's abysmal, one of the worst in the world. Every third person who gets tested there pulls up a positive result.

However, we've been told that New York is doing better. And they are, even if they're still not where they should be. They've conducted over 350,000 tests in the last 2 weeks, but only pulled in around 75,000 of their 319,000 positives. So their number has dropped to **21%** in that stretch. It's still bad, but clearly an improvement. They are trending nicely.

Now, let's do California. People were criticizing our testing early in the month, and rightfully so. Despite all our efforts to isolate, we still brought in positives **11.3%** of the time just two weeks ago. Not in New York's tier, but much further from South Korea's than we would like.

However, we've been reporting 20,000-30,000 tests a day for the past week, which is fantastic. Our new number? **7.6%** since the start of the pandemic and **6.4%** over the last two weeks, even lower than Germany's. Our number of positives has been only slightly above what we were seeing three weeks ago, but we're testing like crazy now. That's great news.

Finally, here are some states that you wouldn't think of as being highly impacted by the pandemic and their percentage of positive tests:

Utah: 4.2%  
Oregon: 4.3%  
Tennessee: 6.5%  
Washington: 8%

And some other states that are hotspots:

Louisiana: 16.9% (7.9% this week)  
Pennsylvania: 21.6% (19.4% this week)  
Massachusetts: 22.2% (18% this week)  
New Jersey: 47.5% (37.5% this week)

So I'll say this to all the protesters whining about not being able to go to the beach: chill out. Things are improving, even if you have to break out the calculator for a second to put a number to it. Crazy to me that California has a lower percentage of positive tests coming in than Washington, but that is a testament to how well we've handled this on the west coast. Ultimately, the goal should be limiting deaths and getting the numbers of positive tests down. Many states are trending down in the latter, even if things are changing very slowly regarding the former.

Source for the numbers was a mix of Worldometers and covidtracking.com."
