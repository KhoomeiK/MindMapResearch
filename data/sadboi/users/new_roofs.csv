fosterit,fezem8a,t3_equxgc,1579456544.0,"As a current foster kid. I don't think one should take in foster kids for instead of working, especially multiple of them without any experince. The money  is supposed to go to the foster youths (food,clothes, sports ect.) and the extra shared living expenses eg. higher water/electrial bill. If you by the end of the month have lot's of money over to spend on yourself, you're neglecting your fosters needs. They are humans not walkning cash cows.  Op should reconsider fostering or change their mindset."
