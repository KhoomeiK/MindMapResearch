I also can‚Äôt stand the gatekeeping here. Some people act like you need a bachelors degree to make lather lol."
wicked_edge,fqvf9ci,t1_fqveypk,1589676029.0,Sorry my apologies. I use the 6s and it‚Äôs beautiful for head shaving. I used to use the Merkur 23c and it couldn‚Äôt ever get the back of my head properly. The 6s just cuts through the back of my head so easily.
wicked_edge,fqvc4b9,t3_gl45b3,1589674136.0,I second a recommendation for chiseled face and A&E... those are good soaps
wicked_edge,fqvbzq3,t3_gl4cry,1589674060.0,I hear you. Shaving is my safe space
wicked_edge,fqvbrsy,t3_gl4mux,1589673929.0,You‚Äôre lucky!! The mail said I was going to get it on Thursday and it never came. I ordered a bunch of samples and a big ol tub of mountain man
