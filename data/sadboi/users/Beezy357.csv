legaladvice,fp0knk5,t1_fp0k49m,1588211181.0,"No offense taken,, I'm thankful for your responses... he is on the birth certificate. But if for instance there was any doubt that he was her biological dad, and the real dad came forward and took a paternity test then pseudo-dad would have no rights to her. Is that correct?  

This isn't the case but this is why I thought he would need to establish patsrnity before he could take her away, to avoid something like this from happening."
legaladvice,fp0jo9y,t1_fp0j0ws,1588210611.0,"When I said custody and paternity were never established,  I was referring to the courts. In my personal experience when I went to court for my own kids, even though I signed their birth certificates and they lived with me 50% of the time  I had to take a paternity test before the judge would move forward regarding custody. (I live in Indiana so it could be different from Illinois)"

SluttyConfessions,fd07mor,t1_fcyui2v,1578114841.0,"Exactly!  Girls have plenty of best friends that grow apart as they get older. I just met one of her best friends from college at a NYE party and there's a few more I haven't met yet and maybe never will. One of my closest friends moved across the country a year ago, my gf met him once when we first started dating but if I brought him over to the house I'll bet she wouldnt recognize him."
SluttyConfessions,fd06lkx,t1_fcy9f9h,1578114400.0,"The phrase ""best friend"" is used pretty loosely these days. So even though they were close in the past doesn't mean they still are. My gf has quite a few friends that I haven't met and vice versa. Part of the reason is we are from two different cities right outside of Chicago. The other reason is she doesn't really do social media, so it's hard to keep up with friends she doesn't see often."
