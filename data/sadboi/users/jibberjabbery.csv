Not necessarily a month of birth control but a few days of hormones like birth control. They put me on an IUD to lighten the uterine lining so it wouldn't get built up like it is now from not having a period. That was such a terrible experience. A copper IUD wouldn't fix the period problem.

BipolarReddit,fp7d1t3,t3_gbesha,1588368345.0,Lamictal helped some. It's the first med I tried. I was on it for about 5 years. It wasn't enough by itself and I needed other meds on top of it. At higher doses it can cause memory problems and in my experience it doesn't go away the longer you stay on it. The only way to help it is to lower the dose. The rash you can get from it is very rare so it's not something I would worry about. I think it's a good starting place.

Atarax/vistaril/hydroxyzine helped but I kept waking up during the night. Temazepam worked great but it's a benzo and I can't be on a benzo with ketamine, it makes the ketamine less effective.

I can't remember if this sub is why I started therapy but I think it played a role. Honestly I would probably be dead without this sub. It gave me the knowledge to go to a hospital when I needed to and the confidence that it would be ok. It makes me feel not so alone.

If you're not getting bad side effects keep going up on the dose to see if it does help. Once you hit 60 or 80 if it's still not working then I'd say you can really say it's not working."

I could do what I needed to but I couldn't cook and clean and do extra stuff. At 30mg I was at a 0 or +1. Huge difference. I cooked regularly, I cleaned, I did all of my work, I was great!

BipolarReddit,foojl1i,t1_foobnby,1587940245.0,"Well I was hospitalized for being suicidal which was due to the withdrawal. They changed my meds and prescribed things for the withdrawal effects like something for sleep. I had a very smart doctor who knew that seroquel and remeron both work on the A2 receptor and both meds have similar side effects (increased appetite, sedation) so it should have, in theory, been a solution. It helped immediately. Within a day or two the withdrawal was over and I could eat and sleep. Had I gone for zoloft withdrawal I really don't know what they would have done. Probably put me on an antipsychotic because I wasn't on one at the time. Every time I've been hospitalized I was on suicide watch."
BipolarReddit,foo9hk6,t3_g8lo38,1587935081.0,"Zoloft. Depressed and suicidal on it, depressed, suicidal, and nauseous coming off of it. I went on and off if for a week or two before enough was enough and I sucked it up and dealt with the withdrawal. It lasted a few weeks. Seroquel withdrawal was awful. That ended in a hospitalization where the only way I got off of it was to add something that acted similarly. Nauseous, insomnia, no appetite, depressed, I can't remember what else but I went to urgent care for it and they were no help. Eventually I was so suicidal a hospitalization was necessary. I should have been hospitalized after zoloft but I had never been before and nobody pushed me in that direction so I didn't see it as an option."
rtms,fonsf3m,t1_fcwal39,1587925550.0,Ketamine definitely helps. I'm about 20 sessions into TMS and I'm not doing any better so I'm thinking about quitting. After 3 or 4 ketamine infusions I was significantly better. It helps so much. Check out /r/theraputicketamine if you have questions or want to see people's experiences.

Not truly depressed but not where I could be. Right now I'm at a -2. Hard time showering, hard time brushing my teeth, hard time getting out of bed, don't feel happy, but also don't feel super depressed. It doesn't sound like you're at a 0. At a 0 you'd be able to do your homework earlier and you'd go outside and you'd want to help with the food. It sounds like you're at a negative something, but not that bad. Like a -2 or so."
BipolarReddit,folq9f5,t3_g7ospy,1587867940.0,Lamictal is another mood stabilizer that works well for many. Latuda works better than lamictal for me but it's technically an antipsychotic but it's approved for bipolar depression. I think I had lithium withdrawal though.
BipolarReddit,folpro3,t3_g84p67,1587867612.0,"Those meds are insane. Hydroxyzine did nothing for my anxiety, it just made me sleep. Trazodone does very little for my depression, it mostly makes me sleep. Neither of them are strong for psych issues. I was on both lamictal and lithium and still not stable so that doesn't strike me as too terribly odd but two atipsychotics on top of that? They don't like you on two antipsychotics at the same time period. Have you tried others? Seroquel is a strong med and could replace them. Or latuda, it's fantastic for bipolar depression and a high dose of latuda got me off of most of my other meds. Why antipsychotics on top of two mood stabilizers? That's telling me your mood stabilizers aren't working. 

There's a chance some of your drugs are working against each other and you'd be better off on less. I went from lamictal wellbutrin latuda and various fourths and fifths and even a sixth at times to latuda and remeron which I did better on than any of the other combos to now latuda and trazodone because I wasn't sleeping on the dose of remeron that helped and I may switch to latuda and seroquel. Your meds are a mess. I've tried almost 30 meds and I do far better on fewer. Latuda is a lifesaver. I was on 80 for the longest time and 120 was too much but finally someone thought to try 100 and wow. What a difference. I need a little something extra to be mostly stable but I'm so much better than I was when I was on 6 or 7 meds. Benzos are far better for anxiety than anything else I've tried. I have a prescription for ativan as needed. 

On 80mg latuda I had a lot of anxiety still. 100 took care of most of my generalized anxiety and I haven't been nearly as anxious since raising it. It's expensive but for me it's worth it.

Buspar could be something to try for anxiety. That's meant for anxiety way more than hydroxyzine is and it's not an antidepressant or benzo.

The therapist sounds bad. I would switch asap. You know what good therapy feels like so you really know when something is wrong. Wishing you luck finding someone new at a different practice."

Maybe more like you feel that way because you don't have distractions and nothing is going on and you're in a void? Things don't have a direction they're going in? You don't have a lot of things to look forward to? All guesses. But I could see her lumping those things in with the idea of being bored. I understand being frustrated with what she said. You didn't feel validated. She oversimplified your problem and you feel that it didn't get the attention it deserved. It comes down to validation. I would feel insulted too. I don't think what she said was out of line but I do think she could have put it in a much better way. It could have worked. It may have been more of a problem because it was over the phone and not in person or a video. Having the face to face feels way different than a phone call to me.

What helps my anxiety is a high dose of latuda. When we raised it I was anxious at first but haven't had severe or even moderate anxiety in months.

bipolar,fnfm8n9,t3_fqzelj,1586910854.0,I was on wellbutrin for like 4 or 5 years and I was fine. I wouldn't be on it without a mood stabilizer like lithium or lamictal though. That's asking for trouble.
antidepressants,fnflln9,t3_fsne89,1586910483.0,Wellbutrin can help the sexual side effects. It's an antidepressant. It can cause anxiety in some people though.
antidepressants,fnflbrf,t3_fue8pb,1586910322.0,That could be a panic attack. I've had panic attack symptoms just like that. It's more than just a lot of anxiety.
BipolarReddit,fnf1ogm,t1_fnexvnv,1586899779.0,I know. Wanting to clean in the middle of the night when I couldn't sleep made me a little worried. That was something that happened before I was diagnosed that made me know something was wrong. I think I'm ok. I'm not shopping and I don't have grandiose ideas. If I was crafting like crazy I'd be worried but I haven't crafted in a while. Anytime I was on 30mg remeron I couldn't sleep so I believe it's the meds. I haven't slept on my own since before seroquel a year and a half ago.
BipolarReddit,fnexv12,t1_fnexq0y,1586897854.0,Fortunately for now I only need to be up by 10 most days. I don't mind going to bed early to get all of the sleep I need.
BipolarReddit,fneww9v,t1_fnewl0u,1586897365.0,I took 50 but it was a year and a half ago and I don't really remember it. According to my post history it didn't keep me asleep and I woke up during the night a lot. Even high doses of seroquel didn't make me a zombie. I slept great on seroquel. I haven't had a drug make me oversleep too much yet so hopefully that won't happen.
BipolarReddit,fnewnq7,t1_fnerz6i,1586897243.0,I slept great on seroquel but it caused weight gain. If the trazodone doesn't work I'll probably ask to go back on seroquel and get meds for the high cholesterol it caused.
BipolarReddit,fnewjoy,t1_fnevovs,1586897184.0,"I get ketamine infusions and benzos make ketamine less effective. Temazepam helped but I don't want it to cancel out the ketamine. Atarax was apparently the only thing that wouldn't require changing my meds. I could sleep most nights on the atarax but I woke up during the night and it took a while to get back to sleep, plus it was taking 5+ hours to fall asleep so it wasn't the best fit. Last time I was on trazodone I woke up during the night but I was only on 50. Now I'll probably be on 150."
BipolarReddit,fnet8by,t1_fnedhyo,1586895439.0,I think I am. Currently bummed we're changing my meds again. My mood has been great but sleep is an issue. Super bummed.
BipolarReddit,fne2eiw,t1_fnd2bkd,1586881854.0,I simply could not fall asleep. I got a couple hours after 5. Good thing I see my pdoc today.
TherapeuticKetamine,fnd1fuq,t3_g0zdmc,1586854952.0,During my first set of 6 I want to say two of the infusions made me feel worse. Now I feel worse for a couple days after each one. It evens out and I end up fine. Don't stress over it too much. How you feel today doesn't necessarily determine how you feel tomorrow.
BipolarReddit,fncl6tb,t3_g0vnu0,1586839601.0,"I've messed with my meds before, probably more than I should have. I stayed on seroquel and latuda when they told me to quit them (separate occasions), I recently raised my remeron back up to what it was on due to side effects, but I'm sure they'll be fine with that. I just didn't ask. I've taken extra of sleep meds while staying within the max recommended dose. I've taken extra ativan on rare occasions. I've taken haldol as needed. My therapist said it comes down to not trusting my prescribers. I've also stopped meds against their advice when I got dangerous side effects. Like when I'm pretty sure I got lithium toxicity and they refused to do any blood tests. I think I just lowered the dose then. Or when zoloft made me dangerously suicidal. Some of the pdocs were awful. Some weren't terrible but didn't listen to me. Some were decent but left their position so I couldn't see them anymore. I've had like 8 pdocs. I like mine now but the appointment times are difficult so I may switch when the next school year starts. I don't know who I'll go to next."
TherapeuticKetamine,fn8mazw,t3_g052cm,1586744929.0,I still need meds even with ketamine. Ketamine is just a piece of my treatment.
Teachers,fn863mb,t3_fzzcbo,1586734699.0,"Our art teacher did a drawing video that she put on the school's parent Facebook page and she started it with saying that. She was even dressed as Carole Baskin. Everyone got a kick out of it. Not sure if the kids got it but I agree with others, if they do get it that's the parents' faults. It's so mainstream I don't see anything wrong with it."
BipolarReddit,fn4tgm0,t3_fzjztm,1586648604.0,I had awful side effects getting on it but they all went away. At higher doses I had major memory issues but lowering the dose helped. I was on it for about 4 years. It's an ok med but it wasn't enough for me and I needed a few more on top of it.
BipolarReddit,fn48p7b,t1_fn21tbg,1586636331.0,"Don't be scared. It wasn't that bad. Like I said, I'd be willing to try seroquel again. I'm considering going back on it actually. The reasons I'm not jumping for it are that I'm finally losing weight and I gained a bit of weight on seroquel. Not a ton. Maybe 5-10 lbs. But I weigh more than I want to so any weight gain would be a negative."
BipolarReddit,fn21pa9,t3_fyo9sn,1586575533.0,It was harder to wake up on XR and it took longer to fall asleep than on regular seroquel. I didn't notice much of a difference but I preferred regular seroquel due to the sleep timing. Overall I liked it. It made me super hungry. I snacked on dry cereal a lot. The sleep was great but mornings were difficult. I was late to work a lot which is really bad for a teacher. If I had to go back on seroquel I would.
BipolarReddit,fn1tuuw,t1_fn0ilx1,1586569975.0,"That's when I got the IUD. I asked out of curiosity. I only saw my gyn twice, once for my last pap smear and once for the IUD insertion. I needed it out asap so I went to planned parenthood to get it out because they could see me the fastest. I'm not saying I do need to be on the pill, but taking it for a few days could still really mess things up."
BipolarReddit,fn0fznu,t1_fn06ut9,1586541242.0,I asked at my last appointment what to do if I didn't get my period and they said hormones for a few days to trigger one. Basically a couple days of birth control pills. My exam was normal. They didn't have a reason why they're irregular but said I needed birth control to thin the lining of my uterus so it doesn't build up because it could lead to uterine cancer.
BipolarReddit,fn04vwj,t1_fmz9m1i,1586535503.0,"That's my fear about the shot, an irreversible year long hell. I react badly to so many medications that I fear anything that lasts more than a couple days. Something that lasts a year us terrifying. I'm sorry all of that happened to you."
BipolarReddit,fn04mfs,t1_fmyysm5,1586535363.0,I rarely have sex so I'm not worried about pregnancy. My instability on mirena was out of control. Not worth it for me. It came down to my life hanging in the balance. Never again.
BipolarReddit,fn04fln,t1_fmzs5za,1586535262.0,"Hormone free would be a copper IUD but I'm not interested in that. I don't care about the birth control part, I care about regulating periods and moods."
BipolarReddit,fmyxmb0,t1_fmyo7x4,1586498983.0,I'm so worried about any hormones after mirena was so bad.
BipolarReddit,fmyxkg6,t1_fmynuaf,1586498934.0,I rarely have sex so I'm not worried about the pregnancy protection part. I'm worried about the hormone swings and regulating periods.
BipolarReddit,fmynuys,t1_fmyio61,1586490795.0,"Check out the app calm harm for distractions. It's all coping skills and honestly pretty entertaining and always help me feel better and smile. It's free. Even if you just end up with 5 good minutes, that's 5 more good minutes than you would have had otherwise.

My therapist called me again today to check on me. I tell her I'm fine but honestly I'm somewhat depressed. It could be the TMS. It could be the changing remeron dose. It's probably both. There's only one person I've been honest with and they actually responded to me today and said helpful things! She's pushing me to make a routine and play sudoku and puzzles and stuff like that on my ipad. I can put together a puzzle on my ipad. I can play sudoku. These are things I can do."
BipolarReddit,fmyh5dk,t3_eoepy9,1586486060.0,I know I'm very late to comment but mirena made me crazy. I ended up hospitalized. I was self harming and very close to killing myself. It was definitely the mirena that caused it. Be careful.
BipolarReddit,fmyh0cv,t3_fq30lh,1586485965.0,I see some people saying they liked mirena but it was awful for me. I ended up hospitalized. They said the mirena wouldn't affect my mood but it most certainly did. Now I'm on month 5 without a period after getting it removed. When I do get a period it does make me more depressed and suicidal. The hormones in my system made me 10000x worse. I was self harming and so close to killing myself.
BipolarReddit,fmygosz,t3_fy5vf0,1586485742.0,"I noticed some difference at 40, a bigger difference at 60, and an even bigger difference at 80. 120 was too much for me. I'm currently on 100 and loving it."
