Camp on the very top of the boat in the one room with the one window. Use the rocket launcher most of the time. When you run out of rocket launcher ammo, use 1 clip of the thunder gun, then fling over to the lighthouse to try and train for a max ammo. (If I used all the ammo in both guns I just popped a max ammo elixir). If you just wanted to use classic elixirs you can cycle out bandolier bandit with secret sauce and that gives you two clips in each gun. I also used my rags everytime I could. (It took~ 9 shots with the rocket launcher to save up so I got 4ish rag used per max ammo)."
