RBI,f1slvyh,t1_f1sfhxe,1569730706.0,"I got photos of the red-head assistant talking to my neighbor, photos of my supervisors car on my street, drug tests, pictures of the data, photos of my old phone, 3 videos, the cell phone that was used to call 911 5 times because i wasnt feeling well bur the fire dept showed up (turns out meth & methadone were in my system).

The edited video & the original video. I have a screenshot of my computer screen which shows that the video editor app was downloaded at 12:51 on 9/4 and the video was edited tgat sane day. Not ny me cuz I was asleep. Also, i wouldnt want that video edited."

AskNetsec,f1rsyyq,t1_f1rpbn2,1569719779.0,I want to. They also happen to be my old employer so what will they say when possible new employers call for reference?
AskNetsec,f1rozrr,t1_f1rch79,1569718326.0," if you believe you're the victim of hacking call your local law enforcement, and possibly retain an attorney.

Ive been trying to, but its difficult when the ppl responsible for the hacking are so much more richer & have access to your number whenever you change it."
Whistleblowers,f1qu1t9,t1_f0xmx5n,1569706540.0,How do I protect myself against an SS7 attack?
AskNetsec,f0n5lsu,t1_f0n0ovo,1568761151.0,"Thank you for the advice! I'll address some of yourpoints:

1. ""I'm willing to bet your Google account and Facebook account share the same password.""

Nope! Different passwords. Changed my PWs SEVERAL times.

2. I'm willing to bet your phone's contacts are synced to said Google Account.

NOPE! I intentionally don't sync my contacts.

3.  willing to bet your phone's encryption is unrelated to either of the two things above.

Maybe. But my cell phone keeps getting encrypted after resetting the data to factory settings 8 times. 

""Change your passwords, use unique passwords.""

I do. I use: capital, lower case, numbers, characters, and NEVER English words. ALWAYS FOREIGN WORDS. 

Still getting hacked. I'm all for looking at things rationally, but we also need to take ALL evidence into act."

SuicideWatch,f0mbdg0,t1_f0lxd1d,1568741122.0,Finding peace and justice is especially difficult when you're going up against an individual who is rich & in a position of power. I've been turned away by more than 10 attys.

SuicideWatch,f0lbent,t1_f0knpeb,1568708525.0,"Unfortunately, it's not like that for me. The current  moment is so shitty. I used to work for an individual w/ lots of power & money. They blocked my bank 1 day, they stopped an ambulance from going to my residence, they had other individuals put drugs in my food, they paid my sister to spy on me via all my cell phone, personal acts. Before that they allowed employees in their office hack into my cell phone, personal accounts. Just a whole invasion of privacy I didn't know existed. They have blocked me from being able to contact a lot of ppl and any lawyers. Also, they know ppl in law enforcement so the PD isn't  gonna do shit. I've tried applying for jobs but I always get turned away AND this is after I left the county where I was working. They've stripped me of any personal connection I had, they're telling ppl to hack into my cell and say that I was part of a drug crew. 

My own family was willing to accept money to make sure nothing hurt them. 

I'M OVER THIS LIFE. I DON'T WANNA LIVE. I JUST WANNA CLOSE MY EYES AND NOT WAKE UP."
