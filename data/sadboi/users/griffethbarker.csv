My alternative is to just buy the 2700X, I suppose, but I hate to go back that far, plus the power draw is nearly double, and the price seems to be about $10 more expensive for a gen older CPU."

BlackPeopleTwitter,fmy3brt,t3_fxz0yh,1586477226.0,"Isn't the deal two or more items for $5.99 \*\*each\*\*? So say you get 2 items. That's $11.98. Now  you have the delivery fee. Say that is $3.50, so now you're at $15.48. Now add tax on the two prepared food items (but not the delivery fee, since many states including mine, delivery is not a taxable service). We will use US-NV's tax rate as an example (7.1%, which would be $0.85 or so)--now you are at $16.33. So that ''$5.99'' actually makes a better amount of sense than some people realize. After gratuity if you should choose to offer one, that can easily become $20-25.  

Another thing to remember is that most of those deals have restrictions and such, so if you add on toppings or the like, the deal can be void and you'll pay full price. So if you're deal shopping, stick to the deal.  

And, if you want to save $3-6, then do carryout instead of delivery."

hotels,fmt1ctb,t3_fwoce8,1586365289.0,"You'd need to know four things here, minimum, but there is a lot more to it than just these...  
* Market;  
* Type/Class;  
* ADR;  
* Occupancy.  

Last property I helped run was a 170ish room, 2 star property in a rural market saturated with a lot of hotels. ADR was super low due to poor top-level management of the corporate management company. Cost to rent a room was around $22. Average occupancy was 25-35% in the winter months and 70-100% in the summer months.  
  
Now I could take this information plus a bunch of other information regarding the financial state of the hotel and work a bunch of numbers to come up with the EBITDA and other statistics and compare to operating and capital expenses to determine profitability ans the threshold, but I no longer work for that company so I don't have access to that information.  
  
My point is that there's a lot more at play to answer that kind of question than many would think, and that it is highly specific to each property."

Our team plays comp for the teamwork, communication, and because that's how we find the game to be most fun. We've decided the number is just a number. That's just our mentality.
