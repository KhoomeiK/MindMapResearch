But with being aromantic, especially an oriented aroace like me, it's much more problematic to have people realize you value love just as much as them, and would love intense relationships, or even a QPP. There's also the problem of not reciprocating romantic attraction so it must be more disheartening to allos."

I think it's best to make the person just clearly not experience romantic attraction, and have an aversion to such relationships or advances.
