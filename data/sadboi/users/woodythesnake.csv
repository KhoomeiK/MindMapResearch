ptsd,fiu9kxa,t1_fiu16o5,1582737460.0,"Talk to your therapist about it. Mine is the one who oriented me to specialists and people who knew how to deal with it. Just bring it up, say what you said in that post. It’s not easy to talk about but it’ll help."
EMDR,fittkr9,t1_fitsvcm,1582729109.0,Sounds like a good plan 👍I’m working right after but I took the next day off. Self care is vital for it.

selfharm,fitimk3,t1_fitif76,1582721210.0,"It is so hard to talk about for the first time! I was so embarrassed and nervous and I was so afraid she’d ship me off to an hospital (which I really didn’t want) but she gave me psychologist (and much later psychiatrist) recommandations instead :) 

But it does feel good to have someone recognize that you’re suffering. I think so at least."
selfharm,fiti3c1,t1_fithvzb,1582720745.0,"No problem, I’ve been there, I know how tough it is. But you can do it! 😊"
ptsd,fithoaf,t1_fithcus,1582720371.0,Same. It’s so hard for me not to recontact them. I just feel like it must be my fault for being a shitty person but also I know that’s the mental illness talking.
selfharm,fithk22,t3_f9sebs,1582720264.0,"My psychologist has done mainly two things :

1. Try to understand why I cut to solve the root of the problem. This includes some questions that can be disturbing like what do you feel when you cut, do you like the pain, stuff like that.

2. Try to find alternatives. For me it was getting a punching ball and getting back into martial arts. Also finding a good way to stop (cause at some point I started wanting to stop even if I really didn’t at first). The way I chose included setting myself a goal and pushing it back every time I relapsed. 

However every psychologist is different and you don’t know if yours will work well with you right away. My current psychologist is my third one but I’ve been with her for more than a year now and she has helped me tremendously.

Good luck! I’m rooting for you :)"
zoloft,fith4w8,t3_f9r0dm,1582719866.0,You can do it but generally it makes alcohol stronger. For me I get drunk much quicker so take it slow and try to see how it affects you.
ptsd,fitgug2,t3_f99uli,1582719588.0,I can only ever sleep when I’m on the phone with my boyfriend. If that doesn’t work for you I’ve also tried melatonin (meh) and weed (good shit if you’re into that).
ptsd,fitgnm6,t3_f9d1g0,1582719405.0,"I’m on Zoloft, it has been making me have really weird and crazy dreams, no lucid ones though but I’ve had significantly more PTSD related nightmare. Imo and experience it is related to your subconscious. My ptsd dreams always are more intense when I get triggered.

IVe been on zoloft for a few months now and I still get odd dreams. SSRIs have weird ass side effects so you never really know what they’ll do to you. You should weigh the pros and cons. Just know that most side effects of SSRIs disappear after a while."
ptsd,fitgfxi,t3_f9irmo,1582719196.0,I’m in France and I got accommodations! Just need some papers filled showing you do have ptsd and it is indeed a struggle for you to function 100% in uni.
ptsd,fitgce3,t3_f9jwyp,1582719100.0,"It’s very common in people with trauma to feel like their suffering is somehow lesser than other people’s. That was one of my major issues going to therapy and I kept thinking I was faking it and wasting peoples time.

You need to accept that your trauma really was bad and that you do need to heal from it. It hurt you and that’s all that matters. I’d happily share my therapist with you my dude, you’re not taking therapy away from anyone, you’re walking the same path as all of us, trying to get better.

We’re all in this together!

Also I know the struggle, I’m at my third therapist right now, old one couldn’t remember my name right that’s how bad she was."
ptsd,fitg0f6,t3_f9os9x,1582718773.0,"You’re going to need professional help. I know it can be hard to reach out but it’s really the best thing to do.

So some advice :

- Get diagnosed. It can help you speed stuff up. I don’t know how you do it in your country so look up if your GP can do it or if you need a therapist or a psychiatrist to do it for you.

- Go to therapy. That’s extremely important. You’re going to need to work on it if you want to get better and you’ll need therapy.

- Look into trauma specific therapies especially EMDR therapy. It’s one of the most effective ones.

I tried to solve my PTSD alone for years and it came back to bite me in the ass really fucking hard later. I can give you advice on how to handle it on your own, pm me if you need them. I would recommend getting professional help tho."
ptsd,fitfmdh,t3_f9p769,1582718374.0,"I completely relate to you and I used to have this problem all the time. I couldn’t hug, hold hands and certainly not kiss a guy. I used to think I should just give up on love because of how fucked up my PTSD made me.

However, this changed in September. One of my long time friends became my boyfriend and he’s been so accepting of me it’s crazy. I’ve had flashbacks before, during, after sex. I have days when I can’t touch him at all. I even have episodes where I forget who he is. He takes it all.

I promise you that someone is really out there for all of us. People who understand and who care. So don’t give up. It’s going to be hard as fuck, I struggle a lot even with my boyfriend, but you’ll get there.

I’m rooting for you! I’m here if you need to talk about anything 👍👍"
ptsd,fitfdhm,t3_f9pp1z,1582718114.0,"You should look into EMDR. That’s the one I’m doing so far, I just started so I haven’t seen a lot of effects yet but I’ve heard it’s one of the most effective methods. No other kind or therapies ever worked for me before."

EMDR,fhaouq5,t1_fh85hb3,1581421398.0,"A safe place as in the place the practitioner makes you picture in your mind? I do. Only problem is it’s my boyfriend and we’re currently very (very very) long distance. 😭

I do have a pretty solid support system though so that’s been helping a lot!"
EMDR,fhaor3p,t1_fh8sohh,1581421238.0,"It’s mostly a country thing I think. Where I live (France) it’s usual for EMDR to last this long. I’m also lucky to have it be done by a psychiatrist which means I don’t have to pay for it but it also means that it’s harder to get an appointment, that’s why it takes so long between them.

Edit : Also I’m interested about those pseudo seizures you talk about cause I might be getting those as well (still need to do some tests to be sure). Any way I could PM you so we could talk about that?"
selfharm,f3ehert,t1_f3ayxv3,1570877108.0,"Thanks for the support dude. The end of the week has been hard kinda and the urges to relapse are strong but all of the support helps a lot  🙂
