depression,f7nc9do,t3_dx2la6,1573895067.0,"Ouch fuck, yeah, me too. I’ve fallen in more ways than one over the past one or two years. My attention and memory are shot, my mind just works SLOWER, and I’ve internally described it as a *haze* many times before. Add to all of that an extreme lack of motivation for daily life, and goodbye functionality.

The worst is, of course, that feeling bad about worsened capabilities leads to me falling deeper into the pit of “lay in bed all day avoiding literally everything”, which over time only decreases capabilities, and thus goes on the cycle."

depression,f529yp0,t3_dmifji,1571948557.0,"Cats are my comfort. 1) yes I fricking love them they’re like, the best in general, and more specifically 2) I’ve noticed that growing up with a single parent who doesn’t hug and subsequently being a bit touch-starved and socially isolated, it can feel ridiculously comforting to hold a cat, or to have one by me and pet it. It’s the physical comfort and connection I can’t get with people, along with the various beauty/silliness/kickassery cats bring on a regular basis."
depression,f52818e,t3_dmebsj,1571948056.0,"I feel the same. I’m sorry to my family that they’re stuck with me, I’m sorry to my friends that I’m a part of their lives, and I’m sorry to the myriad of acquaintances or strangers whose worlds I pass through, and in doing so, take up space in. But I am forgiven. We all exist, we all pass. Though my mind often rejects the understanding of that possibility, it remains there nonetheless. You are forgiven."
