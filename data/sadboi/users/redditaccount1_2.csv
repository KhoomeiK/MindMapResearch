ldssexuality,fpi3e0g,t3_gdl0o8,1588632873.0,"I have a higher sex drive than my husband too. The #1 key is to keep open communication. Talk about how you are feeling to him. Tell him it's a way that you feel loved. It is really frustrating at times but try and remember that you love him. 

Exercise increases sex drive. You could ask to get his testosterone tested but be prepared for it to come back normal. Scheduled sex can work great. Ask if he isn't wanting to have sex if he is willing to help you orgasm without it. 

The real answer is probably just that our sex drives go up and down. Sometimes there is an underlying cause and sometimes it's just because life is crazy or we are really stressed out.

I also want to always keep sex an open topic at home and let them know that no matter what mistakes they make they are still good, lovable, and worthy.
