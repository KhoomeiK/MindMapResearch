I don't know if it was my skill or that of the buddy, but yeah.

It felt a little hollow because I didn't get to really learn the fight and beat it alone, which is something I really like to do.

The stress is scary to me, but they're my favorite games of all time so it's weird.

Note that summoning is something I hardly ever do, and I beat pretty much everything on my own. Plus Now I kind of avoid summoning, and I hope to beat Midir on my own some time."

I have been emotionally abused in my religion all my life, and am only now learning of the many horrible things religious institutions are constantly guilty of.

I did believe in heaven, which was comforting in some ways but in others it was hell. It took a while to come to terms with atheist death, but I did it.

I could not imagine being religious ever again after the pain, mental conditioning and restraints I've been given. Be proud you're immune to the trap religious leaders have devised for you.

Know that I don't believe all religions or religious people are evil, but that many have a tendency towards harmfulness.

Video games can tell important stories, provide cathartic fictional environments, express emotions, teach us about each other, or generally be entertaining. The list goes on. It pretty much comes down to what you play.

I am also passionate about video games. The stories, characters, memories and joy they have brought into my life are things I cherish. I'd definitely put games right next to the other hobbies I love. (Reading, drawing, music, learning etc.)
