I won't try change your mind in regards to suicide but if you haven't seen a therapist before then i highly recommend it. I was feeling suicidal and it was my work that actually paid for my therapist and councillor. Im in a much better place now. It helps to talk. Ps people do care and you are valued and you're not alone
