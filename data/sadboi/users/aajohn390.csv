Herpes,f63uv2h,t3_dqfjs8,1572683831.0,"I know your frustrated but I just want to put this out there as someone who is dating someone who is gHSV1 positive there are well educated people out there who will not define you by your status and will date you despite it. When I started dating my partner and he told me he was a nervous wreck, but honestly it didn’t phase me because it’s not the first time someone has disclosed to me before. I had a previous partner get tested after we were sexually active and blame me for giving them HSV - so I went and got tested and was negative. It made me so mad that I got my revenge by educating myself lol. What most people don’t understand is that you’ve got a better chance of contraction of this virus through casual sex with a random person than to have protected with someone who knows they’re positive. Knowledge is power. I wish everyone has all the facts but the stigma is only a reflection of society’s refusal for self accountability. Stay strong - this doesn’t define you."

ptsd,et8cx55,t3_ca8lrk,1562553011.0,"1000 times relate to this. After my traumatic incident I switched jobs to something fun and easy, I moved in with my Grandmother (who is the ultimate healing force), I used all my extra time to express myself through art and I lost many many friends. It’s been about a year and I’m just now feeling together enough to date and move back out. But now I give myself space when I need it. If I start having panic attacks I listen instead of blaming and shaming myself. It’s my body’s way of letting me know it needs my attention. Who cares what the rest of the world is doing, focus on you. Most people never do it and never heal."
