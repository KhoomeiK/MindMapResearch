IAmA,fima04o,t1_fiirsks,1582522623.0,"Wizarding World is pretty laid back with that because you're dealing with people who may be asking questions about other things around the park or directions. If they dont understand the charm we add to the experience to the Wizarding World they may get frustrated so we break character and answer anything they need help with instead of ""not fully understanding"" the outside world.

In Walking Dead you pretty much never have to break it unless emergencies happen like the one I explained in the comment someone asked what was my scariest story. Generally they filter through easily enough to not ask questions.

And if we do break character and our supervisors see it they will ask us why but usually we have an understanding excuse. If we do it without any excuse and do it because you just didnt feel like being helpful today then they might have a talk with you."
IAmA,ffufjkm,t1_fftb76l,1580240887.0,Yes there actually is a protocol in which we can take. My manager wasnt happy that I forgot it but things got so crazy I didn't think about it at the time since I was a little new. I was disappointed I forgot it as well.. Needless to say I learned my lesson there and was able to prepare better for these situations which happen more frequently than people think.

IAmA,fft6tc0,t1_fft1vm6,1580210063.0,"We arent allowed to take any part of our costume home. Especially in the Wizarding World. When going to Universal you may see someone from any ride walking around the park but clearly in uniform for that ride that they aren't even near... but JK Rowling has her hands on everything and she refuses to let the Wizard, Witches and Students from Hogwarts leave the Village or Castle grounds.

Even though this forces you to show up an hour or two early to get into costume from your actual shift starting, I completely understand. As for the Walkers, its the same thing. When its not Horror Nights they just let you wear a mask that fits your face so you dont have to be getting in and out of make up. During Horror Nights its required though

Lol almost forgot to answer your other question! You get breaks every 30 minutes. Youll be on stage for 30 then get taken away for 10 minutes then pop up in a new spot for another 30. Its called Rotation. Same thing with Wizarding World. You're not standing in one place all day and it helps keeps things interesting!"

Im not actually sure there is a age in the lore for when is considered too old.. but i do know anyone can get a wand at the wizarding world! No matter the age! I've seen an older woman probably in her 80s get chosen before!"
IAmA,fft3acg,t1_ffs8w3u,1580204781.0,"Ive only done Horror Nights one year and it was incredible. I stayed at the Walking Dead but the hard part was doing that all day then taking a 3 hour break then getting right back into it for a few more hours of the night. It nevee got old but definitely tiring. After that Ive only been on call for Walking Dead during Horror Nights and working fully at Wand Host so I have a little more change if scenery once in a while.

One thing thats always fun and always volunteer for is during Horror Nights they have a few Walkers outside chained to a fence you can take pictures with. Thats been really fun to do 

Probably the best time of year is August to October because people are getting ready to be scared. During Christmas people bring more kids for the Grinchmas so you tend to get less people coming through the maze. But either way its very fulfilling!"
IAmA,ffrrj7p,t1_ffqsevf,1580164225.0,"Thats an interesting question! I'm never transitioning half way through the day which is nice so when I wake up I can really get in that mind set while on my way to work. There has been times where Ive been a Wand Host and see multiple opportunities to scare kids or maybe have that one family who likes to walk all over you and you just wanna jump in and scare em! As for vise versa, usually im exhausted after a full day at Walking Dead since I put so much energy into it so Im usually ready to jump into the Wand Host position quickly and take a physical break!"
IAmA,ffrquen,t1_ffqvclq,1580163790.0,"No one had every hit me but I had teenagers pull on my robes and costume while im either trying to reach for them or walking away. Luckily in places we hide out and wait for people they have buttons we can press and walkie talkies for emergencies and we can pin someone for it. Most likely they will be greated at the exit with security giving them either a harsh warning or a private escort out of the park.

I had this one lady very upset at me that I reached out for her son and told him to push me away but he didnt. Probably cause he was too scared. His mom told me to leave them alone and if I scare him one more time she'll knock my teeth in...... so i reported her. Luckily she took the warning seriously but did try to explain that if WE are allowed to touch HER then SHE should be allowed to touch ME. I don't think she understood how this stuff works haha"
IAmA,ffrqexn,t1_ffrm0s7,1580163516.0,"The Wand Keeper chooses randomly. If there is a kid and or adult in the room that is DECKED out in harry potter stuff or just seems WAAAY too excited to be there right now, they will pick them. But if everyone is kind of blending and there isnt someone like that they choose randomly. They dont always pick kids thought which is a common misconception."
IAmA,ffqj8j3,t1_ffqieoq,1580136110.0,"Working as a Wand Host you also get to be inside Ollivanders while people are being chosen for their wands. My favorite times are when children get picked and are able to work closely with the Wand Keeper. The best part, that admittedly I sometimes tear up watching, is when they have found Their Wand and the lights turn on and the wind blows all around them just like when Harry Potter got his wand... the face they make and the joy they feel never fails to make me smile.

The cutest one is when we got a very talkative child who was so energetic and very funny. When he got His Wand he lifted his wand in the air and yelled ""I'M A WIZAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARD!!!!!!!!!"" at the top of his lungs. I couldn't stop laughing and everyone got a kick out of it, especially the Wand Keeper."

The awful part is we can't do that to children or they might get the wrong idea so sometimes you'll be helping a kid with a spell and they'll run up to you saying ""I'M A DEATH EATER!! AVADA KEDAVRA!!"" We just tell them their wand is not strong enough to cast such a difficult spell and they are quite too young to be of His Army. Then we either try to change the subject or just... walk away XD"

IAmA,ffqicer,t1_ffqfx1t,1580135413.0,"As a Wand Host your job is to roam around the Village of Hogsmead and help Muggles with any spells or guidance on finding where they want to go... because of that you're constantly working with so many people and you end up meeting the most........ exotic people... to say the least.

One day I was roaming and went into a little alley tucked away in a corner where not a lot of people usually are. Sometimes you can catch teens making out or just a mother trying to breast-feed or something that requires a little more privacy. This particular day I walked over and seemed to have walked onto a Harry Potter Porno Set!

There was a woman and man dressed as a VERY inappropriate Hermione and Snape making out while someone was filming. They where giggling and saying things like ""Miss Granger... you're charm spells might be powerful but not a powerful as the wand in my pocket""

I was utterly confused and didn't want to even approach them... so I let my manger deal with that instead. Pretty much I was right though, they were filming a porno. We assume they wanted to film the outside parts in Hogsmead and then cut to I guess a more... enclosed area to do some... ""private studying""... when my Manager picked up on that they were kicked out of the park and not allowed to return."
IAmA,ffqhmih,t1_ffqfeu0,1580134840.0,"Probably the scariest story came from a mother and daughter who after only one glance at them I instantly knew they had no idea they just stepped into the world of the Walking Dead. They were probably a late 50s and late 20s mother-daughter team and seemed to be the type of scared that wasn't fun for them. Upon realizing this I luckily was acting as a Survivor that day and could approach them easily. I told them, without trying to break the character ""You need to follow me to get out!!"" They latched onto me tightly and I tried to usher them to the nearest Emergency Exit but the mother fainted right as we got there. Luckily it was a slow day so there wasn't a heard of people pushing past us, but because the lighting is so dark and every actor in the maze has earbuds in because of the noise, so the Walkers didn't know she was injured and kept scaring the daughter and reaching out for me. I told the daughter to stay with the mother and ran to the next room for an Assistant. After that, we shut down the maze and the mother was NOT in good condition. The paramedics came I did what I could to help them. She ended up being fine but in that moment it was pretty scary being alone with Walkers surrounding you, a mother and daughter scared out of their mind grabbing onto you for life and being the only ""Survivor"" available to help!"
IAmA,ffqgz26,t1_ffqf7xf,1580134308.0,"Universal Studios is honestly the easiest interview process I've ever been through. They worked so fast on getting back to me as soon as possible after filling out a resume online. Once I was hired I was swept away into the magical Wizarding World and trained to be a Wand Host which was pretty much a whole week of you sitting in a room with a bunch of Harry Potter fans just like you, split up into Houses, and quizzed on various movie and book-related things that any guest could ask about at any time. On top of that, we were able to go ride on ALL the Universal Rides for a team-building day! Probably one of the most fun experiences I've ever had in a work environment and really made long-lasting friendships. As for the Walking Dead, I was crossed trained much later in my year of working there but it was a very easy transition. They pretty much give you ""Zombie Classes"" and fit your specific body type into wonderful costumes. You just need to do the best you can at acting.... well.... DEAD! Putting that lifeless attitude but the aggressive charm into it that they are looking for. I highly recommend this job for anyone who is looking to get into the Acting business since it pretty much opens all its doors for you!"

AskReddit,fflomv7,t3_e480ep,1580042203.0,"After being in the business for a few years now, it's difficult to rank them honestly. It's surprising to fully see the process of how people think and the.... interesting ways they believe they need to escape. I have noticed adults tend to look at the functional and literal side of puzzles versus children tend to absorb the element of ""magic"" that the puzzles can create. 

There was a group I had going through a Titanic-themed room and they definitely were not understanding the puzzles very well. When people tend to get confused they seem to lose interest or they begin to focus on things that don't have a direct connection to the game.... like the ceiling. I will say there are some rooms that require you to do more physical labor such as climbing and crawling but this room specifically doesn't call for that sort of thing and was previously stated before this group started. I honestly looked away from the screen for one moment and before I knew it, they were quite literally trying to ESCAPE the room through the ceiling. Moving around actual equipment and wires just to try. I instantly told them to stop and physically went into the room to talk to them. They apologized profusely so I did let them continue their game. I've seen some worse stuff over the years but this has to take the cake of the most incorrect ways to escape I've seen."
AMA,ffln9fn,t1_ffll4bi,1580041740.0,"I have seen a small portion of his videos because my husband frequently watches him, but not too much for me to fully know what he does. Does he in some way relate to escape rooms or create things for them?"
AMA,ffln1pl,t1_fflklgv,1580041648.0,"I actually have heard of this place! I believe a few friends of mine went last year to see it or something of the sorts. Looking at their website is incredible. I would love to see the art community such as this really get their hands on creating something interactive like an escape room in Los Angeles or more places around the world honestly. One of the biggest appeals to players is to feel like you're being immersed in a whole new world. Disney and Universal are great at this and if Escape Rooms can create those same feelings I believe they could be very successful.

Personally, a place dedicated to Fantasy like escape rooms would be pretty amazing. Things that have you travel back into the magical medieval ages with wizards and dungeons would be such a fun experience. I have seen things similar to these kinds of themes not only in Los Angeles but also online. Here is an example of what I mean: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etl\_JrzCyO4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etl_JrzCyO4)"

Though finding a company that will showcase your room and also the money it will take to set up and possibly keep running or updating can be challenging.

I believe an escape room company that ONLY does Fantasy rooms would be a wonderful idea considering people seem to lean mostly towards those themes."
AMA,fflhk7l,t1_fflgusg,1580039748.0,"That's a very interesting idea! I have had groups that can be very competitive with each other and we do our best to work with them to make their experience extra special. We come up with point systems, leaderboards, and if people want us to give away a certain prize or be the in-between distributer on bets then we do our best to give them that help."
AMA,fflgcir,t1_ffldrxt,1580039350.0,"In a way you are right, some places are designed to be focused on more team building or family fun centers but I will say they are not all like that. There are some pretty intense horror Escape Rooms that are pleasantly surprising and feels like you're really going against something for your life. I'm definitely one of those people who love horror and horror mazes so these kinds of Escape Rooms are my cup of tea, but even ones with an 18+ age limit can sometimes be a little intense though some aren't horror-themed.

I have heard of Haunted Houses that require you to sign an almost 40 page wavier that really makes the stakes real and are even allowed to touch you! Personally I wouldn't be fond of this, but for the people who do want that thrill, I think an escape room that has these elements incorporated wouldn't be too bad of an idea!"
AMA,fflfcqx,t1_ffldr1d,1580039022.0,"It really all depends on the game. Some rooms are more ""thinking"" puzzles and some are more ""doing"" puzzles. Probably the best thing I will say is checking ALL your surroundings. Under things, over things, and general nooks and crannies you wouldn't think much about otherwise. Most escape rooms are designed to hide secrets and force you to explore places almost invisible."

Yeah okay sure youre sorry. People who have cancer are usually kind and generous people when the people who dont have cancer should be more generous and kind to them!"
FuckYouKaren,fc2ewpj,t3_efi1yd,1577356241.0,Youre not in the wrong. People have certain expectations of others by inserting their own values into it. Its great that shes pretty much going to out herself of being a Karen to her facebook friends. But maybe they are all too lol
FuckYouKaren,fc2emkn,t3_efol42,1577355767.0,OOOOH now i understand... THIS is how the sith first started
abuse,fc21wjo,t3_efjra0,1577337155.0,I want to say I'm extremely sorry for that happening to you. Its very difficult to come to terms with the fact you may have been abused in any way. Im still dealing with it to this day and I have had multiple new wonderful experiences by other people but I STILL deal with ot and its very hard. I hope that you can maybe start healing from that and be able to let go of the pain. It mah not go away all at once but having the best people around you is extremely helpful.

Either way thank goodness she can't go and bother others with the same problem. She goes to enough of those and pulls the same stunt she could ""make up"" her own lawsuit! Haha"
entitledparents,fbr0262,t3_ee6dza,1577037531.0,Thats so dumb! My mom has an air bnb that she does full time and she eventually started asking ME to clean the entire thing which takes a lot of time and energy that I didn't sign up for. And if I don't i have to pay HER to hire a cleaning service or for her to do it. Its her business! Not mine! I already pay rent!! Hope you dont stay in trouble for too long!
entitledparents,fbqzgz1,t3_ee6m40,1577037335.0,My mom use to do things like that. Hopefully your mom doesn't end up doing that for bigger and more important things!
entitledparents,fbqz25e,t3_ee7l3o,1577037197.0,It really sucks that Administrators deal with so many awful people that when people who aren't trying to cause any trouble come around they are so automatically numb to it all so they decide not to be any help to the situations. Maybe working in an environment like that... you need to be that way or people will walk all over your kindness.
entitledparents,fbab5fe,t3_ec9v9b,1576672708.0,How the hell do people become this way. Its like they missed out on very important learning skills while growing up so now the world is like twisted in their brain to think they are always right.
