AskReddit,fmddkil,t1_fmb6gt3,1585965153.0,The worst night i ever had homeless was when I slept on this sofa dragged out next to a river. I opened my eyes hours later and it was dark. I didn't understand until I tried to move. I had been covered in heavy snow through the night. I was so cold my arms and legs felt like rusty mechanical parts. Getting up was like deadlifting 200 lb sideways. I stumbled to many friends doors trying to ask for warmth for a hour...either they didn't answer or didn't let me in. I had about 75 cents so i went to McDonald's ordered a ice cream cone because it was the cheapest thing they had. Watched it melt for 15 minutes and went on my way. Didn't feel much warmer to be honest. That's what motivates me to keep a roof over my head...that fucking night
opiates,fmcq0ek,t3_ftvjvp,1585950524.0,"They're all regulated the same was for the most part. You can have opiates in your system. Actually its kinda don't ask don't tell they want you to keep using until you get to a dose of methadone that helps you. There are 5 phases. Basically each phase is to allow you to take more doses home with you. Phase one you have to go everyday, my clinic is closed on Sundays so I get an extra for Sunday, not all clinics do that. But I've used for months on and off for years never had them drop my dose down. The only drugs that will make you lose 10mg is benzos, and if you have alcohol in your system you'll be put on a daily breathalyzer for 30 days, if you blow hot you wont get your dose, but methadone has such a long half life you won't feel bad at all its a cake walk. So phase 5 is the only phase where they watch you piss, just because you'll get two weeks worth of methadone at a time. And in my state you can smoke weed on phase five but you have to get 2 UAs a month
Honestly methadone saved my life. Plus if I relapse they wont lower my dose or kick me out. Plus counseling once a month, and resources for just about anything you might need to get back on your feet. Subs never worked for me so methadone was a god send"

So besides knowing who you're giving to is doing the right thing, also know that money is the best thing you can give. Theres a lot of evidence that shows giving shoes, and clothes can contribute to more poverty. If a person in a third world country wants to open a clothing store it can be nearly impossible to make a profit when everyone gets their clothes for free. Why buy them when you get them for free through donations? Then because of this their economies suffer. Also those big metal clothing donation bins are fucked up too. They give a small percentage of the clothes to charity, and take the rest, and turn them into industrial rags then sell them for a profit. Something that is really good to donate though besides money, is your old car if you can afford it. A car can turn a persons life around it opens up a world of possibilities. Also I think I heard this quote from Blue Bloods, or Criminal Minds?? But it was ""if you have to choose between making a car payment or a house payment, always choose the car. You can sleep in your car, but you can't drive your house"" On kinda a unrelated note...I once saw a billboard asking people to donate their old boats to charity, kinda like the car thing. But I don't understand how that would help someone in need. Maybe someone can explain that to me. It also threw me off because I live in Colorado. Ya you can boat here but owning a boat is definitely more of a luxury than a way to make a living. Here in Colorado at least."

AskReddit,f8elq0r,t1_f8dhgpd,1574530151.0,"The first time I had cancer all my ""friends"" crowded the room for my first chemo treatment. The nurse came in and the first thing she said in front of everyone was ""they won't be here for more than a month for you"" I was in shock, everyone was pissed about that statement. All but one stopped talking to me in less than a month. Even less time for them to stop visiting for my chemo appointments. As for the nurse, she was my favorite nurse there during my treatment. The second time I had cancer I was living with 5 friends in a huge house. They showed up to maybe two or three chemo appointments. This time the cancer was worse, so I had to do inpatient chemo treatments that took two weeks in the hospital of 24/7 chemo getting pumped into me. For my bone marrow transplant I was there a month. Same thing with friends the one friend show would show up when he could, he was there for the first time as well. I lived with him. My mom kicked me out when I turned 18 and a few months later I found out I had cancer. He wasn't there often but at least it was something. The ""friends"" at the house would steal my pain meds to get high. So when I got home I suffered HARD. And they got mad at me for confronting the about it. They would call while I was in the hospital ""can I smoke a bowl of your weed"" ""can I have a small amount of your food"" those kinda things. I'd get home everything was gone, and they acted like it was no big deal, and that I was the dick for being upset at them. After my month in the hospital for my bone marrow transplant a social worker had to check the house to make sure it was clean enough for me to go home because my immune system was gone. They knew it had to be clean, but it was trashed. I wanted nothing more than to go home..and they almost ruined it for me. I begged the social worker to let me stay... literally crying. I hated being at the hospital so much, I wasn't allowed to leave my room at the hospital for safety reasons. They were so mean to me when I was home. One week home, two weeks hospital. I isolated myself in my bedroom I was so depressed. It changed me, my girlfriend of 5 years left me right after I went into remission...I don't blame her. She probably would of left sooner if I didn't have cancer. But watching someone getting poisoned and bed ridden couldn't be easy. I became a heroin addict after remission as well. This was because I told my doctors I needed help getting off the pain meds. They freaked cut me off and that was that. Actually Reddit was part of the reason I was able to find a heroin dealer. I was so depressed at this point I didn't really care what happened to me. The one friend who stuck with me started hanging out with one of those dicks at my old house and never spoke to me again. After living with him for 5 years and being best friends since freshman year of highschool. But I'm doing better now though. Still have some really rough times but compared to before I'm a million times better. I have one good fishing buddy friend, and a good co-worker friend. And a new girlfriend, I've had a few ups and downs with her but not she's really trying to do better. So overall I'm happy now. All this isn't even the tip of the iceberg of all the shit I've gone through in my life. Actually it's maybe a 5th if that.

Outside the enclosure put up a sign on each of the 4 walls. This is so people come to admire the hobo. They stare at the sign, either clap with approval at him or shake their heads in shame. To feed him wait until food just barely starts to rot. Pause the game and put the old rotting food in his cage he'll eat it. Then trash builds up, and he shits himself daily, making it more like a natural hobo environment. But be warned one day with a different family you might try to do the hot tub trick and throw a party...then Mr. Hobo might show up... awkward...who the fuck let him out I wonder?"

So he got a white friend to make a offer on the house, and it got accepted. The next day the guys dad shows up with a lawyer explaining someone can legally make a offer for a house in his name, and that he now owned the house. The real estate agent lost his shit, then got in a fist fight with the lawyer, after it calmed down the agent was begging them not to move in fearing for his job, saying your people don't live here why do you want this house.

And finally, drowning...I hold my breath in real life until I wake up gasping for air. 
All of these dreams are vividly realistic. Some to the point whwr when I wake up I don't know what's reality. I had a dream my sister dying my hair pink. I went to the store, bought black hair dye, got home and walked into the bathroom and saw that my hair wasn't dyed. A few days ago I drifted off watching a stream of that game Ancestors a Human Odyssey. I swore that there was a part where a nest of large ants attacked the group while forging. I woke up figured that part was where I passed out. So I scrolled through the episode couldn't find that part.

opiates,eyscp00,t3_cy5936,1567393847.0,"Let me tell you about how fucking useless the Suicide Hotline is. They don't want to talk to help you...well they do want to help but it's complicated. It's like a legal obligation thing. They're not counselors they're not there to talk you down. There job is to figure out your name, then location and send police to your house to take you to a hospital and put you on Suicide watch. A 72 hour hold. Let's look at these problems. One police, you are suicidal. They are not what you want in that state of mind. Suicide by police is way to easy. I've met amazing police officers, and I've met scum of the fucking earth. You don't get to choose. Also you have drugs on you, you've probably told the hotline you have drugs, now the police know you have drugs. Now to be fair this is what they'll do if you make a suicidal claim and don't give a location. They'll try to get you to a hospital or treatment center on your own first. But if you're an opiate addict. Imagine being forced to withdrawal for 72 hours against your will, while suicidal. Sounds lovely right? Ok with that said I would like to give my personal solution. Not one thing works for anyone but here's what saved my life. Being a heroin addict, every bridge was burned I hated myself everyone hated me (maybe not hated but I was a burden) if I had more than enough dope to get through the day I had a personal choice of do I want to try to kill myself with the leftovers or get by another few hours comfortably. I tried SO hard to die. My tolerance was so high it never worked,  I even drank antifreeze one day. Nothing would kill me. I was genuinely hopeless. By a crazy set of circumstances, ironically a money scam, I ended up in a methadone/ Suboxone clinic. I already had Medicaid which almost all take. (I'll get back to this keep reading) these clinics have a don't ask don't tell thing, that all methadone clinics basically do is low key tell you to keep using until your dose can be risen high enough to take effect. And they'll raise it as fast as legally possible. It does not take very long before you wake up one day and you're not sick...it's a seriously euphoric feeling. Like being set free. These clinics provide so much for you. You can get counseling twice a week. They'll help you find housing, help you get a job, help you with legal issues. If you don't qualify for Medicaid out of pocket it's $80 a week and you can apply for financial assistance to make it affordable for you. Probably much cheaper than what you spend a week on opiates. If you don't qualify for Medicaid it's probably because you have a job that pays too much to qualify. But most that are deep into addiction don't have a job. If you do have a job there's a chance you have monthly scripts. This is no different from a script. It's for when you are...as they say sick and tired of being sick and tired. Plus your doctor doesn't help you with housing, counseling, and a job. Ya sorry you won't be getting high from methadone, even if you are it won't be for long but...No. More. Withdrawal. I bring up methadone more because subs never helped me, but they do offer them as well. Also they won't kick you out for slipping up. As long as you don't use benzos or alcohol (federal thing) smoke weed everyday. I popped hot for opiates, coke meth, weed (I'm better now clean for the most part sometimes smoke weed here and there) but they won't drop your dose or kick you out as long as you don't take benzos or drink. Honestly I think for most people it seems like too much work to get into a clinic. It's not, took me a couple weeks to get Medicaid, also Medicaid will pay you back for anything medical you pay out of pocket while the application goes through. Honestly I live in Colorado, if you send me a personal message I will personally drive you to the human resources building and help you apply for Medicaid. As long as you don't live super far from me. My car will be in the shop for a week but I'll try to help you out anyway I can, just message me. I'll take you to a clinic to apply.  Once you're in they'll help you from there. They'll help you find a ride to get there and everything else I mentioned. Yes it's not being ""clean"" but who cares? It's putting your addiction on pause until you can get your shit together and get truly clean when you're ready, and they'll help you with every step of the way."
