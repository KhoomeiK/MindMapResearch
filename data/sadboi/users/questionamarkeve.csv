entertainment,f29y2u3,t1_f28c72o,1570105888.0,"Have you ever thought that maybe the world has become so cruel that even children are experiencing that impact? What if the pawn of a child you're talking about is actually a child that's started to think critically because she has to otherwise she wouldn't be able to survive? I get what you mean when you tell me that if a nation really wanted to do something about climate change, they would do something about it. But, that's my point‚Äîthey aren't. The nations have become so negligent of the world that children have to speak for themselves and for their own future. Otherwise, would they need to? Did you think that the government would just do something about climate change at a larger cost that they're accountable for without a certain push? If you've really grown up, you'd know they don't give a shit if it'll save them a penny not to give a shit.

That's also a pretty privileged POV. You think the world can just get behind carbon tax and magically use shit friendlier to the environment when this economy literally capitalizes on better alternatives? With the poverty this world is in, if you want clean air and sustainability, you'd really have to make that accessible and possible to EVERYONE which it isn't. 

I think it's a shame that you call this child a pawn. I think it's stupid you underestimate her when your proposed solution is so privileged. The girl you underestimate proposed a revolt; a mass awakening‚Äîshe screamed fearlessly in the ears of the people behind our declining climate because they are literally the only ones who will be able to create huge changes that metal straws can't. Wake up. Jesus."

depression,ey26wp1,t3_cpidz8,1566727790.0,"I feel the same way. Sometimes, in my own home, I would feel so restless. I would get out of my room and into the guest room and I would have no idea why I'm lying there. I would be there for around half an hour before I scout a new location and my favorite place is the shower. I literally just sit there for an hour, without showering. After an hour or two, I would be out of there and be in my bed again.

I have a boyfriend who loves me, friends who support me, a family I can somewhat tolerate now more than I ever did back then, but sometimes there's just that homesick feeling for some place you've never been to... Or for some person you never met‚Äìsome person you never held. 

Yesterday, I did this room hopping habit again and as I laid in the guest room bed, I told myself, ""I don't feel at home in my own home at all.""

Then I started crying when I got back to my room.

I have a strong feeling that maybe the person that I miss is just a part of me I never got to redeem.

I might start seeing a psychiatrist. I might go to therapy... I'm scared."

I think the role of Kiki and/or Rebecca exemplifies that *yes, the kids were confused* **but** at the same time, they wonder. I'm pretty sure that most of them are irked into being wives someday and I'm sure a lot of them do not really want that to be the case. I think that even though Gilead is the world they knew, they see all the cruelty openly exhibited and I'm sure they know what empathy, remorse, and fear is."

Serena is so attractive, sometimes it's so impossible to hate her whenever I forget that, oh, she instigated all these mass rapes and killings and brainwashed people into thinking it was the right thing to do. She had redemption arcs though, that I honestly squealed at because I always feel like I'm allowed a short time to not feel bad about liking her and/or being attracted to her.

I also feel this way with Aunt Lydia. I never know what to feel about her especially after seeing her backstory. Still, though, she's not exactly to love like Serena."

Is she brave? Yes. Is she stupid? Yes. Is she a feminist? No. Of she were, she would think more of the people involved, but no. She is a walking calamity.
