PanPorn,fqdmzjt,t3_ge6p23,1589292956.0,I just bought this because it looks so pretty in the picture lol
PanPorn,fpjtmpz,t1_fpjds8y,1588680653.0,Never tried that one but this one is so good I‚Äôve ordered it twice they also have many flavors. It‚Äôs almost like a gel oil it‚Äôs very unique.
PanPorn,fp9ji2s,t1_fp8wach,1588427779.0,I think it‚Äôs more targeted for fine lines and wrinkles but it‚Äôs always good to keep hydrated. If you have problems with eye bags I hear the origins ginzing one is good or you could use those eye gel patches they‚Äôre cheap on amazon.
PanPorn,fp8krd4,t1_fp8g53p,1588394916.0,It‚Äôs a little too expensive right now but it was a very high quality eye cream
dogs,fm0u0hj,t3_fs1nnx,1585666148.0,"Trust me anyone who had adopted a rescue I‚Äôm sure can related to the brutal process. It seems kind of overkill like 98% of people who want to adopt are completely normal and have the capabilities of taking care of an animal it‚Äôs almost like they don‚Äôt want to home the dogs. 

I had an incident where puppies were coming over from the Caribbean and I was so excited to meet one in particular I was told I would get to meet her in person and have a home visit at the same time once they got to America. Within a few days the dog was adopted to someone else most likely someone they knew it was heartbreaking and a betrayal to me I am still bitter about it. How could they schedule a meeting and not even follow through? 

Anyway once it‚Äôs all over it‚Äôll be worth it but it is extremely annoying. Where do you live? For us Pennsylvania was a much more lax state to adopt a dog from."
mentalillness,f6x3nco,t3_dtk10i,1573241195.0,From my experience I‚Äôve never gotten a concrete diagnosis complete with a definitive ‚Äúyou have ___‚Äù it‚Äôs been discussed over time that I have many different symptoms and we treat them and after 2 years of monitoring bipolar 2 was given as a ‚Äúdiagnosis‚Äù but really it was more like ‚Äúdo you think you have bipolar?‚Äù Like you tell me haha. Your experience might be different.
mentalillness,f6mg6xc,t3_drzq30,1572972453.0,"I know it feels terrible but this means the people around you who are mandated reporters are doing their jobs. They see you suffering and want to get you help try to think of it that way. If your mom doesn‚Äôt think it will help then a psychiatrist will most likely be your best option. I don‚Äôt know what it will mean for you and your parents now that cps is involved your dad May need to take parenting classes or you may need to move residence. I‚Äôd do your best to keep your distance from him during this process that may mean staying with friends or spending more time in your room at home. 

You deserve to be well never forget that. I wish you luck."

NewJerseyMarijuana,eyc9fhg,t1_eyc92z4,1566998584.0,Lol right that is funny. What a big baby.
NewJerseyMarijuana,eyc8924,t1_eyc7of4,1566998080.0,Why wouldn‚Äôt they take kindly to me asking about getting a medical card in my own state and the length of the process.
OCPD,eyc50uj,t3_cwh6jh,1566996615.0,"My husband has ocpd and the way he describes money and spending is he wants the most bang for his buck always. He doesn‚Äôt believe in going out to eat because you basically just shit it out but a video game for example gives hundreds upon hundreds of hours of enjoyment. 

Maybe if you focus on quality of the items you need like shoes for example. They don‚Äôt have to be over $100 or anything but do your research and get something quality that will last you a long time maybe that will help some of the guilt."
OCPD,ewrnyki,t3_cpq7wb,1565709888.0,I don‚Äôt have ocpd but I have mdd which has taken a lengthy time of trying different cocktails of medication. I am also on a low dose of an anti psychotic and it worked wonders. I wish they would change the name so it‚Äôd sound less scary.
mentalillness,ew89kru,t3_cn6e16,1565206075.0,I read a book called my lovely wife in the psych ward it‚Äôs told from the perspective of the husband/carer I think it may make you feel not so alone.
work,es4c6qt,t3_c5uoj2,1561581617.0,Saying again means this has happened before. Have you considered maybe you‚Äôre depressed? Most jobs are never super fulfilling but it seems you have such a hard time with work you find yourself quitting. Are you in therapy or on medications? Just trying to get a fuller scope on your story.
mentalillness,eq40a3x,t3_bx2eet,1559766508.0,"What exactly is it about your anxiety that makes him so unable to cope? Does he feel like he can‚Äôt soothe you, or that your meltdowns are too much to handle? I‚Äôm happy that you saw when you needed to go to the doctor. I know medication seems scary but it will help so much in the long run trust me. I have major depressive disorder which had a lot of anxiety undertones, intrusive thoughts and that type of thing. Once properly medicated I could actually be at peace and not have a thousand thoughts going through my mind at once. I wish you luck, your boyfriend sounds like he loves you but is also suffering. You could try couples counseling but it‚Äôs important to have support in the end."
mentalillness,eonntwg,t3_bs6jqz,1558717151.0,I‚Äôm also building a mental health sleeve! All my dark imagery or stuff from my childhood on the back and encouraging beautiful things where I can see it all the time. Kinda like that stuff is behind me kinda thing.
