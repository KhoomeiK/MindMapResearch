HeavenlyHost,fl0mfat,t3_flezq8,1584710591.0,"So, basically:
BoS follows one of the wrong endings of Blood Covered, where everything goes back in time to before they perform the charm and get into Heavenly Host. Only Satoshi remembers what happened, so he tries to stop the guys from doing the charm but fails; they go another time to the cursed school with him trying to not make the same mistakes and escape definitely this time.

The great majority of the game happens in this timeline, but not all of it; BoS is more of an encyclopedia for the events of the game than a story by itself; you just watch the events and make a cronology on it yourself.

Blood Drive is the sequel to Book of Shadows. Simple as it can be. It finished the Heavenly Host saga and creates the link to Corpse Party 2: Dead Patient."

Smoke anything, not everytime you'll have the money for smoking an expensive brand. Also the more time you smoke the more you get interested in stronger cigarettes, so you'll eventually switch brands. If you want to choose a brand now, just choose the one you like the most; it can be because of the flavour, the smoke temperature, the dizzyness, the status of that brand pr anything else. Just choose the one you feel better at smoking. And the more important, have fun with it!"
