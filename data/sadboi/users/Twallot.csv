BabyBumps,fr2mp5h,t1_fr2lwjj,1589840009.0,I've read that too but I think it might be only for the US. I'm in Canada and there is a thing called extended benefits where you get some extra coverage if you work for a good union. My husband is going to call his to find out but I'm pretty sure it's rare for benefits to cover pumps (even though they cover sleep apnea machines and stuff).
BabyBumps,fr2fkjl,t3_gm6rha,1589836419.0,"I'm a first time mom too and only 17 weeks, but I already have my registry done because it's fun and I am a bit neurotic. I have like 130 things on my Amazon registry. My registry is also my reminder list where I throw things on that people recommend. I am planning on waiting til my shower then just buying everything else on there. I put a bit of clothes because I need some specific items but I already have so many hand-me-downs and I've seen nightmares of women getting like 100 onesies. I also want good quality, safe stuff so the more specific items I put on the less likely people will go out and think ""she'll need soothers"" and buy cheap plastic ones ... And have 20 people think the same way. Adding everything also makes sure everyone can afford at least something if they want or can throw in a random $5-10 item with a bigger one.

My registry includes: 

Clothing and hats for summer/older age (baby due in October), swaddle sacks, socks, hats, some cute things etc ... BTW I am not revealing gender until after my shower in August so people don't get too obsessed with clothes

Baby cutlery/bowls/cups/etc., soothers, bibs, teethers, bottles, milk storage bags

Baby Tylenol/advil, baby Care kit (thermometer, snot sucker, nail clippers, etc.)

Swaddle and receiving blankets, mattress covers, changing pads

Baby bath tub, baby shampoo, baby lotion, baby oil, baby towels and cloths

Books and toys - even though it'll be a year or two til they can appreciate most of them it's fun to start collecting and people like to buy them. 

Random stuff like covers for car seats, VaVa night lights, nursing night gowns for hospital and home

Bigger things like a Jolly jumper, activity centre, baby carrier, baby Bjorn bouncer, whatever. 

I don't expect everything obviously but most of my stuff is only 10-30 bucks so everyone can pick stuff and have fun and my family can buy bigger stuff. I have money to buy it all on my own so I don't expect anything but it's more for everyone else to get to have fun buying baby stuff while also not having everyone buy me the same things over and over.

I'm planning on giving the registry to family first and talking to them about whether they want to go in on things like a breast pump or stroller or whatever I haven't gotten myself yet. Then I'm going to take the stuff over $100 off before sending it to friends so they don't feel like they need to worry about them lol."
BabyBumps,fr0yrrk,t1_fqydqd3,1589809798.0,"This is what I'm afraid of. I spent a long time picking good quality, reasonably priced items for everything.

I also have so many clothes given to me from my friend (who got so much clothing at her baby shower she used almost none of it) that I only put specific clothing that I actually need or that is ""special"" so I want no clothes other than that. I am not telling the gender until after my shower so I am hoping that mitigates the senseless clothing shopping people like to do. I feel like it is ungrateful to feel this strongly about it, but I have enough money to buy everything I need/want and I am not into people wasting their time and money. I only have the registry because people want me to have one but I feel like there is going to be a problem anyway and I'll just have more work having to return items that are poor quality or that I have 6 of."

AmItheAsshole,fqvsmof,t1_fqvrnmn,1589684262.0,"Thanks! I'm honestly a little worried but he will be taking 2 months of parental leave at the beginning then he works in camp so when he's home between shifts he doesn't have to work. I'm planning on breast feeding. I'm hoping the baby can do both bottles with pumped milk and my breasts, but if not I guess we'd have to work something out. I'm actually a night owl so I might not mind the early parts of the night but I sleep best between 3am onward so that's when I'll start getting upset. More than anything I think it would just piss me off having him not wake up haha. 

I was wondering if a monitor would work. He did used to have to wear ear plugs to deal with my sleep apnea but it doesn't bother him anymore. Maybe I'll get lucky. He doesn't wake up to the cats meowing/being assholes so that's what is making me think it might be a bit of a problem. He usually will roll over if I ask but sometimes he'll barely move or just say ""I'm on my side already"" and fall back asleep so he definitely is pretty out of it even when I can get him to wake up."
AmItheAsshole,fqvp8gm,t1_fqvm1ls,1589682107.0,So what do you plan to do if she has to leave you alone with the baby for multiple days? And do you seriously not use alarms to get up for anything?
AmItheAsshole,fqvof2x,t1_fqvnja4,1589681598.0,"I don't know but telling her it's her fault he isn't able to take care of the baby at night is ridiculous. And for him to not understand why she would rather just get up is also him just being obtuse. Who wants to lay there and listen to their baby cry for multiple minutes while also shaking their grown partner awake. It would be 10× easier and less infuriating to just get up. 

I think the only option they have is for them to sleep in separate rooms if possible where he sleeps with the baby in the room or the monitor right by his face on his nights. I imagine he wakes up to alarms eventually to go to work or something unless he has relied on other people his whole life to get up for work and appointments. Or he can shift his sleep times, which isn't really beneficial if he is working right now and has to work in the mornings.  

I know it's hard to change sleeping habits, I have some pretty horrible ones myself. But his attitude about this is crap. She technically shouldn't get mad at him for something he can't help, but I can't see how it wouldn't cause so much resentment having your grown ass husband lay in bed needing to be prodded awake for minutes on end like a teenager when his baby is crying.

Also... What if she ends up needing to leave him alone with the baby for a few days because of an emergency or just because she deserves a vacation after a while? Does she need to hire a babysitter because her husband can't wake up to a baby crying? I just don't see how she can't be stressed and fed up to the max over this and he is acting like it's just a simple solution of her taking on more emotional labour in the middle of the night."
AmItheAsshole,fqvlbgg,t3_gl6dny,1589679703.0,"YTA. I'm already discussing this issue with my husband because he takes a lot to wake up and we'll be having a baby in October. If I have to wake up enough to wake him up and make sure he actually gets up then what the fuck is the point of him getting up if we are both fully awake. I have a difficult time sleeping so it would be useless to me to have to spend that much energy waking another adult u since I wouldn't sleep again anyway. We're pretty sure that on his nights I'm going to go sleep in the basement room, but I'm hoping he just learns to wake up to the baby crying. We are having the baby sleep in our room the first couple months so that should help, but when the baby goes into their room we'll have to figure out a plan so the baby isn't neglected and I don't go insane from having to wake my husband up. 

If my husband ever told me it was my job to wake him up to take care of our baby I would be pissed. You need to figure out something instead of making it her job.

Edit: and it doesn't matter how much you do during the day. It's nice you try to offset it but it's not the same thing as her getting uninterrupted sleep at night. Lots of people don't nap well during the day (I don't) and also they deserve to get a normal sleep too."

I don't know the circumstances that caused her to block you, but I feel like maybe you were being too full-on and she wasn't sure you'd take no for an answer. It isn't a mature way to deal with it, but girls and women have to de Al with guys feeling entitled so often that sometimes it feels like just completely cutting off contact is easier rather than possibly deal with harrassment and abuse. One time I stopped talking to a guy on a dating site and he messaged me multiple paragraphs of abuse that ended with him gleefully describing my cats eating me when I died all alone.

AmItheAsshole,fqro76z,t3_gkkm6f,1589588370.0,NTA. Who the hell does this enough that it becomes a problem? You'd think she would find it more annoying having to bring her boyfriend toilet paper while he's shitting than just putting more toilet paper on in the first place.
AmItheAsshole,fqrm6by,t1_fqrldvo,1589587166.0,"I know you were. I'm not saying you were purposely being an asshole. However, I do still feel like the idea of going out to get this really important thing that you knew he was looking at getting might have some sort of underlying issue with it. Especially considering how invested you still are in it. My sister does this kind of stuff where she gets a grand idea in her head about ""helping"" people or buying gifts that she knows people need but a lot of the time it's more her wanting to insert herself into something important and sometimes it comes across more like she is doing it for herself than for other people. She is doing it from a good place but I think underlying it is that it's more about making herself feel good and needed and important. Sometimes the things she does ends up being more of a pain in the ass than anything else and she gets too emotionally wrapped up in it. Also, your idea of an expensive bike might be not nearly what he was looking at. I've been looking at strollers that are like $500 (Canadian). Someone could buy me a $300 one which is still expensive and good quality, but I was willing to pay the $500 out of my own pocket for what I really wanted. 

I think you need to let it go and just accept that it didn't work out. You weren't being an asshole before (though I think you were misguided) but definitely continuing with the emotional response to this is pretty asshole-y. People are allowed to not like gifts and he might just feel awkward and want to forget about it. Just buy him something different or take him to dinner."
AmItheAsshole,fqrkkla,t3_gkjjdo,1589586232.0,"YTA. Why wouldn't you get him literally anything else? That's a pretty important thing for him to not be able to pick out and buy himself. It's weird you are fixating on this. I hate it when people buy me important stuff I'll use daily just because they hear I am looking at the item. I'm having my first baby and if someone went out and bought me a cheap stroller randomly after I spent forever researching them and picking out a good quality one I wanted I would be annoyed. It's controlling and undermining, even if your sentiment wasn't. It's okay to have hurt feelings, but to keep making him feel bad and harping on it when you know the situation is making you the asshole here."

AmItheAsshole,fqrhmhw,t1_fqrgxxe,1589584528.0,"I mean, that's just not realistic and I doubt you actually follow that when you are driving. Have you never been in a really busy parking lot with people walking constantly? If you are waiting to pull forward and a space between pedestrians opens up then you aren't going to not go forward because someone is walking behind your vehicle. I could totally see not seeing someone randomly hunched over behind your vehicle. If the timing worked out that it happened as she was pulling forward the way it is described then she would have been looking forward and to her immediate sides to not hit people or cars that are actually in her pathway. It's not like she can stare at the back of her car and look in front of her at the same time."

How were you supposed to know that in that moment someone had suddenly started using the back of your car for support? She was probably leaning over far enough that you wouldn't have noticed her in your rearview mirror. I get they might have been concerned but that is ridiculous. And I am not even going to get into my thoughts on the idea of someone operating a vehicle when they are so elderly and frail that this would cause such an incident.

I'm 16 weeks pregnant and own a home with my husband who I've known for 13 years and somehow still wanted me after watching me be a train wreck as a friend. It's so hard to be ""normal"". I was still drinking heavily until the day I got my positive test (at 4 weeks luckily so no harm) and I hope I can use my experiences to be an understanding and informed parent."

I'm definitely nervous because I know how hard it is from her but I also feel like obstetrics is so much better now than it was 40 years ago. Apparently my poor SIL was so scared her entire pregnancy because of her mom's experience that she couldn't enjoy any of it or relax until her daughter was out and crying. My aunt also had a traumatic birth where her doctor forced her to give birth when the cord was around my cousin's neck which caused cerebral palsy despite nurses begging him to get her in for a c-section. They won a lawsuit for that one.

I am still far off from giving birth but I just try to remind myself that women have so much more power about their care now and that they can find out so much more about the baby's health when you feel something is wrong."

BabyBumps,fqkizii,t3_gj73wd,1589428360.0,"I started out at 192 at 5'4 (still mad at myself because I had been in good shape my whole life until the last few years and I got pregnant before I got back into it). I lost about 12 pounds the first trimester just from eating healthier and not drinking a ton of wine like I had been. I'm  now 16 weeks and still about 180-182 depending on the day. I eat pretty healthy other than some days, like today I guess I am having a sweet tooth and bought so much crap at the store. I also go for walks a few times a week and my job isn't super active but I am a support worker/group home worker so I do spend a lot of time cleaning and shopping and stuff. 

My doctor never said much about my weight. He still said he expected me to gain the regular 25 pounds or whatever but on our call last week he never had anything to say about my weight still not changing. He asks more about my blood pressure which has been good. I've read that 10 pounds is enough for obese women and that you can even not gain weight the entire time if you eat healthy. I eat a really well-rounded diet and was (believe it or not) a hardcore athlete and fitness nut most of my life, so I definitely understand nutrition. I have plenty of fat stores and the reality is that I can eat over 2000 calories a day and maintain weight at this point because of being heavy and getting some exercise. It's pretty hard to be nutritionally deficient on that many calories a day. I'm not going to try to gain or lose or maintain... Just gonna keep doing what I'm doing.

Just go off with what your doctor says. I know I'm going to have a lot of extra joint pains because of the stress from my weight already, but hopefully the pools open at some point so I can get low impact exercise."
BabyBumps,fqcq3ia,t3_ghzekz,1589265289.0,"I'm in the same boat at 16 weeks. I haven't gained any weight and I actually started out 13 pounds heavier because I can't have beer or wine lol. I was overweight and had a bit of a belly already. I am definitely showing and my belly is bigger despite losing weight, but because of the layer of fat on my tummy and being overall chubby I just look fatter most of the time. Even my sweetly honest husband admits if you didn't know you might think I'm just heavier... Except sometimes when I wear maternity clothes. I just got more in and they help a lot. I can't wait to be showing more obviously so I can stop feeling just fat."

You have to gross over a grand a week to get the full benefit, but if you are the main breadwinner or a single parent who is making a decent wage it's kind of shitty to not even get enough to pay for a mortgage and bills when you have been paying into EI for over a decade.

 She did it a couple weeks ago and she reminded me of a fat Little owl so I started laughing. My laughter started getting uncontrollable and I couldn't breathe and was doing that stupid silent laughing. After a minute my husband came over and was like... Are you okay? I kept laughing until I got kind of weirded out by being so out of control and I started bawling. Then I laughed again because it was so stupid. Then I cried again because I peed myself some. I think my husband was kind of freaked out.

My kitty doing something I've seen her do 100 times caused me to have a total emotional breakdown. So stupid lol."
