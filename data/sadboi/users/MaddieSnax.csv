TalkTherapy,foyin7h,t3_ga7244,1588173209.0,"Hey OP, you’re not too much at all. <3 I’m so sorry your therapy isn’t the most helpful right now.

I have anxieties like that too. I’m in a very healthy, loving, fulfilling relationship and I’m attracted to my partner, but sometimes there are thoughts that are like “You’d be better off alone, you shouldn’t be with him, everything would be better if you dropped everything and moved away from everyone. Start a new life” I have absolutely ZERO desire to follow through on these thoughts. But I recognize it as an avoidance tactic, which means I’m afraid and my body and mind are trying to take me away from a perceived threat.

Even if we have different anxieties, most of the time they’re tied to our fight or flight response. Anxiety exists to keep us safe from harm. :) Other times they’re just connections our brain is making and it gets a little confused and “focuses” on a threat or an issue it thinks it has found. You as a conscious being are separate from your brain and body. They function independently from you, which is tough! It means we have less control over what our brains and bodies do, which is scary! 

But you make the choices, you decide what actions you take. You’re showing so much strength. You enduring those thoughts, curled up on your bed, is such strength and resilience. Your body and brain are saying “danger danger!” And you’re enduring that turmoil and fear constantly. Don’t ever think that you are not strong. 

I’ve got some emotional regulation techniques that help me cope with the anxiety, but it’s not a quick fix unfortunately. I also have some resources on shame and PTSD, and I’ve got a really nice song from Steven Universe (kids show, v safe content) that is validating and helpful for dealing with intrusive thoughts. If any of these sound interesting to you, dm or reply and I’ll send them your way :) <3

JusticeServed,foyg3wp,t1_foyd1mx,1588171901.0,"Actually shame is a really bad tool for correcting behaviour, especially those that come from abuse. I’m doing therapy right now and what I’ve learned is that victims of child abuse have really strong “inner critics” and experience feelings of shame in response to many experiences. Blaming oneself is, in one way, an attempt at controlling the situation. “If I’m the problem I can fix it and make things better.”

So instead of shaming the people who make those jokes (which could be people using humour to cope with their own abuse, which is valid) sometimes it’s better to educate or call their jokes like it is: an attempt to find humour and cope with the hard reality of child abuse.

I wish people would trigger warning belts cause it’s a STRONG trigger for me :/ but ahhh well, cant get that information to everyone."

• Stay hydrated. Try to drink water specifically cause the sugar and other stuff in different beverages can cause stones. If you struggle with staying hydrated, let me know and I can give you some tips that help me :)

• Brush your teeth and tongue often. Sometimes the food bits that get stuck in your teeth dislodge and get caught in your tonsils. Brushing after every meal can really help reduce stones, plus it’s great for your teeth!

• Gargle water in the shower. It doesn’t always dislodge stones, but every now and again it will! I got one out in the shower yesterday and it felt great!

• To make extractions easier, start getting used to your fingers and q-tips touching the inside of your mouth. I usually just use my fingers (Please wash your hands with warm water and soap before putting them in your mouth!) to desensitize myself because sometimes the cotton of the q-tip gets stuck in my mouth and it feels like there’s a hair in my throat. Whenever I get a scratch in my throat, or my breath is bad, or if I just think about my tonsils, I give them a little stroke and poke (lol) and then leave them alone.

To have someone so hurtful and able to control the body so much is frightening. Please try to let yourself feel your emotions, don’t shame yourself or criticize yourself, this is some tough stuff and you have a right to be upset, scared, angry, tired, etc.

It seems like Malice has a lot of hurt. She’s hurting the body, yes, but it’s her body too so she’s self harming as well. Which is usually a huge cry for help and very common for DID and CPTSD people. I also have an alter who self harms and tells me and others to kill ourselves. They’re scared, honestly, they’re scared and they don’t know how to cope.

Grounding is the first and most important thing, always. Making sure you, your brain, and your body know that you’re safe in this present moment is necessary. Try to find 5 colours you can see, 4 sounds you can hear, 3 things you can touch (try for different textures and sensations), 2 things you can smell and 1 thing you can taste (I drink water for this usually, hydration is important.:)) Once you’re sure you’re grounded in the present, try thinking about these questions:

1. What does Malice look like?
2. What emotions does Malice feel?
3. What is Malice’s goal, what does she want?
4. What has hurt Malice the most?

These are questions my trauma therapist gave me, so they can bring up some serious memories and feelings. Don’t do the exercise if you’re not feeling safe or if you’re tired. This is the work we put in, and it’s draining. I don’t usually offer these questions to strangers because these questions can be scary and intense to answer, but I read that you were looking for a therapist but the quarantine is making things hard. I’m here for you, and I know you want to put the work in, so here’s some tools to help.

Listening and learning more about Malice herself will help you and the system learn how to help her. Always remember that she’s hurting and she needs help and support and compassion.

I’m so sorry that your life has been unfair and cruel to you. You and your system deserve peace, healthy communication, safety, love and care. Are you safe where you live right now?

Comparing our experiences to others is the best and worst thing we humans do. On one hand it’s great to see that we’re not alone (something humans crave) and we have similar experiences. on the other hand it can make us feel so worthless, alone, invalidated, and insignificant. Please don’t feel any shame for your feelings cause it’s 100% valid and I can assure you that those women also struggle to have the people they want to date notice them too. Opening up about ones feelings is always scary and nerve wracking, being vulnerable is hard.

Try to focus on loving yourself. I know it’s so overstated sometimes, but working on yourself and loving the person you are is the best way to bring loving people around you. You deserve to be loved, cared for, appreciated, listened to, and supported by not only others, but by yourself too. Care for your body because you know it deserves love. It’s a harder lesson to learn than most people think.

I don’t have much dating advice, I’ve always gone for the honest approach. See someone you like/wanna get sexy with?

Don’t stress about losing time and everything. Your alters are going to get you through. Don’t talk to your father at all, avoid engaging with him at all costs, and focus on doing what you need to do (go to work, homework, school, food, etc)

My father has many untreated and unrecognized mental issues and he said the same things to me through abuse. “Everyone is turning you against me” “I’m keeping you safe” don’t try to make sense of it, don’t even listen to it.

I’m not trying to diagnose you. I hope this information will be validating and helpful for you since you’re feeling alone. <3 

Intense emotions are a trait of BPD, borderline personality disorder. As always, be careful if you choose to research it, self diagnosis can be ok but it’s a slippery slope and can cause you more stress and anxiety. I find researching and educating myself on various disorders helpful and calming cause the fear of the unknown is V scary for me. Educating oneself on different disorders can be helpful cause it can be validating seeing one’s experience recognized and can also help with feeling more in control. However it’s important to realize that self diagnosis doesn’t always work. One needs education and experience to be able to properly diagnose someone, but we all know that haha. :) If you think you find a condition that fits your experience, bring it up with your therapist and they can help you look more into it. <3

tonsilstones,fn2301n,t3_fyq87a,1586576487.0,"Honestly? I think I get them when I smoke a lot, maybe it’s because it really dries out my mouth? I’m lactose intolerant so I don’t tend to eat a lot of dairy. 

My stones tend to be pretty small, just little pinhead size stones. And every 3 to 4 weeks or so I find ones to push out, so maybe I’m not the best example."
Didrama,fn1q1ze,t1_fn19re9,1586567473.0,"Big yikes! This whole situation is terrible. It’s so unfortunate that whenever there is a marginalized community that gets some positive attention by the majority, there are those who will attack it and produce negative press for it.

I was so happy when I saw Anthony’s video and that Nin, Nan, and other systems were getting positive representation from someone with reach. No one deserved this outcome. :(

Thank you so much OP for the timeline and to Witness for the additions. As a system who is avoiding this drama for personal safety, I appreciate the updates on the community. 

We’re strong people, we will endure, triumph, and heal from this painful experience.

Much love to you all <3"

You’re not alone. Find the people who will be honest with you and tell you. Those are the people who are looking out for you and won’t ignore you at parties <3

birthcontrol,fn0sz80,t1_fn0qbx6,1586548153.0,"Yeah it seems pretty typical to me. Our hormones control our sex drive IIRC. The hormone levels in our bodies can change, especially from adolescence to adulthood, so if you had a low sex drive before and it’s reduced further, it sounds like your body may be producing less testosterone.

I had quite a high sex drive prior to BC, and gradually overtime it decreased. Now I go through phases of complete disinterest in sex. I switched off the pill to an IUD in 2015/2016, and for about 4-5 months I was not on any birth control (wasn’t a concern cause I’m in a monogamous sexual partnership and pregnancy was already discussed). During that time I was INSATIABLY horny. I wanted my partner over all the time.

I do know that part of my low sex drive is due to PTSD, and sometimes I just can’t relax and feel safe enough to enjoy sex. Obviously I can’t say if this is what you’re experiencing, but I noted it in case it’s helpful for you :)

If you think it’s something more than BC, try talking to a medical professional and get their insight into it. But I’ll be honest, the first test you should do is to go off BC for about 5 months (it can take 3 months to fully clear medication from your system) and see if your sex drive improves. If it doesn’t, you can go back on BC and explore other possibilities. It’s incredibly likely that the BC is the cause though.

TL;DR: Hormones are human spices and influence a lot of our actions. If you don’t think bc is causing it, talk to a doctor because it could be psycho-somatic or something else."

Konosuba,fn035lr,t3_fydne5,1586534602.0,"I don’t know if you’re actually autistic OP, but just in case you aren’t, I wanted to note that many people on the autism spectrum prefer the phrase “I’m autistic” as opposed to “I have autism.” This is because it helps correct the misconception that autism is an illness or sickness that someone has. For example, when I talk about my mental health issues, I say “I have PTSD/depression” as opposed to “I’m PTSD/depression(ed).”

Of course, this is not a firm rule and some autistic people prefer to identify otherwise. Just sharing information I’ve heard from my autistic friends :)

Great edit!"

tonsilstones,fmzvn7b,t3_fyadb9,1586530469.0,"I’m so sorry OP! What a shame :(((( I’m always super paranoid about my breath before I go into interviews. 

I carry a travel toothbrush and toothpaste in my bag, as well as some menthol cough drops. I know these things don’t fully treat the smell (cause the stone is still there) but sometimes it can be strong enough that the stone smell is less noticeable. People may also find it hard to pinpoint the location of the smell this way too ;)

When in doubt, be honest! For example, maybe say “My apologies, I think I have some bad breath right now. Can I take a moment to freshen up?” If it’s really that bad, they’ll probably take you up on it. And if they don’t appreciate the honesty, fuck them! 

Don’t say it’s cause of stones though cause they may not hire you because it’s an ongoing issue, which is shitty and not right cause everyone is stinky sometimes.

Best of luck :)"
