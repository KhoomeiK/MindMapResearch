Everyone who is born, eventually sins. Whether or not a christian believes in age of accountability, is widely varied. Men and women sin, and the wages of sin is death. Every moment spent alive is gracious and God exercising great patience. 

Innocent babies? Sure absolutely. I'm a believer that babies go to heaven, based on scripture. So I'm not sure how you feel after that, but I'd say the babies dont necessarily count as God doing something""wrong"" if they go to heaven. 

But the men and women have sinned, at some point we die because of Adam and eve choice, that of which brought forth sin. Every human being sins so were gonna die. Whenever you do die, God has decided it was time. I'm not sure how him taking someone early is more wrong than taking an elderly person in their 80s or 90s for instance. A lot of atheists cherry pick the parts that seem the worst and I assume it fits your moral stance to say so easily God is wrong.

God promised abraham his seed would multiply, and that it would carry on. This is the nation of Israel that eventually leads to the birth of christ. 

To preserve, god did was necessary, and just because it seems bad to a human who sees murder wrong, does not make it wrong for the one who gives life. Murder was never OUR choice to begin with, it wasnt written on us to murder, because that's Gods place first and foremost. We fell in sin and thus sin brings forth destruction. We murder because we sin. Sin is against God. It's taking his place or replacing him with something else, more or less. 

Not to mention, God warns people of the earth time and time again and thus acts in righteous judgement. These nations practiced cannibalism, sacrificial rituals of children, orgies, etc. Obviously God hates sin, and when these people dont stop, God may step in at some point to intervene of his own will. 

So yeah, objectively it was right. People were warned, they knew what they were doing, they practiced evil and wickedness. God has the right because only he should be taking anyone's life to begin with. 

The old testament has a lot of wrathful parts in it, due to the fact people were heavy in sin during these periods of time, hardened their hearts, and turned away in rebellion against God. Take note, God did not spare his people after escaping in exodus for their unbelief. People who witnessed miracles first hand. Countless times. Yet made a golden calf idol and danced.

Everyone in the world could say killing or stabbing you or someone you care about is okay and you saying that it isnt would be irrelevant, but based on your viewpoint so would theirs. I'm saying it would be wrong regardless of yours or their view. Not because it caused you pain, (who cares about what you go through?)  Or because it upset you or made you sad or angry (so what?)  But because it is wrong to just openly do that. Was Hitler right for mass genocide of Jews? It's not a ""his opnion"" of that matter. Was he right? Were we right to torture slaves? To cheat the native Americans and put them through torment in the trail of tears? 

Because if this is all subjective, it really doesn't objectively matter, and your feelings about it are insignificant. I mean REALLY insignificant. But I know deep within you, someone doing harm to a loved one of yours bothers you deeply, not just because it angers or saddens you, not just because it caused them pain, because... why would you do that to someone? Dont you have a heart? 

If its subjective man, a lot of history wasnt wrong, today things aren't wrong, Donald Trump didnt do a lot of wrong, ISIS isnt wrong, Jeffrey Epstein wasnt wrong, I can go on and on man.

Let me explain why I not only think it's the best argument, but undeniable, irrefutable and is backed by scripture. 

Imagine a world without god. An atheistic world.


No god
________
Morals exist. Absolute good and bad. 

How do these morals help us? In an atheistic view , they play a role in evolution to help our species survive. 

But I beg the question, if there is no God to be accounted for, thus no afterlife beyond our reality, ""morals"" only affect us right now in this life, this one singular life we have on earth, so what?

Why care about our children surviving? What survival purpose does it serve, a purpose that without we wouldn't be better off because of it? What's it matter? I mean if theres no afterlife, I dont need to worry about a hell or standing before God. I can do whatever I want. Because if there was an afterlife that is eternal this life means nothing compared to what comes after. No eternity after, theres nothing to be secure about when your time comes. So who cares? My decisions won't follow me.

Ultimately, it becomes nihilism, of which I used to profess.

If there is a God, thus also an afterlife then my decisions matter. 70-80 years now is nothing to eternity after in my permanent state. My eternity after this life is the bigger picture and what's important because right now is a tiny spec of dust in the universe that is a thousand times bigger than ours and is ever growing (for scale).

If theres a God, and thus an afterlife, and my decisions matter then I must ensure I make the correct choices to the best if my ability to ensure my microscopic seemingly luxorious/miserable/average etc. Isnt heaven compared to the unending and inescapable torture that may follow. 

Logically, this is more convincing that any argument, hands down. Every argument I've seen against scientists, philosophers, etc. I've witnessed they avoid it to a degree and hesitate even a small amount, but enough that its noticable. By this I mean, you can tell they ha e an answer in their head but they think about it. Evolution, everytime. Evolution is pointless in a world where my actions only have consequences in a society that makes up its rules as it goes. If laws were different 60 years ago and changed because we changed our minds, then they weren't correct then and therefore cannot be trusted to be correct now because they have shown to possess flaws in their lawmaking ability. 

If this is true, then they cannot possibly with 100% be sure their laws or morals are correct and they cannot be sure my actions are 100% right or wrong. Slavery was okay once. Genocide was okay once. Drowning people an hearsay was okay once. It didn't matter then and it doesn't now because we make our OWN choices our OWN laws based on how we feel NOW. 

The bible tells us that the law is written on mans heart, and we have a conscience. 

Why is it okay to eat a cucumber and not a baby? 

Because it's wrong and messed up. Any other answer brought forth first is foolishness, and sinister and wickedness, and that person is either lying to themselves or they are mentally ill.

Thing is.. she went to a girls-night-out sleepover the night before this all started. One of the people that was over there actually has done a certain math equation before, and I found through the vine recently. She may have provided it to her. Interesting, I didnt add this to my post but she kept saying when I asked ""whys everyone asking if I'm in something"" and joking about a certain math equation, and did it a few different times. What makes me not fully buy into it is she's had idk maybe 2-3 hours of sleep yesterday and she seemed worse. Today she had a nap wayyy earlier though and she said she felt a little better. 

I'll add this, frequent sniffing as well. The evidence points to it but she is adamant against it, to be expected though."

It made me ponder whether or not she was triggered and it finally started with her or something. It was very similar to my mania but more psychosis effects."
