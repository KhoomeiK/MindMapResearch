StopSelfHarm,fp3o9x8,t3_gaq7k5,1588282833.0,"In my experience, being a year free from self harm means you‚Äôve at least got a handle on most scenarios that would‚Äôve caused you to harm. You‚Äôve gotten rid of the habit, even if you did relapse. The relapse isn‚Äôt ideal, and I know how sucky it feels after being able to be clean for so long but as long as you decide to stop again now then you‚Äôre good. Get back on the wagon and try again üíï"

StopSelfHarm,fhryfo9,t3_f4lfb2,1581844707.0,"I totally hear you and like what was mentioned by another user, you also remind me of myself. I had sometimes done things that could have easily led to self harm such as gripping needles near my arm and holding blades but not actually doing anything. 

I would say if you can, talk to someone you feel safe talking about this to like a counselor, therapist or psychiatrist. In my opinion it‚Äôd be better and easier to prevent self harm and other destructive habits than trying to crawl out of the hole over and over again. 

As for the excitement, I‚Äôm thinking it‚Äôs probably the adrenaline in your body kicking in. It‚Äôs also possible that it‚Äôs for the crave of control or to feel alive. Those were some things that appealed to me before and while I was self harming."

Side effects varies on the dose and it did in my case as well. Generally speaking though I experienced drowsiness, increased anxiety for a bit, nightmares and stomach aches. However, with all this I noticed or at least felt like my thoughts slowed down and stopped screaming at me. I was also able to start going to the gym regularly when before I couldn‚Äôt. 
This is of course all of my own experience but yeah hopefully that helps a bit! 
You can also message me if you want to ask more about it."
