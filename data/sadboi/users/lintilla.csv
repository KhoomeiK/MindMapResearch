I think it's great that he doesn't operate that way, but it absolutely does explain part of the shorter speaking time. An awful lot of time is taken up by rebuttals. (It does NOT excuse or explain ignoring him completely for the first half hour...)"
AmItheAsshole,f8gki0g,t3_e0rq9f,1574561083.0,"NTA. It sounds like you never had a particular interest in owning a bird, but you were still kind enough to take it in and raise it when no one else would or could at the time. You're doing another kind and responsible thing by trying to find it a good permanent home and taking care of it in the meantime even though it annoys you. Your family seems to be all talk, or one of them would step up. You're not a bad owner--the bird sounds like it's been cared for well, and you're mature enough to recognize that it could only be a temporary situation for you, instead of allowing the bird to stick around and be neglected.

If you had intentionally gone in search of bird ownership, I might have a different opinion. This seems more like a foster situation."
