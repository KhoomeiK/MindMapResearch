schizophrenia,ff8ntxi,t3_es8t6e,1579687941.0,"I get delusions about everything i hear talking related. The talking isn't a symptom but my brain makes it one. 

For everything else I figure if it is or isn't a hallucination so long as it wasn't a threat it is best to move on to what is next. The anxiety that comes with it doesn't let up as soon that is decided most of the time though."
schizophrenia,ff8nmsa,t1_ff8m743,1579687637.0,If no change of doc can be done then maybe they can be strong armed via words that you need your specific dose and wont accept anything lower. Mention symptoms worsening- keep a journal including those and the way your appointments have been going. I am sure you have done some of this- their ignoring you is inexcusable given the varied nature of patients with schizophrenia it is important to listen to them.
schizophrenia,ff8mi24,t1_ff8bpaf,1579685894.0,I can't either. Makes me hallucinate and have sleep paralysis.
schizophrenia,ff8lxp6,t3_es7uqq,1579685016.0,"I hope another psychologist or professional gets in charge of your meds so you can have better help with this. 

Is there anyone you can reach out to vent to while coping with family stress? Being the leg to stand on means having less of an outlet because of their dependant relationship with you. 

Good luck moving forward I wish you the best.

Edit: Editting my comment to add that if you want to share music or shows I find that helps distract me from self harm or violent thoughts."

schizophrenia,f0nyafp,t1_f0n9byj,1568785558.0,Sometimes I feel the same despite medication due to high stress.  Because of the medication I get to remind myself and others that the disorganized speech and dissassociation are  temporary.
schizophrenia,f0n7824,t3_d5osnd,1568762389.0,Your Aunt should let you talk to your friend about it instead of flying a helicopter comment to them about your condition. It is your life and the power over it should be exercised by you as much as possible. Be glad people care and respond to it with yourself in mind. Best wishes.
