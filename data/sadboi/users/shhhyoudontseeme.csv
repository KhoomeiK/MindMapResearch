sex,fqrt82n,t1_fqre146,1589591396.0,"Yep! 

And not worth it.

I had super sensitive nipples. Nipple play and orgasms were a great many thing. Just before i turned 30 i thought it would be a WONDERFUL AMAZING thing to pierce my nipples. I already had multiple body piercings & my body has always healed exceptionally well and this one was gonna be awesome. 

When I told my husband what i was doing, his only response was ""please don't"". It was the 1st time he'd asked me not to do something and damn i should've listened.

I can say they sure looked beautiful. That was the only good thing. 
They hurt constantly and they still couldn't be touched after a couple months. Eventually things got better but i could already tell there was a significant loss of feeling and they just never felt fully healed. Then my body started rejecting them. 

I took them out before they pushed out

Lost 100% feeling in my left nipple and most of my right. 
So. Not. Worth. It.

As long as you're ok with how silly it looks, it can. 

You have to  leave the female condom in anally and because the outer portion is so much bigger it will usually cover any of your outer area to allow easier back and forth with less chance of transfer. 


Like others have said, it's not a good idea to go back and forth due to bacteria etc, but using a female condom and  having some wipes or something for him to wipe his hands off occasionally it is possible. 

Just know nothing is 100% and its still possible to transfer bacteria this way even being super careful.

Its worked for us with no issues so far.

**1st off my apologies as i think i did a boo-boo and high jacked your comment. Didnt mean to. I'm tired have takena an evil Ambien and reading your story hit me hard and next thing i know i have a damn novel**

My son's cat died when he was in middle school. They bonded immediately and she had a pretty tragic start in life when we found her. She was only 3 and a very healthy cat when she died (so we thought)  I found her that morning after he had left (Well, one of the dogs took me to her under the table)

See he too was very very sensitive and I just knew if he came home to find out it would've broken him. 

My husband grew up with animals chained (not forgotten) outside. They didn't come into the house, weren't considered  family etc... so he downvoted my plan because he had never wenr thru this type of thing being ""emotional"" to him, if something was dead. It was dead. Move on. And he worried what the potential outcome could be, if it would be too upsetting for him. Except i knew the other potential outcome... he'd lose his shit..shut down.... he'd dwell over the fact he had a good day that day or something while she was dead type thing. Aspie kids minds work a bit more complex than others. 

So I called my mom and had her go pick him up from school and bring him home while i cleaned her up. I met him outside and told him. I asked if he wanted to see her or not and of course he did so I brought him in and we laid on the floor with her for almost 2 hours. Petting her, crying and talking about all the ways she was such an awesome cat. The other animals came and went multiple times to check on her. He started to get upset at first when the dogs got close to her but i just explained they were just as confused as the other cats and needed to say good bye too. He understood and after he felt everyone had processed that she was gone was he willing to then let me take her away.  In the end he was cry smiling and ok with things because he saw her at peace and got to say everything he ever imagined to her. 

 I can't even begin to imagine the emotions of coming home to that news like you did. 

So here's an internet stranger mom hug to you for coming home to that bullshit ‚ô° I would've pulled you out to say goodbye to your best friend.

TL:dr - found my sons cat dead one morning. Wasn't an asshole parent and pulled him out of school to say goodbye to his best friend animal buddy.
