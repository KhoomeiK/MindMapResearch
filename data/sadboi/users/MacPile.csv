SuicideWatch,ext5y85,t3_cubxv2,1566563303.0,"There is always somebody that cares about your life. Sometimes people just get busy with their own life and problems/worries that they miss the signs that someone they love and care for is hurting. Once people find out that that person wants to end it, they change their priorities and want you to see how much you mean to them.

Its probably not the same for every situation but either way, I care about your life and I am sure other people do to. If you ever want to talk  I'm here."
