This reminds me of another post where OP said her parents took away most of her clothes, and she didn't want them back so it nullified the punishment somewhat.

We play lots of Minecraft, Halo, Apex, COD, PUBG, Starcraft, Heroes of the storm, and many other similar games.  I have every home console and will stream whatever I'm playing.  I'm looking forward to streaming more Nintendo stuff in the near future as well.

Find me on XBL, PSN, Steam, FB, Mixer, Twitch, Youtube, Twitter, Instagram, tumblr, reddit, and more.  Look for the big green R!"

AmItheAsshole,f5walap,t1_f2lcvxr,1572519063.0,"Dude go have a look at my reply to OP, its all over the damn place.  Especially this year.  You're right on seriously all accounts.  Thats right ALL OF THEM.  Mormons will do everything and anything to hold on to their beliefs. The duality is not something you can reconcile, yet they do it anyway as they are taught to turn it off until a later time, when it inevitably pops out and out of their control. They attempt to throw out the things that are supposedly no longer doctrine in a pattern that can only be described as stunts to save their public image as an organization.

 I mean Just this year they made a big stink of Mormon suddenly being, ""a victory for satan"" when used to describe the church.  They literally spent millions under the previous leader for a campaign to help people understand the term mormon, and to destigmatize the term from rumors. [Mormon.org](https://Mormon.org) was overhauled, members were encouraged to spread messages about meeting the mormons and so on and so forth.  Then the new guy literally shits all over that, and every previous prophet that made fun of the idea of being offended at the name mormon cuz it was clearly here to stay to describe them. (thats why the link goes somewhere else now)

Then there's the whole thing about their treatment of the LGBTQ community, and their recent policy changes on baptisms for children of gay families.  Well was God wrong about gays in 2016 when you first made the policy, or now when you repealed it 3 years later?  Because it looks suspiciously like a PR stunt that failed rather than any revelation or anything else.  

It doesn't matter to them what anyone said in the past, because what the current prophet says, NOW, tends to override everything else.  They'll applaud Brigham young for... something, then gloss over some of his insane racist comments, and his Adam-God doctrine and other fun ideas.  They used to have these ads called mormonads that were little spiritual messages. There was one with a cockroach in icecream I especially remember.  ""It's great, except for the bad parts""  It was a point about adult media being harmful, but ironically they do the same thing to cherry pick their own history.  Which makes it that much funnier that you mention them throwing out the racist bits of the book of mormon, despite how they claim that its the truest book ever written.  

So yes, the duality is there.  Contradictions are common place all throughout their theology.  But they'll ignore anything and everything that doesn't suit the narrative.  As the book of mormon musical says- Just turn it off!

\-check out r/exmormon for even more,  [cesletter.org](https://cesletter.org/) is another amazing resource.

TL;DR - Mormons live with the contradictions and nasty parts of their religion through mental gymnastics and denial, they'll take whatever angle supports their ideals, and will throw previous prophets under the bus if what they said doesn't suit the narrative."
AmItheAsshole,f5w8rla,t3_ddp912,1572517547.0,"NTA Mormonism is ALOT of strange things in plain sight, but only to those outside.  I shit you not I literally saw a post on FB today saying ""If your religion makes you hate a demographic (gays)  its time to not be a part of it.  And a mormon kid I know commented ""Glad mine doesn't""!  There are conflicting beliefs all throughout the religion, and what they actually believe is so hard to follow.  Depending on who you ask and the context, they either do or don't beleive in polygamy in the afterlife, they either do or don't believe in racist things, and the list goes on.   

What you're really saying is that you don't want to associate with someone who makes excuses for awful, reprehensible behavior.  (and it's important to note that not all mormons are like this by default, but he openly admitted to it by saying that brown people come from a bad history)  Racism is quite literally only the tip of that iceberg, and it's better to just not try to go near it.  Or not. Why not invite him back over and ask him what Brigham Young said about inter- race marriages?
