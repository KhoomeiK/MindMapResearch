starbucks,f480i34,t3_djgepi,1571430775.0,"Congrats!

I can relate to this in so many ways! Long story short Im from Canada and I moved to California to be with my now husband of 3 years (together for almost 7!).

Back at home our version of a 'coffee shop' was Tim Hortons. It was my first job and it sucked. I'd looked up a lot about Starbucks and just knew I wanted to work there when I moved. 

I moved, applied and was hired by an amazing woman. I told my story to her and I could tell she was moved by it. I started and it was a little hard at first but my first team was so patient and kind to me. I miss them all.

Some fucked up shit happened in my life so I had to move. Only being there for 5 months my manager told me she was sad I was transfering because she was a few months away to promoting me to shift. 

Transfered and had to prove myself to a new team. It was hard but I really stood my ground with my new team and grew everyday. About six months later and I was promoted. 

It was a huge step for me but damn did I ever grow. I helped change our store for the better in a year and we continue to become stronger. 

Starbucks is awesome."
