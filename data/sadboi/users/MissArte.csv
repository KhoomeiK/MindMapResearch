Dogtraining,fqzwykk,t3_glusb8,1589777480.0,"Please visit r/service_dogs. They can help you much much more than this sub can. You likely won't get the answers you want, but they really know what they're talking about over there. 

It is very unlikely to be able to train an adult dog to handle being a service dog. The training involves so much more than just obedience. To be able to handle being in unpredictable, even scary, daily situations in public, puppies are trained and socialized from even 8-12 weeks onward. When a dog doesn't experience such difficult situations as a puppy, the dog is very likely to have a more difficult time coping and handling the high stress. 

You won't be skipping any expenses this way. Service dogs are upwards of $5,000-10,000 and sometimes more whether you purchase a dog from a program or owner-train. Most non-profit organizations don't provide PSDs free of charge to non-veterans. Owner-training is not on-your-own training. You will need the assistance of a professional which will be costly. 

The r/service_dogs sub will cover much more. I hope this helps.

Edit: if you want a ""failed"" (washed-out) service dog to be a service dog for you... that's just not how that works. I'm sorry if that comes off as rude. Dogs are washed for behavioral or medical reasons which make them unsuitable for service work. You can't return them to it. 

If you simply want an ESA, they require no training, but they are NOT allowed public access. Please read this article in conjunction with visiting and posting in the service_dogs sub. https://www.ada.gov/regs2010/service_animal_qa.html <-- this is the federal LAW if you are in the USA."
dogs,fqxxcam,t3_glk5gm,1589739281.0,"If you always give her food filled toys, she will expect them. Maybe wean them out a bit. Get a tug toy like the JW rings (I hope that's the right brand). Put the one end in her mouth, then click or ""yes!"" and give her a treat. She'll soon grab the ring on her own to get a treat. Start putting a word to it like ""take it"" when she goes to grab it. Always click/yes! and treat for touching the ring. You can add a ""wait"" before you say ""take it"" so she doesn't lunge for it (my pup does lunge so I make him wait, but yours may not). This is basically going to teach her that toys are fun. Once she understands ""take it"" you can tug lightly and praise her for holding onto the toy (teach a command like ""drop it"" for her to let go of a tug toy. It's important your dog knows drop it before playing tug). Wean off the clicks and treats and just let the fun of the game be the reward. 

This might not work if your dog truly dislikes toys. What I've found is that lots of dogs just have to be taught how to play and then they enjoy it. It sounds like your pup plays for the food, but not for the game. I think you can encorporate the food into teaching that play is fun without food being all of the fun. I hope this makes sense."

I don't understand how people can think that a tiny strip of material is enough to keep an entire dog's mouth shut. Wow.... people."
service_dogs,fqhr14g,t3_gj0l3x,1589382665.0,"I'm going to offer a bit more advice than you asked for, but it all matters and is relevant to your question.

First, making you feel safe is not a task under the ADA (assuming you are in the USA) and does not make a dog a service animal. This would fall under the ""comfort"" umbrella. The dog will need to be trained a task that directly mitigates your disability to be a service dog. Unfortunately, comfort animals (ESAs) are not allowed into public places; they are just pets. 

Two: no matter WHAT breed you have, people will approach you and want to pet and love it. You could have a scary bully breed (I do not recommend) and there would still be dozens of people who absolutely love the breed and would come up to pet and bother you. Having a ""scary"" breed is more likely to cause access issues than it is to have people avoid you in general. 

Three: Dobermans are not recommended for service work as they are simply not the most suited breed for the job. Since wash-out rates are already so high for owner-trainers, it's not worth getting a breed that isn't super likely to make it. GSDs, on the other hand, are not recommended for psychiatric work because of their drive to protect. If you are having a panic attack, a GSD is more likely to use their instinct to protect and possibly growl at or attack someone who may approach you to check on you. That's not safe behavior, and of course, it's not with every GSD, but since it's a possibility, it's not worth the risk. 

Four: whether you get a dog through a program or owner-train, you can expect to spend upwards of $10,000 or more. The difference is that owner-training costs are more spread out, while program dogs' price is all up front. Unless you have combat-related PTSD, there aren't any ADI accredited programs I know of that are nonprofit and free of charge for their dogs.

Five: the best you could do for breed is look for a black lab. Labs are incredible for SD work and PSD work. Blacks are also somewhat more ""avoided"" than yellows especially because they don't look as friendly and bright. However, like I said before, any dog will bring you loads of attention, especially when you're training it as a puppy in public. Ultimately, if you can't handle being approached at minimum once per outing because of your dog, a PSD may not be right for you. More often than not, PSDs cause more/worsening symptoms especially regarding anxiety. Consider this at length."
dogs,fqfvqus,t1_fqfutk8,1589332651.0,"Thank you for your more experienced input on the breeds. I did know about the chase instinct, but obviously not to kill. It's the chase factor that may happen in the first few weeks that really worries me. With a cat who already doesn't know dogs to have even the smallest bad interaction... they don't seem to forget. It's just not great for the cat at all."
dogs,fqf3rpe,t3_gik6db,1589318227.0,"So this probably isn't the answer you want, but I suggest getting another cat. A lot of your preferences are conflicting; for example, you want a cuddly dog, but you want the dog to be self sufficient and NOT needy. Usually a dog who wants to cuddle is called a ""Velcro"" dog and are often quite dependent and eager to please. The more self-sufficient cat-like dog breeds don't really care for cuddling at all. 

You also want a smaller breed that isn't highly prey driven, which already narrows down the playing field. Beagles and other hounds are extremely highly prey driven - I don't know where you heard that they are generally good with cats, but they are not. 

You also say you are happy to train a dog with the extra time you have working from home, but you also expect the dog to come into your home housetrained, ignoring the cat, perfectly calm, able to be off leash, etc. Unfortunately, most of those behaviors are not what you'll find naturally in a rescue dog or a puppy from a breeder. These traits must be trained, and it's not easy. 

Your cat has never shared a home with a dog. She will likely be very afraid (I have personal experience here) and may never warm up to the dog's presence. My personal cat (7yrs) has been around dogs for now over a year and she still doesn't like them. Your cat is even older which makes her even more likely to dislike a dog. This is something to take into serious consideration. Maybe have a friend's dog over for a day to see how she would react, assuming the dog is well behaved and wouldn't chase or bother the cat. 


So obviously you aren't going to like the answer of ""get another cat"" so I'll advise you with breeds as you asked. Avoid all terriers and hounds. They have the natural instinct to chase small animals, including cats. Even with training, it's a risk that the instinct may kick in when the dog sees a small creature skirting by. I have experience here and it isn't pleasant. Even a small dog can accidentally maim or kill another small animal. You'll want a milder tempered small breed, but any that don't require regular, honestly difficult grooming aren't coming to mind. 

I think if you look for a dog, you should look for specific traits in a dog, rather than the breed itself. There are bigger and smaller dogs with different life experiences and temperaments that may mix into what you're looking for, but I can't say there's a specific breed that fits exactly what you want. If you would be open to larger breeds and perhaps more grooming needs, I'd have more options. Sorry that this isn't really what you wanted to hear."

service_dogs,fqa9eqw,t3_gevjkd,1589215158.0,"I feel like no one answered your question very well. People generally do not like to recommend PSDs because there is a high risk for you to become very dependent on your dog. You don't have to defend yourself to me here because there's really no way for you to know if you'd be dependent or not until you live every day with a dog. The reality is that dogs are the most unreliable medical equipment, despite being the most versatile. They get sick, wash out, have off-days where they are complete jerks, because they are living, breathing animals. You can't always count on an SD to join you everywhere for the reasons above or maybe the place you're going isn't appropriate for a SD, like a loud rock and roll concert. You'll have to worry about where to leave your SD in situations like these.

SDs also cost tens of thousands of dollars whether you go through a program or owner-train. There are extremely few, and likely no ADI accredited, programs who provide PSDs for conditions like yours free of charge. It's not as simple as it looks to just get a dog and train it.

Also, yes your condition is chronic, but do you see yourself having the exact same needs in the next ten years? SDs are long-term and it isn't fair to retire them early because you don't benefit from their help anymore due to a new medication you're trying. 

Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, you're afraid of people coming up behind you. While a dog may be a buffer and block behind you, people will come up behind you just to pet the dog. Consider how scary it might be for you to turn around and see someone leaning over your dog. I don't know exactly how bad of an experience this would be for you, but I do not share your condition and would be pretty startled. Will this happen daily? Probably not, but it is a possibility. PSDs can easily make mental health worse. 

Just some things to consider that articles promoting PSD use often don't cover."

All of these reasons sound simple to fix and usually they are, but these pertain to dogs who just cannot get over their problems like reactivity, fear, or housetraining issues. 60% of dogs at my organization (a top, industry-leading org) wash out for one of the above reasons or otherwise.

No, I would not agree that training a dog to look ""scary"" or have a protective stance would be considered a task under the ADA. That is not something that directly mitigates a handler's disability, like guiding a blind individual would or retrieving dropped items for a person who cannot bend over.

Also, no, even if that was a task, the costs would still be high and the time for training involved would be just as demanding as any other service animal. I'll explain a bit more of the training process so this makes more sense. There are basically three ""phases"" of training, which can overlap, but still take about two years to complete in total. They are: basic obedience, public access, and task training. All service dogs must know general commands like sit, stay, come, and heel. Many also know more advanced commands, like how to go under a table in a restaurant or under a chair on a bus to take up as little room as possible. This goes hand-in-hand with public access training, which involves training the dog to handle any strange, loud, or scary thing that could happen in public. Walking the streets of downtown, where horns are honking and crowds are crossing streets and sidewalks, then there's a pet dog over there barking at a bird -- a service dog is trained to ignore all of it and stay focused on its job. This takes a lot of conditioning, time, and effort. Focusing on the job is where public access training overlaps with task training. Just because a dog can be trained to perform a task in the quietness of home doesn't mean he can easily focus to perform the task in the middle of a busy shopping mall. 

In short, there is so much more than meets the eye when it comes to training a dog to handle being in busy public places - this is why it's so important that untrained pets stay home. ""Untrained"" here isn't meant to be an insulting term, it only means that the most exciting thing the pet dog has likely encountered is a walk through the neighborhood. That just isn't enough experience to handle Walmart or the mall. 

So, even a dog who would be trained to guard/protect as you describe would still need to go through basic and advanced obedience, as well as public access training, all of which a professional trainer is needed to assist. The costs would remain the same for the most part. Sorry for the long answer again, but I wanted to make sure I touched on all of the details enough to answer your question thoroughly."
entitledparents,fpwpnck,t1_fpwmies,1588967678.0,"In the USA, there are NO certifications required by law. You'll find online websites that claim to give you certification and equipment, but they are scams. A service animal is defined as: “a dog that has been individually trained to do work or perform tasks for an individual with a disability.  The task(s) performed by the dog must be directly related to the person's disability,” under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), which is federal USA law. Taking an untrained pet into a public place is automatically representing the dog as a service animal, which is punishable by fines and jail time in many states. Service dogs undergo hundreds of hours of training from even eight weeks old over the course of about two years. Even the best service dog organizations in the industry have about 40% success rates. For owner-trainers, this success rate is even lower. Rescue dogs can make it as service dogs but have a much higher chance of what we call ""washing out"" which means the dog just isn't capable of the job and/or doesn't want to work and should just be a pet. This is why it is highly recommended to purchase a puppy from successful breeding lines, which can be upwards of $1,000-2,000 off the bat. Then, of course, the training. Owner-training does not mean on-your-own training. Owner trainers who are not already professional trainers will require the assistance of professional trainers, which can be up to or more than $5,000 by the end of the dog's training. The general cost of owning a dog, including food, grooming, and vet bills, can add up to several thousand dollars annually. 

This is already around $10,000 in total. Now factoring in the high rate of attacks that service dogs endure from illegally admitted pets inside non-pet friendly establishments. Just one, even minor attack can cause a perfectly good dog’s career to end. Then, after the heartache the handler goes through, the process of another puppy will start again, costing another $10,000. 

This is less concerning your original question, but I wanted to go on from there: please, do not purchase certifications to bypass the years of training true service animals require. Diagnosis does not equal disability, and many disabilities do not pose a need for a service animal. A person with emotional difficulties may benefit from what is recognized in the USA as an emotional support animal (ESA), but animals that provide comfort are NOT protected under the ADA. ESAs are granted free housing under the fair housing act (FHA) and are allowed free cabin travel in airplanes according to the ACAA. This does not mean you can bring Fifi into Walmart with you for your comfort or support. As stated before, the ADA explains a service animal must be task trained to mitigate a disability, and that comfort is not a trained task. 

If you see a working service animal, please ignore the dog. Do not take pictures to show your friend, do not touch the dog, and do not tell the dog how good he is and how much you wish you could pet him. If you must say anything, please address the handler to tell them how good their dog is, but do not address the dog. Service dogs have a very important job to do, and like you wouldn’t want to be interrupted at school or work, they don’t want to be distracted either. 

Thank you for reading, and I am happy to answer any questions.

entitledparents,fpwjupo,t1_fpwe8za,1588964721.0,"Hey, just to let you know, if you did have a need that a service dog could fill, you are just as deserving of one as anyone else. If you want to tuck it away for a later time, should you change your mind about needing one, I suggest the non-profit Canine Companions for Independence. They are leading in the industry for wheelchair and hearing dogs. They can open doors for you, pick up things you've dropped, even pull your chair for short distances, pull laundry out of the dryer for you, and other great tasks. Of course, it's up to you if you could even use help in these areas, but I know there are many people who hugely benefit from just those simple tasks. The best part is that the organization provides the dogs completely free of charge. I'm also open to chat about the topic if you're ever interested."
entitledparents,fpwj3xl,t1_fpwf1el,1588964348.0,"Unfortunately, in the USA owner training is nearly as expensive or even more expensive than a program dog. The difference is slow, over-time spending rather than lump sums up front."

service_dogs,fpp1i83,t1_fpotoim,1588794324.0,"So how puppy raisers work: organizations who train dogs... have to task train the dogs, yes, but dogs aren't ready for task training until they're adults. Well, what are you going to do with the puppies until they can be task trained? Puppy raisers! Puppy raisers receive puppies from organizations at about 8-12 weeks old, depending on what the organization's policies are. I received my current puppy at 10 weeks old. Raisers are volunteers and are guided by basically ""expert"" volunteers or other trainers, often in groups of many raisers based on region. Most orgs have puppies in raiser homes until they are about 15-20 months old. Then they go back to the organization to be task trained and paired with clients. I personally volunteer puppy raise for a guide dog organization. Clients of organizations like mine don't get dogs directly from puppy raisers, but we are a huge step in the process of their training. I hope this answers your question!

Also, I know Disney World does provide crates for service dogs while their handlers ride, but not all amusement parks provide these. As a raiser, I am not allowed to leave my puppy with anyone not approved by the organization, but you'd be able to leave your personal dog with whomever you trust. Otherwise, leaving your dog home is totally okay to do!"

Nails,fpoj032,t3_geo4lh,1588785307.0,That's pretty much what I do. I don't usually have the time for all the extra stuff. I do like to buff my nails though.
dogs,fpoiva9,t1_fpoh2vj,1588785243.0,"I suggest looking into getting an adult dog instead. I imagine your time frame is open for a puppy right now due to the pandemic, but I wouldn't suggest this route. When work goes back to normal and you must give the puppy back, you and the puppy will be heartbroken. The puppies are 3mo old now and will only be 6mo old then. There isn't any way you'd be able to keep a puppy that young if you work 8hrs in a day or longer. However, adult dogs are usually able to hold their bladders for longer and generally don't require loads of attention throughout the day the same as puppies do. You could probably research and consider adopting an adult dog, bonding over the next few months while slowly introducing your schedule, and be able to keep the dog. However, if you work longer than 8hrs, it's not going to be very fair to even an adult dog.

Alternatively to all of this, consider volunteer fostering for your local shelter or rescue. This IS a temporary position, where you aren't required to keep the dog, nor do you go into it with the mindset of keeping whatever dog you foster in the first place. Fostering is great and is a great thing to do when everyone is at home anyway.

It's up to you, obviously, but I don't recommend getting a puppy just to give it back in the blink of an eye."
service_dogs,fpoiays,t3_gemr12,1588784976.0,"So for me, it's like having a toddler glued to your side all of the time. Especially since I perpetually am training puppies as a puppy raiser. If I want to take even a small day trip, I have to plan when I will be home and if I should take his dinner with me. I have to make sure I have refilled my poo bags on my treat pouch. I have to be sure to grab his travel bowl and enough water for the trip, especially if we are outside. I grab a second leash, should anything happen to my preferred. Boots, if the weather requires it. I have to be certain he is brushed and not dropping fur everywhere. I have to remember his potty schedule and not risk an accident. I have to plan what I want to do around what he can do - I can't go to an amusement park with him and ride any rides, as I can't leave him with anyone else and I am not allowed to bring him on. I would have to plan another raiser to care for him for the day instead.

There is just a lot of responsibility in owning or training service dogs by itself. Especially in the current pandemic, my responsibilities as a puppy raiser have become much more difficult. Normally, I would meet with my group of puppy raisers multiple times monthly to work on training and evaluate progress, but now we must do it over Zoom and other online options. Obviously this isn't an issue for people with fully trained SDs, but I imagine meeting with trainers when you're owner training must be just as difficult as what I am facing."
service_dogs,fpohmnh,t1_fpofly5,1588784647.0,This isn't what OP asked...
LongDistance,fpogirz,t3_genhw2,1588784108.0,"This is going to sound like I'm talking down to you, but that is not my intention. You're only 16. You have so much time ahead of you to establish good relationships. If you lose this bf now, it won't hurt your future in the slightest. When young people are ages 15-20 is when the most changes will happen to their personality. This is because this is the time when young people really find who they are apart from their parents. The boy you know now could be someone extremely different from the person he will be when he's 18 or 20. And so will you. 

Being diagnosed young with disorders like BPD I believe is often harmful. Bipolar tendencies, depression, and anxiety is normal at your age range and will clear up as you get older, closer to 20-25. Don't worry about anyone being able to ""handle"" your issues, as they'll likely lessen as you get older. If he doesn't like who you are, he doesn't have to. Accept yourself and don't worry about others accepting you."
dogs,fpofznj,t3_geni2i,1588783856.0,"Yes, the puppy would be able to adjust. But why would you do this?"
service_dogs,fpo3i1b,t1_fpo0b8z,1588777714.0,"Aha! Okay, so no there aren't any concrete rules or laws on this specifically, as you know.

Your dog will tell you when he's too tired to work. Especially if you begin training a puppy, discretion should be heavily used to know when your puppy is tired and needs a break. A fully trained, adult dog should not be asked to work more than eight hours at a time. As many breaks as possible should be given. Some dogs can work longer, some dogs can't work that long. It really depends on the dog. Regardless of ability, dogs are living creatures who need water breaks every two hours, potty breaks almost that often, and time for a general breather. Once you have your dog, it's easier to really understand how to communicate with your dog about these things."
