ShingekiNoKyojin,fqcq5fq,t1_fq9gqkl,1589265336.0,"Ah, looking back feels amazing but experiencing for the first time? Frustrating. This world is both cruel and beautiful. With Eren’s fight with the female titan, you don’t know why she’s fighting to capture him, what’s motivating her (the sake of the humans living outside) which leaves the fight feeling empty. What’s at stake anyway?

Yams uses the omission of information to give the readers thrill after thrill when they uncover the layers of the story. It serves to motivate the reader to continue (what’s in the basement) but also inadvertently discourages them (lack of investment in characters due to unwinable war). I felt this the first time I watched it in the trost arc. I just turned my emotions off easily so I didn’t have to feel the pain of the throwaway characters dying. But those stupid deaths lead to eren discovering he had the Titan powers which lead to unforeseen victory when you expected defeat like wall Maria. 

That’s the story’s beauty, all that happens is more information is revealed that was predictable all along, and it’s so much more satisfying. Fighting titans with another Titan works better than fighting then with ODM gear. Oh what did we just happen to see, the attack Titan taking care of buisness. Then the information is revealed that eren can control it and we have thrilling hope. I think readers like to explore and discover, not be handed information.


I hope this gets repeated with the finale. We are in a hopeless situation rn, how do you find the best solution to the ongoing Titan war? You can’t, because it’s impossible without someone dying. But we know we’re missing information with POV. Does it contain blazing hope?"

With this info your theory still holds true.

I do not know if Reiner will ever die lol, I bet it'll probably be related to Eren in some way though. Oh wait, Reiner has already protected Falco in the attack on Libero before he became the Jaw Titan.

Maybe Falco will save Reiner in some way, does the suicide attempt count where he knocked on the wall of the room Reiner was in with a shotgun?"

This goes into season 4 towards the end, be careful.

Also, valid. I don't remember but I probably felt the same thing when I first watched it. Also Fairytail was my first anime too, and its blursed (can't believe I used to binge it). I think that's why I liked this anime so much because it was in contrast to it at the time. I binged season 1-2 straight through because I was too scared to fall asleep. 

I got fed up with AoT at times, but I'm caught up with season 4 in the manga and I'm so glad cause without spoiling anything lets just say I'm addicted to it. 

When I first watched it, one thing I regretted was that I was afraid to get attached to characters cause I knew they were gonna die and didn't want to be heartbroken, but that's a lot of the beauty of the story. Go back and reread/rewatch stuff cause its worth it to remember the characters so that your reactions are more intense at the time. 

The second time I would read something through, it would hit harder because I knew information about the future, but also I remembered stuff that I had forgotten before I read it.

attackontitan,fo5un3m,t3_g53iy3,1587536235.0,"\#1 I answered below

\#2 I have no idea if the fakes were employed, but I'd assume it's the Reiss's that were stopping technology advancements due to believing in the founding titan's divine right to rule. Every time the Founding Titan was passed down to a member of the royal family, they were brainwashed by the first king of the walls Fritz's ideals. King Fritz believed in pacifism, so that's why he got ""everyone"" to retreat behind the walls. He then wiped their memory so that they didn't know there were other people outside the wall.

If Armin's parents escaped on the hot air balloon, that would bust the secret.

Since Eren received the founding Titan from Grisha and he was not a royal, he could use its powers as he pleased without the influence of the first kings ideals. The Reiss's believed this was dangerous af since their ancestors and king fritz must have known something that everyone else didn't, using that info to keep everyone safe. By Eren having the founding Titan, everyone inside the walls is fucked; they don't know why because they don't know the secret, but they don't want to find out. 

\#3 Zeke and Eren are symbolic opposites, Eren is his own side. Eren pretends to be on Zeke's side so can use the coordinate via Zeke. Zeke believes the solution to the Titan's violence is to slowly kill the gene by making everyone who has it infertile, fucking over any remaining Eldians when the become old people who need to be taken care of. 

Eren, however, believes he has a right to freedom because he was born into this world. And he's doin what it takes to achieve it. All of Paradis is on Eren's side because it is most beneficial to them; up until a few years ago there was no outside world for them."

I don’t care whether Eren’s an asshole or not, I just want to know the truth, and my hunch says what we see is wrong. 

Wouldn’t it be crazy if we got a happy ending? This series has been hell and depressing to watch, wouldn’t it be cathartic to just have all the problems resolve and go to peace? And unexpected of a series like this. Nothing ever goes right. 

Feel free to share your thoughts on whether you think completing the rumbling is Eren’s plan or not.
