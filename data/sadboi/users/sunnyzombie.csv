BodyAcceptance,fhh6twc,t3_f378rl,1581595897.0,"The first thing that helped me with my BDD is not looking into mirrors unless I absolutely had to and I wouldn't look at myself in pictures. This thing where everyone takes pics of themselves and then reviewing them is not healthy. The focus is on what you look like, not being with your friends or experiencing life as it happens.

I never got into body positivity but body neutrality helped me tremendously. I don't have to go around saying I have a hot bod and I love it, instead I focus on what my body can do. It is liberating not to think about your body and/or face at all. 

It takes time but it is worth the work. This book Beyond Beautiful by Anuschka Rees is excellent. And if you google Body Neutrality, there is a lot of information now about it. And definitely see your therapist when your appt comes up. If you don't like them or feel they don't ""get it"", find another. There are lots of excellent therapists out there and you will find the right one for you. Good luck."

Witches,f9frank,t3_e4nm13,1575283795.0,"For literature, try Lolly Willowes by Sylvia Townsend Warner. Single woman in the 1920s struggling to break free of her controlling family, moves to a small odd town and discovers she's a witch. I can't begin to do the plot justice.

It's a brilliant piece of classic feminist lit and highly entertaining. One of my favorite books ever."
BodyAcceptance,f9bvjc9,t3_e4dh1y,1575216728.0,"Without question, the hardest part of my ED recovery was the shame of gaining weight and feeling like ""I let everyone down"". I have family I see only at the holidays and I see their eyes drift down to my midsection and I imagine all sorts of horrible thoughts going through their heads. I used to get all kinds of compliments about my clothing and looks - now there is nothing. I know I look relatively fine, but it still hurts because I was conditioned to think that was the most important thing about me.

Honestly, I wish I had never been thin. I hate that people have this memory of cute, thin me and they compare that image to the woman who is 25 years older and 45 pounds heavier. I would rather they just remember me as funny and interesting to talk to and that my looks were never relevant. It totally sucks.

Anyways, I think once you can get over that embarrassment of weight gain and your imaginary thoughts of what people are thinking, you have won half the battle. It's really hard though. Please remember that it is your body and you don't owe pretty and thin to ANYONE."

EDs can be as deadly as some terminal illnesses and God knows we suffer with them for years and years and years. I don't want anyone to set me off again.

However, sometimes just saying ""I don't participate in Diet Culture. It's a tool of the patriarchy and I am a woman of the future"" is a good way to shut them down too. I mean, what response are you going to give to THAT? Lol"
fuckeatingdisorders,f8iem7j,t1_f8emgc6,1574587801.0,The best way to handle it is the way that works best for YOU. Blocking out their voices is fine as long as you aren't internalizing their comments. It took a very long time for me to become comfortable with speaking out and just ignoring their old-fashioned nonsense is absolutely fine!
fuckeatingdisorders,f886z5h,t3_dzjgh4,1574349650.0,"I say this all the time but please find a therapist. I am also older and it is difficult to find ED specialists that treat older women, but any good therapist or psychologist can help you too. 

I think if you are at a point where you feel like you have no control over your thoughts and the ED, then it is time for some professional help. I know this is not true of everybody, but for me, my ED and self-loathing were directly related to other issues in my life and the ED was the one thing I had ""control"" (haha) over. Once I began dealing with my other issues, I was able to confront my anorexia and begin recovery.

It's not a pipe dream but it is hard work and takes time and it is painful to work through some of the underlying causes. But the world on the other side of ED is beautiful and worth the fight."
fuckeatingdisorders,f86xf15,t1_f86gd8v,1574309371.0,"Honestly, it's not so much body positivity as it is body neutrality. That works much better for me. I see other women of all sizes as being beautiful but it's really difficult to see it in myself. So I choose to focus on what my body can do and how well it functions. That's body neutrality. The book Beyond Beautiful is really good reading on the subject. 

And quite frankly, therapy has been a huge help to me. I had a lot of brainwashing to undo. I needed to see that just because I am a woman doesn't mean I owe the world beauty and perfection and thinness. It's such a short life; I don't want to waste anymore time on what other people think is important.

ETA: I wanted to add that a big key for me was getting past the embarrassment of gaining weight. I can't begin to tell you how hard that was for me. I was mortified to run into people I hadn't seen in a while and know they were thinking ""good lord she let herself go!!"". I had to develop internal validation and not care how others saw me. It's ridiculous that I was more upset about how other people saw me than how I saw myself. I was brought up to believe the more valuable thing about me was my appearance and once I was no longer the hottest girl in the room, what did I have to offer? Well, as it turns out, plenty, and my looks were the very least of my assets. 

I think the biggest key is learning to love yourself - not your looks, your body or any of the outside stuff, but your inside - your soul and your spirit and the essence of you. Find out what makes you special and happy and interesting and build on that. Once you love yourself inside, NOBODY including your ED can make you feel shitty about yourself again. Hope this helps - you can always PM me if you want to talk."

I have confronted my parents on numerous occasions and they still don't see that they did anything wrong even though both my sister and I were anorexic. I accept that but I refuse to let them make comments about my appearance or anyone else's in my presence. I'm sorry you are dealing with this - it's really emotionally painful, I know."
fuckeatingdisorders,f84tglk,t1_f84jixt,1574260289.0,"Listen, you have a right to be angry. It still makes me mad to think of all the time I wasted on my weight obsession and for what? A series of worthless boyfriends/casual flings who were really only interested in my body and looks? For the validation from others that ""oh, you have such a flat stomach! I'm so jealous!"" I promise you, none of that will be important to you in your life. We have all been sold a lie that being thin is the top achievement in life. We should all be absolutely furious at the loss of time devoted to dieting, endless workouts, etc.

For me, the worst part of recovery was the inevitable weight gain and running into old acquaintances, friends, and boyfriends and seeing the surprise in their face. We are supposed to be ashamed of being anything but physically perfect. Once you get past that shame - once you acknowledge that you have a RIGHT to be mentally healthy and interested in other things besides diet and weight loss - you will be free. I'm not even kidding. Once I could acknowledge that yes, I gained weight, I was able to respond to people in ways that shut down rude ""helpful"" comments. 

For instance: ""Oh you've put on weight since I last saw you!"" Me: ""Yes, thank GOD! I was anorexic and had severe exercise bulimia and I could have DIED from either one of those! I am so lucky! I feel so wonderful now and I don't miss those days of being sick for anything!""  For people who discuss Intermittent Fasting and food fads, etc in front of me and wait for my response, I say ""I spent 40 years on that nonsense. I've got better things to do now"". 

It won't happen overnight, but don't let anyone (including your parents) make you feel bad about yourself. You have a right to be healthy and live a full life the way YOU want to live it. And that's my rant for the day lol. Good luck - you can do this!"
fuckeatingdisorders,f84hpzv,t3_dz08pz,1574249114.0,"Oh God yes, it's the story of my life. Lol My parents have always made comments about me and my sister and we BOTH had raging EDs and for me, BDD. I'm 55 and well past my original treatment, but I recently had to begin therapy again because my aging parents moved in with me. And even when they aren't making comments, I feel judged. I've spoken to them about it, but it's the generation they are from. For a woman, weight gain and letting yourself go is the ultimate crime against humanity. LOL How are all those men gonna enjoy looking at you and hitting on you, etc. if you let yourself go? Ugh.

My advice as someone who has been there, keep going to therapy, WORK HARD because ED and body dysmorphia are incredibly hard to get past, read all you can about body positivity or neutrality, and try to keep a sense of humor about your moms comments. Keep repeating to anyone who persists with comments that you are in therapy for an eating disorder and you would appreciate them not undermining your therapists work. Tell them your body is YOUR business and you dont need helpful comments. Leave the room. You dont have to be polite and listen. 

We are a generation that is trying to turn the tide on this epidemic. Its hard work but worth it. Keep fighting. You deserve a life free from ED."
fuckeatingdisorders,f81yufx,t3_dyioug,1574180350.0,"I never thought I had anorexia until my therapist told me I had atypical anorexia which is basically anorexic symptoms without the skeletal frame. Like you, I am tall and have a ""farm-girl"" frame lol and no matter how little I ate, my body refused to go past a certain point. Which really pissed me off at the time, but now I am so grateful for that. However I look at old pics and see the ""bobble-head"" effect - my head looks way too big for my neck.

Like maryjanewtson says, everyone is different with their EDs, but based on what you are saying, it sounds like an ED to me. I read somewhere once that your ED will try to tell you that you DON'T have an ED, that you are exaggerating and it's just ""healthy living"". Like depression, your eating disorder will lie to you. Don't fall for it."

BodyAcceptance,f6jiv07,t1_f6iwr5h,1572895389.0,"Other than living in the Netherlands, you could be me. lol I am a recovered anorexic who grew up with parents who value beauty and thinness above everything else. Both my sister and I were anorexics and it was hard to overcome the body brainwashing we received. In addition to that, part of my recovery was treating my depression and anxiety and yes, the meds do cause weight gain. But it was such a relief to be (more or less) off the depression/anxiety rollercoaster, it is worth it. So don't stop taking your meds. Also, read anything you can about body neutrality or positivity. Neutrality works best for me. Beyond Beautiful is a fantastic book.

Also, I agree that buying nice clothes that fit is important. Find a style you like and look for things on eBay, Poshmark and thrift stores. You can find awesome deals on very nice clothes. I like palazzo pants and skirts. I hate anything tight-fitting so this style works for me.

You are probably walking a lot now because of where you live, but walking 30 mins a day helps my mindset about my body. It's not for losing weight but for the serotonin boost and joy of moving my body. I just feel better. 

If you need advice about dealing with your family, I'll be glad to help. But please remember that this is YOUR life and YOUR body and their hangups are THEIR problem. My mother is 85 and STILL talks about losing weight and ""shaping up"" and that's been her goal her entire life. How sad is that?"
fuckeatingdisorders,f5eihe9,t1_f5dmet7,1572171083.0,"OMG this is totally me. Ive been in recovery from anorexia, bingeing and exercise bulimia for years and I always wondered why when everything is going well-I'm eating instinctively, I'm exercising appropriately, not thinking about my weight, etc-I somehow go off track. It could be someone commenting on how nice I look or my clothes are looser or whatever; I just totally freak out and start bingeing/skipping meals again or make plans for an even more elaborate workout and then suddenly I'm right back to my crazy thinking.

I always thought maybe it was a defense mechanism like my extra weight is a protection from too much unwanted attention. But now I wonder if it's a self-sabotage. I am definitely guilty of the ""you'll never be good enough"" type of thinking.

I can't do body positive either - it does not work for me. I discovered body neutrality and I have had more success with that. Body neutrality is not loving or hating your body - it's just a body and you don't think about what it looks like. It takes work but it does help."

Just because she looked at you with sympathy doesn't mean she read it. I promise you, she's probably been there herself and felt compassion for you.

And even if she did read it, you should not be embarrassed at all. Be proud that you are dealing with your ED and working hard on recovery. I wish I had started at a younger age. Try not to think about this too much. Keep moving forward and I wish you the very best of luck."
