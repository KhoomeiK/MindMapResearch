CPTSD,fqavliq,t1_fqau4tn,1589226046.0,"Yes, unfortunately mainstream media tends to portray “flight/fight” as a singular moment in which you “decide” what to do and that “determines” who you are as a person. This makes for interesting TV, but it is completely baseless.

When in fight/flight/freeze, you are actually incapable of thinking. The blood rushes away from the prefrontal cortex and toward the muscles. This is to keep you safe. Thinking takes up time and delays our reaction response. A fraction of a second can make the difference between life and death, so the thinking part of the brain turns off and the body acts alone. This is why it’s difficult to “think logically” during a trigger. You literally cannot think.

Your trauma response is never your choice or your fault. It is an automatic, physical response to threat. This is why trauma is stored more in the body than the mind. 

If you tended to “freeze” as a child, when you get triggered now, your body may automatically go into freeze response as a precautionary measure. As you begin to heal, the trigger response may lessen. Instead of immediately dissociating upon trauma-reminders or triggers, you may get angry instead (fight). This is good and a sign of healing, as fight/flight are lower-order stress responses. 

However, fight/flight are controlled by the sympathetic nervous system (whereas freeze is controlled by parasympathetic nervous system), which means instead of feeling nothing and dissociating, you may FEEL much more (heart pounding, hyperventilating). This can feel more intense and can cause people to feel as though they are getting worse (“I used to space out when I was triggered and now I become irritable and want to scream”). In actuality, this is a sign of healing."
CPTSD,fqato39,t3_ggrsy4,1589225094.0,"The “type” of response you have to trauma actually has nothing to do with you, personally. It has to do with the nature of the trauma. 

The first response someone will have to trauma would be “flight.” This provides the greatest likelihood of escaping unharmed.  Unfortunately, in some circumstances, you are unable to run away (you may be cornered physically or be in a situation, like work, where you cannot escape emotional or mental attacks). In this case, you would be forced to fight back. In this instance, you may get hurt, but you can preserve your life by fighting back. Both flight and fight raise heart beat and blood pressure. It’s not a mental state, but a physical state of of the nervous system (the sympathetic nervous system specifically).

There are some circumstances where you cannot run away and fighting would also be dangerous/provoking (for instance, if they were significantly more powerful or had a weapon. Or, if fighting back causes the perpetrator to become more aggressive than before). This is when freeze comes into play. Freeze is actually the parasympathetic nervous system, and it only comes when running away and fighting are not options. Freeze is essentially “playing dead.” The heart rate slows, breathing slows, blood pressure lowers. In freeze (or a state of dissociation), the brain releases natural-made opiates that can numb the body and mind, preparing for near-fatal blows. This is the last-ditch preservation effort.

Think in terms of a bear. If you are walking in the woods and you see a bear, your first instinct is to run away— not to rush forward and tussle. You don’t want to get hurt. Now, running from a bear is a bad idea (they are much faster than you are), so you may try to slowly back away (still a flight response). Your blood is pumping. It’s hard to think. 

Perhaps the bear sees you and begins to follow you. There’s no getting away now. When it lunges for you, you aim for the eyes, mouth, nose, trying to beat the bear back. This may intimidate a black bear (which are smaller), but a brown bear is larger, stronger, and not so afraid of a human. 

If it is a brown bear, you know it is both faster than you and stronger than you. Running away will make the bear see you as food and it will chase and maul you. If you fight the bear, you will enrage it and it will surely kill you. This is where freeze response comes in. You lay flat on the ground. You’re barely breathing, trying not to make a sound. Even in this case, you may still get mauled (the bear may want to make sure you really are dead). You have to remain lifeless even through the pain, hoping the bear will believe you are really dead and leave you alone.

It’s a common misconception that you are a “type” of trauma response. In reality, we ALL use ALL of them depending on the type of threat. If you grew up in an abusive household as a child, you may have some times run away and hid, you may have some times fought back or argued back. Other times, running away or fighting back may “poke the bear,” and in that case your only option may have been to shut down long enough to endure the pain and continue to survive."

Parenting isn’t about “laying down the law” and having “obedient” children. Parenting is about guiding and supporting children in their own personal journey through difficult developmental stages. This must be done with love and affection. Sometimes that requires rules and boundaries, but say yes as often as you can. Only say no when you need to. Correct with love. Give your child a chance to speak and really listen to what they are saying.  

I can’t say exactly what you “should” do. I don’t know you or your family and have not seen these interactions for myself. It sounds as though you are trying hard to be the best parent you can be.  Information is power, and the best thing you can do is become as informed as possible."

depression,fk8f3ib,t3_fgyri0,1583954865.0,"Do not tell him to look on the bright side (good job checking yourself on this one!!)— instead do a little reading on “Toxic Positivity.” There are many phrases like “be positive” that are not at all helpful and can make others feel worse. If you search it up you’ll find many more examples.

Do not give “quick fixes” or really advice in general. As much as you want to help, you’re probably not going to think of something they haven’t thought of already. Consider your friend an expert on his own depression. Telling him to “take a shower” or “go for a walk” or “eat healthier” aren’t actually helpful. He probably already knows what he SHOULD be doing but physically cannot. Depression (and really all “mental” illnesses) are not just in the mind. They have physical symptoms as well (which could be beneficial to look up if you don’t know them already).

Do not compare. Do not compare your issues to his. Do not compare his issues to other people’s issues. Do not compare his progress to others or the amount of time healing is taking. Everyone is different. Let him know it’s okay for him to go at his own pace and that you validate and support him.

INSTEAD

Lend an ear. Just listen. BUT be prepared that some things he says may hurt your feelings because you care about him. Depressive thoughts can be extremely dark, and if you’re not prepared to hear upsetting things, do not present yourself as a willing listener. If you react poorly, it may make you both feel worse.

You shouldn’t GIVE advice, but you can support him in following good advice. Invite him outside of the house. Ask him to go for a walk with you. If he doesn’t have the energy to make a healthy meal, maybe you could make one for the both of you. Then you’re eating something home cooked (which is good for you as well), but he can eat something other than pizza rolls or the chips by his bed.  Maybe on a bad day, don’t expect him to leave the house, but maybe ask if you two could watch a movie together (those with depression tend to self isolate, sometimes without even knowing it).

Point out the good you see in him. Don’t force this one because if it comes off as pity or being disingenuous, it could make you both feel worse. But let him know you like watching movies better when he’s there to crack jokes or even just that you had a good time hanging out with him. It can be this little stuff that reaffirms to him that he matters to someone and that he has good qualities (because he may feel he is worthless or stupid as depression often distorts thinking).

Most of all, I think what you are doing right now is the most important step. Do research. Look into what depression is and what common symptoms are so you can better understand. This can also help familiarize you with the issues so you won’t be likely to be as shocked when you hear it from a friend. If you’re comfortable, see if you can gage where his head is at. If he begins to talk about suicidal thoughts, try not to shy away from the conversation or dismiss it. Allow him to open up and talk if you can. Then encourage him to talk to his doctor (if he hasn’t already). If you believe he is a danger to himself, please contact his family or the police. Suicide is the 10th leading cause of death (way more common than you think)."
CPTSD,fk8c0vp,t1_fk89e4k,1583953238.0,"Everyone has Childhood Amnesia. That is normal. OP definitely has Childhood Amnesia because everyone does. It is apart of child development. Rate of maturation is different for everyone. Some may recall things as early as 5 years old, but it is not at all unusual not to remember things before even the age of 9.

What OP may have that most people don’t have is Dissociative Amnesia. This happens when you dissociate during a traumatic event. The memory is incorrectly processed and can even be repressed for years (or decades!) The memories still exist, but are inaccessible to the conscious mind as the mind’s natural coping mechanism.

For instance, I cannot remember anything before the age of 5. That is Childhood Amnesia. I can remember things from 5-8. I cannot remember anything from 9-12 due to dissociating from trauma. That is Dissociative Amnesia.

I was not saying OP doesn’t have Dissociative Amnesia, but I was correcting you because you seemed to have misused the term “Childhood Amnesia,” which, in fact, everyone has and is normal."

That’s when memories I KNEW had happened “came back.” In a way, they were always there, but it was as if my mind had built a wall in front of them so I could not access them.

I think this relates to the saying “you can’t heal in the same place that made you sick.” Your mind has to feel safe for a long enough period to begin to access the overwhelming memories. 

Once I moved out of my parents’ house, I thought I was fine because I was no longer in the abusive situation. After about a year, I began to have flashbacks to memories I hadn’t thought about since they happened. My mind had put the memories out of reach until a time when I was safe enough to sort through them and begin the real healing process.

As for Ma “unlying,” I believe this was done more for Jack’s safety. As he is beginning to make sense of the world, he begins to interact with Old Nick unlike he’s done before. Ma needs Jack to know how dangerous Old Nick is to keep Jack from putting them both in danger (like with the toy car or when Jack wants to accept presents from Old Nick). Although Ma would like to maintain his innocence, she has to expose him to the dangers to keep him safe.

At the end, Jack begins to realize that Old Nick could kill them, or at least make them die. It doesn’t seem the thought is allowed to fully be realized, not only because it gets cut off, but because Jack seems in a bit of denial or lack of understanding as Ma very plainly describes the complicated situation.

Still, that knowledge doesn’t alleviate the internalized feeling of shame and fundamental “badness.” Were you, by chance, gaslighted quite a bit as a child? Long term side effects of gaslighting can cause you to constantly doubt your own perceptions. Narcissists will use this especially when they try to convince the victim that they (the victim) are actually the abuser themselves. 

I was severely gaslighted as a child, and my connection and perception of reality are extremely damaged.

In 1984, Winston is physically and emotionally neglected and abused by Big Brother and, more directly, O’Brian. His mindset throughout the book is that of a trauma survivor enduring abuse.

For books, I would first recommend The Boy Who Was Raised As A Dog by Bruce D. Perry. Be warned, it can be very intense. At times the description is quite detailed and not everyone is able to finish it for that reason.

More in the child psychology realm, Self Reg by Stuart Shanker explores the affect of stress on the brain that disrupts ability to develop and function.

On Reddit, you could visit r/CPTSD (chronic, interpersonal trauma) where survivors of abuse discuss their stories and daily struggles. You could also go to r/Exmormon. When George Orwell relates 1984’s Ingsoc to the Catholic Church, he is exploring the affects of spiritual abuse. This is heavily discussed on r/ExMormon (sometimes specifically discussing 1984).

1984 contains beautiful political commentary, but the symbolism runs deep into PTSD, abuse (physical and very much psychological), and spiritual manipulation and control."

In regards to abuse, you are actually incorrect. In fact, the majority of abusers were abuse victims. That’s why breaking the cycle can be such a huge struggle. Some of those who go through abuse internalize these bad behaviors (even seeing them as normal) and begin to perpetuate the behaviors themselves. 

Some people even experience such horrendous abuse that they become numb to their own feelings and can no longer experience empathy or compassion for others. O’Brian symbolically represents the abuser.  Over time, Winston actually both hates O’Brian and his representation of Big Brother, but he also loves him and has hope in him as he did Goldstein and The Brotherhood (as in the Two Minutes Hate Goldstein and Big Brother meld into each other because they are two sides of the same coin). In the end, the abuse actually made Winston more connected to O’Brian and the Party. In the end, Winston says he loves Big Brother. This is symbolic of the love/hate relationship in abuse. Many abuse victims still love their abuser.

If you want to have a more enriched perspective on the abusive symbolism throughout 1984, I recommend you do some research into abuse and PTSD. It will truly change the way you read Orwell."
books,fi6n6ks,t1_fi6k1bm,1582201770.0,"In 1984, no one is allowed to truly, freely communicate. So although they may begin to naturally crave “freedom” (or, as Winston speculates, instinctively, biologically feel that Ingsoc is not how human beings were meant to live), they would never be capable of openly creating a word to share to others.

As we see with Julia, who does not have a free childhood for reference (as Winston partially does), those who have never experienced even the idea of freedom often do not strive for it. Winston is concerned with overt rebellion, and Julia is mostly concerned with living how she wants within the confines.

1984 is a great symbol for mental and spiritual abuse. Those who are raised with love and kindness can see easier when they are being abused. Those who grow up in abuse often expect that everyone else is experiencing the same thing, that it is normal, and that you cannot change it or escape it (essentially believing that one must accept the circumstances and work around them)"

BPD is characterized by the extreme lack of a sense of self, a struggle to have a consistent identity.

CPTSD is, as we know, caused by external triggers as a result of prolonged, interpersonal trauma.

Now, what I mean by “practice” and “paper,” is that the two have similar symptoms (such as depression and anxiety). But there are MANY diagnosis with these as symptoms and they present differently based on the core issue. 

For example, bereavement depression is different than Seasonal Affective Disorder depression, which is different from Major Depressive Disorder depression, which is different from Bipolar Disorder depression, which is different from BPD depression, and finally CPTSD depression (which is even slightly different from PTSD).

So although it is “the same symptom,” the experiences are quite different. You could also have a combination thereof. Perhaps you had MDD but your mother just died and now, although you’re still depressed, it’s a different kind of depression. 

(This is another reason that you and your friend could have depression and experience it very differently)

So while the two have similar symptoms, the presentation of the symptoms is often markedly different. In fact, those I know with BPD, with one exception, have struggled with it since early adolescence and had healthy home lives and didn’t experience trauma outside of the home either.  Essentially, they would not meet the majority of the criteria (even the basis for diagnosis) for CPTSD, but they are a textbook definition of BPD.

There can be a simultaneous presentation of both CPTSD and BPD. From the opinion of your therapist, it sounds as though this may be your experience, where you fit the criteria for both equally well.  Initially having BPD could have made you a target or more susceptible to maltreatment which brought trauma and CPTSD, OR the confusion of the intense trauma which caused CPTSD could have led to feeling as though you do not have an identity and can not find a place in the world and develop a comorbidity with BPD.

Although I have CPTSD, I do not experience the key markers for BPD, and I have a few friends with BPD who would not meet the criteria for CPTSD and vise versa. From my experience, the two present quite differently.

This isn’t to challenge you or your therapist. This is a debated topic even within the psychiatric world; even the professionals disagree. This just happens to be one of many different opinions."
CPTSD,fhh7tin,t3_f33el0,1581596851.0,"BPD, Bipolar, and ADHD are both common misdiagnosis. People presenting with a mixture of unclear symptoms tend to get “officially” diagnosed as one or the other although they fit criteria for many others.

CPTSD is an official diagnosis in the ICD-11, which some psychiatrists and therapists prefer over the DSM-5.  IMO if BPD became the DSM-5’s CPTSD then they would need a new diagnosis to cover those with BPD. 

In my experience, if a diagnosis for CPTSD cannot be made (because they strictly follow DSM-5) then typically they just go with the umbrella diagnosis of PTSD.  Although you can have BOTH BPD and PTSD.

But you will never be able to because your mind recognizes your pinky as a finger, your own body part, and physically will not let you. You can make up your mind to bite it off, but no matter how much determination you have, you will never be able to.”"
badfriends,fh8509c,t3_f1p2wx,1581352163.0,"F1 and F2 sound like terrible friends. I would suggest trying to make new friends or at least distancing yourself from these “friends.”  

I don’t know if you already have (or if you feel comfortable doing so), but perhaps now would be a good time to express how you feel to your mother, so she can understand what is going on in your life and support you in finding better peers.

You sound like you are trying very hard to be a good person/friend and that some of your current friends can sometimes make that difficult. Honestly, no friends are better than shitty friends. Sorry you had to deal with this OP"
CPTSD,fgg3zc7,t3_ex6ixv,1580753748.0,"You can always post in this sub about what you were invalidated about. We can validate your trauma, and some of us may be able to relate. Invalidation makes you feel like you’re alone. It isolates you. But you’re not alone. We believe you.   We’re here to support each other. 

When my friends invalidate my trauma, I come here. It’s a breath of fresh air. People who’ve never experienced trauma literally cannot comprehend it. Just know they’re ignorant. Understanding is healing. Look to your support systems to brace yourself against the pain of invalidation"
CPTSD,fg74qfk,t1_fg6wabt,1580583959.0,"Yes!! Although it’s painful, I whole heartedly believe it was the right thing to do. Not only did it reduce my stress, so I can give them a better quality me, but it shows them that they can also eventually escape.

When you live in a home like that, it feels as though it will never end. Being an independent adult almost seems impossible. The best thing you can do is leave and give them hope. Show them there’s a life outside the toxic family and give them a safe place to go when they need to get away.

It’s hard, but it is worth it!! For both of you!!"

AskReddit,fg68i3r,t3_ewtwe9,1580558961.0,I began to see how my friend’s families interacted and how they functioned in comparison to my family and how I functioned.  I found out as at 19 that I had PTSD and had it since I was around 9 years old.
CPTSD,fg687i5,t1_fg4lyhe,1580558555.0,"Although the World Health Organization’s International Classification of Diseases (11th Edition) now considers CPTSD to be a legitimate diagnosis. Some providers in the USA have a preference toward the ICD-11 rather than the DMS-5, so you can still get a diagnosis in the US.

But you are correct: a diagnosis is not required to participate in the sub"
CPTSD,fg67ioo,t3_ewxizp,1580557597.0,"My abusive parents were strict Mormons, so we weren’t allowed to have caffeine. As an adult, I hardly notice any effects at all from caffeine. Sometimes I think I even sleep better right after a cup of coffee."
CPTSD,fg65be1,t3_eww47d,1580554404.0,"I grew up with 9 younger siblings. I started babysitting when I was 6 years old. I raised the last 4. 

It’s a unique experience being parentified. You’re never allowed to be a child, which is extremely important from a developmental standpoint.  As an adult, a lot of people minimize this (granted they often cannot understand). They say, “I’m sure you helped out a lot, but you won’t get what it’s like to be a parent until you have your own children.” That gets very annoying.

My parents, since I moved out 3 years ago, have tried to turn my siblings (including and especially the ones I raised) against me and spread lies about me to them. It’s very difficult.

I say, it feels a though I lost a custody battle and my parents got to keep the kids. It’s especially painful to know that my parents deliberately attempt to bad-mouth me to them."
CPTSD,fg63trt,t3_ewza76,1580552164.0,"I always felt like an alien too. I felt almost instinctively that I must have been sent here by mistake, like some other soul was meant to inhabit my body and I got sent instead.

Sometimes I also feel as though in another life I must have been very bad and this life is my punishment, like Earth is actually hell in disguise.

I have a lot of dissociative issues, though, so it’s more likely the derealization and depersonalization."
AskReddit,fg1yhl1,t3_ewcpzl,1580435125.0,"Last year one of my best friends texted me asking why I wasn’t in class. I admitted to her I was severely suicidal and had basically spent the past week desperately avoiding killing myself. She texted me the pages to the homework and nothing else.

I get not everyone knows what to say, and I don’t expect to be coddled, but I don’t know if there’s a clearer way for someone to communicate that they don’t care about you."
