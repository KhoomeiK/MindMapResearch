For one, the sooner you can make your own money the better. Idk if this applies to you, but it is one less way people can control / exert leverage over you, meaning if you're like me that you can cut out people who are unhealthy from your inner circle. This for me was my parents. They are my parents, but it helps to not have them be decision makers at all in my life.

Secondly, with the people not that close but still very much close and in your life, decide honestly and brutally who you believe has **you** and **your** best interests in their mind. Many people will ""want what is best for you"" but when you take stock you realize they honestly have never even put **you** first, they just put the **idea** of ""their relative"" or the **idea** of ""their classmate"" or the **idea** of ""their old friend"" first.

This is hard but on the other side things are a lot better in my experience. Lonelier at first but if you sit through that initial loneliness you might find, as I did, that you meet yourself in a way you never have for the first time, and that while you miss those people you would not bring them back in to your life even if you wanted to. It is literally not worth it. Having them gone for a while can show that."

Same, and this really hurts me more. I also think it deepens the long term damage we all face and decimates our chance of any true recovery.

This theory comes from listening to The Last Symptom podcast. On it the host poses that BPD comes from a distorted core belief which is the belief that ""my emotions are not valid or are unimportant.""

I think in a case of a lasting mental state categorized by delusion, I feel it would still fall to the person to make the choice when faced with the question, is that a life they want?

But, to support you again, it could be easily reasoned that they should be forced into the hospital and if they eventually want to kill themselves they can without telling anybody.

I do believe that genuinely talking about suicide with your family and friends is a good idea.

I liked the honesty. Both in terms of it not holding back and in not overindulging itself."
netflix,flq5edx,t1_flo1477,1585379812.0,I liked the vibe but the story was far weaker then Ghibli. Any suggestions?

Schizoid,flq5b67,t3_fpqulw,1585379709.0,"yep. I don't want it but it might happen without marriage. I would be ok with a close relationship and a child, but truthfully the kid would have to be with someone who I don't care abt b/c anyone I could relate to / understand wouldn't want to physically go through carrying and giving birth. If I get rich I would use a surrogate and nannies but at that point... I also don't know how to get rich avoiding every single person.

And it wouldn't be fair to the kid. Their life would objectively be terrible I would be a terrible father. If they come around and are also connectionless I would be a good father. It would be easy to explain to them that they don't have to care about anyone.

And it would do more good than a parent who pitied them for being who they are. I would have preferred this myself."

Schizoid,flq48oj,t3_fq4gll,1585378499.0,yes because I know he would understand how to leave me alone. I don't think we would spend time together for fun
BPD,flq4647,t1_flq2wch,1585378416.0,"To be honest it has caused me a lot more pain than good but I learned because I went to Therapeutic Programs and Boarding School for a very long time from a very young age. I was effectively parented by 16 year olds so I learned how to be a selfish jerk. Idk if that helps, but I guess the practical way to put it is it's ok to just push the space a bit. People might react negatively but it also might work."
BPD,flq2sta,t3_fq1nvp,1585376916.0,"I relate 100%. I am either exactly like that or a total pig to I think create space, like my overconfidence can make enough room for me to feel small safely"
