You can be whoever you want to be. You can acknowledge the painful things that happened and draw a clear line on what is OK and what is not. and I'll say this.. as difficult as it is, becoming financially independent is the number one way to become your own person.

But you also have so realize that you are more than your work. You are also not just your interests. Everyone you meet everywhere you go is a complicated person made up of many experiences that built them. We all go through highs and lows, and the more you humble yourself and accept that you are not alone in all this, the easier it will be to find support. Dreams may be unrealistic but I think it's hard to realize on your own how important they are. It's so easy to give up, but life becomes a dull meaningless shell without them. And if everyone put down their instruments and quieted their music, the world would be a silent, cold place. You never know who you may touch with your sound.

so yes, we groomers can take steps to prevent ourselves from getting the virus by wearing gloves, washing dogs first, having zero contact with owners.. BUT we really can't groom a dog without getting our own particles on it. even with gloves and a mask you can still distribute enough viral particles to transmit it to the owner. that's the other half of this debate which is that one asymptomatic groomer can spread the virus to a number of households just by grooming their pets :/"

We lock the door to the lobby after the client comes in and the dog runs right to them no lead (they are to bring the lead back and put it on them on their own). we also take every dog straight into the bath at drop off and wear gloves and a mask while doing so. 

The cases in my area are low but still increasing so I definitely feel torn about it. But other salons are re-opening and the demand is HUGE since pretty much all salons have been closed for a month or two now across the province. So we either re-opened or watch all the business go to everyone else--the clients are desperate. 

i would say if you guys haven't closed yet, depending on the spread where you live it is worthwhile to close for a bit. That way you can see how things go. There are some places that genuinely have had little to no spread. but if you are within driving distance of somewhere with a lot of cases and lockdowns I'd definitely close.

doggrooming,fmzj2me,t3_fy857f,1586521937.0,"I moved from Chicago to Halifax Nova Scotia. I had been with PetSmart in a few states for about 5 years when I moved...was supposed to transfer to a PetSmart up here, but after some fumbling and massive turnover in their management I ended up working for a private salon instead. The hourly vs commission thing is just going to depend on the salon you work in. Currently I make hourly and I’m definitely happy with it. Also the salon I’m at has bathing staff so we groomers only groom, don’t bathe/dry/prep our own dogs. We also only work 4 days a week but I’m making the same as I did working commission at PetSmart in the US, and more than I would’ve here (there is a cultural dislike for the corporate chains in this smaller part of the country).

But the biggest different coming from the US to Canada is just quality of life stuff. The obvious universal healthcare, friendlier culture. And Atlantic Canada is as friendly as it comes, so I never feel like a customer has power over me or can demand things from me. It is totally reasonable and not rude here to just tell someone “no I can’t keep your dog any longer than that. You have to bring them more often or brush more at home.” Back in a corporate setting/back in the states there is this “the customer is always right” mentality that does not exist as strongly up here. Majority of clients treat you like a human being and actually I’ve made a lot of friendships with clients and coworkers up here through that fact. 

So basically I’d say the job description is the same, little details will change from salon to salon. But for me personally the general niceness of people up here is a major quality of life improvement for the profession.

Also if you want to make big $$$ and groom at a more professional high end scale go to Alberta. I know groomers in my province that fly to Alberta every spring to make extra money in Calgary because there is just a high demand and some big wallets out there lol"

I personally wish that we could evaluate and somehow only take the pets who seriously need it like matted or very long haired pets who would be at risk of harm from not being shaved professionally for a month. the vast majority of dogs would just get shaggy, but there is a small percentage that could become hurt by a lack of grooming."

Veterinary,fjaa4k8,t1_fja6rzx,1583169459.0,"I actually have reached out to OSU because they are my number 1 and they said that is totally acceptable. They don't discriminate and in fact encourage students to take their online courses. But otherwise I'm pretty much just applying literally EVERYWHERE and praying for a miracle lol

Illinois, Wisconsin, Iowa, Michigan, Missouri, Florida, Georgia, Auburn, NCSCU is a general list. I'm also applying to the island schools including Canada's PEI and potentially to overseas schools so long as I can save and budget it."
AmItheAsshole,fiwbc3s,t1_fivb8t2,1582780165.0,"Agree I can't believe it was so far down to find an ESH... Obviously this was a horrible experience, but jumping right on the computer to leave negative reviews before talking to literally ANYONE ELSE at the business is totally wrong IMHO. This hygienist could be the one bad egg, the practice owner could have completely sided with OP and fired the hygienist on the spot, OP could have been apologized to and accommodated. There could be other members of staff who completely understand and know about purging in detail, and would never have treated OP that way. In general, if you have a complaint with a service/company, go to them DIRECTLY to resolve it before the internet. The review would be appropriate if OP was brushed off when she reached out directly and gave them the opportunity to apologize/fix things first. Now someone looks them up and sees your review assuming their entire practice reflects the views of ONE staff member (a staff member who you don't know may have been disciplined or fired for this offense). Imagine if you lost your job because of how your coworker acted. not cool ESH :/"

Dalhousie,fiu2vda,t3_f9vga4,1582734207.0,honestly contacting the registrar or financial aid office is the way to go. I am an American international student and I find it really difficult to plan expenses when the currency exchange and random fees can change at any time without real notice. Not to mention that different courses cost different tuition rates and may have other fees associated that are not necessarily listed in the tuition map.
Dalhousie,fitkfw6,t3_f9mv8w,1582722670.0,"1310/20 is for health sciences, 1190/1290 for engineering. The course loads and focuses are a little different, but in general they are both just introductory university physics classes. You decide which one to take based upon your intended degree program."
Dalhousie,fip5jdu,t1_fibrjfe,1582598505.0,"I gotta give her credit.. The memes and over-excitedness at the first class made me really really want to not attend another one. It felt a little too middle-school for a university, but ultimately she ended up being one of the strongest most organized most interesting and genuine profs I've ever had. Not too mention Lara being a lab instructor extraordinaire :)"
Dalhousie,fip55w1,t1_fim6h9u,1582598263.0,"to me he rushed through everything and became frustrated at any not understanding him. He'd just repeat it the same three times and then move on, even in tutorials. Bardouille could speak slowly and clearly and used his resources to make sure everyone was on the same page. For perspective.. I got a C with Monchesky and an A for Bardouille. Felt like a cakewalk the second term"
Dalhousie,fip4w8a,t1_fie0kmh,1582598091.0,"the favorite thing comes from when one girl asked a question at a review and he said something like ""if you were at the lecture you would have heard me say blah blah"" and gave her a non-answer. About 15 min later a student up front who he called on by name asked the EXACT SAME QUESTION and he went into extreme detail to answer it and repeated the student's name like six times. To the kid up front, yeah it must've felt great. But there are hundred of people in his class. The reality it he isn't going to get to know everybody. He SHOULD still treat everybody the same with the same energy, even if he doesn't know their name and see them in the front row."
Dalhousie,fid4i0t,t1_fiaithu,1582362240.0,Seriously he was my least favorite how did we even have the same guy? Lol sorry but he was miserable. Self-inflated and had clear favorites. That class sucked and I was so much happier in the second term with the other guy

dating_advice,fic0z3t,t3_f7icu4,1582334913.0,"I honestly have been guilty of this.. not the ghosting but just the feigned enthusiasm after a date. For me, it just feels rude or maybe unwise to admit to being unsure about whether or not you actually like someone to that someone. Like I constantly go on dates, feel disappointed, but then wonder if I am being too judgemental. While I'm stewing on it I don't want to ignore the person or say I'm not sure if I'm still interested, so I do end up saying things like ""I loved our date"" or ""I'm so excited for our next date"" etc. But then if I end up feeling like NO I'm not excited, I don't really like this person, I message them that I'm not interested and apologize. It's just really difficult to decide whether to pursue something when there is no immediate spark or chemistry"

These are invaluable years of my young life to meet someone... I am sorry that I'm not always available, but I deserve to be on dating apps as much as anyone else, even if it means I'm inevitably going to frustrate someone with my limited availability."
dating_advice,fibzpzd,t1_fibhgyp,1582334023.0,OK real question... I'm 27 and just heard of hinge recently... are there really other human beings on there? It just sort of sprung up out of nowhere adding nothing to the dating pool mix it seems. I never made an account because it seems pointless. is it as pointless as it appears? or should i be gettin on there
zoos,fia3aup,t3_es548j,1582291846.0,It's sad they didn't get to see it through.. but I do love Great Bear Wilderness! Probably the best new addition. Personally I feel that they should expand on North & South American animals in the coming years (so happy we have the coatimundi now!) Also the indoor section of Pachyderm house needs some love.
offmychest,fi8tnsx,t1_fi8pdnn,1582248094.0,"In all fairness she has been active as a ""rescue"" for almost four years now. But yeah she is open about the fact that she has no actual training, she just learned from rehabilitating her own rescue dog. There is only really one person on her facebook page who has accused her or called her out about an issue with a dog, but her other ""customers"" seem satisfied with their results. Still I personally feel that a rescue/rehab trainer should be trained official themselves AND if she wants to have more than 6 dogs at a time it should not be in a private home. It should be a non-profit or business facility."
offmychest,fi8sp8d,t1_fi7yvbi,1582247456.0,"I kinda said this to someone else lower in the thread, but I just feel like it should be said that everyone is coming from their own walks of life. You don't always know whether or not the person making the jokes has had those experiences themselves. Humor may simply be their way of coping. Whatever happened to you or them can't be changed in that moment right? And they owe you nothing, you owe them nothing in that moment. So you need to find your way to cope as well. If it's getting up and walking out, that's fine. If it's plugging your ears or closing your eyes or something, that's another approach. Asserting your views on the person telling the joke is technically a way to cope but it's not the kindest way, because it puts that person making light of it in a difficult position where they either have to double down on the joke or face something that they may not be ready to face. Just remember that the person making light is a person with their own experiences and if you want to approach them about it, especially with these subjects it's kinder to do it one-on-one with empathy instead of in a group setting. 

also you note that you don't mind gore... To some people sexual assault humor is no problem but gore is horrific. They may have seen people be murdered or injured in real life and been emotionally scarred. It wouldn't be fair for them to impose their perspective on you either. Your life has given you a certain emotional pallet. You gotta recognize not everyone's working with the same paint eh?"
offmychest,fi8rwzq,t1_fi8hiad,1582246921.0,"it didn't personally offend me, but he had a whole bit in his latest standup special sticks & stones about the boys who accused Michael Jackson. Something along the lines of they should be grateful he did that to them because they got free trips to Hawaii out of it.

anyway in short I'm saying you can't always call someone out for saying something that bothers you. It's not always a dialogue. So suggesting that OP call them out is unhelpful. Most of the people are just telling jokes and you need to find a way to personally cope without the joke-teller being involved at all, because really their humor is not directed at you personally. Neither you nor that person can change whatever's happened to you, and you don't owe each other anything from it. So OP just needs to find their own way to cope with the fact that other people are out there having other experiences and speaking from their experience."

I am a professional dog groomer of 7 years and I can't believe your dog's coat. I am so, so sorry, please don't be offput or offended but that is shameful. Your pet does NOT deserve to live like that. Again I am sorry and this is hard to swallow but holy fucking shit you would not wear a 5 inch thick sweater and not remove it for years at a time, so why should the dog. Please dear god please get a brush and work on that coat or take them to a groomer because I literally spit out my drink when I saw this and it will keep me up tonight knowing this animal is in this state.

god bless"
