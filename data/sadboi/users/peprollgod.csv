 Second, the seeming loss of time.  Going down the rabbit hole of YT, Reddit, etc is a bigger time drain than a lot of people realize.  
Third, the job.  Having a job you actually like then losing it sucks hard.  Hopefully, you can find another one you can at least tolerate. 
 Fourth, the debt.  Pay it back as you can.  Make that a top priority when you get another job.  
Fifth, glad your dad is ok now.  Having close family injured or ill takes up a ton of energy.
