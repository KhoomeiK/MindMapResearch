Do you have a psychologist or therapist you trust you’d be able to talk to about this? Full disclosure I’m just another crazy person but from what I know about ASPD disorders (not saying you have that, your story just reminded me of it) there’s no way to medicate your way out of low empathy, but various modalities of therapy can be really helpful. There are people who don’t experience empathy despite therapy and who have still been able to live moral lives and have relationships and not screw people over, because they made that decision.
