One of Israel's (the children of Abraham) biggest issues throughout history has been it's inability to grow by conversion. We have made many choices in the history of the modern church that has helped in our growth and development. Strongest militia in Illinois, why wasn't it used? Would have saved Joseph but would have lost the church by creating a war with the U.S. How much money do you think we spent on all those t.v. commercials over the years?  The recent changes to different policies at BYU have obviously been due, in part, to the poor PR we were getting in relation to how we were seen as being hateful of gays. We do PR and, it is necessary. My son was sent back from his mission in Honduras. While it was certainly a safety measure, it was also a PR move. Can you imagine what a bunch of ""rich white people"" still able to get food and supplies would look like to the rest of the country there and throughout the world? My nephew is in Italy on his mission and they have been left to quarantine in place along with most of the  rest of the European West mission. Why is that? I don't know but if it was as terrible as the news would have us to believe, they wouldn't still be there.

So, do I believe it could be a P.R. move? Sure. Could it be a way to decrease liability from lawsuits that you know are going to come out of this? Sure. Could it be that the President of the Church is also a doctor and understands the gravity of the situation w/o needing God to direct him? Sure. Could it be that God is telling them to do these things? Sure. I'm good with all the possible answers. 

I still have a responsibility to ask of God what is right for me and my family. I'm a patriarch of my family and have been giving the blessings related to that calling. So far I have felt comforted by the brethren and the way they have handled this. But I don't believe for a minute that they are who we should look to for a decision on when we should open back up the economy. Joseph and the church have had bank failures and investment failures. The church has taken losses in the market and on real estate. Why? Because God does not sit back and pull the strings like a puppet master. We were given agency to learn how to use it. That agency is in play now and we all ought to be seeking our own council on what we should be doing to take care of ourselves."

I do see the value in the history of the Old Testament aspect but of course only to a point as it is still steeped in superstition and oral traditions. 

I exaggerated my feelings on the New Testament a bit and I find value in many of the parables but I do always have the manipulation aspect in the back of my mind. My point on Mark was meant as an example, I wasn't really sure which of the 4 Gospels was the last just that I head read on Fair Mormon about the length of time afterward that it was written. It is like many of the prophecies that have been passed down in the church, when you look at the details of them, they come from the grandkids of 2nd hand accounts.

I have not looked much into the history of changes in D&C so I cant really respond about that but when you look at all the various councils and fighting that went on with the various translations and that they were generally led by men with political agendas more than true religious intent. I think the works used by the Greek and Russian Orthodox churches are closer to the original as they haven't had all the infighting in the middle ages."

All you have to do is look at the history of the Papacy and the way that they manipulated the bible teaching to try and control the peasants and it really makes it hard to take it word for word. Most of the accounts were not actually written until centuries after Christ's life (If I remember correctly they think the earliest was John and it was still decades after Christ died) and then it was re-written and translated based on  the prevailing religious arguments of the day. 

I always have found it funny how evangelicals can be so certain that there can be no other scripture when they also think that the Catholic Church is evil and that is the only source of their bibles. 

We were talking about this at a family dinner tonight and I said that if I was to somehow discover that the church is not true than I can no longer be Christian because the only possible way the truth could have made it through the middle ages is by a restoration of it in more modern times.

This whole process is a waste of taxpayers money and really a disgrace to themselves and those that elected them. (I think even more poorly of liberal Californians than I did before because they somehow can keep voting for Nadler when he is such an obvious punk.)

The only reason that the Dems are doing this is the same reason the Reps impeached Clinton. They couldn't beat him at the polls, and are not expecting to be able to this next cycle either.

Every President in the modern era has fired or asked for resignations from Ambassadors who could not carry out their role.

Nelson has been so open about it, that she understands more that our leaders upbringing and traditions factor into some of the things we have been taught.

Ask your wife how she understands revelation to occur. My understanding is that it really occurs when the prophet/apostles go to the Father with specific questions. Does she really think that the brethren have gone and asked God if oral sex is ok? I'm not buying that. 

It might also help to remind her that it wasn't too long ago that Pres Hinckley off handedly answered Mike Wallace on 60 minutes that we don't drink caffeinated soda and now you can find it all over BYU Campus.

One last point. God built us with these bodies, urges and all. Does it make sense to her that he has given women bodies that generally can't Orgasm from missionary position sex?

I think our problem is trying to expect people with a completely different view of the universe to act like we would. Different beliefs, different educations and different social structures that are all built to destroy the west. We have to quit trying to do regime change with groups of people that only know a ""Strongman"" form of government. We can't expect American style democracy to work in places where they have only known tribalism and strength through conflict for thousands of years."
latterdaysaints,fcwutxb,t3_ejagfi,1578038538.0,"So Stephen Covey developed and taught the 7 Habits for years and most people are somewhat familiar with it. The 7th Habit is to Sharpen the Saw. The idea is that in order for you to be any good to yourself or anyone else you need to take care of yourself. (dull saws don't cut or do it poorly)

As part of the Habit 7 training he taught that when you sit down each week to do your planning you should make sure that you set personal goals for each of the 4 areas of your life. I think that it is critically important for the kids to understand that while you will be working on 1 area of development, say physical, for a period of time, they should include working on each of these areas of their life at least every week if not every day. I personally would prefer the monthly rotation as opposed to quarterly just because kids attention span are so short and I think that keeping them motivated for 3 months on a certain area might be hard. 

FranklinCovey (the company that develops and sells 7 Habits programs and content, have an education program called Leader in Me where they teach 7 Habits to Elementary aged in kids. There was a 7 Habits for Families and 7 Habits for teens as well and they may have helpful materials around sharpening the saw for kids and youth as well. (I know it is the church's new program but they got it from somewhere and the 4 areas of development are exactly the same as the sharpening the saw piece)

[https://www.franklincovey.com/Solutions/education/7habits-teen.html](https://www.franklincovey.com/Solutions/education/7habits-teen.html) might be helpful but you may have to be from a school to get any of the materials.

They closed most the FranklinCovey stores and sold the planner business to a company called Franklin Covey Products that still sells planners and all the forms etc. I no longer use a planner but I do still actually order these Weekly Compasses for when I plan each week.

I am not sure that there will ever be words that you will be able to use that will convince her or even soften her heart but your example of living a Christlike life is something that will at least give her pause to consider her position. Plenty of scriptures in the bible about knowing good and evil by the fruits they produce.

My argumentative side wants you to ask her if she is so certain the Catholic church is not true, why does she base her belief in the godhead on a conference of Catholic clergy who created it. If the Catholics were wrong, why does she believe that the scriptures that were passed and translated through both good and evil members of the Catholic church are the only word of God. I'd ask why God was willing to speak to ancient Jews but nobody else. I'd ask what they are planning for all the people that have lived on earth without hearing and accepting the gospel. I'd ask her what they believe the purpose of life is and what the Plan of Salvation is for those that haven't lived in the last few hundred years. That is what I would want to ask her but, it would never help her come to understanding the gospel.

Be a great example in your life, pray for her heart to be softened and continue to love and accept her. It's the only way the spirit can be present."

We have wasted way too many lives and treasure on a region that will never know stability. The people do not have the same education or background as western nations and are never going to choose, and hold, a democratic type of government. 

I always struggle with what I think the solution is because I do think that there is some responsibility by stronger nations to defend the rights of minority populations in areas where they are being exterminated, as the Kurds were in Iraq, but I am not sure how to balance that with the belief that we can't and shouldn't be the world's police and we aren't very good at making changes in distant parts of the world anyway."

Generally you are able to be seen as long as will be needed and even if it is going longer than the 10 visits most Bishops will still help out and or the therapists often have a sliding scale based on income.

You likely also have resources through your school. My son was diagnosed as bipolar and the university has been amazingly helpful. The have councilors, psychiatrists and once when he was feeling particularly suicidal he was able to walk into the health center and a nurse sat with him until his wife was able to get there. The universities are dealing with lots of mental health issues and so most have set up support systems for that.

I am also born of an unwed mother and a father that never wanted to see me. I know that it can feel like you were given the short end of the stick but you have to know that you are not in anyway being ""cursed"". Heavenly Father loves you and wants the best for you. Our mothers made bad choices that impacted our life. Doesn't mean that HF wants to bless you any less than anyone else. If you look at the blessing of having the gospel introduced to you and your mom you can really see how the blessing of the gospel and learning about the proper role of families is a huge gift for you and your future. You are being taught the proper role of fathers and families and you can take the things that you have learned to be a change agent. You will be the person that breaks the cycle and is able to marry, have children and raise them faithfully in the church. This will change your children's, grandchildren's and other descendents into the eternities.

I'll always have a bit of the feeling of rejection from my father. It is what it is and something that I have grown to realize is too bad for him and not me. I now have an awesome wife and kids and he is the one missing out for not having us part of his life."

I suggest you look into Pathways, it is great for people exactly in your situation. [https://www.byupathway.org/pathwayconnect](https://www.byupathway.org/pathwayconnect)

The church is amazing in it's foresight with this program. The way that it is set up is that you spend the first year learning how to be a student again. There will be math and english integrated with life skills that are needed to be successful in your education, life and family. After the first year you move into BYU Idaho's online degree program but the way it is set up is through working on ""certificates"" that you earn as you work towards your degree. The beauty of the way it is set up is that you have actual provable/marketable job skills that you are earning along the way that help you in getting promotions, better jobs etc. Instead of waiting for the full 4 years before the benefit of education kicks in, you get that right away. it is also set up to get you your education credits at a much lower cost than you could anywhere else on earth. Once you finish your degree it is from BYU-I.

Please take a look at the opportunity. We have had 2 classes go through their first year and are now either working on their certificate/degrees or are going to be starting on them in Jan.

Good luck and God bless you in your journey!"

How you don't see that having the FBI being co-opted is much worse is beyond me. They illegal surveilled and purposely mislead courts to spy on American citizens.

I can’t answer what you should do for you but it seems to me that if you have been praying and asking if you should tell her your feelings and you haven’t gotten an answer that you feel is a clear yes than I would see that as a no for a couple reasons. 
1- she is on a mission serving the lord right now and I would want to have a burning bush like experience before I took her mind of the mission. 
2- even though you have strong feelings, you are still relatively young to be stressing about marriage. It’s great and all but there is plenty of time for that later, don’t force an issue that is eternal. 
3- my experience is that it is better for people not to wait for others on their missions. The person on the mission is developing for those 2 years while the person at home waiting kind of stunting their growth and maturity during that time. Better to risk losing her and finding the right girl later than to have her wait a couple of years and realize you no longer feel the same way."

The MTC will really be a breeze for you. You will almost not even notice you are in a foreign country because you are in class and on the MTC campus the whole time. No real interaction with anyone that isn't a member who is working at the MTC. 

Your 5 years of spanish will help you a ton. I realize you don't think you remember much of it now but you will be surprised how quickly it will come to you once you are studying and have the spirit helping you. I would suggest studying your conjugations as much as you can now and throughout your mission. Getting these right is where someone's spanish really makes a difference in how you communicate. The vocabulary will come as you speak more.

I'm sorry that you are going through all the anxiety right now. I agree with one of the other comments that you ought to  chat with your doctor about wether or not anit-anxiety meds would help. Try to focus on the things that you know and that you can control. Your work/study effort, serving those around you and things like that can give you more control of your situation and help alleviate some of your worries.

I'm not sure how to help except to say that anger is going to get anything done. My wife being angry all the time can make me feel bad but it doesn't magically motivate me. I'd like it to. I want to just be in constant motion, it just is something weird that doesn't ever get going.

One thing I might suggest is try to look for the things they are doing that you can appreciate or complement. It's easy to find things you are unhappy about but it is much more motivating  when there is appreciation shown.

An example, my wife bought a chair. I go and pick it up from the store, carry it in from outside by myself (says to team lift but I wanted to surprise her) build the chair (not Ikea but there was still some putting it together) all just because I wanted to do it for her without her having to say anything. When I'm done I take the box it came in out to the garage, I put the box on top of another box without really looking at it and think its all good. Turns out that the box I put it on was a box of Christmas stuff my wife needed the next day and so she gets mad that she needed to move the chair box to get to the Christmas box. So she is going off on how I couldn't take the time to cut up the box and throw it away and I'm getting pissed because I'm not understanding how it can be so bad when I did everything else. I figure she is just so angry that all she does is look for negative things now so everytime something goes wrong it just reinforces her bad thinking about me and she ignores any thing that I do that she likes and didn't have to ask or remind me. It makes me not care to try.

So, look for what you can see that is positive and maybe focus on that if you can. It is more motivating than getting yelled at.

There is also a LDS focused Facebook group that is about sexuality in marriage that is a bit more progressive than most LDS discussions that I have seen. I'm not saying that I agree with everything that is posted/said but I do find rethinking the way that we think about sexuality to be refreshing. As we have seen lately with many of the things Pres Nelson has been changing, much of what we have believed and done in the past has been traditions brought over from personal opinions of leaders who were themselves influenced by the early Puritanical teachings in the U.S.  [https://www.facebook.com/groups/IIIMM/?multi\_permalinks=570470867081752&notif\_id=1575419314034062&notif\_t=group\_highlights](https://www.facebook.com/groups/IIIMM/?multi_permalinks=570470867081752&notif_id=1575419314034062&notif_t=group_highlights)

I also have found Dr. Jenifer Finlayson-Fife to have sound advice that comes from a place of understanding that sexuality is a blessing we have been given, not something we have to repress, something we need to direct correctly and all part of the plan. [http://www.finlayson-fife.com/podcast-archive/2019/9/26/the-perils-of-perfectionism](http://www.finlayson-fife.com/podcast-archive/2019/9/26/the-perils-of-perfectionism)  She is not a fan of porn for all the reasons you hear about but is also realistic about what winning the way really looks like.

So my summary- You should stay away from porn. If you don't you are sinning (if nothing else you are watching other people in adulterous relationships which is obviously against the plan) but as with everything else there are differing degrees of severity. Dr. Finlayson-Fife and other LDS psychologists seem to be speaking more in terms of controlling use than believing that you will ever just completely quit. I think that they are probably closer to reality than not."
