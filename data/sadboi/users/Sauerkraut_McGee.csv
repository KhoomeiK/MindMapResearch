Sinus headaches can be overdiagnosed; migraines are often what's really going on. They can seem very much alike, including things like feeling worse when you lean your head over.

ADHD,fiyr1za,t3_fagyh7,1582845036.0," I think you're going to be a great teacher! Kids need that kind of understanding - that extra patience, and the willingness to look beyond the ""difficult"" behavior to what's happening inside. What's extra good about teaching kids who ""don't like school"" and ""aren't trying"" is that the things you do to help them are beneficial to ALL the kids in the classroom. 

Your students will be lucky to have you!"

Menopause,fim6tw7,t3_f8ljkw,1582519838.0,"Ughh, I had that ""just about to get my period feeling"" last month, and I haven't had an actual period in over half a year. Cramps, bloating, ovary pain, exhaustion for a week, and then it just went away. For now. 

No advice here, just commiseration."
