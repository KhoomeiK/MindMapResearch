Being married and having a kid have kept me alive, although that’s a net loss for me.

The cancer is a new addition.  The medical debt from that will keep me chained to my godawful marriage for the rest of my life.

depression,fcjqjbc,t1_fcjouh1,1577699576.0,"> “Out of love” can do more harm than good.

I’d say it *usually* does more harm than good.  There was an article in the NYT yesterday about a man who murdered his wife because she had Alzheimer’s.  The shitbag journalist said, with complete sincerity and approval, that it was “an act of love.”  When people talk about doing something “out of love” to a person with a disability or mental illness, what they really mean is “because I can” or “for the sake of power.”

P.S. Just gonna preemptively respond to some of the defenses of domestic violence and murder that are coming my way now.  

* This was not “assisted suicide,” this was murder.  It was not done with her knowledge or informed consent; he shot her in the head while she was taking a nap.

* He had repeatedly been offered actual, tangible help by people in the position to help, and he refused each time.  Then he murdered his wife.  This was about violence and control, not love.

* Assisted suicide and the right to die are one thing, and something I generally support because I am in favor of people having more agency in their own lives, but this was not a case of that.  This was a case of a man sneaking up on a sleeping woman and shooting her in the head.  This was murder.

* Maybe you have a story about Alzheimer’s, maybe you don’t.  Maybe you’ve seen someone die from it, even.  Maybe you’ve decided you absolutely do not want to go that way and would rather die with more of your faculties intact.  That’s your right.  I’m all for people deciding what they want to do with their own lives.  And, again, that’s not what happened here.  Here, a man refused every offer of outside assistance for his wife with Alzheimer’s, then murdered her in her sleep."

depression,f8tlm25,t1_f8tkkev,1574805985.0,"I never said there was a legitimate medical need to sic the cops on him, and I’m sorry if I gave that impression.  From what you’ve described, he sounds more like he’s moping and pouting than actively suicidal.  However, if he steps up the behavior or starts bothering you, you absolutely could spin his behavior as warning signs—or even just say you’re legitimately concerned for his wellbeing, which isn’t even a lie—and have someone perform a welfare check.  Having the cops show up at your door or spending 72 hours in a psych hold can be the kick in the pants some people need to stop harassing their exes.

I hope it doesn’t come to that, but it is an option.  Good luck."

depression,f82xlaa,t3_cml6ni,1574200173.0,"Imagine getting carjacked by a rabid bear that can somehow talk.

The bear wants you to drive it to the airport.  The bear also has *opinions* on which way you should go to the airport, but doesn't tell you about them until it's already decided you're driving the wrong way.  The bear lets you know by roaring and swiping its claws at you, by grabbing the steering wheel and yanking it in random directions, by honking the horn at people stopped at red lights, and by screaming **""LEARN TO TAKE FEEDBACK!""** whenever you ask it to stop or say the bear almost caused you to have a wreck.  Imagine the bear roaring at your kid in the back seat when the kid starts crying (because there is a damn rabid bear in the car roaring at people) and blames you.

That's pretty much what it's like driving my wife anywhere.

**BONUS POINTS:** And now, assuming the ""call me if you need anything"" people *still* won't pick up the phone to take the kid for a couple hours, I'm going to miss a *third* doctor's appointment while she dicks around in Vegas thru next week."
