I know how you can feel the pressure and apply as many places as you can, (and idk what type of work your looking for) but if you can gear your resume for specific jobs, and prepare a custom cover letter why you should work there. Do some research on the company and mention what you like. Some jobs there is so many people applying, they have filters that exclude people automatically, look into that, for instance as small things like, if you are applying with a Hotmail or yahoo email address. Just polish that resume and stick with it."
