The fundamental idea of non-attachment and going to nirvana was ""poisoned"" when buddhists introduced the idea that we must save all of humanity, and that is the most noble action one can do.

And yet they can live out purpose in the eyes of those who see value in it. Whether it is as food, as beauty, as completing the circle of life. Isn't that just our perception and what we make of it?

I say that because there is no need to ""exit the matrix"", not in the way most people talk about it. That is a desire to escape the harshness of reality, or the harshness of one phase of life (descent in the circle). At some point, when you work deeply on knowing the totality of yourself, you are the full circle, so you get to experience the ups and downs all the time, and there is a balance. And then it's no longer a circle, you enter a flow of life. you break the matrix by becoming it - I suggest reading the article (full article if you have time) with this lens.

The law of 3 exposes the reality of the third side of the coin. A coin cannot be two-sided in reality. It can only look 1-sided or 2-sided in an illusion.

Take a moment to find out something about someone before you make a wild assumption. People should feel the natural guilt and shame that comes with hurting another person, this is essential to growth, what is not essential is the added guilt and shame from society, and also when people do not face this, which most people do not really face the depth of it, it keeps accumulating and building and hurting them and others even more. If you cannot see this spiral, perhaps you have to look into your shadow before talking about spiritual bypassing. The guilt and shame is what is going to give us answers if there is any hope to change the course, and even if there will be an extinction, why not go out having faced our shadows? To finally own up to our shit and do what we should have done a long time ago."
Meditation,fkfr8ji,t1_fkfqo4p,1584140647.0,"u/morose_void_moose to add to my previous response, who you really are is beyond what you have done, and that is the point of the booklet. Finding that self is what will allow you to look past the mistakes, and maybe even do what needs to be done to ""fix"" those mistakes. Giving up is just burdening yourself and others, because your guilt and shame will project onto others, and what you feel will continue to spiral and propagate. This is what is happening in the world today, and the intention of this booklet and my work is to help change this."
Meditation,fkfqo4p,t1_fkfq58w,1584140313.0,"u/morose_void_moose If you give the booklet a read you *may* change your mind on that. I felt the same way for a long time, and have worked with many people to know that this is very prevalent. I'm not saying the mistakes and guilt are not real, but the reality is based on perception, and maybe changing your perception is what you need to finally move on. Maybe instead of regretting and giving up you can do something to change. This is not to pressure, it's a suggestion if you or anyone who comes across this wants to find a way out of the debilitating shame and guilt you have described. It's important to know it doesn't have to be permanent."
spirituality,fkfhapr,t1_fkfgmns,1584134381.0,"I went through many breakdowns, and only when fully destroyed beyond what I thought was recoverable did I start finding myself and have the ability to stay fluid without attaching to beliefs. That is what I write about in the books and that is what r/Comadism is about. It is about letting go of the certainty of our thoughts and beliefs, to be more flexible and humble about what we think is right and wrong (fraud and genuine). Once we can have room for uncertainty in a grounded way, it becomes an ally. Whether he made it up or it was real, even as a metaphor or parallel reality, the story has tremendous power for each of us to realize something profound in ourselves.

I don't think ""everything"" belongs to this being. And this is the greater source of confusion, because we have to learn to find out what is ours and what we can trust."

Someone else's experience may provide a pointer, but your answer will be unique to you.

Abandonment is one of the core issues for most people, and being able to trust is something each of us has to learn. I suggest looking for a guide to help you out because it is not easy to look into your own shadow."

The thing is to let you guard down, or have it taken down for you. Psychedelics and dreams take your guard down for you, if you do it intentionally, you can enter that state at any time.

What you had sounds profound, and if you were conscious during it, it can feel as deep as a psychedelic experience, probably it's calling you through the dream. Of course, things can get much weirder with plants, but this is a good introduction."

Because many of the things he writes about I and others have experienced personally even before reading about it, and seems very plausible for it to be real. So what makes you certain he is a fraud?

Talking about the One in your post, how can you say it is not a thought passed down from this One to keep you in control?

And there wasn't even a global event like a pandemic or anything. It was just my own mind, and I was going through an identity crisis, my personal world did come to an end at the end of those 6 months. And one morning when I woke up, I saw the sunrise, and I felt the sun is rising in my life finally. The 6 months prior to that it had felt like the sun was setting.

And just trust that they will take care of you and help you if you genuinely share how you feel lonely and depressed and suicidal.

If you cannot find an adult in your immediate surroundings, please make an effort and reach out to someone like a counselor or therapist or child services. Addressing this now will be a gift for your present self and your future self. And you deserve this. And everyone else who replied here who is in this situation deserves this. Please believe this and you will find help.

It is wonderful that you are acknowledging your feelings, and that you can say so openly that you just need a hug. Ask someone for a hug and be nice about it, and be respectful if they say yes or no, and say thank you. If they say no, ask another. Someone will respond. If it's not the girl you want, that will not be important, right now you just need a hug, and getting it will change things for you, so please make the effort and find the courage to ask for one.

depression,fk9fq7i,t3_fh6mko,1583975163.0,"This guilt and shame is debilitating, but it is arising from a perspective that what you did was wrong. Yes, it was hurtful to you when you received it, and it was hurtful to others and yourself when you inflicted it. This doesn't mean it is wrong. It happened. But not through conscious intention.

The way our society is programming us, we believe we are wrong and we made a mistake. That happened for a reason that you may not be able to understand now, but to dismiss it and minimize it to a mistake and feel guilt and shame about it is perhaps not going to help you get out of it. And this is not limited to the bullying. The right and wrong, the feeling of guilt and shame is pervasive in many obvious and subtle ways.

I went through something similar but I realized that there is something much bigger at play. My intention is not to tell you my answer, but to suggest that you go inside and review the situation from a different lens.
