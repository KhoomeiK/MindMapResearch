Play both until you hit that point to ensure you get all the unique quest rewards. Then you pick a side, which will give you a rep boost with them... You WILL NOT lose rep with the other faction.

Don't do the defend quests for them either. Just go back later when it's overrun and retake it. You'll get even more caps and more supplies for less effort.

I only get to play two or so days week but am over halfway through neighborly with both factions. It went twice as fast when I realized that both Scene Type and Assault type random encounters can spawn faction NPCs for rep. If you look up a map of random encounters and walk a loop of close by ones and either server hop or move onto a different section of the map you can rack up rep at a decent rate . As I said I put a quarter rep on raiders in about 5 hours or so."

fo76,fr0vset,t3_gm0q0h,1589807898.0,I ditched fireproof awhile ago and haven't suffered. I find it isn't necessary when you're in PA with protocols.
fo76,fr0ug97,t1_fr0sl7t,1589807012.0,"Depends. I usually work on dailies, which also give scrip. Then I'll work on Atom Challenges. Doing all those long with getting my scrip, caps and bullion for the day takes quite awhile.  Other times I work on special projects, which is currently getting a pet. Also farming rare plans... I am forever after them. When vending is actually working I also look for weapons to experiment with. Sometimes I'll even just go on super mutant killing sprees to relieve myself of resources when I need to lighten up the Stashbox. Plus any legendary I meet along the way is still a pull of the slot machine for a God tier weapon... Or it could be a 3* weightless knuckles, which no matter how heavy you happen to be is worth carrying around until the scrip reset. Or it could be just a 1* nocturnal laser Gatling which stays where it is. 5 scrip is not worth that much weight even when there's scrip in the machine."
fo76,fr0o1h0,t1_fr0brm3,1589802072.0,"I mean, is disagreeing with you really that weird. My burning question is what are you going to do once you get what you want? You're going to have to do nothing but farm mats to make 2mm EC and have no more content to work towards. We're weeks away from any significant content drop... If you're not into the events or dailies or anything else you can possibly do in this game you're going to be disappointed when you get to the prize at the end of the rope... I'd also make the argument that a long hard grind that asks me to do just a little bit every day will make getting what I want all the more sweeter. It's the like grinding out a gun as apposed to console commanding yourself a gun in another game. One is rewarding, the other is a novelty that wears off in an hour."
fo76,fqzl2tq,t1_fqzjtkj,1589769640.0,"I agree it's frustrating, but it's also not fair to pretend that adding a new thing to do on-top of the stuff we were doing before somehow subtracted from overall play time. Also it's not as if you can't do anything until you grind max rep and bullion. There's plenty of plans you can buy off the hop, including the armor, two of the four new guns and PA. Plenty of things play around with while you work your way up what you want."

fo76,fqz5m22,t3_glqh5c,1589760365.0,There comes a point where it's not even worth it to even tag certain legendaries. I don't bother shooting legendaries at events unless the other players are struggling and need help.
fo76,fqz2b7v,t1_fqz0kwe,1589758644.0,"They'll have the same SPECIAL distribution, but you'll need to swap your melee and heavy gunner cards when you want to switch between them. And FYI you can't use unarmed weapons in PA. It's usually just easier to be just unarmed regular armor or PA Heavy weapons. But it is possible to alter your build to use one or the other for free once you rank up all the required cards."
fo76,fqz0b0p,t3_glpppg,1589757631.0,"Unarmed has the highest single hit damage in the game, and heavy weapons are one of the endgame metas. You'll be good with either, though you won't be able to fuel a heavy weapon for awhile, you need to build up to it a bit."

There's dailies, and most of the events are fun especially when lots of people show up for them. Also if you're into farming (I know some people aren't, but if you do) you'll be able to do plenty of that. Priming your weapons and melting the SBQ is a rewarding challenge imo. There's also the roadmap that's currently up on the splash screen teasing the up coming content.

fo76,fqtepat,t1_fqtdn1j,1589637499.0,"Min maxers will tell you weight reduction perks are wasted points, but in reality having one or two doesn't set you back. I run batteries included on my build otherwise I'd be screwed. You will want to work on weight management though... Once you get your build where you want it you'll need to find a sweet spot where you have excess carry weight to be able to loot things, but still have a decent loadout. Personally I keep just enough available weight to be able to collect enough scrip and sellables for the daily allotments. Anything else I find to be wasted space.. But this is your build so find what works for you!"
fo76,fqte5mk,t3_gkutds,1589637146.0,"Not to say your opinion isn't fair, because it is... But 14 hours isn't really enough time to fully appreciate and understand how the game operates and how it's balanced (PvP excluded, but that's for another post). After a certain amount of time, when your mind let's go of the fact the game is called ""Fallout"" and start playing the game for what it is there's definitely a shift in enjoyment. Like all good RPG's, creating a character and building it up is endlessly satisfying... You can't really do that in 14 hours (on your first character anyway)... Builds in this game don't actually get completed until the high 70's, and it's after that the world really opens to all the events, trading and other things you can do to further your build. Again, not saying your wrong in your initial impressions, they're actually pretty standard these days, and I'm not saying the game becomes flawless after awhile because it certainly doesn't... But it does take on a life of its own after awhile."

It's impossible to permanently screw up a build in this game, but it can be grindy to fix it depending on how far out in left field it is. The general consensus on any build however is to minimize quality of life perks in favor of damage and defensive perks.

As far as water is concerned, you should get plans for a purifier fairly early on from one of the overseers chests. Build a camp with several of them, I have three at my camp and it's more than enough to keep me stocked. You also get water as a reward for almost every quest and event. For food, that gets easier with time, especially after getting the carnivore mutation...
