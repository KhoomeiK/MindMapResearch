I don't mean to sound cruel, but it's the social aspect more than the connection that seems to take precedence when dealing with ""modern dating"". Just like other species, we humans rely on a connection, but once we've enjoyed the ""thrill"" of a ""link"", we pretty much turn to the next thing.

Modern dating sucks because we ignore base impulses. We're meant to have sex, produce young, and maybe, possibly find ""love"", but that can't be guaranteed. We choose the next best thing...settling with what will satisfy such mindsets.

Jackson, one of the framers of our constitution wrote in his letters that any type of unity could poetentially topple the system put in place. You can read his correspondence with the other founding fathers easily online or through the Library of Congress. Hell, originally people of the lower class weren't even allowed to vote! They didn't have the mindset to face such choices.

The one thing I feel they didn't plan for, was to see that division become so great, that it splits the ideaology into two permenant parts. That's what we have now, and if you know history then you know what that will lead to.

SuicideWatch,flgrprv,t1_flgem3u,1585149011.0,"I'm not sure where you live at, but not all psych wards are built the same. The commonly associated one is the place where you're heavily monitored, have to wear gowns and everything is based on a schedule. I went to one of them when I was younger.

The second time I got commited, the place I went to was much more relaxed. The first time I had to get the group I was with to beg to go outside. The second time, you could go outside any time you wanted, provided one of the workers went out with you. The place was called Beckett Springs in Ohio. 

You got to keep your clothes, there was a washer dryer setup on site. The place was a bit more lively as opposed to the sterile look of the old place I had been to. There was a schedule and you were required to go to some of the things on it, but mostly they let you do what you felt like (this concept was designed so orderlies could track what each individual was doing to better asses how to help them). You shared a room with another individual, you got three meals a day, but just in case you were still hungry (or suffered from body issues like anorexia, etc.) you could grab sandwiches and snacks from a ""community room"" fridge. There were games, and also movies and shows to watch. 

Come to think of it, the first place I went to felt like they forced you to change, whereas the second ward let you choose how you wanted to change for the better. I don't think they allow it any more, but when I was there they allowed you to smoke cigarettes as well. I don't smoke anymore and it's been 4 years since I've been there. Very accommodating staff, and a few of the staff like engaging with the people they're taking care of, not coming off as if they are supposed to.

I agree with everyone on this list: talk to a specialist. If they reccomend going to a psych ward, do it. Just look at your options available as to where to go. If anything, such a break in your normal routine will help you find a new path to follow. Hopefully one for the better. Best of luck to you."

I think part of the mentality comes from stereotypes. Like the whole idea that women are chaste, dainty, etc. but men are lustful, take what they want, etc. Obviously, this is a gross misjudgment, so it should be no suprise that women masturbate, fantasize, and enjoy the same pleasures as a man does. Why we don't cater to the fantasies of women could also be a result of our own viewing and how us men like what we watch. That is to say, a womans porn video might look exactly the same as a guys fantasy of a porn video but may be interpreted differently.

Either way, I wish there was more porn from the woman viewpoint, intrests, and fantasies. Might help me out if I end up having sex with a woman. Aat least then I could get an idea of what might turn her on, what she sees, likes, etc.

What I can tell you, strickly regarding your want to meet others, is try this website called Meetup. If you want to form close relationships thats how I do it. On Meetup you look for community events in your area. I don't know about Cowboy Bebop, but 1. That's a fantastic show, and 2. I know there are groups on Meetup who get together to discuss anime.

If you go too long without meeting others it really messes with your self esteem as well as your ability to simply talk to others. I know this from experiamce with an emotionally abisive ex who would not let me cultivate my own friendships. Finally ended that after 4 years but also lost the ability to know HOW to connect to others.

Community groups are a great way to share similar intrests. Then as you meet those in that community, such as on Meetup, you can find the individuals who satisfy your desire to hang out one on one. 

Also, when you meet someone in a community you want to become friends with, just explain why you want to hang out. I told a friend of mine that I get anxiety over meeting people, but wanted to cultivate relationships outside my current partner because I want some change up in thoughts and opinions. He simply said, ""dude I got you, hanging out with new people is rough, but I'm glad you did. Now ready to play Diablo?"" Been chatting away now for several months.
----‐-----------------------------------------

Sorry for that, I go on tangents online.

 In short: look for communities that share your intrest online, utilize Meetup for groups near you, go there, go there again, and again, talk one on one with individuals ypu connect with, get their number, ask to hang out.

Vent,fiazsx5,t3_f7djr4,1582311692.0,"One day you might go see a therapist. I tell myself all the time I will, but I still haven't. 

It does suck having that feeling though doesn't it; so ""ugh""? Don't know why I get that way, but I do. For me, it's the buildup of school, work, paying bills and rent, and constant insecurities about my boyfriend, but I know it will pass. Always does. Until the next time it flares up again.

Don't know anything about you, don't know why you feel depressed, but I do know there's something you enjoy. Do that alot, A LOT. It might not help you feel less depressed, but it could stave it off for awhile.

Other option is to reach out to community groups. Not here in the internet, but local clubs, fairs, or another type of community driven group. That ability to connect with others, even just small talk, always has done wonders for me.

Best of luck!"

Older brother got me this game, we played it hours on end. Really loved the music, that drew me in, he liked the effects and visuals. Now at 31 🤔 (hate being a year older) darn I just want to play!

Halo had a great story, great mechanics (graphics obviously), and just... all around AWESOME! Halo 2 i really enjoyed too, despite all the hooplah against the Arbiter (did we ever find out his name?). Learning about Covenant culture, improved game graphics, a side story with more secrets and learning, I thought it was great.

Then 3 came out, and just like the Harry Potter books (didn't get past Goblet of Fire; too long between books), I forgot what I enjoyed in that original trilogy. Still always wanted to know what happened to Gravemind though. I don't think he died at the end of the original trilogy."

Vent,fg0radl,t3_ew7x8k,1580413472.0,"Problem I have is people freaking out like it's a terrible pandemic. Influenza has infected many more the amount and killed about a third of those infected. This viruses (which is in the same lineage as the cold; has similar protein makeup) has only killed about 4% of those infected with it, far FAR less than what influenza has killed this year. Let's not forget the coronavirus is nothing new. If I remember from microbiology class it was discovered in the late 70's. Why people (especially of healthy ages 20-40) are going crazy is beyond me!

I feel for your anger especially when people cant tell the difference between Asian, Indian, MiddleEastern or Russian which in some capacity all share similar physiological features to Chinese. More so for the rascist behavior of putting another down. I'm sure if any virus started here in the US though, I would PRAY other countries would be making memes of my country for making fun of others in the past."

He's a fictional character, so keeping part of him looking like fiction as opposed to what was a cheap attempt at making him look humanesque did the character good I think. His hair's also darker in the new one.

Character looks much more like sonic then the first one. Still unsire of the movie, but given it was produced by those who made FF, I expect it will be an action movie with plenty of speed, action, with comedic parts spaced throughout (the majority done by Dr. Robotnik). I was actually pleased to see more of that character in the new trailer, glad to see Carey getting back to his 90's early 2000's roots."
