mentalhealth,fkkig6d,t3_fj1ay2,1584284755.0,"I actually face a similar perception for myself- self harm and self loathing. The pain from self harm is somewhat soothing. Like you feel pain to feel better.

Does it mean it defines you? No. Does it become a part of your personality? Possibly.

Moving away from crowds or trying to distance yourself from it only helps so much since it can feel it's a part of who you are.

I would recommend trying different ways to try cope with this, other than self harm. Maybe even a journal or voice notes. Something which one day, you can look back and be like ""damn,I made it out""

Stay strong. We care about you❤️
