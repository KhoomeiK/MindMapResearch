Prejudice is terrible, it makes people consciously - or even just subconsciously - look for these supposed flaws. It's a fly trap for confirmation bias and it doesn't help anyone, it only hurts those who are affected by it big time.

I myself have borderline personality disorder, so I kinda know how it is living with the weight of a diagnosis. I don't cut myself, I don't ruin my relationships because of it, I don't manipulate people into not leaving me. 

Before I was diagnosed, I was already pretty sure I had it because I had related a lot with a friend who's also affected. My psychiatrist warned me of having a relationship with her (bruh) just because I told him she had it. ""They're unpredictable"" he said, told me I definitely didn't have it because it's ""more common in women than in men"". 
First time I talked to a therapist, she told me I had a personality disorder. Less than a week later she properly diagnosed me with BPD.

Mental illness and disorders are just names so professionals roughly know what kind of struggle you have and what kind of therapy might help you. 

In public perception, on the other hand, it's a specific trait with little variation that those affected are reduced to as a human."
