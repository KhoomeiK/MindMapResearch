Plato is not systematic. Neither were Nietzsche, Kierkegaard, Mainlander, Dilthey or the second Heidegger (after his Kehre). Deleuze, Derrida, Foucault, Nancy, Vattimo... Are anti-systematic in my opinion.

I don't consider analytic philosophy as real philosophy, so I ignored all of them. But I guess you could consider Russell, Frege or Wittgenstein as systematic too. 

I could keep the list going...

Anyway, I think the most systematic but at the same time deep philosophers are Aristotle and Zubiri. Husserl gets second place. Ive read it all from them, best stuff we humans have written in my opinion.
