fightporn,fp23jmh,t1_fp1zyy4,1588254413.0,"A suplex can turn someone into a quadriplegic. Wrestling and Judo takedowns are great for self defense but it doesn't absolve you from moral or legal consequences. Hard to justify paralyzing someone when you weren't trying to remove yourself from the situation and did the monkey dance along with your assailant. 

Having someone land on you during a throw can be brutal if you're not used to it, and more so if it's on fucking concrete. And that's just your back, hips, and shoulders, not even counting if your head bounces off the pavement or strains your neck. 

Even people who train can lack control of the situation. Sure, he ""protected"" himself but he also could of vegtablized the other kid for something small. The most standard hip throw without landing on your opponent can get someone off of you and allow you to run away without seriously hurting your attacker. In moments of self defense it'll be hard to gauge in split seconds what is the least injurious thing to do, and you could argue such a thing shouldn't be considered when your life is at stake. But for stupid ass school yard fights such as this, you really should show control. Which that kid didn't have at all. If the other kid was bigger than him you could have more of a case for suplexing him, but he wasn't. 

In his defense, it doesn't stop his attacker from catching him with a haymaker and knocking him out, causing serious brain damage or death when his head hits the concrete. It's almost as if you should pick the fights you get into. Wrestling is great but they don't teach you how to have a cool head."
