That's really mad I know, almost makes you think, ""do you know what's real."" Nevertheless it doesn't mean your suffering is any less real, the mind can play tricks, forget a name here or there or misremember certain details. Sometimes from experience my flashbacks and night terrors seem very different from what I thought they were like. It doesn't make my PTSD less valid or my mind less broken. All it shows is that I'm struggling rn and just need help like I believe you do x"

To answer your question yes it's perfectly natural for you to feel very low and vulnerable after being treated and encouraged to go through these experiences you've gone through.

ptsd,fq1uhcl,t3_gghq50,1589049517.0,"Painful flashbacks are part of the course for recovery I had to go through. It sounds to me that you're just starting your recovery which was just terrible for me. Alot of people with PTSD report a low appetite and general nausea myself included. I ate very badly and slept terribly for over a year but you've got a councillor in place which is something I've had to struggle with for years. 

Something I would advise is try and eat something even if it is once a day even if it's something small like a dry muffin or toast. Even if you go to a local corner shop and get something small to take away it will help. Flashbacks and even loud noises were a real trigger for me personally so try and fill your day with quiet sounds wherever possible. Nap when you can and remember to be good to yourself with a treat for getting through the day. Believe me it helps x"

ptsd,fpteywa,t3_gf3iel,1588890027.0,"Nightmares and night terrors are a big part of my life at the moment. The main thing I advise is that you make light of them whenever possible. Mine for instance involve me being held up by my throat or that I'm somehow going to be shamed to death. When you are awake if your mind is drawn back there look for the silly inconsistencies of dream logic that thing B was impossible to happen from thing A. That these dreams are often so predictable and laugh at them. Also if they are reoccurring dreams be aware that you are dreaming (if you can) and wake yourself up or change the decisions in your dreams where possible.

I also got myself to the drs and literally cried on them because of my night terrors and I was only getting 3 hours a night and maybe an hour nap in the day. Tell people what your going through and reach out like your doing now.

Now after 4 or so years I'm doing ok and although I get nightmares and night terrors most nights I know they aren't real, each night is a new night so it doesn't bother me too much in the day. X"

ptsd,fptdjok,t3_gfaf1g,1588889285.0,"I get nightmares and night terrors often. I've had them on and off coming up 4 years now and they are particularly bad these days. I've got used to them over the years particularly with medication. 

The first thing I managed to do was down play them to reduce the anxiety. This takes a ridiculous amount of effort in the beginning especially because they put you off sleeping altogether. You have to try and strip the serious elements away so in my case I am being attacked and or choked. For me I made fun of the dream elements such as oh yer I'm on my own in my room and someone appears that's just not logical or  more directly if I was having a flash back of a choking dream, I'd say to myself ""choking how original."" If you are being drawn back to your dreams find an inconsistency and make fun of it or if it's a reoccurring dream find something to remember your in a dream and do things differently. It's hard to do but very possible.

If it's affecting your sleep take my advice and visit a doctor when I was really suffering for about 3 weeks with brutal sleep. Waking up self harming and screaming the place down I went to the drs and literally cried on them and them helped. I got better medication and was told it was the right thing to do. It is always helpful to reach out which is what you're doing here.

With practice, right meds and years of experience I know my dreams are just dreams each night is a new night. I know I'm likely to have a night terror but there annoying and are one experience of many I have every day and night. Sometimes I have nice dreams often not but again they are just experiences."

Nothing (personally) I don't think will make them go away forever but I've found it's how I cope with those feelings that make the difference. I used to turn to alcohol and drugs and that really didn't help. Now when I have a flash back or a night terror I talk about it with my family or rationalise it in my head.

ptsd,fptaiqb,t3_gfehad,1588887742.0,"I've been like that before now. Luckily I've lived with family while going through my ptsd and in the first few years it's been really hard to eat. You no matter what you've gone through no matter how awful you are or see yourself deserve to eat. It got to the point where food was hard to eat but I enjoyed eating. Often I don't feel like cooking but even in my worst moments I try to remember to eat once a day.

Once a day even if it feels like a drain or it's totally decadent is better than not at all. You deserve to be here because you're reaching out and want to get better. Rebuilding a life after a traumatic period is hard work especially with the horrible world outside.

I advise you use this time to read broadly look at various different faiths, ideas and belief systems. One good book I've recently re read is Essays on a Polytheistic Philosophy of Religion. I certainly enjoyed  it  and I don't agree with Butler all the  time or everything he writes. 

He writes simply and any intelligent person should be able to understand it."
religion,fp9qf5j,t3_g9n7f0,1588432358.0,"For me personally or polytheists in general?

For me personally I'd describe myself as a soft polytheist. In my understanding I believe that the Gods have individual characteristics and souls which can be uncovered through myth, legend and experience. I also believe that they have a soul like we do and the soul comes from ""The One"" a concept found in Neo Platonic philosophy. Personally I worship the Norse Gods and operate within that belief system as it ""clicks"" with me more.

For Polytheism in general it can vary with each interpretation having a different set of problems. Very few Polytheists are what I consider as Hard Polytheists that their Gods are literally true and that they only they exist. There are Polytheistic Pantheists who believe that the Gods are more aspects of divine forces. 

There are many different interpretations along the polytheistic spectrum and if you put 10 of us in a room you will get 11 different answers."
religion,fp9p6kz,t3_gaaaeg,1588431587.0,"There are many religions if read in a certain way can offer a socialistic view of the world I work with a number of Christians in the UK labour party. For them their socialism is inspired by Jesus' help of the sick which for them means they should try and heal the sick too, through an NHS. Interesting when it was first founded it was sold as a work of positive Christianity. Also they advocate higher tax rates and poor relief because ""it's easier for a camel to get through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter heaven."" They are a great bunch on the whole and certainly interesting to hear their perspectives.

My Paganism also inspires me in my socialism as the ancient people of the north were community oriented group of people. For me ideas of community means speaking up for those who society who can't speak for themselves. It means feminism as both the Gods and Goddesses rule the heavens. It means listening to women and girls and understanding their experiences. For me it also means that my socialism has a strong environmental focus. Many in my community see their Gods in nature and it's possible to interpret the Gods as universal forces, so it means respecting and preserving the environment we live in."
