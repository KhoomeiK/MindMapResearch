>Defend a corporation you have nothing to do with in the same way that a 3-year old defends their mommy.

I'm not defending any corporation. I haven't liked a game that Square Enix has released in probably 15 years. I absolutely detest the compilation of FFVII that I think has irreparably done damage to FF7's legacy, and generally consider Tetsuya Nomura a hack fraud who got lucky because he had a few good ideas at a time where Square was looking to promote inside talent. I am under no obligation to shill for their new game.  

You're the one suggesting that Nomura, Nojima, and Toriyama should have compromised on their vision for the game because it might have upset your own personal demographic and potentially lost them money (and will, in the future, since you've all decided you're not buying part 2). If anything, you're the one arguing that corporations should prioritize profit margins over the art and I find that argument really fucking dishonest tbh."
StarWarsBattlefront,foryvth,t1_foqqpca,1588020924.0,"I'm watching Clone Wars for the first time and I just finished the arc where Maul seizes control of Mandalore. He's so fucking cool in Clone Wars. I cringed back in 2011 or whenever when I heard they brought him back because it sounded like cheap famservice, but he really is amazing. He's a lot more multifaceted, his defeat by Obiwan gave him clarity and trauma in equal measure.  He went from an action figure in the Phantom Menace to one of the best villains in all of Star Wars.

I cant wait to see the final episodes depicting the Siege of Mandalore."
FinalFantasy,forw76k,t1_foruxtj,1588019582.0,">its a reasonable expectation that a significant part of your audience will be fans of the original, and consideration ought to be paid to what's being changed.

This is absolutely the type of entitlement I'm talking about. 

>Oh no, why didn't the company consider what *I*, personally, might want? Oh no what if I am not rewarded for my slavish devotion to the brand????

It's sad, and absolutely will stifle any sort of creative expression within art. You're free to not enjoy anything you want, but don't act like the developers have an obligation to pander to you, specifically, quoteunquote real fans. 

It's a sad state of affairs when fanboys crying enough on the internet can steer the ship creatively, see Star Wars and the DC film universe, which regardless of how you felt about previous films in the series, the following one was an unholy mess of fan pandering because the filmmakers were so afraid of having any sort of coherent vision and instead focused entirely on pandering to crybabies."

FinalFantasy,foqmmln,t1_foq3t79,1587996832.0,"I'm not a fan of the ending tbh, it completely contradicts the original intent of Zack's death in the original. In the original game, Zack dies like a dog because he tried to help a stranger. It's not a glorious last stand, it's tragic and heartbreaking, he doesn't get accepted into Heaven because he was such a good boy, he dies face down in the mud with no one to remember him. There's no sappy passing of the torch where Zack gives the Buster Sword to his bestest friend in the whole entire world, Zack has been dead for hours by the time Cloud wakes and he's so overcome with trauma he fucking steals it from Zack and starts pretending to be him. 

Basically, Zack's death in Final Fantasy VII was genuinely meaningful tragedy, in Crisis Core it's shallow comfort food."

My issue is that it felt like they didn't properly develop that storyline and were trying to write out Hux as quickly as possible to replace him with Allegiant Generic Tarkin Clone because people cried Hux wasn't le epically badass enough. Hux was an actual character with personality and relationships to the other characters, 

Pryde is just...nothing. All he does is stand around and grimace, I can't tell you anything about what that character believes or what he represents other than that he's old guard Imperial military, but even someone like Captain Kennedy at the beginning of the Last Jedi did a lot more with less screentime. Maybe they could have developed a power struggle within the First Order now that the leadership of Supreme Leader Kylo Ren is questioned with the return of the Galactic Emperor, but every interesting idea in Rise of Skywalker is immediately discarded because we need to jump to the next bang-zoom epic action setpiece in our ADHD-riddled MacGuffin Hunt adventure."

The original game is still there and holds up immaculately in my opinion - I never felt like I needed the same game again with ""better"" graphics (The original FF7 has better art direction than the remake by a fucking mile) so I'm more willing to accept the direction they're going in."

At the same time, I am very worried about Nomura's flaws as writer - his absolute refusal to *ever* let characters die (especially when the permanence of death and feelings of loss that come with it were so core to FFVII as a narrative), his incessant need to constantly invent retcons for the sake of some shallow plot twist that just keeps making the story endlessly more convoluted - causing the direction of the Remake project to crash into a fucking wall.

They could very easily screw up future games, but for now, I really love what they did with this game as a singular product."
