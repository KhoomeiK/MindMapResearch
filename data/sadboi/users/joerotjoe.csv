SuicideWatch,f8colyn,t3_dxkhm6,1574465105.0,"You've articulated what my issue with suicide is. I'm in my early 50s and have pretty much accepted that my life is not going to get any better. I work like 16 hours a day just to keep above water, haven't taken a day off in more than 11 years, not a single day, because I'm a freelance writer and I always have to take on work even if it is just writing a business email for someone for 20 bucks.

And in my case, I have suffered depression for my whole life and have no resources to get therapy.

And seeing Trump get away with being the most criminal president in our history really eats away at me. 

I dream about suicide, I think about it all day every day every hour.

I hope I have the courage soon."
