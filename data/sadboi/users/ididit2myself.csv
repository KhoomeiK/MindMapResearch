AskReddit,fn7bqdy,t3_fzncbg,1586717189.0,"One of my last memories of my dog before he got killed by a car. He was a pitbull I got from the shelter as a young teenager, and honestly my parents had no business getting a dog as they weren‚Äôt decent people and they didn‚Äôt take care of him at all. He pulled endlessly whenever I tried to take him for walks and it got to the point where I just stopped trying. One day after school I noticed him sigh loudly on the floor and I could just tell that he felt depressed. I decided to put on his leash and get on my bicycle. I rode fast so he had to run along side me, dogs barked at us and cars whizzed by but he paid no attention to them. We rode all the way to a park and along a trail and it began to rain on us. When I looked down at him he had the biggest smile on his face. He was hit and killed by a car a few days later, but I‚Äôll always cherish that one memory I got to have with him."
