The fact that his parents asked ... is just plain weird and a red flag in my book. If he has told them this personal and private information then what will he tell them when or if you do start having sex?  

     In this sex obsessed society where you‚Äôve almost expected to have sex when your a teenager . Sadly virgins can be looked down upon or like they are a oddity . You have every right to feel the emotions that you do. He did something immature and childish. 

      I would consider having a conversation about his actions and how they made you feel. Come to a agreement if some sort and decide if you wants to give it ago . If you feel like this is something you can‚Äôt get past then it‚Äôs your choice."

You have to take care of your needs and sometimes it‚Äôs just easier to do yourself then have sex.  It‚Äôs not like your choosing it over her, you have sex 1-3 times a day.  

        There is a danger having sex when someone isn‚Äôt in the mood. It can cause resentment and a hole host of other issues. OP I‚Äôd advise asking her why she feels uncomfortable and go from there. As she sounds insecure."
