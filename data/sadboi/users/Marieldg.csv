Making distractions also works for me, i got new hobbies, read a lot, Netflix can be my best friend and i become a cooking goddess."

I haven´t experience any hair lose but i have notice some weight gain. Overall i find that i am more stable than i have been in years, no suicidal thoughts, no crazy shopping sprees."

Are you very far from the border? It might sound crazy to travel to another country for a test or treatment but it sounds like you really need to discard any other neurological issue."

He says that even asking for it is like pressuring me. Also he doesn’t want to be begging for sex, he says it makes him bad; “i know it’s not correct but try to understand that it makes me feel undesired if i ask and you say no”. This situation stresses me even more because i have to decide to wait until I truly feel like it or lie again. But i also understand his position and this is the only thing he has asked of me in regards of my illness, he accepts all my ups and downs and it’s supportive even when i  know I’m acting crazy, he makes me feel validated and loved; so i feel like i should respect his request of not asking this of him.
I am just very frustrated with my body; maybe a change of medicine would help, i will ask my doctor."
