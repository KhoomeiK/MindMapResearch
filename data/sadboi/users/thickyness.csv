StrongCurves,fng0kb1,t1_fne797k,1586919522.0,You need heavy weight for size gains. Otherwise you get smaller if anything or stay the same but doesn’t mean it is a waste of time since maybe you won’t add any size but you will look more “toned”
StrongCurves,fndqip4,t3_g0yxn1,1586875567.0,I was hipthrusting over 200lb and never saw a size change only looking toned and even smaller since I lost fat. Until one day I decided to eat more calories and finally within 1-2 months I saw size gains. This is not a scientific approach since alot of literature says you can gain in a maintanence or even in a deficit but this is the approach that worked for me. I gained some fat too but I was able to lose it and was left with bigger glutes at higher weight and smaller waist.

xxfitness,fhrfxra,t3_f42f8p,1581825212.0,Bulking worked for me. Your squat and deadlift is amazing but the hip thrust is weak. I squat and deadlift way less and hipthrust 115kg I think you can push over 100kg if you really focus on it. Do you feel your glutes in the squats? During my bulk I also started adding bands to heavy squats and do a set of glute activation before my deadlifts try it out .

Bodyfat is tricky you might get there and not drop weight, you might drop weight but not be at 20% . For example I trained for 2 years without having a good program and my food intake was not healthy too . I was chubby at 5’4 around 132-138lbs . My bodyfat might have been around yours. This summer I dropped down to 120. Yes I got leaner and lost bodyfat and was very happy to see I have built some glutes even though my program was bad. I could also see my abs if I lay down and flex (full 6pack) however standing up I only had some outlines of the abs. I am pear shaped tho. Never tested mh bf% , I bet it is higher than 20% but I was happy with the result and it gave me enough motivation to keep pushing and fix my diet + routine .

StrongCurves,f6mgqod,t1_f6mg92v,1572972719.0,"I can’t say since I was at high bodyfat% for a whole year and then I cut down to 120 and I had all this muscle under the fat and they were now toned. However I only recently (4 months ago) started squatting again too, and as of this month I notice my legs (and glutes) gained even more muscle. However I don’t add any isolations for the legs,thighs since I don’t want them to grow more than my glutes . I guess since I am eating at maintenance I am also loosing fat when gaining that muscle and I didn’t increase in size in my legs only in my glutes. Edit:  Just keep workig out,eating protein and staying active ."
StrongCurves,f6meh23,t1_f6me7vg,1572971617.0,"Well no , I usually do the same rep range for every set but add more reps next week. That way I don’t progress in weight too fast since I find it breaks my form or makes me plateu . You can just keep adding weight every week and keep the reps the same too. But this is harder for me. For example I do 10 reps of 60kg this week, next week I will do 12 of 60kg. Then I will do 65kg for 10 etc."
StrongCurves,f6md97v,t3_ds0pdq,1572970953.0,If it is written 10-20 you can go higher in weight and lower the reps to 10 then go up to 20 and lower again or don’t go to 20 if you feel like you can increase weight sooner.

StrongCurves,f6a81lx,t1_f66xa4p,1572753184.0,OP can do some banded work from the link before each squat set + add a band to the squat if possible. This really helps me feeling my glutes in squats or whatever exercise.
StrongCurves,f6a7080,t1_f693fku,1572752784.0,"If you are eating good and increasing weight every week then you are doing it right! It takes a long time there is not set time period to see gains. I always feel that way still and then I notice gains one day when I wake up and a few weeks later I am once again in the mood of “other people have gains faster than me” . I mean keep doing what you are doing, muscle building is slower than a cut usually you just have to trust the process and focus on something else. Btw a training tip to make sure your glutes are working each set of an exercise is to do some activation banded work before each set for example glute kickbacks before squats then you rest and do some more kickbacks and squat again."
StrongCurves,f5zlxfc,t3_dpcfwb,1572580167.0,"You didn’t mention anything about diet? Calories? Do you bulk,cut,recomp? What is your weight and height? I never saw major results until I cut down some fat to uncover the muscles for example . Also some people can never build muscle on a deficit. And recomp (maintaining calories) is a slow process, you will see slight changes each month. If strength goes up - you are doing something right. Also what are your lifts? And never compare yourself to others, use them as a motivation. We all have different genetics,lifestyles,everything. Also these progress pics might be a few years apart but people can write whatever they want in here for whatever reason. Sleep and stress play a big role in building muscle too. So do not compare. I try to focus on my lifting numbers as small goals, aesthethics are the ultimate goal but adding weight to the bar is a small goal for every week that keeps me excited and motivated try it out."

StrongCurves,f5rxcs2,t3_doyvf2,1572405303.0,"It doesn’t matter where you feel it, it targets the glute max (whole butt).

Lean bulking is what I would do in your position. You are just lean. Just bulk and lift. Amazing body btw.

Also the gym is small and usually the people that come are the same ones so we see eachother and just say a quick hi with the person that corrected me. It actually makes the experience more enjoyable and made me more comfortable. It is all about how you take it. I wish someone notices my squat form and corrects something since that is a very important lift and also hard to master. You are lucky. Some people would never tell you anything and you will look even more “stupid” doing it wrong which is not important as much as that you could’ve injured yourself in the future if he didn’t point that out."

xxfitness,f2uf6un,t1_f2ti8kh,1570414958.0,"This is very true. However I am someone who was the exact same stats as OP and went down to 55kg. Yes my strength went down,after all I am lighter. Usually strength is relevant  to bodyweight, a 60kg squat for a 50kg person is not the same as it is for a 80kg person. So if you manage to lose weight and also lose strength don’t be disappointed it is simply not the same. Also when I was 65kg I was on alot of calories ,it was a huge surplus for me and that also plays a role in energy when lifting. On the other hand I was never able to do pushups at 65 kg , at 55kg I am able to do  a few. Of course I worked on it but I also worked on it when I was 65kg and was never able. When I lost weight I learned healthy eating habits and rebuild most of my strength back,I cared only for my hipthrust strength honestly. It went down by around 10kg and now it is back up and even higher. Can’t speak for squats and deads cuz I never did them back then. You can’t have both strength and a leaner physique,focus on one right now and the other later. You have your whole life ahead of you, no need to rush just start. And btw I think 1400 calories is low enough, during my cut It was even a bit too low for me but I made a goal for myself to do 10k steps everyday on top of 5 lifting sessions . My sedentary tdee is 1600 and I used around 1600-1700 to cut since I also started quite low like you (1300) but I was starving and ended up binging. I recommend you start higher but be consistent and eat let’s say 1600 every single day for 2 weeks,measure everything in grams/ml with a scale ,allow yourself some treats (small piece of chocolate etc) and count protein see how it goes for 2 weeks if you didn’t drop anything at all reduce by 100.

Your deficit aim is small tho so it is possible you are off by 200 calories or more it is also possible your watch is wrong."

And you can never be sure of calories, it is always an estimate . There were researches that even labels on food were wrong by a few HUNDRED calories. You can never be “exact”."

xxfitness,f0s5y0x,t3_d6dafu,1568899414.0,"I was same stats and looking back at my pics now, when I am 55kg and 165 cm (grew 2 cm from fitness at age 21 lol) I can tell I was quite bigger than I was able to see in the mirror. Anyway I would do whatever you feel like you would like. Recomp is an option, I tried it by staying at 63kg for 1 year and lifting heavy and I didn’t saw results until I cut down. But when I cut down I saw some muscles under that fat, however If I cut first and then focused on muscle I wouldve been better imo."
xxfitness,f0hoflu,t1_f0hlxb3,1568627064.0,Depends on experience. If you are a noob and have a perfect routine it is alot more.
xxfitness,f0dkq5d,t1_f0dcjfa,1568555352.0,I never said she can fix hip dips I just said to build quads and glutes in a reply of a comment that already mentioned she can’t fix them . And yes 1 lb of muscle throught the whole body will not be visible in big muscle groups as much as in small ones
xxfitness,f0cmga2,t1_f0cf3rd,1568542334.0,Build quads and glutes it takes time cuz you can only gain 1 lb of muscle per month in your whole body. Quads and glutes are big muscles 1 lb is not very visible so keep at it

xxfitness,ezz5kvq,t3_d2zs6e,1568280968.0,"I started with CiCO. I ate whatever I want just in a budget of certain calories (deficit) . I realised that eating a whole pizza to take all my calories is miserable and I was starving still remember that day. But I also realised that balance is key, I can have my chocolate but just 100 calories worth of it . I still do that but now I don’t have many cravings since I focus on 80% clean food I sometimes find I am not as hungry and just eat 100% clean . But If I want a cookie , I get it and just count it in my calories and move on. This is a proven, always works. Losing weight is about energy, about taking in less than you take out . So you don’t have any leftover energy to store as fat. That is the truth,everything else is just a distraction to help you achieve a deficit."

So you can imagine I never worked out on it. Time passed by and my period regulated, I was also less lethargic on it so I started slowly working in a few sessions. Now I can workout whenever I want . Took me 2 years and also working out really helped my period and good nutrition ofc."
xxfitness,ezmuuhq,t3_d1bhm9,1567997254.0,"I also have thick thighs. When I started working out I started by avoiding quad isolation exercises, I did SC which has squats in it and my legs didn’t grew. I actually went from 135 to 121lbs and ofc I lost fat all over my body + my legs. However , my legs are still the biggest part of my body (and my butt too), I don’t have slender legs and I know I never will. Many girls would kill for bigger legs. I just embrace it.  For example - https://www.instagram.com/p/B2Idv3YhDVF/?igshid=1e5ngae960b2t   She has an amazing physique.

I have quite strong abductors (and developed) but since I squat more of a wide stance with toes out , I usually get sore in my adductors when squatting which is the inner thighs. I doubt her outer glutes get sore from squatting. Neither strengthening them helps squatting TOO MUCH ."
xxfitness,ezbt0yu,t1_ezbs8dt,1567825003.0,Yes I am around the same height with much lower weight and cut on 1500 but can also cut on 1700 .

xxfitness,ez8997p,t3_d02bes,1567737282.0,"OMAD is not optimal for me too. I would pass out + strength in workouts is very important for me and should be for everyone that weightlifts. Anything that makes you weak (unless it is a temporary cut) is making the process kinda pointless to a point. I can even increase weights on a cut but never by eating 3000 calories in one meal. I actually have the most progress eating 5 meals a day ,each containing some protein no need to be alot. I guess If you do it for a few years your body will get used to it but for me it wouldn’t be worth it, I am not a caveman ,I just pay for a gym membership and workout , I don’t try to survive like cavemen did."

Not as effective as doing what I can with good form. The muscles don’t care about the number I lift,they care about being challenged. I see people deadlifting way more with less gains than me and people deadlifting as little as 30kg and that particular girl trains for 5 years I think,she has amazing legs! I mean why do you care about the number? Focus on form."
