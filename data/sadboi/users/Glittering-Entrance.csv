It sounds like she has a really independent spirit and really likes having a place to go when she needs to be alone. I mean, as long as she’s not screwing around with someone else in said place.  But also you have every right to have that boundary and say “sorry that doesn’t work for me”. It wouldn’t fly with most people. There is also a slight chance that she’s not that into the marriage any more and isn’t sure so she wants to have her cake and eat it too and string you along. Which is obviously not cool. If she is still having cycles where she wants to move out and leave you, it sounds like her meds aren’t working and she needs to try something else. I went through so many cocktails of trial and error to figure out what works and it’s an ongoing battle. Does her psychiatrist know she still does this?"

We both recognize that. We get along now and we still have love for each other but to be perfectly honest, he’s still very selfish and it still gets on my nerves. I’m doing 90% of the parenting and he just spends time with our son when it’s convenient for him. He won’t stick to a schedule, he refuses to commit. Everything has to revolve around his schedule when he feels like doing something. He’s just that kind of person. I’m struggling a lot and battling mental illness and I’m in therapy and on medication. He has never once asked me how I’m doing or if I need a break. It just doesn’t even occur to him to ask or care. But I still love him and I refuse to fight over shit with him. I’m done fighting.

AskReddit,fpk102z,t3_gdxs5b,1588685771.0,White chocolate isn’t even chocolate. It’s just cream and sugar. I prefer dark chocolate or white chocolate if I want something sweeter. Never been a fan of milk chocolate.
AskReddit,fpjznoy,t1_fpim5t0,1588684925.0,I have a boy and I wish so bad I could have had another kid and it be a girl just because of all these awesome changes and awareness now. I love it. I would give anything to raise a confident girl who is comfortable with her body image and her period and will know what a clit is when she is a preteen and can say the word without turning beet red. The best I can offer society is raising a son who is respectful and educated about women. He’s 5 and he already fully understands what a period is and that it makes mommy really tired and cranky every month and that it’s nothing personal.

Parenting,fphkewi,t1_fph3nku,1588622833.0,Omg. A cake. I’m definitely doing this.
Parenting,fphk9tq,t3_gdff93,1588622761.0,Fuck. Summer camp is cancelled? I’m scared to ask where you live.
