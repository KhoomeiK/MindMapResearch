I have two cats, both were rescues. Our female was about 8 weeks old when her mother abandoned her outside, so we took her in. She’s been neutered, but she screams a lot at the door because she’s a brat and wants to go eat grass. We’re not sure if our male cat was an indoor or outdoor cat when we got him, but he was about 4 weeks old at the time. He was also neutered, and he couldn’t care less about going outside. He’s terrified of it, but if his sister is outside he’ll stick his head out to watch. He only screams when Mom is in the basement or he caught a pipe cleaner and wants everyone to know.

I’d highly recommend getting your cat spayed if you can figure out how, because it’s more humane and safer for the cat. It reduces the risk of testicular or prostate cancer, reduces the urge to mark territory, reduces aggressive behaviors between males, and will keep the stray cat population low. The last one is more important for males because one male can impregnate all of the female cats, and suddenly there’s dozens of kittens. One female can thankfully only be pregnant a couple times per year. If this is something that’s been causing problems and your parents noticed, might I suggest a PowerPoint about the benefits of spaying, especially young? I’ve used this technique a couple of times, and my parents seem to appreciate that I’m taking responsibility for the animals, am doing research, and feel strongly enough about the topic to want to respectfully talk about it."

We did separate them for about a week and then slowly started allowing Piper to go upstairs just so they could see her from the bedrooms. After about two weeks we let Piper have free reign of the house which means the cats no longer have a single room they can hide in, but they do have furniture that Piper isn’t allowed on, so they’re still separated. And most of the time they’re not in the same room. It’s just getting frustrating that the cats haven’t came downstairs in three months, and they get territorial when in the same room with her.

And yes, I imagine that they have been grieving Chloe as much as we have. Sometimes they’ll go wandering around the house, crying for her and looking at where her beds used to be. I played a video of her for them two weeks ago and they peeled up and we’re watching intently; it was heartbreaking. I wish there was a way I could make it easier for them, but I think 3 months is long enough to hate Piper for “replacing” Chloe and they need to start adapting."
