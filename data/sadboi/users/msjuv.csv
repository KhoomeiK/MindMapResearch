datingoverthirty,fkido0e,t3_filzw8,1584217559.0,"""...But even though I am making steady proclamations about who I will go for next, and why, and how it will all be different, it is brutal to imagine the idea of meeting a new person. Going through the same routine. Saying the same phrases I have now said many times: the big statements, the grand revelations about my childhood and character. The cautious revealing of insecurities. I have said them already, and they sit now in the minds of those people who are out living lives I have no access to anymore. Awhile ago, this sharing was tremendous; now, the idea of facing a new person and speaking the same core sentences seems like a mistake, an error of integrity. Surely it is not good for my own mind to make myself into a speech like that. The only major untouched field of discussion will have to do with this feeling, this tiredness, this exact speech.

The next person I love, I will sit across from in silence. We will have to learn it from each other some other way.""

datingoverthirty,f8w48iy,t3_e2atnz,1574882992.0,"OP, let me tell you about my recent experience. Met a guy online while abroad, texted every day for about 3 weeks. Met up when I got back. The date was one of the best dates I’d ever had and he said he felt the same. He had a lot of “work success” going on at that time, but we met again that same week and again had a great date. The third date was amazing too, we both seemed interested and happy to have found each other. 
Then he thought some silly text from me was a bit too pushy (I asked him to confirm we are meeting that week and used the “I have shit to do, can you let me know already”), I explained I didn’t mean to be rude and he seemed cool about it, then used the “I’m overwhelmed with work stuff now, let’s just chill for now”.
I was expecting to “chill” for a week, but he contacted me again in a couple of days asking how I feel “about us”... And so started the back and forth of “I really like you, but I’m SO overwhelmed right now”. Whatever the fuck that meant.
Long story short, he has mental health issues and was overwhelmed by work and didn’t understand why I really liked him. Had a lot of past insecurities to still work through, and having recently realised he’s not in fact ugly (something he believed for years) was too much for him. I am a complete opposite: if I like someone, me liking them is so rare and even more important than them liking me, so I’m very open with my feelings. I told him I liked him (because I did, a lot) and will be okay to wait until he is better. He said he still liked me too, but “felt overwhelmed”, so I just took it as you are doing with this girl - as being not interested enough. So after days of torture and texting back and forth like stupid teenagers, we ended it for good. 

My advice to you would be to first of all think whether you want a friendship/relationship with someone who is that mentally weak. I know I’ll get a lot of hate for saying this, but hey, I was hurt too and I don’t believe my date should have entered the dating scene in his state. 
Obviously be kind to her, no one knows what she’s going through, but don’t forget to be kind to yourself. All the best."

You are in shock, then your heart will start to feel all kinds of things while your mind tries to keep your sane. There will be regret, sense of loss and helplessness. Cry if you feel like it, it really helps. I lost my dad last Friday and I could not really cry until yesterday. Everyone is different and you will process this in your own way. Be kind to yourself, this is something you couldn’t have seen coming and he wouldn’t want to see you blaming yourself for anything.

startups,f2zmhrj,t3_deqssc,1570530164.0,"First of all, you’re already a winner. Do you realise how many wantrepreneurs never act on their ideas? How many give up just because they received a single piece of negative feedback? How many find a zillion excuses like not having money to hire developers, not having a perfect co-founder, not having time/inspiration/motivation.
So you are already ahead of most of us, so congrats and be fucking proud.
Second, you are juggling studies and work. Just one of these is able to cause a burnout, so learn to take care of yourself: eat well, exercise, see friends, take regular breaks. 

It is normal to be anxious about your launch. Try to change the way you describe it to “I am excited”, rather than “I’m anxious/freaking out”. 

No one can advise you on what path to take, some are happy in safe waters, some need the crazy waves of the startup world. Just realise whatever you decide, you’ll learn a lot but will ultimately be alright in the end. I don’t mean necessarily wealthy or successful, but you’ll survive whatever life throws your way, because most of us do. 

To overcome the current state of mind, use the “What’s the worst that can happen” approach, by writing the worst possible scenarios down, and next to them - the way/actions you will take to resolve them. Write it all down, because just thinking about them will add up to your stress. You’ll realise that the worst that can happen is still solvable. 

And good luck, look after yourself, I’m rooting for you.
