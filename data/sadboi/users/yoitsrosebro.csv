OpiatesRecovery,f7q9eyu,t3_dxcdfk,1573960662.0,"so, look, science is super cool. Suboxone and the opiates you were on are different drugs that work differently in your brain. What's happening is they're giving you Suboxone to cover up the feeling of you detoxing from the opiates you came into treatment wanting to get off of. By the end of 7 days you won't become even slightly addicted to Suboxone. It will allow you to feel comfortable while jumping off of whatever you were taking without that being long enough to cause a secondary addiction. While it is still an opiate, it's an opiate that has a different mechanism of action. If you still feel bad when it's done, it will be mild, and it'll be because there's no sub to cover up what's left of your detox. It's true that sub (I'm on it at exactly a year now and it's horrifying) is a serious bitch to get off of but NOT when used short term like this. Be comfortable, you don't have to deny any more medication, and don't be afraid of Suboxone if you're using it for under a week and a half, maybe two weeks. Respect it as a drug in itself but in this situation you should just relax and let them make you comfortable. I promise that I wouldn't give this advice if I weren't 100% confident in it. Good luck, I can try to help if you have any questions, but really proud of you and I know you can do it."

opiates,f31ugqq,t1_f31nkzc,1570585085.0,"it's just the concept of taking a small amount of Suboxone at the first sign of discomfort. like say 2mg. then if you start to get uncomfortable which you probably will: do some h. full agonist. wait until you start to get sick again, take some Suboxone. do a small amount of heroin. wait to get sick again. Suboxone. this is over the course of 2-3 days even if you have the ability. it was researched to try to find a way to keep people constantly stable because precipitated withdrawals or even just any discomfort for a few days getting onto sub obviously deters people from wanting to quit or get on maintenance  whatever  eventually your body does get the Suboxone into it's system while the dope keeps you well, so when you're ready to stop the h your body is adjusted and accepting Suboxone as good enough replacement. 

damn another long boi. I really hope you're feeling better. did you get stable?"
opiates,f31i65v,t1_f30pqzs,1570576014.0,"dooood if you're doing this at least look into the Bernese (sp?) method and do a little research on using while on sub if you can. I would come off of Suboxone so hard when I'd relapse on heroin for a week or so at a time that as soon as I wasn't high anymore, so 3-4 hours after dosing my sub WD would set in and it made getting to 24 hours so God damn miserable this last time, it was horrible and scared the shit out of me and I'm not easily bugged. anyway, every day that you use, take . 5 of Suboxone still. seems crazy but if you start to get sick on that low of a dose for some reason you just do more dope and it will take you right out of PWD. every time I've hit PWD I have sure as fuck ran out and used and it's saved me every time to far, but overall, you will also have a WAY easier time inducing if you don't go back and forth. I don't know how much Suboxone you take on a normal day but as long as you're under even 3-4mg you can still get high. it'll be harder but .5 seems to be the right dose to keep you stable.

the other thing is make sure that when you are getting sick to get back onto sub, still wait as long as you can, but once you want to start dosing do .25mg-.5mg max to start. wait 40 minutes, do another .5. you'll know quickly if it starts to get worse but you'll only be at 1mg of PWD versus slapping fucking 8mg under your tongue and wanting to die. it's also not the junkie thing to do but if you can save yourself one shot or... dose/whatever for in case you do get sick getting back onto Suboxone your induction day you will be SO much less panicked about it. I basically refuse to try to induce without a dub or something now. 

I hope you get to enjoy some sober time and get the fuck out of hell for a bit. but if you can't I get it and hope this helps at all. I may just be repeating shit you already know, so I'm sorry if this is just useless walls of text but if I didn't know this info I'd hate that I didn't know I were missing it"

opiates,f232s5y,t3_dbfg1d,1569904072.0,"Oh my God. this sounds exactly like the time I almost killed myself years ago in my brand new empty apartment in Phoenix years ago, trying to get well 28 hours out by shooting Suboxone instead of doing a proper induction. I was inexperienced and because I had shot it in the past (knowing it wouldn't get me high, but I just ""wanted to make sure it got into my system"" and) I thought I was good to go. I spent the first hour in the shower, on my side in the fetal position with my entire body VIBRATING. I wanted to bend my arms backwards like the exorcist and kept begging my boyfriend to tell me how much time had gone by from behind the shower curtain because figured it could only last so long. Every time I'd hear him from the other room like, ""uh.... one minute?"" oh my God anyway yeah, time slows down when your bones trying to break out.

We were both still using at the time and even though he had dosed sublingually and wasn't nearly as bad, it was too early for him too and we were crazy fucked up.  We had no money and no car but we had met a new guy the night before who lived up the block. I called him and prayed he was your average pervvy dealer (he was, yaaaay /s), told him that my bf was at work with all of our money on him and that I had shot sub. He let me come by and grab a dub but I think I almost passed out at least 20 times just waking the 40 feet to the train because there was no way in hell I was walking that whole half a mile. 

anyway the moral of this comment is please don't induce Suboxone iv, never ever ever never.  I really was just trying to say that I know EXACTLY what you meant by that buzzing and I remember thinking that getting that sick that quickly could probably send you into shock and kill you, which I prayed for the entire time.
