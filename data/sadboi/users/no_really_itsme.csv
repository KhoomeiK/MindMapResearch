We did prescribed steroid creams to get it under control (bleach spots eventually went away- 5 now). I tried everything under the sun and it was the only thing that actually worked. 

If you have access to a chlorine pool or hot tub I would suggest trying to get in a couple of times a week- we found that really helped. 

Now we do Cerave healing ointment (blue Tub) after showers and a steroid cream for spot treatments. Tends to keep it under control.

Taking care of your skin is key- good skin I feel like makes us happy on the inside and shows off your natural glow! Then Compliment it with some simple makeup - brows, mascara, and a good lipstick should be your go to to enhance your natural beauty!
Take care of your hair with a good cut and style and find an easy routine that doesn‚Äôt take long ( sorry mom mode now lol ).

As soon as I had my son, I feel in love all over ago and enjoyed the moments we spent together throughout the night because I knew it was our last child and I wouldn‚Äôt get to have a tiny human to hold after him. It was the best quiet time that we would get to spend together, just him and me.

With my daughter I would have anxiety thinking about how much sleep I wasn‚Äôt going to get... the change in mentality this time really helped me get through the first couple of months.

Everything else you just try to work out a new routine that works for the family. Your daughter can be big sister and mommy‚Äôs helper! My daughter loves helping around the house with little things like grabbing diapers/ wipes, change of clothes, or just entertaining him and he is just over the moon about her. That alone can give you a break when he‚Äôs a bit older too and give you 5 minutes to yourself. Give her time of course- my daughter wasn‚Äôt thrilled when he came home but after a while she warmed up to him and enjoyed helping out. 

Just find your new normal and cherish all the little moments! It‚Äôll take time but you got this! Sending you encouragement and cheering you on!"
