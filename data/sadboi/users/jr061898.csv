Sure, but Goku (and Piccolo) were able to feel Shin's power when they first met, which implies Gods don't just have only God Ki and have regular ki too. And in Super, other non-God characters can still feel Goku's and Vegeta's ki when they are not in the God forms. Plus, given that Buu is not an actual god, he probably has regular ki too.

That said, this is a retcon caused by adding God Ki as a measure of strength in post-BoG Dragon Ball. And given how much Buu's power fluctuates in the Buu saga, chances he didn't knew how to access it if he even knew he had it at all."

Yes. Because in Superman-related media Earth's Sun is referred as Yellow and the sunlight that gives him his powers is specifically referred to as yellow sunlight. I had no reason to say in any other way until you indicated the Sun (and its sunlight) in real life (not DC, mind you) is White. 

>And now you are saying that you didn't talk about it? 

Because that was a different topic (the topic being Superman's needs). The debate and respective topic (about RealLife-Sun vs DC-Sun) started when you added the RealLife-Sun to the conversation. 

>Byrne was not a scientist. He was good comic writer.

Which is the very reason I said people generally believe the Sun is yellow. I didn't excluded him from those same people.

>Not admitting ones mistakes and justifying them like you are, by using terrible reasoning which makes no sense, is a sign of arrogance.

You are not much better. You change the topics or add information which adds nothing to your point to appear more convincing. And to make matters worse, you are actively trying to devalue my own points and opinion with no real justification (your reasoning being that my points are poor and hollow, but yours are far from better in that aspect).

And, you know, for someone who claimed ""I'm attacking the comics, not you"" it is pretty clear you are attacking me."
superman,fqb5w1d,t1_fqb0ohl,1589231126.0,">But different sunlights and their effects is not a different topic altogether. It's tied down to the reason behind his powers.

It is a different topic altogether because we were not (or at least I wasn't when I originally posted my reply) talking about the effects of White or Yellow sunlight on Superman (and Kryptonians overall). We were talking about the actual color of the sun and sunlight itself in DC-Earth's Sun when contrasted with RealLife-Earth's Sun. Said difference has no impact with how other sunlights affect Superman's powers.

>And why would it anger the fan base over such a minute detail? They aren't making any changes to his powers or personality. 

You would be surprised how ridiculous a fanbase can be some times. But yes, it is a minute, almost insignificant detail to the point that DC Writers have no real incentive to retcon it to make it more accurate because simply *almost* nobody cares about that. And if the change was indeed made, the vast majority probably wouldn't even care.

>Please understand. I am not trying to fight or belittle you. I love Superman as much as you do. I am only attacking the comics, not you.

I know.

>Retconning and Rebooting mistakes and outdated ideas has been DC's M.O. for decades. DC does not retcons than any other comic company and people don't get angered.

Yes, this one can't be argued.

>All I am saying is that you are trying very hard to justify a genuine mistake, but we have every reason to correct it without angering anyone. 

The thing is, I'm not trying to justify why they made it/keep it as Yellow even though it is supposed White. I literally never even thought about it until this thread, and I don't really care about it. The only reason I have even commented this far is because this went off-topic too fast and because you are treating mistakes as if they were the same thing as internal inconsistencies.

And for all we know it may not even be a mistake, they might have made it yellow because most people either believe or were raised to believe that the Sun is yellow."

The ""Yellow Sunlight"" it's basically just a placeholder to the sunlight of Earth's Sun or the same type of stars, as long as the sunlight is the same as our sun it doesn't matters how it's actually called.

Of course, the different sunlights do have an effect on Superman's powers. But that's a different topic altogether. And it remains consistent in the story, because the stories themselves treats it as Yellow.

So for sake of being as faithful to canon as possible, we should only count what is written by Toriyama himself (hence why it the anime adaptation of Battle of Gods should be considered as the canon one, especially because the manga too has its own adaptation of Battle of Gods).

And the only ones who got higher than her in that specific pool were: someone who genuinely deserved being Top 1 and someone who we see actually falling into villany in a very sad way. That means that it still is just a vocal minority.

Taking into account the actual amount of votes, that makes her the 3H character in the highest pool of any of these pools (outside Byleth), she got even Top 4 in The Most Graceful Dancing Duet alongside Dimitri (ironically, given that they never dance together)."

Worth noting too that so far Destructo Disc is among the most dangerous technique shown in the entire franchise. Since, outside non-canonical uses and filler, it has shown to be equally effective against all foes it has been used against and actually hit."

Most authors probably don't even think or care on the much darker implications of the CRA, which is why they are rarely ever discussed. Nor is it ever brought on that more than likely the clan survivor wouldn't even be able to pick their own spouses if the CRA was an actual thing.... Of course, the existence of the CRA in a more realistic writing implies that the clan survivor's compliance and well-being isn't considered a factor even if those dark implications were indeed acknowledged."

Well, one of the major differences with Rhea is that Edelgard does steps down of her Throne for a fitting sucessor, in constrast to Rhea who was the Archbishop for more or less a thousand years and only steps down after being tortured and punished made her realize the error of her ways.

And the very first thing she does as Emperor is to start to stop the corrupt nobles of the Empire, and ultimately getting rid of TWSITD after she no longer needed them, again in contrast to Rhea whom actively encourages a religious view of the Crest System responsible for many of the bad things in Fodlan in part for her own personal gain (though she did initially started with good intentions). So I don't see where is the proof that Edelgard is particularly incompetent in that aspect.

That being said. A major theme between Edelgard and Rhea is that both do mirror each other in many ways, so you do have a point."

That's its own thing, though it fairly obvious it's meant to mirror Naruto's Bijuu Avatar, but it seems to be more related to the Six Paths Senjutsu than anything else. At that time Kurama was very young, so it's extremely unlikely he already was inside a Jinchuriki. Not to mention by that time there was no need of any of the Tailed Beast to be sealed in a Jinchuriki to begin with.

In-universe, it's clearly the result of the way Naruto learned to harness Kurama's chakra: By separating Kurama's mind out of it and just taking the chakra itself. Which is partly confirmed by how Minato was able to do the same without apparently interacting with his half of Kurama. Notable too because Naruto is able to manifest Kurama in his true form (albeit, separated from himself), as demonstrated by The Last."

More or less, yes. The drawback was introduced solely to justify Naruto growing much stronger at a fast enough rate, but completely forgotten after that.

TWSITD sure did took a very heavy hit in AM, seeing how the lose their leaders and the major asset that was the Empire... but the Organization at large still is there and nobody knows about them. There is no indication that losing their leaders would stop them for long, it would just slow them down and forced to start anew. 

***However***, Hapi's ending in AM does solves this to some degree. Since she lets Dimitri know about them.

FireEmblemThreeHouses,fn6we4z,t1_fn6mxiy,1586708655.0,">knowing she's still working with corrupt nobles like Caspar and Bernadetta's fathers

As far as I'm aware, at no point Caspar's father was ever depicted as corrupt in any of the routes (and we even fight him, and he looks and acts a far cry of being corrupt). And Bernadetta's father is under house arrest, and the one currently taking control of House Varley is Bernadetta's mother. It is even a point that Edelgard and Hubert actively took down all the corrupt nobles of the empire (and the very first thing she did as Emperor was to put Ferdinand's father, a corrupt noble, under house arrest) so I don't know where you get the idea that she is working with corrupt nobles.

And part of the theme of the game is that almost all of the problems presented in the story could have been solved more peacefully if the Lords just tried to at least talk to each other, but for their own reasons they don't. And Edelgard was willing to ktalk* to the other Lords seeing how she send manifestos to all the nobles in Fodlan, the problem is she is not willing to *compromise* (which brings her to the most problem with, ironically, Claude in specific) with them.

Another theme is that literally nobody knows the whole truth and run based on their current beliefs (especially noticeable with Edelgard, whom does not seems to be aware of how important Crests are to the Kingdom's security beyond being just used to show superiority like in the Empire), with the only actively investigating the truth being Claude."
