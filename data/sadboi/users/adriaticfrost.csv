Anxiety,fov8fjz,t3_g9mpte,1588097078.0,"This probably won’t help, but I have the same thing happening to me. There’s honestly no way to prove that it’s not a simulation, but you can try to make the best out of it and appreciate what the “simulation” has to offer. Like when I’m breaking down and thinking everything is just computer codes and I’m the only self aware person, I just look at my dog and go wow I love this part of the simulation. She may just be part of a program but shes still amazing and my favorite part of it. Just because nothing is real doesn’t mean everything sucks ya know? As I’m typing this my brain is thinking “this is pointless because this person isn’t real.” But I’m doing it anyway because it’s a sad and scary life if you just shut everyone and everything out because of a delusion. Also getting absorbed into youtube or netflix helps!"
legaladviceofftopic,fno5oet,t1_fnlj6w5,1587113018.0,I agree but I don’t think I’m gonna be able to move out anytime soon since the world is kind of ending right now haha. I have no privacy at home though so how would I go about securing important documents and stuff? My parents don’t trust me with anything and have a habit of taking all the even slightly important things.

Thetruthishere,fmzz7sz,t1_fmwcsub,1586532470.0,There’s nothing too crazy. I’ve had entities drag me out of my body when im sleeping onto some weird in between the astral plane and this plane thing then try to do something to that projected consciousness. That was really bad wording haha. My dad has seen me go into my room many times and I just wouldn’t be there. When I was a baby I would stare at the corner of the living room for hours. I think I had a dark attachment for a while but I got rid of it.  There’s definitely more but my father has had crazy experiences. He’s claimed he’s broken aliens arms and stuff like that.

Thetruthishere,fmfbecr,t1_fmeen1q,1586023732.0,It looked the same as the real statue just tiny. My dad says he has seen many many ufos and has had encounters with extraterrestrials his entire life. He claims that I’ve been abducted too.

PRINCE,f8ym2xa,t1_f8yk0z7,1574949429.0,I usually only draw super masculine faces and super feminine faces so it’s definitely a challenge to capture someone who is all over the spectrum depending on the time/makeup/hair/lighting/photographer. The artist side of my brain finds his facial structure so beautifully sculpted and unique. I wish I could accurately capture him on paper in the way that my mind sees him.

PRINCE,f8ygfjc,t1_f8xypst,1574946816.0,Yeah there’s just minor details on every facial feature that are off. Like I think his nose has to be bigger and the eyes are too round and cartoony. Thanks for the feedback
PRINCE,f8yg1g4,t1_f8xv2n1,1574946626.0,Yeah every photo I looked at was so different! It looked like he had various makeup looks in some so his facial features weren’t consistent.

dogs,f8dqabh,t3_e07epw,1574504811.0,"My real dog’s name isn’t too clever, but I have a lot of plushie dogs with interesting names. There’s Tater Tot, Bottle Top, Charleston (Charlie), Jingles (has a santa hat with a bell on the end), Cheez It (my 8 year old imagination caused me to cut holes in a cheez it box to make it a wearable clothing item for him lmao)"
Thetruthishere,f8dpquh,t3_e095mq,1574503878.0,"A logical explanation to the dogs going nuts could be that there are animals that come out at a certain time of day. Every night just a bit after it gets dark, my dog growls and alert barks with her fur standing up on her back because she senses the fox or other night time neighborhood animals in the yard. The neighbors dogs are usually barking with her. I believe that they can sense what the other dogs barks mean so they all join in.  This may or may not be what happened in your situation but it seems similar to what happens with my dog. 

When I was younger my father and a few neighbors told me that there was an alligator in the storm drain and we used to put crackers out to feed it. I used to be scared to get too close so I always kept my distance to be safe. (There’s no alligators within at least 500 miles of where I live) Maybe the sprit could be something like the alligator.  So many people believe in it that it becomes a reality. 

I’m not saying this spirit isn’t real or anything because there’s definitely things in this world that we cannot explain and transcend human intelligence."

mentalhealth,f7xpis3,t1_f7xpc1b,1574068486.0,It’s not a crappy suggestion. I expected it actually and it does confirm to me that I do need to seek professional help. I’ve been begging my parents for months to help me and they just change the subject. Maybe there’s someone somewhere at my university that could help me.
RandomKindness,f7xo1ha,t3_dxy7xo,1574066272.0,Either would be greatly appreciated because my best and only friend is flying me out to be with her during christmas and I have nothing to give her.

AMA,f7naay0,t1_f7n9vj4,1573891937.0,"Not offensive at all haha no worries! The term furry is just a label that some chose to use on themselves. People can wear fursuits and have an interest in anthropomorphic art, and media and so on, and not label themselves as a furry.  In my opinion people who use the term furry in reference to themselves just want to be considered part of the fandom/community. For example the (now non existent) band One Direction has many fans and a huge fandom. Some choose to label themselves as Directioners and be a part of the fandom, some are just regular fans. It’s just a label one can choose to use to be a part of something. I did my best to explain my opinion of that lol I hope that answered your question."
AMA,f7n9hle,t1_f7n8tzc,1573890696.0,"That’s kind of a difficult question. I am not embarrassed to be one, and my close friends and family don’t care, but I tend to not tell many people because of the negative stigma around Furries. I don’t like getting negative reactions from people. Their immediate response is usually due to the stereotypes they know and their lack of knowledge of the subject. Many people just know furries as those sex obsessed animal people or whatever. That is definitely not who I am, and I guess I would be embarrassed if that’s what they automatically think I am. Basically I’m embarrassed of the stereotype, not of who I actually am."
AMA,f7n91zj,t1_f7n8p93,1573890044.0,"I’m pretty sure you mean wear a fursuit. I do not. I have attempted to make a fursuit head in the past, but it ended up being way too difficult to wear. I do intend on trying to make a full suit in the future though. I am relatively shy and do have quite a bit of social anxiety, so I’m not sure i’ll be running all around town as a huge dog though. But who knows what the future holds"
AMA,f7n8wdr,t1_f7n8oka,1573889808.0,I don’t think I do anything different than other people. Everyone has their own hobbies and interests and mine just happens to be furry stuff. I don’t walk around with a tail on 24/7 or bark at people. I don’t believe I’m a dog in a human’s body. I’m a normal person that just happens to like drawing animals with human traits.
AMA,f7n8obm,t1_f7n8k1j,1573889480.0,Because I have a passion for anthropomorphic animals. I like coming up with my own characters and it’s fun to draw myself as a dog. It’s just a hobby I guess
