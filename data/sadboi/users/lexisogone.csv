BreakUps,ew3i2ra,t3_cmdu11,1565079988.0,I think I’m going through the hardest breakup I’ve ever had. I appreciate this post and will definitely be looking back at it from time to time when I’m feeling down. Thank you so much.
AskParents,ev8e1ab,t3_cil9a5,1564276803.0,It was always crazy to my how much people are willing to invest in things like daycare and hobbies for their kids. daycare i understand a little more chase more essential so it sucks that it’s so expensive! I used to work for a swim school and parents were literally out here spending 100-400 a month for their kids to learn how to swim it’s ridiculous.
AskParents,ev8dnye,t1_ev0wgwm,1564276483.0,Wow I appreciate you so much. You know I’ve thought the same things. I wanted to get her a bunch of cartoons and movies from the 1990s Just to kind of give her a taste of what it was like for me as a kid and the type of shows we watched as a kids. Can I get a few of those names for the games you have him play! She sits in front of a screen for hours anyways so I might as well get her learning as much as I can
AskParents,euzqbdb,t1_euqfff9,1564124403.0,"Bullying wasn’t the problem, just lack of structure at home. I wondered the same thing for myself but when I ask her why she doesn’t like school she says she just doesn’t like doing the work. Which is sad coming from a 5-6 year old at the time. No ones corrected her to do otherwise but procrastinate and dislike work."
AskParents,euzpv99,t1_euqrcn9,1564124179.0,"I need to make a call. I figured for a while it wouldn’t eventually sort itself out. I’ve held back for a while because CPS or whoever, has been eyeballing my household already. My mom lied to our local school district and said my little sister “moved” when really they just pulled her out. Something seemed fishy to them but nothing came of it. My mom has specifically said, “I hope she(my sister) just gets lost in their system.” And I’m afraid she might have. And yes, here in Colorado, if my sister fails a standard test once she hits 3rd grade, they will automatically put her back in school like you said. But until then everything my mom does will go unnoticed. That’s why no one is fighting with my mom cause they assume it will be taken care of once that test comes. Why does it take her being an 8 year old kid to finally be corrected on not knowing how to read. By then it will be even harder on my sister to catch up and act like the rest of the kids."
AskParents,euoog3w,t1_euoihf3,1563944658.0,"Yes he’s apart of it. He’s wrapped around my moms finger. He literally just doesn’t care as long as my moms does what she wants to do. Me and my sisters grew up with a super dad thankfully. But watching my little sister breaks my heart cause she doesn’t get to experience what we did. And my mother is all of the above. She’s definitely a narcissist. She literally sees no wrong in what she’s doing and o think she just expects things to turn out fine because me and my sisters all did. That’s no thanks to her though, that was all my dad.

Edit: let me mention he’s my step dad Incase that was unclear sorry"
AskParents,euokz7y,t1_euoithb,1563943109.0,That’s the truth for sure. I think my mother feels as though she’s doing nothing wrong. She says things like “she’ll be fine.” “Your sister didn’t like school either and look how she turned out.” She doesn’t realize the severity of the situation.
AskParents,euokrtt,t1_euo6jhw,1563943030.0,I’ve never heard of compulsory education laws before I’ll definitely do my research on it
AskReddit,eucrtsw,t3_cflyop,1563684470.0,I had to quit my job because I was moving. My manager asked me what part of town I now lived in so she could mention me to her other business owning friends in the area. My family has always viewed me as “struggling” and “lazy” since I dropped out of high school. It’s nice to think my work ethic was noticed and is strong enough to be recommended.
Denver,et0gl6c,t3_c9o63k,1562378777.0,"Considering the airport is pretty far away from anything, it might be a bit difficult to find somewhere worth your time. There’s some interesting facts about dia itself though. If you look online you’ll find a bunch of stuff about its history and creepy conspiracies. Especially within the art installations. you can walk around to and see for yourself!:) safe travels"
getting_over_it,es0bc7a,t1_erztmce,1561471118.0,"Considering we don’t know the details, it’s hard to say his reaction was extreme. This also could have been fresh maybe he just needs time to heal or maybe he’s made a conscious decision and is choosing his way without her. No matter what’s everyone’s emotions are valid and no ones emotions should be called “extreme” Everyone has their limits and she accidentally exceeded his."
Instagram,ermzx7h,t1_ermwpcy,1561041368.0,Damn. Yeah Instagram got a little too wild with their ads for a while
Instagram,erm9fak,t1_er3m5j8,1561011335.0,Woah how does the algorithm work? That’s a really hard ratio to work with
Instagram,erm9c3b,t1_erixuke,1561011224.0,Lol u roasting me?!
Instagram,erhzsor,t1_erhzbgb,1560886437.0,Lol oh wow we are in the same exact boat
Instagram,erhxjao,t1_erhvuvy,1560885055.0,Did it randomly disappear for you too? I heard somewhere that people who had the problem had it because they were a business account. I am too so I took it off for a few days but it still didn’t show up. But some say that works for them so maybe try that if you’re a business acc!
gay,erd69ky,t1_erd4hol,1560732158.0,Exactly!!! He has an older brother (red healer wolf mix) so he’s the little bear of the family:)
depression,erd64i0,t3_c1e49o,1560732034.0,"Yes. I think it was one of my biggest symptoms of depression as it might be for others here too. Sometimes you can be in that state for such a long time it’s hard to remember what feeling genuine pleasure was like. Like feeling the warmth of the sun in your room in the morning, loving the taste of your meals and drinks. Hearing a song you used to love. It will come back don’t worry. I feel like I was in that state for months on end. Then one day, I woke up and smelled the rain coming in from my open window. I could have cried because I found myself genuinely enjoying that moment. It gets better. It comes and goes on and off but in all, the lengths of time that you experience anhedonia become shorter, and the times you find yourself enjoying things becomes longer:)"
gay,erct688,t1_ercq7h0,1560721285.0,Oh no ! Sad you missed it:(
gay,erch93m,t1_ercam2k,1560712100.0, he appreciates your sacrifice
gay,erc61dq,t1_erby4ee,1560703689.0,Red outback yes:)
Dogtraining,erb9jrz,t1_erb8xfc,1560667791.0,"Thanks so much for the advice! We’ll shorten the time we take away his bowl for sure. Ice is a great idea, especially if all he needs is a cool down. And yes he drinks a LOT of water through the day. It baffles me sometime like how can such a small thing be so thirsty haha"
depression,eqsvg38,t1_eqsq5fq,1560294867.0,"OP mentioned wanting to get pushed over the edge so they’d have the courage to kill themselves. If they ever find themselves over that edge, I’d hope the quote would come to mind."
depression,eqs3e0l,t3_bzc9jt,1560275795.0,"I saw this quote on reddit that read, “it takes a lot of courage to kill yourself. Imagine all the things you could do with that courage”  it touched me deeply, I hope it can do somewhat of the same to others."
getting_over_it,eqkgxo4,t1_eqk3sym,1560123008.0,Thank you so much. I’m only 19 so I’m very lucky to have been given the opportunity. I’m back here in Colorado now which is another reason I’m kind of bummed lately. I just want to be here long enough to make some money and move back. Hawaii is definitely a complete change of pace and exactly what I need. We’ll both get to where we need to be eventually! Just recently I’ve adopted the mindset of “life is fluid and you’ll never be stuck.” I don’t know if that helps you at all on your journey but I hope it does!
lexapro,eqjlip0,t3_byk93t,1560107068.0,"Yeah I felt the “high” side effects for while. don’t worry though, It’s just your brain adjusting to these different chemicals making you feel different things. I struggled with high anxiety and some pretty wicked panic attacks. I became extremely agoraphobic. My mind was always racing, and I always thought I was one snap from going crazy. After starting lexapro it definitely wasn’t a fix all, but it made everything go silent after those first two weeks of getting used to it. It gave me the time and the space in my head to finally start helping myself. I hope this little bit of my experience with it helps you a little. It will never effect someone exactly how it effects someone else, but from my experience, it helped me a lot. I hope you’re journey with it goes smoothly!"
getting_over_it,eqjkbpi,t1_eqigf8w,1560106385.0,You’re right. I’ve been in a good state of kind before and I’ll always be capable if going back to that happy place if I ever seem to get lost like you said. Thank you so much for your kind words. I appreciate the support so much.
husky,eqb01tq,t1_eqalnxd,1559942902.0,"The tail is similar to my purebred husky pup. When he’s relaxed and sitting, is tail looks similar. But when he’s up and moving, his tail turns into a little curly feather haha. id say if this pups tail always looks like that though, you’re probably right."
getting_over_it,eqaz68l,t1_eqami1j,1559942490.0,"I had a whole thing typed out and accidentally existed out of this app wow... but yes I appreciate you for talking about your personal journey anyone will be lucky to find your comment and read all of these hopeful words. 

Our stories are similar. I would describe my vices and habits the same when it comes to the way they are impacting my life in a variety of low, medium and high. I know what you mean when you say “the the dark” that’s the perfect way to describe it. It’s so comforting to hear other people say what I’m thinking when I don’t know how to put what I’m thinking properly into words. I’ll have to start celebrating my smaller accomplishments. Realizing when I’m “getting bad again” will always be the hardest. I don’t realize until I’m so deep into it I find it hard to get out until I just am out somehow. I understand the triumphs of seeing the stretches of wellness go for longer and the darkness being shorter. I have to start noticing it more for sure.

Thank you so much for your comment. It’s pinpointed a feeling I’ve never been able to explain thoroughly. I’ll be sure to come back to this thread because I lose my thoughts easily. Thank you so much."
husky,eqalqb0,t1_eqaeyxw,1559935398.0,Haha I’ll be sure to make a personal one for my pup!
husky,eqalkh5,t1_eqadw1m,1559935310.0,Malamutes are some gorgeous looking dogs. My childhood dog was a husky malamute. Haha I believe it. Koda can be such a sweetheart but such a little devil sometimes!
husky,eqa770n,t1_eqa0m83,1559926741.0,Thank you so much!! As cute as he is he can be such a pain haha I love him to death though
getting_over_it,eqa3gb8,t3_bxgn4z,1559924251.0,"For me, I was also very hesitant to start medication. I knew it wasn’t going to be a “fix all” but i figured I could only go up from where I was. after a week and some of feeling high and my mind feeling racey, I felt nothing,  but nothing was better than pain and loud thoughts. Long story short, It didn’t heal me, but it gave me one foot on the ground and the silence to finally be able to heal myself. I hope a little bit of my personal experience helps!"
