But the story really doesn't go anywhere until the last 3-4 chapters where it suddenly decides ""oh shit we need to make an actual story"". Where they then decide to actually create drama and intrigue before ending unsatisfyingly which I get is the point but so did Mafia 1 and that game is praised for it's story. Ultimately it was the connection between Joe and Vito that kept me playing the game. 


I thought the detail of the world was incredible and how they really transport you back to that time with the music choice, world design, cars, and etc. The shooting mechanics are easily the part of the game that has aged poorly. The shooting feels like using a pea shooter and the spread on the guns is ridiculous. This in combination with the fact that the game loves to take away your weapons and money and make you start from the bottom all over again. Having to use that pistol which can barely take someone out with a full clip was infuriating to say the least. This reached a peak in the dock shootout and the stairwell shootout. I may be terrible at games but when you get one-shot immediately going down the stairs, I don't think anyone could manage to avoid that even with super-human reflexes. 

I overall liked the game but I thought it was above-average, not a great game but definitely one I enjoyed my time with. Maybe it'll grow on me a bit more but I still overall enjoyed it. It's definitely worth checking out but I can imagine the shortcomings will grate on people, which is definitely how I felt towards the end. And definitely don't play on Hard."
