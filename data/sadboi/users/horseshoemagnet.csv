I know two other couples who won’t be having kids and if you stop thinking about what people will say you will be fine.

Feeling left out is a horrible reason to think about having kids. I don’t regret for a second that I went on this path of life and no amount of friends living a perfect family life can convince me otherwise. In the end it’s all down to you and your spouse (if married)"

ukvisa,fqy3ttn,t3_ghkrmb,1589742138.0,I am in exactly the same boat as you. My visa expires in November 2020 and my company is planning to sponsor General visa for me as soon as possible. Now I have asked them to wait until flights resume as CoS is valid for only three months. Once flights resume and Vfs applications start in India I will ask my company to prepare CoS.

ukvisa,fpi785z,t1_fp70x1p,1588635054.0,How are dependant visas treated in this case? My dependant visa is valid until 30th November 2020 but if I apply for a Tier 2 General visa will they consider mine as a fresh application or look at the validity of current dependant visa?
ukvisa,fpb6aro,t1_fpa6ly4,1588463016.0,"So at the time of application you will be asked for the CoS ID and that has to be valid is what is as per my understanding. Doesn't matter what happens after submission. When does your current visa expire? If it's sometime soon then making a CoS definitely makes sense. As then even lets say you get it by Mid May and its valid until Mid Aug and if flights still don't resume by then then this rule of applying within UK would be extended I guess and you would not have to go back to your home country to apply. But if there is time for your visa to expire and flights don't resume by then your CoS  would expire and they would have to re-issue it again. 

Visa application centres not working is not your fault - I don't think that would make an employer change their mind. If waiting for something saves their time and yours then I believe you should be transparent about it and let them know. Good luck"

I am on a dependant visa at the moment which expires at the end of the year however COVID situation has brought a lot of uncertainty for my spouse hence I am asking my employer to sponsor a visa right now because if my spouse is asked to repatriate then my visa would get immediately cancelled.

The dilemma is since the rule of applying within UK due to COVID is only for candidates whose visa expires by May 2020 I am ineligible and would have to go back to my home country to apply but flights to my home country are not operating . So I’ll just wait and ask my employer to prepare the certificate of sponsorship when the flights begin as the CoS is valid for only three months!"

I have visited a few places in Europe and the two best cities have been London and Amsterdam, no two ways about it, however that's my opinion. 

London has so much to offer and I'll give you some idea of all things you can do get a feel about the place and you can then comprehend whether it would make sense for you to visit.

Museums: Yes they are right on top - British Museum, National Gallery, Victoria and Albert Museum, Natural History Museum, Museum of London and Science Museum are real gems and have the most enviable collection from all over the world. Take your pick and visit at least a couple of them and you will understand what I mean.

Night Life: Pubs and Restaurants in Soho, Covent Garden and in and around Trafalgar Square the most premium area in London won't disappoint you. You can stroll around and indulge in shopping in nearby Oxford and Regent Streets which have some of the best displays (including Harrods)

Parks and Gardens - London has a vast expanse of green space and what would be more better than exploring Hyde Park or St. James Park on a sunny morning. Visit Greenwich Park for a different flavoyr or Hampstead for a slice of serenity and calm within the city

Architecture - This is why the throng of tourists and why London is the preferred destination of visit for so many. Buckingham Palace, Westminster Abbey, St Paul's Cathedral, Tower Bridge, Parliament square are just some of the areas packed with architecture and history. Go and marvel at these beautiful crown jewels of the city yourself.

Experiences - There are plenty of experiences you can indulge in based on your taste such as London Eye, Sky Garden and Shard (for breathtaking 360 degree views), Madame Tussauds, London Dungeons , Thames River Cruise, any of your favourite football club stadium tours, Harry Potter studio tour, Sherlock Holmes tour etc. There are bound to be more than what I have mentioned but this is just so you get the gist.

Now if you feel you can immerse in the culture of London looking at the above list (which is just the surface) in 5 days, then you are most welcome."
