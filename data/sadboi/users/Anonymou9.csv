leaves,fn3oloh,t1_fn2f9pl,1586624874.0,"Hi Thankyou so much, only just spotted this now as for some reason, Reddit keeps logging me into my old account. I think that’s the hardest pill to swallow, finally saying no. I’m really worried about the sleeping aspect of quitting, do you have any advice on how I could maybe still sleep even though it’s day one of cold turkey? Thanks I’m advance ❤️"
leaves,fn35f8g,t1_fn3534p,1586613295.0,"Gosh I’m honestly really emotional because I never thought that I could find this support and encouragement anywhere, it was always “just quit, why are you doing it anyway” and I finally ask myself that question and realise I’m running from my own life. I’ve always wanted to get fit, as I really don’t like my body and this causes intimacy issues between me and my partner. Plus, I just can’t shake that “ugh this hurts this is awful” feeling the first time you exercise 😂(guilty as charged) but that’s something I am definitely going to try, I also love reading so it will be easier to get back to that again. Thankyou so much for your advice❤️"
leaves,fn3325r,t1_fn325zo,1586611555.0,"Agreed. I second to all of this. You could be screaming and crying and reliving it in front of somebody and there will always be that one person that will just be like “I think you’re lying”. Personally, even if you think that you shouldn’t SAY it to them Jesus, that will just sap all the confidence they mustered in the first place to go and tell somebody. It definitely stung coming from her as it was my best friend, somebody who I thought I could trust. (Things are about to get a little deep so if you’re uncomfortable please don’t read on) I was sexually assaulted once at 13, haven’t done anything and didn’t really know anything about shaving (weird I know sorry) and the guy I was with was a year older and he tried putting his hands where they shouldn’t be, obviously I panicked and rejected him. The next day everybody that I walked past was shouting abuse at me at school because I wasn’t shaved. He’d told everybody in year 10, and they had an absolute field day with it. 

Then again at 17. But this was worse, a lot more forceful, a lot more frightening. I won’t go into detail but I had to go to the police about what he had done. They had to take pictures and yet the investigation was closed. 

I have a partner who supports me and loves me very much and I am very grateful for him. Unfortunately you are 100% right, therapists are still people and despite the comfort of them being a stranger and being able to express your thoughts freely they still have their own views that can maybe come out sometimes depending 
on the situation. (not right at all, not condoning it)

I don’t think it’s a case of choosing sides for friends. I think it’s a case of them literally not having a clue what to say or do so they just panic and either flee and cut off contact all together or perhaps stay in contact with the person that’s giving them less hassle (as horrible as that sounds). 

Do you have anyone you can trust to talk through this with you? I’m so happy you felt able to talk to me. ☺️"
mentalillness,fn2yys7,t1_fn2vba8,1586608235.0,"I second this. I began cutting when I was 11, I am now 19 and haven’t cut since I was 17. 2 years clean. Either take a pen and draw the next line as previously stated or something I tried was saying to myself “if I can just hold on till tomorrow” “just see how you feel tomorrow if you relapse it is not your fault”. And as pathetic as this sounds, after some sleep I found that actually I didn’t want to hurt myself and I was so grateful to myself for just waiting and hanging on as there was nothing to remind me of the previous hurt and my showers were no longer painful. 

I want you to know, People are here for you. You can and will get through this. You don’t deserve the pain you cause yourself. You’re a beautiful person and there are people who love you and care about you, you’ve just lost sight of your path for a minute, that’s all. Please, please next time you have these thoughts just try and remember:
 
“I’ve just got to hold on until tomorrow.” 

Stay safe. I believe in you❤️"

leaves,fn2xvt0,t3_fz35gu,1586607237.0,"Hi there, I don’t think this is normal. I checked with my partner as I am only at the beginning of my journey to sobriety. The cravings should usually last 2 weeks (you’ll feel a bit twitchy, and uncomfortable- physical effects) at most 2 months. Not sure though, it could be different for everybody. You are always welcome to talk to or me or another user on this community (I’m always here happy to talk and everyone is super nice) but just incase I would maybe talk to a professional as a craving after six months suggests you might be struggling a little bit? Sorry if I offended you, you can do this ❤️"
leaves,fn2xei4,t1_fn2x2sc,1586606779.0,"To be honest, I’d had positive experiences with mental health workers up until a certain point. My college mentor escorted me in their car to A&E as I’d tried to commit suicide the previous night. And I don’t think you’ll quite believe what got said to me. I was sat in a room with two crisis workers and one of them just said “so how desperate are you to die? If I told you to run out into the road now would you do it?” Haven’t seen a therapist since. Don’t trust them. The only person that ever said that I was lying about my sexual assault happened to be my best friend. It’s been pretty tough 😞"

I’m very easily led when I am in a bad psychological state and I have an extremely addictive personality, even though for some reason I can quit cigarettes whenever I like, just not the smoke. I think the difference now is, I actually want to stop whereas before I was smoking my pain away, just trying to survive and not making any assertive decisions"
