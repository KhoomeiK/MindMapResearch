ARK,f8gxbdl,t1_f8elq92,1574566489.0,"In the anime Dr.Stone everyone has been turned to stone for thousands of years. Senkuu,the guy in the picture, is the first one to break from the stone and basically works to restore humanity back to its modern state. The other guy i mentioned is a really strong man and killed a lion with one punch. So Tsukasa would handle all the heavy lifting such as taming and taking down dinos and Senkuu would handle all the technical stuff like building, farming, crafting, they’d take over any server in no time."
