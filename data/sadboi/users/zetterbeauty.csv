When buying a winter jacket:

* Always buy wind-proof
* Waterproof is best, water-resistant will do
* Invest in a longer jacket that at least hits below your butt. This will be easy to find, since long puffer jackets are super in fashion for women. Not so much the case for men.
* Yes, the poofy jackets look really cool, but consider if you want to be bulky. There are plenty of equally warm jackets with thin insulation (sometimes called thinsulate).
* Several websites will have warmth ratings (LL Bean, North Face, among others)
* Consider it an investment piece. Getting a cheap jacket from Old Navy will serve you no purpose when it gets to the single digits (which will happen often. This week in particular, we're experiencing sub-zero temperatures with the wind chill).
* Make sure it's comfy/roomy enough to wear another layer underneath it. You'll be wearing a sweater to work. 

**Waterproof** gloves and boots are also non-negotiable. Make sure the boots have decent tread so you don't slip and fall.

When it comes to your car and driving:

* You'll see a lot of people turning their windshield wipers up and off of the glass. This is because the rubber can freeze to the glass. I've also noticed it helps in preventing ice from coating the blades. It's not imperative, but certainly something that's not a bad habit to have.
* If you have a rear-wheel drive car, you need to sell it, buy a second car with either front-wheel or all-wheel drive, or have a pair of winter tires to put on from approx. November through March. Rear-wheel drive won't work with the snow.
* Slow down, turn wide, break early, and give yourself plenty of room between you and the car in front of you. 
* Having a collapsible shovel is not a bad idea. Plows are good about clearing the roads, but this means snow/slush/ice piles up at the end of driveways and the like. Having a shovel to break this up if you won't be at your car for a while (i.e. at work) will save you time and stress.
* Having a bag of road salt or kitty litter is also a good habit. It will provide tread if, for whatever reason, your car tires are on ice. 
* Driving without clearing all the snow and ice off your car is illegal and you *will* get ticketed. The first offense is around $250.
* Know how to [recover from a skid](https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/watch-out-for-that-snowbank-how-to-recover-from-5-types-of-skids/).

As far as rent goes, you should be fine with the range and location you're looking at. Most of the time, snow removal is included in rent, but that will typically only be for the driveway. If there's a deck, or other areas you want snow to be removed from, this will be your responsibility. Regardless, ask if snow removal is included. I actually did look at an apartment where snow removal wasn't included. If you're looking closer to downtown Nashua, find out if it's on-street or off-street parking. If it's on-street parking, you will need to find out what Nashua's policy on winter ban parking is (in my town, cars cannot be parked on the street after 10 pm from Nov. 1 - April 1 or you get towed) and where to park in the event of a parking ban.

Find out whether or not heat (which can be separate from hot water) is included in your rent. You'll have the heat on anywhere from 4-6 months out of the year. If heat is not included, is it heat, propane, or gas? This can add an additional $100-300 (possibly more depending on how big your place is). My roommate and I have a 750 sq. ft. apartment and we have electric heat separate from our rent and our latest bill was $140.

A lot of people take Vitamin D supplements in the winter because it gets dark out early. I have definitely found a lot of benefit from this. It helps with my mood and energy level throughout the day."
