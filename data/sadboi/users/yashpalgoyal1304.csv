1. Suppose if i have a genuine number (not disposable). And I dump that number, stopped using it for all purposes.
2. So, after some time, carrier will also drop my registration with the number, and it will be vacant (saying from first hand experience) for some new user to have it  (of course, after going through all the procedures).
3. So, that number would have been new for that user, and not being able to use that number for such services as Telegram or other would be a huuuuuge bummer for such people. Who knows how many of numbers are ""second hand"" in this way.
4. And that's why the telegram system deletes the chats, as otherwise, the other new user/owner of that number would have access to all of the data of former owner of the number.

* Win + A - action centre
* Alt + Tab - switch program
* Touchpad gesture customisation

There maybe some complication still, like:

* official package may have some things not working (see [Krita](https://krita.org/en/download/krita-desktop/))
* maintained by community
* latest official package may not be available for download (i.e. u may be supposed to compile from source. I think i saw this case on OBS Studio some months ago... but it is fixed now).
* those available on repository maybe labelled as unstable officially.
