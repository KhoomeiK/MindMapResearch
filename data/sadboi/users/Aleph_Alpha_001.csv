But our tackle depth is definitely an issue, probably the biggest issue on the roster. I'm sure that Ballard would have preferred to retain Haeg, who can play some tackle, and lose Clark,  but that's not what happened. Giving Clark a one-year deal for $1.2 million was not a stamp of approval. He's a stop gap, but he does at least have experience.

Hopefully,  we continue to stay healthy at the tackle position because I agree. There's no position on the roster where the talent falls off as precipitously as between Castonzo and whomever his backup will be. 

There are,  however,  NFL teams still looking for a competent guy at left tackle to start. That means that you really have to spend a lot of capital to address the position.

Last year,  Jackson Barton, our 7th round developmental tackle, got swiped from our practice squad by the Chiefs,  so it's a difficult need to address.

Colts,fqrki2a,t3_gkk65v,1589586191.0,"INDIANAPOLIS — For most defenses, the most important positions, the spots that have to be populated with difference-makers, are edge rusher and cornerback, specifically the kind that lines up outside and locks down an opponent’s No. 1 receiver.

The Colts set their priorities differently.

Under defensive coordinator Matt Eberflus, Indianapolis draws a triangle. A tight triangle, beginning up front in the middle of the line at the 3-technique tackle, straight back to the weak-side linebacker, then out to the nickel, lined up in the slot.

The Colts believe they finally have stars in each one of those spots.

“When you have those guys in those hot spots… The 3-technique is the engine that drives the d-line, and it drives the whole defense,” Eberflus said. “That Will linebacker, and the way we have it set up, stands over the football. … Then you have the athletic player that is in space that has the quickness, that strike and playmaking ability.”

Colts general manager Chris Ballard filled the three points of the triangle in three very different ways.

He had to be talked into Kenny Moore. When the Patriots cut Moore at the end of training camp in 2017, Ballard saw a player who was too short; Colts scout Kevin Rogers pounded the table to convince his boss to bring in the diminutive Moore.

Rogers saw in Moore the intangibles, the elusive traits that make it difficult for teams to find a consistent, playmaking nickel, and it took a little time for Moore to grow into the player he’s become today.

“He’s definitely somebody who has done it, proved himself to be able to do it and is considered top tier in that position,” said veteran cornerback T.J. Carrie, who was signed in part to be Moore’s backup.


The next year, Ballard drafted Darius Leonard, drawing criticism for using a high second-round pick on a run-and-chase linebacker, a position the critics failed to realize is the bottom of the funnel in the Indianapolis defense, the place the ball always stops.

An All-Pro and a Pro Bowl later, nobody’s wondering why the Colts drafted Leonard at the top of the second round any more.

“I mean, this guy has been everything you want,” Colts coach Frank Reich said.

DeForest Buckner was the final piece to the puzzle.

A truly dominant presence at the 3-technique was always going to be the most difficult piece to find. No matter the scheme a team runs, every defense wants a dominant interior pass rusher. When a team finds a consistently devastating interior rusher, a player like Rams’ superstar Aaron Donald or Eagles star Fletcher Cox, they pay them the way they’d pay a premier edge rusher.

The problem is scarcity.

Dominant interior pass rushers are harder to find than productive edge rushers. Only a handful of players, led by Donald, are play-in, play-out difference-makers; there are far more players like Denico Autry, the free agent signing who manned the position the past two years, a player who can produce sacks in bunches but struggles to provide a consistent presence.

For that reason, when it became clear the Colts had a chance to get a player like Buckner, Eberflus didn't hesitate. 


“You ask the question when we got him in terms of, ‘Hey, if we could draft ‘X’ player or this other player at 13 or would you rather have DeForest Buckner?’ I’m going, ‘Well at least you know what you are getting with DeForest.’ You’re getting a Pro-Bowl talent, a high-level player that has dominated his position,” Eberflus said. “I had two words: ‘Yes’ and ‘Yes.’”

The Colts might value the positions a little differently.

But the principle reason those three spots are so important in the Indianapolis defense is the same reason teams spend so much draft capital and invest so much money in edge rushers and cornerbacks.

Edge rushers and cornerbacks get prioritized because they make life miserable for quarterbacks.

The same is true for the three positions the Colts prioritize.

They just do it in different ways.

Edge rushers and outside cornerbacks take away the big play. An edge rusher needs a little extra time to get home, the cornerback on the outside can take away the home-run hitter that drives an opponent’s offense.

The spots the Colts prioritize are built to wreak havoc on modern passing attacks, systems that increasingly value short, efficient throws and getting the ball out of the quarterback’s hand quickly.

The ball no longer goes down the field as often. The vast majority of throws — as many as 75% — in the NFL cover fewer than 15 yards. Indianapolis relies on its scheme to take away the big play; the Colts rely on players like Leonard and Moore to turn some of those plays into turnovers. 

A devastating interior rusher like Buckner puts pressure in the passer’s face immediately, no matter how deep he drops. Leonard, equally adept at blitzing and creating turnovers in coverage, has 12 sacks and a team-leading seven interceptions in his first two seasons in the league. Moore, the nickel back who plays with the mentality of an old-school linebacker, creates turnovers dropping underneath routes and ripping the ball away from receivers on the short routes that make up the majority of a team’s throws.

“Those three positions all connect, in some sort of way, as far as blitzing and getting to the quarterback,” Moore said. “Somebody has to get the sacks, and I plan on getting the sacks.”

Moore paused to laugh, laying down a little bit of challenge to his big-name teammates.

“It’ll be great competing with those guys and having a race to the quarterback,” Moore said. “I can’t wait.”

Neither can the Colts.

It took them three years to get all the pieces in place."

Manning was probably the best to ever do it in the hurry up, but he was absolutely reliant on it. Once teams realized that he wasn't actually calling the play until the last 10 seconds of the down, he was far less effective.

Luck's issue was just that Grigson (who you defended like a champion, as I recall) was just flat-out terrible in building any kind of a roster.

As for where they ended their careers, there's no question. Manning is going to be a first ballot Hall of Famer, while Luck retired before 30. Manning was there while Bob Sanders and Dominick Rhodes won us a Superbowl, and he was there when Von Miller won a Superbowl for the Broncos.

He also threw the pick-6 that lost the Superbowl to the Saints, and was completely dominated by the Seahawks.

Manning was great at what he did (line theatrics to try to get the defense to tip its hand), but that at-the-line offense didn't allow for much motion to create mismatches. Harrison and Wayne always lined up in the same spots. It could only do certain things,  and with time to prepare, guys like Belichick figured it out.

He kind of had to be because his defense couldn't stop anybody,  he had no running game,  and he had one legitimate wide receiver.

I don't believe that Peyton could have gone 11-5 with any of the rosters that Luck did. But he just couldn't sustain the number and severity of hits he took in those first three seasons. His body couldn't take it.

The offensive line probably upgraded in the exchange of Pinter for Haeg, but tackle depth remains a huge concern. We may end up with a developmental UDFA (Carter O'Donnell) from Alberta, Canada as LT2. We picked up journeyman tackle Chaz Green as depth, but he's never been able to stay on the field and is usually injured by the end of training camp. Pray for the health of Castonzo and Smith, because if one of the two goes down,  things could go south for the Horseshoe in a hurry. 

I think the defensive line is fine for the most part. Buckner will be a huge upgrade,  Autry will be better coming off the bench,  Turay was stellar before his injury, and Banogu should take a step this year and get a lot more snaps. Whether Lewis can hold down the RDE position on early downs will be key,  but he's been generally good in edge defense while playing DE. Green could see some snaps in relief as well.

In the secondary, we have much better depth at nickle, which was a problem last year with Carrie and Rodgers. Ya-Sin will be solid this year, and I expect Rhodes to be great at times and poor other times. Tell its underrated and may end up replacing Rhodes during the season. Willis is good to great. Hooker will be playing for a contract, so we'll see. He'll be pushed by Odum and Blackmon. I'm fairly certain that Blackmon is the future of the position, but he'll get off to a slow start recovering from an ACL injury. 

Our receiver group is still in flux. TY and Campbell need to stay healthy. Pittman is a Rookie, so it's tough to imagine huge production from him this year. I think he'll be solid,  though. Pascal is a reliable #4, but TY is still irreplaceable  in our offense.

If you really want to get your dander up,  watch the Steelers touchdown pass on 3rd down in the red zone and the bear hug that Villenueva puts on Ben Banogu. His arms completely circle Banogu for the entire play - it's the most flagrant hold possible. No call.  Touchdown Steelers. That was not the only time that Villenueva got away with that hold either.

Brady has always been a limited quarterback,  whose main asset was his decision-making *within the offense,* which relied heavily on option routes. Option routes mean that the receivers have a number of routes that they can run off a given route stem on any given play depending on a host of factors (down and distance, safety position,  blitzing players, db leverage etc.). 

The important thing is that the receiver reads the defense in exactly the same way as the quarterback. That's what allows Brady to overcome the fact that he can't move for shit and his arm strength isn't phenomenal. He throws the ball before the receiver makes his break even though the receiver has a ton of options as to which direction he's going to break. 

New England had one of the most complex passing offenses in the league,  all specifically geared to Tom Brady. Tampa Bay has to go from a Mike-Evans-go-long-and-beat-your-man offense to a precise short-passing offense dependent on quarterback-receiver synchronicity. 

It's a tall, tall order."

Jadaveon Clowney can't find a job for good reason. No matter how much value he actually delivers to a franchise,  he's going to overvalue it by $7 million per year. He'll spend every off-season holding out, cause a large amount of drama,  and ultimately cost you one or two games a year with boneheaded mistakes.

I think that Belichick was ecstatic to trade the rights to Gronkowski for a 4th. Gronk hasn't just lost a step; he's lost three. He's one hit away from being non-ambulatory with all the scar tissue in his legs and back. I think that Brady is going to struggle away from the complex option-route-dependent offense that was tailor made to fit his strengths and was implemented over the course of 15 years.

TY needs an aggressive quarterback who understands how and when he gets open and throws him catchable passes downfield. TY can come down with those passes. His routes, speed, agility, and hands are elite. I don't think that any defensive back in the NFL can cover him 1-1. 

When Andrew Luck was quarterback,  Belichick double-covered Hilton all over the field and challenged Moncrief to beat them. Of course,  Moncrief couldn't. But when Belichick designs a defensive plan to stop one guy,  that guy is the best player on the field. 

I predict that TY will go back well over 1,000 yards with Rivers at quarterback, because Rivers will lay it out there for him, and that's all TY needs.

There's nothing in this article that rang particularly true to me. 

Phillip Rivers hasn't played a snap for the Colts,  and he's the unquestioned leader? He's the quarterback, sure, but he's not even unquestioned on the Colts reddit,  which leans homer in a big way; forget about Twitter. I'd cast Phillip as the Winter Soldier: an unquestioned assasin with a lethal arm,  but also a former villain trying to prove that he's come over from the dark side.

Captain America is a protective hero anyway. His primary weapon is a *shield* for god's sake. Casting Nelson as the hulk makes sense from a size and strength perspective,  but Nelson is still a thinking player,  not a rage beast as apt to damage ally as enemy. Nelson is the first one down the field to help up his teammates. Nelson is Captain America. He's the leader of the team.

Hulk might be a better fit for DeForest Buckner.

Castonzo as Mr. Fantastic is a complete miss for me.  Mr. Fantastic is the most boring of all the superheros in the Marvel universe, more scientist than hero.  Castonzo is Iron Man, obviously, using his repulsar beams to knock villains backward. Having War Machine as Braden Smith then makes sense. He's not Iron Man, but he's pretty effective. 

If you must make someone Mr. Fantastic, I'd go with Michael Pittman, who seems to stretch out for balls that he shouldn't get, like his TD catch against Utah over two defenders.

Darius Leonard is T'Chala all the way. He's everywhere defensively, and he has his Wakanda Forever moments that are game changers. 

TY Hilton is spider man, obviously,  the small hero who clowns his adversaries with speed, agility, and the ability to stick to the ball. 

Nobody likes Ant Man as a superhero. He's comic relief. Best left of the team.

I think that one thing that you can legitimately question Ballard about is his decision to obstinately stick with Eberflus and the Tampa-2 scheme after Andrew Luck's retirement. 

I think Tampa-2 really hinges on playing with a lead because of its softness in the middle and intermediate edges. It often trades yardage for time,  which is great when you're playing with a lead,  but terrible when you're playing from behind. Everybody already knows how to move the ball effectively with the pass against cover-2.

Without prime Andrew Luck,  I would really like to see a more aggressive, attacking defensive scheme.

I'm not worried about Rivers at all, as long as he stays upright. I think Pittman will be solid, if unspectacular, next season. Few receivers light up the NFL in their first 8-10 games. There's a learning curve and a big jump in competition. NFL defensive backs play against NFL receivers every week. 

Taylor is a guy who can make an immediate contribution. He's our OROY candidate this season. He's got a great line,  and he has the jets to break a couple of 40- yard touchdown runs early. Nelson can get the edge for him, and watch him go. I also think that he'll be better in the passing game than expected. Wisconsin didn't use him much like that,  but he's smart and has good awareness. He'll make good decisions about outletting versus chipping and he'll get his head around in time to catch a pass. 

TY is going to love Rivers. He's going to be  big-play threat again, and TY is a playmaker. He needs a quarterback who isn't afraid to throw it his way even when it appears that he's covered. That's Rivers.

I don't know about Campbell. He'll take a step,  or he won't. We'll see."
Colts,fpnmeec,t1_fpmh4vg,1588767363.0,"The real problem is that Hooker isn't a great fit for cover-2. He was drafted to support a single- high system. If he were a great talent,  he would have adjusted to cover-2 and still been great,  like Mathis adjusted to becoming an outside linebacker in the 3-4.

But switching to cover-2 only emphasized the negatives in Hooker's play. He's not a great in run support. He's not a great tackler. His awareness hasn't progressed at the rate you need it to. He's had injury issues. He's not picking off that many passes. He's not defending that many passes. 

Up to the second half of last season,  I think that teams just weren't challenging him,  because they could throw to the other side of the field and run to his side. But Hopkins exposed him last year to an extent, running long on his half of the field for a touchdown, and Hooker jumping an out route that wasn't there. Hooker didn't get into the TV frame by the end zone because he got beaten so badly. 

Those are the plays that cover-2 is designed to prevent. You have to watch the quarterback as a cover-2 safety,  and you can't bite on an out fake while the ball is in the quarterback's hand. Watson didn't even pump fake,  so there's really no excuse. Just terrible awareness. 

It was a rookie mistake by a third-year safety to give up a lead in a game for the division, and Ballard was still pissed about it at the end of the season. 

If Malik is going to wear the horseshoe in 2021, he'd better ensure that those plays don't happen,  and he'd better pick off 3 balls in the first 8 games. Otherwise,  he'll lose his starting job by November. 

It's time for this sub to stop worshipping Malik Hooker for two highlights per season. He almost played himself out of a job last year, and he hurt his value and the team tremendously.

Ballard had to draft for the 3-4 cover-3 defense that the Colts played in 2018. He had to give Chuck Pagano a fair chance to prove himself and his system. No one knew for sure whether the problem was Grigson or Pagano. It turns out the answer was *both.*

Basham was a 3-4 OLB. Basham was just in a bad position after Pagano proved himself to be Pagano and Ballard made the switch to the 4-3. Basham wasn't a bad pick.  He's a solid player in the NFL.

Hooker is in the same boat. He's a single high safety. He needs to be playing in cover-3 or cover-1. He's been generally fine in cover-2, but not great. He would be better in a single high system, but Hooker is not an otherworldly talent that you change your defense for. He's just not a great fit.

I'm also suspicious of all this ""Tampa-2 sucks"" talk. Any system,  offensively or defensively,  can be great as long as you have great players that match the scheme. 

Tony Dungey's Tampa-2 in Tampa Bayv was impossible to run against. The Colts Tampa-2 under the same coach couldn't stop the run to save their lives. Why? Because the Tampa Bay defense featured Warren Sapp and Derrick Brooks.

In 2006, the Colts were dead last against the run in the regular season,  but first in the playoffs. Why? Because of Bob Sanders.

Last season as OLB (2) on the Jets,  Basham had 33 tackles,  2 sacks,  and an interception. He'll probably be the starter this year. Basham was sacrificed because 4-3 defenses don't have an OLB and he was in the process of transitioning to DE, but you can't say that being a quality backup in year 3 with a shot as a starter in year 4 is underperforming. 

Mack was a productive starter in his 2nd year in the NFL. That's outperform for a 4th round pick. He eclipsed 1,000 yards last year in 14 games. That's massively outperforming for a 4th round pick. The Colts haven't had a 1,000 yard rusher in 15 years,  and you act like they fall off every turnip truck that passes by Lucas Oil stadium.

Bob Sanders totally controlled the game when he was on the field. He controlled the run game. He controlled the passing game. I've never seen *anything* like that from Hooker."
Colts,fpie6ig,t1_fphlgez,1588639066.0,"2017 was Ballard's worst draft,  and it was still well above average. 

Hooker has generally been perform at expectation to slight underperform. 

Wilson has been severe underperform. 

Bashem was perform at expectation. 

Banner was severe underperform. 

Mack has been perform well above expectation. 

Stewart has been perform at expectation.

Hairston was perform at expectation. 

Walker has been perform above expectation."
Colts,fpicb88,t1_fphjx7q,1588637981.0,"I believe that Ballard feels Blackmon is the guy. He's got good speed,  good coverage skills,  he is a great run defender,  and he is a beast of a tackler. I mean,  this kid lays the wood.

I think Blackmon and Willis are pretty much bookends at safety, and that's really what you want in Cover-2 (not run to one side of the field and pass the the other). 

Taking those short routes over the middle isn't so tempting when your receivers are getting the shit knocked out of them every time they catch the ball."
Colts,fpia4ed,t1_fphi2x5,1588636712.0,"Eberflus was recruited by McDaniels, who left him (and all the assistants he recruited and who quit their jobs for him) dangling in the wind. 

The Colts honored agreements to McSnek's assistants,  and the coaches who have proven themselves were allowed to stay. Degugliomo only stayed for a year and Mike Phair for two, but Ballard, Reich, and the Colts organization have been more than fair."
Colts,fpi0ti9,t1_fphhtg2,1588631442.0,"We were all excited when he was drafted, but he HASN'T lived up to either the hype or his potential. He hasn't improved as a tackler, and his big plays in coverage have been few and far between. He has never taken an interception to the house. He has never forced a fumble. He has knocked interceptions out of other players' hands."
Colts,fphof55,t1_fphe0kf,1588624867.0,"They were trying to work a sign and trade deal,  where the Colts take the 5th year option and then trade him. Ballard would have wanted at least a 2nd for him,  because we'll likely get a third comp pick.

Hooker isn't gone yet,  but he's going to have to really play lights out this season. He could still be extended,  but Ballard doesn't feel like he's worth $6 million ro the team next season. He's definitely playing for his next contract now,  either here or elsewhere."
Colts,fpeqsqq,t1_fpdx9rk,1588552966.0,"He's been ... average. He's not great in run support, and he doesn't force fumbles; so he needs to be snagging 4 or 5 interceptions a year,  not 7 in three years. And he gave up some big plays last season, which is unforgivable in cover-2. 

He hasn't played like the 15th best player in the draft. He's played like the 40th or 50th best player in the draft. He's made 76 solo tackles in three seasons. Khari Willis made 58 solo tackles *last year.*

I'm pretty sure that the only way Ballard picks up his 5th year option is in a sign and trade deal. Otherwise,  he'll start next season,  at least for a while,  and unless he's *spectacular,* he'll be allowed to walk in free agency."
