He waited until literally the last possible moment and didn't buy a ring (I mean ever, we have been married for 6 months and he never bought me an engagement ring - we can definitely afford one). I admit, I am still hung up on it. It makes me feel really bad that he just never did it. But I love him, and we figured it out. I have some empathy for where he was at the time, and it was a cruddy situation for both of us (he was moving for work, I wasn't prepared to go unless we got married because the move was a big hit to my career. Although I was prepared to do distance.) 

Don't wait for her to tell you. My husband never bought me a ring because he is waiting for me to tell him it's time.

Parenting,fo5p2g2,t3_g5rnct,1587531405.0,"This happened to me when I was a toddler. My family breeds golden retrievers and we had an old dog named Summer. When I was born I became Summer's ugly bald puppy. She wouldn't let me out of her sight and slept on the sheepskin rug beside my crib every. Single. Night. And she went in when I went to sleep, not when my parents did. If they came in to check on me, there was Summer making sure everything was ok.

One day when I was just learning to walk I fell on her and she snapped. She got scared and when she saw it was me she stopped on a dime and started licking my face to calm me down. My mom was so angry she couldn't even look at Summer until the vet told her what a special dog she was because she stopped.

Old dogs startle. And kids startle them. I'm so glad things are good for you all. I think this happens more than people think it does. I do echo the concerns about teaching your son how to respect a dog's limits. They definitely have them."

And that is the most terrifying thing. Then they are providing sub par legal services. And that is DANGEROUS. Desperate people will hire these ""lawyers"" to fight for their homes and their children. Furthermore if there is no liscensing requirement how do we police ourselves? How do we ensure those new ""attorneys"" have enough insurance, or any insurance at all. WHEN these attorneys who had no right practicing without a license do ruin someone's life, it's not like the bar can suspend their liscense. That's the problem. This is a mess, you are right. But it's irresponsible to let anyone with a JD practice. Many can't and shouldn't, and there has to be some way to make sure that those who are allowed to practice are at least minimally competent to do so.

LawSchool,fnsxj54,t3_g3eo43,1587230688.0,"I posted this already, but wanted to make the general thoughts know to all:

I get it, but you aren't being punished. I had the world's worst start to my legal career. I had to study and pass 2 bars in as many years, which equates to about the same amount of time being unable to work as you all will likely face. One bar was CA, and because I do trial work I was out of work for 6 months through the process after practicing for a year. But I played by the rules and made it work. I empathize with you. But the fact is that  you may have to do something else for a while. The fact will remain you are NOT an attorney until you pass the bar. Until you pass the bar you have a JD. Practicing is a privilege that you haven't earned yet. And most people who sit for the bar in CA don't earn. Does this suck for you? Absolutely. But it also sucks for everyone else. NO ONE KNOWS WHEN THIS WILL END. If they cancel the bar it is not about them punishing you. It is about keeping everyone safe and preventing millions of deaths. Also news flash - EVERYONE IS SACRIFICING THINGS NOW. High school kids can't go to prom, or graduation and, they certainly won't be able to get jobs easily. Many may no longer be able to afford college. Those coming out of undergrad face the worst economy since the great depression. This isn't about you. And the lesser of all evils is not to let a bunch of unbarred ""attorneys"" loose on the world with no supervision to cause more pain. I'm sorry life isn't fair, but its not. At least if you are functioning as paralegals you are still learning and building the skills you will need. You sound like you think that the minute they hand you a diploma you should be ready to take a case to trial. You are NOT. You will get your chance, and I'm sorry you have to wait another 6-8 months, but for heaven's sake stop whining. The first year in practice you can't (and shouldn't) be doing much in the way of actual practice unless you are in a government criminal job. The first year anyway is largely research and drafting while you learn what the fuck you are doing. So you aren't losing as much as you think. It's not conventional, but your career is long. IF you pass the bar.

P.S. Even if they give you some sort of break on the bar, I know of 0 attorneys who would hire someone to work for them as an attorney (i.e. to practice) without a bar exam. None."

For the first 18 months I couldn't ask him for help without it turning into a fight about how he needed to have his own autonomy to manage his time. Then he would manage his time into procrastinating long enough that I had to do it. I tried everything. Finally I picked one thing, the trash, that was his job alone and would not do it for him. I left it, and let it drop, and WE ENDED UP WITH FUCKING MAGGOTS ALL OVER OUR HOUSE. Meanwhile I was managing my second bar exam after moving for his job, the Lions share of our wedding, looking for a job myself and ALL the fucking housework. I burned out hard and ended up in the psych ward.

After that he seemed to realize things needed to change. So he's a LOT better now. But i didn't change him, he made the choice after seeing what his unwillingness to act like a team did to me. Your husband seems like he's in the same place. He doesn't want to give up ANY of his ability to do whatever he wants. This is selfish and it's a problem. I think you need to be honest with yourself about whether this is the life you want.

Also possible: my husband has ADD, diagnosed after our marriage. I think part of his behavior was defensive because he was so easily distracted and embarrassed about that.

Usually it's related to stress or disappointment as others have suggested. My husband and I got engaged right before a huge move. Basically I told him if he wanted me to go he needed to propose before he expected me to give notice to quit my job. He had like 5 months and a trip to France between when we had that discussion and when I wanted to leave my job, and he waited until the absolute last possible weekend. It was not a surprise at all. I knew the moment he would propose, I had the whole plan figured out, AND he didn't bother to buy a real ring or size a place holder (actually he also failed completely to buy me an engagement ring at all. He just never did it). For a while I felt really bad about how he screwed it up
 To boot we had to start wedding planning before he proposed because he waited so much longer than we agreed. And we ended up having to do the bulk of wedding planning while moving 3000 miles, he was starting a new job and I was sitting for another bar exam. It was horrible. HORRIBLE.

I asked for one and my dad gave me a book on dog training and let me pick my first dog, Sage. I LOVED Sage. I took her on walks every day, housebroken her, crate trained her, taught her to retrieve. She was my buddy. My parents always had my back with her. They fed her with their dog, they took care of her when I was at camp, or boarding school (3 month international program) and when I couldn't have her at college. But when I asked for her, they let me take her with no questions. When she passed away and I got my current dog, Sages great niece, they had my back, took care of her when I was a first year associate and helped me pay for her while I got on my feet. That being said, we are a obviously a dog family, and for both dogs I did the Lions share of the work. It taught me responsibility and how to put someone else before myself and I will 100% do that for my child.

It seems like that is not the case here. I think your son at 9 maybe didn't realize what went into the dog, and you all took over the work. But I see where this misunderstanding came from.

Since then I've taken the CA bar exam, moved across the country, planned a wedding and gotten married, my dad got cancer, my husband's dad had open heart surger (4 days after the wedding) , his uncle entered hospice and I started a new job at a new firm and learned a new area of law in a new state.

In terms of vacationing, we got two long weekends in tropical destinations and took a week long cruise with my family. The cruise, for many reasons, was not particularly rejuvenating (traveling with elderly parents is tough). So basically we had 5 days in a year and 5 months. At this point I don't even know if I want one."

Marriage,f7loxjh,t3_dwqr2a,1573845193.0,"I had a total mental break this year. My husband went to business school in a different state and it was hard on us. The first year I bore more I'd the burden even though I was in my last year of law school and taking the bar. I moved and it didn't get much better. Then we had to move to the opposite coast for his job and I had to leave a job I loved, and take the CA bar exam and find another job. On top of it all we were planning a wedding, my dad was diagnosed with cancer and his family was also struggling. Finally about a month after I started my new job I totally broke. I ended up in the psych ward because I was so bitterly depressed. It is day by day now. I used to be totally out of control of my emotions, and now that's better, which is good, but I still struggle sometimes despite medication and therapy.

A few things that work for us are:
- I try to tell  him when I'm in a bad mood. It helps I think.
- I try to make sure he is supported.
- 

It's not perfect but it's getting better. You will too."

I do A LOT of things myself that would usually be handled by a paralegal. Also - if you get lucky at a small firm you are VERY lucky. But there are no HR departments. If you have a toxic firm environment there is no recourse for you other than to leave, so personality is important. Also, you make a lot less money at first.

The flip side is that you will get a TON of experience. Im two years out and taking my own cases to trial by myself. And you probably won't burn out like your big firm counterparts, so you have more options later in your career and more useful experience."

Before that I was an ADA and I really LOVED that. Now I'm doing more real estate and transactional work and I hate it. More than that I hate that I had worked so hard and built such an amazing working relationship, twice, and I just don't feel like I can do it again. Im not making the same progress at my current job. I don't think taking a leave would do anything, but I am talking to my old boss about getting my job back. Otherwise, I feel like I should quit. I loved this and I wanted it, but with all the moving I think maybe it's just too hard. I think I could have loved this, but it feels like I really burned out on it fast. My husband knows how much I loved it, so he's encouraging me to stick it out, but we have to make some changes somewhere.

Honestly just not being yelled at for not being totally selfless is nice. I feel like I have been asking for advice and most people just tell me how terrible I am. But what do you expect online I guess. Thanks for telling me I'm not the only one."

And I've been telling him that, and then we had to sacrifice our honeymoon period (for something admittedly that we didn't have control over) and I just feel like its ruined everything based on how terrible I'm feeling. I have thought a lot recently about quitting law. I just feel like I can't keep doing my job and doing all this shit for everyone else around me.

I think we may move back, and honestly I want to. Is there anything you have done specifically that has helped you deal with this kind of stress? At this point I actually regret the wedding (not the marriage) because it has led to such extreme burnout with everything else."

Money is not an object for them, so I'm not worried. I just think if he's unwilling to say no we have to go back. I feel a little like we left our east coast life behind but are still trying to live it from afar, if that makes any sense."

Even if you don't and up working in that field, at least you have the tech skills.

But really, if she doesn't want to stop working, you shouldn't fucking make her.

Our fix is threesomes. If I really want sex with a woman we go find one. And we sleep with her together. Can I think too it's important to note that I have told him, more than once, that I don't really think people are designed to be monogamous. So while we are that way now, I want it to be an open conversation. I never want him to be afraid to tell me he wants something different in bed, or that he's attracted to someone else. I think those experiences signal that you need to make a change. That change could be a night in a hotel alone, or a new sex toy, or something more radical like considering a semi open relationship for a time. But we will get there when we get there. 

Your gf doesn't get that you can't have it both ways. You should consider moving on. You all are still young. It feels to me that she just isn't ready to commit. I cannot imagine looking at my partner and telling him that I want to sleep with other people but don't want him to, especially now.

Also as an aside, sex really isn't fender specific. Bisexual people don't have woman sex satisfaction tanks and man sex satisfaction tanks. That's BS and she is trying to tell you she just isn't satisfied period."
