lonely,fqlzivi,t3_gjbsry,1589468892.0,"Iâ€™m 43 and lonely too and yes social media makes it worse. I feel like I donâ€™t fit in anywhere because I have no niche to my life. Iâ€™m not sporty or in a career, I donâ€™t have social hobbies, no friends etc. 

I sometimes feel sad that I donâ€™t get to go out for coffee and have a conversation with a friend or get invited to weddings, parties or bbqs etc. 

I am currently saving up for a German Shepard pup. I need a companion. 

Loneliness is awful."

I agree with the sleeve length, must be elbow length and yeah the crew neck ones can be yucky and you feel like you're choking. I much prefer v neck myself and I think the v neck style is more flattering on big boobs and big bellies."
