if you convert everything to USD now, you would be partaking in damaging the pound. In countries like Turkey, people do the opposite, everyone took out their foreign currency so they can exchange it to the local one in order to keep their lira strong. But I get it, the same ""national unity"" doesn't exist in Lebanon, and you have to fend for yourself first.

You need to take very small steps. You know you have to do this, but you don't have to do everything once. Once you're there, don't force yourself to automatically blend in and become picture-perfect happy the next day. Get accustomed to your kitchen. to your living room, the public spaces and try not meet so many people at once.

On an individual level, it's hard to avoid compromise and follow the system 100%. It's always tailored to turn the odds against you, so you risk starvation at every step of the way and rewards you nothing for your loyalty, unless you follow a certain political party and this party grants you even more immunity to break even more rules, so it's one big cycle...

But we shouldn't pretend it's purely a Lebanese thing. The difference is in Lebanon we think loudly about it and still do nothing to remedy the situation.
