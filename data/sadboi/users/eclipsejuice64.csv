When bananas are over-ripe, they become completely brown, which may look unappealing and unappetizing to customers and thus, no purchase will be made. Not only so, but once any fruit becomes over-ripe, it attracts fruit flies and ants.

unpopularopinion,fj8qary,t3_fc5h08,1583119502.0,"I believe Billie Eilish can sing and her music is catchy and original. I think many people do not like her because the mass media made it seems as if she is glorifying mental health problems as a trend since she sings about it a lot in her songs.

Matter of fact, Billie Eilish has a soft tone, rather than a vocal powerhouse (Ex: Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey), to her voice and that is her style of singing that works in the favor of her and her target audience, which I think many people do not like and considers it as “whispering.”

Also, I think many people do not like how overexposed she is in the media in comparison to other artists that have been in the music industry for a longer period of time than she has, such as Lana del Rey and Ariana Grande. 

In my opinion, what is unappreciated and underrated about Billie Eilish is that she writes her own songs, knows her style of singing and fashion sense, knows the types of songs and genres that match her vocal range, and knows the proper techniques of how to sing with the vocal range that she has. Not that many people factor these facts into her artistry and I find it rather disappointing since she is where she is now because of them."

You have to do this because 1331 is an enrollment requirement of 1332, and so the UH system assumes that you will have 1331 credit once the Summer session ends, and so then, it lets you enroll in 1332 for Fall.

To qualify for FAFSA financial aid, you need to take at least 6 credit hours worth of courses in the Summer. For some scholarships and loans that are not FAFSA affiliated, you only need to take at least 3 credit hours in the summer.

Since you’re pre-nursing, I recommend that you finish your nursing school enrollment requirements at community colleges (CCs) because not only are the classes less expensive at CCs, but you also have the luxury of avoiding the science classes at the UH NSM college.

The next infamous is Physics.

As a life advice, go into nursing because you have a genuine passion for taking care of patients, and have a high tolerance for difficult to work with colleagues.

I’ve come across MDs who belittle their RNs, BSNs, and LNPs, and those nurses ended up wishing that they switch professions while they still can. 

Don’t even think about on campus housing at UH because you will not get what you paid for. You have to buy mandatory meal plans that are $2K per semester, and you are never guaranteed proper WiFi connections at the dorms. It’s better to commute than living on campus for money’s sake.
