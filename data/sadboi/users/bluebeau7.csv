I see in the details section of the photo that it is a jpg. Is there anyway to export it to tiff at this point, or would any exporting further degrade the quality?"

Galaxy_S20,fj4yuh2,t3_fbjne7,1583020177.0,Check out upsie. Have used them in the past even with a claim and they were awesome. It's like $100 upfront and $75 if you ever need to start a claim. No loss or theft though.
Galaxy_S20,fj4rcuk,t3_fbjhm3,1583015052.0,"There is another thread (search motor on this sub) that shows that the S20 uses a round motor that looks exactly the same as the ones in the S10, Note 9, ect. The S20+ and ultra has the square linear motors.

I was upset since I ordered the S20, so I drove out to BB this morning to test just the vibration between the + and base S20. I turned up the haptic vibration all the way on both and tested ring vibrations, typing, and messed around with the wheel on setting an alarm. I found-

Vibration on the S20 feels much better than on my Note 9. It feels more like a thud, much less mushy. The S20+ felt like it may have had a significantly stronger vibration than the S20, but they felt VERY close. It may have been placebo, but the + did feel slightly better to me, but it's still a HUGE upgrade from my Note 9. 

The vibration motor being different was honestly almost enough for me to cancel my preorder and look at the plus, but after trying both my concerns have been eased."
