lexapro,fjiu508,t1_fjik835,1583375797.0,"Im for those too, i was thinking of doing LSD as a way to help me with my anxieties in the near future, but that would also require me  to not take my lexapro.

I used to be a lot more safe with substances in the past, the only exception i made was to take mdma other than the ones you mentioned. Then something just clicked, chasing high and all that.

Anyways, i have been clean for 9 months from drugs and 6 months from alcohol at this point, but my mind is weak sometimes, and i keep telling myself that i ""deserve"" to have som fun too.

I havent slept in almost two days, the ssri withdrawals make me unable to sleep, but i took my full dosage of both lexapro and my anti psychotic just now, so i think i will be able to restore and think more clearly when i wake up. 

Sorry for writing out my whole life story haha."

Drugs,ff3r9hm,t1_ff3f5bt,1579547135.0,"I feel numb too, but i think its a mix of depression that has for long gone untreated, my mood stabilizing meds and my brain being wacko. I am trying to stay off all drugs now so i hope that this is somewhat reversible at least"
Drugs,ff3qyym,t1_ff3fa4m,1579546955.0,"I forgot to add this in my initial post, i have had two brain scans after that new years and it definitely shows signs of what could be a mini stroke or swelling of a small area in my brain. I have not noticed any normal signs of brain damage so they chose not to proceed on it any further.

I have considered that this might be the cause but i did not think that all the feel good receptors were in one spot of the brain."

SkincareAddiction,ex4mpdz,t3_cr13jr,1566007332.0,"So, since puberty started I have both grown in height and also gained some weight. This has left me with massive amounts of stretch marks, mostly on my back and most other places of my body to but not to the same extent. I have accepted that I can't remove themand that I will juat have to live with it, however, I have also in later years got pretty bad acne on my back anf shoulders, and sometimes cyst like acne in thr stretch marks themselves. This acne is making something that looks meh look horrible instead and I would like to know what I can do about this. My self esteem is and has been low from this for the last 8 or so years, hell, I haven't taken my shirt off in front of anyone in those years and I am quite frankly just sick of it. I will call a dermatologist on monday to see if I can book a meeting with them.

Any input here? I'd really appreciate it. I will add that my older brother was put on accutane during his teens. He had waaaaay worse acne than me but didn't evet get any stretch marks"
