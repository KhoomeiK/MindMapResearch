He was actually at the store from originally a breeder, he was ""rejected"" as a show rabbit because his markings aren't quite right. My boss had two flemish giants at home, and she really wanted to ""rescue"" this little guy but wasn't sure her rabbits would like him. I had had rabbits before and was always saying I missed having them...so fast forward to the next day, and she just keeps bringing him up over and over again, and I was trying to resist/be a responsible adult and not impulsively get a pet but...I was doing a bad job. She brought in all her extra supplies and cage from when her rabbits were young (and smaller!) for me. And then in the middle of my shift she just hands me $50 and was like ""go and get him!"" - I guess she couldn't stop thinking about him!

I've been trying in vain to find a good one with a top (my bun has HOPS) to use in my living room, so he doesn't have to go in a cage all the time when I'm not home. I've tried several options and yours looks like exactly what I need!"
