Furthermore, depression isn't really a good risk factor for suicide--there are more specific psychological constructs that are more relevant to understand *some* of suicidal behaviour.

An influential concept in this field is psychache which was already mentioned here. You also have the interpersonal theory of suicide (Joiner), where suicide is more relevant for people who have (1) an experience of being a burden to others, (2) don't feel accepted by others and (3) who have acquired the skills to complete suicide (for example: war veterans, men, people with previous attempts etc).

In other words, socialism is just a general motto for ‘We shouldn’t be egotist, we should think about …’ Everybody can be a socialist. That’s meaningless. I am for communism. Of course not for the 20th century, but whatever…

Furthermore, he doesn't really establish a positive assertion or sketch of communism, but he does often call for a reinvention of communism, as it continuously should be reinvented through how we interpret our contemporary material world.

Så kan de, bevisst eller ubevisst, beskytte seg fra dette blikket fra andre. Strategier man kan ty til da kan kanskje være å avvike fra skjønnhetsidealene ved å overspise, kle seg kjønnsløst eller kanskje til og med ønske å skifte kjønn.

Regrettably most people get help way too late (more than a year on avg if I recall) after the psychotic break, and this is why the prognosis isn't as good as it could be.

That said, symptoms similar to DP/DR—alterations in self-experience that can lead to anhedonia, lack of interest and various thought-related phenomena that disturbs concentration, among a lot of other things—are well documented aspects of the prodromal state of schizophrenia. You describe how you are physically depersonalized and your emotional self has disappeared, which doesn't at all contradict the possibility of prodromal schizophrenia. People with prodromal symptoms, or the ""ultra high risk"" group, afaik from the statistics, has a 25fold—50fold chance of developing schizophrenia compared to the general population.

After all, using qualitative sources for concept formation is a way to ensure validity for social scientific concepts.

worldpolitics,fnwzh9k,t1_fnwrnpb,1587328506.0,"> But this is all semantics, it’s not really important.

Yes, but the implication of speaking that way is still different. That reduced consumption just has to be bad *per se*, which is just a product of economic abstraction. Additionally, sure there is a virus response, but the economy has been ripe for crisis the last 12 years (e.g. interest rate non-recovery, quantitative easing addiction, unleashing of the financial sector) which has lead to the system eventually undermining itself through systemic problems within its agriculture. 

Furthermore, as you detail the particularities of an economic crisis, you simply reveal the fundamental difference in your own mentality and that of OP which makes you project something entirely different onto the same information. Let me try to detail it, when we produce and consume what everyone needs, there is really, materially, not a problem. And what you outline in detailed form is not natural law but some model applied to this particular system that we all actively reproduce, it's not self-sustaining. However, a system that collapses because everyone gets what they need, is nothing other than a glaring contradiction--it reveals itself as a complete failure. 

Out of this contradiction we can only conclude that it clearly is not a system meant to support regular people, and as such, to think of the economy means mostly we're supposed to fight for banks and corporations. This includes the same entities that have thrown people into dire straits since 2008. Your depoliticization of the situation through economic fetishism (""this is just how it works, economics is just like laws of nature"") is exactly a political/ideological strategy. The politics of a crisis consists of the urgent question of who's going to be dealt the hardest blow. The lamentation of the economy is in this sense just a masking of the refrain: ""the weak suffer what they must""."

Staying inside *is* reducing consumption. It's inseperable to it. It's like saying ""we're not trying to help this person breathe, we're shoving a respirator down his lungs and coincidentally he happens to breathe as well"". 

You also seem to repeat frequently that we are ""forcing"" people to stay inside. Any way we organize society, people are ""forced"" to be part of it. A shorter work day is similarily ""forced"". If we were to ignore the coronavirus and let go to work again that is also ""forced"".

You're using blanket statements as if GDP represents any kind of unified activity. To reduce GDP is the manifestation of this particular reduction. There are other reductions we arguably should do, for example oil, gas, travel, advertising, length of the work week, etc., not for the sake of reducing GDP but because these activities are considered bad.

I've never claimed that reduction in GDP is a goal in itself either short term nor long term, because as I repeat again and again, GDP is only an abstract metric. During this time we should *definitely* reduce specific forms of consumption and production, while maintaining production of what's essential for all to get by, regardless of employment status. Why a drop in non-essential (that literally means *not essential*) production and consumption means some won't gain access to essentials that are still there, and why any drop in gdp hurts poor people more than rich people, is a matter of politics, not economics."

I'm not saying anyone's trying to reduce it as much as possible. You seem to continuously misrepresent me. Due to social distancing, we're reducing non-essential consumption. Actively.

When facing information that seem to threaten the integrity of the self, we experience strong unconscious anxiety. We then use more or less unconscious defense mechanisms to manage this anxiety. A strong ego manages this anxiety very well, it can rationalize, intellectualize, use humour etc. This leads to flexibility, a stable sense of self, and little anxiety. A weaker ego gets overwhelmed, and have to resort to less flexible defense mechanisms such as projection, repression, splitting, projective identification, concretization, somatization. The result is that depression, dissociation, paranoia, even psychosis become necessary to maintain a certain psychic integrity. The result is also an unstable sense of self, no sense of ""clear coordinates"" as to who one is or even where one is, strong almost engulfing anxiety. These are characteristics of what in psychoanalytic theory often term borderline or psychotic conditions or personality organization."

>We’re not intentionally reducing our gdp, we just have to decrease it to fight the virus.

Which means that the decrease is intentional. The economy consists of the set of all our movements, you don't reduce an abstract concept like consumption through some kind of lever, you do it by pausing non-essential services, restricting the activities of cafes, supermarkets, events, etc. This is a deliberate consumptive reduction.

You seem to equate idealistic economic models with the whole of reality. That somehow we can't get by unless we are able to endlessly increase our consumption. It's not true. We have essential services running and we can consume them as we normally would, until operations are back to normal. This is no problem. As for free time as a desirable outcome: Working people have gained enormous ground through reducing the work week *and* the work day, taking out enormous productivity gains for their own health and well being to the detriment of profit. It would be arrogant to claim that improving our health and well-being isn't a good thing, and that people don't want that. This is part of our common history, and this is why it's not in our interests to lament the dying economy. If a small and necessary dent in our economy is enough to make us homeless and hungry, while there is just as much homes and food as always, then what use is the economy really?"

No it's not. We're free to carry on as usual. Social distancing are active measures. Social distancing can't be done without reduction in consumption.

No, I'm not. And it's not that ""some people"" don't want to work. Nobody wants to. Otherwise we wouldn't invent technologies that makes our work easier.

>During the Great Depression we were producing less, consuming less, and working less. Does that seem like a fun, relaxing lifestyle?

This is a false equivalence. We are already producing less, consuming less and working less, and obviously we're not living like we did in the great depression. Besides, if we can't do necessary reductions without our lives being thrown into complete disorder, then clearly we have a system that doesn't work.

As for the long term idea: Many people want to live in a somewhat slower world with more free time, less pollution, and where the only motivation for growth is to increase automation in order to ease and reduce even further the work necessary to live.
