dating_advice,fqziczw,t3_gl8asi,1589768012.0,"Busy yourself doing something else that is fun and/or makes you feel good about yourself. It will get better over time, but it takes WAAAAAY longer if you are laying in bed going over idealized scenarios of what might have been.  Exercise helps greatly. Good luck."

COVID19_support,fqwwv7q,t3_gl87wv,1589720031.0,"I've been out and about more than you, but usually go out in the early morning when there are way less people around. Still wearing the mask, gloves, and wiping down groceries. I'm not chomping at the bit to get out in a crowd anytime soon, and can't imagine going to a restaurant, concert, bar, etc. for a while. I hope it all goes away, but why would MORE people out in public make that happen?"
COVID19_support,fqpgr74,t3_gjvdx7,1589545992.0,"Some days I think about it, but for me the risk is too high. I just eat frozen and canned food and wipe the packaging down with disinfectant once I get them home.  I feel bad for the restaurants I see advertising online and I know they are suffering, but it seems like a real gamble/leap of faith."
DataHoarder,fqmlbyq,t3_gjdxyo,1589479339.0,Cheers. Part of me wishes I had not stopped writing in journals years ago. Maybe I should start again today.
nostalgia,fqk3ghe,t3_gj2j0g,1589419524.0,Mug has cream soda in single bottles at every liquor store I have ever visited. Besides that Shasta always has it in cans; check the dollar store.

COVID19_support,fqjechj,t3_gj4w34,1589408749.0,The isolation doesn't bother me either. I'm also lucky enough to be able to work from home. But the contagion threat to myself and my family as well as the possible economic repercussions are no good.
nostalgia,fpt92u4,t1_fps7mgy,1588887010.0,Looking into it now. Thanks again.
nostalgia,fps4my3,t1_fpqlir1,1588867388.0,Thanks for this info. Do you know if the police quest bundle has the SWAT games?
depression,fpoclws,t3_gea6mo,1588782219.0,"True, but I know the feeling. I have experienced it with people I thought I would always be friends with. I would send them messages or call them and they just stopped replying. If I reach out to them, it's all good, but over time the message/ response ratio went from 50/50 to 90/10. The big thing over time has been learning to appreciate the day, my present life, and myself. Even if no one else cares about me, I care about me. Good luck."

PublicFreakout,fphfo3k,t3_gcvihn,1588620450.0,"I have seen signs on the front of convenience stores in different spots in LA that speak to this practice. It's frustrating. That guy did probably a grand of damage and probably stole a beer and some cheetos. But if the owner ( justifiably) hits him over the head with a bat, he's suing."
PublicFreakout,fphcta0,t3_gderh8,1588618988.0,Reminds me of some idiotic neighbors I used to have. I really don't miss them.
COVID19_support,fpeii8u,t3_gc1gej,1588548203.0,"I feel you. I had a 5 minute convo with my neighbor yesterday. We were far enough apart, but I had just taken my bandana off when getting out of the car. I can take comfort in the fact that before the mask thing and social distancing were mandatory I was going into CROWDED supermarkets with no gloves or mask and shopping and never got sick. Am I cavalier enough to do either of those today? No. Good luck to all of you."
