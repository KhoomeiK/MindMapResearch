AskReddit,fkjfk1m,t1_fki5kjk,1584244440.0,I've had the ambien scare. An ex gf asked if I wanted to take half to help me sleep. Apparently I woke up same thing semi lucid and was grasping at the ceiling and mumbling nonsense. I vaguely remember her calling her social worker asking if she should call 911. I might've dreamt the whole thing since it was all fuzzy.

I've been in both successful and unsuccessful ones, and sometimes I just wish I didn't get myself into those situations. Better to have loved than not at all I guess. I say good luck to you when you do get into one, cherish the good parts and learn to let go of the bad ones."

depression,ewql7u5,t3_cpidz8,1565669340.0,"depression for me is always a constant fight to get up and put one foot in front of the other. Its a journey without a destination, always looking up to an unfamiliar ceiling every time I lay down and rest my weary body and mind. Sometimes I think there's nothing else left for me to feel, that I've felt every happiness out there and that it was never meant to last. Therefore, I was never meant to least. There's something comforting in accepting what it could mean in the end. I heard a good one the other day, ""I keep telling myself I'm not lost, I'm just on my way. On a journey to somewhere I feel like I'll belong""."
funny,ewhxb9h,t3_codbnw,1565427356.0,"I can understand the sentiment. The phrase ""if you love what you do, you don't have to work a day in your life"" comes only if you're that lucky to find what you like to do. Having a decent income comes first before being happy in your job unfortunately. Such is the struggle."

lonely,evbdckt,t1_evbcd92,1564373383.0,sometimes you just do what you can and it works or it doesn't. Life has a funny way of keeping your expectations down and getting your ready for failure and disappointment. Do things that make you happy without the need for anyone else. Got any time consuming hobbies?
lonely,evbc69m,t1_evbb7h0,1564372275.0,"sometimes ppl don't understand or care to understand the imprint they leave on others. I don't know about your situation but to me it sounds like a cop out just to not have to deal with having you around. Not saying that you deserve it but I just assume ppl think of themselves first before others and most ppl don't think what the consequences of their actions are. I know its hard but you learn to move on to the next thing that makes you happy. The more you learn, the more you don't make the same mistakes and you'll have the foresight to be ready for anything."

depression,evb9gnb,t3_cj1d4o,1564369843.0,"I envy happy ppl. I envy ppl in happy relationships and I find myself looking at pictures of acquaintances that are in happy healthy relationships, (romantic or otherwise). I look at their happy faces and wonder why I couldn't have something like that. At least something that lasts. The way they look at each other with happy smiles and you can just tell, they mean something to each other. Not to say I've never had it before but craving that human intimacy is just a fleeting feeling for me. I'd like to think of myself as a decent human being. I do my best to throw out as much positivity out there hoping some will come back but it all seems moot. So I just do my thing day after day but in the back of my mind, what is it all for? is there some kind of silver lining at the end of this? I can't tell for sure but I have to keep soldiering on. Have to keep keepin on."

Makes the rifle look futuristic and such. In terms of where to put that pesky thumb, I also got the juggernaut tactical finger rest to compensate for lack of placement and ergonomics, and it actually isn't half bad. I'd rather not worry if I'm following the rules or not I suppose. Less questions asked and more pew pew"
