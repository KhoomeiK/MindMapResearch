BPD,ezaycs1,t3_d0nkfp,1567809732.0,"That’s like my life in a nutshell right now. I just started my job too and I already got a warning from HR for not getting along with a few people even though I don’t think I did anything wrong. People say I look down all the time and I try so hard to remind myself to fake it and not think about suicide every time someone notices.

I like to fantasize about their reactions if I really did do something like that, a lot. It’s fucked up. 

But it’s Friday and I told myself I’d just learn to fake it next week, like really fake it. I usually let myself break down in the bathroom and go back there after. Just remember they don’t matter and pretend it’s like a game, because those people at work are temporary and you’re basically there for the money only. 

I just think of the money I’m earning and how I can go home and be alone.

People are so fucking nosy and annoying at work."

My goal weight is 105 and I’m 116. I feel like if I’m 105 all of my issues will go away and people will respect me.

I believe I have it, I have all the symptoms and the past for it. I think we’re just good at manipulating our therapists into thinking we’re normal because they don’t see us for more than an hour and they do most of the talking. I don’t know."

BPD,eyzafia,t1_eyyqy02,1567613263.0,"It honestly didn’t help for me and has made the situation worse. The person harassing me is older and is abusing their authority and not listening to the rules my boss had outlined since the situation happened, which is irritating to me. I feel like nothing will be done and I’ll end up being fired for it even though I did nothing wrong.

I really appreciate your post and it’s true and that’s what my boss said when I cried; that we’re all human. 

She’s a nice person, but I also feel like she favours the other person over me because of their job status and age maturity.

Oh well, what’s done is done and all I can do is silently try and control my BPD even though it’s tough not to lash out and go manic today.

Thank you again for your input."

And I remembered I had some hidden bud I’ll have to throw away. 

I know most of my depression isn’t about weed but it’ll help me build a clearer mind and get to be more in control of who I am and find out who I am, I don’t know.

Still feel numb and everything but I just want to get through the week.

Thank you for caring."
