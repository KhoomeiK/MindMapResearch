depression,etsmcph,t1_etsluir,1563149445.0,"Yeah, I get the numbness, I’m sorry to hear you feel that way too. But maybe this numbness is not exclusive to us, the depressed ones. Maybe others feel the same, but they fake it better or genuinely don’t care? You know, those people who make no efforts to not be a piece of shit? Maybe we feel like we don’t care, but what If this means we actually care too much? I mean, why are we “wasting” our time here talking about how we are a burden to others? I think it’s a good thing to reflect about."
depression,etslt1d,t3_cda4dh,1563149017.0,"I used to act like this. It sucks and I’m sorry. I hope you manage to feel better. What helped me is that I realized that suicide will never be an option for me, I accepted that I need to live so eventually (not out of the blue, I needed therapy and medication) I stopped fantasizing about suicide."
depression,etslf3s,t1_etskx94,1563148717.0,"Awesome! Most people dealing with depression forget / don’t care about their body. I think what you said is pretty positive. Do you care about your family and friends too? I mean, do you effectively feel happy for their accomplishments? Do you care for their well-being?"
depression,etsksdc,t1_etsk8p9,1563148229.0,Is there something you love and care about yourself?
depression,etskfn4,t3_cd9yjr,1563147960.0,"Take care of yourself. Read a good book. Rewatch a nice tv show. Listen to your favorite music and find new  music. Cook a good meal, or if you’re feeling like it, just grab a nice fast food if it makes you feel better. Go for a walk. Ultimately, I honestly believe it’s about taking care of yourself, loving yourself is the only way to get rid of this burden feeling. It’s very hard to accomplish this. Good luck, I hope you have a better day tomorrow."
depression,etsjrnc,t1_etsj7dt,1563147449.0,"Why did you stop? And don’t we have to take them every day for a long time to start feeling better? I had a good experience with lexapro. I’ve been taking them for a year now. Not everything is great in my life and I too get anxious attacks sometimes, but in my case is triggered by an specific issue. I don’t mean to make this about me and I’m sure everyone get different reactions from medication, but I’d like to point out that not keeping a routine with therapy and meds might make things worse than actually having no help at all."
depression,etsjc14,t1_etsipd0,1563147125.0,"You made this post to complain about your current therapist, and now you said you’ll never change no matter how many therapists you find. I don’t mean to sound rude,  but your message makes me think that you actually have hope and you do believe your potential. Please find a different doctor."
depression,etsj210,t1_etsijfo,1563146915.0,"Thank you for taking the time to write this, it means a lot. Are you currently on therapy and / or taking medication?"
depression,etsifu0,t3_cd9p5b,1563146455.0,"Try a different therapist? IMO you’re not supposed to feel this way about your treatment. Some people are treating a broken leg, others are dealing with cancer and at this moment in your life you are facing mental health issues. It’s okay."

depression,etshcz3,t3_cd9hwh,1563145635.0,"I’m similar to you. Meds and therapy helped me become functional, now I have friends and socialize too, work is great and I’m healthy, money is not an issue (that I worked for, no one gave me) yet I don’t quite know how happiness feels. I stay for the others. I feel like I’ve given up on myself."
depression,etsgolm,t3_cd6d58,1563145129.0,"I used to feel like this before taking medication and going to therapy.  Nowadays I do have good/ bad days, but they don’t happen without a reason like they used to."

depression,etrxssh,t1_etrxdns,1563131570.0,"Thank you for clarification. I’ll ask my doctor. I have this strong feeling of disappointing my therapist and psychiatrist, so I tend to hide that I drink and self medicate. Thank you. It sucks to be a mess. I hope you get to adjust your second medication without huge issues and side effects."
relationship_advice,etrvr6x,t1_etrub4t,1563130161.0,"I’m extremely open to criticism, I’m also not the type of person who blames others, which doesn’t feel so good as it might sound. I mean, great, I know I’m the only one to blame, but the problem is I blame myself too much and inflict self pain, which my girlfriend sees as manipulation. Anyway, thank you. I wish you the very best as well."

relationship_advice,etro6eo,t1_etrn3br,1563125448.0,"Thank you for the message, it’s very accurate.

We are both in therapy, I take antidepressants. 

I always make sure to ask her if she needs a break, and she always say no. I feel like I need a break, but I’m afraid this is me just giving up and sinking in depression, so it’s not the case of taking a break to get better.

The issue: I’m insecure. I know I’m pretty, smart with a dream job, but I don’t FEEL It. I feel like a piece of shit. I fear that she will leave me for one specific friend, so whenever the friend is a subject, I get really fucked up. I cry, I breathe heavily, I feel anxious, it’s like I get a panic attack. It’s really frustrating for both of us. We’ve been dealing with this issue for over 4 years already. It’s tiring."

relationship_advice,etrma2w,t1_etrlm97,1563124237.0,"Thank you. I forgot to add, but I absolutely hate and avoid conflicts. I’m not comfortable with the screaming, but I get that it’s her trying to express her feelings."
relationship_advice,etrm2w8,t1_etrliau,1563124107.0,"Thank you. I know what I’m supposed to do, but it’s like I feel blocked to be my true self around her, I mean a smooth fun whatever person while I have all these complaints that I’m supposed to fix. I don’t want her to get the idea that I ignored her complaints, you know? Something Like “omg how come you’re inviting me for dinner after everything I said?” I mean, how do I show that I’m working on things without sounding like I’m happy and confident etc and don’t care about the complaints?"
