Anxiety,f858jxd,t3_dgedyv,1574269928.0,"Honestly, talk to your professor about this, some are very understanding. My list spring semester I skipped probably 80% of this one lecture because the mornings are always really bad for me. 


I finally messaged her and explained my situation, whenever I was able to do anything, I would go to her office hours to get help with the stuff I missed (this honestly only happened around 3 times). At the end of the semester, she boosted up my failing grade to a passing one. She made sure to email me and check up on how I was doing every once in a while and when I came to the lectures (probably 2 times) she came up to me and asked me if everything was fine.


The thing was, beforehand, I never thought to talk to a professor about this because I was always scared that they would think I am lying but when I did I found out that professors really do want to help you. Now, I tend to reach out more to professors when things are happening or when my mental health is especially low just so that they know that I'm trying but this is the best I can do at the moment."
migraine,f7eyw1j,t1_f79x051,1573668784.0,I guess its moreso all the doctors that have brushed me off in the past 10 or so years since I have been trying to figure out what is wrong with me that makes me anxious about trying again. But I will attempt once again to get to the bottom of this

It took a while but I'm finally going to a doctor this Tuesday so fingers crossed she'll know what to do to figure this out. The closer it's getting to my appointment the harder it is to wait"

Upon reading it, I retired my moisturizer and will now use it for my feet. I went out and brought a simple gentle cleanser and a tub of CeraVe moisturizer. I guess I will go from here and work on my diet for a week or two and see what happens."
