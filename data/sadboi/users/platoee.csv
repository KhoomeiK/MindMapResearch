antinatalism,fejamzs,t1_feicqv3,1579164384.0,I agree with reducing suffering and I also agree that adopting is probably morally superior than having a kid. I don’t agree with the ending humanity part because I think we can apply profound meaning to our lives and live our lives happily for generations to come. Anti Natalism is based on the pre supposition that life has no meaning although I think it has no objective meaning it definitely has subjective meaning. If I am getting something significantly wrong please correct me.
