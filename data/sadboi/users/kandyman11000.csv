AvPD,fqcl3wd,t1_fqcg3vo,1589261110.0,"Thank you for your kind words. Logically, I can understand what you're saying, but the constant intrusive thoughts saying the exact opposite sucks :/"
AvPD,fqcdp6x,t3_gfdblp,1589255704.0,Absolutely feel the same. I feel like I just can't be close with anyone in my family anymore. Idk if it's just a natural reflex now but I just get filled with anxiety when I'm around them. I also feel guilty about it. I feel like my whole family just puts up with me and I also feel that shame I SHOULD be closer.
AvPD,fqcbv2e,t1_fq9nzy2,1589254487.0,I gotta say your list is a bit daunting lol. Find someone despite my absurdly irrational brain. I'm already stuck at step one. I'm glad your gf found you but it's just tough forming relationships when you can't form any sort of intimacy. Your words are still something to think about though.
AvPD,fqcbcim,t1_fq7j3l7,1589254153.0,"""My AVPD manifests itself as an inability to ask for help from even my  closest friends, to sustain close relationships, and trouble with  intimacy and self esteem/shame issues.  As such, I feel like a shell of a  real person most days."" 

This so much. It's the shittiest feeling knowing that they care and would probably help me with these issues if I could just connect on an intimate level with ANYONE. Feeling like more of a shell than anything these days as well. Wish you the best."
malementalhealth,fodsw1x,t3_g6h372,1587689506.0," ""it's hard to talk to people and act okay and not get tired."" 

I feel this so much. I know it's not healthy but lately I've decided to internalize and keep my emotions to me only. It is physically draining having to keep my fake face on. I hate being alone too but it's the only time I can truly breathe and relax. I'm sorry for your loss and hope one day you will feel okay again."

depression,fo9ruqq,t3_g6f54u,1587628950.0,I'm very happy that you're feeling good again. May I ask what you were prescribed. Been struggling with anxiety and depression for a long time but have always been afraid to ask for help or medication. Maybe this could be a helpful first step. And cheers! I hope the feeling never goes away for you.
depression,fo9rmlu,t3_g6ie5g,1587628728.0,I'm so sorry. Watching the decline of a loved one can sometimes be as bad or worse than the eventual death. Just love him as much as you can while you can. I feel for you and I hope you can learn to be okay again.
depression,fo9regu,t3_g6fnj4,1587628512.0,"First of all, Happy Birthday! Secondly, I feel you. My birthday was 3 days ago and it sent me into a depressive episode. Just hang in there. Usually I start feeling better the farther it is away from my birthday and I'm okayish until the holidays start coming around. I'm sorry. It's horrible timing for a birthday right now with all this isolation."
AvPD,fo9p9vf,t3_g5lpwo,1587626472.0,"This soooo much. I want so bad to not just have ""surface relationships"". They aren't fulfilling and rarely last, leading to feeling even more alone."
AvPD,fo9of4d,t3_g6dyq4,1587625680.0,I don't have much advice. But I completely empathize with this. I've always had a bad habit of attaching myself to a particular friend. Quite recently I've done this to a very good friend of mine. And I also don't want to cross any sort of line of inappropriateness. Obviously I'm not her only friend or person she's close to. And when she's unavailable I feel truly alone. I know it's not healthy but I struggle to maintain a bunch of different friend groups and I feel I can be the most honest and close with her. I think the best thing is just learn how to be okay without your friend. Easier said then done because I still have not been able to accomplish this.
depression,fka3qqu,t3_fh917o,1583991444.0,Congrats and you're right. Asking for help can be one of the hardest parts for some people.
depression,fka30kf,t1_fk8jr2w,1583990725.0,I feel this is something I do a lot. Try not to compare your depression to others. Everyone deserves to be able to not be okay no matter the reason.
depression,fka2xdy,t1_fk6q35c,1583990640.0,Feel this in my soul

AvPD,f6kobpg,t3_drrk50,1572916670.0,I feel you. Especially to those I actually care about. I want to tell them so much what they mean to me or even just compliment them but I end up either being awkwardly quiet or just coming across as rude af.
