Don‚Äôt take the following too personal, it‚Äôs just a strict guideline to follow. 

Do not write too much about your personal life ‚Äî almost everyone applying had some personal life experience that made them want to major in psychology, so they‚Äôre used to hearing that. The life stories that pushed you to psychology is not a competition for who had a worse. Also, do not write about how you are ‚Äúexcited‚Äù or ‚Äúelated‚Äù or ‚Äúpleased‚Äù or to apply to the program or anything like that. They are not there to accommodate how you feel. Also, do not use grand adjectives about your previous educational experiences (‚ÄúI have taken an extensive amount of rigorous courses‚Äù) because that is for them to judge. As tempting as it is to make it all sound much better, it‚Äôs a big turn off for them. In the end, keep it simple but be unique! Hope this helps a little bit.
