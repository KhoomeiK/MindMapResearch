depression,fqfyt0d,t3_gintu4,1589334411.0,I resonate with this so much! I actually just got out of a 7 year relationship last year. I still haven’t found a way to forgive myself for all the time I wasted and the regrets I have. It’ll come eventually though! Congrats on finally coming to terms with it. I’m sure it’s a huge relief off your shoulders.
MeetPeople,fqfk7a3,t3_gimtxz,1589326378.0,Old school Cartoon Network was the shit! Courage The Cowardly Dog is my all time favorite. And Regular Show!
videogames,fptpi9j,t3_gf8icl,1588895677.0,"My first recommendation would be the Borderlands series! So much fun. Other good ones would be A Way Out, Resident Evil 5, Left 4 Dead, Human Fall Flat, Gears Of War, Terraria."

MeetPeople,fohxzvk,t1_fohxnt0,1587774833.0,I agree with this as well. Or another option because I myself don’t have Snapchat or Instagram and I’m sure some others don’t either.
design_critiques,fo5stik,t3_g5vh0n,1587534575.0,Hi there! First of all great job. I like it! Especially for someone who only has limited design experience. I would suggest fixing your text to line up a bit better. I noticed this when I saw that the gap in between words on the top and the bottom were off placed with one another. I would also suggest maybe playing around with a different position or rotation of the zzz’s? They’re cute but it It looks a little off to me. I would play around with their placement.

depression,fo3q2mc,t3_g5hpuq,1587491089.0,"I’m currently experiencing this and I’m only 22. My best friend who I’ve worked with in the past remembers tons of things back when we worked together and I can’t remember most of these things. Or if I do it just sounds vaguely familiar but I can’t fully remember. I noticed this happened in the last year or two. It makes me very depressed because I had so many memories that I wish I could remember and want to feel what I did when I could remember them but I can’t. I have currently tried journaling. I write a daily summary in 365 journal, then I have a separate journal to write any feelings or memories that I don’t want to forget. Maybe this would work for you or help out a bit."
offmychest,fo2fhjo,t3_g58m87,1587460407.0,You deserve to have friends who will put in an equal amount of effort. Don’t waste all your effort on people who won’t reciprocate back. It’s definitely hard to find friends who will last but sometimes they come into our life unexpectedly. Just keep doing you. I’m here if you’d ever like to chat.
offmychest,fo2f1q6,t3_g5ayxt,1587459923.0,"I know exactly how it feels to not have many friends, I only have one myself. I’ve tried and been the only one putting in the effort in past friendships, so of course you ask yourself what’s the point if others don’t reciprocate back? It’s a valid feeling right now because with everything going on it makes us realize this and wish we had others there for us like we would be for them. I’m sorry that they treat you that way. You have a right to feel the way you do and you definitely deserve better. I’m here if you’d like to talk!"
depression,fo0s67a,t3_g4yvxm,1587418770.0,I’m here to talk if you like. I feel the same. Nice username btw!

depression,fny1z86,t3_g4jsrt,1587351464.0,"I know exactly how you feel. As an extrovert, Socializing and going out enables me to get out of my head and distracts me mentally. It’s been difficult not having friends, supportive family, and being forced to change your whole lifestyle and get rid of coping mechanisms. I hope you find something that interests or helps you out soon. I know it’s easier said than done. Feel free to reach out if you need to talk. You’re not alone here."

depressed,fnxokv3,t3_g49a6f,1587343026.0,Hang in there! There’s quite a few of us who are going through the exact same thing as you. Going from recovering to struggling all in a matter of a few months. I can’t even imagine what it would be like if this would continue on for a few months but I know we have to keep on pushing. I’m in my early 20’s as well and feel like my whole life is on pause or more of it is already wasted. But I try and think of the things I’ll catch up on after it’s over and try to make the most of things in the aftermath. Feel free to reach out if you want to talk!
lonely,fnxo3j3,t3_g46vzo,1587342729.0,Totally agree. I was already feeling like I didn’t have much to look forward to before this happened and now its gotten worse. I only have one best friend but he has a gf and unfortunately that means I come second and so we have boundaries in the friendship. It definitely sucks to see others who have so many other friends and then us who don’t have any or only a few.
GothStyle,fnwj9gk,t3_g49yjp,1587319433.0,You look gorgeous girl! 🔥
depression,fnwj66z,t1_fnuv0nx,1587319384.0,I’ve never looked at it that way. That’s a good take on it. I’ll take keep that in mind. Thank you.
offmychest,fnwj14k,t3_g3yf23,1587319306.0,You’re welcome! Will be looking forward to hearing your progress and how it goes <3
offmychest,fnuwrrk,t3_g3yf23,1587273191.0,I relate with you so much on this. Especially struggling with motivation. I have depression and I can suddenly lose interest in things I once enjoyed or even for my career. I try new things but it doesn’t last long. I’m also the same way about relationships. I’ve only ever been in one real long unhealthy relationship and now that I’m out of it I happened to fall in love with someone who is already in a relationship. I know I’ll never find what I feel or the connection so strongly like what I have for them. I would suggest trying out therapy as well. I haven’t tried myself but I’m trying because I just want to be happy and not feel numb about life. It may be very beneficial. Don’t listen to those thoughts or anyone who tells you that you don’t have a reason to be depressed. We all have our own reasons. It’s ok to reach out for help. Feel free to reach out and vent more if you need to!

depression,fnuuo1m,t3_g41jb4,1587271547.0,I’m the same age and going through the exact same thing. I feel like I’ve wasted a lot of time already and have so many regrets and can’t keep up. Other people are going to tell us that “we’re young and have so much life left to live!” But that doesn’t change the way we feel. I like you have spent a lot of my days gaming because of a lack of motivation to do anything else and it’s one of the few things that’s entertaining or distracts me. It’s a truly conflicting situation wanting both to make up for lost time and then not bothering.
nintendo,fnus6ar,t3_g3ptch,1587269683.0,My application for graduation was accepted and I’m graduating with my associates next month 🙂
depression,fnuo8tj,t3_g3ljni,1587266875.0,I always feel conflicted with this. Sometimes I feel like I need to someone to talk to and so I reach out but then regret it if they don’t bother to keep up with me. I have a habit of always being the first to reach out and then always feeling like I’m the one who puts all the effort in. There’s times where I want to reach out but tell myself not to and to just wait and see if the other person will bother. I understand that people get busy but there has to be some people who will put that effort back for you right? I think some of us have different views and expectations on this and that’s what makes it feel worse.
depression,fnun874,t3_g3ulx1,1587266157.0,"I’m sorry to hear about your mental health declining. I’m currently going through the same thing as well. I’m 22, and even I feel like I’ve wasted so much time but everyone that’s older will tell us that we’re still young and have lots of time left and shouldn’t regret much. But it doesn’t change the way we feel. I was struggling myself at the beginning of this year and it’s gotten a lot worse. The things I do notice that help is staying productive or keeping busy but how can we do that if we lack the motivation or feel restless? We have to really push ourselves or need a little help from someone else. Try switching up your routine and trying something new if the existing coping mechanisms don’t work. I know it’s easier said than done. Hang in there. Feel free to reach out if you need to talk or for help."
depression,fnulvmt,t3_g3rrzg,1587265221.0,"Sorry to hear you’ve been struggling. I’m currently going through the same thing. What I’ve found that works the best is keeping yourself busy. Which I know is hard when you lack motivation. For me, I play a lot of video games and work on art. I would suggest different things ranging from simple stuff like cleaning/re organizing, Cooking & baking, exercise, watching movies, listening to music, or try  to learn some new stuff online and maybe discover some new hobbies. Anything that distracts your mind will prevent you from focusing on these moods and thoughts. Hope any of these help. Here to talk if you need anything! Stay strong."
