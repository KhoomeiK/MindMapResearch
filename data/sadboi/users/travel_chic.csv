A portfolio in school is meant to show them how you think: they want to see what you have done creatively and understand what purpose it served and why. All the skills you will learn in classes will enhance basic ideas like alignment and marketing tactics, but your portfolio is really there to show them that you’re not a literature major who decided to ‘change things up’ by suddenly applying to art school.

Art schools are VERY competitive. When accepting students, they want to find people who are committed and willing to work hard. Some (like mine) will actually put undergrads through a vetting process freshman and sophomore year, only to select a handful to continue the degree towards graduation."
ASU,fk48hej,t1_fk2qg2z,1583855463.0,"I think that’s part of the issue, though. The state is cutting funding, but ASU keeps spending and building like it’s not a problem. The new senior living center for elderly is built on what used to be a sold-out student parking lot. When I was an undergrad (02-06) the LL building was already condemned on some floors and students would literally miss class being stuck in a broken down elevator sometimes; yet, they didn’t tear down or start to renovate until just last year. On top of that, I have to PAY TO GRADUATE. Even if I didn’t intend to walk, there is a processing fee to register AND to submit the completed registry; the grad cap / gown / hood will cost me $150+ NEW because there’s no rental or recycle program. It’s a little ridiculous. 

It’s not just students either: staff and faculty are also charged for campus parking, the same as students. We have a handicapped professor who had to APPEAL for handicapped parking space near the building a few times and (again with the elevator maintenance issue for a COMPLETELY different building!) sometimes has to reschedule classes last minute because she can’t access any of the floors with stairs.

Let’s also not forget the ASU Giveback program where they are literally asking students and alumni to constantly give MORE money to the school. I constantly quote John Mulaney to my partner when I see the marketing for it.
