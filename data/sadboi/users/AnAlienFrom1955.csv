OnePlus7Pro,fr5fcpb,t3_gmmlzt,1589907641.0,Is it possible to go to beta with TWRP installed and rooted?
Visible,fr240fa,t1_fr225gg,1589830770.0,"I ended up getting everything working on havoc with all of the apns. Every other rom for some reason mms wouldn't work. I finally just went back to stock, however ended up having to use msm tool because TWRP wouldn't restore my backup for some reason. I think I'm missing something in regards to dm-verity and or installing to ramdisk, that was causing issues. Idk, I'm back on stock but rooted at least."
Visible,fqyhpy7,t1_fqyhkex,1589748767.0,"I figured it out , I added MMS to the VSBLINTERNET apn even though it doesn't say to, and MMS started working. However the phone won't let you set dun as an apn type for some reason. Not sure what dun is for."
Visible,fqyddbw,t1_fqy3ptz,1589746767.0,Just got havoc os setup. Only thing not working is mms (and wifi calling of course.  No idea why.
Visible,fqxxapa,t1_fqxwz49,1589739263.0,I just wasn't sure if on certain ROMs it considers it a GM1917 still and if that's why it works on visible without even having to mess with apns. They officially support the phone despite not even selling it.
oneplus,fqx7r3j,t1_fnbb8ko,1589727653.0,"Does she spend a good time on it though like the rest of the population? I'll never understand this. It honestly feels like people just think they're cooler for saying this. My girl is def not on her phone as much as me, but there are a good number of days where she comes close, but yet she acts that same way. She could ""care less about cell phones and tech"". Like why wouldn't you want to know more about something you spend so much time on. I'll never understand that. It's like being a truck driver for 30 years and never once learning a thing about trucks lol. Idk if that analogy totally works, but you know what i mean."
oneplus,fqx6j7s,t1_fn9bj1m,1589726903.0,We need more people like you in stores. I was just typing that it's ridiculous that a customer would come into a store and think they know more than you about the subject to even say that.......and then I realized that is actually my experience lol. Idk how many stores I've gone into where I had to explain tech stuff to the people working there and they try to tell me basic info like it wasn't common knowledge and they were actually teaching me something lol. Happens a lot at best buy and TMobile. I shouldn't have to teach the tech guys about phones lol.
oneplus,fqx64q3,t1_fn9cvcm,1589726657.0,"Yes for sure. This is my general experience. It's hilarious when one of em owns a $1000 phone too and joins that conversation, but thinks they're excluded because they make payments LOL. It's shocking how many people in the US apparently enter into payment agreements just because and could care less that they're still paying for a $1000 product lol."
oneplus,fqx5x78,t1_fn9gg65,1589726525.0,I'd understand if they just didn't care about tech but most of these people have a phone in their hand all day long lol.
oneplus,fqx5ukx,t1_fn9gug3,1589726479.0,"Meh, a lot of people still won't. There's a certain segment of the population that just thinks it's a thing to be tech ignorant (while ironically still relying on it in their daily lives). And not just old people."
oneplus,fqx5f7z,t1_fna9brm,1589726207.0,"How? I've owned every phone under the sun for a short period of time and the OnePlus 7t and and 7 pro are the smoothest I've ever used, literally.  The only thing that makes me not want it is it being a 100% Chinese company. Other than that the phone it's self, software, top notch."
oneplus,fqx5az5,t1_fncqsa0,1589726131.0,"My friends will do this to me because I'm a nerd in general/tech nerd/phone nut and they couldn't give a shit less, they just get the most bare minimum Android phones for $60 lol, so when they see me with a different one they'll start asking questions which will lead to strangers joining in if they're over hearing."
oneplus,fqx546h,t1_fnonst3,1589726007.0,"I know a bunch of people that think even $500 is expensive for a phone, and will only buy budget ones (not even midrange). It's also surprising how many people will say the same thing because they are making payments. It's like they enter into a payment agreement without realizing how much the total price is, and they make themselves exempt and treat it as if they bought a budget one lol."
oneplus,fqx4wl2,t3_fzyemz,1589725870.0,I can have a similar conversation except the person will still think $500 is outrageous and will go on a rant about how they'd never pay that for a phone 😄
oneplus,fqx1q92,t1_fqx1j8c,1589723726.0,Yeah I realized that. I think it's for the 8 and 8 pro.
OnePlus7Pro,fqv7iu1,t1_fqv769k,1589671450.0,It shows you in the battery settings.
OnePlus7Pro,fqv5qp2,t1_fqv5cx7,1589670411.0,Screen on time. Yes I always have dark theme on too.
OnePlus7Pro,fqv59gc,t1_fqv1i02,1589670136.0,"Damn even with only 60hz and 1080 looks like I'm gonna get about 5.5 hours SOT. Nothing unusual going on with apps, every app set to optimized and I don't play games. Not terrible I guess but figured it'd be a little better."
oneplus,fqv52nd,t3_gkwjec,1589670027.0,Don't see it in settings or oxegyn updater for 7 pro.
OnePlus7Pro,fquxu8s,t1_fqusv41,1589666184.0,Lemme know if you get drain. I have nothing to compare to since I bought the phone and went straight to updating it.
OnePlus7Pro,fquckmw,t1_fqubg12,1589656351.0,Oh you mean battery drain from the update its self? I just got the phone and am a new to the OP7P but immediately updated. When I got to the January security patch and previous OOS version it kept telling me I was up to date. I guess that's probably why then. I used oxegyn updater to update and I have noticed that battery wasn't what people claim. I had 90hz on and 1440 and I got about 4-4.5 hours SOT. It should be more then? I am getting more today but I changed to 60hz and 1080 plus have naptime installed.
OnePlus7Pro,fquawcw,t3_gkyyeq,1589655412.0,Why are you hesitant to use oxegyn updater?
juggalo,fqsx2wi,t1_fqsj35f,1589622035.0,"To be fair it honestly might be, the word juggalo is lol"
WWEGames,fqruqf7,t3_gkiham,1589592311.0,Why does online universe only have 6 percent. Even the way it is now would be something totally different if it was just online.......and I'm not even an online type of gamer.
oneplus,fqrman2,t3_gkjox8,1589587238.0,855 is last year's flagship processor lol so even if you did game much it'd be great.
OnePlus7Pro,fqrfjuo,t1_fq6m9e6,1589583354.0,Does naptime make things reload in ram?
Android,fqqbfyj,t1_fqqb9zo,1589562635.0,I just received it a little while ago and have been playing with it/setting it up. Doesn't bother me at all. Never bothered me on any of my Samsung phones either. I don't really have a preference either way. I don't get accidental touches or anything. The case it comes with probably helps a little too
Android,fqo2y8p,t3_gjuuu9,1589506493.0,"Well......shit. I just payed $549 for the OP 7 Pro when it randomly came in stock. If this is the case maybe I should just send it back, wait, profit, and save."
tacobell,fqo2j59,t3_gjzsjx,1589506251.0,What?
OnePlus7Pro,fqma0wp,t1_fpqbfgj,1589474017.0,Did you use a tripod? I've tried on so many phones including a pixel and it never comes out like this.
OnePlus7Pro,fqm9o7k,t3_gfku1f,1589473849.0,"If it was caused by squeezing, it was probably also because of the case pressure. Some cases crack some phones after a while just by being on."
GooglePixel,fqlso0e,t1_fqljrvw,1589465322.0,Who says that? Everybody has been praising this unicorn phone like it's the second coming.

Visible,fqlcwwn,t1_fqjkxod,1589454312.0,Nice. I should've waited for your reply. I seen the OnePlus 7 Pro suddenly come in stock and jumped on it. But the A51 is $150 less with the free buds lol. How does it perform? All I see is people talking about lag.
PickAnAndroidForMe,fqj7t96,t1_fqj4nil,1589406218.0,Ah. Sorry 😔. The 7t is in stock at least. I keep getting emails about it.
PickAnAndroidForMe,fqiikx8,t1_fqicm24,1589396478.0,What is a lie? Check the 8gb model. It's $549. The 7t is $499. That is $50 more. What is wrong with people today?
PickAnAndroidForMe,fqiicza,t1_fqi6a5w,1589396393.0,I wasn't trying to not help people. I got the link my self from one of the previous posts about the 7t being available. Someone also linked to the 7 Pro being available. Below me someone has linked to it.
PickAnAndroidForMe,fqihmm9,t1_fqicso3,1589396112.0,Right there on the link above you. For whatever reason the 8GB model is less than the 6. Choose the 8 and it'll say $549.
PickAnAndroidForMe,fqhkzsg,t3_giuphx,1589379105.0,"Got me a 7 Pro. Double the storage, better design, bigger battery , 1440p , less green tint. Just seemed like the better buy to me for only $50 more. I hope I'm not wrong."
Moto_Z,fqfno2f,t3_gg6h4z,1589328199.0,I thought the bumper only worker with the one battery mod. It works with all of the mods? Can you point me to it?
Android,fqfbnkv,t1_fqexj8b,1589322048.0,"Because I'm a phone nut and saw deals for phones on other carriers I wanted to take advantage of. But then weeks later I was like why did I do that, Visible was too good of a deal, and ended up going back."
Android,fqdzy2g,t1_fqdygg3,1589299473.0,Those are some good points. They just didn't immediately come to mind to me.
Android,fqdxn9u,t3_gidkg5,1589298372.0,Why lol
Android,fqdwt9b,t1_fqdnxhk,1589297963.0,"I love it. Between referrals and party pay I've managed to get my bill as low as $5. When there are signal issues, which for me is not as common as other users act like, toggling airplane mode fixes it right away. I've never had a problem with CS, they're almost always helpful. I've ported in an out a few times and it always went smooth. Only thing I don't really like is the limited amount of phones that are usable, though I have found some that aren't supposed to be that are. I get coverage almost everywhere. I traveled halfway across the country once and it was no worse than any other service."
Visible,fqdwler,t1_fqdt3y4,1589297854.0,"Oh, cool. Come back and let me know! Lol"
Visible,fqdryvv,t1_fq221px,1589295553.0,"So did you end up getting it? Very interested to hear about it in general, as well as how it works with Visible."
Android,fqdm2z6,t1_fqcec5x,1589292462.0,"On paper you're right, but it keeps up with every single device I mentioned, even the Pixel 4 somehow. And the camera with gcam is pretty decent. Although having said that, I paid $336 for it at Visible which is less than it's still being sold elsewhere, but it probably should be $249 at this point. At that price it'd be much more considerable."
Android,fqdlsgu,t1_fqcyx72,1589292299.0,"The aforementioned lack of updates, outdated.  Other than that, not much lol. For what it is I'm it's segment, it is under rated."

Android,fqc4nw1,t1_fqc2qyh,1589250042.0,The mods? Randomly bought off eBay so probably. The phone it's self? No lol
Android,fqc4k3c,t1_fqc2u1b,1589249981.0,"Seems under rated to me. I also have the new G power and for like $75 more it has an AMOLED screen, better camera , twice the storage, faster CPU (noticable), and the mods.  I don't ever see people mention it in regards to budget phones and idk why. It's solid. In the past 6 months I've also owned a Pixel 4 XL, S10, S9, Pixel 3a and I don't think it's that much worse than any of them."
PickAnAndroidForMe,fqbr2c1,t3_ghyb0v,1589242274.0,"The 4a definitely is not going to be better than the 4 XL. The S10+ will have better screen, but not by much, and that's about it. And the A71 is a downgrade."

Android,fqbqj44,t1_fqbl255,1589241978.0,All of the evidence of the device even existing is mostly speculation 😁
motorola,fqaq3pi,t1_fqagdxe,1589223334.0,"I'm going to be honest. A lot of people seem to have issues with them. I never have. I've ported in, out, and back in several times and it was always smooth. I've even gotten the prepaid MasterCards more than once without a hiccup (not on purpose lol). They are a test of Verizon's new cloud based network and therefore they don't have roaming capabilities.  It's all LTE and VOLTE and not all unlocked phones are supported even if they support Verizon, because they have to have a specific update that allows them to work with Visible specifically. With that being said I have used several phones successfully that wouldn't pass an IMEI check or aren't officially supported, so it's not that serious. They sometimes have connection issues but it's usually easily solved by toggling airplane mode. Also without any promotions their plan is only $40 a month but they also have this thing called a party that's basically like a family plan but you don't have to be family. You can have any random people in it you want and each person brings your bill down $5 so right now I have 3 random strangers in mine by sharing my link on the visible sub and my bill is only $25 a month. They used to have referral codes you could share that would get you credits too. For a while I had it so my girls bill was as low as $5 a month...... seriously. Last month because of credits they gave me for the current Corona situation mine was only $10. A lot of people claim bad customer service but I have never had a problem. They don't have a phone number but can very easily be accessed by a chat system and it's usually quick and painless. I returned a phone one time and it was a lot less painful than I thought it'd be. So yeah idk I enjoy them lol."
motorola,fqaezqr,t3_ggmta9,1589217944.0,You can get it at Visible for $336 and it's the Unlocked model they have. Also if you actually use Visible they will give you $200 in a prepaid MasterCard after two months. You don't necessarily have to use it online either. I very easily just transfered the money to my bank account with PayPal.

Android,fpy0k91,t1_fkn8388,1588993413.0,Completed agree and have been regurgitating this opinion everywhere but people are so conditioned to the current prices nobody really agrees. For example The Pixel 4 XL is not a damn sale @ $599 lol. That shit should have been that price brand new and a sale should be $399 or less.
fitbit,fpwxy6b,t1_fpwsc07,1588972006.0,My girl has a charge 2 and it doesn't have these issues. I know because I used hers for a while after she stopped lol
fitbit,fpwpf89,t1_fpwku31,1588967559.0,It just keeps getting worse and worse. I just noticed it counting one step as 3 over and over again. I'm definitely taking it back ehh
fitbit,fpw2vto,t1_fpvxx0e,1588956309.0,"Yeah that's fine, but if you start walking without interruption it shouldn't keep doing that. It should show in real time after that. Mine doesn't even do that. It's definitely going back to Walmart when I get a chance lol. I wonder how the inspire is."
fitbit,fpvtd93,t1_fpvl7jw,1588951478.0,Yeah it may be. I've actually been looking at it when I'm continually walking too and even then it doesn't seem to show my steps in real time like my girls charge 2 does or my previous watch/phone would do. It seems like it's attempting to but only ends up capable of counting in 2s or 3s before pausing again.
GooglePixel,fpvt3sy,t1_fpvbnh1,1588951343.0,"Yeah but even that, why do they announce a phone only a few days before release lol. I feel like other companies do it months ahead of time."
fitbit,fpvgcsx,t1_fpuyifl,1588944164.0,"For a watch what I said its doing, is pretty inaccurate. I may have been taking more than 20-30 steps I'm not sure, but mind you it didn't count them for the entire walk there and back so that's at least 60 it didn't count. Even the pedometers on my phone are a little better than that. It takes them 2-3 steps to start working. Furthermore I've previously owned a Galaxy watch active that was extremely accurate and also would start right away within 2-3 seconds and did not count steps while I was just sitting there. I ended up returning it because it was just doing too much other stuff other than health stuff and I realized I wasn't really interested in a smart watch since I'm on my phone all the time anyway. I think I might return this versa and try the inspire HR or the Galaxy fit. Maybe a Garmin device, idk."
fitbit,fpuqkqv,t3_gfmruf,1588920429.0,"I just got a versa lite and not finding it all that great. It has counted steps when I was just sitting on the couch, and NOT counted steps while walking back and forth in the house.

Moto_Z,fptw4iy,t1_fptvtx6,1588899455.0,"Yeah, that's how I got to 10. The update my software feature on it kept telling me I was up to date but I noticed the software version under the rescue my phone option was the same as 10 so I did that and it worked lol. Such a weird thing to have to do."

Moto_Z,fppgbbu,t1_fppfyk0,1588801748.0,"They do sell the unlocked model, however Visible uses a weird cloud based tst version of Verizon that requires special attention which is why when some other phones get updates they lose compatibility temporarily. I wasn't thinking about this in regards to updates, but if I'm to read between the lines of what the rep said to me, they are somehow pushing different updates to the Visible Z4 despite it being the same unlocked model.

I said ok, well then why is it at least not on the February patch then, and he just spoke something irrelevant I didn't understand. Also he said Android 10 would be read by ""half the year"". ......the hell? Lol I think I made a mistake seriously. I of course am aware Moto is bad with updates but it wasn't really bothering me because I thought I'd at least have Android 10."
