There is mindfulness practices where you focus yourself on the moment and what you're doing, and being in the same space as your activities mentally. There is also sensory meditation where you draw your mind to the present by noting what is happening in your environment thru sight, smell feel and sound and realize you're safe right now, even if you don't feel so.

As a woman, I am very diverse in my taste. As an artist, I draw women more traditional to anime style. I enjoy not sexualizing women, but the sexuality of women in general and their expression. He's not doing anything wrong. You may be trying to advocate women and trying to prevent objectification of women but... Seriously, does he treat you well? Is he respectful and kind and considerate? If he is, is this the hill to die on?

If it offends your sense of morality, leave. But often you will be hard pressed to find a man who doesn't have his idea of attraction and women do that too. They prefer certain body types, or whatever. Physical attraction happens in both genders and their definition of that varies. 

Art doesn't always reflect that definition.

Would you be as offended if he was painting naked, Renaissance stylized portraits? Those portraits defined the definition of beauty at the time.

I do think maybe this is a reflection of insecurities and you're taking it a bit far.

If you feel it is truly strictly morality, you should leave."

You did have communication issues, you see where you went wrong and what you did right. I cant fault you for any of that. She did seem to dump a lot of responsibility in your lap. So that being said, you seem to have a fairly clear view of what is wrong.


That being said.

Speaking as a woman with a man who has your sense of humor: I don't find it funny. At all. He hated my perverted sense of humor or kinky sense of humor and I hate his sense of humor which is like yours. We both found it incredibly offensive.

That also being said: we both had to accept a compromise. He needed me to stop it and I needed him to stop it. In a very general sense, morbid/perverted/dark/ect humor has a very specific time and place with specific people. I have heard people argue the N word is reserved for only ignorant people, regardless of race. It does not matter.

Part of growing is evolving and questioning how you were raised. Some things are just not okay to joke about around some people. It can actually be incredibly hurtful. Being a grown man, you have to recognize how that can be harmful to those around you, even if it sucks to accept. Part of your growth here is to understand that time and place, and company. Respectable women will very generally not be okay with that word or those jokes, most of the time.

It doesn't mean you have to change who you are.

It's growing enough to be considerate and aware of the impact it has on those around you, and respecting their feelings.

Wear what you will wear, and be who you are. But also recognize your actions have impact.

That being said you sound intelligent and very self aware. I'm proud of you for reflecting. You have a very sweet heart.

I kind of interpret that as you're seeking permission to do it anyway so you don't feel guilty. 

Even if it makes you a jerk, who cares? It's better to just go with what you want more, instead of trying to force something you're not feeling. It's too new for it to matter.

A) it could be the platform you're finding girls on (i.e. tinder, known for casual hookups) b) the conversation may be too generic with nothing to bond over c) it's the girls you find (girls who send nudes to handsome men tend to be looking for something casual, honestly. You can't really skip that step) d) they're intimidated/don't want it

Really, either which way it seems the bonding process itself is the issue. Bonding over mutual interests, hobbies, likes, passions, spiritual views, family views, building trust, getting to know each other. It seems like you go straight to the sexy but miss the crucial get-to-know you steps. I think if you're serious about wanting a long term relationship you may need to implement a 3 date rule and start with things like:

""What are your goals for the future. Where do you see yourself in 5 years? What are you looking for in a partner? What qualities do you find the most promising in a partner? What are your non negotiable boundaries in a relationship? What do you feel makes a good relationship thrive? How do you look to grow with a partner?"" Ect.

I think you need a clearly defined idea of what you want as it seems you're testing the waters a lot without a direction other than something long term.

The best thing to do is make sure you are not rebounding, and make sure you are considerate and in a place of making sure neither of you are hurt. You need clarity from him on what he wants. Not to mention, if your ex found out it would probably end in hurt feelings of betrayal by your ex, especially if he was friends with roommate too. He will feel betrayed by roommate, even if he was the one who was messing up. Hurt feelings with indeed abound.

That being said, this is all consensual and it is in your very best interest to not overthink this. If something developed naturally then legit. But you're still emotionally grieving your ex, I'm sure, and the full force of everything that happened may not have hit you yet. You need kid gloves on this."
