unpopularopinion,fhmvocg,t3_f3rrnb,1581718573.0,"Great post as it actually sparked discussion which is the point!

I might as well throw in my two cents: in my opinion, unless an individual is either a) in some type of law enforcement, or b) hunts to feed themself or their family/hunts to sell the animal products to make a living, I see absolutely no reason for anyone to own a gun. Unequivocally, pretty much without exception, period. No reason to own a gun. 

I say this because in my view, regardless if the gun is purchased legally/registered/kept locked up, it's a danger to society and absolutely a liability. In my opinion, human error is just too much of a problem to trust the general public with guns ""for protection"". More guns in the public equals more shootings and more deaths, accidental or not. Where there are guns, people will die, end of story. 

If my home gets invaded (which is quite rare if we're being honest with ourselves, although 100% depending on where you live), I will hide and call the police if I can, or just get out of the house if possible. I say this because if I had a gun to shoot the intruder, not only is there now a possibility that the intruder gets to the gun before I do and blows my head off, but there is also the possibility that I shoot and kill the intruder, which is now something I have to live with for the rest of my life. I understand that's a very personal opinion, and it may not bother others like it bothers me. However, I am not willing to introduce liability like that into my life, and I wish others weren't as well. In my mind, gun culture is about swinging your dick around and pretending you're better than everyone else because you have the means to swiftly end a human life. It's embarrassing for people who live and breathe gun culture. It's also fundamentally childish, because gun-loving individuals are more concerned about things like their rifle collection that they have no defendable and legitimate use for, than they are about the lives of innocent people around them when something goes wrong. I find it deplorable and utterly immature to throw temper tantrums because ""the government wants to take our guns away"", if the individual doesn't specifically use them for subsistence hunting or law enforcement. It's the ever-present culture of ""me, me, me, fuck everyone else, I want what I want and I'll do everything in my power to ruin your life if you try to take away my toy, I'm the most important person on the planet and only my opinion matters"". It seems to be quite prevalent in the States, but I'm not sure about other countries. 

My point of view!"
