Paranoia,fq4oecj,t1_fq4lq37,1589080462.0,"Its such a good movie. Defintely makes you take a step back and realize how fragile reality really is. 

About therapy, i know it can be hard but just know that your therapist has an outside view and hopefully unbiased view. Therapy is one of those things that takes time. If you have the means i would recommend going to therapy once a week for a few years. It can really help things. 

Weird that it happens in the evening...

Not that you will go to some asylum but asylums arent things to be afraid of. They are built for people who need extra help coping with things. Not something to be afraid of. It would probably by more like a safe place  where people can get help they need. 

Dont be afraid to tell your parents. Maybe write them a letter if its hard to talk about?"
Paranoia,fq4k518,t3_ggrk7f,1589078780.0,"I was going to say to see a doctor but i would definitely tell your parents if you are younger. Tell them that you hear things, tell them that it scares you. If they dont believe you keep bringing it up. 

Side note... if you have netflix theres an awesome movie on there called my beautiful broken brain about a woman who had a seizure and was left unable to speak or read or write. She also had things in her vision on her right side(like the right eye saw things). This is her story of how her life was changed and she had some scary things happen to her and paranoia and she kept sane by recording it and watching it later. 

Keep in mind that the brain is an imperfect thing and sometimes it makes you believe something that isnt actually happening. Talk yourself through it. You are okay. You are safe. Give yourself care and attention when scary things happen and be kind to yourself.

Best of luck"
