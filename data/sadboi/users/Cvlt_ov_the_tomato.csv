medicine,flmmsh2,t3_fple1o,1585288582.0,"I've had Kaiser for years. Usually without issue, felt the doctor's whom I had were great. 

The infrastructure and scheduling management is still done on something that looks like it was out of the nineties, and they heavily rely on an extremely strict hierarchy of care. But otherwise, many good doctors/nurses.

However this crap is unbelievable. It's like they're actual doctors taking medical advice from Trump's Twitter feed."
COVID19,fljham2,t1_fljab9o,1585212522.0,"Yeah, and since we have not seen evidence of no reinfection from COVID19 in people who test positive in an antibody ELISA. We can't say yet that a single blood test confers immunity. 

Seroconversion =/= immunity

Seeing antibodies is what we would expect, but again we need evidence to say that an ELISA supports a claim of immunity.

I agree that HIV is odd, but I was merely using it to point to an example of where we can't reject a null hypothesis. Since we don't entirely know how COVID19 works, we can't say for sure what the immune response from an antibody test means.

There are a range of different antibodies that the body will produce, and not all of them necessarily mean that t-cell memory will be induced. 

Edit: there was a recent study done with macaques showing no reinfection so again it's likely an antibody titer may prove that. But they didn't test the macaques with an ELISA, and I want to see it in humans to believe it."
COVID19,flj7vcr,t1_flhbxh3,1585201793.0,"They're not immune to the virus, which is why they still have the illness even with antibodies. The same can be said for Lyme disease

Antibody production merely means the immune system is responding, it doesn't necessarily mean you have full immunity.

If you're antibody positive, antigen negative, and show no signs of the virus -- then I'd believe that they're immune."
COVID19,flh77f6,t1_flfwq7o,1585157354.0,"Antibody tests don't necessarily confer immunity. Virtually every HIV patient produces anti-HIV antibodies. 

We need to see evidence of antibody expression and immune response before we can tell anything from a COVID19 titer."

Antibodies produced also doesn't necessarily mean immunity."

COVID19,flfutzg,t1_flfub1e,1585118654.0,"Course, it's basically immune rejection. 

Although foreign matched plasma has the best chance of reducing that reaction in a recipient, it can still happen. 

You reduce the risk further by moving to polyclonal antibodies and even further with monoclonal ones, as the material is more pure."
COVID19,flfudkq,t1_flfsoht,1585118143.0,"There actually is now. I don't know how widely available it is, but I would check with your doctor in a week or so. 

Hope for your speedy recovery!"
COVID19,flftff7,t1_flfkvnk,1585117132.0,"That would be a polyclonal drug actually. In that case you isolate the actual antibodies themselves. 

This article is just describing using the survivor plasma. They're not actually purifying it.

What I'm guessing they're doing here, as COVID19 titering just came online. Is they're using ""known survivor"" plasma and matching it with a donor."
COVID19,flfsutx,t1_flfl8jh,1585116545.0,"Depends how you QC it.Titering the blood against SARS-CoV-2 is a simple ELISA pulldown (which has just been made available). Just saying you are using survivor match plasma is the next best thing.

It's how you ensure your batch-to-batch is consistent that's a harder question, and might be a little futile if you're just trying to use survivor plasma. 

Part of the issues with survivor blood serum is that there could be a range of different polyclonal antibodies produced. This adds variability to your potency (and also chance of immunogenic rejection, as the material is far from pure)."
COVID19,flfsgek,t1_flfk3py,1585116137.0,"Using survivor plasma has been tried in nearly every outbreak. And thankfully blood titering for COVID19 is now a thing, so we have another way to see immunity post-infection and whose not. 

It's not a long term solution, as the efficacy of such treatments are questionable given the batch to batch variability of plasma serum, and presents several dangers of it's own with greater degree of immunogenic responses as the material is far from pure.

Using polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies is far superior, though that takes time to develop."
