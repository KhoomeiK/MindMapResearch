AskWomenOver30,fqobloc,t3_gjvsdq,1589511636.0,"I never dreamed of being a mom when I was a child. It did not appeal to me. My partner and I only talked seriously about pursuing having biological children for a brief time a few years after marriage. It just wasn't for us at that time.

As I got older I was diagnosed with various illnesses that would make parenthood difficult and learned of family illness I would not want to pass on. I was diagnosed around age 25 with the most debilitating of my illnesses. My husband and I decided pretty early that if we wanted children, we would adopt older kids from foster care.

We both have nieces/nephews. We both have some horrendous family medical histories. We both feel the world has enough humans, so lets take care of the ones that already exist instead of making more. I felt no pressure about getting older and having my biological clock running down. If and when we were ready to be parents, we would adopt.

One of the upsides is older kids don't have the same physical demands as younger kids. Another upside is no commitment if the child is not a good fit with your family. Also, foster parents usually get a per diem to take care of the child. So no financial hardship while adjusting to new parenthood.

The biggest challenge is foster kids have been through major trauma. It's a lot of emotional work to parent a traumatized child. They usually require a lot of therapy, doctor visits, and medications. It is heartbreaking work to help heal their hurts.

We adopted a teenager and it has been a very worthwhile experience. If you can re-imagine what family means to you, adopting an older child might be a good fit for your family. I am her mom in every way that matters and I wouldn't change it for the world.

Parenting is not for everyone. My partner is a more nurturing person and I come from a difficult family background. Between the two of us we have a lot of tools to help our daughter reach a successful adulthood. In some ways, I think being a stable, reliable, and predictable parent is more important to a traumatized child than being the outwardly affectionate ""ideal"" that most people believe in.

Before I became a parent, the only good reason I ever came up with for wanting to be a parent is ""I want that relationship"". In reality, parenting has helped me grow in so many ways.

As far as long term goes, every kid is different, so this may not apply to you. Our adopted daughter was around 12 when we met and she does not like to be parented. She is the oldest of multiple siblings and was used to being in charge, since the birth parents were somewhat checked-out. We give her plenty of room to make her own choices, but always emphasize safety whenever we need to put boundaries in place. It makes her uncomfortable to be shown affection and uncomfortable to be praised. We keep doing it as lightly as possible or in round about ways. Being in foster care at an older age really messed with her sense of self worth. She was (mostly) fully aware of what was happening and why. She made poor choices (understandably) and had several broken placements. Working through the psychological trauma and the extreme need for control have been some of our biggest challenges. Psychotherapy has been a huge help. She did group therapy with girls her age. We've also done summer camp geared towards foster kids and summer camps working with animals.

Older kids are great because once you earn their trust, they are better able to let you know what they are thinking. You can really work together to heal their trauma and help set them up for a more successful, happier life. Best of luck!"
