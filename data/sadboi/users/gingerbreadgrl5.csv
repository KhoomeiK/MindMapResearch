Nothing wrong with that. I’d say take a class or two at a local community college. I dropped out my first semester after high school due to anxiety and then went back the next semester and took one class. It helped ease me in. Then the next semester after that I took a full time course load. It’s ok to start off slow.

You were raising a child at a young age with anxiety, that is a job in itself and very commendable. I think you are already heading on the right track. You’re still so young. I’m 25 and I took longer than most people to get my life on track. I have anxiety as well which made me take longer to accomplish things like getting my drivers license, getting my first job, graduating. I had some family members not understand why it took me so long to get my drivers license. I felt very embarrassed but what I’ve realized is not everyone understands what other people go through. It’s ok to not be “on the same pace” as others. We all face different problems. Don’t feel embarrassed. And you’re on the right path. I think education would be a great choice. Nursing could be another option too if you’re interested in health care."
