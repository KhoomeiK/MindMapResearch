https://youtu.be/RFBig17fARQ

But I digress üòÅ. I'm the oldest of 4 boys , now men. I am Afro-Latino but most ppl just assume I'm 100% Black, which is cool. Both of my parents are from Honduras and came here in 1986, the year I was born. I lived in East New York Brooklyn until about age eight, moved to Bushwick. Spanish was spoken at home mainly, but I learned english via osmosis through daycare/elementary, both predominately Black Spaces.

From elementary through high school, it was confusing. I never quite fit in with the Black crowd, which consisted of 12 students(not a joke, magnet school, Hunter College High School, upper east side üòë). I was very naive when it came to race. My mom is 50% black (My dad 100%) , but my mom passes for Latinx or even Southeast Asian somehow, so I never really felt racism as harshly when we would go out to do family things. Dad wasn't in the picture so I never got ""The Talk"" . Trial by fire for me, often faced alone. 

 Among Latinx(lighter skins) , didn't fit In there either. There weren't many either at school. Rest of the school was clueless, couldn't find Honduras on a map, heavy focus on European history üòë, so my time there growing as a person, was a wash.

At church and social events that we went to with our mom, which were predominantly Latinx with little to no Afro-Latinx presrnce, I felt pressure to speak Spanish, and I took great pains to speak it better than most, which has acted as a ""Golden ticket"" of sorts, and let's me into Latinx spaces , people's homes,  that were normally closed off vs. when I chose to strictly dialogue in english. The double-edged sword of this deeper access is that I became privy to conversations revolving around race/identity.

Although I didn't know the term at the time, ""mejorar la raza""(better the race) type thinking was pervasive, in EVERYTHING. If you were a darker skinned Latinx, there was almost an unspoken (but well understood) rule , that you downplay your Blackness, and try to emulate lightskin(""white"") beauty standards.  The mindfuck is that they(ignorants) would say they are not racist, but will talk big shit if say, you decide to get a more Afro-centric hairstyle , take pride in being Black , pick a darker partner over a lighter one, wearing FUBU , etc. Insanity.  Honestly, I avoid those spaces/people for sanity sake, now but didn't have much choice as a kid/teen. 

After doing 8 years in the military, living all over the US, meeting Black Folk from other cities, and seeing that we all go through the same shit, and see the world/joke/laugh the same way, I've slowly come full circle. Like shit, what was I doing ""over there"" this whole time üòù? 

I am a Afro-Latino, but I just say I'm Black. Once I moved out of mom's house, that little ""safety blanket"" of protection was gone, and life forced me to grow up and experience life as the world sees me. 

Felt like I over-shared or whatever. Wasn't born conscious and I'm not gonna front like that. This is but a snippet of my life's journey. Peace and God Bless."
