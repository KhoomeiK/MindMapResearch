Anxiety,fljn2it,t1_flio85k,1585219591.0, the source of my anxiety is my dad. He's a good person but is a short tempered. He used to shout a lot when I was a kid to the point that I was scared of him.

NarcissisticAbuse,fa8v15w,t1_fa82n23,1575855393.0,"Hi, there was no routine as such but I spent an awful lot of timing watching YouTube videos, making notes in my book.

To answer your next question, I have to see him and his new supply every day since they are my co workers. So ya😂😂 that in a way helped, it was definitely tough but after a year it feels okay. Im changing jobs next year anyway so I won't have to see them ever in my life again.

Goals I set in life was to not be dependent on anyone for my happiness. Validation must come from within rather than external. And biggest lesson I learnt is not to rush in relationships and friendships. 

Hope that helps.💓💓"

NarcissisticAbuse,fa4yv6v,t1_fa4wvfb,1575809949.0,Even I used to check my Nex social media but his account is private so I don't see his updates anymore.
NarcissisticAbuse,fa4uy42,t1_fa4uc4a,1575808759.0,I feel the same. My Nex is with the new supply right now and shes providing him with a the supply needed right now. Thank God
NarcissisticAbuse,fa4tn4f,t1_fa4sg74,1575808319.0,"Exactly. When you are within the bubble of being abused, you never realise it because the moment we were on the verge of breaking out of it, the narcissist pushes us back in through sweet lies and love bombing, so we never actually step out of it until the bubble breaks and we see it from the outside."

And plus he was ridiculously charming and really attractive. 
I was the perfect victim."

You shouldn't have a problem but
I love you you are the love of my life""
Lol. Its funny how we missed all the obvious signs because we were so blinded by the love bombing."

""Well maybe it's me and my blind optimism to blame
Maybe it's you and your sick need to give love then take it away

Anxiety,f3os13j,t1_f3oqrql,1571026726.0,What you believe you are. Do you think you're a good person? Look inside and ask yourself what you think of yourself. And hold on to it.

The moment I feel like I'm relapsing, I immediately distract my self with either a movie or watch some funny YouTube videos. I know this may feel like a temporary cure, but it works.
