MtF,fr4m2wd,t1_fr1qov6,1589891907.0,"Well, for one thing, in all seriousness, a great many of us (women with this condition) would prefer not to undergo such invasive, intensive, and expensive surgery that has several risks of complications and a possibility of diminshed sensation, etc. regardless and irrespective of our sexual role inclination or preferences. This subreddit might give a skewed view one way or another at times, but in any case I really feel like the centrality/importance of vaginoplasty to the condition, and prevalence of severe ""genital dysphoria"" in mostly stably ""transitioned"" women is somewhat overblown still, in mainstream perception.

So that could explain why some who identified as ""bottoms"" here responded that they didn't want it. As far as why so many *versus* self-IDed ""tops"" IDed that way, and ""tops"" said they want it, well, that's where in part I suspect several probably interpreted ""top"" as referring to a sexual role in a more general and specifically-""BDSM"" context rather than the simple penetrative sense you primarily intended it to refer to. Plus, there are likely a handful of women here who responded ""top and want it"" because they've lived falsely as men in pseudo-heterosexual relationships with cis women until coming to terms with their actual gender recently (this sub also tends IMO to skew heavily towards those early-in-actualization/'transition') and were responding from the standpoint of their actual/typical practices/role up until the present rather than their ideal role in the future necessarily. And finally, there are some women who have a glib/blase sort of attitude to the effect that they might as well ""use the parts they have"" in that manner until surgery, which they do want ultimately anyway. Out of all, personally I understand and empathize with the latter the least, as I just find it to be a strange and sort of offputtingly cavalier self-objectifying attitude, but that's just me--point is, plenty do exist with that perspective.

Regardless, one aspect/takeaway (IMHO) here is that the whole ""top/bottom/vers"" schema doesn't reveal much about, and isn't terribly meaningful when applied to, in itself, trans women's sexualities and ideal bodily self-images given the complexities involved. That's a rather reductive schema that is much more rooted in and broadly applicable on its surface to gay/bi men's sexual identities than ours. I mean, just for example, my personal deal there is such that I'll pick ""top"" over ""bottom"" or ""vers"" when forced to choose between only those options, but primarily when it comes to most preferred practices, I'm really neither/none, more ""sideways"" (and without elaborating I'll leave it to you to figure out what that might mean, hm, as discussing this stuff is already a sensitive/delicate topic area for me as it is). I'm not sexually active and haven't been for a long time, but referring to ideal/hypothetically preferred activities and in past relationships and experiences. So, I don't think the ""top/bottom/vers"" thing really captures the range of practices and roles etc. of trans female sexuality. Again, the kind of straightforwardly penetrative sexual act(s) that schema is based upon are far more commonly central/primary/important to men's sexualities/sexual lives than ours. To be uncharacteristically blunt about it."
TrueCrime,fr45oh6,t3_gm9q26,1589876690.0,"Personally, not as much with more contemporary cases, because everyone has for multiple generations at this point been well aware of the dangers various predatory/criminal types present, precautionary measures of various kinds have long permeated into mainstream culture in this paranoid/neurotic era, and many high-profile modern cases involve factors well and truly out of victims' control, but I do often marvel in hindsight at how much more socially open, trusting, and therefore vulnerable society and people were from the mid-late 20th century and back. So in those older famous cases, yes. 

That hitchhiking was ever popular and ubiquitously accepted as a viable mode of travel for young people, for example, is difficult for me to grasp and registers reflexively as bizarrely risky (as does the practice particularly in small towns of 'never locking doors' etc.), as a last-wave Millennial who grew up in a world awash in pervasive/omnipresent concern for personal safety and crime prevention (in large part as a result of those cases--AFAIK, again for this example, hitchhiking fell out of favor in large part due to the numerous abductions/rapes/assaults/murders involving it), and who was from as early as I can remember warned by my parents, teachers, etc. of ""stranger danger"", CSA, the potential of being taken advantage of in general, and instilled with a sense of certain cautious ways of conducting oneself in public and approaching the unfamiliar, and so forth and so on. (Which makes sense as my parents grew up in statistically a far more dangerous era with significantly higher violent crime rates. And my father was himself, I suspect/know, a quasi-sociopathic perpetrator/predator in various ways who bullied, robbed, scammed and generally took advantage of vulnerable people and society's greater trust, so he was in a perfect position to know, and I eventually got the impression that his constant warnings to the point of paranoia about certain things were in part derived from his past perpetrating those very same crimes/forms of victimization in his youth!)

But one remembers that, indeed, coverage and awareness of crime in the media and so on resulted in those societal/cultural changes, hindsight is indeed 20/20, and I have mixed and mostly negative/lamentation feelings about what we've lost in a hyper-aware, hyper-neurotic world of mistrust by default, and reflect on the cost of that increased (or simply increased perception of) safety/security."
TrueCrime,fr444em,t3_gmfa9l,1589875146.0,"It's complex, but one take on this is that the cultural zeitgeist shifted for many broad-ranging and overlapping/interconnected reasons away from archetypal ""lone wolf"" mysterious serial killers (in media portrayals and primacy in public consciousness, etc.) towards, for instance, mass shootings and such, and one might speculate that the types of offenders/perpetrators in the general demographic and psychopathology who might've been inclined to become serial killers (angry, frustrated young men with Cluster B personality disorders, for example) in another era may instead tend to channel their warped/deviant energies into mass/spree killing acts that garner more and more guaranteed attention/infamy/'legendary' status because they've grown up immersed in a media milieu (and come of age in an unprecedentedly media-saturated/influenced era compared to killers of decades past--24-hour news cycle, internet, social media, etc.) where those types of criminal acts have been more prominently visible and thus have held more sway and more effectively terrorized the public and immediately impacted the world. 

I'm sure there are those whose psychopathology would lead them into serial killing regardless of this and irrespective of external influences, but I find this hypothesis somewhat plausible at least if only related to the potential vague subconscious influence those sociocultural factors might exert upon people potentially capable of committing multiple/several murders.  

Perhaps the psychopathological trends/tendencies of modern/current serial killers have morphed a bit as a result of this as well--could be that those more likely to become serial killers in the last few decades tend to be more secretive and compulsion/gratification-driven rather than attention-seeking and bearing generalized 'repressed rage' (if you buy into the notion that that sort of thing drives SKs, to begin with). If Ed Kemper was to have come into his own today, for example, with the same factors in his psyche, he might well have become one of those mass-shooters who were openly motivated by misogyny rather than a serial killer who murdered imagined effigies of his mother over and over again. I also don't think we'd ever see anything like a Zodiac ever again, as that serial killer was so obviously influenced and to a large extent motivated by the zeitgeist and media attention focused on SKs at the time."
MtF,fr00jzw,t1_fqxtjfz,1589780260.0,"The thing is, this survey would be mangled from the get-go because ""top"" and ""bottom"" are extremely confusingly ambiguous terms with so many different meanings depending upon one's psychosexual paradigm/perspective/etc.  

But that all aside, though I was in a vulnerable place yesterday and genuinely upset by it, today I have to just laugh: when you think about it, I'll bet there are far more girls on here actually in the category I voted in (which I assume you can discern, you know which one I'm talking about, and assuming the most...erm, crude/simplistic interpretation of 'top' and 'bottom'), but they're reticent to admit it, even on an ostensibly anonymous survey, because it's embarrassing/unexpected/runs contrary to narratives about the condition/is unpopular.  ( So you're right, that doesn't exactly make sense, and it's obvious people interpreted the terms, shall we say, ""conveniently"". ;-) )In fact, I *know* there are from reading prior threads, that uh...we are a lot more common than that.  But something about a survey starkly makes one face it and there's a phenomenon where people hedge and respond in shame, inaccurately and abashedly.  It'd be like giving teenagers or professionals who work in a respected field a survey about drug use--I take those results with a grain of salt too, for the same reason, hahaha.  ;-P  It's just as loaded a subject if not more.  I was just the honest one b/c, (as my post history indicates, haha) I have nothing to lose there.  I'm an outsider's outsider in any trans-related ""community"" anyhow.  Got a giggle out of it, anyway.

""Hmm...this survey asks if I'm a ""top""...uhh...well...y'know what I'm gonna interpret that to mean in a 'kink'/BDSM context..."" and ""Have I ingested cocaine in the past year?  Well, uhm...y'know what, no, because 'ingest'...that must mean digestive system, and I sniffed it, didn't swallow it, so I'm gonna say *no*...""

Edit: Having the 'vers' option is hilarious too in how it gave the perfect out.  Speaks volumes that that was the second most popular option.

Just some food for thought for when you design your next survey, lol."

Transmedical,fqp4ngc,t3_gggqf5,1589534875.0,"I'm probably going to be pilloried here for saying this, but as a resolutely non-op woman, I vehemently disagree that this is a problem in itself.  Sure, some people in the more frivolous sides of the ""community"" approach this in a somewhat boorish and excessively flippant/glib way that is self-defeating and plays into the backlash, but with how I frame this condition and what I envision for the ideal direction of a ""rights movement"" around it--in short, that it's akin to intersex conditions and that the end goal is to be fully accepted in society as members of our actual, *binary* sex without our defective/""mismatched"" genitalia and affected bodies undermining that, and I strongly feel also, as the intersex movement traditionally has, that we shouldn't be pressured or required to get invasive surgeries to be accepted as our actual gender, that genitalia we were born with as a result of a medical condition and had no choice in should not cause us to be seen as androgynous freaks or the wrong (non-brain) sex--this message is pretty much the crux of all I wish mainstream society would understand/accept about our condition: that it affects the genitalia we have/were born with, but *that's all*.  

It disheartens me greatly that the trans movement swung from one unfortunate extreme (neurotic self-loathing and self-apologetic transsexuals who by and large upheld the narrative/paradigm that gender/sex was all about genitalia and that surgery was necessary to be authentic as one's actual gender, and/or who saw themselves as ""Other"", never *fully/truly* their actual gender on par with cis people but just needing to live as such to ""be happy"" etc.) to another (the nonbinary gender BS, and the whole prevailing gender-relativist it's-all-a-social-construct identity-politics confused mangled post-postmodernist mess that predominates the narrative today and has for the past decade) while totally skipping over what I see as the sane, genuine and most accurate/fitting, reasonable and sensible perspective in the middle, to the effect of ""like intersex people, we have a rare likely neurodevelopmental condition that results in being born with atypical genitalia, though in our case fully-formed genitalia of the sex we aren't in actuality, according to our brains, so, we illustrate that sex/gender is neurological and not indicated in every case--though most cases, yes--by genital morphology"".  The succinctly-summarized, sloganized, sound-bite version of that is pretty much, indeed ""some women have penises and some men have vaginas as a result of a rare medical condition, transsexualism/transsexuality, but that doesn't and shouldn't affect perception/acceptance of us as full, 'complete', real, binary women and men, respectively, and since we are truly the sex our genitals don't usually indicate and we couldn't help but be born with this condition, we deserve every right and privilege legally/socially afforded all other members of our sex/gender with sex-typical genitals"".  Pared down even further, you get ""some women have penises and some men have vaginas"".  

If the ""trans movement"" consisted of *just* that message at the core, without all this gender-is-all-a-relative-spectrum ""identity"" crap, I'd be perfectly content, and would have nothing to object to in its direction and narrative/framework.

The way the gender-relativist (non-medical-oriented) side is deploying this message currently certainly isn't helping at all, but I can't get on board with the obvious contempt OP has for transsexual bodies, either.  Again, I point to the intersex rights movement--though being obnoxious about it and bandying it about to challenge the whole framework of sex/gender is flatly the wrong way to go, I don't believe that we should have to apologize for a condition that shaped our bodies and in particular that aspect (genitals) in a way we had no control over prenatally, or see it as something that needs to be ""fixed"" with what amounts to invasive cosmetic surgery in order to look physically typical and thus be accepted as the sex we really are, even if it is, like IS conditions, a ""fuckup by nature"".  It's a defect, yes, but amounts to a difference we didn't have a say in, like IS conditions or congenital disabilities or whatever have you, so I don't think it's inherently wrong-minded or obnoxious or whatever to perhaps embrace that difference for ourselves and see it as not-necessarily-negative under the overarching perspective of ""trans women *are just women* and trans men *are just men* with this one difference, physical abnormality, that's all it is"".  When properly treated with HRT to ensure the proper development of secondary sex characteristics, as in IS conditions this does more-or-less amount to just a ""special quirk"", like any other marked physical difference/deviation/abnormality is a ""special quirk"".  I don't want to be Othered, that's the thing--the way the current trans ""community/movement"" is conveying this message is Othering, gleefully--the emphasis is on ""some women *have penises*, teehee, and are thus special and Different!""--but disavowing this message totally and being self-apologetic about the condition is othering too.  The right message as I see it is ""some women just have penises, y'know, but we're still women like every other woman is, just our bodies are slightly different in this/these ways, that's all.""  

Though impossible in this climate with how everything unfolded, and while I'm ambivalent as a result of my essentialist/Idealist philosophical beliefs and seeing how this has been taken too far in every area, with every physical ""difference"" from weight to disability to our deal to whatever--part of me deep down really does wish that we could reach a point where (*reinforcing*, if anything, mind you, not undermining or picking apart the concept of binary sex/gender, and that it's medical and not subjective in nature) we could begin, as a culture, to celebrate or at least accept/embrace the difference in a way, even if it is the result of a developmental defect.  I don't want my body type to be framed as freakishly malformed and so repulsive it can only be acknowledged in hushed tones as inherently awaiting/requiring a surgical correction.  And I'm the furthest thing from a gender-relativist, non-medicalist, ""transgender"" activist you could ever find, but I think other ""women with penises"" can be just as femininely physically beautiful and embodying womanhood without that difference affecting it at all, not *in spite of* or *because of* it, but it just being a trait like hair color or height/weight etc., and I firmly believe that women with penises should be able to have the right F sex marker on all legal documents, etc., should have equal and unfettered access to all sex-segregated spaces, be jailed with other women when charged with a  crime, and so forth and so on, just as women with streak gonads or unusually shallow vaginas or undescended testes and vulvae or whatever else as a result of an IS condition should be treated.  I wish people understood that that's all it is functionally speaking at the end of the day, we're not androgyne/'nonbinary'/third-sex beings who challenge, disrupt or are a threat in any way to the very concept of sex/gender, we're not men who resemble and act like women, it *doesn't* have any affect on ""personality"", we're not repulsive freaks nor some Ideal perfect sexually-immaculate specimens of hybrid-women, we're just...women with penises--at least, women who were born with them and had them at some point in our lives or always will.  Look at how women with AIS and Swyer syndrome and so forth conceptualize themselves--it should be the same for us, our condition just results in male-typical external genitalia as opposed to ambiguous or female-typical external genitals.  Plenty of those women with those conditions don't feel that they should have to have surgeries to accept themselves or be accepted full stop by others as binary/""normal"" women, and just see their resultant physical abnormalities as ""flukes/quirks"" etc.

Sorry for the lengthy rant I guess, but this really does get to me, that women like myself with this framing end up voiceless and getting Othered and dismissed from all sides, as the gender-relativist identity-politics people undermine our womanhood by touting and construing our bodies as ""breaking the binary""/challenging gender norms--that we're freaks but that's *good*, in other words--and other transsexuals who recognize it as a medical condition conceptualize un-surgically-modified transsexual bodies as defective and freakish but that that's *bad*, and in inherent need of ""correction"", who at base accept the premise that being a woman with a penis (for instance) ""breaks the binary"" but disparage that as a result.  I'd love to know where all the other ""transmedicalist"" transsexuals are who simply *don't see* women's penises and men's vaginas as ""transgressive"", ""defective"" or w/e but simply, indeed, merely a physical ""quirk""/difference as a result of the condition that doesn't and shouldn't affect our gender any which way.

Technically speaking, there is a minute statistical chance that any given girl will ""emerge from the womb"" with apparently-male external genitalia, just as there is x% chance of any given girl having an IS condition, that's what transsexuality *is*, how is that ""just ridiculous"" or saying anything in itself about personality?  I don't think it's healthy or accurate to see it as a special Identity, but neither do I think it's healthy to frame it as inherently ""cringeworthy"", and don't see how seeing it in somewhat-positive, ""shiny Pokemon"" (i.e. ""girls with penises can be just as or more beautiful/valid"" etc.) terms is necessarily mutually exclusive with a medical-condition framework."
BPD,fqozh78,t3_gjwpqx,1589529707.0,"Going on amphetamines a couple years back drastically changed my life--BPD-wise for the better as the emotional-numbing properties sent my BPD symptoms to the background and made it possible to function in isolation with tumult in my family's lives transpiring around me.  Before amphetamines I was anything but ""quiet"", and my BPD symptoms were extremely prominent all day every day, and after amphetamines I became essentially a ""quiet borderline""--it feels like emotional, internal armor in dialing down that inner sensitivity.  Amphetamines have also rendered my emotional baseline state far less reliant upon other people and their actions day to day, which was absolutely necessary at the phase of my life I went on them (continuing up through the present day), by providing an exogenous dopamine boost of confidence and contentment at baseline that allowed me to weather the turmoil of interactions with other people a bit better--it sort of feels like they give me more ""padding""/insulation in a sense, as without them I'm a completely exposed live wire."
TrueCrimeDiscussion,fqoyj6p,t3_gjx3z7,1589528827.0,"A few miscellaneous thoughts; I followed this story closely as it unfolded:

* Her website was interesting, and haunting, and resonant.  She had a picture of herself as a little girl on there and vaguely mused ""how did I get from there, to here..."", gave me chills.

* It was a little odd/disturbing how closely the handwriting in the journal pages she posted resembled Klebold's from those journals...it was so close I felt like she had to have been intentionally mimicking it.

* Supposedly she made threats on some other platform, and if that's true I can sort of see why it blew up in the media the way it did, but I'd like to see that evidence and I wonder how specific it really was.  From what I saw on her website etc., there wasn't anything that screamed ""actual threat"".  At the time and in the absence of such evidence of actual threats being made, I can't help but feel like the media handled this inappropriately and unfairly characterized/disparaged this girl: it's not illegal or a threat to anyone else to travel across the country and commit suicide with a shotgun in the wilderness somewhere.  I perceived a lost soul in desperate need of mental health/crisis intervention who I could empathize with, not a would-be attacker who was ever a serious threat, and the way the media ran with and construed the story seemed like an ill-conceived rush to judgment and totally lacking in empathy and sensitivity.  The timing, the oblique Columbine references, yeah, okay...I can see why that would be concerning but to be splashed all over national news as ""armed and dangerous"" was the last thing Pais needed in the throes of such a crisis.

* Apparently she had already had a child?  I wonder if she had custody, how old her child was, what happened after her death, the reaction of the child's father to it all, what his role in her life was, etc."

When I take my meds (daily mood stabilizer and a stimulant, usually amphetamines) consistently and am not experiencing a major hypomanic or depressive episode, or emotional crisis (comorbid BPD), sometimes I can focus enough to function on ""everyday life"", but it's spotty.  Nicotine I've found helps me hone my chaotic internal thought-landscape enough to get things done, so for that reason it's invaluable to me, and it's the one thing that has worked best for my executive function."
Schizotypal,fpjicpu,t3_gc7zln,1588669608.0,"Poll closed, but I'm almost certain I inherited it from my father's side of the family, which is a complete black box mystery as my father was adopted at birth.  The particular murky circumstances surrounding his birth/adoption--he was born in a state hospital and taken into state custody/the foster system immediately, went through a few failed carers before being adopted out--given the time period and etc., have led me to believe that his birth mother (my paternal grandmother) was most likely schizophrenic or on the schizo- spectrum severely in some way.  My father, for all his mental illnesses, wasn't on the schizo- spectrum himself as far as I or anyone could tell, but I would be very surprised if there isn't a family history of schizo- conditions on his side."

I suppose I feel a sort of kinship with them in certain ways, as they're extremely misunderstood, considered almost univerally repulsive and frightening on a flimsy basis, and they tend to be reclusive, nocturnal and scurry and hide in encounters with humans more often than not.  I don't understand why so many people so fear a creature that tends to be extremely skittish and dash away to hiding places when confronted with human beings--from the way people respond to them, you'd think spiders aggressive by nature, and they just aren't.  Most serious bites happen with people unwittingly stumble right into their spaces--like putting boots on that brown recluses have taken up residence in, etc.-but from the way most people respond, you'd think spiders prone to jumping on people and biting them out of nowhere or running *towards* people, but they nearly always run quickly away.

I strongly suspect that with modern psychology still being in its relative infancy and understanding of personality disorders all the more so, that many if not most of the PD categories actually encompass multiple distinct (though related) conditions that present with similar symptomology ""on paper"" according to the (very broad) diagnostic criteria but that can actually lead to very different symptoms and life impacts in practice in daily life.

AskReddit,fp8wvp5,t1_fp8wu5a,1588405821.0,"(cont.)

I flunked out of nearly a whole semester (bunch of squandered inheritance there, good grief) because I just stopped going to class, and would dutifully take the lunches my SO packed and spend all day holed up reading and browsing the internet in little cubicles in the library.  The only class I got an A- in was Intro to Creative Writing--I actually missed the final, but I guess the instructor gave me an A- anyway because I'd already had work accepted to a couple relatively well-known-in-their-niche literary journals at that point.  
Dropped out in 2014, and all my vague aspirations of an academic career--all I'd ever considered I'd ever do with my life professionally--were dashed permanently just like that.  

Today, I'm as complete a societal failure as you could possibly imagine--I'm 26, divorced at 22 (I was an extremely and horribly abusive partner, and my wonderful ex fortunately was able to escape fairly quickly as far as those relationships go) suffering immensely from all of those mental illnesses/disabilities listed above, living in my mom's basement and receiving SSI disability benefits (was approved in Nov 2018).  I've been hospitalized inpatient five times that I can remember and have been on and off psych meds reaching well into the double digits.  Returning to school is unfathomable at this point, I'll probably never have an actual job, a major component of my psych treatment is up in the air as of this moment and I had to accept the reality of my life and limitations a long time ago.  I've had a little creative writing published here and there and caught the attention of certain niche poetry communities, have gone to conventions/conferences related thereto, etc., and still have some literary promise that I hope to actualize someday soon here, but that's about it, all my mark on the world will realistically ever amount to (though I do have several impassioned interests and side-projects I've been meaning to do, but who knows if they'll ever come to fruition before I eventually suicide, OD or whathaveyou).  I wouldn't wish the hell of living with these conditions on my worst enemy.  

So there's the long version of that bleak story.  While I never quite reached ""prodigal"" levels of ""gifted"" and consistently underachieved relative to my ability throughout, I honestly think I had the potential (and drive, in early childhood for sure) to do so, I could've perhaps been a Barbara Newhall Follett type had it been properly managed and cultivated in a better, more intellectually-oriented (my mom was always supportive, but bless her, she's far from an intellectual or ""gifted"" herself) nurturing and stable household.  That's something I've had to come to peace with and am gradually learning to let go--though I know it breaks my mom's heart to acknowledge this, she has--my potential was definitely stunted because I was raised by depressive dropout potheads (and my dad was abusive and truly insane) who tried their best, sort of, but couldn't begin to foster my aptitudes/talents/interests on their own and with the life/survival challenges and everything else essentially left me to my own devices at a crucial developmental stage, assuming I'd be fine in the end.  (As unpopular as I know it'll be, I say ""potheads"" pointedly because their cannabis use *was* unhealthy and did detrimentally impact me growing up--e.g., I once missed a piano recital I'd practiced intensely for for months and looked forward to because they got stoned out of their minds and spent the night thereof watching old horror movies, totally spacing it.)  Had I grown up in the household environment so many of my peers in the ""gifted"" program had--two sane, functional, intellectual and/or professional, responsible parents well established in the community who took an active role in nurturing my education and intellectual life outside of school--I really do think I could've soared so much higher far earlier on.

If I could do it all over again, knowing that my mental illnesses would inevitably set in in young adulthood regardless, I would have attained my GED as soon as possible (I probably could've on the first try beginning of freshman year, tbh), and gone straight into a two-year community college instead of going to HS at all--HS was a huge waste of time, and that way, not only would all my core credits have been taken care of when I transferred to university, but I'd at least have an associate's degree to fall back on if/when I had to drop out of the BA/MA program, which is marginally better than the mere HS diploma and haphazard smattering of uni credits I have now.  

I also--though it's super controversial AFAIK--wish I would've actually been accelerated, skipped grades, which I easily could have (and ironically, had I attended the ""worse"" schools in the low-income inner city area my parents moved out of for exactly that reason when I was five and ready to start kindergarten, I would've), and which also would've helped with ""beating the clock"" and getting further ahead before my sanity evaporated and my mind turned to mush.

**TL;DR: I was intellectually/academically (especially verbally) ""gifted"" to a nearly prodigal degree from early on, my mom cared and tried to foster my abilities and education but couldn't do so adequately herself, and for various reasons I underachieved and my potential was stunted and eventually withered.  I was homeschooled/unschooled in elementary, tossed back into mainstream public school in fifth/sixth grade and had a bad time, went into a fantastic ""gifted and talented"" program in middle school I flourished in and had a great time, re-mainstreamed in HS which was a waste, took dual-credit university classes starting at 16, graduated HS a semester early, became passionate about literature and linguistics, was on track to get my BA and MA and everyone thought I'd become a prominent linguist/theorist specializing in cognitive semantics and metaphor theory someday, studies got sidelined/derailed temporarily due to personal circumstances, then at 20 I went insane and became permanently disabled by severe mental illness.  Dropped/failed out, lost everything, am now 26 with only a HS diploma and some creative writing (poetry and short fiction) published in obscure niche journals to show for it all, have never and possibly will never have a real job, on SSI, barely struggling through life on the far margins of society taking lots of drugs to cope enough to stay alive to actualize what remains of my literary/intellectual potential in whichever small way I can, the end.**"
AskReddit,fp8wu5a,t3_gbzzib,1588405776.0,"Ooh, my time to shine!  ;-P  Fair warning, this is a novel of a Reddit comment.  TL;DR at the end in bold.

So, I must preface this by saying that I *absolutely do not mean to sound arrogant*, but simply to clarify my situation, since as some people ITT have pointed out, ""gifted"" can have wildly different meanings and connotations: I was never ""gifted"" in the sense of being the teacher's-get, getting good grades and behaving perfectly; it was about raw intellectual potential that, sadly, was never fully realized and later derailed completely.

Verbal intelligence has always been my greatest area of aptitude and from a very early age I apparently held articulate-for-my-age chatty conversations with adults, learned to read before kindergarten (and actually helped teach another girl in preschool how to read, which is one of my most wholesome childhood memories), and was generally voraciously literary and language-oriented from the get-go.  In first grade, I blazed through all of the curriculum in a week and spent the rest of the year reading ""chapter books"" in the back of the classroom as they didn't know what else to do with me.  This combined with a concern on my mom's part regarding bullying in my town and an incident in which I was apparently ""bullied"" (I only recall it very vaguely and IIRC it was overblown, just teasing from a set of twins that wasn't terribly malicious or overly mean-spirited, but it was immediately post-Columbine, so...) led to me being removed from the public school system to be homeschooled (and effectively 'unschooled' much of the time--in the good way) by my mom for second through fourth grade under an arrangement/program through the district/county at the time in which they provided us with math and other curriculum and I attended ""specials""--art, music, PE classes--daily at the local elementary for peer socialization.

I enjoyed this greatly, but was suddenly dropped back into the public system (albeit at a ""better"", much more academically-oriented elementary school in a higher-income neighborhood in the area) for fifth grade, as my parents abruptly switched roles since my father, a horrifically abusive alcoholic and poly-drug addict who was gravely disabled by *severe* mental illness (bipolar I, GAD, and Cluster B personality disorders) found himself only intermittently employable after the dot-com bubble burst.  (In addition to having to reenter the workforce after a decade to support us, my mom also later confided in me that she felt I was quickly reaching/outpacing the limit of her ability to teach me properly.)  This didn't go well, as it was quite a shock for majorly introverted, quirky me to be suddenly dropped into an overwhelming social milieu, and to go from being able to pursue my own passionate interests and projects with a great deal of freedom to a regimented traditional-classroom structure, and I didn't adjust well--not to mention the abuse that suddenly became much more directly targeted at me with my dad as the stay-at-home parent.  In sixth grade I was relentlessly bullied and actually sexually harassed (was surrounded by rich kids with absentee parents who were literally watching hardcore porn at that age--surreal and bizarre given how sheltered I'd been) by a group of boys when my actual gender identity and expression (and sexual orientation) began to become manifest (I'm a lesbian trans woman).  But I digress.

In middle school I was able to enter a ""gifted and talented"" accleration-in-grade (we studied high-school level curriculum within this program that was sort of like a school within a school, but didn't officially/directly ""skip grades"") and enrichment program.  It was *wonderful*.  The teachers were exemplary educators and human beings, I was surrounded for the first time by my intellectual peers, and like myself, many if not most of the kids there were quirky and ""neurovariant"" in various ways, with either diagnosed or budding mental health and developmental conditions that were approached properly and compassionately, and I flourished.  I never actually took the battery of intelligence/aptitude tests that were necessary to enter the program as I entered midway through the seventh-grade year, but I flourished, especially in science (was devouring advanced biology and chem material at my own pace even faster than my peers in the program) and literature/""language arts"", in which I consistently scored the highest or among the highest in my class.  I developed genuine friendships for the first time, had a great relationship with the teachers, and was on a luminous track overall.  

Unfortunately, that didn't continue in high school, where I entered a ""pre-IB program"" for freshman and sophomore year that had none of the advantages of the middle school program and I found myself restless, disconnected, disinterested and slightly under-challenged again, and my grades went from all As and Bs to As and Cs and Ds.  (In one memorable incident, my government/civics teacher in 9th grade made a nice point about how grades didn't correlate with ability to the class using me as the example, staring right at me while saying ""for example, the smartest person in this class, currently has a D"", haha.)  I was suffering from undiagnosed DSPS/DSPD and had to get up at 5 am every day to commute to school on public transit, so those first few years were brutal--I constantly ""microslept"" throughout the day, and l remember very little of freshman year because of this.  I mastered the basic intro-to-organic chem material in sophomore year and really enjoyed it, and made a best friend through high school in a Chinese student who was an outcast due to cultural differences and a severe speech impediment (English was actually his third language, though he spoke Hebrew, Mandarin and English fluently), who happened to be a *seriously* gifted mathematician.  Prodigy-level--he was actually *doing original math* at that stage! 

Instead of continuing on to IB, which I had no interest in doing, I broke away once again from the mainstream system to start taking classes in linguistics and Japanese literature in translation from a state university for dual credit at 16.  My commuting logistics during those years were *crazy*--I'd have to get up and commute to HS in the morning, take public transit far across the state (a combination of local buses, regional buses and rail) to attend my college classes in the afternoon, and was taking Aikido classes multiple times a week 30-40 miles from *there* at night!  All on little sleep and no stimulant meds of any kind.  I exhibited early-onset cyclothymia then (which later developed into full-blown bipolar disorder, but that's coming, getting there...) and was extremely hypomanic most of the time, that's the only way I was possibly able to pull that off.

I graduated HS officially a semester early (could've been a year early had I taken HS coursework seriously and waited to do the dual-credit courses, but I didn't care about HS work that much) and became a full ""degree seeking"" university student--the first semester went well, was taking a full credit load and got all As and Bs.  I became passionate about the field of linguistics and a particular sub-sub-niche in cognitive linguistics/semantics under the tutelage of an amazing mentor, who recommended me for a five-year dual fast-track BA/MA program at 18.  I was even taking some graduate-level courses at that point.  But after that...everything pretty much disintegrated.  

At 18/19 I finally ""came out"" and actualized fully as myself, began ""medically transitioning"" (I'd been basically blackmailed out of doing so by my abuser since I was 11, but that's another story--point is, I had more on my mind than academics) and moved out (had to escape my home environment by any means possible) and tried (and failed miserably) to ""launch"" as an adult.  I immersed myself in the ""trans/queer/social justice"" (I know, I know--I'm not like that now, haven't been for years) scene, and my academics lagged as I, understandably, focused on becoming a full realized *person*, human being instead of the brain-in-a-jar shell persona I'd been up to that point.  

I'd been publishing poetry in various 'zines and journals off and on, and started focusing on writing short fiction in earnest.  I had a lot going on at ""home""/familial issues, a lot going on in myself, was existentially exploring the way most people do in their earlier teens, but delayed, and academics fell by the wayside a bit.  Remember how I said I was hypomanic?  Well, I'd taken credits haphazardly all over the place, a bunch of electives out of pure interest, and wasn't on a solid track for my major/degree as a result--I found myself having to go back and take a bunch of ""required core credit"" classes I couldn't give two whits about, so my interest lapsed there as well.  It was the perfect storm, and then...

...at 19/20, severe, disabling mental illness abruptly set in and hit me like a freight train, and I had a nervous breakdown I never truly recovered from.  By this point I was living with the woman I'd be briefly married to in a pricey condo rented on a small sum of inheritance money (long story there) and that intense and tempestuous relationship that I was in *no* way remotely ready for consumed my energy also away from school.  I just...dissolved.  Totally freaked out, as I had no idea what was happening to me.  Untreated/unmedicated bipolar II, GAD, PTSD, as well as all the severe symptoms of the three personality disorders I'd later be clinically diagnosed with (schizotypal, borderline, and avoidant) brought me to my knees.  
(cont. in self-reply below)"
BPD,fo66ba0,t3_g5t6v7,1587548139.0,"Honestly I'm rather skeptical that people with personality disorders--any PD--are truly capable of 'love'.  Oh, it varies, of course, from disorder to disorder and individual to individual, but PD pathology is such that I don't think what 'love' means to us aliens (pwPDs) encompasses the whole core of what it is to the earthlings (pw/oPDs).  The way I see it, at the crux of every PD, what all PDs have in common, is a void or at least significant deficit, nearly a total lack/hole, of some element that comprises the healthy human psycho-social-emotional makeup.  In pwBPD, what's lacking there is the ability to properly regulate/filter emotion and to some extent, self-esteem.  To be truly capable of 'love' of either exogenous (as opposed to familial--I definitely 'love' my mother, but that's not what I mean) sort OP's referring to, I suspect one needs to at least have all of those major elements of the psyche *present*--even if some don't always function optimally or properly (that's normal for most people).  pwPDs just pretty much lack one or more of those elements, ergo we aren't capable of that kind of 'love'.

Now, I'm not *wholly* convinced of the validity of this argument/hypothesis, but my experience with my own and others' (having been raised by, exposed to and voluntarily associated with other pwPDs most of my life), it feels at least plausible.

Speaking for myself, I don't know...I'm not totally comfortable saying I'm capable of 'love', I don't know that I am as a PDed person--but then again, I've got comorbidities (as in my flair).  When I really reach deep down and introspect on this, I can 'love' people for the intangible things they can give/provide me related to my pathology--I can 'love' the elaborate, imaginative internal worlds I can create with someone and love someone for/who's willing to engage in creating them with me (schizotypal), like children playing elaborate make-believe games; I've had intense feelings of infatuation that registered at the time as 'love' for people who could give me reparenting-type nurturance and validation and who fluffed up my diseased all-or-nothing ego so to speak (borderline); I 'love' people who make me feel ""certain of being liked"" by them and who rarely if ever voice disapproval, rejection or criticism directly or harshly (avoidant)--in other words, I've only 'loved' people or can 'love' people who can give me something that meshes with my three-PD psychopathology and the psychological needs it creates.  (I essentially never experience serious unreciprocated romantic or platonic attraction, something I've wondered about for years, and I suspect this is why--I *only* become interested in someone romantically and/or platonically once they've strongly signaled that they can/will provide some of those needs to fill those voids, holes in my psyche.)  

But truly *loving* someone for who *they* are as a person, irrespective of what they can or can't do for me in that psychological sense, supporting their whole sustained existence emotionally as a gestalt and wanting them to thrive and wanting to help contribute to that as much as I can?  Nope.  I'm pretty sure I'm simply not capable of that.  I sort of felt that once, years ago, for one individual--but the validity of that is highly dubious considering it was someone I spoke to only online, knew the backstory/life-history and saw photos of (never heard her voice, saw her on video, or in person), for a few months.  So I'm pretty certain my brain just isn't wired that way, isn't wired to 'love' in the ""normal""/""healthy"" sense.  

That's my take on and experience with it, anyway.  Take it FWIW.  I'm sure it'll be controversial because (as I've noticed, and used to be one myself) a lot of pwBPD like to pretend they're at least *capable* of everything ""normal and healthy"" psychoemotionally even if the disorder interferes.  I'm more cynical these days about that sort of stuff, and beginning to think I may have to ""radically accept"" that as someone with PDs my brain is simply defective such that certain major defining aspects of human experience are intrinsically inaccessible to me, and live accordingly."

That one was so anticlimactic and muddled toward the end it was bewildering and actually frustrated/angered me a little (as I find that case fascinating, so was invested).

I think this issue mainly arises from two conflicts true crime podcasters face: the tension between wanting to present themselves as ""only seeking/reporting/investigating/presenting the *truth!*"" and yet also suspenseful, compelling and ""standout"", and the tricky balance between conveying their own genuine viewpoints on they cases the cover and ""letting the listeners decide for themselves"".  As irksomely inchoate, noncommittal, and inconsistent as they can be sometimes from a listener's point of view, I have to say I don't envy podcasters those balancing acts they face.  It takes real talent to successfully walk those tightropes through an entire podcast, and when creators fall short or falter in one of those two main areas (IMO), that's when it tends to go awry into muddling-meandering-ambiguityville."
BPD,fo1wksq,t3_g533kd,1587443179.0,"As long as I'm not in a close interpersonal relationship of any kind apart from family, I'm fairly good at concealing it and have been a ""quiet borderline"" for the past few years, ever since I went on amphetamines (it was a pretty drastic transformation, the 'emotional blunting' effects were life-changing for me).  Alas, though, recently with the pandemic and much other extreme stress and uncertainty I've been suffering from, my mask has been slipping more than it has in years, and that in itself has been alarming.

Edit: As a petulant subtype IDK if I actually 'count' for this...in day-to-day life my BPD is well-concealed, sure, but in any type of close relationship in which I'm emotionally invested it's still ragingly, glaringly obvious.  Was even on amphetamines, in the last close friendship I attempted."

Schizotypal,fn60m5k,t1_fn5wy72,1586682779.0,"Well exercise should definitely help.  It's the combination of extreme physical lethargy and extreme appetite with antipsychotics that's a killer weight-gain-wise.

Schizotypal,fn5wl31,t3_fyyi9u,1586678459.0,"Pretty much all antipsychotics will do this.  It's perhaps the best-known side effect and all I could suggest, lame as it is, would be to exercise willpower.

Schizotypal,fn5w1kz,t3_fzlt59,1586677895.0,"Perhaps there's more of a correlation with positive symptoms?  I'm right-handed, but my positive symptoms aren't all that severe.  When they've been relatively ""severe"" (very early adulthood before I was medicated or treated at all, I was truly 'crazy' in a sense a layperson would recognize), they haven't been terribly 'bizarre' (more just extreme paranoia and anxiety about getting home-invaded, feeling presences, general sense of being recorded/watched everywhere).  My negative symptoms have always been much more prominent than the positive ones.

Sometimes I wonder in passing if there are at least two broadly distinct categories of schizotypals: those who are closer to schizophrenia on the spectrum with more prominent and bizarre ""positive"" symptoms who have social problems related to engagement (because the positive symptoms leak out indiscriminately), and those who tend more towards the schizoidy (minus the extreme apathy/lack of desire for human connection) and avoidant side, with more prominent negative symptoms, social deficits more centered around disengagement/isolation/alienation, cognitively hyper-metaphoric and abstract and having complex inner landscapes, but whose positive symptoms are generally more vague/generalized and mundane and related to slippage between metaphor and reality, perhaps mistaken by observers as more ""bizarre"" than they are because the metaphor-system isn't understood.  I'd place myself definitely in the latter category.  I suspect this influences suspected correlations with ""schizotypy"" as a whole."
honesttransgender,fmvugto,t3_fvqno3,1586431318.0,"I think they're just tacky and a garish, shallow trashy trend that took off with the social media age regardless, they're all about showing off on social media and I find it crass, vapid and tasteless for various reasons even without the implications you're mentioning.  It isn't really an ""old tradition"", it's a contemporary social media phenomenon as it currently exists, and a pointless and decadent one at that.  I had to laugh when I read ""old tradition""--how on earth could it be an ""old tradition"" when the technology to definitively determine a child's genitalia and/or karyotype prenatally didn't exist and become commonplace until relatively recently?  :-P

Even though we're a very small fraction of the population, still, it really isn't something I could ever be on board with enthusiastically given the implications for transsexual and intersex people.  Sure, you could argue that it's silly to take precautionary measures in the very inprobable case that the child will be trans or IS, but eh, gender reveal parties are dumb, frivolous and tasteless anyway, so foregoing those just in case--or for any reason, really--is hardly bending over backwards to make some grand accommodation or sacrifice.  And regardless of how we factor in, what doesn't quite sit right with me about those is that innumerable children around the world and throughout history (not only trans/intersex ones) are actually treated differently/worse because one or both of their parents were super-invested in them being the gender they didn't turn out to be.  Anything that celebrates or shows the parents' emotional investment in the gender of their expected child makes me wonder and calls that to mind.

You miss out somewhat on the many benefits of increased allopregnanolone that way, for one thing.  I'm a little rusty, it's been a long time since I learned about all of this but it's possible the other metabolites have something to do with effect on breast growth.  It absorbs really well orally if you take it with a high-fat meal every time.  

Also, progesterone's effect on breast growth is controversial as it is and not something experienced by all women who go on it for that primary purpose.  Don't get me wrong, I'm a staunch advocate of its importance in HRT regimens for a great many reasons and it's vastly better and healthier than AAs as an antiandrogen and general med to augment estradiol, but if you're really counting on breast growth with it, that's just something to be aware of.  

Anyway, yeah, I'd try switching to taking it orally with a high-fat meal daily for an extended period and see if there are any positive changes.  How much progesterone are you taking?"

When I posted this I never expected that there is an elder lady my mother's age from Ukraine, who began actualizing before I was even born, who compounds her own homebrew injectable E and sells it online.  The world can be an interesting place sometimes, that's for sure.  That's really nifty.

$60/vial is more like it, far more feasible with my budget.  My initial inclination would be to say that home-compounded E sounds dubious especially for an injectable formulation, but it sounds like she knows what she's doing and takes many precautionary measures to ensure its safety and sterility, from what's written on her webpage.  I still don't know if I'd feel *entirely* comfortable injecting that--I think I'd want to read some unbiased reviews first, but then again, for backup E I probably won't need to use for quite some time if ever, it's not a bad option.  Have you used hers with no issues, and it's effective?  Thanks for bringing my attention to this!  And assuming it's really safe, good on and godspeed to Miss Lena for doing this.  She sounds like a very interesting and neat lady overall, from her website.

I'll look further into it, something to consider.  The main impetus behind me wanting to order backup E is that my endo's office was ridiculously negligent at one point in 2018 and I ended up going three weeks without a shot (and I've always injected weekly). Apocalyptic scenarios (and there's been some paranoia I've halfway bought into circulating recently about insurance providers dropping coverage for HRT if/when it's completely depathologized) aside, they can be slow to fulfill refills and I don't always remember when I'm almost out or to call in the request well in advance.

In general in my true crime interests, I'm most captivated by cases that have the potential to advance understanding of human psychology by presenting psychopathology that transcends, defies or is insufficiently explained by contemporary (at the time of the case(s) in question) models, taxonomies and explanations of even the most aberrant/deviant/abnormal minds.  The Leopold & Loeb case, one of my favorite true crime stories/cases of all time, arguably fits into this category as well as the concept of a ""thrill-killing"", of murdering someone random just for the exhilaration and feeling of superiority engendered in the killer(s) by the act, was somewhat of a novel and thus frightening idea at the time.

Along similar lines, the Alpine Manor killings perpetrated by Gwendolyn Graham and Cathy Wood (recently paroled) is among the most interesting cases to me for sure.  I'm fascinated with dyads in general, personally, but this case is totally unique in many ways: female serial killers, female lust killers, dyad serial killers, and female-female criminal dyads are all comparatively very rare.  A female-female, lesbian, serial lust/thrill-driven killer dyad?  Unprecedented, otherwise unheard of.  Plus the psychological dynamics at play between the two and details of how the case came to light are similarly unique and incredibly fascinating."
honesttransgender,fl3mpwx,t3_fm4fly,1584791033.0,"What the ""trans/TERF war"", particularly the conflict between radfems and trans *women*, is, is/was inevitable given, and it reveals, the core essence of what ""trans"" fundamentally *is* that absolutely nobody (save myself, and it took me years to finally figure this out and it shook my whole worldview to the very core when I did) seems to want to see or admit.  

Since nearly the genesis of feminism--seriously, as depressing as this is, it goes back to the first wave and the suffragettes--the strategy, the rhetoric, the core premise has been to advocate for women's interests in a male/patriarchally-constructed-and-dominated society by downplaying, explaining away, and/or invalidating the essence of fundamental gender differences and where they come from.  This distilled down to framing gender as merely an arbitrary accident of birth manifested in something *purely physical*, pared down in its crudest form to a classification system based entirely on one's genitalia/reproductive system.  This was attractive to feminists who sought equality with men or an improved situation for women in general, because the more arbitrary and unimportant, un*essential* you can make the distinction seem (just as in the Civil Rights/racial equality movement, the popular narrative of which was just ""race is simply skin color/pigmentation...and isn't that an absurd basis upon which to build a hierarchy?), the more absurd, evil, unfounded and unnecessary the hierarchy based on the difference in question appears.  So that became the prevailing narrative of feminism, and all the nuances of apparent gender differences in psychology, behavior, inclination, personality traits and tendencies and how they manifest in lived reality, etc., etc. were framed as merely and entirely products of this subjugation hierarchy of oppression that was imposed upon women, as well as causes of perpetuating it, things that aren't really real or essential/fundamental to what it means to be a woman but rather things that are told about, to, and ""socialized into"" women from birth to keep them in a subservient role/place in society.

But then, along come (visibility and consciously-wise) trans women and men.  This is already a very simplified summary but I'll just focus on trans women for the purposes of developing this point (as the TERF conflict with trans men is basically just a byproduct, they're just framed as shortsighted/misguided female ""traitors"" who grasp at joining the patriarchy rather than dismantling it, in TERFland).  We/they fly in the face of this narrative by our very existence, and are thus *extremely* inconvenient for feminism and feminists.  If people who are male-assigned-at-birth express feeling an extremely powerful (powerful enough to drive us/them to risk family, income, life and limb, undergo invasive surgeries in many cases, to suicide if obstructed/thwarted, etc., etc.) ""internal/subjective"" sense of ""being/feeling like female/women"", and feel vastly more comfortable being perceived and treated as such, and our experiences/""identity""/etc. are taken at face-value, then...gender *can't be defined purely by genitalia*.  It *can't be arbitrary*.  It *can't be socialized*.  It must have some real, essential basis.  This threatens the whole edifice of feminism and the ground on which it historically stands.  So we have to be explained away, invalidated, and so we are.  We're just creepy male fetishists trying to ""possess""/""rape"" the female body as much as possible (if we're gynephilic).  We're just self-hating gay men with internalized homophobia (if we're exclusively androphilic).  We're male invader spies who want to have our cake and eat it too (reap the benefits of patriarchy on both ends, from both gender perspectives) and/or undermine ""female spaces"" and what feminist women have tried to build by inserting ourselves into them and diluting what they stand for.  And so on and so forth.  These scrambling, mind-bogglingly absurd, convoluted and fanatically hostile ""explanations"" that purport to account for trans female existence preserve the crux of what feminism has all along been rooted in: gender (difference) isn't *real*, it's arbitrary, it's just made-up BS instilled in everyone's worldview to construct a hierarchy with people born with penises exerting power over people born with vaginas.  

So *of course* the more ""radical"" the feminists, the more of an inherent conflict exists and the more of a problem they are likely to have with trans women (and trans men by extension).  Had feminism been based on the premise of ""okay, gender differences are real/essential and brain-based/not-purely-physical but also personality/psychological, ultimately endocrine (or rather, in the first-wave era, something like ""women and men are made divinely with different natures that transcend the physical"") but that doesn't make us *inferior* or *subservient*"" from the onset or at least much earlier on, this all wouldn't be an issue and the whole TERF nonsense as we know it never would have existed as trans people never would have posed that 'threat'/inconvenience to feminist dogma that feminist premises couldn't explain.  

You should look more deeply into the early history of TERFism.  Read about Sandy Stone and the Olympia Records controversy, and read Beth Elliott's memoir/writings.  As I understand it, TERFism wasn't the immediate and default or majority reaction of feminism to the visibility of trans people by any means.  When trans women, particularly *lesbian* trans women, began to emerge en masse as visible and self-actualize (as the medical technology newly existed to do so) in the 1970s, and when we landed on their radar (by being active politically in lesbian/feminist movements and 'spaces', activism), rigid radfems quickly scrambled to cobble together a bunch of disingenuous, often outright ""retconning/rewriting of history"" (in various ways, from personal biographies to ideological history and beyond) nasty BS that survived by perennially mutating like a virus from that point onward, eventually into the TERFism we all know and loathe today.

It's not a ""false flag"" and it's not an unnecessary or ""divisive"" conflict that is distracting from ""the main goal against those who are 'hurting us all'"".  It is an essential, fundamental, totally inevitable conflict, the roots of which go all the way down into the very core of what any of this *means* or is about.  Rigidly traditionalist unabashedly pro-patriarchal conservatives aren't the sole enemy of trans people--they're one facet of the opposition, but not *the main* or *only* 'enemy' in terms of a threat to our rights/dignity/valid existence.  I even argue that they're less of our enemy than radfems/TERFs are, because at least they acknowledge the reality of essential sex/gender differences, which is fundamental to what it means to be ""trans"".  What you're seeing with the grotesque and unspeakably repugnant extreme expressions in the ""trans/TERF war"" are not some ""right wing"" pro-patriarchalist conspiracy, but simply this inevitable conflict that has festered and chafed for decades coming to more and more of a head, floridly bursting into extreme vitriol, as both the ""trans visibility"" movement and ""gender abolitionist"" radfem/TERF (which is, fundamentally, just feminist, the endpoint of feminism) movement have gained more mainstream visibility/coverage/footholds in public consciousness/discourse and are thus making that ""push to the finish line"" more obnoxiously, blatantly and aggressively than ever."
Transmedical,fl3jv0l,t3_fm69nr,1584787383.0,"Sure, as it's a medical condition I'm all for distancing it from the ""LGBT"" alphabet-soup umbrella mess, but this seems johnny-come-lately and rather moot to me at this point, and it's hardly the first time that has been proposed.  Not to sound extremely negative right off the bat or like a ""devil's advocate"", but...without reading this whole ""manifesto"", is this one of those breakaway pushes (like 'TS separatism' and its ilk years back) that throws non-heterosexual transsexuals under the bus or casts us as less validly transsexual?  

The thing is, and while I don't agree with this as an argument for including it under the ""LGBT"" cluster per se by any means (though I'm sure it's used as such, as that justification), most of us, statistically...aren't straight, at least as far as trans women are concerned (I admittedly know less about transsexual men, care less about trans men, personally, and think assessing the demography/distribution of sexual orientation in them is likely to be significantly trickier for several reasons I won't get into).  Most of us are gynephilic, so from a ""transmedicalist"" standpoint, it seems that whatever the prenatal/genetic/developmental factors behind transsexuality are are linked to those behind homosexuality/gynephilia in women (female brains).

If it's more of a political rejection of ""LGBT"" culture and ""identity"" on a more general level, then sure, I'm on board with that by default, but...it's inadequately limited and moot, just one little piece of the bigger picture which we really need to be addressing (especially at this stage, where things have degenerated so far...), so that's pretty pointless, to be blunt.  (I guess I will be negative here.)  It just frustrates me that everything I'm seeing nowadays from the ""transmedicalist"" and overall ""sane trans"" side is so belated, fragmented and myopic.  There's a larger picture here, that unless we address it will render all such efforts totally futile.  Addressing that bigger picture begins with framing this as a medical condition--and *not* one defined by ""dysphoria"", but a neurodevelopmental one prenatally that is functionally an endocrine one post-natally and post-pubescently, and aligning it more with the (traditional) intersex movement than anything gender/binary-transgressive.  I'd like to see an ""intersex and transsexual"" umbrella that uses the strategies, approaches and paradigms traditionally advocated/promulgated by the intersex rights movement.  Until that happens, stuff like this is quaint/cute and has its heart in the right place but misses the point.  Sorry.

On the more encouraging end, I've been intending to write a proper, fleshed-out ""manifesto"" for my vision for years now, just haven't gotten around to it yet, and I encourage writing manifestos and pushing back against the prevailing nonsense in whichever ways one can, so good on this for that, but I just don't see this as targeting the crux of the problem."

I dunno...for one thing Lanza strikes me as one of those contrarian types who just had extremely high...what's it called, that metric on some ""dark traits"" questionnaires that have circulated...unconventional morality?  Moral disengagement, I think that's it--yeah, that--and who took a twisted delight in challenging the moral and ethical linchpins of the sociocultural fabric he felt so alien in.  As an alien myself with high levels of ""moral disengagement"" by default as a result of personality disorders, I used to be similar when I was a teenager (though not to this degree, certainly, holy hell, yikes), and fortunately outgrew it in many ways, at least the obnoxiously ""contrarian"" tendencies and hyperintellectualized deconstruction of conventional mores.

Given his extreme 'neuroatypicality' and obvious severe mental illness (autism spectrum, obsessive-compulsive disorder, possibly schizo- spectrum as well but definitely the former two, especially OCD), I don't think the concept of sexuality and sexual deviation can easily be applied in any conventional sense to him from what little we know of his makeup.  It's quite possible that he exhibited the ""O""--obsessive, intrusive thoughts, etc.--internal component of OCD in addition to the outward compulsions and aversions he shaped his entire life around, and that often tends to center on things like pedophilia.  IDK.  The ""Smiggles"" forum posts and banter with other users showed a lot of ambivalence and layers of murkiness around his approach to sexuality as a whole.

TrueCrime,fj3cb97,t3_fb08z7,1582978186.0,"* The Columbine shooters certainly didn't ""cite"" Kinkel's attack as any sort of ""blueprint"" for theirs, whatsoever.  On the contrary, they had great dismissive disdain for prior school shooters earlier in the 90s, who in their perception (and honestly, I can't say I find it an unreasonable one) went off half-cocked and approached mass killing very differently, which segues into,

* The Columbine duo were effectively terrorists, who approached mass killing in an extremely different and vastly more ambitious and methodical manner to nearly every ""school shooter"" who preceded them.  Columbine was originally, primarily intended to be a bombing that would wipe the entire school off the map, and just about everything Harris and Klebold did was geared towards attaining media attention and perennial infamy, which they thoroughly succeeded in, even though their logistical plans fell majorly through and far short of their intentions.  Their vision was much larger-scale, their methods and planning were far more sophisticated--albeit not nearly as 'sophisticated' as they themselves believed in their grandiosity--and well-honed compared to the handful of traumatized and literally psychotic ""school shooter"" kids who came before.  This assured their place in history and continued prominence in popular culture and the media.  They weren't traumatized or psychotic; they had personality disorders, that was their main psychopathological deal behind the motivation for the attack, and the implications of that were pretty much theretofore unprecedented/unseen/unknown in 1999.  I honestly am not certain as to whether Kinkel was genuinely psychotic at the time or not, but I have also written elsewhere about how I've noticed that floridly psychotic shooters tend to get less media coverage and fade from public consciousness quickly for various reasons, compared to shooters/mass killers who aren't.

Transsexuality is a condition you either have or you don't, and if you have it, you either have known it or at least had some significant inkling, or will (have to) figure it out on your own.  Yes, a lot of people misunderstand/misintrepret, repress and/or deny the reality of it to themselves because of societal factors, but the overarching idea that it's this nascent, dormant thing people are commonly totally unconscious of in themselves and either need others to help them recognize or will just spontaneously realize some ""random"" day with exposure to the right stimulus is so dubious and silly in so many ways and leads to a paradigm/environment in which people who don't really have this condition are encouraged to think and act as if they do or might(which nothing good will ever come out of).

Even if they internally conceptualize it to themselves as ""*sigh*, I wish I was female/male/a girl/boy/woman/man"", I'd venture a confident guess that most actually transsexual people have some cognizance of what their deal is from early on and before some sudden epiphany moment in adolescence/adulthood--at least, much more crystallized and less oblique awareness/cognizance of it than this ""egg"" nonsense implies and is based on.  It trivializes the condition and ""cute-ifies"" it in a puerile glib way, takes dubious generalizations for granted, casts an absurdly (and self-defeatingly, because it's so ripe for mockery by those hostile to transsexuals overall for whatever reasons) wide net that assumes a rare condition is commonplace and could suddenly manifest in nearly anyone (gee, *that's* not going to encourage fear-mongering and public frustration over it at *all* /s), and irresponsibly encourages people to conclude they have it as part of pushing a social agenda.  I want to make an omelette from that entire concept/meme/whatever, throw it down the garbage disposal and switch it on.

More broadly/generally, I find myself increasingly skeptical and taking issue these days with the notion of ambiguity in whether one is transsexual or not, to the point where if someone's seriously ""questioning"" for very long, ""doesn't know"" (i.e., in the insipid terms of the egg metaphor, their ""egg hasn't cracked yet!"") at *all* until well into adulthood, or is vacillating back and forth uncertainly, I just default to assuming they don't have this condition, that they're not.  That may be a bit rigid, harsh and hastily-dismissive but that's the point we're at now--many people go through ""questioning"" because they *don't wish to be*/*hope they're not* transsexual, which is completely understandable for such a stigmatized condition, but that's not really ""questioning"", it's false/only apparent.  Actual, genuine and extensive questioning of one's trans status is IMO a red flag for not having this condition and just being swayed into thinking one might by one's social/subcultural milieu.  I really don't get how somebody could not know at all until the right conditions/people/stimuli/circumstances suddenly provoke a ""eureka I'm trans!"" moment.  That just reeks of the whole ""gender doesn't really matter and is all wibbly-wobbly contextual-subjective!"" BS that is the guiding hallmark behind all the issues with the ""trans community"" narratives/agenda/worldview currently and overwhelmingly for the last ~10 years.  No.  Sex/gender matters, is something that encompasses so much of the self and self-image, and is something human beings are innately aware of and consciously think about enough that if your actual sex/gender is not the one you were assigned at birth, you're going to have some pretty strong idea--even if you push/explain it away and don't act on it--that that's the case long before something makes your ""egg crack"" (*cringe*) in whatever stage of adulthood.

*Especially* in the contemporary world with the availability/omnipresence of the internet, visibility of all forms of difference/deviance/defects and whatnot--I mean, come on now.  You'd have to be especially dense, especially in denial, and especially out of touch with yourself and incurious not to piece it together pretty early on nowadays if you're really transsexual.  This might sound ""elitist"", ""retconned""/exaggerated/insincere or whatever, and I do know that not everybody is consciously aware from early childhood, but I was in elementary school when I realized something was off, and then was consequently searching around and asking questions and saving the Wikipedia article on 'Transsexual' on my dad's computer and googling ""can you be a girl/woman with a penis"" (which brought up...obvious things that kinda traumatized me, but that's another story) and so forth.  So subsequently, when I was getting ready to actualize and seek treatment when I hit legal adulthood and was emerging from the mask (which was more to the outside world than myself, and more imposed by circumstance than self-imposed), the ""questioning"" period was brief and perfunctory indeed.  I wasn't an ""egg"" that ""needed to crack"" to myself pretty much ever, and that might be extreme but I doubt it's that far off from the experience of most genuinely transsexual people.  That egg business is just a primrose path for all kinds of trender-ism."

A lot of all of this could be improved, if not mostly resolved, if Reddit or anything similar shared the aspect forums had of ordering threads on front pages by the ones most recently commented/posted *in* rather than simply the OPs/threads themselves most recently posted period.  Even if the option to order topics/OPs/threads this way was merely *available* but not default, for individual subs to be set or turned on/off at the mods' discretion, that would be a *substantial* improvement.  Reddit may have been originally/theoretically designed to be a meta-comment section and news/article feed of sorts, but what it turned into in practice is vastly broader than that in scope and obsoleted forums, and since that's the case it should really have that sorting option, which was at the heart of the advantages forums had."

Bundy's, Gacy's and Holmes' cursive ""you"" samples simply look like the well-practiced cursive writing of decently educated men (men because they're not 'flowery' or loopy as women tend to write old styles of cursive, and 'decently educated' only in the sense that the samples appear to be from people who would've had a fair amount of opportunity and frequent occasion to write in cursive), which Tsarnaev's ""you"", Harris' cursive ""you"", and Berkowitz's ""you"" all look like more tentative, less-practiced/automatic and more belabored, more sophomoric/juvenile versions of.

TrueCrime,fi001gy,t3_f5221q,1582019950.0,"In short, no, because sociopathy/psychopathy (what is formally, clinically known as ASPD), and the personality disorder psychopathologies in general that fuel SKs in nearly all cases, simply don't work the way they've been portrayed in fictional media.  

I've said this before in other contexts, but as someone avidly interested in abnormal (and forensic) psychology, as a true crime aficionada, and as someone with severe personality disorders herself (though not ASPD or NPD), the way Dexter-like shows depict the psychological makeup and motivations of their deviant antihero characters and what it conveys about criminal psychology makes me roll my eyes more often than not.  Portrayals like *Dexter* propagate an understanding/idea of pathologies that usually apply to violent criminals, especially extreme fringe cases like SKs, in a way that is inaccurate at best and dangerous at worst, because the massive suspension of disbelief and departure from the realities of human psychology they require aren't obvious as such to anyone without knowledge in the abnormal psych/PD/true crime fields.

The implications generalize to much more beyond serial killers, but since that's what this thread is specifically about: there's no such thing as a ""benevolent"" SK (or mass murderer, or spree killer, or whatever have you) who would be identifiable and categorizable as such to the general/mainstream public, because essentially, almost anyone/everyone capable of such actions in the first place isn't internally subject to or driven by the same moral and ethical compass/system, psychoemotional responses and motivations, or set of schemata that comprise the view of and approach to the world that most people without the psychopathological issues necessary to commit acts like serial murder share.  Sociopaths/psychopaths are out for purely themselves, but what that actually means and looks like in reality is much more all-encompassing and deep-seated than it often does in fiction.

Being ""benevolently"" motivated would entail basing one's motivations upon other people's moral and ethical standards, which sociopaths/psychopaths (and, I'd argue, PDed people in general, but focusing on ASPD/sociopathy here...) by the very nature of their condition simply *don't do*, beyond what's absolutely necessary for self-preservation and self-advancement.  People on that spectrum, *especially* those on the extreme enough end where one would have to be to be a serial killer, by and large simply don't see the world in very moral/ethical terms beyond ""if it's good for me, brings me satisfaction, it's right"", and beyond that, aren't emotionally motivated in the same ways others are.  

Doing something like, say, limiting one's murder victims to child rapists or other serial killers or whatever other lowest-of-the-low demographic universally recognized as ""bad"" would require a.) having that same ethical/moral disapproval of other ""worse"" predators in the first place, in a way that goes beyond merely competitive contempt, b.) being emotionally motivated/driven enough at a high/abstract level to act on it consistently (i.e., by ""hatred"" of the ""bad"" demographic in question, because of moral/ethical disapproval), and c.) getting enough stimulation, enough of a visceral thrill out of it to keep doing it, planning and executing it and thus putting oneself at risk.  Among other things.  None of those are compatible with severe ASPD/sociopathic pathology: seeing the world in terms of ""right and wrong"" beyond oneself and one's own interests and wellbeing, being motivated by abstract emotions in that way for one's behavior to be so heavily based upon them--or even experiencing them much in the first place!--and not getting bored in pursuit of some ""greater good"" (or, again, even caring about or understanding ""greater good"" in the first place) are all elements of the psyche that are extremely deficient/underdeveloped/limited in people with ASPD.

People on the ASPD spectrum are highly motivated, moreso than non-sociopaths, by novelty-seeking and stimulation.  Where would that thrill/stimulation come from?  The idea of acting ""morally/ethically"", by some higher moral code, the idea of doing something ""good"" for society/other people, or of getting emotional satisfaction out of eliminating people who don't pose any direct/immediate threat to oneself that one ""hates"".  The first two there are anathema to ASPD/sociopathy--the only reason someone with severe ASPD would put themselves at risk to do something generally seen as ""good""/benevolent would be to reap personal benefits from being recognized/lauded for it (like social cache that can be exploited), and obviously in a serial-killer type of situation, that recognition and resultant benefits to the killer wouldn't be possible without getting caught.  The third one wouldn't be sufficient motivation for a sociopath either, because in people with ASPD such emotions are restricted to begin with and based more upon their own visceral urges and needs than any abstract sense of morals/ethics.  When sociopaths ""hate"" people that way, it's because they're perceived as obstructing in some way the sociopath's ability to fulfill their own individual/personal needs and desires, not because they're just seen as ""bad"" because of what they do to other people--who sociopaths see as merely means to that end (achieving the sociopath's goals/needs/desires) anyway.

A more succinct way of summarizing the flaw in shows/characters like Dexter from this standpoint and why they're unrealistic is that they portray their ""benevolent sociopaths/psychopaths"" as being subject to the same general *ethos* the rest of the non-sociopathic world is but just exempt from its *taboos* and *inhibitions*, freeing them to do things that other people might wish to do to ""bad"" people but can't/wouldn't.  In real life, it doesn't work that way because sociopaths/psychopaths--people with (esp. severe) ASPD--aren't subject to/behaviorally motivated by either/any of that; that is to say, people with a psychopathological makeup that makes them feel ""exempt"" from typical taboos/inhibitions like those against (serial) murder are *also* ""exempt"" from typical morals/ethics (like those that condemn predators of the ""weak"" or ""innocent"").  It all goes together.

**TL;DR: No, and characters like Dexter who are essentially sociopathic/psychopathic but ""benevolent"" in how they wield their psychopathology don't/can't exist in reality, are inherently paradoxical because the extreme disregard for/apathy towards other people's rights and needs that, say, being a serial killer (of any victim demographics, including universally maligned ones) would require stems from the whole of someone's psyche/personality--such as from a severe personality disorder like ASPD--and thus can't be selectively applied based upon some moral code, as morality/ethics is inherently/by definition about other people's rights and needs, which sociopathic people aren't terribly concerned with in the first place.  It's reasonable to assume someone would need to be on the ASPD spectrum to be a deliberate ""hunter"" type of serial killer, and people on said spectrum see the world in fairly simplistic predator/prey terms of risk/benefit to themselves when it comes to non-impulsive/planned behavior, and ""benefit to themselves"" doesn't include moral righteousness.  Intentionally being a serial killer of ""bad people"" would put the killer at more risk than benefit, as the only way that ratio could be skewed oppositely would be if the ""benefit"" to themselves lies in the sense of benefiting others or satisfaction in acting on emotion.  Sociopaths aren't self-sacrificing and when they act purely on emotion it's impulsive, not planned.**"

> Never heard of anything like what you describe and can't even find a grain of a plausible explanation in what medical understanding I have. 

But there is a perfectly plausible explanation, which I explained *in the post* (which apparently nobody commenting actually read)--tobacco in any form increases cortisol levels, and higher cortisol leads to this phenomenon with belly fat.  This happens to people who drink regularly, especially who are exposed more constantly to lower-dose varieties of alcohol (e.g., beer, hence ""beer gut"")--and alcohol, or rather some metabolite thereof (probably acetaldehyde, which is also present in cigarette and cannabis smoke, but don't quote me on that), also increases cortisol.  I'm pretty sure this is the same thing.  Probably a combination of higher cortisol and the nicotine messing with my endocrine system.  It's upsetting people on this sub because nasal snuff users IME usually don't want to have their vice of choice compared to other forms of tobacco and/or alcohol and feel smugly superior to people who mainly use those other products.

> If I where you I'd ask my physician and stop taking snuff if you feel that it affects your body in a way you don't like - it's tobacco, it will only be good for you to stop using.

I know.  I was just offhandedly wondering if perhaps there *was* some way to counteract this that other snuff users have found (apparently not, though who knows as nobody else here wants to even acknowledge that this comes with the territory).  I should quit both/all forms of tobacco and return to just using nicotine lozenges.

> It's then difficult to know what to make of someone who wants to declare an incomplete transition complete, and claim absolutely equal female status with cis and trans women who are physically female, whilst deliberately choosing some sort of futanari existence, to put it provocatively. If you choose a middle way, and then get treated as a middle/third gender in some respects, I'm not sure there is much room to protest.

Again, I vehemently challenge the notion that genital surgery (which amounts, again, to merely shuffling skin and nerves around to create something cobbled together that *resembles* different organs/tissue) determines whether a transition is ""complete"" or whether one is ""physically female"".  The argument you're making is the same argument TERFs make at base that one can never be ""physically female"" with a Y chromosome in one's karyotype and without a uterus and ovaries--the superficial details of where you draw the line are just different but the essence of the argument/approach is the exact same.

""Futanari"" is a dehumanizing, degrading sexualized slur (comparing my body--which I had no choice in when I was born--to a form of fictional animated fetish pornography?  Really?!) that, to be blunt, crosses the line of civility.  You're just trying to be incendiary and dismissive ad hominem, there, which is the domain of bullies and the obnoxiously bigoted (bigotry being defined here as excluding, dismissing and disdaining someone for superficial characteristics in the hand they were dealt by circumstance).  I take great offense to that.  There's no reason or justification to resort to sexually-charged snarl-words to make your point, and to be really frank, doing so is a common tactic of domineering men and masculinish women who act like them.

But what really gets me about this whole line of reasoning is that you're framing my inaction, decision not to get elaborate, invasive and expensive  surgery, as ""deliberately choosing"" and ""choosing a middle way"".  That's beyond specious and unfair, mental gymnastics indeed.  I *didn't* choose this anatomy.  I was born with it--it's just how I emerged into the world.  A defect, yes.  But not something I'm ""choosing"" in the slightest.  Corrective Lasic eye surgery exists, but if someone hasn't had it and doesn't intend to, that doesn't mean they're ""deliberately choosing"" to have poor eyesight.  My goodness...yikes.  That's such an imperious, arrogant and dangerous framing that puts the onus on people with congenital defects to correct them to be considered ""normal"" or fully human.  It's not like I'm doing anything to make my penis continue to exist and if I didn't it would cease to.  *That* would be ""deliberately choosing"" to have it.

'Kay.  Fine, good for you, that's your prerogative.  But our dignity, our ability to be accepted and categorized as full and complete members of our actual sex/gender (determined *by the brain* and how *it* developed in utero) should absolutely *not* be contingent upon the state of cutting-edge medical technology.  And the fact remains that you *don't* have a normal vaginal lining  that functions as such that you think stem cells could create, so.

I just do every woman the courtesy of assuming she has a normal body until I have some relevant reason to think otherwise.

Of course--that's just human decency, sanity, civil--no argument there.  The point of contention here is that you think not actively seeking out advanced medical/surgical intervention to alter the appearance of one's genitals one was born with--the same ones you were born with--is sufficient ""relevant reason to think otherwise"".  This whole paragraph insinuates that genitalia don't matter in how you sex/gender a person, but with your attitude that they have to be internal rather than external, a cavity, whether surgically-constructed or not, to be ""female"", contradicts that.

That's so beyond the pale I don't quite know how to respond, honestly--stupefying.  If you look down on me, you look down on me--fine, there are a lot of people I look down on unabashedly, and I don't really care what some random lady on the internet feels about me and how I approach my medical condition.  But don't be so incredibly disingenuous, patronizing and shifty about it or tell me I'm seeing things that aren't there.

Great.  Well, I can confidently say that you're unequivocally *not* ""my kind of person"" in the slightest, anything but ""thoughtful and articulate""--more like supercilious and disingenuous--and I would have no desire whatsoever to socialize with you, with someone who doesn't accept my actual sex/gender (which is determined *by the brain*, not the lump of tissue between the legs that didn't develop properly because of a *medical condition*), and evokes the most hurtful and pointedly inflammatory rhetoric to make that known.  I didn't bluntly ever say what I've said above about ""neovaginas"" because I intuited, I *know* that would be unnecessarily hurtful to post-op and pre-op women, but you forced my hand there, I had to fight fire with fire to defend myself from your noxious insinuations that I'm an ""entitled male interloper"" and don't have a right to be ""treated as female"" as someone with a female brain, female secondary sex characteristics and who has lived legally and socially as female as soon as I was an adult and thus able to do so.  But you don't mind going for the jugular to make abstract points about gender/sex that are, by your own admission, pretty arcane and irrelevant in the grand scheme of things in practical quotidian reality.  You know, there's a vulgar slang term for that, one that refers to an organ that every human being possesses regardless of sex/gender.

 > The current state of medical transition gets us to a point where we transsexual women, if we go far enough and aren't cursed with too much masculinisation from transitioning too late, are to all intents and purposes in the same shoes as any woman who's had a hysterectomy. I'm now at the point where menopause would be creeping up on me anyway. So, I see no excuse for discriminating against us on any score.

Okay, I hate to break it to you but--and here's *my* ""harshest possible version of my musings on"" *post-op* transsexuals--a neovagina doesn't make you ""physically female"", and certainly isn't the end-all-be-all determining factor in when transition is ""complete"".  What SRS/""GCS""/transsexual vaginoplasty creates is for all intents and purposes cosmetic and functionally a vagina only insofar as it's a cavity that can be penetrated.  It isn't a vagina in the same ways with all the same anatomical functions and aspects as a cis vagina--rearranging some skin and nerves from your penis and scrotum or part of your colon (depending upon the technique used) does not a ""normal"" vagina make.  It doesn't lead to a cervix, a uterus, isn't connected to ovaries that influence its function endocrinologically, and is reproductively useless.  It isn't the same tissue and even with the most advanced techniques currently available, it doesn't respond in the same ways or interact with the rest of the body in the ways that actual/natal/cis vaginas do.  

I've always had a ""to each their own, it's good enough to be considered as such"" attitude toward post-op genitalia, but the reality is that it merely resembles the internal and external sex organs that due to this condition (transsexuality) didn't develop in utero, and this attitude that gender/sex is determined or ""affirmed"" by surgically, artificially manipulating genital tissue to mimic certain sex organs is just bizarre to me.  The tissue you had at birth is still there, it's just been sliced-and-diced and reconfigured around to look and sort of act like something else.  One can compress, fold, lacquer and decorate paper to look like metal/metallic and have similar rigidity, but it's still paper, not metal.  A more apt analogy would be that you can make construction paper look and feel like cardboard, but it isn't cardboard, that's not how it was manufactured originally.

> It's just not like that if you have a penis.

Why?  Why not?  You can't/don't menstruate with a neovagina, again, the whole reproductive purpose and essence of what a vagina just isn't there, so how are you more ""in the same shoes as a woman who's had a hysterectomy"" than I am?  The experience of a reproductive and more importantly endocrine organ lost and the bodily, psychological/self-image and societal/social consequences of that in a society that defines gender and female value largely by reproductive capability (whether it's ever used or not) aren't something post-op trans women experience any more than non-op women do.  That's a disingenuous argument.

Before you compare it to HRT and secondary sex characteristics, that's different because that tissue is the same not only appearance-wise but functionally in every respect once it's been exposed to, governed by estrogen.  Breasts, skin and buttocks are the same as cis female breasts, skin and buttocks if/once exposed to estrogen for long enough.  What determines the functionality, appearance and *essence* of those organs is purely endocrine.  Not so with genitals.  Neovaginas are something different altogether, artificial. If I could push a button and have a fully-formed and normally-functioning female reproductive tract/system with all the requisite parts, I would.  If HRT somehow created that, I'd still go through HRT, happily.  In non-hypothetical reality, if someone decides/chooses not to go on HRT at all, then yeah, that brings their gender into question, because a.) sex hormones affect the *brain* and thus personality/characteristics and traits of how someone moves through the world and *acts*, and b.) HRT generates/morphs secondary sex characteristics that are virtually indistinguishable, not only on the surface but all the way through, from those in people who were born without the mismatched-genitalia difference/defect/condition, so there's no reason not to be treated with it.

>  I was functionally/de facto intersex or non-binary in terms of my physicality and I didn't believe that I could just override that reality by my sheer act of self-identification.

Sure, alright, as I said I have no issue with being ""de facto/functionally intersex"", but you're not any less so with your artificially-constructed neovagina than I am with the penis I was born with, no matter how many mental gymnastics you do to declare otherwise (which are the same thing, just ""self-identification"".  Some Frankenstein-esque surgeon could probably, in theory, make a foot look like a hand, but it isn't a hand and if I had that and declared it to be the same as a hand, that would just be ""self-identification"".

The way you blithely conflate intersex with ""non-binary"" is extremely misguided, ignorant/misinformed and dare I say highly problematic, exactly what intersex people have fought against for decades.  It *isn't* a matter of merely ""self-identification"" if you believe in the brain-sex theory of transsexual etiology at all.  I'm not female/a woman simply because I say so; I'm a woman because my brain is sexed/gendered female regardless of what genitals I was born with.  This line of thinking you promulgate is self-contradictory and self-aggrandizing.

> I never used my gym's locker rooms until I didn't have a penis, for example.

> I don't even identify as feminist, let alone TERF, but I was always mindful of the existence of safe female spaces and reluctant to ever behave with the entitled attitude of a male interloper. I sought to proceed with a certain humility, and pay my dues. I still haven't paid all my dues; e.g. I don't quite want to weigh in on discussions about the experience of being harassed and sexualised as a female-bodied pubescent.

This mentality overwhelmingly indicates that you don't really see yourself as a woman in the way that any other woman (without this transsexual condition) is, which is further indicated by how you've said elsewhere that you wished you could have simply been a cissexual *man*.  Fine, that's your business, but that's not how I see things or myself, my worldview, at all, and that plays right into the trans-denialist bigots who no matter what we do will always see us as not *really* women but merely imitators/impostors who might ""pass"" as such.  The brain is what determines sex/gender, as it determines all higher/sentient aspects of human condition and personality.  If your brain tells you you're a woman, you're a woman, and this is the case equally regardless of whether you were born with normal female genital anatomy or not.  

Being male in some fashion is what would render one ineligible for entering (ethically/teleologically/etc.) sex-segregated spaces such as locker rooms and the like.  I have a penis I didn't have any say in being born with, and that doesn't make me male at all because my *brain* is female, and my secondary sex characteristics reflect that.  If I were XX but born without a vagina and streak gonads due to some intersex condition, or my external genitals were horribly disfigured due to some developmental defect, I wouldn't be less validly eligible to use women's locker rooms.  Having this condition--transsexuality--where my genitalia are physically those typical of the opposite sex is not any different.  The problem with men in women's locker rooms etc. is that they have male *brains* and male outer attitudes/presentations to the world, which would make women (myself very much included) feel uncomfortable being undressed and vulnerable in that way around as a stranger.  We don't have male brains.  We are not men.  Surgically rearranging the tissue between your legs doesn't magically make you ""safe"" or female-brained or not-male.

The whole ""pay your dues"" thing is ridiculously self-hating and self-marginalizing/Othering and frankly sad and absurd.  Womanhood, sex/gender in general, isn't some exclusive club where you have to ""pay your dues"" or jump through X amount of particular hoops to get in.  That's just nonsense that reeks of the feminist (TERF in its most extreme form) worldview that frames womanhood in a schema as defined by *victim*hood, which ironically is just another iteration of the patriarchal chauvinist framework that the feminists who originated/concocted it claim to be contesting and challenging.  Gender/sex at the core just *is*--it's not defined by what goes on in society or happens to a person in their life postnatally, and that includes whatever victimizing experiences one goes through as a result of how one is classified. ""Humility""?  That's dehumanizing and subordinating on the basis of nothing real.  Why should having a medical condition affecting sex development mean that extra ""humility"" (beyond the general sort that any civilized, decent human being affects) is necessary to be accepted as the sex/gender one *is* due to one's brain wiring?  That's internalized transsexism, period, and one doesn't have to be a ""feminist"" to see that.  (cont. in reply below)"

Cigarettes,fhhbw76,t3_f33uq4,1581600317.0,"Neither.  Even though society has perhaps become overly neurotic about smoking in ways that are themselves unhealthy (and reveal a lot about current approaches/philosophies, which prioritize physical health at all costs and at the expense of overall quality of life for many, but that's a separate issue...), I recognize how unhealthy/toxic this vice/coping mechanism/whatever is and think denying that and ""hating"" the reality of it is selfish and fatuous.

The ""war on teen smoking"" makes perfect sense, sorry.  All research strongly indicates that smoking before the brain is fully developed, at that age, is what's largely responsible for cigarette *addiction*, it's hard not to become unhealthily addicted starting as a juvenile.  I'm glad I didn't smoke my first cigarette until I was 24, as I managed to avoid addiction and I'm sure that's a major factor in why I was able to.  Some teenagers smoke, that's a fact of life, but all things considered they shouldn't, and that's also a fact of life/reality.  They're setting themselves up for years of addiction and potential disability at an age where they're not equipped to make life-altering decisions, and the marketing of tobacco companies that has targeted them is nothing short of morally bankrupt and repugnant greed.

Similarly, other people shouldn't have to be exposed to second-hand smoke (which again, the research is very clear about the detrimental effects of) involuntarily in public spaces.  There's a dark part of me that almost relishes the idea of ""poisoning"" others in this way that stems from bitterness and anguish about being so rejected by mainstream society/culture (for a lot of reasons), but in a sane mindset I don't understand why anyone would be so inconsiderate.

The stigma and universal bans and such might go too far and unfairly limit personal liberty, but this mentality of obdurate head-in-the-sand denialism about what scientific/medical research unambiguously indicates about the effects of smoking (in teenagers and on people exposed to second-hand smoke, for example) is akin at this point in 2020 to flat-eartherism or antivax or whathaveyou.  It's that silly.  I hate to pop this bubble, but there it is."
nasalsnuff,fhh3872,t3_f36w68,1581591727.0,"Nasal snuff in general seems tricky that way--I've found sometimes, especially in the beginning when I just started using it, that the line between actually feeling the nicotine ""high/buzz"" and ODing/feeling nauseous and icky is a fine one, that (perhaps with certain snuffs and under certain conditions?) it's often ""too subtle, can't feel much"" and then suddenly ""*wham*, nausea, ew"" if one's not careful.

When you talk about not believing it's nic OD because you've had experience with stronger snuffs, I've long felt that with forms of tobacco in general some brands/types don't feel right overall in ways that resemble excessive nicotine but aren't entirely about that.  

For instance, there's a certain brand of cigarettes I smoke that are the ultralight version, and when I tried the stronger ""light"" version I felt dizzy, nauseous, just *off* and ill, and didn't think it had much to do with nicotine levels per se as my tolerance was sufficient to handle it (plus, I was just fine with the aroma/flavor profile--I love the flavor of this brand of cig in general and the stronger version was just more of what I liked in the ultralights).  I concluded that that variety of cigarette just has/emits too much carbon monoxide and *that* was the problem, which was confirmed when I looked up the manufacturer/brand specifications and found the carbon monoxide level of that brand to be particularly high compared to other similar cigarettes of its type.  Obviously with snuff it's not CO that's making you feel that way, but perhaps there's something similar with nasal snuffs, some other hidden factor in the tobacco (higher MAOIs?  I'm not familiar with the snuffs you mention but I know Rustica is high in MAOIs and many people find it unpleasantly strong) making you feel like something's amiss.

Also it could definitely be the ammonia.  I *hated* Toque when I first tried it, though I *wanted* to like it, because it's so fresh when they send it that it reeks of ammonia and that made me queasy just opening up the tin, initially.  I later found that I like the flavor of Toque I got just fine and it doesn't make me ill in itself once I let it ""air out"" (leaving the tin open) and the ammonia smell dissipated.  

So, yes, I can relate, and it's probably the ammonia but could be some other aspect of that particular snuff and how it's made that isn't directly about nicotine levels.  This happens, definitely."
nasalsnuff,fhh1nmc,t3_f1jpse,1581589569.0,"After some experimentation (bearing in mind that I'm a novice/dabbling user, have been using nasal snuff off and on for ~6-7 months or so), I sort of feel like it's more effective to take several small ""pinches"" in succession rather than one large pile/pinch.  When I do the latter, it all seems to go up at once and get lodged in my nostril (or higher, yep, that can be a problem, with larger pinches there's less control over how far up it goes) such that much of it is piled on top of itself (if that makes sense?) and the nicotine doesn't absorb as well.  

My theory, which could be nonsense, IDK, is that taking smaller pinches helps the snuff spread more diffusely over a larger surface area of the nasal mucosa and thus the nicotine absorbs more effectively."
Schizotypal,fhh16l7,t3_f2ef2l,1581588905.0,"For StPD, nothing *specifically*.  I do take low-dose lamotrigine and have for years, ostensibly (i.e., ""on paper"", officially) for bipolar depression and mood lability/impulsivity associated with my borderline PD, but it has also helped a great deal I think with schizotypal social anxiety, drastically reduced some positive symptoms related to ""odd perceptions"" and acute paranoia that were severe beforehand (I used to be literally crippled by ideas of reference and fear that every slight noise meant I was about to be home-invaded), and it helps with communicating coherently (tempering/masking metaphors to be comprehensible to others, which, come to think of it, may tie in to how it reduces hypomania for me).

No antipsychotics.  My negative symptoms are much worse and affect my life much more concretely and acutely than my positive symptoms, so they just wouldn't be appropriate in my case and would probably do much more harm than good.  I've thought about it, even relatively recently (as recently as 2018-2019, the past few years--briefly in passing considered Vraylar, Latuda, Abilify, other ones with supposedly lower risk of cognitive impairment), wondered if a low dose of an atypical might change my life for the better somehow given that I *am* on the schizo-spectrum and bipolar, but eh.  Not worth the risk, especially to cognition, for me personally.

Stimulants--including relatively high therapeutic doses of amphetamine--help with my negative symptoms and are really all that has/does, but aren't a magic bullet.

Nicotine seems to be vital for executive function and controlling thought disorganization in addition to contextual social anxiety.  It's a ""medication"" in the sense that my psychiatrist is aware of and has recommended, condones my use of it in the lozenge form at least (though I also use tobacco in two forms off and on, which I'm hoping to quit soon permanently, for obvious reasons and because it messes with my endocrine and immune systems horribly).

A GABAergic depressant--as rightly controversial and risky/dicey as those are--used carefully/judiciously (to avoid outright dependence) has greatly improved my sleep, which used to be dominated by horrific graphic nightmares and sleep paralysis related to my phobia (would perceive slugs crawling on my neck every other day upon awakening, it was awful), that I assume are all StPD-related.

I'm prescribed a powerful gabapentinoid for anxiety (and occasionally take another for sleep quality on rare/special occasions with medical approval) but it honestly seems to make my specifically StPD symptoms worse, or at least they flare up because my inhibitions completely evaporate and the filter/mask that keeps them at bay and from flooding onto the surface--to others/externally and myself/internally--is dissolved when I take it.  I've ended up in some weird places and headspaces taking gabapentinoids schizotypy-wise, FWIW.  They're invaluable otherwise, but that could be considered a downside for me."
Schizotypal,fhgzukv,t3_f2t31z,1581586997.0,"My psychiatrist recommended this a few times in the past if I were to go down the antipsychotic route, but the risk of tardive dyskinesia (it's especially high, a high percentage who develop movement issues, even for an antipsychotic and especially for atypicals!) totally put me off, particularly when I saw a Vraylar patient in one of my inpatient stays who literally couldn't stand still or sit down for any length of time and paced all day, his akathisia was so bad.

That said, on the flip side, it's supposedly less detrimental to cognition due to its particular novel action on the dopamine receptors it binds to, which is subtly but vitally different from other antipsychotics (even other atypicals), and carries less risk of cognitive impairment.  Which is the only reason, really, that my psych mentioned it and that I ever even considered it in passing (during a period when my positive symptoms were flaring up, esp. dissociation, and I felt ""in the slipstream"", like the world wasn't real/was dreamlike most of my waking hours, negative symptoms were as prominent as ever and I was self-medicating by abusing temazepam--bad idea, but I digress).  Still, I decided for myself that it wouldn't be worthwhile in the long run, and am glad today that I didn't go there med-wise.

Seems like overkill for a schizotypal patient IMHO, especially if your positive symptoms aren't extremely severe and you don't have comorbid bipolar mania (full-blown, the kind that type I entails, not hypomania but *mania*).  But I think that's the case for most antipsychotics honestly.  These types of meds, especially at moderate-to-high doses, should only really be taken/given (especially long-term) if you're at the floridly psychotic, out of control, risk-to-others-and-self, Daniel Johnston throwing-keys-out-of-a-plane-in-mid-flight level of symptom presentation, regardless of diagnoses/diagnostic profile.  Short of that and the risk-to-benefit ratio sharply begins to get very dubious.  Just one woman's opinion (I'm BP II/unspecified, schizotypal, borderline and avoidant PD, never had mania or been floridly psychotic)--antipsychotics are severely overprescribed, and even the ""new shiny"" ones like Vraylar have very similar issues to their predecessors that make them potentially life-changing for the worse and a serious decision to go on."
Transsexual,fhgywv2,t3_ey912c,1581585671.0,"I don't want to comment about Yaniv at all, but being late to this thread, just wish to make a couple tangential points, more so responding generally to the spirit of other comments herein.  What follows has more to do with the ""are we a community of post-op transsexuals?"" question and ""SCARs"" idea (I see where OP's coming from, but...goodness no, that's not the right way to go about it...):

* In addition to all the innumerable insane nonsense going on now in/under the entire ""trans"" umbrella, I will say I am worried that if the ""transsexual"" subset of sane people with this condition closes ranks around genital/surgical status that I'll be left out in the cold (which I guess doesn't matter, as I'm already on my own little island with how I view/approach everything, but still bothers me...) and lumped together with the ""trenders""/""tucutes""/""transgender*""/etc., etc.  That would be wrong and here's why.

Again, not commenting on Yaniv directly here but I want to note, as unpopular as it is, that not all ""non-op"" women (and--this is important--I mean in the sense that we *don't seek* genital surgery at all or see our genitalia as undermining our womanhood to whatever degree, not just feel it's indefinitely inaccessible due to finances, complications or whatever) act like obnoxious sociopolitical (""SJW"", though that's a stupid term) ""trans***"" activists, gross fetishists or smug cocky men, ""tucute"" gender-relativist types and so forth.  As much as current media would have you believe otherwise, it's perfectly possible to be a woman with a penis (who's keeping it) and sane, modest and reasonable about gender.  

I'm a hardline trans-essentialist (brain sex, feminine essence theory of transsexuality etc., as far as my etiological beliefs) and ""transmedicalist"" and so forth, greatly prefer to refer to my condition whenever necessary as being of *transsexual* experience, not ""transgender"", but I'm non-op.  I feel that many ""transsexual"" figures who oppose the current of how things have been going in the mainstream ""trans communities"", including the creatrix and mod of this very sub, look down on me for that and view me askance as not ""one of them"", in some residual holdover of the old ""HBS""/""true trans""/""transsexual separatist"" mentalities that were neurotically fixated upon genitalia as the end-all-be-all of who's really authentic.  But we have much more in common than I do with the 'other side': I view this as a medical condition resulting from prenatal neuroendocrine development abnormalities, not an identity or social-political shibboleth; I don't buy into ""nonbinary""/""break the binary"" nonsense, see myself as 100% a binary woman and am gender-conforming; I've medically, legally and socially ""transitioned"" many years ago, have lived my entire adult life as such/myself and am as ""stealth"" as possible these days, and so forth and so on.  I don't think I'm alone in this, either.  Being non-op *in itself* isn't inherently a trait that casts or should cast one into the ""SJW/trender"" or what I call ""gender-relativist"" categories/demographics.

* Multiple people ITT have remarked that we should really ally/align somehow with the intersex community, as our interests and life experiences have far more in common with theirs than what's usually evoked by ""trans"", especially at this point.  I've been saying this for *years*.  IMHO, that's a major aspect of where the transsexual vanguard of the  trans rights movement all went wrong--by choosing to throw their/our lot in with gender benders of all stripes rather than intersex people and frame the condition from that perspective.

* Final point combining the two above, food for thought for those who don't understand and disdain, throw snark at and other me for my deal (ahem, /u/Correctrix).  How I view this as more along the lines of an intersex condition and the cause for our rights in society as akin to intersex rights is in large part *why* I'm ""non-op"".  Traditionally, the crux of intersex activism and narratives in general has often/usually been: ""I'm a binary, normal woman/man, and my genital/sexual development abnormalities I was born with and couldn't control shouldn't affect or undermine that.""  Well, I feel the same way, you see.  I'm a woman, neurologically female, all I want is to be accepted and afforded the exact same dignity and classification afforded every other woman in society--including full access to sex/gender-segregated spaces, bring on the downvotes (what's never said is that with appropriate modesty/propriety, acting like a civilized human being--which the likes of Yaniv and ilk don't do at all--the presence of non-op women in all-female spaces is a non-issue, but I digress)--but I don't feel I should have to get invasive, expensive cosmetic surgery on my aberrant genitalia that I didn't choose to be born with in order to be eligible for that, or that said abnormal genitalia I had no control over having at birth should be seen as saying anything about my ""identity"" or predictive of my behavior.  

The recent stream of intersex activism/thought/etc. has been similarly *against* the societal imperative for people whose reproductive systems and genitalia didn't develop normally to get corrective surgeries to be fully accepted as valid members of their actual sex/gender--but it's *not* in the ""SJW"" stream of ""break the gender binary!"", by and large, either.  Sure, such surgeries are often performed coercively in their case in infancy/childhood, but this autonomy push is advocated for the same reasoning as I share above, and I don't see why it doesn't/shouldn't apply to people of transsexual experience as well.  Intersex people also IMHO reveal what's wrong with the whole ""dysphoria"" obsession in trans narratives, how it plays out and how fixating on that as an ultimate criterion for inclusion in a demographic is misguided (it's an inherent consequence of not getting medical treatment, but I take much issue with how the concept is used as an identity determiner even in current 'transmedicalist' narratives, neither here nor there), but that's a whole other discussion topic, so I'll end here."
TrueCrime,fhdwlu5,t1_fhcfxdl,1581505308.0,"All very good points on the legal side of things.  This combined with the psychopathological points I made in my comments ITT, as someone unfamiliar with the ins and outs of this case itself, leaves me unconvinced of Hernandez's innocence on the basis OP mentions alone, honestly.  That's not to say he *isn't* innocent, it's just that I don't think the case for his innocence is as cut-and-dry or airtight as suggested/implied by this post based on these legal issues and his psychological makeup.  It's important to look at the actual evidence, alibis, etc., etc., all the usual factors one would examine in any case with any other suspect."
TrueCrime,fhdwce3,t1_fhdwbkz,1581504952.0,"(cont.) The **TL;DR** on that is that in theory, purely psychologically speaking, Hernandez could be any combination of schizotypal or schizophrenic and innocent or guilty, with any possible intelligence level up to average (it's nearly impossible he's above-average even if the 70 IQ score is questionable, as an above-average IQ person with either disorder would probably be more self-aware and self-preserving at any point before, during and/or after the interrogation).  Consequently, it's dubious to determine his guilt or innocence primarily based upon these psychological aspects, as the one holdout juror in the first trial apparently did.  And schizotypal and schizo*phrenia* are often misdiagnosed (one erroneously for the other); it takes a rather adroit, perceptive and experienced psychologist to accurately make that diagnosis all the more so the more severe the positive symptoms are and the lower the patient's intelligence and insight/self-awareness are.

Just some thoughts from a true crime enthusiast who has been clinically diagnosed with schizotypal personality disorder.  /r/schizotypal is active, though not as much as most mental-illness related subs, if anyone here is interested in reading more about our firsthand experiences and wishes to see that we're not all creepy people with associations with disturbing crimes.

Take all of this for whatever it's worth."
TrueCrime,fhdwbkz,t3_f2giiu,1581504921.0,"> Imagine that you have a personality disorder

Okay...don't have to imagine, have three.

Uh-oh, not again, not another one.

Oh dear, I knew it.  We get a really bad rap, honestly.  On one hand, it's nice that this juror apparently saw through the demonization and scapegoating of people with StPD and *questioned* Hernandez's supposed role in the crime rather than interpreting his diagnosis and symptoms as further solidifying his guilt, as often happens.  But on the other--not to sound self-interested--it's unfortunate how this rarely-diagnosed and misunderstood disorder is almost completely associated in the public perception with people who violate or supposedly violated extreme taboos that are shocking and 'low' even for types of crime (mass shooters, child killers/rapists, serial killers, etc.--the Wikipedia page for ""People with schizotypal personality disorder"" lists Jeffrey Dahmer, James Holmes the Aurora theater shooter, a controversial and infamous deserter who just walked away from duty in Afghanistan and apparently one guy who was too fat to be executed, lovely).  :-/  Whether Hernandez is innocent or not, I'd like to clarify some things as someone with this diagnosis, which naturally have a bearing on Hernandez's guilt or innocence to the degree that it hinges on his mental illness as the holdout juror quoted decided.

First, schizotypal disorder (there's some controversy about whether it should be classified as a personality disorder--the ICD doesn't, but the DSM does) is not schizo*phrenia* as the OP conflates the two.  They're distinct conditions, and while theorized by many to be part of the same ""schizo- spectrum"", differ a great deal in presentation and severity, and though under certain circumstances (heavy abuse of certain drugs e.g., meth and cannabis) schizotypal can develop into full-blown schizophrenia/psychosis,  it usually doesn't and is stable over a lifetime.  The 'odd perceptions' and delusional-like thinking in StPD typically falls short of the total lack of self-awareness and insight seen in florid psychosis/schizophrenia, and many patients--myself included--are capable of identifying aberrant patterns in their thinking and have some choice as to whether or not to act upon them outwardly in whichever ways (though obviously no ""choice"" over experiencing the thoughts/perceptions in themselves).  We're generally cognizant of what's going on around us and live in an altered form of reality, but not usually the all-encompassing alternative dreamlike state schizophrenia often entails.  

Another segued clarification: though cognitive deficits are present in St(P)D that are similar to but less severe than those in schizophrenia, the disorder doesn't inherently entail lower IQ across the board or significant cognitive disability.  There was a study done that suggested that schizotypal patients qualitatively differed from schizophrenic patients in perception of metaphor and figurative speech (with the former performing equal to or *better* than average controls in this regard, and the latter *worse* than both groups)--which makes sense as pathological schizotypy has much to do with a cognitive style centered upon metaphorical thinking and expression.  This is relevant to this case as a.) if Hernandez really is schizotypal and not schizo*phrenic* (which I have doubts about, elaborated upon below), then all other things being equal, he wouldn't have had as much trouble understanding/interpreting pertinent parts of the interrogation or been inherently ""suggestible"" or ""swayed"" as a result.  Additionally, Hernandez saying things like ""all the people that were down in the basement when he apparently choked Etan, followed him out when he threw the kid away"" and so forth, assuming his diagnosis was accurate, doesn't necessarily indicate lack of comprehension, that ""he has no idea wtf he's talking about"", etc., because it could very well be *metaphorical*--we schizotypals often blend metaphor and literal reality by default, have a bit of a slippery grasp on where the line lies between the two (though less severe cases among us are able to differentiate, but often don't care to or are less able to filter it in ways that will make sense to others, honestly, especially in antagonistic and overwhelming situations like an interrogation; the more stress we're under, the less we're able and inclined to consciously and competently signal what's ""literal"" and what's elaborately ""metaphorical"" in our speech in the moment to accommodate or be comprehensible to neurotypicals--speaking for myself, this happens often and can be an impediment to fluent communication).  

On the other hand, if he's schizo*phrenic*, I could see where that kind of statement would be more likely to indicate that he had nothing to do with the murder and doesn't know what he's saying (floridly psychotic people say all kinds of genuinely nonsensical and more ""random"" things that don't carry as much meaning period even to them, however strange the meaning--e.g., ""word salad""), but even then and regardless of diagnosis, if he hallucinates, it's entirely possible he did kill Etan and hallucinated this stuff that doesn't align with the facts of the case at the time.  And b.) if he was vulnerable to manipulative/railroading interrogation techniques, it's his 70 IQ (assuming that's really the case, also--I imagine true IQ is hard to accurately evaluate for schizophrenic people in florid psychosis or schizotypals who just aren't inclined to conform or comply with tests, authority, or have enough executive functioning trouble that it manifests in being unable to follow instructions and focus enough to undergo intelligence testing) that would most likely be behind that, not his schizotypal (personality) disorder.  That said, it's also very possible that if he is both truly schizotypal and of low intelligence that his apparent confession was a tragic miscommunication, if he had trouble understanding what the interrogators were saying, contextually integrated it along with any misunderstandings into his conceptual inner landscape (as can happen--it's happened to me), and responded in the manner he did because he was under duress and thus unable to communicate that that was what was happening or hint at it somehow to said interrogators, which below-average intellect would render difficult to impossible even under less-stressful conditions.

Here's what makes me wonder about his diagnosis and whether he may have been misdiagnosed: the criteria for schizotypal (personality) disorder are written in such a way as to classify patients who don't involuntarily and consistently experience positive symptoms severe enough to be indicative of full-on psychosis, such as hallucinations and *delusions* (as opposed to ""ideas of"") reference and so on.  In St(P)D, ""seeing visions"" and the like can mean something rather different from outer *hallucinations* in the sense a schizophrenic or someone on psychedelics would experience them--it can be *internal*, involuntary and seem very subjectively ""real"" but not external and apparently disconnected from thought processes. It's difficult to explain, but yes.  If Hernandez hallucinates (in the conventional sense) regularly--which in itself would be tough for a psychologist to discern if he really has a 70 IQ, in itself challenging to accurately assess in such a patient, as above--he could still be schizo*typal* but on the more severe end of the spectrum as far as positive symptoms go, but more likely is schizophrenic or has another psychotic disorder (since he's BP, could be BP w/psychotic features, psychotic depression etc.).  How this affects one's perception of his innocence or guilt depends I suppose upon how much ""literal"" truth one ascribes to his bizarre statements and in which ways.  As mentioned, even if floridly psychotic/schizophrenic at the time, he's not necessarily innocent of the murder itself.

I'd have to research the case more to reach a conclusion/judgment myself on whether Hernandez is innocent, but just on the surface from a psychological standpoint this is a fascinating and really ambiguous case.  It would seem that Hernandez's true psychopathology could range anywhere from being a true schizotypal with a slightly below-average to average IQ who either is innocent and got himself in deep by misinterpreting what the interrogators said (due to his below-average intelligence), integrating it seamlessly into his conceptual/metaphor system (due to his schizotypal disorder) and failing to convey any of that, those cognitive processes, at all (due to a combination of below-average intelligence, elevated contextual stress *and* schizotypal communication patterns/deficits), or guilty and unable or didn't care to dampen his metaphorical expression in communicating with interrogators, to a misdiagnosed severely/floridly psychotic patient (schizophrenia as one possibility, though not necessarily, as bipolar/affective disorders sometimes present with psychosis as well) of unknown/untestable intelligence who either is innocent and didn't know what was going on or what he was saying at all, or guilty and hallucinated during and after committing the murder.

That case was unique in that not only did it rely entirely upon the confession, Wood had to go out of her way to *persuade* investigators that her story was true, and did so vindictively to spite her ex-girlfriend and take her down with her for life.  That one definitely would've gone forever unnoticed if not for the confession and ulterior motives behind it--even the medical examiner only reluctantly changed the victims' causes of death to homicide, as they were smothered to death and ailing, practically in palliative care as it was, so their deaths were even more ambiguous than insulin injections would've been."
UnresolvedMysteries,fgwsaj3,t3_ezkxx6,1581165285.0,"While Bathory's supposed deeds were almost certainly hyperbolically exaggerated for propagandistic reasons/purposes, I seriously doubt that she was entirely innocent.  I can't think of many occasions in history where all of that just comes out of *nowhere* and is totally disingenuous.  She probably severely mistreated servants even by the standards of the time even if not to the incredible degree and in the specific ways she's been accused of, and I also wonder if perhaps she was a lesbian (I've heard this explanation before, though it may not hold any water, there's a long history of vampiric insinuations against lesbian women, so that's interesting to note) but *also* a  predator and that's why the narrative of who she was became so unspeakably negative, even if she wasn't a bloodthirsty sadist per se.  I don't know how this gels with prevailing attitudes at the time, but could it have been ""easier""/more comprehensible or ""honorable"" at the time to frame what young female servants witnessed/knew of/experienced in exaggerated, quasi-metaphorical larger-than-life sadistic terms than simply to process, admit or have any frame of reference to understand them simply being raped (in ways that didn't involve the over-the-top grotesque physical abuse) by another woman?  Or who knows--perhaps she encouraged some of the rumors herself to instill fear and try to retain a strangle-hold on authority?  Hmm...

Regardless, that said, here are a few of mine:

* I think the odds of Emma Fillipoff still being alive are quite low and that searching for her, is, sadly, likely to prove futile, especially if done under the assumption that she's living as a transient somewhere.  She would have had to snap out of the psychotic episode she was so floridly experiencing at the time of her disappearance to stay alive, and if she did, she'd remember who she was and her family, her memory wouldn't just be wiped, and if so would've likely found her way home or established a life known to others at least by now.  Psychosis just doesn't work that way, the way it would have to for the theory of her now living as a drifter in some distant place to be true.  I guess it's *possible* she eventually recovered enough to preserve her own existence and consciously decided to make a clean break, but from everything reported about her personality, I find that unlikely.  Most likely, she either actively or accidentally/passively committed suicide (by wandering into the woods or a lake or who knows where, or starving to death, which she was on track to do as it was...), ending that episode and her life.

* The official (non-) narrative/motive of the Las Vegas Paddock shooting, Paddock's supposed occupation, etc. is bunk that was cobbled together on purpose to discourage media coverage and cover up the real scenario.  Even the supposed fact of what was found on his laptop and then that his brother was subsequently arrested for is suspicious and reeks of distraction/diversion and hasty demonization (what more efficient way could be done of promulgating the idea that ""this was a bad, bad guy""?).  No, I certainly don't think it was a ""false flag"" or anything like that, but I don't buy that it was necessarily a conventional mass shooting that Paddock planned and executed by himself or even necessarily committed at all.  Something absolutely stinks about everything about that case, and I think it's entirely possible that it was some sort of international arms deal or espionage incident or who knows what gone wrong, may have turned into a revenge attack or terrorist attack, and was covered up and explained away as a ""mass shooting"" by a lone-wolf perpetrator because otherwise the implications for diplomacy in some regard could've been enormously messy.

* This is more of a general one, but I sincerely suspect that in many instances police departments and prosecutors know, have a pretty solid idea that they could try to build a case on, what happened and whodunit in cold cases, but due to complicating circumstances (ab)use their discretion to make coldly utilitarian decisions not to actively pursue where their investigations end up leading them under the rationale that ""it can't bring victims back"", perhaps in certain cases that perpetrators have at least suffered some form of justice (when they're jailed on unrelated charges, etc.) and/or are no longer an active threat/risk to society, and that it would better ""protect and serve"" the interests of the community overall to just let sleeping dogs lie.  

I think this is probably what happened in the Alyssa Turney case honestly--that some information suddenly came to light, something murky that Michael Turney had on the PPD from his time in law enforcement that could completely besmirch its reputation in the eyes of the public and be complicated and messy, or something corruption-related that runs deep and is somehow related to his brother James and his distant familial, historical political ties, that dissuaded them from prosecuting--because of how they did such a sudden and inexplicable about-face on charging him and have been obviously blowing Sarah off and passive-aggressively frustrating her efforts to push for prosecution ever since.  Somebody higher-up nixed that decision, for some reason they were able to justify to themselves, which him spending a decade in prison on the explosives charges may have made a little easier, as warped and incomprehensible as that would be to the public at large who wants justice for Alyssa's case.

I wouldn't be surprised if this is also true in the case of Joanne Pedersen.  At the very least, the RCMP must know a lot more than has been publicly revealed or acted upon, as it's bizarre how that case just up and died after major leads in the form of the letters appeared decades later in response to the reenactment skit posted online.  My guess is that the suspect they were led to--who *was* either the letter-writer himself or a relative thereof, which the letters confirmed, and who probably also was the man in the phone booth she was seen with--was mentally-ill or disabled in some way (I tend to believe the IED theory on Websleuths, myself), didn't *intend* to kill her and may have thought he was helping but things went awry somehow, and importantly, had some tie to a prominent community member such that prosecuting him would've been somewhat awkward, and after so long they didn't think it'd be worthwhile to bother.  Or he died, so there's nobody to charge, and enough time has passed that they just decided not to open some can of worms in some way by bringing the case to fruition.

It's sad to think that closure for victims takes a back seat in this way to bureaucratic concerns and convenience, but I'm almost convinced that in some of these cases it just does in the perception of law enforcement.  They probably perform a calculus in certain cases that weighs the risk of public controversy, taxpayer expense, messiness with prominent higher-ups and risk of jeopardizing the careers of good investigators, etc., etc. with the justice/closure potentially provided by the outcome of pursuing it and, sometimes, ultimately decide it isn't worthwhile in the scheme of things or the long run the way the cost/benefit ratio comes out.

* The taxi driver played more of an active/malevolent role in Holly Bartlett's death than mere apathetic negligence."
UnresolvedMysteries,fgwjcoi,t1_fgq2eli,1581161847.0,"Ooh, now *this* is truly an unpopular opinion that I've had for a while.  I wholeheartedly agree, and I'd even go a little further in articulating my issue with this trend: I find it disturbing the way true-crime people who purport to be concerned and advocates for victims not only infantilize every minor victim like this, a trend that seems to be growing (and as you said, there really is a vast difference between teenagers and young children/pre-adolescents), but also take issue with the way they hamfistedly 'angelicize' all child-victims in general regardless of age in ways that gloss over and erase their individual personalities, which ironically perpetuates the same dehumanization such people hope to combat.

Especially in cases involving minors with any sexualized assault/abuse element, you see people doing this in spades (going out of their way to wring their hands and emphasize victims' youth--""Oh!  She was a *kid*, just a *kid*, a little baby!"") to overcompensate/correct impressions and connotations planted by perpetrators and irresponsibly/negligently amplified by the media (that vaguely associate victims with precociousness and adult-like qualities and frame their cases in the same lurid terms as those involving adults).  Now those connotations are icky, and I do see their point in doing this to correct course, but at a certain point it starts to feel contrived and a form of censorious and un-nuanced groupthink, which honestly is also ""icky"" to me.  There's a finer line where referring to a victim as ""just a little baby kid, so this was horribly tragic and hang the bastard perpetrator"" doesn't feel too terribly different from ""just a little baby kid, not really a full human being, so therefore disposable, no great loss"" that is the attitude of some perpetrators.  No human being should be defined solely by their age.

As unpopular as it is to say this, too, I think it's somewhat problematic that child victims are always portrayed as especially tragic exclusively because of their ""potential"", who they *may* have been in their later lives, according to glorified glurgy assumptions of ""Nancy Grace""/true-crime-mommy types.  Or ""oh, how sad, so-and-so will never get to experience (insert stereotypical social ritual activity here)"" and so forth.  This feels like it's more about using individual victims as interchangeable platforms to score social approval outrage points and reinforce social norms.  Even young child victims should be appreciated and mourned for who they actually *were*, not who the ""Nancys"" think they would've/could've been.  As someone pointed out in a YouTube comment I read recently, JonBenet Ramsey could've become a heroin addict for all we know.  It was a crude and meanspirited way of putting it, but I understand the frustration with the deification of such victims based on their supposed ""potential"", as if that's all the value children actually have.  

I mean, even a 5-10 year-old is not an *infant*, an apparently blank amorphous slate and corpuscle of pure innocence and yet-unrealized 'potential' with no individuated personality or identity.  Certainly teenagers, but also children that age, have much more solidly crystallized personalities and senses of personal identity than people seem to think/realize, and it's grossly dismissive in a way that devalues them to gloss over this in the supposed interest of protecting them somehow from creepy narratives.  With even very young victims such as JonBenet Ramsey, Jessica Ridgeway, or Joanne Pedersen (just three examples that spring to mind), I wonder, like to think about who they were and what they were actually like as *people* even at the early ages when their lives were cut short.  I think most adults forget so easily what it was like to be those ages, that when they were teens and even preteens they didn't feel like just ""kids"" with only vague-generic and interchangeably nascent/""innocent"" hopes/dreams/fears/preferences/personalities.  A child's inner world is a lot more complex than that--different yes, developing yes, but that gets wrongly (IMO) conflated with dull simplicity.  People in younger-adult generations sometimes differentiate their dogs' individual ""personalities"" more than they recognize those of children, which is just ridiculous to me.  This issue goes both ways in true crime, too, methinks--it's behind why so many can't wrap their minds around the idea that Burke, for example, could've had dark/nefarious motives and been a child *perpetrator* even at 9.

I fear that this attitude, also, especially as it's expanding with respect to teens as lifespans increase and 'childhood' conceptualization is extended, will only add fuel to the fire and end up legitimizing distorted-thinking abuser/perpetrator perceptions to the effect that minors are mini-adults, various abuses/problematic attitudes toward whom are justifiable, when they see the ever-more extreme contrast between the deified-infantilization and reality of what children and teenagers are actually like, their humanity, ""warts and all""."
UnresolvedMysteries,fgwaahk,t1_fgoct66,1581158780.0,"I think it's possible that's a case, among others (there are a handful that I've had this thought/intuition about, though they don't come specifically to mind atm), where he was technically innocent of one particular thing but an absolute sociopathic scumbag guilty of other crimes who was set up on purpose by people in the community/around him to remove him from society and finally get some justice served."
UnresolvedMysteries,fgw9efg,t1_fguoqpd,1581158548.0,"Bundy was a rare exception (in my view) of a serial killer, or infamous perpetrator in general, whose victims were in some cases much more interesting than he actually was.  Rhonda Stapley in particular comes to mind."
UnresolvedMysteries,fgw95o7,t1_fgq1pgl,1581158447.0,This.  It has all the hallmarks of an unsubstantiated moral panic along the same lines as the ones in the 70s-90s that contemporary people like to turn their noses up at and haughtily pretend they're well beyond perpetuating.
UnresolvedMysteries,fgw8um3,t1_fgowdi7,1581158313.0,"Yep, that wouldn't surprise me in the least.  As someone who was briefly but passionately involved in the old-school H/P (mainly phreaking) scene for some years around the tail end of it, my 'unpopular opinion' is that it was definitely *not* only possible as an 'inside job' (never messed with this technology but we did a *lot* of things on a major scale that weren't/wouldn't have been thought to be possible for ragtag rank outsiders, I'll just leave it at that...), and that that theory has been relentlessly promoted because of the embarrassment, that 'they' don't want anyone to know that it was indeed very possible for dedicated hobbyist hacker/phreak kids to pull off.  And that it was, indeed, even if partially an 'inside job', connected to the H/P scene in that area at the time.  The whole thing just reeks of old-school phreak types from miles away, haha, and I would know.  ;-P"
UnresolvedMysteries,fgw7bqv,t3_f0kap9,1581157794.0,"* Nighttime Podcast

The exclusive interview Jordan did with Lindsay Souvannarath is what brought my attention to this one, last year.  Initially I was very put-off by his hosting style honestly, and made a Reddit comment that sharply criticized the way he handled the interview overall, bent over backwards to saturate it with content warnings, and didn't ask her about the ideological process of how she acquired her political beliefs (which, frankly, is something I was really and remain interested by).  But with time and more context--an interview he did on another podcast where he explained his rationale for approaching it the way he did, why the case was so important to him and how he came to cover it, etc.--I softened, understood where he was coming from and regretted that initial criticism.  His whole style grew on me and I quickly became a fan.  

I still roll my eyes sometimes at his dorkiness (but in an affectionate way, haha), and am not as fond of the silly non-true-crime urban/rural legend material he covers sometimes (zany but passe stuff like Bigfoot, UFOs, etc.), but I like the scope and his range, capable of seriously and professionally covering very serious crimes with compassion and nuance yet also wackier, lighter ground such as the outsider musician Tonetta, the Halifax Glove Guy (which, guiltily, remains hilarious to me--sorry to the victims who were directly sexually harassed by him, I know that's not funny but he's just so absurd and brazen I can't help but laugh), etc. with humor and levity but appropriate restraint and gravity at the same time when applicable.  The Emma Fillipoff series, brief but impactful Joanne Pedersen episode, aforementioned Lindsay Souvannarath series, and many others are highlights.  Well worth listening to, especially if you're an American like myself whose knowledge of strange goings-on in our neighbor to the North is scant beforehand.

* Voices for Justice

Others have recommended this, Sarah Turney's podcast, and I can't reaffirm that recommendation strongly enough, for all the reasons mentioned ITT and elsewhere.  I recommend listening to ""Missing Alyssa"" and at least a few of the interviews Sarah has done on other podcasts to get a sense for the case and its particulars before delving in, and once you do you'll be amazed at how thoroughly your curiosity and anger the case incites is gratified.  Splendidly done, hats off to Sarah.

* The Fall Line

This one is a fantastically well-researched podcast that sheds light on obscure cases involving marginalized victims (mostly/all PoC, thus far?) who were overlooked due to societal biases reflected in the justice system, in the Southeast (mainly Georgia).  Socially important, but beyond that, the podcast itself is well-produced, thorough, refreshingly doesn't come across as exploitative or self-congratulatory despite the various dynamics at play between the hosts and the victims' families and so forth.  The hosts came across as goofy, giddy and immature on the Crawlspace Podcast, which is what taught me to take other podcasters' appearances on that one with a grain of salt and not form first impressions based upon them, as I nearly didn't listen to theirs because of this (there are many certain 'vibes' I find rather offputting and irritating in true crime podcasters, I'm picky/selective and judgmental in this area I admit), but I'm so glad I gave it a chance, because as soon as I did, immediately, it was apparent that they're professional, dignified and not self-aggrandizing or frivolous in the least."
