bipolar,fmau6js,t1_fmagnu6,1585907978.0,"I don’t mean to be rude but if you’re going to be a counselor then please never say it’s “only” BP2. It’s insidious and as life-ruining as BP1. But not as well-understood, so trying to explain it can be exhausting and humiliating. It’s too easy for outsiders to minimize so please let’s not minimize it ourselves! Sorry for the rant."
bipolar,fm3zcx4,t1_fm3uy37,1585742195.0,Thank you so much for sharing this. What triggered this manic episode? What made this one full blown to tip you into BP1? I’m curious because I’m a rapid cycling BP2 with mixed states who has been warned by more than one psychiatrist that I’m right on the edge.
BipolarReddit,fj3c8mt,t3_faxptx,1582978091.0,I’m rapid cycling and my physician also warned me about the “kindling effect” of my episodes- it takes less and less stimulus/triggers to spur another episode of either hypo mania or depression. This is the scariest thing for me and what keeps me religious about my medication. Here is more reading about it: https://pro.psychcentral.com/the-kindling-hypothesis-is-it-relevant-in-psychiatry/

medicalscribe,fa55wxu,t1_fa513jb,1575811907.0,"Is it in writing somewhere about the 90 day pay raise? I’m asking bc they were already funny with me about pay when I was hired (first interviewer told me $10/hr, 2nd interviewer got really weird and was firm about $9/hr, something to do with my area being a former PhysAssist site) and I would like to back myself up before talking to her"

medicalscribe,f3y8gir,t1_f3wf0uv,1571250191.0,Thank you! I’ll try this
civilengineering,f29rupv,t3_dcjpte,1570103222.0,Thank you for commenting! I love the idea of an youtube series or an AMA even to start with and build his enthusiasm. I can just write the mods?
caregivers,ewh78ez,t3_co721u,1565399770.0,"Honestly, thank you for sharing this story because I’ll be starting RN school and now I’ll definitely be more mindful of this on clinicals. It sucks that for us the mistakes we make on the job can actually hurt people, that’s the scary trade-off for wanting to help people professionally. You’re still a caring person and I hope you feel better soon."
AvPD,eue33yl,t3_cfxd87,1563734088.0,"Interestingly I just had an appointment this week with a new psychologist specifically to assess for AvPD (or atelophobia). I specifically chose her because she treats people with these conditions here in South Florida. We spoke prior to our appointment on the phone about my symptoms and then at length during the appointment, and she believes I may actually have Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder? Something about being inflexible and obsessed with the “correct” way to do things (and so I don’t have anymore relationships because of my shame in being imperfect). I’m going soon for a diagnostic evaluation with her colleague. The kicker is I’m paying out of pocket and this all costs a fortune. I lived in the UK for awhile and I eventually went to get a diagnosis with a private psychiatrist in central London because my NHS physicians were just not on it. Maybe you can look up specialists who specifically treat this and call them, I think a lot now offer Skype appointments and sliding scale."

StudentNurse,erkcgub,t3_c2c90j,1560960378.0,"Hi, I’m Bipolar too. I struggle with my condition. I knew I wanted to be a nurse but I knew I couldn’t handle a 3-4 year program (already tried it with a different degree). I’m booksmart but I freak out during exams. So I broke it up. Went to a 6 month PCT program and went to work in an ER, then a year long LPN program and went to work in home health, and now about to LPN-RN, but this’ll be my third time restarting because of severe anxiety the last 2 times I attempted.  Anyway, so many of the students are also going through tough things, or have friends/family going through things, so don’t feel like a weirdo if you have to go to administration about anything. BUT only disclose your condition to classmates you really trust, if at all, your reputation really matters as a nurse and all it takes is one ignorant/misinformed person to gossip. Your goal this year is to learn enough to pass your tests and ultimately the NCLEX, the NCLEX is the prize. Download a NCLEX app (I’m using RN mastery) and start answering questions from the beginning of your program, it’s the best thing you can do for yourself. 10-20 questions a day relating to the subject you’re studying. I’m answering questions now 2 months before my program even starts. You won’t know the answers but that’s ok, pick any answer, so you can learn the right answer and most importantly read the rationales, they are how you’ll learn how to answer questions on your exams. Focus on questions on which “all answers are right, but which is the most right” , because those are the toughest during your program and on the NCLEX. Then pay attention to skills like bed linen changing, wheel chair transfers, diaper changes, things like that, bc I saw students blow them off bc “that’s the CNA’s job” but you’ll feel terrible when you eventually have to do it on your own and you’re clueless and the patients are unimpressed. Also, take every opportunity to practice injections, IV insertion, pump set up, etc, practice as much as you can IN SCHOOL and ask all the questions you need to. Especially insulin injections! Volunteer for those patients during clinicals, make your mistakes, manage the anxiety. I slinked away from practicing that bc of my anxiety and had to learn on the job, pretending I knew what I was doing (ex. watching a YouTube video on insulin injection before giving one to a 5yo with autism and seizure disorder who wasn’t still for a minute, the worst). Sometimes reading the powerpoints are enough, depending on the teacher. Search Quizlet and AnkiApp, Crash course and RegisteredNurseRN on YouTube, and podcasts. For me working as an LPN, for what it’s worth, the head to to assessment (esp lung sounds) pharmacology and symptom identification have been the most important. Anyway sorry for this info dump, I hope it helps, good luck"
