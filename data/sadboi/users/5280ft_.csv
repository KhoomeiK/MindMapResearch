FreeCompliments,f8r4iaz,t3_e1h5bp,1574731760.0,"This comment will probably go unnoticed but I'd just like to take this chance and tell you how gorgeous you are. Maybe, a voice inside you is telling you things such as ""you don't look good"" , or things like ""you are not enough"" but even though I don't know you personally, I can see it in your eyes and say how wonderful you are as a person. Having a mental health problem is a very huge challenge but please don't give up. There will be better days and you might not see it now but in time, you'll realize how strong you are! Sending so much love!"
