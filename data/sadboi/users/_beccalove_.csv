I’m so sorry this happened to you. 
She is unprofessional and a mean person. Please don’t give up on therapy if you are having suicidal thoughts. There are good therapists out there who can and will support you. Don’t forget that you can “shop” for a therapist until you find one you click with. Sometimes it takes a few people before you find one that works!"
mentalhealth,etfib3a,t1_etfi8ta,1562770308.0,Totally understand and so glad you found someone to help!
Showerthoughts,etfg4c0,t3_cbb8nf,1562768883.0,Bottom left. I speak of it freely!
mentalhealth,etffokc,t3_cb8qr3,1562768592.0,This makes me so angry. I’m a licensed social worker and a suicide loss survivor and if you give me your state and county I will find resources for you. I’m so sorry you had to deal with that bullshit. There are people who care about what happens to you (as evidenced by 96 responses to this post!) Much love to you.
mentalhealth,etfffqs,t1_etei2o0,1562768427.0,So much yes to this
GriefSupport,etcj3on,t3_cay871,1562685939.0,"It’s so so hard to live with this guilt. I know no matter how many times people say there’s nothing you could have done, the guilt creeps back. My son called me the night he died and I didn’t pick up and it will haunt me forever. I wish I had some way to lift this from you (and from myself). Maybe in time it will feel less heavy? I just wanted you to know that you aren’t alone."

He was a character- when he posted a photo of these tattoos on FB, it was with the caption “sorry mom” haha - he was the one who told me Reddit was better than FB. I think he would have loved this. ❤️ Thank you all for your help and support! ~Kaleb’s Mom, forever 25~"
