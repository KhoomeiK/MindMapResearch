But 100 years ago this is learly described by Marcel Proust in his great novel (In Search for the Lost Times) - where  the background stories happen during the Dreyfud affair /when an innocent Jew was accused falsely but it was kept secret for years/ There clearly the public was as split as today about (let us say) on climate or the virus. Always - since Antiquity it is documented - there were a more Strict (paranoid, racis) ""Party"" and an opposite one, a more  Liberal one (some claim  it is due to Strict Fathers and Abandoning Mothers) - and yes, there always was a huge mixed-heritage group too. Statistics say that extremism is generally 20 % (on both sides). /But OP is basically right, before the racist and groupist mass-murders of the 20th century it was not so evident, that even a minor irritation can have life-threatening consquences.

Both sides have partial proofs.  There are news claiming higher C and D vitamins (and some others) do have some beneficial effects in some cases of the present virus. It may do harm in certain very special cases (like terminal cancer), when it is all the same already. But as I am overall well - but for some other illness I must take less carbs - I do need a few supplements and vitamines. There are many arguments here pro and contra - I doubt it is possible to really go into it on reddit without knowing each other. I simply feel less tired - I am in r/over60 (closer to 70) and that better balance in my energy levels  is enough for me to do as I deem best. We are in a pandemic.

So the main Jewish answer  is that today Cannibal paganism ceased so there are no pagans and simularly the gender issue is nondangerous hence a non issue - despite antigay Orthodox extremism but some atheists are antigay too so it is not the mainstream in Judaism and everywhere it is slowly marginalized.

But Christianity is just a version of Judaism. Judah was just one tribe in Israel - they did nit want to be fair: they saw that not everyone is mature enough to be  Grateful/= hoodi/ for Ya /=eternal. It needs a special attitude. And knowledge. Being fair is a 19th century British sporting ethical demand. Christians just wanted to bring this good tradition from tribal Judaism to everywhere. Exactly because even before the word fair existed in this sense they were thinking it would be nice to unify dispersed and warring and mistruszful unloving humans.

So unfortunately today's religious people - as I did mention referring to Jewish extremists on the topic - simply do not know the facts in their mostly mythological legendary books.

sure all feelings have neuron-level and hormone-level and even DNS-level descriptions, but to claim it ""refutes"" analysis is like we would say to a description of a Pyramid that in reality it is just a bunch of electrons.(But I do agree that dream theory is not ""scientific"" (=no proofs exist for symbolic expressions meanings hence is not ""falsifiably"" or prsentable with statistics). But that does not discredit Freud. While we do recall dreams with eyes called (generally or many times) we move our eyes - and eye movement therapy does have statistical proofs for its destressing effect. Of course Freud did know about it partly as a Charcot-disciple who used hypnosis /= including eye movements for it/ amd because the effect of eye movings are in the Talmud /Brachot 55B/ which he did learn with one of his first clients, the Lubavicher Rebbe (Shalom Dovber) in the 1890s. It is very important to accept (as Freud did accept) gays and do all possible things to defend them - but Freud speaks about homophobia as a paranoid symptom and we cannot deny it exists - and if a gay person has compulsive symptoms (any addiction including sex fantasy addictions) he can use Freudian therapy well (and he will probably be a better -calmer - person without his symptoms. ) Gayness cannot be ""cured"" but Feud never told it should be cured. Homophobic paranoia should be cured on the other hand.

Israel,fpywzpu,t3_gfvfwk,1589010115.0,"I can only circumvent Leftie antijudaism by not reading them. And the other way is to remember that words are just words. Originally the Ten Israeli tribes came partly from Egypt ( the name BenYamin meaning Southern) - as Patai ( with Graves) describes it. So the only returning non captive non-lost tribe Judah/=Jew comes from yehudi/ was later turned into this ethnic people - and ther version of the Bible-focus became the Jewish religion and lastly they are the Jewish State. But some Nazis and  Anti Semites always did claim that Jews are not real Jews ( they stem from Turkic Caucasian non-Semite Khazars a lost tribe - as Koestler described it but no genetic proofs exist). And Danish people are coming from  Dan  and the Brit also come from the word brit/=covenant/ and there are other such ""chimera"" fantasies. So this way of looking at the fantasies around Judaism is similar to the Jewish Kabbalist idea about some ethnically Jewish people having "" revived"" soul roots from Egypt or Rome - the Jungian Shadow. They claim biblical names are metaphors anyway not real entities. 

This helps me to realize that anti-Jewish feelings may be needed for some people for many different psychological imbalance-correction. But when you confront them they say: we did not mean to harm a real Jewish person. We refer to war being bad ( and forgot wars were almost always started by Arab states there who are 100 times as big). We are not against Jews just Zionists. My best friends are Jews or I myself am one ( Chomsky, Sanders, Lenin, Marx) so how can you imagine I am criticizing them to incite murders? I just think they are too Commies. Or too Capitalist. Or too anti Christ or too anti God.

As many Leftist friends regularly start anti Israeli rants nowadays - since years mainly when drinking - I have only one way to stop them. I say how do you know that you do not have Jews in your ancestry aming the once lost trives of Israel who mingled with other people? Maybe you are right and Jehudim/Jews are not okay. 

But what if they were all mingled.  What if Judah+BenYamin are not really Jews ( we know they are partly Egyptians). What if the real Israel ( as the Church has always called itself) is really you with this  many hatred in your heart? 

Okay they never listen to me if I start this rant. Haha."

DebateAChristian,fpype9w,t3_gfx0n0,1589007509.0,"The origin of a future ""appearance"" of Moses is in Moses in the 5th book 18: 18-20.  But the resurrection ( Valley of Bones from Ezekiel 37) was meant to be seen by the Seer in * in a distant future*.

Jesus considered himself - or wondered aloud - to be the new prophet predicted by Moses /Luke 7:19/. 

5Moses 20 says that only if people will ""see with their own eyes"" whatever the Seer predicted can he be accepted a *true prophet or Seer*. 

When we will see the first AI quantum computer reviving someone's brain after death - then will we see that Moses was right - and Jesus had to predict this revival if he wanted to be  True Prophet and then his - decades later- chroniclers needed to see instances in visions about revuvals. But those were all future visions if not a hypnotic trance.

But we are the first generation that might ""see with our own eyes"" as predicted. Kurzwell told it will be possible to save a brain neuron setup in the 2030s. Let us be patient."

AskOldPeople,fpymp90,t3_gg39ok,1589006414.0,I read that dairy diminishes testosterone. Which is protecting us from Alzheimer. So I am a bit wondering about it. In a short net search it turns out that testosterone has a different impact on Caucasians ( a name for Whites - originally Turks like Azeris) compared to others. I am a mixed one. So I must look around for more info. BTW it is the lactose that has -like gliadin- an effect of blocking testosterone ( by an opioid peptine). But butter has minimal lactose. So I can stop my complete diet of dairy. Thanks for OP - it is so good to be alert mentally and grasp such complex processes as I am not a science guy...

DebateReligion,fpykem3,t3_gg45v2,1589005393.0,"I am in a Judaism Studies Ph.D. program. In the Bible text we are informed that non-hetero sex was required from the Human/Child sacrificer priests in all non Israelite tribes and people surrounding them. And they were Cannibals. / Urns were found - thousands- with child bones charred in the region./The burnt children - firstborn killing was obligatory for thousands of years - were eaten. And if you read the Book of Kings you can see that the humansacrificers demanded the Israelie kings to folllow them and * lead their children over the fire* ( Which is euphemism or a censored  way of writing). 
/Naturally "" god"" is a human fantasy ideal' s name -  not a real outer source of information. So this part of OP is absurd but very frequent argument./

 But the * false translation* argument is  true partly - but after all in those days the word denoting non-heteros was evidently referring to Cannibals.

 It is not by chance that Judaism does not consider Muslims and Christians * pagans*. Because they are not eating/killing children. They are brothers in belief in a Central Focus. But despite their knowledge that it is not about gays some groups of Judaism accept the anti-gay stance ( but cannot force it on the state today).

 Also most atheist Soviet and Chinese Communist imprison gays. Basically the majority fears minorities. It does not need to use Biblical texts - it is psychology. Homophobia stems in the disrupted families ( it being  Freud' s only accepted because statistically proven claim) - homophobes are all projecting their hatred against nonloving parents upon minorities ( aming them gays.)"

It does not mean you have a problem in your younger years.. And some decide that a bit of Alzheimer at 95 is not such a big issue - life is so full of suffering that oblivion is the best.

It is vain to imagine it will ever change - it was always the same way. Except we only feel its bad part in the present. Who cares if in the Past someone was pro Communist like Sartre or anti  Stalinist like Orwell...we can appreciate them. But the present proponents of these stances are hated by opponents as much as Sartre and Orwell was hated 70 years ago. There existed a small minority that could be on good terms with both positions' representants. But it is rare. The mass needs hatred as it breeds dopamine and other hormones.

AskALiberal,fpd6t4p,t3_gcqfcj,1588521028.0,I run a Senior Inventors Club in a nursing home - now mainly by phone. We invent new card games and quizes or both together. We are also doing readings and singing and other fun activities. Our home is run by religious leaders - and people do trust them even if nonreligious. Let us not forget that the first pensions were given in Germany from the 1870s. (Bismarck - see wiki). But a few 1000 years ago old people were just sent to the mountains to die of hunger. In Japan it was so a few 100 ys ago still. Anyway as in the 1700s years due to untreatable illnesses and mass hunger the average age was 20-30 years. 40 was old. 60 - 70 was like 90 now. So Senior Homes can be wonderful. Like all human institutions sometimes a sociopathic director may be abusive to service personnel or clients. But in most of the cases it is very nice in my experience. If I wd need constant care ( generally because I was undisciplined and did not go to therapy and did not discipline myself in the needed diet - low carb no sugar etc which helps to a nicer linger ageing - and so I developed diabetes and obesity and other destructive conditions - well what could be better than a Senior Center? Generally they have swimming pools and the clients ate taken to excursions and there are lots of activities and good catering and instant medical care. I do not think it would be bezter if I pressured my adult kids to care for me.

monarchism,fpcnx1s,t3_gchimp,1588507437.0,I am Hunian partly but partly from Italy and Aragón/ Salerno/Naples. We should include Hungary in that new kingdom. Maybe we should start it as an e-kingdom or as an r/kingdom. Or FB kingdom. I found that the Savoyas had Medici and Bourbon ancestors ( and Habsburgs and Brandenburgers and Brunswicks too) and all had a common Hungarian-Polish king ancestor called Zapolya. In the 1500s. Who had Byzantine Paleologi among theit ancestors who lead up to the Davidic house of Jesus ( thru exilarchs in Bagdad in the 12th v-). So yes I think we should create an electronic kingdom and than people can opt for it when the time arrives to make it on earth too.

Bipolar does not mean up-and-down in minutes...but sometimes yes it does include that too. My mom was bipolar. And I was diagnosed it too and put on lithium but another doctor claimed I was border and another that I was schizoid.I had epilepsy too. So I decided to try live addiction self help like r/12steps and eventually - in years - I managed to handle my inner volatility and started a normie life. My only problem is I must have a nap each daytime ( sometimes twice a day)- and I wake up regularly at night. And before that nap I get very sad and tired and unfocused. And after it I get very crisp and fresh and upbeat. So it does remind me of bipolarity if it is maybe an atypical version due to decades of drugs and decades of therapies.

psychoanalysis,fpclasn,t3_gcm8nw,1588504799.0,Analysis is not interested in any kind of instant solution or drug. That is why it is called psychoanalysis. It claims that if you do analyse your psyche you will be able to handle any trouble by that knowledge. BTW I never heard any p-analyst ever mentioning CBT. Partly because the main figures died decades before it became a fad a few years ago. I doubt it is prevalent among serious p-analysts to comment on weird social factoids.
