If anyone‚Äôs curious, it all started after eating some mushrooms one night in college when I was drunk. It was an awful time and I woke up the next day with some intense depersonalization and derealization and psychedelic like effects. Everything still ‚Äúbreaths‚Äù, lights have giant halos, objects have trailers behind them, and there is a ‚Äústatic‚Äù known as visual snow covering my entire vision. I thought I was going crazy until I met someone else who has the same exact symptoms as me from LSD use and told me about HPPD. I looked it up in the DSM and it was spot on to what I was experiencing. It‚Äôs extremely anxiety inducing and frowned upon due to the use of drugs. I made a stupid decision in college and have never felt or seen the same since.

Tl;dr: ate mushrooms when drunk years ago, still have visual effects, no mental health professional has been able to help me."

Throw every vst and sample on tracks with names and colors right away to help with organization. It makes mixing a lot easier. 

Learn the use of delay, stereo, reverb, etc. figure out how to leave mixes open for vocals. Google searches can help you really well on this one. 

Good luck! Just a few I had from the top of my head when drinking some coffee. Your ear will become more fine tuned as time goes on."
