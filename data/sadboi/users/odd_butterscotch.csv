Just and idea to look into"

OCPoetry,fqxjqgi,t1_fqvdstn,1589733370.0,"Your comment caused me to re-read your poem, it makes somewhat more sense now but I would say that anyone who does the sort of things your subjects do have quite a bit of decision making power, not everyone who suffers goes down that path and not everyone who goes down it is suffering, but I don't want you to think your poem is bad, the imagery is powerful as I wrote previously like the way you set it ""San Francisco 1853"""
OCPoetry,fqt92f3,t3_gkn3sc,1589633546.0,"Hi, I like the sound of your work, I really like the way you set the poem as well. I have another comment that isn't specific to your poem and its on the use of the word ""drunks"" I feel this is a marginlizing word, like it puts a bunch of people into a amorphous blob and dismisses them, as if they are non-people,also you have separated them from workers as if people with addiction challenges don't work I note this only because in this society we associate working with goodness (ie: marginalize those on welfare) this criticism is meant to hopefully expand your worldview and isn't meant to be taken as harsh. I hope it is valuable."

I have been drawing periodically but have time to really concentrate on it and I have just started watching your videos I look forward ti watching the one about not being ready to do a piece as I have a piece that I totally felt I wasn't ready to do and so aborted it halfway through and have since lost it unfortunately"
learnart,f8vaoox,t1_f8pbfvg,1574864658.0,"I saw a video online about values and the thing I remember is ""The lightest dark is darker than the darkest light"" which you may find helpful, I was using the colour picker on inkscape and noticed the shadows on the ruffles are kind of light (though I am not nearly as experienced an artist as you so these are super amateur observations)"

StopSelfHarm,f8v9oxb,t3_e23lxy,1574863860.0,"Hi, I'm super glad that you had a good person in your social circle who could help you when you needed it. I made a thing called Managing a Crisis and Dealing With Living, some of it is borrowed, and some of it I came up with from my own experiences, its like a check list, my favorite part is START (Survive Tolerate Adapt Rejuvenate Thrive) I hope that it can help you, if you reformat it in libreoffice or word it can be printed on one page.

arttocope,f8v65lo,t3_e25l15,1574860811.0,"if you are down to draw that you are probably down to learn how to draw more extensively, there are tons of youtube videos online which are super cool (I really enjoy watching the time-lapse videos of people drawing things usually included while they are explaining things  also there is a book called Drawing On The Right Side of The Brain by Betty Edwards which is about learning to draw through scientific skill-based lens (which is to say that art is a skill and learning to activate the right side of the brain with the proven methods in the book will help you learn) if you have access to a local library or can afford to buy it I highly recommend it, there is so much to see in the world and learning to draw helps you learn to see and it can make you feel super satisfied. I used to be catatonically depressed and am not any more and drawing definitely helps me stay out of that. Good luck!"
