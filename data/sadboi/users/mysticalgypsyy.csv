dogs,flijui3,t1_flij2ue,1585184075.0,Well you brought up money in the first sentence soo I figured you were planning to buy an expensive dog or something. Also this page ‚Äòdogs‚Äô I figured just had to do with generally all things dogs not just breeds buuuuut I‚Äôve had multiple dogs throughout my whole life and I‚Äôd say small dogs are def easier. Terriers need A LOT of exercise as they are high energy. I would try to get a puppy like around 1 year old to avoid any bad habits an older dog might already have. If you go with a super young one you‚Äôll have to get vaccines and neutering etc less vet trips when they are a bit older and all that is taken care of already. Good luck!
