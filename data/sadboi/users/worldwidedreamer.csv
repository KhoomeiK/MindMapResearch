insanepeoplefacebook,fq65x1z,t3_gh0623,1589125151.0,I would venture a guess and say this girl has previous bad encounters with men. I have as well and there was definitely a time in my late teens where I couldn't sort out who was malicious or not. Someone offering me something for free just to be nice... would have seemed implausible.
BPD,fl6rwiq,t1_fl5stnt,1584881402.0,"Oof. Yea especially during this coronavirus thing... My man has gone full old-fashioned ""i don't want you leaving the house without me."" Granted I am not happy feeling ""kept"" like this. So i rebel and cause chaos. But I'm definitely drawn to this type of man."
BPD,fjph1io,t1_fjozev5,1583550592.0,Holy shit. This can happen??
NarcissisticSpouses,f9i7w7z,t1_f9h0ev5,1575330419.0,If you read my post you will see that I already do see a therapist who believes I am being abused. You see one text thread that I posted because I didn't understand his perspective. You have literally no idea what I go through or what I've been through with him in the past. But thanks for your input.
NarcissisticSpouses,f8mdphd,t1_f8l3uh4,1574630429.0,My therapist doesn't believe I have BPD and stated she wouldnt feel comfortable for me to be diagnosed with anything because she feels my emotional instability could be coming from the emotional abuse he puts me through based on the various stories I've told her. Needless to say I'm very confused. Not sure if I'm being abused or if it's all me. He makes me feel that it is all in my head. As does the feedback on this post. But when i try to tell my therapist things she really pushes that I'm being abused and it's making me crazy.
NarcissisticSpouses,f8kjhs5,t1_f8ehxz7,1574611756.0,Do you have an advice on how to better communicate that I'm feeling emotionally neglected and abused? Because I feel he does a lot of these same things. He has repeatedly stated that I don't ask him how his day was. To me that seems petty but apparently it hurts him. Should he or I just not communicate these issues? Or is there some way to better communicate them. I hear what you're saying I really do. I want to fix the problem. I'm just not sure how.
NarcissisticSpouses,f8f8a8l,t1_f8ehxz7,1574539718.0,Thank you.
tooktoomuch,f8ducrv,t1_f8ck88z,1574509790.0,The pupils plus that telling jaw and the nystagmus.
tooktoomuch,f8dtulm,t1_f8dmt2e,1574509273.0,How though? Cause I hit the curb all the time in my car...
NarcissisticSpouses,f8bl0d1,t1_f8bhwbh,1574439359.0,"Thank you for your honest feedback. I completely agree that the whole thing is petty. However, I've been saying I feel like the whole relationship dynamic has changed and was trying to point out the things that are making me feel that way. The parts that feel like narcissism to me is that I never ever get an apology for anything that hurts my feelings. I get ""be accountable for your feelings."" ""You are responsible for your feelings."" And ""its not my fault you feel that way."" Every time I try to say something that bothers me I end up feeling so stupid. Whether its ""i really don't like that you order me around when we are grocery shopping."" Or ""it really hurt me when you said ___"" I feel like everything is always my fault."
NarcissisticSpouses,f8b22zv,t3_dzzxn9,1574423917.0,"Full disclosure: I have what I believe to be undiagnosed BPD. I am emotionally needy. A month ago he kicked me out saying he needed space and then immediately wanted me to come back. This fucked me up in the worst way. I didn't move back but I'm still trying to make it work with him. I keep expressing that I feel neglected and like he wants to spend time with anyone else other than me. He tells me it is in my head. So little things such as he no longer texts me goodnight or good morning feels like full confirmation for me. Now because I have mental instability my mind runs to ""if he's not going to give it to you. Get it elsewhere."" I don't want to so I'm trying to communicate my needs to the best of my ability without outright saying that. I feel saying that I need attention or I'll go elsewhere is manipulative so I tried to express myself without that. I feel like he's not wrong. That I do need to take accountability for my emotional reactions but this whole conversation just screams narcissism to me. 

I was raised in a narcissistic abuse childhood so I have fears that IM the narcissist and I'm putting it on him.  But when I try to look objectively. It doesn't seem that way ? Ugh. Idk. Feedback? Please."
tooktoomuch,f83fdt7,t1_f81m35m,1574210933.0,I've definitely definitely seen people look like that when they roll. When people are peaking on a high dose you might be rolling too and not realize that's how people look.
LadyBoners,f81i4r4,t1_f81a3lz,1574168166.0,Looked at your post history. Quite the transformation. Congrats!
tooktoomuch,f81hyvo,t3_dyfq83,1574168012.0,And now I want to try crack. Whole world is a rock concert.
Showerthoughts,f7s6jfn,t1_f7s56rz,1573991491.0,"How did he emotionally cheat? Noticing someone was hot while they got hit on? We are humans. You'll be a lot happier once you realize humans are messy and have complicated emotions. At the end of the day if they do the right thing anyway they deserve forgiveness for these ""imperfections."""
abusiverelationships,f7e1a0w,t1_f7dzr59,1573641386.0,I have to agree. Good for you for calling it as you see it instead of just validating OP.  According to this screenshot it appears she was mean -- and that does create insecurities in people. Not saying he doesn't have issues but both sides of this could use some work on communication.
stopdrinking,f6lkj4m,t1_f62jv1v,1572950199.0,It's hard. Like I said on another reply. I cut everyone from my life and got into two codependent relationships back to back. With those gone I just feel as if I have no one. It makes me feel desperate enough to hit up the people I KNOW are bad for me just to have someone to talk to.
stopdrinking,f6lkffv,t1_f65da0s,1572950040.0,"I have made it until today without drinking. My therapist is about to go on maternity leave and they stuck me with a therapist in the meantime who is a recovery specialist. She's been clean 34 years and does not subscribe to christianity. Which is HUGE for me because that's why I never clicked with meetings. 

Ask and you shall receive. Thank you beautiful people. I just feel so alone. I got sober 5.5 years ago and cut everyone i knew cause they were on drugs/drinking and got into a very codependent relationship. Now I find myself with no one and the temptation to hit up my old friends simply because I'm lonely. But they will only want to hang out if I'm still ""fun."""
StopSelfHarm,ex1zyc6,t1_ex1z3es,1565959881.0,Nope. It's too embarrassing to me. He tries to help me but maybe I'm just too much for him to handle so he gets mean because he doesn't know what to do.
StopSelfHarm,ewbdieg,t1_ewavu2g,1565264454.0,"Wow, that was really nice. Thank you, sincerely."
BPD,ew0u5n2,t3_clwokq,1565006190.0,My question is: is this normal? I feel like everyone might feel the pain as soon as they wake up and realize they still are in the same boat they were last night. The difference is other people much more easily get up and start the day. You can too. Just takes a little more intention.
abusiverelationships,ew0tvlv,t1_ew0svcb,1565005902.0,"Oh shit about the trauma bonding article I just read. I literally said to my boyfriend yesterday ""my face is breaking out in pimples more than I ever have in my life"" and I'm 28. Apparently the give and take - stress hormone and dopamine - cycle can cause that. 

Wow my relationship is toxic."
BPD,evrojrd,t3_ckswu4,1564713892.0,"So earlier tonight my best friend and I had a conversation about this because we realized we both feel this way. I said that I think people like us are drawn to the type of person that feels that everything is everyone else's fault. So us being mentally weak in this area fall victim to the mindset ""it's all me! Maybe it's always been me!"" Especially when they are able to point out obvious flaws in me. When in reality it's never ALL one person's fault I just can't always grasp that concept."
BPD,evoyg06,t1_evo1b8b,1564661603.0,"Well if you guys are familiar with drug use you will know that sometimes people just want to go balls to the walls with the chaos and self sabotage. I'm a recovering drug addict and sometimes I try to torch the relationship to go out and get fucked up to an extreme. Luckily my man is the same way and will usually call me out on it.

Unfortunately only you can decide what is best for YOU."
BPD,evnltq1,t3_ckhkpk,1564627405.0,"Oh. Wow. I think my boyfriend could have written this. 

Sometimes I feel very torn and I can not decide to leave or stay so I tend to keep my SO in limbo while I try to figure it out. A part of me always feels muffled dampened and changed by relationships. I don't like it. It's not that my SO is actively controlling me. But the relationship is. I cant just up and move to another state. I can't just jump in my car and drive a few states away for the weekend because I felt compelled to. It would raise some questions and the hassle isn't really worth it. But being settled causes me a lot of restlessness. However I also crave human to human contact to an extreme. I don't like being alone for extended periods of time. And I want to be able to text someone all day.  

Damn. I always feel so bad for the person that loves me."
lookatmydog,ev7vymj,t1_ev7n3lb,1564265139.0,It feels like everything. I can't even pinpoint it entirely. He's on hypoallergenic food and i dehydrate sweet potatoes for his treats. He can get a little crumb of something dropped on the floor and will be chewing on himself and ripping out his fur in no time.
NarcissisticSpouses,ev3zmyg,t1_ev2wizj,1564205194.0,Oh absolutely on the same page now. I was questioning this because my boyfriend says this to me all the time and it always feels insincere.
NarcissisticSpouses,ev2q2mz,t1_ev2ihtb,1564181700.0,Is this something you posted for someone specific to see?
NarcissisticSpouses,ev2hyvz,t3_ci4q2b,1564177226.0,"Can you please explain this to me? Do narcissistic spouses say things like ""I want you to be happy no matter what"" ?"
aww,eu4rep5,t3_cer2vu,1563461455.0,All of a sudden I feel like I am slighting my dog... usually I just give him a bull penis to chew on and call it a day.
