SuicideWatch,f3lypri,t3_dhb3r9,1570980869.0,"Aye you're gonna be feeling like shit for a week because you overloaded your brain with serotonin and typically dysphoria lasts about a week.
There have been studies though, that 5-htp can speed up recovery of serotonin production after taking mdma. I suggest looking in nto it and seeing if it helps you!"
Anxiety,f3f4t4o,t3_dgv8ly,1570889734.0,"Alcohol makes you feel calm because ethanol is a GABAergic drug that. It enhances your production of gamma aminobutyric acid which acts as  neurotransmitter which basically regulate calmness and what not. You could look more into it.  Other medications that work in the same way would be either benzodiazapines (Xanax, Ativan, valuim) or barbiturates (which are extremely dangerous.)  any substance that messes with GABA on that intense a level has a high risk of physical addiction as withdrawal from GABAergic substances can actually kill you. I do suggest trying something like valerian root or kava kava. Both of which are GABAergic but are much less intense in their effects than ethanol or benzodiazapines. Sounds like you might have anxiety. Try kava kava. Alcohol will only make things worse as your body adjusts to it.
Sorry for any mistakes"
