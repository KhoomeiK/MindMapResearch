southafrica,fr5ankz,t3_gmra8t,1589905400.0,"Schalk bezeidenout is defintly worth checking out. He plays in Kanarie. Furthermore an actress I recomend seeing is Simone Nortmann. She plays in Vir die Voels and Hotel toe name a few. I highly recomend Vir die Voels it is my favourite afrikaans movie. 

A film that has gained international recognition would be ""norm my skollie"". I havent seen it but it was nominated for some international awards.

As an afrikaans person I do find most of the movies we produce to be low budget or too comical. Some movies such as Vaselentjie are done well but also fall on the indy side of the spectrum. It's a gamble to find good afrikaans movies. 

Tsotsi is a brilliant movie that made me cry. It's a south african production that I believe won awards internationally."

Make overs are always fun because they're silly and you can just go wild. Listening to music and baking is also a great activity.  You can try recreational a mini masterchef or my kitchen rules by having you guys take turns preparing dinners and judging it like professionals! Hobbies could be sewing if you know how to or making macrame things(new personal favorite as it is inexpensive and looks stunning) I'd defintily suggest you two work on a drawing or painting together because then she can keep it as a keepsake of your time together. Furthermore since you live near the beach maybe try collecting seashells and sea glass and making jewellery out of it? This could be very fun and it would be a great reminder of the ocean. And a movie night is a definite must! Hope this helped x

Advice,fqynpm6,t3_glnu2y,1589751564.0,"Okay so this is what you do:

Set up a time table. Take a while day if you need to but do it. Work out your weeks or days before an exam heonyoure going to study and what you're going to study.
-downlaod quizlet and make small question packs and when you feel lazy but still want to study boom, go through them and I promise they're actually really beneficial.
-find a study buddy for accountability. Share timetables and plans and remind each other of the work. Tou can also meet up weekly or video call to talk about work. Even if you mess around and talk most of the time, just make sure you get some work done
-remind yourself constantly that even if you fail 3 times it will not be the end of the world. It will be a slight detour to your original plans but you will be okay.
- yes taking an exam is scary and I used to hate it too until I told myself that being scared of it wont help. Because as soon as I get in the room to write, I know the reaults are out of my hands. So that's why the night before I like to do soemthing relaxing liel watching a movie or taking a nice bath. Reminding myself that I am separate from the exam and not dependent on it if it makes sense?

Yes you should study and that's going to be step 1 in fixing your anxiety because if you're prepared then you can reassure your worries by saying you've done all you can. There is no greater feeling than saying that to yourself."

Things such as pilates really help me to understand that simpler excercises can really really tone muscles and help them grow strong. Yoga is also very nice to do.

The important thing to remember is you are exercising cor strength, stability and energy. Not for how you look. That's what I always remind myself. You're doing this because your body needs exercise to keep it healthy, not as a punishment.

But I am so glad I got to see it then. Because a year later when everyone started drawing the nazi symbol on desks thinking it's cool and making glass chamber jokes, I knew not to do that. I understood the context and effect those events had on the world, butbmroe importantly the Jewish people and all the other people persecuted during WW2.
