Over time I slowly but surely collected every book in the series and they got me through some tough times and made me feel better when I had no friends. I recently looked into buying the box set for nostalgia reasons and its over $400. I've moved so many times in between then and now that I'm sure they're either long gone or in bad condition due to storage. I guess in the long run $400 isn't a lot compared to other collectors items but the books to me are priceless and I wish I had paid more attention to where they were being stored!

When it feels real it’s sweet but it can become very apparent that it’s the only flattering thing a man knows how to say sometimes.

The way she talks to people is just awful and when she’s nice it’s not for the sake of being nice but so that she can pat herself on the back. When the reaction she gets isn’t what she expected, her go to line is “well that’s the last time I try to be nice, there’s just no reason to try anymore.” I feel bad for her husband but she’s rubbing off on her sister who used to be my friend.
