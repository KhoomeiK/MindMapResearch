AskReddit,fr5coy0,t3_gmlkr7,1589906380.0,"I cheated on my husband. It was a one time thing. I'd never slept with anyone else in my life and I wondered what it was like. As soon as it was done I realized I couldn't live with it and told him that same week. I admitted myself into a mental health facility to unpack my thoughts. I felt like the mental health hospital was like a vacation and I realized just how unhappy I was with my husband. I divorced him and never looked back. Cheating on him was wrong and I wish I hadn't done it but if I hadn't done it I wouldn't have realized how emotionally abusive he was or how unhappy and trapped I felt. It gave me the courage to leave him and find happiness. Now I'm in a good relationship. I don't have someone telling me things like, ""If you leave me your family will choose me over you,"" etc. etc. My ex husband also gave me a bowl of ""weed"" once and it was actually a bowl of purple sticky selvia and I had never tripped in my life. I think he broke my mind and it was shortly after this that I cheated. Sorry I'm rambling now..."
AmItheAsshole,fr59on7,t3_gml9rh,1589904930.0,My family use to bring my ex husband around and throw him in my face all the time. I hate seeing him and I don't care to hear about him. Sometimes family sucks. It's like they don't care that you're not together because they enjoyed having that person in their lives. That's fine and all but you shouldn't have to like it or be around it. I finally just told my family off and told them all the horrible things he had done to me to warrant my divorce even though it wasn't their business. It takes time but eventually your family will get over it and quit this charade. Sorry you have to deal with it.
