Suggest making sure you don't have any branded tanks. 
Try separate the tank from the battery so they don't hassle you about the battery.
Also let them know that this is something you've made yourself; if they ask how tell them you use a hair straightener to extract it. 
Doubt they'll ask questions that far. Hopefully they consider it an e-cig"
Anxiety,euwa6pw,t3_chl6gx,1564072833.0,Here's a big hug OP. There's many of us here who go through this. I hope it's an anxiety you can overcome.
CanadianMOMs,euw4pkb,t1_euvr3e0,1564070281.0,That's insane and also so practical. I really liked the guitar pick it comes with.
CanadianMOMs,euu39c2,t3_chaial,1564036494.0,"The Kannastor's are really good grinders. The replaceable kief mesh is a huge plus. The other fav is a Sharpstone, those things last forever."
CanadianMOMs,eusou0v,t1_eukr93r,1564011524.0,You're more than welcome OP.
CanadianMOMs,euirwin,t3_cgm666,1563853992.0,"Tinctures usually come in a liquid form and are usually in a alcohol or oil solution.
Isolate is usually pure CBD that has been extracted from a hemp source and is in a powdered form."
CanadianMOMs,euirgj1,t1_eui9xs7,1563853723.0,Yeah it would be harder to tell with vaping. Hope you don't have the same experience again man. I'd definitely question the curing and storage if so.
CanadianMOMs,eui4jul,t3_cgklhr,1563840267.0,"It's strange that a moist bud would dry down to a moldy product. 
Did they smoke fine intially or did they cause some irritation? Chances are they had spores within on delivery."
CanadianMOMs,eui44uu,t3_cgknkv,1563840028.0,"That's too bad. It's going to be like this for the foreseeable future, sadly the bigger a brand gets the bigger the chance of someone taking it down. As consumers we need to stand up for our rights"
CBD,euh4xnh,t3_cgdwpi,1563820883.0,"Good on you OP, it's never easy going full cold turkey on anything. Good luck with the new job and hope the CBD vapes work well for you."
