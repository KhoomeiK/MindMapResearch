I still cant look people in the eye, i keep my head down so i dont look at people to give them a creepy vibe. I dont bother talking to someone so i dont disappoint or creep someone out."

Its gotten to the point where i laugh instead of crying, subconsciously i know its a joke. I kept it inside for so long im not sure its worth talking about.

Im 22 with no aspirations in life, everything ive done ive felt im not good enough and i keep bashing myself down because thats all i know. I dont know how to be body positive or mentally positive, ive put myself down for so long its not worth to change. I know its not worth it to change, i just live in imagination to give a false perspective that im a hero or something that matters."

Yeah thats exactly what ive done. I sit alone in my room wanting to end this pathetic life because i cant muster up the courage for change, yet im prepared to buy a shotgun and drive alllll the way to see the Aurora borealis then put the gun to my head and pull the trigger. 

I dont know why i feel the need to type this out when i know it wont matter. Maybe i think itll help. Maybe it wont"
AskReddit,f8rh007,t3_ckf5gx,1574740162.0,"I cant think of any reasons to keep living. I know my friends, family, and pets will miss me but i wont. Ive only ever coasted through life and i have no future plans for myself. I refuse to have children because of family and personal issues, so i cant use ""future family"" as a reason to keep living.

Ive been wanting to use a shotgun and i have a ""dream location"" to do the deed, i told myself to wait until i hit 30 but recently i have knocked that number down to 25...

Though i find it funny that i dont want to talk to my friends about it because i know theyll guilt me into living and my family would shame me for it. What will the outcome be if i post this here?"
