BPD,fqiu27o,t3_gj4u8j,1589400894.0,"Same, I couldn’t see past 18 until I got there and now it’s 22."
BPD,fqitgg8,t3_gj1nob,1589400657.0,This! I’ve literally been having this feeling for year even when I am home. It’s an awful feeling because my home is where all of the pain is. I think it has to do with my bed and where I can be safe in my room.
BPD,fned416,t3_g16awa,1586887215.0,"I have so many issues with memories. There are entire years of my life gone and I don’t tend to remember suicide attempts or self harm or extreme emotion after they happen. 
I like to write significant things down in a diary when I remember them in case I forget them again. I also don’t want to dive too deep into my past because I don’t really want to know a lot of it."
BPD,fnecjhl,t3_g19fex,1586886926.0,"Hello! I’m so sorry for your loss. I’ve never had a pet for as long as 11 years so my advice might be a little stupid!
I always have a small ceremony, with music and photos and such. My animal’s have always been closer to me than any human has so it felt fitting to have a funeral.
I also make sure to let people know in a Instagram or Facebook post so that I don’t keep getting the ‘oh and how is Rainbow?’ and I have to explain again and again that she died.
Good luck with everything!"
BPD,fn2d9ok,t3_fyxnxv,1586585039.0,"You don’t sound too dramatic. It’s an important part of a relationship.
If it were me I would try and talk to my partner about the issues I’m having with the relationship (but I also know I’d be way to nervous to actually do so)
Good luck !
(Also I’m going to sound really stupid but what is FP?)"
BPD,fn2cz4d,t3_fyuxau,1586584770.0,"Hello! Hope you are feeling a little better now. If not I understand.

I’ve had several relapses one after three years clean. It always feels awful to have to start again but I know you can do it. It doesn’t matter when you start your clean streak again or the amount of time it just matters that you aren’t self harming anymore.
Good luck!!"
BPD,fn2c8cn,t3_fyww5m,1586584095.0,"Hey, hope you’ve kept from doing so. DM me if you still need help"
BPD,fn2c68a,t3_fyx2xh,1586584041.0,"It’s a difficult line with mental illness and disabilities. The government (of my country at least) is very hesitant to call it as such. I mean I count as disabled for a different issue I have so I might not be the best person to talk about it.
Although BPD most often ticks all the boxes for a disability. I think it’s different in every country."
BPD,fmy5h83,t3_fy425z,1586478538.0,It took me forever to realise I wasn’t normal. I knew I was different or ‘special’ as the teachers liked to put it. My (tw) self-harm and sucide attempts/ ideation never felt real because they were all happening alone. Finally I told a friend and she freaked out. This was when I was 13 or 14. She didn’t really want to be my friend after that.
BPD,fmy4b10,t3_fxxgpq,1586477821.0,"That sounds awful, I hope you find a path through! Your GPA is amazing and this post is very eloquently written. It shows your intellect and that can’t be taken away from you.

Good luck and feel free to delete this response if it makes no sense"
BPD,fmy3aua,t3_fy0w80,1586477210.0,"I’m 19F with the same issue. I’m unfortunate enough to still be stuck in school due to years out for illness. I have similar issues (I assume - you can tell me if we’re completely different lol) I went to hairdressing school and many other schools for a couple of months. They were all non paying schools - thank God or my bills would be so high. I also find it so difficult to stick to a hobby or a friendship.
I think the first step is realisation of this fact and then to really think about what you enjoy. Is there anything you have been able to commit too?"
BPD,fmwnsez,t3_fxvjo4,1586449874.0,I think I’ve gone off the rails. I feel so much emotion at all times and I don’t want it.
