* don't let let them get cold cause they will be hard to warm up. I put my hands in a sink full of warm water for 5 minutes then straight into liner gloves before leaving the house

* chemical hand warmers work okay, but can get pricey

* making fists and squeezing seems to help stave off frost nip when out and about in cold weather.

* northface etip gloves have been my go to liner/light gloves. The material is a hybrid of sorts. Kinda like wetsuit material but way more subtle and flexible. Ive used them down to -10 with good results.

As a testament to how much I love these headphones, I figured they lasted me 4 years of daily use, I'll buy another pair, and for the price it's hard to justify much else.

So yeah the new pair I got is the matte grey. The grey is a bit light for me but it's very nice uniform color on everything. Very low poly render feel. [Photo ](https://i.imgur.com/zYKws7j.jpg)

The only real complaint with the new ones is the black     vinyl pad is staring to deteroiate, this could however been from me badly storing them. I've had them for about 3 years."
