My mom and dad were in a store. They were shopping and my mom and dad got separated. All of a sudden my dad pops around the corner in front of my mom and says ""Lets go. We're leaving. There's a guy following you."" She turned around and this guy starts hiding his face. They go out to the parking lot and my dad says ""Get in."" And the guy had followed them both outside and he was standing at the entrance of the store. Good thing my mom was carrying a .380 and my dad a 45."

Darling, I'm the last of a dying breed. 

I may not take time to sit down and read, but I will work my fingers to bone to provide what you need. 

I will hold open doors and rub your feet. Many men don't show chivalry.

Nothing will keep us apart, land, air or sea. Not even your worst enemy.

astrophysics,ff24my8,t3_eqvvqc,1579493681.0,"Well here's my theory. What if you launched an object at light speed into a black hole. Theoretically for an object to survive light speed it would have to constantly expand. A black hole causes spaghettification which stretches objects. Could these possibly cancel each other out? I've done some calculations but I'm not sure if they're correct. The Gforce would make the object implode at a whopping (estimated) 30,591,067.142857 Gs or newtons of force. However a black holes gravitational pull would produce 6e+43 which is 6 times 10 to the 16th power. (That is, multiplied by 10 16 times.) Any geniuses here want to help prove or disprove my theory?"
