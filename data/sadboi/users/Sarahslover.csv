I trusted my kid and then found out she was going into chat rooms and giving out her phone # and chatting with people at 4 am. She had no idea who they were and if they were really a kid. At 4 am, not likely.  This wasn't the first time.

It's a safety issue. My kids have privacy as long as they respect the privilege and deserve it. Once they do something stupid they lose that privlege.  

Most parents aren't mean and snoopy to be controlling assholes, it's because kids make bad decisions and do stupid things. My job is to keep them safe above all else and help them be smart enough to navigate the real world on their own and adults. Not to be their friend."
