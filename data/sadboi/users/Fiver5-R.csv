I wonder what the odds are that one of the people responding to this lives near me though. I've moved so many times and I've had to completely change my social network because I was unaware of a lot of bad things going on that someone healthy helped me figure change for myself...but I'm in that in-between of ""I know exactly what I should look for and desire in friendships"" and actually finding people that fit the bill. I wish everyone here the best of luck, and for the record, I would be friends with most of you!!"

I try to take away the positive, that I'm not alone, but I can sometimes feel frustrated and like I'm not totally a person; like parts of my personality are just byproducts of what I went through.

Looking at phrases like ""lifelong journey/struggle/fight""(a matter of perspective like everything else with this I suppose) can make me anxious and frustrated that even though I'm making progress, this is never truly going to be over. And all the little complexities of it, like being aware of my triggers and learning new coping strategies, etc...it feels like a full time job I don't have the time for. I guess I equate it to suddenly finding out you have a lifelong illness that affects every interpersonal relationship and activity you engage in. And it frustrates me to think about.

I don't mean to sound pessimistic, either. I've made leaps and bounds in my personal navigation through CPTSD. It's just that the more deeply ingrained I realize it is, it can be scary as I peel back the layers. I remind myself that my trauma is not me. And everything I learn I can apply to helping cope with my symptoms. Ultimately, knowledge is a big step towards healing. 

Don't be afraid to reach out if you're feeling anxious. (Sorry for the tl;dr)"

I typically don't project my voice very loudly, but then I'll notice I'm raising it because I can't hear well above the pitch. It can be anywhere from a really high pitch like when I hear the TV, to something lower and more akin to a tuning fork. I've never had my hearing tested but I've had it suggested...I just live with it, tbh."
earrumblersassemble,etiss8o,t3_cbsuce,1562859012.0,"Okay so this post basically describes me but also I've had some hearing damage and now I seem to have lost what was once control, so to speak, over this muscle. I get this anticipatory reflex whenever I think a loud sound is coming, something is going to hit me/I flinch, etc. But it is extreme...sometimes even someone just changing the volume of their voice a bit can start that muscle ""cringing"" constantly for a good several minutes. 

It might be worth mentioning that I have CPTSD (complex post-traumatic stress disorder) and noticed this symptom around the time I sought help and was diagnosed. I always thought everyone dealt with this, I only wanted to know why I didn't have control any more. Perhaps it is tied in to the general hyper arousal of my nervous system? 

If anyone has any ideas or tips on how I can ""stop"" it from clenching involuntarily though, I would be super excited and grateful."
