SuicideWatch,fduf2qd,t1_fdc38rk,1578732168.0,"This about how sad it makes you feel when you think about even just saying suicide to the people that love you. Now think about how sad they would be if you did something like that. Coming from someone who has recently lost her best friend quite shockingly to suicide, I wish she reached out, I wish she asked for help, I wish she tried to explain her pain. Because nothing is more of a burden than the weight I will carry now that I’ve lost her. Be strong and please do talk to someone at least. You are worth it ."
