I have a significant other, family, and close friends. They get to know that information about me. Not everyone else *needs* to know, and I need to resist the urge to be loud about every single aspect of my life.

I try to think of my career as another partner. You‚Äôre not bound to a partner forever. You can ‚Äúbreak up‚Äù with a career path. But you also shouldn‚Äôt leave as soon as that passion starts to subside a little. Work hard. Watch videos of people already in the career on YouTube, try to make friends in your major, talk to professors, join subreddits related. Write down all the things that first inspired you to chase that career. Make an effort with psychology just like you would with a significant other. If it doesn‚Äôt work out, have a ‚Äútalk‚Äù with it. Sit down and WRITE OUT why it isn‚Äôt working. What changed. Why isn‚Äôt it a good fit anymore. If you can come back to that list and objectively see valid points, and you still feel the same‚Äîthen choosing something else will probably be a good fit. 

I‚Äôve changed twice since beginning college and I am currently super happy what what I‚Äôve chosen. Sometimes I get that little pull, but when I write things out I realize that I do still have passion for the future I‚Äôve chosen."
BPD,fp2cbru,t3_gadzsv,1588259259.0,"Oh honey no... 

1. Listen. I have--and live with a parent who has BPD. We struggle/have struggled with things like you mentioned. With me, pointless lies. For my parent, paranoia that is pushed onto others + becomes disruptive. THESE ARE NOT OUR BPD BUT UNHEALTHY COPING MECHANISMS THAT \*WE\* HAVE TO WORK TO CHANGE. Symptoms of BPD include anxiety, cycles of impulsive choices... I used to lie a ton because I was always anxious that whatever I had to say would not be good enough. The anxiety was BPD but the lies were a choice. They became so second-nature that I'd just blurt things out. Wasn't BPD, though. Was a bad habit that came from my BPD symptom. It's the same with the paranoia. Anxiety and fear. Barring your children from attending birthday parties or eating anything not cooked at home is a choice. 
2. ""woo bpd amirtie a im a spaz n i want to die"" ... it sounds like you are very young and just need to work on yourself. MANY people in middle-high school struggle with anxiety, white lies, body issues, bad choices... choosing to misrepresent BPD because you're an angsty teen is not the move. I am SO glad I didn't know I had BPD when I was in high school because I feel I would've used it as a crutch and not an ""oh, this is why I am and I can use this information to better myself."""
BPD,fp2ba55,t3_gaoaxf,1588258715.0,"Oh, so many people need to hear this--ESPECIALLY teen girls with toxic attitudes who watch Scott Pilgrim vs. The World and decide they must have BPD. Cycles of over-attachment and withdrawal are a symptom. Not leading people on and then dropping them. Internalizing things is s symptom. Not 1-Upping all your friends' woes because you ""have it worse."" 

I've lived my entire life in fear of hurting other people. I know I still have, but it pains me. I'm frequently quoted saying that I'd rather chop off my right arm than make someone feel bad about themselves. ENJOYING seeing others suffer or making it a quirky part of yourself is a whole different mental/emotional issue you need to sort out. It isn't BPD."

servicedogs,fnlg79y,t1_fnlf7ol,1587052992.0,"This hasn‚Äôt been an issue at work, though, because I‚Äôm never solely ‚Äúin charge‚Äù and always have someone in the same building I can go seek help from if needed.

The ‚Äúimaginary‚Äù or perceived stressors."

I have a skewed perception of self and I feel incredibly watched and judged when I‚Äôm not with someone‚Äîusually I‚Äôll take my sister but honestly I have a stuffed dog I take in my bag and have on my lap / next to me / in the bag against my leg in college lectures, driving, sitting at home etc. I get judged for that sometimes and while I do feel badly about it, it‚Äôs way more manageable than the anxiety I feel from not having a possible support if something triggers me."
