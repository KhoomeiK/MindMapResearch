In a world where we’re encouraged to share publicly each aspect of our lives, we often get vulnerability confused with being an open person. Most folks are set in their ways, and sharing my controversial opinions might get me “clout” with a small group of people, but it isn’t worth isolating others. I have a significant other, family, and close friends. They get to know that information about me. Not everyone else *needs* to know, and I need to resist the urge to be loud about every single aspect of my life. I’d rather people know me as someone who is kind and will help them when they need it than think of my beliefs, hobbies, politics, etc. and think for a second that I wouldn’t help them or provide a listening ear just because we are different."

BPD,fp4n683,t1_fp3f7rd,1588302728.0,"I was (mis)diagnosed with MDD because I constantly wanted to “die”— but had no suicidal urges. I just wished I’d never been born.

messianic,fp3n5vg,t3_g9x7kj,1588282259.0,"If you read in Galatians 3, you will see that there is no longer a distinction between Jew and Gentile. We are ALL one in Messiah if you choose to follow God’s law. I like to tell my Christian friends as they come to Torah that I’m as Christian as they are and they’re as Jewish as I am :) Some definitely disagree with this sentiment, but Romans 11:11-31 has some good words indicating that anyone who follows the Messiah is now grafted in. So yes—you could be Messianic. Labels are less important than following Torah and going where the Holy Spirit leads you in your walk."
BPD,fp2duu3,t3_gaxi8y,1588260044.0," I see this discussed a lot in regards to relationships but not as much with careers, so I’ll tell you what I did as I worked through DBT. 

I try to think of my career as another partner. You’re not bound to a partner forever. You can “break up” with a career path. But you also shouldn’t leave as soon as that passion starts to subside a little. Work hard. Watch videos of people already in the career on YouTube, try to make friends in your major, talk to professors, join subreddits related. Write down all the things that first inspired you to chase that career. Make an effort with psychology just like you would with a significant other. If it doesn’t work out, have a “talk” with it. Sit down and WRITE OUT why it isn’t working. What changed. Why isn’t it a good fit anymore. If you can come back to that list and objectively see valid points, and you still feel the same—then choosing something else will probably be a good fit. 

I’ve changed twice since beginning college and I am currently super happy what what I’ve chosen. Sometimes I get that little pull, but when I write things out I realize that I do still have passion for the future I’ve chosen."
BPD,fp2cbru,t3_gadzsv,1588259259.0,"Oh honey no... 

1. Listen. I have--and live with a parent who has BPD. We struggle/have struggled with things like you mentioned. With me, pointless lies. For my parent, paranoia that is pushed onto others + becomes disruptive. THESE ARE NOT OUR BPD BUT UNHEALTHY COPING MECHANISMS THAT \*WE\* HAVE TO WORK TO CHANGE. Symptoms of BPD include anxiety, cycles of impulsive choices... I used to lie a ton because I was always anxious that whatever I had to say would not be good enough. The anxiety was BPD but the lies were a choice. They became so second-nature that I'd just blurt things out. Wasn't BPD, though. Was a bad habit that came from my BPD symptom. It's the same with the paranoia. Anxiety and fear. Barring your children from attending birthday parties or eating anything not cooked at home is a choice. 
2. ""woo bpd amirtie a im a spaz n i want to die"" ... it sounds like you are very young and just need to work on yourself. MANY people in middle-high school struggle with anxiety, white lies, body issues, bad choices... choosing to misrepresent BPD because you're an angsty teen is not the move. I am SO glad I didn't know I had BPD when I was in high school because I feel I would've used it as a crutch and not an ""oh, this is why I am and I can use this information to better myself."""
BPD,fp2ba55,t3_gaoaxf,1588258715.0,"Oh, so many people need to hear this--ESPECIALLY teen girls with toxic attitudes who watch Scott Pilgrim vs. The World and decide they must have BPD. Cycles of over-attachment and withdrawal are a symptom. Not leading people on and then dropping them. Internalizing things is s symptom. Not 1-Upping all your friends' woes because you ""have it worse."" 

I've lived my entire life in fear of hurting other people. I know I still have, but it pains me. I'm frequently quoted saying that I'd rather chop off my right arm than make someone feel bad about themselves. ENJOYING seeing others suffer or making it a quirky part of yourself is a whole different mental/emotional issue you need to sort out. It isn't BPD."

Practicing mindfulness with the “take every thought captive” mindset helped me to do things, from big tasks like getting into a competitive post-grad program to little ones like just having a conversation with my boyfriend. I do have to take a minute or three before I begin tasks to slowly look at each distraction in my mind and put them to rest, but my mind is so much more clear! A lot of times I’ll make charts where I write out each mental block and tackle a response to each one before I begin—it helps me with clarity a ton!"
DecidingToBeBetter,fo3s8vt,t1_fo3rt6p,1587492102.0,"In a way, yes. I think mindfulness is key to stopping procrastination because when you just meditate, you’re only quieting your mind. Mindfulness is that extra step where you work to become aware of what stops you. I think a better way to phrase how it impacts my life rather than “don’t think, just do it” would be “think only as much as you need, and don’t reflect until you’ve finished.” I think so much of what stopped me personally from getting things done is that I would think an idea into the ground and never make a single step towards it. Reflection can only come after you’ve completed (or at least started) a task."

I got into DBT a few months out, and realized I was splitting, so I wasn’t really able to recognized that I may just be missing having an fp. I committed to staying out of relationships for a while and when I started considering one again, I made lists of what attracted me to these people and their traits, whether they would work for what I was looking for or whether it was just me wanting someone to show affection to. Those lists really helped me stay rational about relationships and I ended up feeling less empty about connections because I became more selective."
