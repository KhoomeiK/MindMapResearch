capricorns,fjcazqa,t3_fcpr7v,1583213681.0,My ex was a leo like that. It honestly was a source of many fights as time went on. Felt like he wasn't respecting my time and honoring to tell me advance to make other plans. Hes very self absorbed. He got better at it after a year but he has a huge pattern of only thinking of himself and whats gunna satisfy him.  He had a hard time going beyond that. Actually dated 3 leos like that. They were also huge flirts with a bunch of other girls behind my back which sucked too and they're egos are kinda inflated they dont tale any form of critism well which ultimately just never worked for me because im always trying to better myself and give respect and didnt feel any return or being on my level in that way.

pregnant,fj7ygq7,t1_fj7s61v,1583101062.0,Yeah i would agree he has been recently. The law doesnt really work that way though. He can be abusive to me and it doesnt mean he looses rights to his kid. And he really doesnt give them up just for kicking me out. He has rights if he asks for them. I can only voice my concerns. He doesnt know where I am so I dont see a point in getting one against him.

pregnant,fj763uc,t1_fj71idg,1583087065.0,I mean no i definitely am bringing up that in court if he petitions for custody because yes I am scared of him being alone with the baby if he freaked out this much from me saying I wanted to keep the baby. I'm not sure why he thinks that. Maybe someone is harassing him that I don't know? Maybe it is mental illness? I dont know because i wasnt given enough information.

heartbreak,fi7z3qu,t1_fi7sjqo,1582230544.0,You cant rely on someone for your sobriety though. He would want you to stay sober even if not together. And when you use you're creating great negative patterns for more misery. Don't add to whatever is already hard. I have done this before and then gone through years of misery and bad patterns all because i choose not to face my feelings sober. It doesn't help in the long run. It might feel good for today or the week but its actually going to give you more heartache.

dating_advice,fhf6k2r,t1_fhf6166,1581537245.0,How many people do you know were in a relationship before sleeping together? Thats what I mean by hook up culture. You usually hangout and hook up and then it develops into something.
dating_advice,fhf6en1,t1_fhf5ml9,1581537157.0,"I've seen it. I consider myself a very sexual woman and i still see the need is more real for men. They are always on the look out more than me and I'm very sexual compared to alot of women.

I think many could but they want that one girl enough that they dont. Its a lot easier not to have to answer to someone and have your freedom and do whatever you want. Its pros and cons.

Certain people have higher standards. Youre still completely generalizing. Ive told you how both men and women have dumped me over dumb shit and now youre replying that women have higher standards. Then those men do too! This is my fucking point. Generalizations are absolutely ludacris and its far too complicated of a subject to boil down. 

Unless someone is married and sometimes even then they are going to keep their options open. Man woman. Gay straight. Whatever."
dating_advice,fhf5usa,t1_fhf52c9,1581536841.0,"Yeah but we live in hook up culture. Any option is always an option for something now a days. Its not even about a relationship or not. I just think people like having any options incase it doesnt work out with someone. But some people still just deny people and then complain no one wants them. Like i see these 5 girls here and you just not interested in them. They have options they just dont want them. Which is totally natural.

I still think its juggling. If you got your energy with many people wether they actually like you back or not you're trying to have more than one option. The context I was implying the girls did like them back they just werent a first choice so they kept it alive by watering the plant behind whoever was their first choice."
dating_advice,fhf5awx,t1_fhf4t98,1581536521.0,"They also want to. They are more likely to try everything because their need to have sex is higher. 

A lot of men I've met are like this. And they usually straight up tell me because im bi they think im one of the dudes. I dont think most men would choose to be in a relationship. They would prefer not but if they like someone enough they do it. 

Youre making assumptions. Ive been dumped by chicks for the dumbest shit ever. It's just the way of the world. I would love to have someone who wants me no matter what and isnt questioning if its right but that just doesnt happen and/or takes a long time to develop. That most people dont limit themselves even within a relationship completely until its gotten super serious and been a couple years. I'm always all in but thats a whole another story."
dating_advice,fhf4qwq,t1_fhf48r0,1581536194.0,"No. Ive seen both men and women. Do their dating app and complain how no one likes them. What they actually mean is no one likes them that they like back. Men are more likely to be like i wouldnt date her but I'll do dirty with her but ive even see guys be like nah. 

Talking but flirting. Implying more. Getting emotionally reassurance or fulfillment from someone else all the way to having sex with them."
dating_advice,fhf4gc7,t1_fhf3zqu,1581536022.0,"Yeah but men shoot their shots at everything. I'm a woman and got denied tons of times too. I think its an extreme generalization. Everyone struggles in the game of love and attraction but most people learn the game. 

Theres plenty of men who are in relationships and want out and hate commitment. They're like yeah i care for her but I rather fuck whoever I want. I've had dudes dump me over the dumbest shit ever. Ive seen chicks do the same. And I've seen the opposite but the majority of people arent happy or not playing the game or they would all be married."
dating_advice,fhf3qvv,t1_fhf292d,1581535606.0,I've sat and did online dating with people who complain about not having options. And they sit there and deny people. Theres always someone who likes somebody. With the internet makes it even easier. Everyone just still has their own tastes but again I think most people hate themselves they will take any attention and no reservation on talking to more than one person.
