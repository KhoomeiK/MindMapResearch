There isnt any school for classes nearby (8 hours drive ONE WAY), but I there are plenty of farmers so I assume it would be possible to get someone to come to our farm for private lessons.

Okey so ideally more than one! Maybe someone else wants to pay a little to have their horse go there, I dont know the marked or interests for that to be honest. 



With regards to fencing we got over 50 acres so a solid fence will cost a fortune, can't really put that kind of money down. Also due to agriculture law we can't leave the 50 acres unused so it has to be used for some kind of agriculture purpose, having horses or other animals there for pasture counts as such a use. Another thing with the fence is that we get a lot of snow in the winter so the fence needs to be able to handle that. The light electric fence i figure i can pull the stakes up in the winter and place them in the snow so its higher up. (If you got a 100 cm tall fence and there suddenly comes 60 cm of hard snow then your fence is only 40 cm.....) 


I have no idea how many animals we need to keep 50 acres maintained though (not overgrow).??


With regards to feed and that stuff as I said we have over 50 acrees of field with grass. Horse type we are looking at icelandic horses, which I understand is really pony-sized even though they are called horses, so I assume they require less food and also produce less manure!"

I know it's a common saying, I know its a lot of shitty magazines that writes it, but it is plain wrong. If you have a untreated condition like low thyroid levels you might require only 2000 calories a day rather than 2500 calories a day, and that can obviously impact your weight. However as long as you eat less than 2000 calories a day - which then is your calorie need - you will lose weight.

Calculating calories can be hard though, and many people do it wrong. Most common mistakes are:

1: Forgetting calories in drinks

2: Looking at calories in portion size rather than by grams. A 100 gram chocolate bars has about 550 kcal. That means 550 kcal each 100 gram. The chocolate producer however does not want you to know how fat you get by eating 100 grams, so he writes  on the front 137 kcal each portion. The thing is, the assholes has defined 1 portion as 1/4th of the 100 gram chocolate bar. And nobody buys 100 grams of chocolate and eats 1/4th. A ton of products do this. So look at kcal for each 100 gram, and calculate.

If you can not be bothered with calories or calculations, for the next 2 weeks eat exactly the same as before, no changes - but cut every portion size in 2. Breakfast usually 4 pieces of bread with nutella? Well now its 2 pieces etc. Do this and you will lose weight quickly."

Exercise is hard when your obese, risk of injury is greater and it's not important to lose weight (contrary to popular belief).

I'm guessing you cant get it as low as the store bought ones that are virtually without any fat at all but I might be wrong. Come to think of it its kinda crazy how much of this seemingly basic knowledge is lost in our modern society. I enjoy learning it tho."

medicalschool,flcp2yw,t3_fnv8nb,1585040241.0,The good thing about not getting PPE is that it is much easier to tell your admin to fuck himself and run out of the hospital without a big ass gown and p95 mask.

Fire me from the position, I do no care, they need me more than I need them. Give me a licence warning, I do not care. Something inside me just lights up when they try to force shit like this on us, I'd rather burn down my whole future than give them the satisfaction. Fuck them."

norge,fl3hgnw,t3_flzpao,1584784151.0,"Det er blitt så sykt innarbeidet i hodet på nordmenn at sykepleiere tjener forferdelig og leger alt for mye. Hvert år sammenlignes lønnen til en selvstendig næringsdrivende legespesialist (fastlege fra skattelistene) som i snitt jobber over 60 timers uke, med grunnlønnen til en sykepleier. 


Som nyutdannet lege hadde jeg lavere lønn enn min nyutdannede sykepleier samboer. Hun jobbet riktig nok privat, men som lege har du ikke det valget før ca 10 år etter en sykepleier (lengre utdanning pluss du må fullføre spesialisering i det offentlige). 


Syns selvfølgelig vi alle fortjener langt bedre lønn, men sykepleiere er på ingen måte i noen særstilling. Er vel knapt noen bachelor utdanninger som er garantert en lønn på minst 500 tusen hvor som helst i Norge på dagen om du jobber som privat utleid vikar."
norge,fl0l5o4,t1_fl0h250,1584709641.0,Problemet er at vi har så mye byråkrati at det er antagelig for seint før sykehuset deler det ut. Men i prinsippet enig med deg.

Forøvrig ville jeg uansett ikke skrevet ut medisiner til meg selv som ikke har klar evidens, men til syvende og sist er det forskrivende lege sitt ansvar og vurdering. Eventuelle reaksjoner fra helsetilsynet hvis dette blir et stort problem vil komme i etterkant. Vi skal være glad det ikke skal en byråkratisk prosess til i forkant av at en lege kan skrive ut medisiner til seg selv (husk at leger skriver resepter til seg selv for bruk i egen praksis, - det vil si til pasienter de behandler privat. Feks samtlige fastleger med privat praksis (90% eller noe sånt)."

I det øyeblikket jeg går tom for maske og annet beskyttelsesutstyr så drar jeg hjem fra jobb. Mange av disse folka gjør ikke det. Det fortjener respekt.
