How can the West get China to follow their example and take more steps to reduce emissions? 

With the US keeping emissions *nearly* flat since 1970 and the EU emissions decreasing, while population and manufacturing output soared, maybe China could learn from the emissions control progress the West already made? Why not use that progress as a positive example that need to continue everywhere?

While the West continues replacing fossil fuels?

It seems like it's a good opportunity to recognize and reinforce progress -- while encouraging the current source of the soaring emissions to put laws and technologies in place that helped others make progress?

Thanks for a thoughtful and considerate note.

I stayed sober from pot 32 years and worked the program and no meaningful change in depression. Losing a beloved daughter to a false allegation of sexual abuse and making a major (in my tide pool) discovery that disrupted powerful interests in part of the Ag sector were triggers that made my mood far worse.

(Imagine you somehow found a hypothetical easy way to simply choose a different drug than you do now-- and you could reduce depression by up to 50 percent. And you discovered this by accident.  That kind of disruption, but in the relatively small niche I'm taking about.)

I meant that mix of emotions kind of the same way the weather is fine -- or killing people -- depending on where you look on the planet.  

They are paying me millions of dollars to implement a discovery that can feed a lot more people with the same amount of crops. It is extremely complex politically and I have to keep track of 500 hours of workflow every month.  I can't afford any risk of memory loss.

Mechanically everything is fine. Work is growing.  Good relationships. But I am ultimately alone, in a world where there is not enough 'truth' left to really matter, and it's really not an ok place. I dislike what I see enough to want out before the government, media and the sheep on all sides of the narratives finally make the system collapse.

After all, we are a species which ran out of toilet paper for a respiratory virus. How can anyone who can see be expected to feel ok?

P.S. I would generally rather have a physician who is a friend who sees me over time and knows what's actually happening with me -- than one who I see for 20 minutes a year or a psychiatrist I see 20 minutes a month. But I don't see him as replacing a psychiatrist or any other specialist with advanced training in their field.  Can a friend with a medical degree possibly see things a 20-minute visit would miss?  Honest question, not an argument.  I get the importance of impartiality but I wonder about the value of having more facts over time too."

If I could change the whole world I wouldn't start with something else, important as that issue truly is. I would want to start with changing minds about a few other things first, and work my way up to the global food system."
news,fne94lr,t1_fne2dtl,1586885224.0,"I'm familiar with that viewpoint. Just yesterday a city Facebook friend suggested everyone raise their own food. In farming, the primary focus is on producing enough food, as inexpensive and safe as possible. 

It's easy to find fault with anything, but the diverse food system with so many wonderful food choices has served society very well. Most people do not want others telling them what they can eat, and meat production has a long history of social acceptance in most cultures. People who are not directly involved with farming and the highly complex food system continually suggest ideas to completely overhaul global agriculture. Some of these ideas work great at a small scale, but they haven't been applied widely because they don't actually work widely. 

There are also tradeoffs to consider. Here's an NPR story on what would happen if everyone ate just the recommended servings of fruits and vegetables:  https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2019/07/17/742670701/if-we-all-ate-enough-fruits-and-vegetables-thered-be-big-shortages 

While profits are important, it's simply not true that it's all about profits. But without profit no business isn't sustainable.

The easiest and cheapest way to save lives from heart disease is to fight smoking and obesity, not retool the global food production system. The easiest food system efficiency gain is to find a way not to waste 30 percent of the food we produce."

The real issue is if this trend spreads to other food companies.  Then there will be a very unpleasant chain reaction.

Coronavirus,fncpsqd,t1_fn89xuv,1586843336.0,"For what it's worth there is a chance your soy consumption is increasing your disease resistance. Particularly, respiratory diseases.

That's not proven but here's why I think that: For a number of years livestock operations and researchers have noticed a link between more soy being used in pig feed and less disease problems. Pig and human physiology is similar.  This has not been studied enough for industry make firm claims about the effects in animals, but the research showing a positive effect is increasing.

I don't know if you can eat enough soy for any possible effect to matter, but I thought you might find the early research buzz interesting as a vegetarian."

I was about 12, sitting on the ground, gently petting Thor, a Norwegian elkhound that was visiting the neighbors. Without warning I heard a short growl and the next thing I knew, the dog had my face in its teeth. He let go immediately, but I was pouring blood down my shirt. At that moment the owner looked over the fence and saw me with a noticeable coating of blood. I got a bunch of stitches.  

When I asked dad later where Thor went, he said ""Valhalla."""
