A lot of people ask this question, and I‚Äôve been at both. I‚Äôve decided to give a thorough reply and explain the differences.  But before I start, I have to stress out that both events are amazing, and whichever you end up going, you will most definitely love it.

There are multiple Time Warp and Awakenings events. 

This post is about my experience at Time Warp in Mannheim, Germany, which takes place during the first week of April and the Awakenings Festival in Spaarnwoude, Velsen-Zuid, the Netherlands
which is half an hour away from Amsterdam and it usually takes place during the end of June.

 You can get to the both venues on buses going from the city, and probably that‚Äôs the best way to get to the venue. 

Time warp Mannheim starts in the evening and lasts until 2-3 pm the next day. Because of the intensity, the energy is more condensed. The energy of Awakenings is fantastic as well, but it‚Äôs spread it out into two days. It starts at noon and ends at the end of the day. So you have to either go back to the city and continue partying in Amsterdam where multiple parties are taking place during the night and continue to Awakenings when they open the doors next morning or take a rest, sleep and continue the next day. 

The format is a bit different, as well. At Timewarp, all the events are taking place in closed stages, and because of that, there is a strong accent on visuals. 

If you are into light and visuals, time warp is the mecca!

Awakening has its secret weapon as well. Open-air stages are allowing visitors to enjoy the day party vibe, which is very relaxing. 

Another thing to pay attention to is the lineup. You will find most of the top techno artists at both events, and many of them will overlap, but there will be artists who will be at one event or another. 

The most significant advantage of attending these events is a chance to see so many amazing artists in one place. Some Artists do not tour or attend a lot of festivals. They mainly play at their resident clubs. 

I hope this post was helpful. 

If you went to any of these please add your advice and recommendation in the comments."
