It's up to you if you want to divulge that you have bipolar. That being said, if you tell someone and they judge you or dismiss you or stop talking to you, it's for the better. They don't deserve to be in your life. Look at it this way, if they were in your shoes and you came to you, you'd still be there for them."

I can't imagine having a serial killer for a family member either. My grandfather was a drug dealer & was crazy. He shot one guy in the foot. He shot & killed a guy through a door. I believe it was over drugs but it was considered self-defense. He ended up being murdered in his sleep a few years back by his gf. That was a hard blow.

I'm just saying there's a strong correlation between tic disorders and mental illnesses (mostly ADHD). That's not saying everyone with tics has a mental illness or that people with mental illness have tics.

20% of children with ADHD will develop a tic disorder.

The first link below says, ""impulsive actions in ADHD and tics may suggest a neural circuity disinhibition or release, of undesired patterns of behavior linked to emotion, sensation, movement, and cognition"". 

My bad on the autism part. Maybe I mis-worded my original post. I'm just saying there's a strong correlation between the two. It was obvious Shaw had tics. But mental illness doesn't explain murder anyway. I have bipolar, ADHD, social anxiety, & PTSD. I haven't killed anyone yet. Yet. Jk, jk. But the OP asked if anyone thought he had a mental illness.

I think you're going through the guilt you feel after a manic episode. It's not fun but you have to give yourself some credit. Remind yourself you wouldn't have felt or acted that way if it wasn't for your bipolar. You can't help you have it.

Oh, let's not forget RSN scamming a woman who is clearly going through mental issues (yes, I know she's an addict too, that has nothing to do with this) of thousands of dollars so he doesn't have to move out of grandma's basement. 

I'm sorry I'm not a middle aged mother who sits on streams all day (instead of watching your kids) with a man in his 20s to feel younger, if that's what you're asking. I'm 31 but I'm assuming you're older than me. Funny enough, your maturity sure doesn't show it.

Deity confronted him when the TCAP comm left comments. Vince manipulated him. It's no different than when someone is in a relationship and is manipulated. Just because someone told a woman her new bf was abusive & she didn't believe it, would you call them an idiot or shame them? He apologized to his community, he didn't do anything to anyone that deserves an apology. He was naive. A lot of us were. People make mistakes. You're straight acting like he's a predator or he's a white nationalist. People like you have a hard time remembering that even YouTubers are human. They make mistakes.
