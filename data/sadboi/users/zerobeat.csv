A significant percentage of the population in the US already considers them compromised, untrustworthy, and as having a goal to undermine the public’s interest. As the propaganda machine continues to accelerate, those ideas are only going to get worse.

CrappyDesign,fqteugb,t1_fqtc2ws,1589637585.0,"Essentially there are a limited number of paths the internet can take in the future. We assume AI will continue to get better and that it will be used by companies, governments, and individuals to mimic people online. Right now this is already being done manually by troll farms in various countries and by ad agencies who want to push a product. In the near future, AI will be good enough at solving captchas and other “prove you are not a robot” gates to sites that will approach a limit — the text ones, for example, had to keep getting more and more complicated in their disguising text that pretty soon the examples were not even readable by humans. So we switched to photo content and those gates are currently beginning to fail. 

Once AI can solve these problems and gain easy access, sites with free anonymous user account models will become flooded to the point of not being usable. Twitter’s trash content will go even higher, Reddit comments will be flooded with trash as bot nets upvote their own bots’ comments and posts, and Facebook will become filled with user accounts in which even the profile picture of the account is of a person that doesn’t exist as it will be AI generated. The bot nets will be given directives to flood comments with certain topics or respond in certain ways and Wikipedia articles will enter editing battles where the back and forth fight over an article’s contents is fought in millisecond responses. And the thing is that it is going to get more and more difficult to tell what content is published by a human and what is published by a bot. You have already likely gotten into political arguments on Reddit with an AI bot and dismissed some of their unusual comments as “oh this person is an idiot”. 

It will force social media companies to make a choice. They won’t be able to die in a sea of computer generated content, so anonymous accounts will likely go the way of the dinosaur. Many social media companies will briefly require a reversible credit card charge of $1 to prove you are a human but even this will fall thanks to the massive databases on darknets of stolen credit card data. One possible path is that a company like Google/Facebook will have “verified” accounts and will be treated as a centralized source of trust on who is human but the public may not take to that — we’ve all grown used to enjoying this pseudo-anonymity that we use on sites like this one. 

This means that in the near future, information in text form on the internet will become very, very untrustworthy. Much more so than it is today. And that’s a problem given that more and more people now treat public comments sites as a valid source of information about what is going on in the world and to research records of past events. Information death of the internet means that inevitably the propaganda and crap out there written by bot nets will be the primary driver of content and not individuals.

And, honestly, we need to reach this point sooner rather than later. We’ve opened a bit of an ugly Pandora’s box with social media that has a lot of real world influence. The sooner we can solve this problem - or at least know not to trust online material - the better."

So now every day I speak with them I get to hear about how if he catches COVID-19 it will ""absolutely kill him"".

slowcooking,foqhkjh,t1_foq8rrt,1587993730.0,Curious if the cooking lamb had an unusual odor to it for you?  I tried cooking lamb shanks for the first time recently and the smell was a bit strange.

me interpret a lot of things he said and did differently. The episode of him in Borneo just messed with me too much - everything had too much of a dark thread to it. I still haven’t gotten back to finishing the series.  David Chang’s Ugly Delicious gives me my world food adventure fix for now. 

God damn we lost something good with Bourdain. He knew how to write, he knew how to speak to people, he knew how to approach politics."
Anxiety,foog19d,t3_g8ecwm,1587938297.0,"40 here. In retrospect anxiety broke my childhood, teen years, and twenties. I can now look back and see that it is hereditary and I was showing signs from a very young age. 

Thank goodness for medication and therapy."

Anxiety,foktezu,t3_g815ow,1587848601.0,"Small amounts do, especially for sleeping. I have an Indica strain and just a single hit from a vape pen has an interesting effect - it derails thought chains. Anxiety would frequently prevent me from sleeping well or getting to sleep at all, but cannabis will ensure my thoughts wander around seemingly at random rather than continue down a specific path of worry. What would have been a line of thoughts about work the next day will veer off course onto unusual topics that are related to each other but not worrying. And with that I will slip right off to peaceful sleep."

Anxiety,fodqe8i,t3_g6y8ub,1587688155.0,"Anti-depressants don’t make people suicidal - they give people who are so depressed that they don’t even have the drive to commit suicide the energy to do so as it begins to bring them out of their depressive void. If that person can make it past that dangerous window as they get better then they generally do just fine. 

SSRIs do not change your brain, who you are, or how you think. They are a tool that helps break the cycles of depression and anxiety so that you can begin to help yourself get better. They work very well when coupled with changes in lifestyle and therapy. They take time to work and to adjust to - usually at least a month or more - and any side effects can usually be resolved through adjustments in dosage, what time you take it, or what medicine you end up on. 

I had a huge fear they would make me a different person. What I found was that they finally freed me from the endless anxious thoughts and I finally got to be myself, again."
