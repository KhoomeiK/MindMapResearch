It's not as much who I'd be seeing but that since last November I've been taking my niece to at least a show a month and I've really enjoyed both the shows and the 3-4 hour drives there and back.  Losing that experience hits harder than if I were just hitting up a show solo.  I feel for the artists, especially supporting bands that possibly *need* these shows to stay afloat."

massachusetts,fjiu7wf,t1_fjhee41,1583375851.0,Um...you have to provide proof of residency before you vote.  And you can only vote in a precinct if you live in that precinct.  So this person that's driving all over apparently has a lot of proof that they live in multiple places.
