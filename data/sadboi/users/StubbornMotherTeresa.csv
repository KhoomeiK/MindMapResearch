I've been using oral finisteride and minoxidil for years, expensive shampoos and hair treatments. It just keeps worsening over time.  This morning I woke up and noticed even more hair was gone at my front hairline... like 2 more inches.  I called in sick to work today.  I didn't know what else to do!

I've been doing a decent job of styling my hair so the hairloss is less noticeable, but I can't hide this.  I've been freaking out about my hairloss for about 15 years now and I'm exhausted. 

Having hair for me is tied to my feeling feminine. I'm afraid going ""natural"" will further hurt my self esteem, especially when I stop taking/doing things to prevent hairloss. 

I made an appointment at a wig shop for tomorrow.
