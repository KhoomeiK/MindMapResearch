truscum,fou810q,t1_fou6yhq,1588078528.0,"I don't want to say whether you have dysphoria or not because you haven't really given me much to go off, and I also think people should be cautious about telling people they don't have 'real' dysphoria because it's a very personal thing and the language we use to express what dysphoria is and isn't is still very vague. I don't understand why socialism would make you hate your masculine features though?

The phantom limb syndrome thing was more of a useful comparison, I don't think every trans person gets it in a literal sense (I've never felt a phantom vagina for example, though I've heard phantom penises are very common among trans guys). My point is that the brain doesn't simply interpret the rest of the body on the fly, it has an idea of what the body should be like and it's highly disturbing when this doesn't match up, and the part of the brain that manages this must be sexed because men and women respond very differently to things like hormones. To me the 'core' of gender dysphoria is this misalignment between the brain's body map and the bodies we're born with, and therefore applies to things like hormones and genitals.

From what I understand dysmorphia is rooted in a delusion or a highly exaggerated percetion about one's body. So someone who thinks they're morbidly obese and need to get skinnier when they're underweight would be a pretty blunt example. Body dysphoria is rooted in an accurate perception of the body, but I don't think all body dysphoria is caused by the mismatch I mentioned above, I think you can pick some types of it up from socialisation (a good example is body hair, women get body hair too and I don't think it's 'mapped' by the brain, but as a society we expect women to not have body hair or at least have much less compared to men). I think the line between body dysphoria and body dysmorphia can sometimes be murky too."
truscum,fou55y9,t3_g9lna8,1588076476.0,">Some may say it's because what they were experiencing was some form of dysphoria and didn't realise it. But what's the line? How much dysphoria is enough? I understand people here don't say you have to have X amount of dysphoria to be trans, but thats impossible to say. Are you saying that someone that hates their body hair qualifies as trans (or viable example for trans men)? If you aren't, then you are saying you do have to have a certain amount of dysphoria. If you are, you have just described every single person identifying a trans women, thus every person identifying as trans is valid. 

This is kind of an interesting point and I think it can be worth distinguishing between dysphoria that comes from socialisation and dysphoria that comes from a neurological problem. I buy into the theory that regions of the brain that determine body mapping in a trans person are far closer to their actual gender than the gender they were assigned at birth (so a trans woman would have regions of the brain that are far closer to a cis woman's) and therefore this causes stress from the body not aligning with the body map (a useful comparison is the stress people get from phantom limb syndrome, basically the brain has an idea of what the body should be like and it's psychologically uncomfortable and painful when the body isn't aligning with it). I don't see how something like body hair would fall under that, but something like genital dysphoria or general dysphoria from not having the right hormones are very clear examples of it. If someone goes on HRT for years and feels better for being on HRT, there's a very high chance they have or had dysphoria because if a cis person took HRT for the opposite sex it will usually mess them up psychologically (basically giving them gender dysphoria). I feel like the HRT thing is important to emphasise, because you can have a very strong feeling of dysphoria but that doesn't feel particularly specific, that often clears up after HRT because your finally getting the hormones your brain wants. I could easily see people not realising this feeling is dysphoria because of the way dysphoria is often talked about, and mistaking it for normal kinds of depression or other mental health issues.

Anyway I'm not fond of psychologists and trying to gatekeep access to medication to transition. I think transition should be a personal choice that's very easily accessible (obviously it shouldn't be freely accessible for kids, they should have to undergo psychiatric assessments and things like that), and we should talk more clearly about what dysphoria is and isn't so people can make sure they make the right choice for themselves."

You're welcome to paraphrase it. I doubt it's anywhere close to correct, as we simply lack any evidence to put an origin point for monogamy, not to mention that monogamy may well have been taken up independently by different cultures. You need something better than a 'good reason' to back up a sweeping claim.

>You don't need to be a marxist to apply material thinking, completely ignoring economic history and class in analysis makes analysis entirely redundant.

I don't ignore class or material analysis. I just don't make it my number one priority in historical analysis because there's no reason to do so."

Too bad it is. The history of the family has moved on from 19th century scholarship.

>Monogamy was the first form of the family not founded on natural, but on economic conditions. The victory of private property over primitive and natural collectivism

Except there's literally no evidence for this. Like a lot of historians/anthropologists (especially 19th century ones) it's just conjecture. It's basically a 'just so' story that sounds kind of right but lacks any actual historical evidence to back it up. The reason people may take up monogamy on both an individual and societal level is multi-faceted and complex, and is probably something we'll never have a good answer for. There's zero reason to privilege economic reasons, just like there's zero reason to buy into the Marxist idea that the material base of a society is the fundamental driving force of history in general."
