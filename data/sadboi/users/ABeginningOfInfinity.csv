thinkpad,fpg8d38,t1_fpdm4rp,1588597014.0,"This looks like the AlphaGo team at DeepMind. The software engineer with the Thinkpad at the end of the table looks like [Julian Schrittwieser](https://www.technologyreview.com/innovator/julian-schrittwieser/).

Edit: sauce is at the bottom of the thread. It’s a screen grab from an AlphaGo meeting of some sort"
GERD,fn8cq73,t1_fn6dadd,1586738742.0,This is a great comment and made me feel better about my own symptoms. I’m also a 32M
Anxiety,fmbi6dn,t1_flegclu,1585926853.0,"This is very similar to my symptoms. It’s awful! But it’s helpful to know I’m not alone. Take care, I hope your symptoms have improved."
Anxiety,fmbgdic,t1_fm8tpxw,1585925818.0,Glad you’re getting better! I go through phases of doing better/worse with my anxiety
ADHD,fm6ulgo,t1_fm597e7,1585803696.0,I second the Daylio app. Been using it for over a year now.
HealthAnxiety,flvu77r,t1_fko3kev,1585532213.0,"I know this is an old thread, but going for walks makes my symptoms disappear too! I wish it were easier to go for walks now, though. Hope you’re doing well!"
Physics,fl5t23d,t1_fl4tgog,1584844975.0,"This is great. I’m and undergraduate (albeit an older student - I’m 32) doing the same but working with a math graduate student. We are going through Wald’s GR book and it is *dense* but fun. Things have been wonky for a lot recently, and I haven’t had a chance to interface with him, so I might drop in your office hours Monday, even just to chat a little bit about GR. 

Thanks for doing this!"
ADHD,fkj43au,t1_fkiy5bf,1584235696.0,This made me laugh! Thank you
Covid19_Ohio,fk64lf8,t1_fk60y9g,1583893586.0,Luckily she said her symptoms resolved. But still - that won’t be the case for everyone.
compsci,fiy0m5l,t1_fiwjyr3,1582830131.0,"Great suggestion. There are posts in his blog that are accessible to non-cs folks, too."
OSU,fb7yh6t,t3_ebs2z4,1576602196.0,Congrats! Same here
