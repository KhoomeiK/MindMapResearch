abuse,fjkxdw9,t3_fdzb4y,1583435786.0,"I am so sorry for what you're experiencing. You should never feel unsafe in your own home, much less with your partner. 

Is there any sort of organization where you live that aids people in abusive situations like these? Safe havens?"
abuse,fjhz2ec,t3_fdegcy,1583357703.0,"My friend, he was most certainly, obviously gaslighting her. Your paranoia is understable but do think that this was most likely because she had a perfectly normal reaction to an abuse tactic that's almost flawless when the person is living with their abuser. That's what they're best at - pushing their victim away from those they love and antagonize them. This is literally it. Gaslighting and isolation are prime tactics for people like your S/O's ex.

&#x200B;

I suggest you open the conversation as such to her, and bring your concern and desire (for her own wellbeing) to reconnect with her family and patch things up now that she's out of that situation."
abuse,fjhyeo6,t3_fdj5so,1583357351.0,"Pardon me for sounding a little insensitive or inconsiderate to your position... but I still feel you're not being fair enough to her. Of course you can't summarize the entire relationship or catch the true depth of the issue on just a post, but... you cannot rush healing. No matter what. I believe she needs someone much more patient, much more understanding, and you've implied you don't love her enough to wait for her to heal. What she went through is deeply traumatic and I think the last thing on her priority list is having great sex. 

&#x200B;

If your relationship is already open, why not cut her some slack on not being able to fill in your physical needs? You are aware she's not maliciously trying to neglect them - and once again, my friend... you must look at the bigger picture. What's more important: her healing process being well-paced and processed, or the sex? If you answer the latter, maybe you should pull out of this relationship and seek something else that will accommodate for your needs ASAP - not just for you, but for her too because what she truly needs is someone to stick through with her and not rush her through healing. If you're willing to take the steps and have the willpower to go through in becoming such a person, more power to you 

&#x200B;

But if not, honestly I would say just cut things off relationship wise and stay friends. I do admire that you've listened to her, and well done on letting her have you as a listening ear. But healing should be above sex in a relationship. Always..."
abuse,fjhx73k,t3_fdjci6,1583356709.0,"Hey, I'd like to start off by emphasizing that it's not your fault. 

&#x200B;

I'm in a very similar situation, more or less; regarding the whole enduring sexual abuse from various male adult figures in my life during childhood/pre-teen years, have been raped in my young adulthood too and somehow am a sex addict now as well. I feel for you, truly. 

&#x200B;

I used to have so many dubcon and rape fantasies, masturbate to them, be turned on by the instances in which I was taken advantage of and I'm still deeply disturbed by it - I craved similar situations, I even had an all out rape fetish.  I feel you, I do. 

&#x200B;

These, I've learned recently, are trauma responses. We're trying to re-contextualize what we've gone through and view it in a way in which we have some ""control"" over it, via being sexually aroused by it as supposed to all out screaming and terrified, which is how victims of sexual abuse are often expected to behave. It's normal, but it can be scary to see yourself feeling in such a way - ""am I supposed to? Does this mean I wanted it"" No, you didn't want it, it's not your fault, if someone doesn't go for full consent or entirely ignores you saying no they're disgusting and a molester and/or rapist. 

&#x200B;

I'm sending a lot of love your way, I really hope on the day to day you're okay. Again: This is normal. You're trying to cope. It's not your fault."
abuse,fje172b,t3_fcvwlh,1583263216.0,"My dear, I am so sorry this awful person has backed you into such a corner that you feel you can't see the light anymore - that is not at all what love should be like, that is not at all the kind of environment your child-to-be deserves to grow up in, nor the treatment you must endure. You WILL find yourself once more. But first you need to depart. It will be hard to do and maybe it will be weeks or even months before you muster up the courage, but... please try to contact your family. Ask them for help. 

&#x200B;

You've been through so much trauma with A as well as this awful, awful person you're currently with. You deserve love and kindness and understanding and respect, not this twisted gut feeling of hoping for the best but expecting the worst.

&#x200B;

I believe you will benefit sooo much from talking to your family and perhaps moving in with them for a while as you get back up on your feet. For you, for your child. 

&#x200B;

I have been in nothing but physical, mental, abusive relationships for the better half of a decade before I found the love of my life only last year, and we're now getting married. There is hope! Please believe me! I'd love to listen, I'm here if you need to talk"

It's definitely difficult to ground yourself at the moment, it's not easy being called by such a cursed name and simply go on about your day.
