Psychosis,foazgfh,t3_g6mh9v,1587654372.0,"rereading this again i truly think my question was insensitive, everyone has the ability to love no matter their illness. was just conflicted of the idea by one person with psychosis and their behaviour"
Psychosis,foautfn,t1_foatymf,1587652840.0,i see that for him and i can’t imagine how painful it must be. thank you x
Psychosis,foaul92,t1_foatxif,1587652741.0,your boyfriend sounds incredibly genuine and wonderful. i’m so glad you have each other in your life. he does love you and will not fall out of love because it’s a choice he made with you and only you. you gave me a lot of insight and i want to learn and understand my boyfriend as much as i can. thank you so much love ❤️
Psychosis,foat6bq,t1_foas0om,1587652091.0,what answers can i expect when i try asking him that? would it be a result of his true feelings or the psychosis talking? hope that made sense. i understand that mental illness is no excuse for abuse but i always try to seperate him from his mental illnesses
Psychosis,foasvcn,t1_foasjhi,1587651922.0,"yes he also has bipolar, diagnosed with psychosis and is getting treated. what are your specific delusions and are they experienced commonly with those who have psychosis?"
BPD,fn4wcwm,t3_fzf1fn,1586650409.0,yes please!!
