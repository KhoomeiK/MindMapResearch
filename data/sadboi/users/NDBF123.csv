When you say “the left” I assume you mean the entire Democratic Party, but that’s also split. The more Bernie wing of the party are treating Biden the same way the entire party treated Kavanaugh. The more establishment wing of the party has been silent. Biden’s accusation should be taken seriously and when people like Biden himself who say “Believe all women” are now dead silent is worrying. It once again shows that that wing of the party will always put themselves first. Trumps gonna be ruthless with this along with much, much more against Biden who isn’t the debate he was in 2012."
