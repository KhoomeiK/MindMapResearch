One of my best friends left me 2 or 3 days ago just from this. I only reached to her for help. I have a lot of pent up sexual frustration and that literally made her sick to talk about. She's not the first friend Ive driven away. Everyone is a matter of time and I cant do it anymore. I just hurt people until they give up and it would be better without me."
