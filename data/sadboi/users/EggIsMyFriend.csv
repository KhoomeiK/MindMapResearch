The time and place I was raised in, we didn't know or talk about trans people, so, I was told to stop making a fuss. ""Fuss"" included being a 13-year-old alcoholic, but hey. I got used to eventually when I realized there was no way out. I managed. I was never comfortable being a woman, but I had to be one.
2. I did give ""getting being a woman right"" a real good go. I tried, hard. Tried to relate to strong, unconventional women. Even called myself a lesbian (I was so bad at being a lesbian), got all into women's rights, etc. Because being a woman is nothing but pain, right? Of course, I could relate.
3. There was no way I could be trans because only trans people are trans. Logic. Also, I admit I did think poorly of trans people at one point. Back in my day, the only trans people I know about were the grotesquely transphobic caricatures of trans women in popular media. 
4. My sexuality is an absolute trainwreck. I've called myself a lesbian and bi/pan, but honestly, I'm really fairly gay. Men are so unfairly fucking beautiful. I'll never look like that, and I'll never have that. So, attraction and jealously both.
5. I think every trans person wonders if it's a fetish at some point. It was never a huge concern for me, because I'm not really into porn and all that, so I didn't think it was a fetish in my case. I did wonder if it was a phase, but it would have to be a really long-lasting phase for me.
6. This question has to be broken into two parts for me. Yes, I took a break from everything trans-related because I decided it was too much. No, I didn't take a break from porn because I'm not really into porn. I'm such a prude that I feel bad for seeing the actors in intimate situations, even though it is literally their job and they are there to be seen. Porn just isn't my thing, trans, cis, gay, straight or otherwise.
7. This has never been a sexual thing for me. What finally broke me was horrific chest dysphoria and not being able to pretend I was ok with any of this anymore.
8. Obviously, I cannot speak to the ""all of this"" that you need. I can say that starting T and transitioning has made me feel like I'm finally sane and I finally exist. I'm losing everything, but I'm gaining myself.

So, yeah. My experience is different than yours. However, that doesn't mean you need to feel guilt and shame. Everyone is different. There's no one, singular trans narrative that describes us all. You sound like some other stories of trans women I've read, so I know you aren't alone."

I wish I had words of wisdom and solace for you, but I only have empathy. I have no real hope of ever having a partner again or of being able to develop real friendships or repair my relationship with my family. I doubt I'll ever pass. The world will always see me as a lost little butch, who is now going to grow facial hair (which I do want, but I know how it will look to people) and go bald. I'll be a joke. I'm happier, within myself. I finally feel sane.  But it's good I'm learning to love myself, cause I'm the only one who is going to."

I had a few to start with so, I think it gave the T something to work with. It's not precisely a beard by any stretch of anyone's imagination.
