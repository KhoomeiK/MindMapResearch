i guess if i had to put a name on it i was the misanthropic idiot

i had friends but i burned those bridges after highschool

i hated everything even myself and now years later the hate is still there but its faded

its more of regret now .....like im a failure . if it werent because of certain circumstances id actually be in prison for being a school shooter tbh

for all the 5 years i spent in highschool i actually wondered why i was forced to go it

when i shouldve wondered why i wasnt paying attention in class for trying to excel 

hell i even wondered how anyone could love that place . it wasnt till after that i realized why

life with no education is basically a death sentence 

if i had known what i know now id be a totally different dude ,sure id be alone ,depressed ,suicidal but id have a job my own house and basically a decent existence ....but alas ive doomed myself to wanting to fucking die a goddamn loser with no progeny 

my existence if anyone could see it from the outside looking in wouldve been a massive waste"
