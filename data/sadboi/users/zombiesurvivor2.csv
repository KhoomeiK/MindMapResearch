VALORANT,foxay07,t3_ga2hmu,1588138643.0,honestly the best advice I give to a person that is being verbally abused by a toxic player is just to mute them
PiratesOutlaws,fkne8av,t1_fkndx7h,1584363385.0,"thank you for the insight, I  just learned that you can deactivate packs which is very helpful as I wanted certain cards but was getting ones from other packs. This will really help with strategy."
PiratesOutlaws,fkndr3z,t1_fkndk6w,1584362996.0,Oh neat I was unaware of this thanks for the heads up

AskReddit,fjjlcqx,t3_fdrhm0,1583401777.0,I keep thinking about the different choices I could have made in my life and the positive outcome instead of the depressing ones that occured.
AskReddit,fjjl92e,t3_fdh6qq,1583401624.0,I'm most likely never gonna reach the point where they can cure my disease that is causing my handicap which in turn is causing my depression. Probably won't find a job I enjoy or a partner I can be happy with either.
AskReddit,fjjl4tg,t3_fddueu,1583401451.0,About 50% would have killed themselves and the other half would makes about the other half commiting suicide.

gaming,fdh2a9r,t1_fdgq1ks,1578413834.0,Are you talking bout bonus stars? Can't you turn them off?
depression,fbwum5a,t1_fbv8h5d,1577159868.0,"I used to feel something from doing things like that but it just feels like why bother. There isn't a means to an end. Material objects are meaningful to the person but I don't see what the point is to owning object ""a"" or ""b"". Gaming achievements mean nothing anymore just invisible points that won't mean anything in life. I just don't see the purpose. Don't know if that answered what you asked or not."

relationship_advice,f2ubbwz,t1_f2ub89w,1570412159.0,Yeah that does make sense I guess. I just don't want to force her into a position she may not want to be in and just make the whole thing worse.
relationship_advice,f2uavo5,t1_f2uashl,1570411826.0,"Oh man I feel so wrong doing something like that, it feels like I am the cause."
relationship_advice,f2uapdw,t1_f2uakx5,1570411698.0,Yea maybe it's true and I'm just avoiding the only answer with Reddit.
relationship_advice,f2uamzb,t1_f2uairx,1570411647.0,ðŸ˜Ÿ she lives in the same town and I feel like this could really hurt her and may push her over the edge.
relationship_advice,f2uaee0,t1_f2uabk2,1570411473.0,That feels unhealthy to just not care about someone at all. I still do love her. I just wish there was a way we could leave without either if us getting hurt.
relationship_advice,f2ua8y1,t1_f2ua6bh,1570411361.0,That's what I meant when I said cut her out of my life. Only thing is I'm worried that she could hurt herself and then I would just blame myself.
depression,f2n0vkp,t1_f2mt5pi,1570310560.0,In all honesty I've basically forgotten all of them. I've tried to get back into learning but just haven't had the motivation.
depression,f2mouqm,t1_f2mkhpm,1570307322.0,"ive been programming for at least 4-5 years but nothing sticks and even then my programming etiquette sucks. I majored in CS with a minor in IS,IT and cybersecurity (the IS and IT minors were ""free""). My handicap is a dystrophy related mutation making movement hard for my arms and legs. Even in college people tell me my programming sucks and that I hold people back in group work. I feel like if I get a job I wont have the required knowledge to do it and mess up forever."
depression,f2mi31c,t1_f2mhl0w,1570305577.0,Gaming and programming but I suck at programming and gaming just bores me and I'm just seeing how pointless it is to play. I can't really even try that many new hobbies because of a handicap. I'm at the end of college with one class left and I am still struggling with my major.
depression,f2ls9br,t1_f2ls5hg,1570297733.0,Yea I just have literally no motivation to do anything and all the stuff I thought I enjoy just make me more depressed now
depression,f2ls1t9,t3_d9f2m4,1570297656.0,"Seriously my life right now, I'm the black sheep of my family even though everything is handed to me. I'm such a screw up I wish I just didn't exist."
