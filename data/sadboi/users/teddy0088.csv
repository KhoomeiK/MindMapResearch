The oldest film I picked is The Dark Knight from 2008

For me, I try to think about films that already have a cult following, or could potentially have one in the future. Also listing films that feel timeless

-Booksmart (Its one of the most joyous films as of late)

-Uncut Gems (Its a total experience)

-Once Upon a Time in Hollywood  (Its a masterpiece and Brad Pitt)

-The Dark Knight (The fanbase is wild and massive)

-Parasite  (The first foriegn film to win BP)

-Lady Bird  (It feels like a film that defines a generation)

-Gone Girl  (Its one of the best mysteries. A great ending)

-Get Out  (Genius script)

-Us  (Its just a fun movie)

-A Quiet Place (Like Uncut Gems, its an adrenaline rush)

-I, Tonya (A great script with amazing performances)

-Blade Runner 2049 (Gorgeous Cinematography. Will be taught in film schools)


-mother! (For the fact of how divisive it is)

-Cats (It was a cultural phenomenon. Think Rocky Horror)

-Toy Story 3 (Animated Masterpiece. Makes everyone cry)

-The Master (For the performances alone)

-Avengers Endgame (Highest Grossing film Cultural Event)

-Into the SpiderVerse (Again, Animated Masterpiece)

-A Star is Born (Shallow will stand the test of time. Think Whitney Houston Bodyguard)

-Bohemian Rahpsody (A musical drama that grossed almost 1 billion dollars....)

-Crazy Rich Asians (Feels like the type of movie that will play on TCM in 40 years)

-Bad Times at the El Royale (Feels like a Box office bomb that will become popular in the upcoming years)

-La La Land (Again, its just so joyous. And the soundtrack is great)

-Hustlers (JLo, Cardi B, etc. Feels like a cult film)

-Ready Or Not (It just FEELS like a cult film. Its SO good)

-Easy A (Feels like this generations Mean Girls)
