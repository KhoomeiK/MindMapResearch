AskMen,fqxxdne,t1_fqxeqld,1589739298.0,They have been for a while now. I have had mayne 2-3 dates with girls I asked and that was back in highschool. However I have had 3 great relationships with women who asked me and I have turned down a few as well. I think its more of the desperation that leads to rejection. When you don't feel you desperately need a relationship somehow they manage to fall into place. But you still have to put yourself in places to meet others.
AskMen,fqnv2w5,t1_fqn6lvw,1589501979.0,Its about the same for men and women about 20-30% each depending on geography religion class etc. Plus there are another 10-20% in the grey undecided area that could flip given the world's situation. But eliminating 2/3 or so of the dating pool doesnt help yoir odds of finding a partner for the long haul. I happened to get lucky but it definitely didn't help not wanting kids.
AskMen,fqfwfy0,t3_gikvpn,1589333051.0,Being forward. Confidence in a woman turns me on. Im great at learning what a woman likes or how to turn her on once you cut through the guessing. Allows me to put more energy into flirting and teasing. Atleast that is the feedback I have gotten.
AskMen,fqc0a7j,t3_ghwlrk,1589247475.0,"If they are repulsed by it then you are better off without them. I wouldn't advertise it ahead of time. Not because you might scare away good men, but you will attract creepers or guys who think you will be easy to play since your inexperienced. Ironically I think taking it slow might be best despite the fact you probably want to experience everything. It will allow you to as you round each base if you will. Or for some jumping in the deep end without a life vest and just finding a meaningless hookup just to get rid of the jitters for when you want to find something long term. But you know you better than us."
AskMen,fq60t0n,t3_ggloxl,1589122087.0,I have depression anxiety and schizoid personality disorder. But I am an expert at hiding them like a chameleon I can manage to make myself out to be average middle of the pack person in a crowd as my camouflage. I think they all sort of combine to make me seem normal albeit quiet and introverted. Never seemed to bother any of my dates or girlfriends. Even when I mention it I do it pretty casually and the only feedback I ever got was that I seem mysterious or complex which I just let them go with even if I don't see it.
AskMen,fq2ymok,t3_gghuka,1589061396.0,"Never mattered to me. I never asked. If she chooses to share thats on her. I think lying is the only thing that might cause me to be disappointed or break things off, but would depend on the degree. I think if she has a high # but owns it and is safe I respect that more because I like confident women who know what they want. I think of the women I knew with high counts about half were misguided thinking sex would lead to a relationship or people would like them. Not that I dont respect those women as much but I think they had insecurities or issues that I can't fix. The other half seemed to be very up front that they just wanted fun and weren't looking for anything but that at the time. Those women always kind of turned me on even if I wasn't 100% inti them before. But I have often been rather unconventional so Im not sure how many would agree"
AskMen,fpsdy9v,t3_gf3s4t,1588871848.0,"There are a few in hindsight. None that really eat me up though. But it is funny I always noticed interest from a woman when Im not interested or can't do anything, but the passed opportunities don't pop up until months or years later. I tend to be a bit nostalgic and sometimes wonder what if? I think most of this comes from my depression, because I often wonder similarly about other choices like career, college etc.. It does make me wish at times life was like a video game where I can keep trying to find the happiest path, but sadly much like video games the infinite choices in life start to eat you up and before you know it time has passed you by while you where in a fantasy."

AskMen,fp4ff10,t3_gb3i3d,1588297879.0,For me long term plans/goals are the only difference. I would have a hard time hooking up with someone I didn't see longer term possibilities with. Not that it needs to lead to that but the same characteristics need to be present. So really being okay with not having kids and wanting to live in the same area are essentially the difference.
AskMen,foophv6,t3_g8jctb,1587943722.0,"I was very guarded since I was 4-5 so I was already pretty cynical and weary of the world before I was really in it. I just try to put out a softer tone to the world so people dont think im a complete weirdo hermit. It was already hard enough to date and hook up being my weird ass self, being an ass would have had me dying alone and virgin."
AskMen,fo897n4,t3_g68f9u,1587592190.0,I would just ask him about it and see if he is willing to try some options. Im sure telling him you want his D in you wont upset him. Im 33 but my antidepressants give me wierd libido fluctuations. I take L-Arganine L-Citroline and acytel carnitine. They seem to help with bloodflow since the senses are dulled down there sometimes the brain is horny but the physical response isnt there and vise versa. Just my 2 cents since once you start on viagra or cialis often it makes your body lazy and can mean only being able to function when on it
AskMen,fo88lfp,t3_g69kcd,1587591869.0,"22ish. The sex was amazing and we had similar views and goals on life so why mess with a good catch. Being very introverted meant those ""playing the field"" days were more exhausting than fun. So most of my love life was with women who sought me out and my current SO checked more boxes than I could imagine even if I went out with a different woman every week"
AskMen,fo4u4an,t3_g5g2qc,1587511247.0,No child but a house and 11yrs together. Financially it wouldn't be prudent for her. Im indifferent on marriage as it doesn't mean much to me. We are both from divorced parents so ditto for her. On top of that I grew up really poor and if I want to be able to afford a happy life with her I cant afford $$ for a ring and a wedding. I have too many student loans and will no doubt need another career change in 5-10yrs. She likes the arraignment we have since she saves 10s of thousands a year towards early retirement living down a bit so we can split it all 50-50. I couldn't imagine wanting her to be punished for my poverty if something were to happen to me. Other than the mortgage
AskMen,fo0e5om,t3_g4y8ll,1587411425.0,"I think a lot of shaming is just hard wired genetics that we wont be able to kick as a society. It is anything that went against group norms from 1,000s of years back that we haven't evolved out of. I also think shame can be felt for things out of your control often like looks,gender race etc. I would guess that shame was a survival mechanism to keep people from being too individuallistic back when you literally needed a group to survive."
AskMen,fo0dngr,t3_g4ygkp,1587411103.0,Sent a few messages back and forth. Not sure if antidepressants I was starting nudged me to do it but I felt like saying congrats since I saw she was married and had kids. I think we both knew things would end but I always felt bad about timing and how we did it. Nothing terrible or toxic but still a regret of mine because she was a great woman. But im happy with my gf of past 10 years so there was no romantic messages or anything.

AskMen,fmfz7dn,t3_fuyi7d,1586037932.0,I have had a few careers but specializing often lets you operate independently and you wont have to manage people.

Lucky I am in a happy LTR because Im not sure I would remember how, plus online dating changed the game so much."
AskMen,fknxsli,t3_fjn0tk,1584376107.0,She doesnt mind as she watches it to sometimes. Only impact is perhaps seeing a few sex positions that looked fun and doable for an average person.

AskMen,fk6c5b4,t1_fk6avn3,1583898329.0,"All the same for me anyway. I always wierdly feel a need for all conflicts or interactions to have a conclusion. So I usually apologize or male amends shortly after even with strangers. Just cant find it in me to carry hate or anger to bed at night. Might be a personality trait or upbringing, but its always been that way. Perhaps training yourself or reading up on using emotional intelligence may help. Dont take that as an insult emotional intelligence is extremely rare and even those with good amounts are rarely even near 100% using it"

Also ruined my friends VHS tape because I kept rewinding and eventually melted the tape.
AskMen,fk68y0v,t3_fgpg4f,1583896223.0,Im fine with it. Just face different ways. I have also seen some guy friends who fell asleep jokingly cuddling and they are anything but gay. Just toss that BS hypermasculine shit out the window and it will be fine

AskMen,fk4g92u,t3_fgglmi,1583859847.0,"I like some moaning. I love it when I hit a spot or position that makes them louder than usual. Had a gf in college who would always try to be super quiet, then I found that if I pinned her arms above her head and sucked on her earlobes she couldn't stop moaning out loud. She hated it but I found it fun to let my neighbors know I was showing her a good time."
sex,fjxkmwq,t3_ffcxrc,1583676430.0,Usually enjoyable but being uncircumcised I had once or twice nearly been circumcised by a tug too far down.
AskMen,fjvxt33,t3_ff0jvj,1583632145.0,Wasnt against hookups or ONS but if the sex was good I would try for at least FWB or a relationship. I couldn't get into a hookup with someone who I didn't like more than just for sex so usually I ended up in LTRs. I think I also went about things differently than most guys. In hs I dated a bit but it never went anywhere (even dated 2 lesbians) so I stopped approaching at about 18 and let women approach/ask me. I think that combined with my very laid back personality drew a lot of confident women and most happened to want more than a ONS. But I think my sex/romance life is different than most.
AskMen,fjsbuhy,t3_fewn02,1583595532.0,I always say sorry and do similar things but I am also super introverted and depression makes it hard to do things for myself that dont benefit others more. I think what helps me is saying no to things I dont like or dont want to do. But I also never had an issue with ignoring or dropping toxic people from my life family included. So I suppose being comfortable with yourself is a good place to start. Practice enjoying being alone (not lonely) and once you feel confident you can keep yourself happy the rest with come naturally.

I also dont have any support system should things go bad, no family or friends for over 1000 miles.

It definitely dips after a few months but as long as it isnt extreme highs and lows it shouldn't be extremely noticeable. I think only key is to ""be yourself"" in the sense you are confident about who you are. So if they challenge you on a view or give you some shit for an unusual hobby you have to be able to stick up for yourself but do NOT get offended or defensive. Also dont just agree with everything they say. Keep it equal parts friendly ribbing and finding out about eachother. Good luck!"
dating_advice,fjaue2z,t3_fci9p2,1583180797.0,"For me it was all in the wording/delivery. I would come out and say I like you and would like to see you again if I liked the date. But I would say it in a confident but casual tone. I dont believe in those games where one person has the power/leverage/whatever. If I liked someone I went on a date with I dont want to risk missing out on more following a script. Of it helps I got a yes 100% of the time.

Was also so concerned about cumming to soon that I never came which made it kinda akward 15-20min in since the guy finishing is typically the grand finale.
AskMen,fi7dwa7,t1_fi7da6v,1582219499.0,"Nothing too specific. I guess just showing more realistic flaws in protagonists. I think in major hit movies they may give a character one flaw to make them seem ""vulnerable"" but its always some sort of BS like he is too loyal or something like that. I think some of the movies A24 puts out are great because they give everyone flaws so that there really isnt a good vs bad but a sort of grey.

AskMen,fgfu8ky,t1_fgftj7c,1580747724.0,I was never great at approaching or initiating but I lucked out and grew up around women so I can interact with them more easily once the ice is broken. Easier for me to make female friends than male. But since I dont present as very masculine (other than having a beard and kinda looking manly) I often never really took anything past friendship. Didnt bother me much since I didnt put any pressure on succeeding romantically. I think 2 years was maybe my longest dry spell. I am extremely introverted but being single use to force me to be more outgoing and then usually things came together when I was trying the least. I guess not really caring and not giving time to anyone I didnt want to waste it on came across as confident I guess. Unfortunately thats my best advice...accidentally seem confident.
AskMen,fgft6qy,t1_fgfrs41,1580747062.0,Not a bad idea. Honestly I always lucked out and women approached me or friends set me up. If I found myself single again I doubt I could remember how to approach (havent done it since like 17). I think being happy while alone (not lonely) is key. Then there are no expectations and somehow I think that ends up coming off as confidence. Plus for me I am a fairly private person with virtually no social media presence and I think I have maybe 1 photo in the last year that I could use for an app.
AskMen,fgfrlp6,t1_fgfqx14,1580746039.0,It can be. But I know a guy who is like 5-4 and gets plenty of dates. He says he doesn't just swipe on every woman takes time to read profiles so he can have a clever opening line about something other than looks and limits his time on apps to like 1-2hrs daily. Seems like solid advice but apps are like 2/3 men so its definitely more of an uphill I think. I think he has best luck on Bumble.
AskMen,fgfq5z6,t3_ey86xw,1580745104.0,Better for short term but sort of a detriment for long term. Thats based more on studies than personal observations. I think really it boils down to personality more than build.

dating_advice,fg7qn05,t3_ex5xcj,1580599024.0,Yes. I grew up around mostly women so I find it easier to communicate and be myself around women so I tend to often have more female friends. It does strain my romantic relationships sometimes but that was mostly teens and very early twenties.
AskMen,ffx5dr3,t3_evp1lc,1580318103.0,Dont worry about being single or not. Having casual flings is fun and all but if you find someone you click with dont pass it up because you think your too young. Have way more and way better sex in a relationship.

AskMen,ffx4utf,t3_evpm2h,1580317787.0,If I dont its because im drunk and fell asleep. Did fall asleep while on top once so I dont know if that counts.

AskMen,ffsinv0,t3_euy0wr,1580182631.0,"My gf complained about her weight frequently, and became too clingy and insecure. So I made an ultimatum of losing the weight or stopping with the insecurities (in a much more tactful manner than here). Now she is more confident and independent than ever. I think if you have the right intentions and do it politely then its acceptable."

AskMen,ffsi7v1,t3_euz0h9,1580182325.0,"She doesn't like receiving oral. She gets off but I only get a go a few times a year, like my birthday. She doesn't enjoy giving much, but is very enthusiastic when she says yes or offers on rare occasions."
AskMen,ffrrbtw,t3_euv0o6,1580164096.0,I did when antidepressants killed mine. Bit tough to stay up with no drive though. But she loves this thing I do with 2 hands so it was cool till it passed. I dont usually feel anything during sex so it was actually a tad bit of a relief to not crave it.
AskMen,ffrr3hw,t3_euvb9i,1580163949.0,Robots and AI. Although if they read this post...praise be to the overlords.

AskMen,ffr4ne5,t1_ffr4cag,1580150365.0,"You can. I wouldnt bother. I was born in Europe and brought to the us. I think if I had grown up in NYC it wouldnt have mattered much, but we ended up having to move to the bible belt where it was ridiculed. So to keep it a secret I avoided dating anyone from school or work. Killed my confidence entirely. Had successful relationships since, but really doubled down my depression when I was younger."
AskMen,ffqqadw,t3_eupgsv,1580141141.0,Talking about myself. I hate selling anything and found interviews and dates for that matter to feel like I was selling people on me.
AskMen,ffqq5ow,t3_eupgw9,1580141053.0,Same long term goals and similar interests.
AskMen,ffqq0nh,t3_eupm63,1580140960.0,I dont think it should matter to a mature adult. Makes no difference to me as I wouldnt sleep with someone I could envision seeing again.
