Ah brilliant thanks for the tip on social media. I totally agree about the consistent colouring. Did some competitor analysis and found everything on Insta is about looking pretty/consistent!  I wasn't on Instagram personally before so had a lot to learn! 

I really like the branding and colours you've used for your website. The logo is really powerful!"
blogs,fqkzz0f,t1_fqi926a,1589441551.0,Amazing thanks! I suspected this was the case. Can I check whether you were on a phone or computer?
mentalhacks,fm6g5s6,t1_fly6vbi,1585793320.0,"Thanks Chanpat for your reply! Hope you enjoyed reading these articles. My blog doesn't seek to solve mental illness but rather provides advice on simple behavioural changes to help prevent burnout and stress based on my own and other's experiences, and  also encourages trying self-care. It draws on advice from leading mental health organisations such as Mind. Hope that helps :)"

mentalillness,fk08slz,t3_ffkgzq,1583747412.0,"Amazing well done! Not sure if you've heard of Time to Change's Bigger Picture campaign which seeks to increase awareness of these mental illnesses, which are often left out of the mental health conversation in place of other 'softer' mental illnesses.

selfcare,fjw2r0w,t1_fjmt6sm,1583633822.0,I discuss these and what self-care can cover in this post:  [https://www.balancebetter.org/practical-advice/self-care-a-necessity-that-most-of-us-arent-taught-at-school](https://www.balancebetter.org/practical-advice/self-care-a-necessity-that-most-of-us-arent-taught-at-school)
selfcare,fjw2lg9,t3_fe92a9,1583633765.0,"My self-care is not forcing myself to take too much on and understanding what I need at the time based on my energy levels:

For example:

* Allowing enough time to get between meetings so that I'm not rushing and stressed out
* Refusing one more drink at the pub to reduce the likelihood of a hangover the next day
* Giving myself a day of annual leave to do nothing in particular 
* Realising which activities are draining and trying to find a way to change the situation (i.e. delegation, avoidance if possible or making them more bearable)
* Choosing to stay in rather than go on a night out with friends"
mentalhealth,fjw1wg7,t3_ff5lde,1583633532.0,"I'm so sorry to hear that you have been feeling this way and understand how tough it is. I have had periods of depression and anxiety so have been in the same boat at several periods throughout my life.

I turn to several things during these periods - my partner and a close friend who is amazing when I'm feeling like this. Even if we just sit together in silence, it's nice to know they are there. 

I also do yoga - it might sound cliched but the deep breathing that yoga forces you to do is really relaxing. Yoga with Adriene is an incredible channel that features videos for when you feel depressed/anxious. She has such a supportive vibe that it feels like a close friend is championing you. Also, alternative nostril breathing is another way to force yourself to breathe deeply. 

I also love reading books that are light-hearted like a good old chick lit or  a thriller as it keeps my mind engaged. Additionally, I like to draw and colour in. Doing things I enjoyed as a kid makes me feel safe in these times. 

Additionally, have you got the option to try a different therapist or type of therapy? Sometimes the therapist themselves isn't right or the type prescribed isn't the right one."
mentalhealth,fjw0jxy,t3_few3i4,1583633050.0,"Well done for telling them! That's super brave. Sounds like your manager is really supportive and understands what is important in life. You sound like you're going through a lot so it was good to communicate this. 

Also this isn't as uncommon as you think so don't feel bad! I have broke down in front of a few managers in my career whilst I was dealing with my mental health issues and I have only worked for 5 years."
