GaySex,fiz3fyv,t3_exxt1o,1582853237.0,"I was that way when I was a teenager. I was obviously sexually attracted to guys but I was too repressed yet to really recognize my sexuality. When I was in my early 20's I met a guy who was really not that great looking, but he was so sincere and just so kind to me. He was a daddy type, so I think he had skills with flirting with a shy young guy. But he was so respectful, and took me out on dinner dates with no expectations, just dinner & talking. I did fuck him, he was a freak in the sheets too and it was fun discovering new things in bed with him. I wound up moving and our relationship parted ways, but from then on I saw guys much differently, because a lot of guys are really sweet, and tbh that makes sex so much more fulfilling when that veneer of like embarrassment or awkwardness is gone and there is just a realness between you both and perhaps even some romance. Anyways, not saying you will feel the same, but maybe just open yourself up to the possibility that being romantic with a guy would make things better for you."

depression,f5t9dm7,t3_dp6lon,1572453336.0,"No. I was a late bloomer, didn't really start getting my life together until I was 29 when I had my home built for me and pursuing all those 'adulting' goals that I never thought I could before. It is never too late, except for reallllly old people. Just think about this....when your 80, looking back 20 years puts you to 60, another to 40...so you have another 3.5 entire lifetimes ahead of you, and really, our childhood to 18 doesn't count against us...so you need to give yourself some slack for being like all the rest of us normal ppl and not being immediately successful (however u define that) in just a few years of your independent life.

PoliticalHumor,f5l6gfi,t1_f5l43qt,1572274635.0,"I don't find it fair at all, but given that we are a situation where indiscriminately jailing the opposing partisans could very well lead to civil unrest on a national scale *because* those partisans and their sick POTUS *wants* that outcome; I think the Dems are making very wise decisions. There will be more & more ridiculous displays from the republicans as the impeachment rolls, on, we just got to buckle up and keep the faith that goodness will prevail over evil minded fools like Trump and his supporters."
