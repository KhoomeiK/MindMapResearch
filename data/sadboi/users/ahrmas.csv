AmItheAsshole,fhb1783,t3_f29816,1581432424.0,"YTA because when your mom told you no you acted like an entitled child. I understand it’s your money, but that’s a lot to spend on one commission.

AmItheAsshole,fhawima,t3_f28j3c,1581428981.0,NAH. They’re your parents and are just concerned about you. However you’re entitled to your privacy and therapy is your safe space. It’s totally ok not to share as long as you aren’t in any danger.

AmItheAsshole,fhatw4z,t1_fhatmrp,1581426843.0,If he wanted to keep it a place to go with just his friends he shouldn’t have started bringing his partner there in the first place.

AmItheAsshole,fhat9vq,t3_f280qv,1581426296.0,This is now the 3rd time you posted this in like 45 minutes. You’re just being a troll at this point.
AmItheAsshole,fhat6z8,t3_f27uo4,1581426223.0,"YTA. I doubt the soda became flat because you shook it once, however keep your hands off of things that don’t belong to you. That was a stupid joke.

AmItheAsshole,fhat2a8,t3_f27yfn,1581426106.0,NTA. Coming out is a very personal thing and it’s not fair of your friend to try to make you do it before you’re ready.
AmItheAsshole,fhaswvl,t3_f27xw2,1581425969.0,NTA. Your partner sounds insecure. If you’re having fun and not doing anything wrong I say go for it and enjoy yourself! It’s just dancing.
AmItheAsshole,fhasqoj,t3_f27wbd,1581425816.0,NTA. Just be honest and say that too much noise keeps you awake and you feel better on the couch.
AmItheAsshole,fhasjov,t1_fhas2hw,1581425635.0,I don’t think she was pretending to be something she’s not. More like she had interest in something or at least thought she did and then after awhile realized she didn’t like it as much as she may have thought she did. Interests change over time.
AmItheAsshole,fhasfm4,t3_f27ssl,1581425529.0,"YTA. Mental illness is rough, I’m right there with you. But a relationship is a partnership, it should be 50/50. You both working to help support each other financially, mentally, around the house...etc. you aren’t holding up your end of it. Eventually that does lead to harsh feelings and resentment. You need to start working on getting yourself better so you can start contributing again. Get to the doctor, get some medication, find a therapist or if you’re really having a rough time, get admitted to the hospital for a little bit until they can stabilize you. You can’t just lay down and let your illness take over."
AmItheAsshole,fhas4a5,t3_f27ob0,1581425215.0,"NTA. She’s your child, it would be wrong not to include her in your special day. There’s no reason any other children need to be in attendance if you don’t want them to be."
AmItheAsshole,fhas01w,t3_f27pcp,1581425097.0,YTA for trying to turn her into something she’s not. It sounds like she’s tried but she’s just not into it like you are. People have different likes and interests and that’s ok!
AmItheAsshole,fharcze,t1_fhar76m,1581424388.0,Kids say stupid things. But this goes above and beyond just saying something stupid. He’s literally threatening the life of someone else. That’s not ok at any age.
AmItheAsshole,fhar5xn,t3_f27n1o,1581424194.0,NTA. You’re looking out for your moms best interest and nobody can fault you for that. It sounds like your mom has some issues and could use some help seeing things clearly. I’m not sure if your words will change anything but it’s worth a try.
AmItheAsshole,fhar0ni,t3_f27lez,1581424043.0,Why are you posting this again? You got plenty of answers on your previous post.
AmItheAsshole,fhaqwp5,t3_f27k1u,1581423928.0,NAH. I have mental health issues too and I get it. My husband is a great support but he has a life too and I can’t always rely on him to make me feel better. The same goes for you. Your boyfriend had plans. He talked with you as long and he could and then went out to enjoy himself. You need to find some ways to cope with your mental health issues on your own without relying on someone else constantly. It’s easier said than done but the only person you can 100% rely on all the time is yourself.
AmItheAsshole,fhaqnq5,t3_f27jg2,1581423675.0,NTA. He’s staying in the room you’re paying for. He should have asked first.

AmItheAsshole,fhaq9ev,t1_fhaq271,1581423257.0,So he should just continue to go to school and have to feel unsafe and get told he’s going to be murdered? He should absolutely speak up and say something. Why wait until there are warning signs and it’s possibly too late.
AmItheAsshole,fhaq2o9,t3_f27g7c,1581423049.0,NTA. If he’s making threats you need to report him right away!
AmItheAsshole,fhapysc,t3_f27fe7,1581422924.0,NTA. Your brother is old enough to pay for his pizza on his own. He shouldn’t keep coming to you for the money because he doesn’t plan accordingly and makes sure he has the cash on hand.
AmItheAsshole,fhaptn0,t3_f27dsa,1581422758.0,Try posting this in r/advice You might get a better response there.
AmItheAsshole,fhapqvf,t3_f27dii,1581422666.0,NTA for now. I feel like there’s some of the story missing here. You said she blocked you because you put her relationship in danger...how were you a danger to her relationship?
AmItheAsshole,fhapl70,t3_f27bvp,1581422475.0,NTA. I would have slammed the door in their face for being such a jerk about it.
AmItheAsshole,fhapgkx,t3_f27ase,1581422313.0,NAH. You’re grown and can do what you want. It’s kind of weird that he would reach out after so long. Just be careful OP. If he was abusive in the past there’s no way of knowing what his motives are.
AmItheAsshole,fhapbcd,t3_f27aol,1581422109.0,YTA. Maybe she just needs some practice? She’s not going to get better if people don’t let her drive places.

AmItheAsshole,fhaoakl,t1_fhansvn,1581420582.0,I’m a woman and I’ve never done that. But then again I’m not a shallow asshole. I’d rather get to know someone and base my opinion of them on their personality rather than going on looks alone.
AmItheAsshole,fhanfso,t3_f26r8s,1581419459.0,YTA. What gives you and your friends the right to judge anyone else based on how they look?
AmItheAsshole,fhancww,t3_f26nzw,1581419351.0,YTA. Try to see if from the Youtubers perspective. It’s probably pretty creepy to have a fan send something to your house randomly. Just because the address is somehow listed on the internet doesn’t mean you should use it.
AmItheAsshole,fham75b,t1_fhalrkh,1581417712.0,"Of course people are allowed to grow and change. However, even if she has changed and is a better person now that doesn’t undo any damage she’s caused people in the past by bullying. You can forgive but never forget. It seems to me like the OP is still very hurt by her actions. I just wish they went ahead and dealt with that hurt in a different way instead of retaliation."

AmItheAsshole,fhal15z,t3_f26e71,1581415979.0,ESH. Her for being a bully to begin with and you for sending those messages out to be put in the paper. That’s a bully move. You’re no better than she is now.
AmItheAsshole,fhakxip,t3_f26cz4,1581415830.0,NTA. It was 20 minutes. If he couldn’t handle that what’s he doing being a godfather to your child? What if something happens and he needs to step up and take responsibility for your son.

AmItheAsshole,fhajvik,t3_f263uh,1581414253.0,NAH. My husband and I call each other tons of nicknames too and I may have accidentally called him a chunky butt once. He got offended because he is sensitive and it sounds like your boyfriend is too.
AmItheAsshole,fhajr2m,t3_f263wk,1581414071.0,NTA. You bought the ticket before you knew when the wedding was. They just happened to fall on the same day. That’s not your fault.
AmItheAsshole,fhajd9s,t3_f260gb,1581413503.0,YTA. Why does it matter how he writes a post on his Facebook? As long as he’s not being hateful and saying bad things his formatting shouldn’t really matter that much that you needed to call him out on it.
AmItheAsshole,fhaj7mt,t3_f25wy2,1581413270.0,"ESH. All school is hard. But, some majors are a lot harder than others. I think your friend is a jerk for belittling what others are doing and I think your a jerk for what you said to her. You’re also a bit of a jerk for going into her messenger and reading her private conversations."
AmItheAsshole,fhaizva,t3_f25xu3,1581412947.0,"This is weird...I don’t even know what to say to this because it almost sounds fake. I’ve never heard of findom before. So this guy gave you money just because he got a thrill out of it? What did you give him in return? I’m not trying to be disrespectful, I just really don’t understand this. If he gave you the money willingly, I’d say there’s no reason to give it back to him. Maybe this will teach him to be smarter with his money and not do silly things when he has a family to support. NTA."
AmItheAsshole,fhaib9x,t1_fhai7ax,1581411959.0,"I don’t blame you for not wanting to do anyone else’s job. I wouldn’t either! Group projects just suck all around for numerous reasons. Somebody had to do the conclusion, and she’s the asshole for slacking on her part and not doing it. ESH for different reasons. I’m glad it got done, that’s the important part. Hopefully you all get a good grade!"
AmItheAsshole,fhai2r9,t3_f25qnw,1581411625.0,"ESH. This is why I hate group projects because your grade literally depends on how others do their work. You all should have communicated with each other better and worked together a little better so you could all accomplish your tasks on time. I understand the frustration of your friend when they got angry about the mistakes on your part of the assignment. Part of your job should have been to proofread your part and fix the errors before you sent it off. It shouldn’t be up to someone else in the group to fix it. As far as the conclusion goes, it sucks that nobody else had finished their work and was able to do it so it got put on you. But someone has to do it. If you had the easiest part I don’t see any harm in them asking you to do a little extra while they finished up what they had to do. It might not be fair that you had to do extra work but in group projects the work load isn’t always going to be an even split."
AmItheAsshole,fhahnm1,t3_f25n61,1581411029.0,"NTA. I’m assuming you have a job so some of the money in your account belongs to you. If that is the case I see no problem wanting to treat your kids to dinner. It’s really not any of your new husbands business how you choose to parent, regardless of how old your kids are. It seems to me, based on the point you brought up about the tires, that he wants to be the big hero and the one to pay the way but only when it’s convenient for him to do so. Good for you for standing your ground!"
AmItheAsshole,fhafluo,t3_f257eh,1581408249.0,YTA. You should have picked your daughter up and took her inside until the dog was gone. Then you should have called the local authorities to properly handle the issue if the dog was as aggressive as you say it was.

I could see where your brother is coming from when he says you’re a financial drain if he thinks you’ve been living there for so long with no job or source of income for yourself. Why not just let him know you’re working and doing well for yourself and your father? You don’t have to go into specific details. But it seems like you could be saving yourself a lot of family drama just by letting him in a little.
AmItheAsshole,fh8auz1,t3_f1pi3r,1581355809.0,YTA. Give them a chance to do right by their child.

AmItheAsshole,fh7qype,t3_f1q9nd,1581342259.0,ESH. Your husband isn’t a child and you shouldn’t have to put parental blocks on his phone to stop him from viewing things he shouldn’t be. He needs to get control of these habits on his own. I’m glad y’all are going to couples counseling but I really hope he is planning on doing some counseling solo to work on his issues.
