Life offers so much more than what you're experiencing right now. Some people want nothing but what you have, and others want nothing less. The important thing is that you communicate with your SO.

Dogtraining,fav3exn,t3_eamr5h,1576355343.0,"I personally have never had any issues at the dog parks in my city. If my dog is running around playing, that's what a dog park is for. Don't tell me how to raise my dog and I won't tell you how to raise yours. Even if dogs start to get growly at eachother, I never interfere (unless it gets violent, which it never has). Let the dogs figure shit out for themselves. If my dog doesn't like something, it will tell your dog and vice versa. That's how I see it. There's a lot of dog park hate on this thread I see haha"

relationship_advice,f95yuvn,t3_e3zyi4,1575137326.0,"I encourage you to read the book The Self Love Experiment by Shannon Kaiser. In fact, if you will read it, I will buy you a copy and send it to you. You're in a cycle. Once you lose the weight it will be something else. ""I don't actually like my nose"" ""I don't like boobs, if they were bigger THEN I would be happy with myself"" ""Once I make this amount of money THEN I can finally be happy"". It can even go onto personality traits. ""If I was more confident, then I will be happy with myself"". It will never end. The fact that he doesn't want to be intimate with you because of your weight is straight up sick. He knew who you were when you got together and as far as I'm concerned, you take people as they are and do nothing but support and encourage. That will never change in him. All you're doing is giving him power over you to make you change if he doesn't like something. This is much bigger than just your weight and it will escalate if you let it.

dating_advice,f95wy2g,t3_e3zyo0,1575136519.0,"One thing I have learned about this kind of stuff is, it's better to find the answers for yourself than try to get advice from others. Relationships are all different and each have their own dynamics. Without someone being in it, they can't truly know what it's like. Then they give some half assed answer about ""oh don't worry, you're too young!"" If you're at all like me and need others advice to form a decision, look for people who have no stake in it. Non biased. People in their 20s think they know everything."
AmItheAsshole,f95w0wp,t3_e3zyt1,1575136150.0,"YTA - I play MTG. I play commander. You are being an asshole. The more people who want to play, the better. If you're having a big event then they can play with other people too. Just because they aren't as fast as you are doesn't mean they should lose out on the opportunity to play with friends. Even when they take that long, everyone still gets a turn. You are prioritizing gaming over hanging out.  Not to mention, MTG is a strategy type game, especially in commander when you're not just worried about one other player but 4 of them. Turns take longer. 10 mins for sure is a little excessive but shouldn't strip someone of their ability to play with friends and do their best. Maybe make it like chess where there's a timer per turn. Maybe 3 mins per turn. That way it applies to everyone and you're not singling out one person."
