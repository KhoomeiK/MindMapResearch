DebateAnarchism,fpmvdxz,t3_ge4fby,1588742773.0,"I think ""pure"" capitalism would let a company die instead of handing them a bailout even if it meant less profit.  As it is now if a company has a big enough impact on the country and can't survive, it's the citizens paying for that companies bail out.   Now we could all buy shares of public companies and vote out management if we liked the company enough or we could leave it alone and let it die or survive if other people like it and support it, but you have to remember people are mostly greedy and don't care about anyone else which is why bailouts continue as far as I understand."
