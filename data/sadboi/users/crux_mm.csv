They waited a day because they wanted to watch the Absolution, a ritual that the city does to enslave soldiers of opposite armies, and enrol then as Resigned (a specific cast in the city system).


Unfortunately, they didn't know that the Rebel sect had an half-assed plan to riot (but they were unsure), as the city would reach the expansion number (I still don't know what that is, it just came to me). So the players thought to make one cypher to explode to interrupt the ritual, as they didn't want Od'Ubra to become more powerful..effectively starting the riot."

psychotherapy,f9c9y08,t1_f9c1h9f,1575221049.0,"They're asking because the issue seems much more related to your supervisor, than the actual laws and ethics. Maybe it's based on your supervisor core beliefs and values, not to the actual reality. 


I would advise you to check the BABCP website on https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=http://www.babcp.com/files/About/BABCP-Standards-of-Conduct-Performance-and-Ethics-0917.pdf&ved=2ahUKEwjFzICu-pTmAhWLZd8KHRLzC7wQFjABegQIAxAB&usg=AOvVaw17HQBVChR0i8Zer8WhmRik

For the actual guidelines.


While I would suggest you to talk to your supervisor and her some readings to do about this, I am 110% sure that you won't find anything related to this on the BPS, HCPC, BACP, UKCP, BPC ethical guidelines. I belong to all but BPC, and teach using their framework in different colleges, so I'm fairly certain.

psychotherapy,f98b50n,t3_e40ls2,1575176139.0,"Your supervisor is utterly wrong.


You should only report for abuse on vulnerable adults, children, suicide, homicide. There should be a high probability of it happening as well.


It's saddening that a supervisor is asking you to be a sort of vigilante for the law. It's wrong and totally against the principles of mental health therapies.

Somehow you're betraying her expectations, and this is distressful. Be clear with her, enquire regarding her expectations about you and show her what you're really up to. 


Another way woul be for you to facilitate her getting professional help. Trauma is vicious and gets in every cranny of people's lives.
