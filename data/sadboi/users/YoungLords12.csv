Meditation,fltjpce,t1_fls3z6b,1585475820.0,"Meditation is to simply be. To observe. Not get caught up in your feelings or thoughts like most people do throughout the day. It's to be still and observe your feelings and thoughts without labeling them as good or bad or anything else. It's to accept your feelings and thoughts as they come without judging them. So you can say meditating - is essentially doing nothing. You're literally doing nothing. Simply watching your feelings and thoughts. 

I have dealt with alot of anxiety/depression and stress in the past. And I have tried many different forms of meditation. I started off counting my breaths, body scanning, listening to high frequency music as I lay still, but i found that none of them gave me the same level of peace or calmness that being still and observing gives. And I think any form of meditation is good because you're putting time asside to focus on yourself, so even if you're not doing it the ""correct"" way, eventually you will. 

I don't believe theres a right or wrong way to meditation because any form of meditation is leading you to self discovery. But ultimately, your goal from meditating is to disassociate with your feelings and realize that thoughts have no power over you, therefore you dont need to feed them (if this is not what you seek from meditation then you are not meditating - perhaps pondering, overthinking etc) although it can be tricky sometimes because your mind will convince you otherwise by giving you strong sensations that make you feel like there is importance behind these thoughts. This is where the majority have trouble with even when they meditate. But keep practicing and you will slowly but surely find that inner peace and calmness. Just be still, close your eyes and observe... as the universe slowly opens itself up and reveals all its secrets."

Imagine you had a cut on your leg and you're thinking ""why did this happen to me, why does it hurt, what did I do to deserve this"" this is suffering, you're not accepting that it will heal by itself - by accepting it the pains still going to be there but no suffering. But with mental health we dont see the cut, so we treat it differently. In a nutshell, depression/anxiety is your body being super sensitized due to many reasons, but you treat it like that same wound. Although depending on how long you've had your depression/anxiety and how long you've been putting yourself through hell, the cut can be deeper and take longer to heal. Trust the process, your body is a fucking healing machine, just fuck off and let it do its thing. :P"

depression,flckt09,t3_fo0e5e,1585034849.0,"The reason people fall into depression is because of bad habits with overthinking and feeding your thoughts/feelings. Sometimes it's due to PTSD, trauma of sorts, abuse and other times it's just due to you being an over thinker. The latter was me. And one thing you have to realize is that taking medication does nothing with the way you think or the way your mind works, it suppresses the symptoms. Part of overcoming depression/anxiety is accepting your symptoms as awful and debilitating as they may seem. I dont mean to sound condescending but if you genuinely want to overcome your depression then you need to realize it's not just going to happen by you eating pills. Trust me. Whether you choose to try to understand what I say or brush it off because you've been taught differently or think somehow your case might be different, it's up to you, stubbornness is unfortunately also a part of depression and many mental illnesses."

Anxiety,flavut0,t3_fnpjqk,1584992160.0,"Yes, panic attack is a huge increase in fight or flight. Which is alot of adrenaline. Adrenaline makes your muscles tight and certain senses are increased a shit ton to help you fend off the dangerous situation or flee from it. In this state you are much more keen at noticing little things in your body, like your heart rate for instance. Your heart is fine. I convinced myself I had 10 heart attacks during my recovery from anxiety. At one point I went and got all heart checks done, all came out great. Part of anxiety recovery is getting over the health scares, constant mind telling you that you had a stroke, perhaps that blemish on ur skin is cancer etcetc. When these thoughts come, accept them, doesn't mean they are true but you will take away its power on hurting you and making you obsess and further stressing your body. So if your mind tells you that the quick heart pumping uoure having is a heart attack, say "" okay fine, so it's a heart attack"" in a sense... from my experience. I think the suffering and fear of panic attacks was worse than death or any other health scares such as heart attacks etc. Its an illusion of the mind, and it uses feelings to convince you. Dont fall for it. Let it be and accept. It's an illusion.... none of the issues you get from anxiety even prolonged are life lasting. So relax. Your IBS, Insomnia, tight muscles, chest pain all will fade as you learn to accept these feelings and stop fighting or resisting them."
Anxiety,flav6nc,t3_fnn3ir,1584991772.0,"Let me say... the benefits of meditation go way beyond this. I try to meditate for 2-3 hours a day ( 50 mins morning, mid day and night). I feel as thought I am a different person after I meditate vs before. It allows your body to go into calm state which reduce the tension that your tight muscles cause are your neck/shoulder/chest/back and more easily allows blood to flow because the muscles arent so tight and constricting blood flow to the brain. Kind of off track but I believe prolonged stress causing the constriction of blood flow to certain parts of the brain is what causes dementia and many old age related problems. When blood flows nice and freely to your head in this calm state, your memory will be much better (I started remembering things from childhood vividly that I never remembered before), and your concentration and focus will increase ten fold. All I can say is for me it feels like a super power because so few know how to do it properly and so few actually do it. It's not a over statement when I say it will change your life in ways you cant even imagine."
depression,flauiev,t1_fl8l77u,1584991390.0,"Very well said. In a nutshell it's you living in your head rather than being in present (reality). You just have to realize that what's happening in your head might feel important and very real but in all actuality it is irrelevant and noise that you should learn to simply observe. Almost like you're watching strangers walking on a side walk, you don't judge each one or go up to them and try to understand them. You simply observe without judgement of good or bad."

depression,flansqq,t1_fl9jdrf,1584987543.0,"You dont need to like it and the purpose of letting the sadness or bad feelings come over you is not to make yourself feel better. Its simply to stop trying to fight the feelings. Letting all the thoughts and feelings come over you isnt to stop the pain, it's to stop the suffering. 

Suffering is a choice. You can feel pain and have terrible thoughts (both have no power over you and are meaningless, despite the feelings they bring and how real it may feel) however it's your choice how to react. You can sit and wonder and try to rationalize/solve why you feel the way you do (suffering). Or you can simply allow the sadness and feelings to be, you're not suppose to like it but in a sense... it's simply throwing in the towel and saying you're done trying to fix yourself. 

The recovery from any mental illness stops with realizing that although you cant control the thoughts that come or the feelings they may bring, you control the reaction (feeding them by commenting in your head or trying to ""fix""/solve) and this reaction is the difference. It's hard because sometimes the feelings are overwhelming and grab you by the neck but itll get easier and easier not to feed these thoughts. 

I've been there. I've felt what u felt. I've questioned people and thought my situation was different and I cant recover with this sort of mindset, but here I am. The hardest part of recovery is realizing that it's simple, it isnt overnight, it has ups and downs - but you accept that and you move forward. Anytime you catch yourself overthinking or feeding your thoughts or pondering about why you feel the way you do, remind yourself that your body will heal by itself. And that you dont need to do anything, except not feeding your thoughts (making your depression stronger)."
depression,fl7ic3p,t3_fn1suz,1584902335.0,"Because you're suffering. You are suffering because you are in pain. You are in pain because you are resisting. Resisting the feelings of depression. The feelings of hopelessness, worthlessness and loneliness. All very familiar feelings to anyone with depression. Know that these feelings dont mean anything. Although they can be crippling, they are just feelings. They dont mean anything, so stop the suffering. Stop questioning why you feel the way you do, stop pitying yourself - there is nothing wrong with you besides the fact that your body has become sensitized from feeding into your feelings and thoughts. Learn to be okay with feeling like shit, you dont have to like it but stop the vicious cycle of suffering. And slowly you will see how your body heals and you find joy in life again. Good luck"
depression,fl6he7a,t1_fl6fwdw,1584868972.0,"I was diagnosed with anxiety and panic disorder. So I dont mean to sound like a dick when I say that I know exactly what you feel, and the things I say can and should be practiced. Regardless of how strong a feeling is it doesnt mean anything, the reason you feel strong feelings is probably because it's something you have thought alot about and it's made your body hyper reactive to it. Almost as if it's in danger anytime that thought comes. As far as anxiety goes especially general anxiety, this is you fearing anxiety itself. Fear is fear, you can feel fear however what I mean by not identifying with your feelings is not to reduce the feelings or look past it, but rather it's to view it as just a feeling... an overwhelming feeling that is uncomfortable and scary but just a feeling nonetheless. And I know when you have a panic attack or are an anxious mess it can cloud your thinking, logic and take away from you feeling any sort of normality. But your mind learns through action, when fear comes similar to how if a tiger lunges at you (in this case it can be a thought or feeling that sets off an anxious feeling) you simply be, allow it to do what it does, allow the fear to come, you dont need to like it, but simply let it do what it does. And then do what you would be doing if the anxiety wasnt there. You dont need to do anything about the anxiety, it just like any feeling goes away by itself. As you disassociate with your anxiety and realize it's something that will heal in time, you will heal. Your nervous system right now thinks anxiety itself means danger so it gives more anxiety, rather than you being in danger and anxiety kicks in with fight or flight to help you fend off or run from the dangerous situation. Stop your nervous system from reacting to anxiety by letting it be. This is how you retrain your brain and stop the vicious cycle of anxiety. Trust me. Been there done that. 

Ps before you say each case might be different which is something I often here (also thought this myself). It isnt, fear is fear, anxiety is anxiety, the source doesn't matter. If the source did matter, we would have sub labels for anxiety and their source, same with depression. Trust me bro. Forget everything you think you know about anxiety. Search acceptance and realize that literally all you have to do to overcome anxiety is to give up trying to fix yourself. Or thinking there is something wrong with you. You're just sensitized. Itll heal, your body is a machine at healing."
depression,fl6ew64,t3_fmtm8u,1584865697.0,"That's because you're seeking some sort of comfort from them. You want to feel like you are of value, you want to be reminded because in your current state you dont value yourself. Stop seeking validation from people and building your value based on your financial/social situation. You will never find happiness if that's what you value yourself through, because people will never live up to your expecration and they will always let you down. They dont owe you anything, let that set in and truly believe it. Instead rather than focusing your energy outwards, focus on yourself. Learn to love yourself by listening within. Meditate and learn to observe your feelings and thoughts and you will see how your mind has fooled you for so long. And once this truth becomes apparent... well you will see how the things you were chasing are now right in your palms. 

PS. I know it seems like I tried to sound super cliche, but I really mean it. You will attract all that you want in life when you focus your energy within. Law of attraction is one of the many truths that the universe will reveal to you as you focus within. Goodluck"

In truth, only you can make the choices and changes to overcome your current state. It is difficult but it gets easier. The reason your seeking help is because your suffering, and you want it to stop. Totally understandable, but ask yourself why you're suffering. In your response if you mentioned your thoughts or feelings, then there you go. You are simply resisting, your body is in full stress/depress mode because you're resisting the feelings of depression. Stop. Give up. Your body can heal without you trying to fucking meddle with it. Let it heal. Stop obsessing over why and how you feel, it's a natural response from your body and you reacting and stressing about why you feel that way makes it stronger. So stop. It's ok to feel like shit. You dont have to like it or pretend to be having a great time. But accept it, like a cut on your leg. Go through your day and slowly you will see the wounds heal."

depression,fl64vzu,t3_fmp7nm,1584854535.0,"The happiness that you've been told all your life about is false. Its simply a dopamine rush that you get, that you want to last but it doesnt. Because it's simply a reaction from your nervous system, a reward system. It's great but chase it and you'll go mad and be miserable. The cigs, music, alcohol give you a dopamine rush, moments where you feel slightly less depressed because the dopamine clouds it.... until it fades and reveals what's underneath once more.

This isnt happiness. The true path to happiness is through inner peace. This means letting go of people, letting go of all judgements you have on yourself, letting go of everything. Not letting anything weigh you down because your value isnt built on a thing or a person. Instead the value you put on yourself comes from within. Loving yourself as you are, knowing that all the trials you've faced - including the journey with depression has made you who you are. A survivor, who's learning and doing his very best. Love yourself. Do that and naturally the world will fall into your hands in ways you wouldn't imagine."
depression,fl64g6j,t1_fl608qx,1584854127.0,"Well said, you cant control the thoughts that come to your head or the feelings they accompany. But you do however control the reaction, whether you feed it by adding/commenting on to it or you let it go by simply letting it be and slowly letting it go as if it were a stranger that you're observing walking on a sidewalk. Thoughts are like that. You give them power. Sometimes when we feed the thoughts too much (indulge in our negative thinking) we make them stronger and they bring a bigger reaction. So the best thing you can do for yourself is not to feed these thoughts, any thoughts to be frank. You thinking is a tool to problem solve, not dwell on things obsessively to the point it drives you mad."

Then continue what u need to be doing, similar to how when you get a cut on ur leg and it stings, but that doesnt mean u stare at it and poke it and reflect in sorrow as to why it happened and why it stings. Same can be said about mental struggles, the more you obsess and try to ""fix"" what you believe to be wrong with you, the more power you give and deeper the rabbit hole you go. I dont mean to say you should like how you feel when anxiety comes, but what I mean is to give up trying to do things to make it go away or ""fix"" yourself. Trust me bro, I've been diagnosed with depression anxiety and panic disorder, I know exactly how I sound and when you are in it it's very hard to be accepting towards someone saying all this ^ because it shatters alot of the misconceptions you have about anxiety. 

In an essence, anxiety/depression is fueled by overthinking and stress and other factors like PTSD. So taking meditation suppresses the symptoms so you feel more ""normal"" but realistically to truly overcome it and find happiness and I mean true happiness and peace, you need to work on what's happening in your head. No amount of medication is going to rewire how your brain works. I hope you can find the peace and happiness that I did!"
Anxiety,fkq1y9o,t1_fkpt7dr,1584427193.0,"Dont feel bad. Everyone feels anxiety, it's a normal response for us to get out of situations where we are in danger. But our lives are so stressful nowadays that thoughts and feelings themselves give us that danger response. First part of acceptance is realizing that it's a normal thing your body does. The reason it becomes overwhelming is when we start to obsess it and fear anxiety itself. That creates a snowball effect where anxiety gives you more anxiety because you've trained your mind to be afraid of anxiety. It sounds awful but it really does get easier and easier. Go through your life and do what you would be doing if the anxiety weren't there, the panic will reduce, the anxiety will reduce and slowly you'll become the best version of yourself... even better than the ""good old times"" that you probably reflect on when you're overwhelmed with anxiety.

One last thing. Everyone will go through a part of their life where they face extreme anxiety, you need to learn the skills to accept it and understand your mind. Just know that you're maybe facing this challenge sooner than others. Which isnt bad, if anything it's very good. Because many people that you will meet, will have faced these struggles later in their lives when they are 40+ and once they overcome it. They are left in happiness but also in regret that all their life they let the anxiety control them. Be accepting, you will have good days, you will have bad days, that's part of it all.

Literally one of the most under rated exercises."

Slowly you will heal your sensitized body as you stop stressing about how you FEEL"
