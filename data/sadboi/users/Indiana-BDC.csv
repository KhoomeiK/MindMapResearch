I was talking about the black market until like 2010. I know it was that year because my wedding was then and I was talking to a friend about how I wish I knew where the black market was now because I wanted a good camera for the honeymoon.

schizophrenia,f1muuao,t1_f1m7vqr,1569602619.0,I do get a lot of stuff done as long as it is busy work. Not the stuff I need to get done but other stuff. They upped my meds today lol so I went with 3 mg to 6 mg of Vraylar. Sucks I have a wedding that I am in tomorrow 2 hours away so going to do everything I can to rest up tonight and probably just repeat internally to myself to keep my mouth shut during the event.
schizophrenia,f1ku2mj,t1_f1kszxq,1569540520.0,Vraylar and trazadone for sleep. I just started it. Been on trazadone for awhile though and it’s hit or miss.
FORTnITE,f1g3mhr,t1_f1g2zqf,1569459180.0,You can just be a passive little bitch like yourself and let people take advantage of you. It’s a game but people playing shitty then play shitty right back since you can’t do shit to them in real life.
AskReddit,f1dasml,t3_d8txlt,1569378460.0,"My mom dated a new guy when I was 13 and they married when I was 15. He had a daughter my age. We hated each other for like 3 months after living together, enough where we had to go to family therapy.

Well my friend had his license first and drove me to school then I let her get a ride to since it was just like ten minute in the car with her. One day he asked if I wanted to skip, she said she wanted to skip too so we hung out and got high and went swimming. Parents both worked til like 6 pm so we were able to go back home at like 1 pm. He dropped us off she was talking about how she didn’t know I smoked and cool letting her skip with me. Then she said her dad smoked and let’s go see if we can find his stash. Went into bedroom and checking drawers and she found unlabeled video. Of course we both knew it was porn but she wanted to check. Was open, asked if I had sex before. She did once and I didn’t. She then asked if I wanted to and told me she was on the pill. 

So we had sex after school when our parents weren’t home for like 2 months straight then she got a boyfriend and she stopped. Then she told her boyfriend about us for some reason. Then they broke up and he told everyone at school that she fucked her brother. I actually was expelled from school by then but it got back to the parents and my mom had a talk with her and she admitted it to her but decided not to tell her dad the truth. Anyways her dad and my mom got divorced when I was like 20 so I haven’t seen the girl in like 15 years. Pretty much my mom told me not to do it anymore because could cause issue and don’t want a baby in the house. We hadn’t done anything for over 6 months so I just agreed."
AskReddit,f1d98yl,t3_d75fyg,1569377246.0,"I went to catholic school. Besides religion class everything legit. Went k-12 til 2001. Our science class taught evolution and there was nothing about God creating planets or anything in our science books. Pretty much theology stuff stayed separate.

My middle school science teacher was looney and told us when our sun went out we could nuke Jupiter and use it as a sun instead. Nothing to do with religion but just felt like telling someone."
suspiciouslyspecific,f0z53cv,t3_d7a2wj,1569086604.0,"As a former crack head you would be surprised the people who do crack and meth. Not all of them are dirt poor... lots of them are though lol. I had sold crack at an inflated price to people in upscale neighborhoods. Regular cocaine is harder to come by than crack and some will be okay with you just getting crack if you can’t find it. 

Also I worked at a bank at the time and I went on FMLA for health reasons and rehab during that time. I found out many of my coworkers had done or occasionally do meth."

schizophrenia,f0s9lk4,t3_d68jzw,1568901227.0,Just questions. You’ll probably be disappointed on how much you may built it up in your head. They really aren’t anything to worry about.
schizophrenia,f0s8zfj,t3_d6dcp9,1568900926.0,Not anymore. I used to but even seems like weed leads to episodes after the high wears off.
LateStageCapitalism,f0e5v1j,t1_f0e4yar,1568563579.0,My insurance doesn’t deny if you are on meth. I have been to the hospital on meth. They give you some paper work on the dangers of meth and tell you not to do it. Also won’t prescribe you anything that will interact badly with it.
sports,ez9c5s8,t1_ez975h8,1567778705.0,"My girlfriend goes to the gym 4 times a week and runs almost daily. She was leg pressing about 200 lbs and made a smart comment to me about it and I sat down and did ten of them and think I could have added a bit more weight. I don’t work out at all and have a desk job. The most cardio I get is shopping.

I don’t think she should have been bragging about 200 lbs anyway but I know absolutely nothing about the gym. I was just there for my monthly smoothie that is part of our contract and it cost 10 dollars more for two people a month so we went ahead and signed up together. I thought I’d sit in their sauna but there are always people in it so I stopped going. 

Our weight difference isn’t that much either she is like 130 ( I’m just guess, probably less but I’m not asking) and I’m 145 -155 with a gut."
schizophrenia,exw1i11,t3_cuj2qg,1566610639.0,"Seen that and it does suck and step in right direction and I hope you continue you to follow through on Monday. 


The secret to in patient is to say you are having thought of wanting to harm yourself. Not that I say you should abuse the system but I have before when I really did not want to go back home because I would have probably gotten into other legal trouble if I returned home. Though I didn’t want to harm others, I get confrontational and it would had led to that if anyone gave me the littlest reason to do so including the drive home.

Now being Friday there are usually not prescribing doctors in on weekends so you’d probably just be held on some light stuff over the weekend and attend some groups. Weekends in psychiatric at most places I have been have been mostly waste of time. It’s best to get admitted late Sunday evening/early on a Monday  so you can see the doctors Monday morning. It may be different on your area.

These places also tend to release a lot of people Monday morning when the docs get back so if you do have any thoughts of harm maybe Monday try again at one and bring that to their attention with a little more focus on that self harm."
UnethicalLifeProTips,exvi6uh,t3_cuig25,1566600129.0,"Not sure if same now with it being legal in so many places but back in 2004 I just asked my weed dealer if he knew anyone who anyone who anyone who would tutor me that would pretty much do it for me smoking them out. Mother fucker hooked me up with a faculty member. Assistant to a professor who met with me and we blazed and it was weird at first cause he kept wanting me to try this salt water taffy then I did and my mouth was dry as shit and it was like never ending and I realized I hadn’t brought a drink with me. Started out super awkward but ended up chill as fuck when I got over that awkward stoned part of what felt like five minute piece of taffy chewing. Dude pretty much rewrote my entire paper for me but was worth it. Like I wrote the script from Land Before Time XIII Journey through Mountain singing and shit and he turned it into much better We’re Back: A Dinosaur’s Story. I got like pretty much like a 170/200 on the paper when alone I probably would have got like a 100/200. It was one of those papers I had like 7 weeks to write and I waited til last weekend to do.

So ulpt ask your drug dealer for homework help lol they actually may know connections who may be inclined to help you"
PublicFreakout,exq0iqk,t1_exod2x1,1566496467.0,"I wish I would have known this in college. We had a Muslim on our Basketball team who would pray in the middle of the bus. He was a recent convert to and I am pretty sure he did it to annoy certain teammates and disrupt our conversations.

We had people who went to high school with him who said he wasn’t Muslim back then and was something he picked up in between high school and college ball.

On one hand it annoyed our coach which I also sometimes found humorous and my coach didn’t want to get heat for dissing on someone’s religion so but his tongue but you could see his face turning red from it and the anger just building up."
AmItheAsshole,exd1bn1,t3_cs0bfh,1566164774.0,"NTA.  I was in a similar situation was a lesbian sister who pretty much didn’t “need” to come out to most people and most would assume she was a lesbian if you spent more than 10 seconds with her or her girlfriend. They were both butch type lesbians. Kept telling her she should do it before my wedding is coming up to my moms side of the family that is Pentecostal. 

I wasn’t close to them other than my 2nd cousin who I had as groomsmen. My sister was super close to them though and never told them. So she brings her date to the rehearsal dinner and they walk down the aisle together or something because I allowed her girlfriend to be a groomsman because my wife had way too many bridesmaids and I was taking whoever I could get. My cousin groomsman had a big mouth and told his mom and got to that side of the wedding and 10 people don’t show up over drama of disapproving of her lifestyle. So we were out their dinner cost and gifts because she couldn’t come forward. Other than that I didn’t really care anyways but could have saved me like a grand in food. 

Oh and when they didn’t show up they sent my aunt who did show up with a two page letter on why they didn’t show up which I never read."
schizophrenia,ex10fu4,t3_cqzdvx,1565926967.0,"Try to overload your senses with other stuff. Headphones and music, lights on. It sucks but I figured out how to sleep with AC/DC and the lights on.  Sometimes the other stuff will just stop like your brain forgets that it was tormenting you with it. 

Oh and I thought there was a loud cricket chirping outside my window. I went outside and sprayed raid around, used a flashlight and couldn’t find it. Girlfriend and my neighbor can’t hear it so my mind made a believable audible and very annoying hallucination."
television,ewv4kzr,t1_ewtgo02,1565798518.0,"That is why I canceled it. Marco Polo ticked me off but I had time to get over it then they ended up doing to several others. The Marvel shows were why I stuck around for so long but so many of their originals that I liked ended too soon.

August 8th was my last day subscribed and I don’t plan to ever be back anytime soon. I didn’t replace it with anything and went back to watching shows like I did before Netflix.

I will be getting Disney Plus though. Maybe years down the line if I hear good things I’ll be back but it won’t be for a couple years until I even consider it."
pics,ewmides,t1_ewm0qr6,1565552387.0,Yup a big club with no toilet paper. Went the rest of the night with one sock on. It was a busy bathroom too but luckily I was drunk enough to laugh with the others who witnessed me taking off my shoe and sock to wipe my ass with. There weren’t paper towels or anything in that bathroom. Just one shitter with no door which faced the line of four urinals. So pretty much you are sitting there shitting and looking ahead to four people pissing.
schizophrenia,ewjystx,t1_ewhuxrs,1565474140.0,I got them also lol.
schizophrenia,ewcxaiy,t1_ewcw7jq,1565291716.0,"I even asked them if I stop accepting the unemployment then could we go ahead and start it and was told no because I knew I get it for a year but only have like 5 grand to draw out of it for 202 per week. Figured if denied I could start drawing out of it after. 
Guess my psychiatrist doesn’t know this because she said one of the pros was me having unemployment to wait on my SSD to hopefully help because she knew th reasons why I wouldn’t before was to lose my apartment. Plus I got some foreigner doing it that I couldn’t understand which also got me in a mood. The cops talked with my apartment landlady to see if it was for a welfare check and let them know they had the keys but cops left. So guess they don’t have a warrant or enough to come in yet so I’ll just avoid them until they do."
