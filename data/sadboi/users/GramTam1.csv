But if she feels she has tried everything else, maybe that is her last resort to get across to you what she doesn't like? How much do you get in trouble or cuss at your mom? That might be worthy of a slap, but it should be rare."
insaneparents,fos8yvc,t1_fos19yb,1588026144.0,Do you have anyone in your family that can help and intervene? Have you called your therapist and talked to her about this? Are you ok?

SuicideWatch,focyb6v,t1_focqi39,1587677485.0,"None, I'm sure. People use that like it's a way to ease what they said. Like, 'here is some nervous laughter so don't get mad at me please', kinda thing."
SuicideWatch,focxlbk,t1_fo9rl94,1587677210.0,That 'therapy' didn't help my mom or my sister and they still both completed suicide so I would not recommend it.
SuicideWatch,focf2yv,t1_fobrozc,1587670577.0,"Yeah, that is the fear of God talking out their mouths. Because everything does NOT happen for a reason. Sometimes it's other people's friggin free agency to be a monster or a jerk. Everyone has their time? That is no revelation - we all die. I just want my say in it. I don't want someone laying me out so everyone can stare at my shell when I'm not there. I don't want others sorting my stuff out, so I just make plans on how to handle that. A will, a trust, and such. Also, depression has run through my family like water through a sieve. When I was a kid it was so confusing to have a mom that slept all the time or walked around like a zombie. I ended up spending my life looking through genealogy to find out how far this sad see went.  I have learned a ton, but am well aware of the depression, the anxiety, and the misunderstanding so many seem to have of it. I try and read, watch videos from like the Polar Warrior and stuff so I remind myself that we are not alone and it is way more common. I have almost not been here a couple of times as well. It sucks. But I live for those moments of happiness even if it's small. Because that reminds me that the world does have color and that there are things that I find enjoyable. For me it's nature. People can be damned but I love the outdoors and animals. So I get out of here and go see it as much as I can. You have to find your thing, and it has to make you smile, even just on the inside. We are all different so thinking it should all be the same for everyone is lame and lazy. Find your thing and surround yourself with as much of it as you can when you can. Sometimes it doesn't get better, but it has moments of better and I live for that. I get this - be we are all different. Those people that mean well, I just avoid."
SuicideWatch,fo3m9tw,t1_fo3377k,1587489273.0,"Having come from a family that has mental illness and has had too many deaths, I have to say, it is worth finding someone that is trained to know how to respond responsibly and have resources and tools to help you. Would it be ideal if our friends and family could BE that for us? Yes, maybe, and no, definitely in many ways. Why? Because they are familiar and we have at least some investment in them getting to know us and care enough to stick around until now, right? But as several people have said here already, most people just don't have the skills or any wisdom or tools. So what do they do? They stare at you/us like a deer in headlights. Because literally they truly have no idea what is the right thing to say or do - they just don't know. So rather than screw it all up they say nothing. Make sense? In a way, their silence says more about their abilities to counsel and help than about you being crazy. I promise. Please, get out in fresh air and sunshine every day, even if for 15 minutes. I'm telling you, just connecting with the outdoors is grounding and reminds us how much larger the world we live in is and we are part of that. There is no answers in dying on purpose. There is no way for things to get better or to enjoy anything after that. But there is hope for things to be better by staying and giving a chance to counseling. Right now they even have crisis counseling that can be done online from your home - makes it even easier to reach out. How about not putting a date on something like this? No commitment to yourself that you feel you can't walk away from.  Just one day at a time it and get that fresh air in. There are lots of us that understand where you are more than you know. You aren't alone in this, no matter what your emotions are telling you. There are many of us out here that get it, get you, and get there are many ways to make life bearable, happy even, you just have to let seasons go by. Like nature, if you love Spring or Autumn you have to get through the cold and the heat of summer and fall. Hang in there, man."

SuicideWatch,f2t5bbl,t1_f2s8xps,1570390991.0,"From experience with family and mental illness, kids can feel this way even when nothing is going on, or very little. It may be critical to get he evaluated for chemical imbalances. Sometimes the right medication and a really good counselor can help her understand and get through this hard time she is feeling. She doesn’t have the maturity or life experience to know it may not be her. A caring sibling like yourself may be the key at home to supporting her going through that process and allowing her to feel she has a safe place to work through the changes she will go through and it’s not all roses. You are a good person for. Sting about her and her welfare and you should. Do you have parents that can help her get the help she needs without guilt or shame? Get a hold of her school counselor too so they can be a support to her. Thank you for being aware of her and being willing to walk this path she doesn’t understand either."
