I am a smoker, and I saw this chart and thought it might have some validity ... but I'm far from an epidemiologist and I also don't speak French: https://mobile.twitter.com/KlausKblog/status/1249048902495592450

If you don't mind, and have the time ... what do you think the end game of this will be?  You mentioned pharmaceuticals, but as far as I know, that's not a preventative approach.  Do you see a third and fourth wave?  Would everyone eventually be affected?  I did read the Science article on reoccurrence of the disease based on seasonality, but in my understanding, they didn't approach the issue of the reinfection being worse the second time.  If anything, some of their graphs predicted that a COVID infection would provide lifetime immunity to all coronaviruses. 

Also, it's been a couple weeks since your update and my (and many) countries are discussing reopening.  How do you feel now?  Any more hopeful?

Thanks again for your response.  I really appreciate your knowledge and insight ... and the time you took to explain the smoking thing to me.

Edit: I looked at that link I sent again, and besides the fact that it's a tweet and unverified / not peer reviewed, etc ... it also seems like a very low n number, considering the number of infected.  I guess I wanted a way to feel a little safer, since I'm still working."

It didn't seen like a big deal when we were just seeing each other on a weekends, but then we moved in together and it's been the roughest.  I did buy a white noise machine, and that worked for awhile, but fall came and his allergies kicked in, and now it's back full force.

Four nights in the last week alone, I've been up in the middle of the night for at least an hour after him waking me up, and all of those nights I slept the remainder of the night on the couch, which is less than ideal.  Two nights this week, I've gotten under 5 hours of sleep with me crying somewhere in the middle at least once.  

To say it's a problem is an understatement; this is quickly becoming unlivable.  And when I try to talk to him about it, he just says in a general way, ""I'll do better,"" but never makes any concrete changes or tries anything at all that might help.  I feel so disregarded - I can't help thinking that it's a reflection of how much he cares about me since he is willing to put no effort in to this and it's obviously so problematic for me.  Some nights, I'm so angry when I wake up, it's all I can do to not go downstairs and break something.  When this was a huge problem in the spring, he asked me to record him snoring because he didn't believe me - I was incensed.  Now that the problem is back, I'm almost ready to break up and move out.

So far, I've kept the Kyleena.  I've read so many stories about the side effects of getting it out as well .... and I'm not really in a position to go without birth control.  Honestly, I feel so trapped.  I, of course, don't know this, but I'm anticipating another four months of side effects if I were to get it removed, and things have just sort of leveled out ... I'm not sure I could do four months of side effects. 

As far as the hair, its actually leveled out.  Its slowly growing back, but it takes time.  What's stayed is the brain fog and the fatigue some days now, not all anymore, but some.  Sometimes at night I still panic and want to pull it out.  It's been a rough road.
