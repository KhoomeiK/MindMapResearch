One of us don't get to be with our parents around the holiday or we're not together... if you're looking for long term relationship, then better start now... and unfortunately--especially at this point at this age...

No matter the amount. 5% is just a stupid amount in comparison.

Anyone who thinks she should have made sure to get all of the things her child needed before dropping her kid off has never been in a situation where they need to check themselves into a mental health hospital to get help. 
I haven't been that bad off, but I have been worse off enough to know that in a state like that, you're not thinking about essentials, you're thinking about how you need to find help from someone so you don't kill yourself. And I'll tell you, the fear of losing her child is not going to help her. And it almost definitely will stop her from getting help in the future.

AmItheAsshole,f35wyxj,t3_dfp1yq,1570695283.0,"I know people who have gone in and out of foster care. One of them was abused more by her foster parents than by her actual parents. Her mom was an alcoholic and her dad sexually abused her, but both foster homes also abused her--sexually and otherwise-- and her and her brother (who she was often with in these foster homes) have times where they have no memory of their childhood because of these foster homes in addition to one faster home where they were drugged nearly the whole time.
My other friend was put in a foster home with a CPS lawyer. And there she was emotionally abused, her foster mom was incredibly controlling of her every action, she cut her off from friends, including me, because she believed we were a bad influence. And then she was finally, in the middle of high school, was placed with her aunt and uncle-- and even they were ill-equipped to have her. And didn't treat her well, but at least she was with family, and she calls her aunt 'mom' because it was finally a place where she could be with family.
The state provides you with assistance to provide child care and buy child-care supplies. People in this sub are right that if this was a question of someone dropping the kid off with you because your sister was going to 'a hospital' for a brain bleed, that there would be no doubt that you'd be the asshole for calling CPS without even taking a day to figure out what other options might be. But because it was her mental health--equally as serious and just as easily results in death-- somehow you're in the right to be so callous. It's a 3 year old. And who knows what trauma you've just subjected him to for the rest of his childhood. There are plenty of people all the time who have kids sprung on them.

Unfortunately, womens medical studies aren't looked into as much as mens or general medical problems, so there isn't enough information on IUDs, I think.
Also, in case you feel crazy... normal just means common--it doesn't mean its okay. If it isn't working for you, get it out. As I've said, I am on my second mirena IUD and I have loved every minute of it.

Down the aisle to their seats before going to the front. She could have her male friend join the bridal party so that you have ten, and have 2 girls and three guys on one side and 1 girl and four guys on the other. You could settle for only having your maid of honor and best man walk down ahead of you while the rest of the party is already up front. (I have seen every one of the options I listed at various weddings)

*TL;DR* There are a lot of ways you could change how your bridal party is presented that would allow each of you to have the people you want included. It's not that hard. And it doesn't have to be 'conventional'."
AmItheAsshole,f2e8pnr,t1_f2e5sso,1570186689.0,"It sounds like his bride isn't listening to what he wants, either; and isn't willing to compromise either. He has expressed that having his friends there for him is important and she took it personally, like he was trying to slight her for not having enough friends. She even turned down a suggestion he made because it was 'unconventional' and made no offer herself other than him just cutting out three people."
AmItheAsshole,f2e83v5,t1_f2cvx92,1570185896.0,"Isn't she also unwilling to compromise, though? She doesn't want her male friend to be in the bridal party because its unconventional.
Wouldn't another entirely valid option be that he gets to have all of his groomsmen be in his wedding party and the have the procession be different than what's 'conventional'
My *bridal* party consists of my sister, my brother, and my guy friend, my fiancee's consists of two of his childhood friends. It seems to me that the fiancee is unwilling to break away from tradition so that her fiancee can have the guys who mean a lot to him by his side on the day he gets married.
Edit: also, it's *his* wedding day too."

relationship_advice,f2e6kjb,t1_f2dvhaj,1570183686.0,"I also think it might be a good idea--at least to tall to your therapist about it-- to invite each of your parents individually to a therapy session. This way you can tell them how you feel in a safe environment, and your therapist can help you understand/process your parents' point of view. There might be something they say that could help you wrap your head around everything that has been going on. I think one of the biggest roles played in all of this is the time of your life that it all happened. 12-15 y/o is a hard time without anything extra. All of that being said. It is very important for you to know where your line is drawn, and don't do anything for their emotional benefit at the detriment of your own. You come first."

AmItheAsshole,ezy87jg,t3_d2uish,1568260778.0,"NTA. I think people need to understand that you dont have to stop loving one person to love another. You're not wrong for always having a place in your heart for this girl you might have had a future with, whose life was abruptly cut short before you could find out. You're allowed to memorialize her while still loving your wife, and your wife seems to be a little insecure. Maybe you should talk to her about it to explain that you still love her as much as you always have, but that she should at least respect the mourning of this girl who you also loved. And maybe ask her, if she died, would she want you to remember her after her death? Or would she like you to forget her when you get a new wife?"

AskReddit,ex1erfa,t1_ex0bpld,1565941984.0,"Historically there are certain cultures that are more tolerant of alcohol than others, and less addicted. People in London, for example, were more likely to survive diseases--especially waterborne ones--if they drank more alcohol than water. Therefore, those who drank alcohol, and tolerate drinking more alcohol (because of an enzyme in their gastrointestinal system) carried on to produce offspring. If you are from a family that was historically in a less populated area, you're less likely to have that familial tolerance because your family didnt die from diseases that, in populated areas, you had to drink alcohol to avoid."

AskReddit,ex1aunp,t3_cqx1hs,1565937258.0,"I never like when I'm anything more than a mild buzz. I feel pukey, my face heats up, I get a headache my joints hurt, and then I'm miserable he next morning, even if is only a little alcohol. Additionally, I hate feeling like I'm not in complete control of my body.
That's why I dont drink and that's I tell people. That way, if someone continues to pressure me I can identify that they're a shitty person. Cause a non-shitty person doesn't pressure someone who explains that they're in that much pain from drinking."

FriendshipAdvice,ewds536,t3_cnn0sv,1565306482.0,"It sounds like sister-in-law is already set in stone. So if your friend asks you if you can be in her wedding party you say ""I can't do it that day because I already have prior obligations"".
Because ultimately it was your friend who scheduled the wedding on the same day as your sister in law. But going back on your sister in law will rock the boat more than telling your friend you can't be there. If your friend can't understand that you have prior obligations with family that you can't back out of, then she's probably not a good friend anyway. And if she really wanted you there--especially if her venue isn't booked--and it sounds like it isn't? Then she'll choose a different date. 
That's what I would do in this situation for m best friend if I were her."
