Of course, the cost of that 'fame' was doing the most embarrassing crap you can possibly imagine; I suspect, like everything else, I can't even remember 99.99% of it, but I'm sure everyone else does. As such I was in the head of year's office every single day for the first year, although I only actually remember going in once.

My dad made DAMN-SURE I failed school and dropped out of college. Starting at age 3, he routinely ""showed"" me I was useless and too stupid to learn by quizzing me on stuff I didn't know, and then raging at me for getting it wrong. In hindsight, his intentions are clear, but when you've been raised with that, you're left with no choice but to genuinely believe it.

In my experience: I'd received so many negative messages about myself that, when I FINALLY started getting positive messages from mentally-healthy people around age 19, they simply bounced off. My 'Job Coach' was flabbergasted that I genuinely had no dream job and no ambition; I had absolutely no answer for the question ""Where do you see yourself in 5 years?""

It took me a LONG time to recover on my own. I left my dad at 17, and I didn't even start trying in life until 25. Being away from my dad really helped me heal; if I got therapy when I moved out I might've had a much faster recovery."

This bully kept saying he was my best friend (often using the phrase ""I'm your best friend, not him!"") until I accepted it. I was also very used to abuse so I was never totally put off by it. Around age 9 he bullied me into staying over at his house every single weekend, which continued until I was 17.

During these sleepovers I'd be starved while he ate constantly in my sight, insulted me almost non-stop, deprived me of sleep, kept me bored, occasionally physically abused me, and I'd be a first-hand witness to his and his mother's daily psychopathic fights. They were amusing at first and in school we'd all laugh about it, but after the first year they were just draining.

I had an actual best friend who was toxic at the time, but not a narcissist. Shortly after my 17th birthday my Emom and I left my Ndad, which threatened my bully's control over me. As such, he got me into WoW so he could continue to bully me despite me moving away.

Eventually I quit WoW, got Xbox Live and reconnected with my actual best friend. My bully gave up pretty much immediately, likely knowing it was now game over.

It's important you understand that you're not responsible for anything she may do as a result. She needs professional help or she'll never get better - but that is her decision to make. As for you, she'll make short work of any recovery you make if you keep contact.

Your mother has groomed you to become the carer from an early age. She has indeed robbed you of your life, but you can get it back, starting with cutting her out. You need to learn to be selfish - selfishness is good, to a degree. If everybody was totally selfless, everyone would be trying to feed each other but refusing the food they're being given so others would have more to eat. We'd all die. Alternatively if we're too selfish (like your mother) we'll destroy everyone else. There's a happy medium.

It'll take a while to figure yourself out. I highly recommend you start with therapy, because that's when my recovery truly began - only I waited 9 years after leaving my dad to see a therapist. 9 years largely wasted wallowing in my mental anguish.

My dad one day decided that I was going to become his carer. I was 16 when he called me downstairs and said ""Son, when you turn 18 you're quitting college and becoming my registered live-in carer so I can claim more welfare."" He was fraudulently claiming disability welfare while working. That carer money would be rightfully mine, but LOL, every penny in our house went on his beer, and my mother and I got the change.

If I'd stayed, my life would've consisted of getting him another beer from the fridge; driving out to get him more beer; and taking his abuse. Thankfully my dad suddenly intensified his abuse towards my mother and she (finally) decided to escape when I was 17, and I went with her."

Just as my conditioning was breaking, I remember on my grandmother's birthday we had a meal with a couple she knew, and went out to a nearby town to look around the shops. It was a decent-enough day and probably the most fun she's had in a while.

We were heading back when my grandfather asked her ""Which is the best road to take to get home quickly?"" There was an elongated pause before she answered, by which time we'd pulled up on the wrong lane.

""For f\*\*k's sake, \[grandmother\]!"" he yelled, as he reversed and changed into the correct lane - on an empty road (so it's not like there was any reason to be even slightly stressed). You could feel my grandmother's spirit deflate.

The main ingredient of success is: Finding what you **want** to do. Otherwise, you'll haul yourself to interviews for jobs you don't want, and the interviewers will pick up on that. The way I found what I wanted to do was by making a list of everything I thought I'd enjoy, and narrowing it down to just one option. I then applied to college for it.

There was a lot to learn and it seemed like it'd be too much hard work, but I found myself interested in the subject. Learning it isn't a chore because I want it. As such I'm the top of the entire group of students, and I've won two student awards.

Most interestingly: During my work experience week, I impressed my employer so much he wanted me for two weeks! Now, after all of my failed half-hearted interviews, I could never have imagined any possibility that I'd ever in my time on this earth impress an employer. But there it was. And I didn't even consider what the employer might've thought of me, I was only interested in getting real-life experience of the work.

Around this time last year, I was praise-thirsty. I just wanted someone to absolutely bury me with compliments which I was convinced would heal me, even though I had this nagging feeling that it wouldn't be enough.

Well I got my wish anyway. I had a substitute teacher take my English speech. She applauded me, told me I was a really good person because of the content in my speech; said I was a great orator; praised my writing abilities; told me I could go far in life. She did all of this in front of a class of people.

I laughed it off. After all, she couldn't possibly have meant it. If only she knew whom she was praising. She couldn't see the depths of my inherent and irreconcilable worthlessness, and that's why she praised me.

In reality: My core beliefs, created under the conditions of my abuse, were being called into war to annihilate her compliments. It was like saying to a religious person ""There is no God"" - what do they do? They automatically defend their beliefs.

My grandmother's father was really nasty to her (he died only recently), always commenting on her weight, and I think that's why she stomachs any-and-all nastiness from my grandfather.
