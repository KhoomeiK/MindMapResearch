One particular instance always stands out more than others. He was just over a year when my grandmother passed away. He was 2 when we visited her grave before moving to a different state. Last summer we drove by a cemetery and my son, 5 at the time, pipes up with “remember when we went there but near paps house and mommy cried at the ground?” I was pretty taken aback by it. He still
Does this, with the most random memories. I think it’s common in kids, though."

TooAfraidToAsk,fimtbr0,t3_f8ibt1,1582546184.0,"Some therapists work on a sliding scale so what you pay is based on your income. The lowest I’ve personally seen the scale go is $20. Even $20 once a week can be a huge burden to a lot of people, though. While weekly sessions may be recommended, you don’t have to go weekly. I always broke my therapy sessions down to once a month. With my insurance, my co-pay is $25 and $25 a month is much more doable than $25 a week. There’s also some places (not many) that do free counseling. I think my local health department has this. Might be worth looking into if you really need the therapy.

My self esteem and confidence issues do not stem from my husband. Sure, at some points it’s been easy to blame him because he’s closest to me. But they are much deeper and started long before him. The small period where I gained some self esteem wasn’t because he was absent. It was because of therapy. I’m currently back in therapy, and getting there. His porn issues, well, they have a starting point as well, just like every addiction does. He’s also currently in therapy, and I’m just happy we are finally making this much progress. 

I’ll check that out, thanks!"

loveafterporn,exusy0p,t1_exuq7ag,1566587966.0,"Porn doesn’t degrade or dehumanize women for being porn. There is such thing as degrading porn, but it’s all acting. It’s actors/actresses most of the time. Watching or not watching porn has nothing to do with one’s ability to be a feminist. Those people make money. 

I agree with you. I don’t need to rationalize or justify his behavior, and i refuse to. He knows how I feel about it, and he is actively in the process of breaking addiction. He IS willing to stop. That was the point of this post. Addiction is a lot more than just “ok I’m gonna stop this now.” It’s work. It’s a process. It’s taking steps to beat it. It’s accepting that mistakes will be made on the road to recovery. It’s taken me a LONG time to accept the porn thing as an actual addiction, but after reading the science behind how porn effects the brain, it helped shift my perspective. For a long time I did treat it as something someone could just stop. Like, it can’t be that hard to just not look, right? Except, it is. And I had to really look at my past addiction as well (not drugs for anyone curious) and compare the two. I couldn’t just stop, either. I wasn’t addicted to porn, but the science and brain activity was similar. I’m going to support him in his journey to being a better him as long as he’s putting in the work, which he is. I also had to really, really do some soul searching to get to the bottom of my feelings about it. It’s been a long road for the both of us, and I’m not going to leave my husband for a porn addiction as long as he’s putting forth the effort to recover."

4 peaches cut in half. Combine about 1 cup honey, 1 tablespoon vanilla, and 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon in a bowl or ziploc bag. Add peaches and let marinate for at least a few hours. Grill the peaches to desired done-ness. You can also drizzle the leftover marinade over the vanilla ice cream! 

This was a recipe out of a grilling recipe book my dad bought probably 20 years ago. You can also add strawberry preserves to the marinade, or any flavor preserves if you want."

Spirituality/religion is very personal. There is nothing wrong with using “witchy” stuff in your relationship with God/Jesus. I met a Christian witch that said she feels closer to God when she’s using tools such as crystals because according to her belief system, God made crystals.

It’s also usually worse when I’m not busy. 

If you’re able to be like “ok when I start feeling like x, I need you to support me by doing x.” with your closest friends and family, that might help them feel less frustrated and might help you feel more able to talk to them. I really only go to my best friend, my aunt, and my husband, so they’re all very used to it. Sometimes they get annoyed, but they still offer some form of support.

My best usually calls me a psycho and says I’m not dying.
