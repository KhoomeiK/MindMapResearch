SuicideWatch,fpdkhan,t1_fpdi711,1588528768.0,To answer you what led me to this point I’d say that I lost my will to live and I realized years ago that I’m truly a horrible person. I’m greatly simplifying my reasons but if I didn’t I’d write a 10 page essay. I can’t live with myself and 2 many horrible things has happened for me to come back to this world.
SuicideWatch,fpdgu39,t1_fpdgaah,1588526718.0,I just can’t go on. I’ve disappointed myself and the only other person that ever cared. I’ve held on for 4 years and each day has been worse than the previous one. I’m in such a bad place and situation that there is no other way out even though I tried. I truly wish there was another way out and I’m so happy for you and the fact that you finally got out of that dark place but there is just so much a person can take. Thank you for caring though :)
SuicideWatch,fp52vp4,t3_gbchbv,1588314555.0,"I’ve reached that point a few days ago and it’s like the world stops and you realize that you have officially died on the inside. I tried for the longest time to build this barrier (as in not reach the point where I’m not afraid/don’t care) but it just didn’t work.

This might sound harsh and negative but I don’t want to give false hope so hear me out. I don’t know your story but if you don’t get help soon these feelings will suck you deeper down the black hole to the point where there is no return. I tried to stay alive for 4 years so that i wouldn’t give my mom (the only person I care about) any heartache after I’m gone but a few days ago when I was researching ways to die (which is not the first) I finally found my way out and I suddenly felt relieved. I’m gonna go through with it soon so I beg of you to do something about your situation otherwise you’ll become like me and many others and you can not turn back on your own (well you can but it wouldn’t be easy). I do really wish you the best but I can’t promise that things will get better cause I hate it when people that don’t understand me tell me to “ignore my feelings and live”. 
Hope this helps somehow."

SuicideWatch,fj1zopx,t1_fj1v7r7,1582931374.0,"It's hard for me to just get out of my bed and clean myself up and i have had a theory that I might be clinically depressed mostly because I have about 98% of the symptoms that align with depression but I've never been tested or formally diagnosed. The reason I'm saying all this is because I've never been introverted before this depressive episode came 4 years ago and have always been positive and social before that.

I have tried other things to pass the time like going to the gym because I love sports and general things that have to do with movement but I have been going there on and off for since my depressive episode because I would become 2 unmotivated to go there and sleep for days instead. I've also spent 3 summers at home and maybe left the house 3 times in 2 and a half months so the change in my personality is very drastic.

I am trying to be more active and try new hobbies but because of my self hatred i almost always quit and think of myself as a failure.

Talking to others doesn't help either because people say that I'm being ""too depressing"" and a ""mood killer"" I'm truly stuck and have nowhere to go and I can't solve some of my problems either.

As for my self esteem, like i said it got worse with my depressive episode and is getting worse everyday. I have a hard time going around town and run errands without thinking of why people are staring at me. I know that they don't care about my existence and aren't even paying attention but subconsciously i still have this unsettling feeling. It's mostly me who's being mean to myself and punching down but others say the same thing so that must mean that I suck.

Oh well, It's just what i have to live with depending on how much energy i have left to deal with this cruel, selfish and unforgiving world."

SuicideWatch,fj1usvr,t1_fj1tj9i,1582928256.0,"I wouldn't say that I'm fetishizing death, even though it seems to be the easiest way out, I can't go through with it mostly because i know it would mess up my parents. It's a way to cope but I just get frustrated knowing very well that as long as my brain is in tact and my parents are alive, I can't just off myself even though that would be the easiest and most productive way to solve/get rid of my problems cause there is no hope for me with the state I am right now.

Thanks for the encouraging message :)"
SuicideWatch,fj1uagy,t1_fj1tequ,1582927924.0,"I'm currently 17 going on 18 and I'm a senior in high school. I used to love reading and taking long bike rides but i lost interest in everything a few years ago. It happened out of the blue. My self esteem plummeted around the same time which prevented me from going outside and do my daily cycling. I could barely get out of bed and failed most of my subjects despite being a ""smart kid"" that skipped a grade (weird flex i know). All i do these days is stay in my room either watching youtube or various other documentary/shows. I also have to put up this happy and stable front infront of people whenever I'm obligated to go to places like school or things along those lines and that usually takes away my mental strenght. 

In conclution i lost interest in everything and am 2 tired/hate myself to keep up with my past hobbies (with a hint of being suicidal)

There is a whole lot more to my story but then i'd have to write an essay about the past 4 years and ain't nobody interested in reading that."

depression,ffsy5iw,t1_ffswsb5,1580197399.0,"Oh man I would need to write an essay to explain the 4 years that led me to this point but to try to summarize everything. One day in the beginning of 2016 I realized I was the worst thing on earth and lost all will to live. My life was going ok and nothing happened in the past year to lead up to this. As the year went by I had several mini mental breakdowns and everything started to go south. My grades, my social life and everything else. In 2018 I realized that I truly had a problem because I was thinking about suicide every single day, I even started to plan my suicide by looking up easy and painless ways to die. Now I’m on my last semester of high school and I don’t care about anything. I’m not going to prom and I don’t even want to go to my graduation but I’m being kinda forced to go. I think that I’m going to fail anyway but I don’t care. I don’t want to do anything after high school and feel so sad all the time. I have no friends and if I’m not at school I’m always at home. 

It’s really unfair that I have to go on with a life that i didn’t ask for. If I got a terminal illness or got in a freak accident, I would want to die."
depression,ffswls0,t3_euxyam,1580195439.0,"Absolutely horrible

I sat all morning having what can be considered as a mini breakdown repeating ""i didn't ask for this life"" and ""i think i'm gonna do it"" over and over again. 

I have nothing to live for and want to die so so badly but i don't want to hurt my mom. I'm already a disappointment and don't want to give her a hard time but i feel like I'm gonna go insane if i keep on living another for another year. I wish i could tell someone or get help but i can't for various reasons so yeah..."
