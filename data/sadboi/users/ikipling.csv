I understand that you do it with a completely different intention. We received other comments too regarding this matter. Unfortunately, this is happening due to other variables included in the study and it is considered a limitation to the study."

StopSelfHarm,f1aycbp,t1_f19cz9l,1569313991.0,She will be so happy to hear that there is interest in her thesis! I am not sure exactly when it will be completed but I can post the findings to the group or the article if it gets published. However this will take some time for sure :)

Cutters,f0mlybf,t1_f0mdnir,1568747999.0,"Thank you so much for taking the time! I am sorry to hear that it was mildly triggering for you. I hope that you are feeling better now. If you are not, please let us know."
selfinjury,f05bhy2,t1_f051fpw,1568406154.0,That’s great! I am glad that there is interest around the world. Self-harm is a very important topic. :)
Cutters,ezz2zuk,t1_ezyal73,1568279552.0,"I am sorry to hear that you got this page. Thank you so much for taking the time though!

You are right, we do make a lot of thoughts every single day and it does not mean that we actually mean them. Unfortunately this is just a questionnaire and there are no open-ended questions for further explanation. So, I am glad that you wrote to me to explain. 

Counselors though should spend some time to discuss it with you further before calling the police… :( I know that they are following standard procedures to make sure that you are okay, but maybe, what you really needed was someone to actually hear you? :("
Cutters,ezz2n2w,t1_ezxywa9,1568279361.0,"As far as I know, some people who used to be religious chose to distance themselves from God as a form of self-harm punishment and that’s why this question exists. However, it is not applicable for those who are not religious. Thank you so much for taking the time! :)"
SelfHarmScars,ezz259b,t1_ezxkjbf,1568279110.0,Thank you very much for taking the time. :) We noticed from general feedback that the “how many times” questions were indeed problematic. My friend is informed about it and she will take it into account. Thanks for caring!
StopSelfHarm,ezycqf4,t1_ezxobsx,1568265380.0,Thank you so much for your time and for offering to help my friend further! I will definitely mention it to her.
AdultSelfHarm,ezx3clg,t1_ezwiho3,1568231133.0,"Thank you so much for taking the time! It seems that the questions regarding the number of times are quite problematic. I will pass it on to my friend, along with your note on religion. Thank you for your feedback. :)"
Cutters,ezw0wvi,t1_ezvxhye,1568204684.0,Thank you so much for your time! It is indeed not a very good question but it is a standard one in such studies. I will definitely pass on your feedback. :)
Cutters,ezvzuuf,t1_ezvtzlq,1568203709.0,"Thank you so much for your interest! I am deeply touched by your kindness and my friend is forever grateful to you.
You might not be old enough to participate but you helped us more than we could ever ask for! :)
If there is anything that we can do for you let us know!"
AdultSelfHarm,ezvxs6a,t1_ezvrlrx,1568201624.0,Thank you so much!! :)
AdultSelfHarm,ezvly14,t1_ezuqy79,1568183950.0,Thank you very much for caring! We already posted it to samplesize but unfortunately selfharm doesn't allow any surveys..
AdultSelfHarm,ezvlsuk,t1_ezumcdv,1568183747.0,"Great, thank you so much for your time! :)"
AdultSelfHarm,ezvls0d,t1_ezv9z0q,1568183715.0,"Yeah, that’s what my friend has been telling me, that self-harm is a way to regulate emotions. Thank you so much! I am passing everything to her."
AdultSelfHarm,ezvlov8,t1_ezuw7pd,1568183595.0,"So I spoke to my friend and she is so glad for all your feedback! Learning from you is like learning from the experts and she really needs that. She mentioned that unfortunately due to other variables included in the study she could not include all participants, but she will definitely mention this as a limitation to the study. She does recognize that life and behavior are much more complex than they are presented in research."
SelfHarmScars,ezvlhxb,t1_ezvl71g,1568183324.0,"Yes of course! I won’t let her know. I can post the results to the group or the link to the study once it is published. This will take some time though.
Thank you for taking the time :)"
AdultSelfHarm,ezucarp,t1_ezuad6o,1568149389.0,That's a very interesting point. Thank you for the feedback! I will pass it on to my friend and make sure that this is not the idea being perpetuated.
AdultSelfHarm,ezu7vy9,t1_ezu5l1a,1568147019.0,The question regarding history of suicide attempts leads to further questions. Only current thoughts of suicide lead to disqualification.. The study tries to stay focused on individuals who might engage with self-harm for other reasons and not for ending their life.Thank you so much for taking time to complete and comment on the study.:)
StopSelfHarm,eyirk1u,t1_eyi1uhp,1567106566.0,That’s a very good suggestion! Thank you very much. I will pass it on to my friend.
StopSelfHarm,eyh3zdh,t1_eyh0336,1567081521.0,"Hello; thank you so much for completing the study and for offering to help my friend further! I will definitely mention this to her. Your story sounds indeed intense but you should be SO proud of yourself for being able to work on it. I am glad that you had the support that you needed. Your experience means a lot and sharing it with others will definitely help other people. I am sure that even those, who helped you, have learnt a lot with you through your journey. 

I will give her a big hug from you and say “thank you”. She will be very happy to hear your appreciation."
StopSelfHarm,ey7yzo7,t1_ey7ymgo,1566906262.0,Thank you very much! I am sure that every response is very much needed and deeply appreciated! :)
