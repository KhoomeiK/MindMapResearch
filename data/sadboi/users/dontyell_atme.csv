PurplePillDebate,fql9488,t3_gj4mtx,1589450612.0," it‚Äôs part of the patriarchy‚Äôs goal to oppress women with denying them being sexual people. It‚Äôs reducing them to their sexual history and basing their worth to how they dress and behave, then saying they‚Äôre ‚Äûeasy‚Äú because that‚Äôs what empowers men, putting women down. The grotesque thing to me is, that not seldom women also do along with it, but those are ‚Äûpick me‚Äús who are insecure themselves. men are insecure because society tells them they‚Äôre superior to women so they try to do everything they can to try to control women, make them look inferior.


There‚Äôs a Wikipedia article  
‚ÄûMen with this complex desire a sexual partner who has been degraded (the whore) while they cannot desire the respected partner (the Madonna)‚Äú

AnorexiaNervosa,fp92i4a,t3_gc3lw8,1588411791.0,"TW
From underweight and hungry all the time to healthy weight and actually battling my problems instead of numbing them. 
Im still struggling some days, but it gets less and less. I was afraid of eating and now my hunger levels have evened out, I don‚Äôt binge and purge anymore and I‚Äôm not almost-fainting all day. 
My weight doesn‚Äôt determine my worth. 
When I see middle aged/old people dieting their whole life, even when they don‚Äôt have an ED like my mother, i feel awful. it hurts to see. I don‚Äôt want to end up like this, I want to be happy and have something else on my mind than food and losing weight. Seeing my mom and her friends complaining about their weight is an awful thing, all she does when eating is feel guilty. 
Being in the mental hospital helped, but my road to full recovery isn‚Äôt over yet. 

If you want to recover, I can tell you: it WILL be hard. It WILL take a few months to get used to your body.
But it‚Äôs definitely worth it. 
At least I for myself have decided I don‚Äôt want this disorder to dictate my life, I want to be happy and healthy."
