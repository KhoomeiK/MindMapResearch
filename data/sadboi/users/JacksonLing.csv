relationship_advice,flg3jwb,t3_fonbwq,1585129089.0,I don’t really know it could be my seasonal depression coming on or maybe a certain situation we had a while ago it’s been going on since dec January ish. We had a pregnancy scare had to take plan b and I felt really bad about it. I don’t think that’s it tho. She’s pretty rude she doesn’t mean to be but she can be really rude to me sometimes and I don’t think I like that. It makes me feel like she’s not the one for me and I don’t like it. I don’t really feel a lot for her anymore and I feel like leaving her but at the same time I still love her we’ve been through so much It’s just not the same.

depression_help,fki65ay,t3_fiiggo,1584212681.0,"Your stressed out, worried or scared. I know it’s not for everyone but you should probably take some time alone somewhere calming for you(for example I go in the woods and sit down next to my river) but just somewhere that helps you relax your mind. Then you should really think about who you are what’s going on in life with you right now think about why your stressed and how you can fix it. These dreams are your brains way of telling you that your upset about something. If this helps please let me know I’m always trying to help others feel better."
SuicideWatch,fkhx3cs,t3_fihlor,1584207603.0,Every one wants to be your friend until your broken then they don’t want to have to pick up the pieces. Even the people close to you who love you dearly will try to but it’s hard for them sometimes so they give up or just stop. It’s hard for me to talk to even the people who love me because I’m scared of losing them. Tbh I think my girlfriend is about to leave because of it I’m stuck and lost and I don’t know what to do with anything really. I could rant about this for a long time if you want to help me out and tell me how to post something on this sub reddit then that would be cool so I could have some people rant to me and help me with my ranting. Thank you all✌️
