TooAfraidToAsk,fctfhue,t3_eisqt8,1577941602.0,I'm 34 and still growing up.  None of us know what we are doing.  We're just doing our best to survive. Pay your Bill's. Be kind. Keep your word. Do what makes you happy (unless it's murder. Dont do that). Save your money for the things you really want. Travel. Be safe.

Example: that tube you spray to put the fire out.  

Fire extinguisher."
