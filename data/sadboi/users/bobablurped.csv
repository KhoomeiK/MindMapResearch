He (now that he says it) rarely ever reply to those kinds of messages in the group, but at the time, even though it was midnight, he texted me and we talked for a bit. For some reason, I couldn‚Äôt stop texting him. He‚Äôs the vice president of the community btw.

Then we decided to meet up, and our predicted 2 hour dinner became a 4 hour dinner where we went home just because the restaurant was closing. We talked so much about so many things: then he texted me before he sleeps, saying he can‚Äôt believe he knows someone so quickly like this, and feels so comfortable with me so quickly, and that we should ‚Äòlet time play its role.‚Äô Note that even before we met we joked about how we‚Äôre gonna start dating if we meet. 

The day after that, we met in the church community event. Then I accompanied him to the doctor. Before I went home, I kissed him. This is a 3 day mark since knowing him now. 

The next day, we‚Äôre ‚Äúboyfriends and girlfriends.‚Äù

13 days after - we broke up, because something was wrong. We don‚Äôt know what, but we just feel like we had to.

We still talked and became really close even after the breakup, we still acted like we dated, and no one knew we broke up, months after we broke up. However, there was so much tiring running and chasing. I felt that when he chased, I couldn‚Äôt be there, I felt like I needed to run. When I chased, he blocked me.

Now I‚Äôm most probably in surrender, or in the chase still. I don‚Äôt know, but it isn‚Äôt as strong as the chase before.

I don‚Äôt know where I got the strength to do a 27 x 3 novena. Its really beyond my reach - maybe him being placed in my life was as a hurdle to teach me to pray better.
