interestingasfuck,fecu921,t3_eo0nqq,1578984842.0,"Yeah it’s long- but funny.  My story of being mortified by my dad doing this while I was in HS.  I got pay back when he died. 



My father was balding.  He had a hair transplant in the early 80’s.  I’m not sure it even worked, but he had the thin combover many older men have. It would fly up on the wind.  Basically, very obvious he was balding.


When I was in high school we lived in a small town where he had a prominent job. Most people knew him.  

One afternoon he tells me he is going “into town” AKA” the large metropolitan area by us.  Ok, this was totally normal errand for him on his day off. 

That night I am standing in the kitchen and he comes thru the back door with a full thick (like Ron burgundy) hair.  He goes from 2/10 of his hair to a full 10/10 hair.  I can’t help but to laugh and peed myself. I said, ok funny joke, now take it off.  That motherfucker says I can’t and starts showing me how it is glued to his head.  

At this point I start crying because I am mortified.  I try to talk him out of walking into his office the next day.  The whole night he got upset because no matter where I was in the house he could here me cackling just thinking about it.  I would laugh so hard I couldn’t breathe and he wasn’t even in my eyesight. 

The next day he walks into his office to see patients.  His secretary was on the phone when he walked through the door.  I’m guessing it was a patient. As soon as she saw him she yelled, “I gotta go there is an emergency” and hung up on this poor patient.  

Apparently he told no one,  consulted  no one, nor thought to seek advice of well, any body.  She was floored and laughed for a few minutes.  He was so proud of that damn toupee.   

After, a few years, I got used to it.  He would go every few months to get it glued down.  The front would start peeling off and it was so obvious. 

About 8 years after he got this thing, he got cancer and was in a hospital bed in my living room.  All his regular hair fell out so at this point he just had the toupee glued to the top of his head.  He looked like one of the three stooges.  

He kept picking at the glue and slowly peeling it off.  I walk out one morning and jump when I see an animal on the floor.  I look up and my dad is completely bald and I realize it’s his fucking toupee.  He said “it got hot so I pulled it off”.  

A few weeks after he did pass peacefully.  I put his toupee in his little carryall bag and threw it in my closet.   I got a dog about a month after he died to cheer me up. 

I come home one day and I guess I didn’t close the hallway closet door very well.  I see my Jack Russell terrier running around with something.  I realize he has dug out the toupee and was now having the time of his life with his new toy.  I laughed so hard as I knew my dad would have been pissed that his beloved toupee was being kicked around the living room like a rag doll.  As much fun as the dog was having, I took the hairpiece away and out of reach.   

I should have framed the damn thing.  This was decades ago and I don’t know where it is or if anyone has it.  I think his secretary might have it.  

But my dad loved his toupee because he feared anyone seeing him bald.  He wouldn’t be caught dead bald.  It did help his confidence with women.  So, that was nice. 

At his funeral, he was buried completely bald.  At the viewing I turned to his secretary and said, “well the jokes on him. He got caught dead completely bald.”  We both agreed it was the perfect send off for him! 




TL:DR 

My dad got a toupee when I was in high school because he feared anyone seeing him bald.  I  was mortified. After he died my dog decided the toupee was his favorite chew toy and I buried my dad completely bald. So, he got caught dead completely bald- his biggest fear!"
