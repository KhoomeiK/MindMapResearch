The static map syntax is beautiful, immutability is the direction we will be going in, but Clojure has fatal flaws in efficiency. 
I'm hoping it awakens a love for Lisp that draws people back to CL so the CL community learns from what the Clojure community has done right. CLs biggest issue imo, is the implementation indecision which hampers the ability to decide on anything, so you end up with tens of libraries that solve the exact same problems and tens of lisp implementations that all mal-conform to the common lisp spec so if you want to write a universal library you have to learn 10 different ways each language does it.

You're human, you know this, just thought it might help to say. He'll still be your friend, but you'll have an ambiguous memory of how you felt towards him and will love him but in a different way. 

I had a crush on my best friend in college. I'm super introverted and he's not so he sort of adopted me and early on I wasn't sure of his motives so I ended up falling for him and I just kept it to myself when I found out for sure he was straight. 

We were best friends so he came to me with girl troubles, and it hurt a lot to try and be there in those moments but I had to cope with the reality that he *couldn't* ever feel for me like I did for him. It's hard to cope with that feeling because it's tightly wound up with loneliness, which became *resentment* because I came to believe he expected me to help him figure this out while he just got to accept that I would be alone.

This wasn't true or fair at all, but that's the place your mind takes you if you indulge. You absolve yourself of responsibility for the pain to distance yourself from it. It took a long time, but I learned to take responsibility for my loneliness instead of turning it into resentment.

We're still friends in spite of that internal struggle on my part and at a certain point he had a new girlfriend. He asked me what I thought about her and I felt genuine joy for him, there was no jealousy, I just felt happy that he was with someone I also respected. The pain of knowing he'd never love me is a distant memory."

Clojure,fibick8,t3_f791fm,1582322574.0,"pre-TL;DR: Functional languages will be much less painful that OOP. The REPL and Emacs development are prime.

Everything speeds up. Less boiler-plate to write since Lein handles creating project files, and templates can build everything else as well. Creating new ""classes"" is similarly quick. Paredit fixes handling of the only syntax you'd normally be plagued with in Java. Can't stress enough that for server development, the REPL environment will be hard to lose once you're used to it. Compiling functions into live-running code is just beautiful. 

Since you're comfy with Java, as was I, you'll probably think of things in terms of Object Oriented programming at first, but it's cool watching those ideas melt away and the problems you used to have vanish because you're not rigidly forced to couple functions with data, and all of the ""design pattern"" problems that creates, you'll find that you have a lot more freedom. Thinking in Clojure feels way more fluid. 

There are some pain points though, I ran into, just the other day, what people always criticize, which is non-static typing... Since you use Maps a lot in Clojure, I'm used to seeing the structure of a Map, but records can also output looking like a map. I was debugging errors in a library I was using, for an hour only to realize the macro I was passing a map into was expecting a Record, but the output looked the same. SO, it's not without pain points, but those pain points are laughable when comparing just about any functional language to the problems of OOP."

lbry,fg8m8zl,t1_fg8haj2,1580624133.0,"It makes sense if you pronounce LBRY Everytime you see it. But to me LBRY is kind of a logo or an icon, so seeing 'ans' afterward looks wrong.

'ians' is intuitive to the way you read. You glance quickly and understand the LBRY icon/logo/name and you understand 'ians' so together it makes sense. Lbryans, isn't familiar so you have to break it down so it doesn't look wrong and end up wanting to read it as 'libryans'. The 'i' should stay."

No fucking way am I trusting a startup to not sell my data when they don't make that second round of funding or etc."

I upvoted this, but I think it's not an issue of sexual attraction, it's just the socialites. Gays grew up not being accepted, so they're maybe a little more inclined to crave acceptance and status."
