deadbydaylight,fr497jr,t3_gml0j4,1589880341.0,If you like playing Spirit keep playing her who cares have fun
deadbydaylight,fr4925a,t3_gml24p,1589880186.0,Always respect the killer
deadbydaylight,fr481uo,t3_gmj82e,1589879130.0,I really hate this perk it feels unfair to the killer sometimes. They definitely need to rework it.
deadbydaylight,fr47839,t3_gmjpnm,1589878271.0,I always say give it a try and honestly if you really aren't having fun just quit a few minutes in.
deadbydaylight,fr46y99,t3_gmjwbw,1589877986.0,At some point he probably will get a rework leatherface deserves better he's iconic.
deadbydaylight,fr467fs,t3_gmkfwp,1589877221.0,Nothing wrong with playing the mobile version!
deadbydaylight,fr41clh,t1_fr4182r,1589872505.0,Wow that's ridiculous
deadbydaylight,fr3x5i9,t3_gmiyoa,1589868803.0,I'm using that combo right now in red ranks and honestly doesn't seem to good it just slows the game down a tiny bit. Still able to get 4ks with 1 or 2 gens remaining. I suggest another combo good survivors still get gens done especially if they gen rush.
deadbydaylight,fr3srl3,t3_gmgziu,1589865260.0,Spirit she's better and Ghostface is kinda hard to use at first.
deadbydaylight,fr3sowm,t1_fr3s3mx,1589865203.0,It's good majority of the time but sometimes people are just completely useless.
deadbydaylight,fr3sjse,t3_gmhn21,1589865094.0,Get good at mind games with survivors she's best at that.
deadbydaylight,fr3kzt7,t3_gmcad5,1589859713.0,Turn the corner and a Jake is removing the hook

deadbydaylight,fqwkvu2,t1_fqwjsku,1589708200.0,Yeah sometimes I do!
deadbydaylight,fqwhpo3,t3_glbqhn,1589704823.0,Don't listen to the survivors just play how you want and have fun with the game. No matter what you do or say players in this game are toxic to anything especially to killer.
deadbydaylight,fqwhn86,t3_glbqz4,1589704753.0,It was like that for me but after being in purple for a while and learning by playing more and more. I completely destroy in red ranks now. The only time I struggle is with of course swf but that's gonna happen sometimes.
predator,fqwenzo,t3_gl5sxw,1589701728.0,A lot of nostalgia right here
deadbydaylight,fqt1ry5,t1_fqt0ciw,1589627002.0,Ranks are definitely pointless and I'd definitely say all they pretty much tell you is how much knowledge the player might have. Besides that it absolutely does not mean skill especially for survivors. Killers are different.
toastme,fqsy8cf,t3_gkn5zg,1589623286.0,I really hate math and have always struggled with it congratulations!

Terminator,fqsha32,t3_gkmila,1589607245.0,Really wanna watch T2 in theaters never got the chance. It's my favorite movie and it was before my time. I had no idea the film got re-released in theaters with a 3D gimmick recently. It's one of the biggest parts of my childhood and seeing it in the theater once would be amazing. v-v
predator,fqrle4g,t3_gkgz12,1589586711.0,The predator is pure garbage I hate it a lot really stupid movie.
deadbydaylight,fqn9f7d,t1_fqn94cq,1589490910.0,Nice comment thank you!
deadbydaylight,fqn1vkc,t1_fqn0eed,1589487269.0,You sound very ignorant best killer players and survivors on twitch even say moris and keys should be removed. Either your a survivor main or have no idea about the game.
deadbydaylight,fqn08y6,t1_fqmx44v,1589486485.0,Keys are just as good exactly like moris.

deadbydaylight,fqin148,t1_fqijvkg,1589398176.0,Survivor is very easy to play

deadbydaylight,fqgvqtl,t3_giu2ho,1589358799.0,I can see this happening if you play killer but as survivor I never DC.
deadbydaylight,fqgvbf3,t3_giuigg,1589358372.0,I think bubba is a good killer and besides spirit he was my 2nd level 40 killer. I always get 3ks or 4ks with him. Now swf either destroy me or give me at least 1 hook. I also love his bbq and chilli for the bloodpoints. He's a fun killer to play on console!
deadbydaylight,fqgftaz,t3_gimkcd,1589345170.0,When I saw this doctor was the exact thing I thought of. Next game all I did was shock bill in one loop. Lol
deadbydaylight,fqcunvq,t3_gi68qf,1589269528.0,Here on the west side it's always late morning and afternoon. At night the queues are very long.
deadbydaylight,fqcum77,t3_gi6a6p,1589269485.0,It depends if they get the license for aliens or the original alien which are both different. I would prefer if they got the original Ripley and Alien from the first film.
Terminator,fqcs909,t3_gheetc,1589267239.0,I've always loved T3 not perfect but still a fun time.
deadbydaylight,fqcruzz,t1_fqc9m9y,1589266882.0,I have nightmares about decisive strike. This and adrenaline are the only perks that I really hate. Sometimes dead hard but not really.
deadbydaylight,fqcrgwx,t3_gi2y1q,1589266526.0,Just take a break for a bit and come back when they hopefully release the matchmaking fix. It's just a game don't let it ruin your day!
deadbydaylight,fqcqqxu,t3_gi4n3s,1589265872.0,Update the ugly graphics.
deadbydaylight,fqcqo7o,t3_gi4uzo,1589265804.0,I still love jeepers creepers and the original 2 films. But the director is one stick bastard and he deserves no support.
F13thegame,fqcn2e6,t1_fqcmm7b,1589262698.0,Yeah killer players deal with so much toxicity.
F13thegame,fqcm7nv,t3_gi17xb,1589262004.0,Remember seeing this the first time how excited I got always wanted a game like this.
deadbydaylight,fqcfibm,t1_fqcerqf,1589256934.0,I found it and changed it to friends only thank you! :)
deadbydaylight,fqcddte,t1_fqccjre,1589255498.0,I have no idea how to block messages who aren't from friends on Xbox could you help me? And yes most definitely the toxicity when playing killer really makes me not wanna play. :(
deadbydaylight,fqcajgs,t1_fqcag2r,1589253633.0,What system do you play on? I've been thinking of blocking messages also to much toxicity.
deadbydaylight,fqcad8h,t3_gi169i,1589253524.0,Survivor queues are really long on Xbox especially late at night. It's because a lot of people are playing survivor and not enough killer players to go around.
deadbydaylight,fqca9xv,t3_gi1885,1589253468.0,It looks really good to me! :O
deadbydaylight,fqc9srh,t3_gi1qn8,1589253165.0,They need to fix the matchmaking immediately.
F13thegame,fqbgtlj,t1_fqbg8x0,1589236712.0,Dead by daylight community is good but mostly toxic.
F13thegame,fqbf5pn,t1_fqbf0q9,1589235841.0,Sadly I do to now since it still has updates but sometimes I go back and play friday. :)
deadbydaylight,fq9t41z,t1_fq9m7hj,1589206500.0,Genrushing is a legit thing and yes it's the objective but when the killer spawns. Survivors that are able to finish a gen before the killer can even get to it is unfair. That's why it was nerfed recently completely broken.
deadbydaylight,fq9sp1f,t3_gho7yh,1589206251.0,I don't think it's crossplay yet.
deadbydaylight,fq9snd6,t1_fq9shyw,1589206223.0,This video really helped me! https://youtu.be/9Jrv7TQYg5U
deadbydaylight,fq9rxg9,t1_fq9ro6q,1589205790.0,His whole animation should definitely do damage. When you charge up your chainsaw survivors should stay as far away as possible from you no matter what if they get close it's a down. That's what I think he should be known for.
deadbydaylight,fq9rjik,t3_ghn3li,1589205555.0,When you're looping make sure to stay very close to the wall while running because it gives you extra time to loop and killers can't do it the same way survivors do. I suggest looking up a video on youtube about it.
deadbydaylight,fq9qw73,t3_ghnvh7,1589205159.0,I really like both but honestly bubba to me does seem weaker overall. He needs some kind of buff like maybe less overall slow when missing hits.
xbox,fq95si8,t3_ghdkzt,1589186581.0,A brute would enjoy this snack. :)
Terminator,fq926w7,t3_ghfg6v,1589182942.0,Terminator 1 and 2 are perfect you can honestly go either way. It's just personal preference at that point.
deadbydaylight,fq8x51d,t3_ghhdqt,1589178154.0,The killer then looks at the generators there is only two left to complete. Killer either quits or camps last hook after exit is open.
deadbydaylight,fq8wzk7,t3_ghhlqb,1589178019.0,No matter what you do as Killer survivors complain. People become so salty when they lose or toxic if they win. I quickly start the next match doesn't matter if I lost or won the one before no need to be toxic to anyone.
deadbydaylight,fq8wtnx,t3_ghhy5n,1589177874.0,3 kills against a swf with trapper congrats!!! :D I bet it was very frustrating though good job.
deadbydaylight,fq5cbr2,t3_ggw65b,1589099973.0,Hopefully the devs fix this during the anniversary.
deadbydaylight,fq5c3zx,t3_ggwwtj,1589099749.0,When in the lobby before the match if you have a feeling they might be a swf just quit before it starts. You usually can tell by outfits or names.
deadbydaylight,fq5bw3y,t1_fq59zmf,1589099518.0,When people think rank matters in this game it's hilarious.
deadbydaylight,fq58pfs,t3_ggvjqh,1589096268.0,It's really easy to dodge demo ain't a problem.
deadbydaylight,fq58d1f,t3_ggvynk,1589095926.0,Because people don't wanna waste time honestly.
deadbydaylight,fq5879t,t3_ggw5fh,1589095772.0,I would love the thing and they could do some really crazy cool gameplay! :D
deadbydaylight,fq5852h,t3_ggw8ap,1589095712.0,Plague has awesome perks.
deadbydaylight,fq581j8,t1_fq559z2,1589095615.0,They need to add this if survivors wanna play with friends and have fun. People who play killers want to have fun also and going against swf isn't fun.
Battlefield,fq54o22,t3_ggjan5,1589092405.0,Still alive and well on Xbox but not like the glory days!
Battlefield,fq54iyb,t3_ggizfa,1589092277.0,I honestly say go for both been enjoying them a lot. It honestly depends which setting do you prefer. Bf1 is definitely the better game but both have pros and cons.
Battlefield,fq547i6,t3_ggqbue,1589091985.0,Yeah lots of people still play.
Battlefield,fq546d4,t3_ggsdfy,1589091957.0,Played it 2 years ago and honestly I had fun definitely worth a try at least once.
deadbydaylight,fq509xe,t3_ggunkn,1589088673.0,That would be cool her or the grudge! :O
deadbydaylight,fq508ml,t3_ggurvw,1589088645.0,I think Myers can be really fun to play and not to hard.
Steelbooks,fq4yr8d,t3_ggki34,1589087517.0,Wow this is amazing! :D
deadbydaylight,fq4y7im,t3_gggnlp,1589087128.0,dead by daylight and overwatch
deadbydaylight,fq3sea0,t3_ggqb7o,1589069648.0,Survivors are so entitled in this game they expect killers to follow the rules they make up. All the toxicity killer mains have to deal with is one big reason why there are so few killer players. I'm not saying every survivor main is toxic but the majority are most definitely.
deadbydaylight,fq3rlo7,t3_ggqiv3,1589069383.0,Noed isn't that bad honestly. I never go against killers with Moris even if they are red or not. Get better at playing survivor and hope your team mates are good.
OWConsole,fq3orq7,t1_fq1qtme,1589068530.0,50 or 100 would be nice this needs to be forced on console.
OWConsole,fq3oo00,t3_gghl2r,1589068501.0,Competitive is so not fun to play especially on console. I pretty much don't take this game seriously but try my best to play casual. I only play with friends and the game can be fun most of the time. The ranked experience for overwatch is horrible.
OWConsole,fq3mg5g,t3_gghl2r,1589067907.0,Ranked is such a horrible experience and very frustrating. Everyone is better off not playing it.
OWConsole,fq3mb39,t1_fq1urw6,1589067870.0,On Xbox most looking for group players are bad and really toxic. The very good players you do find are beyond toxic. I just play this game with my friends only way to have fun with it.
Battlefield,fpzp09z,t3_gg90r7,1589021448.0,Yeah people still play it's on sale right now so definitely worth a pick up.
StarWarsBattlefront,fpzm5i0,t3_gg78do,1589020154.0,🥺
deadbydaylight,fpz35vi,t3_ggbibx,1589012936.0,That's honestly how the game is right now. lol
F13thegame,fpyuav7,t3_gg82ca,1589009247.0,Majority of people in games do teabagging just to troll or get the other player mad. The best thing you can do is not get heated and don't give them the attention they seek.
Battlefield,fpysry0,t1_fpvehqa,1589008699.0,Battlefield 4 is still active on Xbox yes I play sometimes.
Battlefield,fpysllz,t3_gfohf3,1589008637.0,Yes for Xbox it's still worth a buy go for it! :)
deadbydaylight,fpyqesf,t1_fpyq2qa,1589007886.0,Yeah I enjoy playing Killer when it feels like I can win.
deadbydaylight,fpypxxr,t1_fpyozwq,1589007713.0,My issue is I'm not good enough to go against these sweaty red rank players. Some aren't good but the majority are especially with all the annoying perks. The game keeps having me go against them which isn't fun.
deadbydaylight,fpynhcl,t3_gga7bn,1589006733.0,Nope that's why I became a survivor main killer is either boring or frustrating to play.
residentevil,fpyhmtw,t3_gg4stz,1589004038.0,Love this!
xbox,fput0lq,t3_gfliqz,1588922701.0,This game is my childhood I still have it and hopefully some day we get a remaster don't give up hope! :)
deadbydaylight,fpr36be,t3_gf0buv,1588840734.0,Super cute! :D
