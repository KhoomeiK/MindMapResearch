chicago,fqfmmf9,t1_fqfke83,1589327643.0,"So I actually don't think it's a conspiracy. But I  do think it's political and Pritzker has sort of backed himself into a corner. He's relying on a bailout from a future democratic president which will heal a lot of the state's long-term pains without having to make the tough budget decisions. It might be a good bet. And in the meantime he's making a name for himself standing up to Trump. 

Pritzker isn't evil, but his incentives are not necessarily aligned with the overall welfare of the citizens of the state. For the record I voted for him.

I don't recall if I said max restrictions or towards max restrictions. I'm mobile so I'm not checking. But if I said the former, I should have clarified to the latter. Obviously not max restrictions, but Illinois is closer to more restrictive than other states. I think thats a shared premise between us, yes?

I wouldn't call myself a libertarian. Some common sense restrictions are good. I just think Illinois has taken it too far. I'm disturbed by how easily we've abandoned prior narratives as to why we were doing this lockdown - ""moving the goalposts"". I'm also concerned by how whether you're on the red team or the blue team seems to dictate your response.

The nuance is lost. Evidence doesn't matter. We're doing it this way because we are. Because our society has swung far into the paternalism. I am against that."

I believe the explanation is that the basic, common sense measures they're taking in places like Georgia achieve a majority of the positive outcomes we can hope to achieve. I believe each additional restriction has a diminishing marginal return beyond that.

We should really start thinking in terms of marginal costs and benefits. If basic social distancing measures achieve similar results to what we see in Georgia while not putting everyone else under a really burdensome lockdown we should consider that heavily.

There are common sense measures which can have significant impact on public health. But Illinois has chosen to approach the situation with a sledgehammer when perhaps a scalpel was more appropriate.

Is that because we spent resources on people who aren't really at risk and have destroyed enough wealth to make it much more difficult now? I think those two things are a factor, honestly. There was a way for us to protect the vulnerable, limit deaths, and not destroy the world economy in the process. But our politicians and the experts they listened to didn't think of repercussions, or they took the path with the least amount of nuance. It was an error on their part. 

I don't think people like Pritzker are evil. I just think they got the strategy wrong. I think Fauci is an admirable man with a great deal of expertise in his field. But I think his focus was too narrow. That's all. I can disagree with the strategy while agreeing with the objective."

I think people are downplaying the economic consequences honestly. This is going to get really bad.

Economic security drives the entire social fabric. We don't know the harm we've already caused. Whatever death toll the coronavirus results in, it won't look like shit compared to the fallout over the next 25 years."
Coronavirus,fo4zm4d,t1_fo4sfpc,1587514382.0,"New York and Italian hospitals are actually kind of trash. It's actually kind of embarrassing how bad some New York hospitals are.

And Italy sort of infamously runs close to full capacity in normal times.

I wish people would stop pointing to two pretty poor hospital systems and extrapolating out to more robust healthcare systems."
Coronavirus,fo4ykzn,t1_fo4ebs2,1587513779.0,I've honestly lost all hope for a vaccine. There's never been one for a coronavirus. It is not coming. There is no vaccine coming. This is our future now.
Coronavirus,fo4yfbi,t1_fo4rbms,1587513685.0,Yup. People who will never be the same. Their children who will never have the same opportunity. For generations. We should have gone with the swedish model. We've doomed ourselves.
LockdownSkepticism,fnz1814,t1_fnyzu6i,1587383032.0,"It's exactly this. The death count is baked in +/- a few percent. That's the entire concept of the curve. 

The only way a softer strategy like the one in Sweden results in more deaths is if the healthcare system gets collapsed on top of itself as it did in Italy. 

But Italy is a horrendous comparison to other first world countries. Italy routinely runs out of hospital beds during flu season. It's an old country with a high population of smokers. Italy and New York City are the outliers."
