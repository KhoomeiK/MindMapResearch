EDAnonymous,fm0og0v,t1_fm0g37w,1585662865.0,"I disagree with this. 

Our media really perpetuates so much. 

If you look into the history of the shift (and there is a shift in what size is seen as beautiful) it really comes down to product production. In summary, it is easier to make sizes rather than make one piece that fits JUST that model, especially when it comes to advertising and the images used to help sell the product. By creating sizing they were able to just allow for few alterations before the model showed off the garment. They began setting a standard for those sizes so they would only need to make one pattern and the consumer could just see what fit and what didn't.

Then we jump into how to make sure people get the correct size for them. Designers could have really picked any shape, but slim girls all have a tendency to be built relatively similar, as opposed to girls who may have more weight (because we don't all hold our weight in the same area.) This ""regulation of thinness"" allowed them to have options when picking models.

I'm not saying that I agree with all this, but the history really is interesting and if looked at from the business aspect has logical points (again not saying I agree with them, but it makes sense).

Don't blame boys, blame fashion and our desire for convenience.
