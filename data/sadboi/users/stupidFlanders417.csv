[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA4nlh7Lm4Q) explains how to find your wind correction angle and GS.

And [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwnTFxocb4A) explains how to calculate your fuel burn. Note that you will need to know your GS, and the distance between legs. If your going 200 miles at a GS of 150kts it will take you 80 min. You can find your fuel burn in Gallons per Hour in the POH. If you burn 8.5 GPH, then in 80 min you'll burn a bit under 11.5 gallons

For your headings you'll start with finding your true course (the line from point to point on your sectional). Once you have your true course you find your wind correction angle. Let's say your true course is directly west (270), and the winds are coming from the south. That's going to push you north as you fly so you will need to point your nose slightly south to counter that wind. Let's say you come up with a WCA of 8 degrees. This will give you a True Heading of 262. Now the lines of longitude on the map don't point to the magnetic north pole, so you next need to correct for that. This part is easy. You look at your sectional and find the nearest isogonic line. If you look at KRQE on skyvector you can see it's right near is the 10 East line. If you have a west correction add it to your True Heading, if it's east subtract it (West is best, east is least). This would give you a Magnetic Heading of 252. Then finally you correct for any deviations in the compass itself using the compass card for your actual magnetic compass to get your Compass Heading.

Edit - If you don't have an E6B already you can download apps to your phone for that. I like Flight Computer Sim on android, but I haven't really tried any others. And just a CMA, I'm a student myself, not an instructor. But I've planned two XCs in the last week that my CFI was happy with so I am pretty comfortable with the E6B"

So I cancelled the whole account, called them right back up to create a new account and got 200/200 for $45 a month.
