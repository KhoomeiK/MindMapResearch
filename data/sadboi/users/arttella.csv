SafeSexPH,fhyfymj,t3_e5wymy,1581975124.0,Hi! I don't really know where to ask this but is it advisable to get an IUD even if i'm still a virgin? I really want to get one but i'm kinda scared of the process itself. I'm sorry if the question seems dumb.

NevilleGoddard,eu9yqm7,t1_eu9yl5a,1563594942.0,I see. I guess i have to work on my thoughts throughout the day. Thank you for this!

NevilleGoddard,esmm5cx,t1_eskju68,1562108799.0,"I have trouble ""feeling"" that my desires have been fulfilled and i don't know why, not only in this lotto desire but also in other things i tried to manifest. Granted, i'm a beginner but i would like some guidance so it doesn't seem like my efforts are going to waste. I can imagine in my head that my desire having been fulfilled. My issue is i can't seem to be in the state of feeling it to be real afterwards so i end up ""obsessing"" over my desire and wanting it to happen, despite the need to think that it has already happened. I might be visualizing stuff in my head in a wrong way. What do you suggest?"
NevilleGoddard,esh09rx,t1_esh01xw,1561976481.0,That makes so much sense to me now! Thank you for this. I'll keep this in mind.
NevilleGoddard,esgztvf,t1_esgy1kx,1561975816.0,Thank you!! I have trouble imagining the feeling since it's like everything around me is denying it and for some reason sometimes i can't control my thoughts and idk why but that might be because i just started this journey. I haven't tried scripting so i dont know if it'll work for me. Thank you again for the tips and the warm welcome!!

Basically they just give me prescription meds and all our sessions are so empty. I dont feel comfortable telling her anything. I do want to change therapist but we're short on money and i dont know how to open up to other people again.

I'm sorry you're going through the same thing i am. I hope we make it out of this."
