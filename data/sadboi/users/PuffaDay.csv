elliottsmith,fgv4rq4,t1_fgr32an,1581137115.0,"that's literally the popular opinion. I think he more than likely killed himself. 

Here's case studies of people stabbing themselves 30+ times. I wont link because it's horrifyingly NSFL. It's common to feel shock or adrenaline and attempt again. I volunteered in a psychiatric unit and it was rare like once every few months but there self inflicted were stabs to the chest area ( non fatal ofc, they usually are)

1. 'At autopsy 39 stab and incised wounds were found: the left forearm showed 13 incised wounds, one of which deep enough to sever the radial artery, while 14 ones were found on the right forearm. Neck observation revealed three deep cut injuries but none reached the internal jugular vein or the carotid artery. On the chest there were nine stab wounds, one of which injured the heart apex leading to a 80ml haemopericardium.'

2. If you look up suicide by self stabbing there is a scientific article investigating 28 such deaths

3. Abstract of a second study with 8 people 'In five of the eight cases, unusual findings such as a single stab wound, multiple cut injuries, no , mark or presence of clothing injuries were found.'

I can go on and on and on. Disturbing as it is, it happens. Self stabbing happens. Elliott Smith was suicidal. Can I prove he was not murdered? No. Are you speculating something but acting like your suspicions are fact. Yes. Chibas life is ruined whether she killed him or not. I believe she didn't kill him and if there was substantial proof she did (which there would almost definitely be) she'd be at the very least charged by LA authorities. Instead a bunch of Elliott Smith fans circlejerk furiously around a conspiracy theory not willing to accept a person at extremely high risk of suicide could've killed himself. A person who, according to friends, avoided most psychological treatment (other than occasional addiction rehabs/counseling), with a long history of abuse and trauma, couldn't possibly have killed himself! It's as open and shut as it'll ever be. I just feel terrible for Chiba if she didn't murder him, which I highly doubt she did, because she was probably traumatized by that and people keep bringing it up, blaming her. Yeah, that's not problematic..."
