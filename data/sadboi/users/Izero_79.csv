bipolar2,fqy6j61,t3_glgafu,1589743430.0,"Lol at captain hypo. The 48-72 hour rule is always a good one before you spend money or commit to that new thing that is going change everything - force yourself to wait 2-3 days before making decisions. Use that time to focus your hypomania on researching said thing rather than buying or committing straight up. It’s not failsafe, but it can help.

Another technique I use, is also make sure I research multiple perspectives on things. If I’m looking at buying something I seek out negative reviews and weigh them up (considerations include is the person just being a fussy dick, is it something that would piss me off, are the negatives consistent across numerous sites). If I’m going down some new rabbit hole (say new health fad or conspiracy theory)... I will always google search the counter position. Sometimes you just have to discuss it with someone - but at least research yourself first.

Hopefully that helps. I have had to learn this, because unless people (such as my wife) go on the journey with me and gently help me figure out my idea is stupid it can trigger my irritability big time.. which is totally my issue not anyone else’s."

I’d recommend getting into see some kind pysch/therapist about the anger as a priority. 

As an intermediary step, perhaps when you feel the anger rising, pull yourself out of the situation - do some exercise or find a nice quiet space and read or do something to distract yourself (resist the temptation to go back fight - that’s the hardest bit with this strategy). If you do this, discuss this strategy with your fiancé, so he knows to give you a bit of space. When I’m having an anxiety attack, I have a mantra I repeat “youre just being irrational”.. when I’m having paranoid/intrusive thoughts ie let’s say I start irrationally thinking someone hates me, I start listing all the evidence to suggest that they don’t actually hate me.

Last 6 months has been interesting as we had bushfires which triggered a long hypo, but I was only on the fringes of the related action at work - so started taking lots of annual leave to give myself “bushfire related jobs” at home such as turning my home into a fortress and buying random survival shit - it was insane genius level stuff lol. That has since backed into covid and I have been right in the thick of the action - which has suited my hypomania perfectly..and every-time I feel a low coming on it just kicks my arse out of it - so my lows have been mixed. 

Worth noting this may not be for everyone. My lows are infrequent - but fucking deep when they kick - I do get lots of mixed state though.. which can make me a grumpy boss to work for at times..

bipolar2,fnexxvi,t3_g12jwh,1586897895.0,"I used to see shadow people / suffer a lot of sleep paralysis in my late teens early twenties. Seems to have died off now (I’m in my early 40s). Still might occasionally get it if I have a day nap...
I’ll get the feeling that something is trying to keep me asleep. Always very weird."
worldnews,fn9o2vb,t1_fn9mhln,1586779894.0,"Hey, I know of restaurant at the end of the universe?"
bipolar2,fn8qunv,t3_g08p5s,1586747895.0,Haha yep. I always know if I’m in one of those if I’m in the kitchen and other people being in the vicinity of the kitchen drives me apeshit. I went through I highly irritated period in Jan/feb where i wanted to pick physical fights with climate change deniers- although I’m pretty sure I cant fight (and I’ve never actually been the violent type either) but I felt hyper-irritated and indestructible. Glad I failed.
bipolar2,fn61enc,t3_fxmzyr,1586683651.0,"Rad. I always used to do crazy shit to my hair when hypo.. now I just keep it shaved. It’s grown out a little since isolation and I’ve gone what is apparently a dignified salt and pepper. It makes me feel way too mature.. but shaving just won’t  cut it for radical! I attempted facial hair but it drove me crazy. Lucky I can’t get a tattoo right now, i’d probably get a face tattoo (I’ve always wanted one but it’s not compatible with being a professional type)."

bipolar2,fn5wti2,t3_fz3swc,1586678701.0,"Yes.. I remember reading there is a correlation between migraines, bipolar.. and there is a also correlation between migraines and epilepsy. I’m currently on mild medication for seizures, which have basically stopped my migraines as well as  my seizures... has tempered the frequency and intensity of my bipolar symptoms a teeny bit (is not designated for offlabel bipolar but has been used in studies). I’m not medicated for bipolar (yet).  Topamax is the medication... I’m on a super low dosage.. which has meant I don’t get the nasty side effects associated with it."
bipolar2,fn5w5ep,t3_fzjzjz,1586678006.0,My happens around 14:00 and then I pickup a bit later. Suspect it’s related to circadian rhythms for me personally.
canberra,fn4v0ox,t3_fzkr7l,1586649578.0,Have you seen the state the world is in. We’ve fucked our planet in the arse because of human stupidity.. you think a little virus is gonna stop the stupids!! Nah.. no chance!
bipolar2,fmzg8b4,t3_fy2d0i,1586519345.0,"The same as everyday, drenched in unpredictability clinging onto to sanity.. all the while looking at the world around me and weirdly feeling saner than the rest."
australia,fmz96y3,t1_fmyzo5z,1586511377.0,What if the jigsaw you wish to buy is at the trampoline venue. (Trampoline jigsaw puzzles are a hot commodity atm). Would it be permissible to have a bounce while procuring jigsaw? If so would there be a limit and would it be based on number of bounces before you can catch Covid-19? Thanks.

collapse,fms6yiv,t1_fms3uo4,1586348429.0,An idiocrazy maybe?
atheism,fmhlgj8,t1_fmhkbjv,1586085079.0,Just commenting to say how much I love that teen irreverence and attitude - can imagine myself saying something similar at a similar age. Though I’m 40 and still have a little of it in me!
worldnews,fmhexf6,t1_fmhepfl,1586077318.0,Yes I’ve been searching for reputable sources for this and can’t find anything.
bipolar2,fm6hx6f,t1_fm6563r,1585794450.0,"Cool! I checked out your vid! My advice is don’t over think it, just jump to it and make improvements as you go! i.e. don’t be a perfectionist... easier said than done right?! but the more you do it the better you’ll get and the more confident you will feel. Regardless of how much preparation you do, you probably won’t love your first efforts anyway... so just get em out of the way! And You won’t be able to please everyone so just do the best you can do, and I’m sure it will be great - you are doing an amazing thing, and your enthusiasm is infectious."
bipolar2,fm64dha,t3_fspqbo,1585786022.0,"Hey I threw you a like on insta. we are also Apple Watch buds - though you are normally way more active than me, but maybe not today - thanks to the return of my normal hypomania - my moods have been strange as my work is Covid related and I have been homeschooling my daughter as well working a fuck tonne of hours- today is my first normal hypo in ages! (Yesterday I thought I was headed for a deep-ass depression and bam!!)

Anyway I’m super busy so not sure I’ll be able to join in the zoom sessions but if you end posting them afterwards I’d be interested in checking them out and having a crack!"
