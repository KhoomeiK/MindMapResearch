You seem to be going around in circles on some parts of your story and I can only imagine how much anxiety you’re in. I want you to find freedom from these thoughts someday. You may not believe it now but you will. I’m so sorry these people failed you so horribly. I want to see that bad ass bitch deep in your soul rise up and lift you from the ashes! Time heals all and you will learn that you have room to improve in emotional strength. This is how some men are and from now on you will be cautious of their intentions. 
Do you like writing? Maybe you could channel these negative thoughts into a story. It sounds like you want to tell it, you know? Maybe change some things to make it less obvious it’s so personal, but I think many people would love to hear your thoughts and what you have been through, especially when you eventually realize your self worth and power.
when I had my own experience i was obsessed with trying to rationalize what happened. I was going insane. I tried to see it from all different angles but kept coming back to me feeling broken, useless, unclean. hated myself, it got worse the more I kept it in and spun it around in my head. It HAUNTED me. Years of carrying this guilt over something I had little control over. I was young and naive and did what I was told. I don’t know why I did what I did. Probably for attention. I wish I could go back in time but hey, whatever. This is my life. I’m so strong now, too! ;) I met like-minded people. I have seen so many grow from their mistakes. 
What happened to me, it could have honestly happened to anyone. Someday you might understand this, too. We can decide what’s next in life and that’s all that really matters. You will find a way to move through this, meet amazing people, and live happily."

You WERE looking for comfort and putting his needs before your own because if he was happy with you, maybe your other problems wouldn’t seem so bad. maybe you’d feel better if you went along with him. It’s ok to want some acceptance, especially after you were hurt already, especially from people you think are friendly. you THOUGHT you could put your trust in a friend and learned a painful lesson. You don’t need them, there’s so many better people out there you can make friends with that won’t lie or hurt you. Don’t let this experience tarnish you for the rest of your life. You were not in the right headspace to make any decisions and he knew that and used it against you. you were an emotional mess and he wore you down until you submitted. He had you trapped like a caged animal and you needed platonic physical comfort. 

It’s ok to lie to him, you owe him NOTHING. you do what you need to do to stay safe and escape that ridicule if they are still close by. Understand? the worst thing you can do for yourself is carry this guilt. It’s not worth it, let it go, make friends with yourself."

relationship_advice,fokgjjr,t3_g7rw4k,1587841657.0,"Do you honestly believe you are actually ugly tho? Or is it just wearing on your self esteem? I’m going to assume you’re pretty because you’re brave enough to have a YouTube channel. People are nasty when objectifying women and social media comments are toxic af. 

That’s not the real you when you put yourself out there on social media/YouTube, that’s a version of you that people enjoy judging and comparing to themselves. I’m sorry to say, it doesn’t go away, but you can combat it by not giving a shit. They objectify you, you can objectify them right back! Comments are important to get insight from your audience, so let Sarah sort through them and give yourself a rest. 
You can’t change public opinion once it’s out there - but if you can’t beat them, join them! Maybe you could play up being ‘the ugly one’. Maybe having a give-no-shits attitude will make you ‘the cool one’. Eventually it gets easier to grow your brand once you learn how to separate your feelings from your business. Think of your face as part of that brand (along with Sarah’s) and how you can get creative and make this work for you rather than against you. It takes a very strong person to make it on YouTube. You can do this! 

Right now, maybe it is better if you focus on videos that don’t put your face front and center on screen. Let your self esteem heal up for a while. it’s great Sarah is willing to be proactive rather than tell you to put up with it! She sounds like a great partner. If you put your heads together, anything is possible. Don’t give up, focus on what you like doing together and keep at it."
