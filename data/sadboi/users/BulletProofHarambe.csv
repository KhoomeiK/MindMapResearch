hiphopheads,fj4qy5b,t1_fj4nuvd,1583014773.0,"Lil Keed is signed to Thugâ€™s YSL label if you forgot, and you can say the same thing about Lil Baby and Gunna as well. The problem with Desiigner is heâ€™s a New York artist stealing an Atlanta flow. Future himself doesnâ€™t like Desiigner and that by itself is enough to see why he hasnâ€™t continued being successful. Nicki Minaj and Drake are successful due to their music actually being marketable and original at times. Kanye may have not done enough to help him develop his own sound but Desiigner definitely hasnâ€™t helped himself much with that either. He would get big name features if he was a big name artist, but his sound just isnâ€™t very good or marketable. Itâ€™s not just the label getting features the artist actually has to have people willing to work with them, and Desiigner just doesnâ€™t have that. His lack of features on other rappers albums shows this as well. If you have a song that sounds like Futureâ€™s wave youâ€™re gonna want Future to lay down a verse and not a copycat."
hiphopheads,fj4mu0y,t1_fj4mmx9,1583011950.0,Yeah but that proves my point Travis was signed under Very GOOD Beats as a producer so even with Kanyeâ€™s help it was his own sound that pushed him to stardom.

hiphopheads,fj4lksr,t1_fj4ks6h,1583011103.0,"If Desiigner made original music I would listen to him. The reason they promoted Travis was because he actually had the quality to blow up past a one hit wonder and thatâ€™s shown through Rodeo arguably being the best trap album released thus far. I listened to LOD the day it dropped and I was far less than impressed, itâ€™s not Kanyeâ€™s problem if his artist isnâ€™t original, and he did a lot more than most label heads would do by making Pt. 2. Sure Kanye probably could have helped him develop his sound more but thatâ€™s something that Travis and Cudi did themselves so why couldnâ€™t Desiigner do it too? Itâ€™s simply due to the fact that his sound is a rip-off of one of the most popular artists in the same lane as him which just isnâ€™t sustainable if you want to have a good career"
hiphopheads,fj4k3t0,t1_fj4jgfe,1583010121.0,I think itâ€™s mostly Yeezus and MBDTF cuts combined with whatever he was going for on So Help Me God. Definitely not Kanyeâ€™s best work but at least we got my two favorite artists on a track produced by my favorite producer in NMPILA
hiphopheads,fj4jd33,t1_fj4j02o,1583009623.0,Mhm so Travis Scott just somehow succeeded even though he was under a trash label? Itâ€™s not Kanyeâ€™s and Pushaâ€™s problem if one of their artists doesnâ€™t make good music. Iâ€™m gonna be real with you I havenâ€™t listened to most of those songs and itâ€™s because I havenâ€™t liked Desiignerâ€™s shit from the start and every time Iâ€™ve tried to listen to him I find it extremely lazy and boring. And Outlet definitely sounds like something Future would rap over.
