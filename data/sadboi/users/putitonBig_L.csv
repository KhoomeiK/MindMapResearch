Rollerskating,fqk0qbu,t1_fqjzja1,1589418173.0,"Yes crescent lunge exactly!!! Once you have made contact with the ground and toe stop, recenter your weight to both legs and while pressing try to drag your foot forward to meet your knee again. 
This video is a prime example on how to do it, time stamp 1:35 for toe stopping while rolling!

Rollerskating,fqjz8w8,t3_gjbe0w,1589417442.0,"One of the best things that helped the longevity of my toe stops is fixing my posture. The longer you have to drag it to stop, the more you will go through it. 
When you are ready to stop, lean forward on the foot you arent using to stop with, towards the ball of your foot, knees bent, as you bring your foot behind to stop. Then, make contact with the ground with your toe stop, trying to press the top of your foot to the ground. The harder you press, the more it sticks to the surface you are stopping on, stopping quicker.
Also, sucking your stomach in, and tilting your pelvis foward at the same time helps with the pressing of your toe stop down. I learned that from yoga, aka 'engaging your core'. Clench your leg muscles and stomach while you are doing this and you will be able to stop on a dime!"

Rollerskating,eutyo70,t3_chaicu,1564033974.0,"All I know is I've had the Sabina Candi Grl skates for a month and they are awful. I had to immediately change the toe stops as they were HARD plastic and legit did not stop me. They felt like what a hydro flask lid is made of! The boot is separating from the heel, after 1 month! I feel the wheels are too hard to be advertised as outdoor wheels. The hardness on top of the wheel quality, makes an 82A feel like bricks. If moxi can make decent skates with decent hardware at a $149.00 price point, other companies shouldn't sacrifice safety and follow suit.

I totally understand the idea around beginner skates and lower end gear to see if you like it. Thats what I did! However, poor quality skates at $90 that fall apart are disheartening, they make it harder to learn, and waste money. I wish I would have done research and learned about skates before buying them. Currently, I am STOKED to buy the Beach Bunnies to have a quality entry level skate I can trust. Even if they dont last as long as the Lollies or other brands. I can at least trust them. 

The plates on the Candi Grls are polypropylene so at any time, if I jump too hard just once, the heavy metal truck could crack them! The bottom of the boot is made of the exact same material with tiny little screws holding the plate on. The dual action trucks are a joke, and the cushions are rock solid hard plastic.  There is almost zero give when using your edges, and trying to turn. I can actually hear the boot stress and creak when I try. I've loosened the kingpin, checked my wheels and all that jaz. To no avail. 

The toe stop nut and bolt isnt anchored to anything,  the nut screws in to the bolt separated by a hole in the plate that is extremely thin. Again, scared to stop hard only to then crack the plate and hurt my self.

So yes, they are beginner skates and I have learned to skate with them, but paying $90 for 1 month is a rip off and I could've severely hurt my self.
