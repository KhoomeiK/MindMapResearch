First off, most people don't actually have an accurate conception of what a \~healthy\~ weight is, or even what a certain number looks like - if I asked the average person to guess someone's weight by appearance, or asked what an average weight for a person of a certain height was, I guarantee they'd answer with something wildly incorrect. So your therapist probably doesn't have much of a clue either.

Secondly, there's no \~healthy\~ weight for anyone, it depends on a lot of factors. Health has jack shit to do with a number on a scale, and we all think weight is so important but it's really not. Your therapist is a doctor for mental, not physical, illnesses, and I doubt that anything she's gonna say about weight is all that credible. She shouldn't be saying this stuff to someone with an ED anyway smh I'm not a therapist but even I would know better than to bring up any kind of a number.

You're doing fine, it's awesome that you are going to therapy (even if this instance with your therapist is making me very angry on your behalf) and please keep working on your recovery <3 Estimating your weight gets you nowhere good, I think not having a scale is a really great step and you deserve to keep moving towards progress and happiness for yourself despite any misguided comments from other people, even if they are your therapist <3"

I'm still scared of public speaking, but I used to be so much worse, to the point of leaving so I wouldn't be forced into it - it took years but I got better through practice. Constantly having to speak in public and get exposure to my fear really helped me to realize it's never as big a deal as I think it is. If I stutter or the slides take a minute longer to load than I expected, or something goes wrong, it's not a big deal - if I saw someone else bomb a presentation, I wouldn't think badly of them and tbh I'd forget it soon after I left the room, so chances are no one else is thinking negative thoughts about you either. I decided that I would deliberately put myself in projects and situations where I'd have to speak publicly, and though it was really scary and anxiety-inducing, I got through it and now it's not one of my biggest fears. Same thing with talking on the phone - I was forced to practice and now it doesn't stress me out anymore if I have to make a phone call. They both still get to me sometimes, and I like to listen to some confidence-boosting music, wear something I feel good in, or give myself a pep talk before I do the thing, and it usually helps a lot!

* Tofu scramble - [This is a good starting recipe for it.](https://itdoesnttastelikechicken.com/tofu-scramble-breakfast-vegan-champions/) You can sub in any vegetables/beans/mushrooms you like or have in your kitchen, and it's really good and filling. You can eat it on its own or use it as filling in a wrap.
* tbh since you're vegetarian and not vegan, you can do different ways of cooking eggs - scrambled, fried, omelettes, etc - especially with omelettes, you can add in veggies and mushrooms
* Stir fry! Any type of stir fry, you can use any kind of noodles you have on hand, and add vegetables and/or tofu - or just do a veggie stir fry and have it with rice
* veggie chili! it's super customizable and you can prepare it in advance and freeze it as well
* quesadillas - [I make them pretty much like this recipe and add in other vegetables if I feel like it](https://www.budgetbytes.com/hearty-black-bean-quesadillas/).
* pasta - you can buy sauce in a store or make your own if you want to, I usually buy pesto and add it to pasta with vegetables.
* burrito bowls - all you need are rice, tofu, beans, veggies and some salsa/guac/whatever else you want to put on there, it's very customizable based on what you're feeling that day
* tacos - you can use tofu, tempeh, seitan, other meat alternatives as a filling

Here are some good blogs / Youtube channels for recipes, just look around on there and see what looks appealing!

* [Budget Bytes - not strictly a vegetarian site, but I've linked the list of vegetarian recipes here. The site has a lot of great, low cost recipes with pictures and step by step instructions for each one.](https://www.budgetbytes.com/category/recipes/vegetarian/)
* [Pick Up Limes](https://www.pickuplimes.com/recipe-index) \- a vegan blog, also has a [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCq2E1mIwUKMWzCA4liA_XGQ) \- very aesthetic, easy to follow recipes - some are more complex than others but overall a great place to look for recipes
* [It Doesn't Taste Like Chicken](https://itdoesnttastelikechicken.com/) \- blog and youtube channel, recipes are vegan and designed to be easy/simple
* Cheap Lazy Vegan - youtube channel with cheap lazy recipes lol
* Edgy Veg - youtube channel with great recipes

* hot for food

* people have glow ups all the time, you haven't peaked yet don't worry
* also i think i'm ugly and unattractive af most of the time, but i also just had the thought that i've never seen someone else irl and went ""wow they're so ugly"" - at worst, they just look like a regular person and i'm not personally attracted to them, but i've never thought anyone looked bad. chances are no one else is thinking that about you either
* i know what it feels like to not be liked by anyone, it really really sucks and i wish i had better advice for dealing with it. please just know that you are enough and that you're very strong for having any clean streak of cutting in the first place - relapses happen and you can't blame yourself for them. over time, the clean streaks will get longer. keep going, you got this and i hope you feel better soon, sending hugs <3"

EDAnonymous,fem358k,t3_epsnte,1579238198.0,"Aww I'm so sorry :( I'm guessing she doesn't know about your ED? idk if she'd be more sensitive if she knew, that's always a shitty thing to say to someone. Soup sounds really nice and warm and comforting, you deserve soup and I hope therapy continues to help <3"
EDAnonymous,fem2w3t,t3_epu1bw,1579237959.0,"this is so relatable omg. it's so hard to hear people dieting for their new year's resolutions or right after the holidays, and so many people will say they're trying to eat healthier and are trying to avoid X food which sometimes is what i ate the day before or something so then i feel like crap for eating it. you're so strong and your journey of recovery has nothing to do with what other people are doing on their own journeys, good luck to you and stay strong <3"
EDAnonymous,fem2qdv,t3_eptlg5,1579237816.0,"good lord not only is it triggering but also it's just bad writing, like i get that they want to write vivid descriptions but that's not how necks or belts or necklaces or waists or literally anything work unless we're talking about an animated character

i'd have the exact same honest thoughts, they're irrational but they exist :("
BingeEatingDisorder,fellav6,t3_epre2w,1579224897.0,"I literally just did this a few minutes ago - I had a bag of chocolates from the holidays and meant to eat a couple and then put it away but the next thing I knew, the whole bag was gone. It's been a bad couple weeks and I was numb / felt no emotion today, and I usually binge when I'm upset about something so there wasn't really any reason for it. I don't know how to stop it but just know that you're not alone <3 Habits can be made and broken, so we can break this one"
EDAnonymous,feiuwtn,t1_feisoqu,1579147874.0,"I agree, but I think the distinction is that the mods and many users of that sub do a good job of emphasizing that 1200 calories/day is not for everyone and many people should eat more than that - but people with disordered eating go on the sub as well and some of the posts on there are reminiscent of this sub or of the safe food sub, and it kind of worries me when I see crossposts between all of them. I used to hang out over there to convince myself that calorie counting and restricted eating was normal, but I didn't realize the people on there were coming at calorie restriction with a much different view than I did. The mindsets behind the posts here and most posts over there are miles apart though, you're so right about that."
EDAnonymous,feiljij,t3_ep974q,1579141348.0,"usually it's last minute panic before the deadline that motivates me, but something that really helps is that I'll tell myself to work on it for x number of minutes, whatever I can handle at the time. So like I'll tell myself I'll work on it for 10 minutes, then if I want to stop I can but if I feel okay then I'll keep going. Usually I don't need to stop, because starting the work is the hardest part for me personally. I take a few deep breaths, count down from 10, set a timer, and start, and by the time the timer is up I feel fine continuing to work. I like the Pomodoro method too, you set work intervals and break intervals so for example, you'd work for 25 minutes, break for 5, work for 25, etc and every 4 work intervals you take a longer break of like 15 minutes - you can change those numbers to whatever works for you. It helps to think about just working for 25 minutes instead of thinking about getting all the work done, breaking it down into chunks makes it seem more manageable."
EDAnonymous,feikppb,t3_epa8x0,1579140788.0,so true. i made myself stop watching after like 2 episodes because it was fucking with me too much

EDAnonymous,feikf9a,t3_ep7vpq,1579140592.0,me too please! :)
BingeEatingDisorder,feik8hl,t3_epbcxj,1579140463.0,"yes. ""it's 11:52 pm and I'll start over tomorrow aka in 8 minutes so better get all the binging out of my system now"""
fuckeatingdisorders,feik5xc,t3_ep57rm,1579140414.0,"Wow you'd think a therapist would know more than that about eating disorders, holy shit. Can you ditch him and go to a professional therapist who specializes in eating disorders?

also that last paragraph really worries me, he shouldn't ever be looking at you like that but especially not after you just said you have an ED. what a scumbag i hope you find someone better"
depression,feijqmy,t3_ep89zd,1579140129.0,"Same, I tell them I'm fine because I don't want them to worry. They wouldn't understand anyway, so what's the point"
BingeEatingDisorder,feigqga,t1_fei4khg,1579138143.0,"yeah but it's like any other disease it happens and you just have to deal with it the best you can

when people get the flu no one's like ""i should be better than this but here i am coughing anyway,"" mental health struggles aren't any more your fault than physical sicknesses are. you can work on your mental health though, and slowly but surely you can get better and push yourself towards recovery and develop better coping techniques. it sounds like you're making some progress already, that's awesome and i hope the trend continues for you :)"
BingeEatingDisorder,feigf7v,t1_fei4em6,1579137936.0,"aww yeah ik how that is, I'll be browsing this sub while binging sometimes. 

and yay that's great!! progress is progress, give yourself some credit :)"
