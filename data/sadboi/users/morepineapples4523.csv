I loved him and this did not matter to me bc we had awesome sex. One of my favorite sexual partners to date actually, except when his hip bones started hurting me. Anywho. I attract a lot of male attention and because we were such an odd pair, when we were together it did not stop. In a way I have never experienced before, men of all kinds would challenge our relationship. Even if my ""gentleman callers"" figured out/knew/acknowledged or accepted that we were together, they would still hit on me, sometimes right in front of him. Definitely behind his back. I didn't like it. It made me wish that he wasn't so skinny. And then it became an issue. I was worried about him getting beat up and I didn't like that. I asked him to please gain weight several times and he refused, said he didn't see it as an issue. And I didn't want to hurt his feelings any further. Even though he had no problem telling me how much he liked me (& other women) thick-er. I told him tough shit, so to be fair, my weight was not subject to his preference either. However, now from the experience I am not into dating skinny men at all. I don't find it attractive. I think that I was attracted to this particular man despite his size. But I won't allow a relationship like this again bc I am not into it physically. He left a horrible taste in my mouth, that might have something to do with it. He and I remain friendly- surface friends. However, it didn't work out with us bc he is a quid pro quo lover and fuck that. Only boys and not men worry about being taken advantage of, in my opinion. I got a house and I was fixing it up. I am extremely handy and a quick study; He was a plumber and could have helped me out immensely. But he never did, bc someone ""always wanted something from him"". I truly do hate him for that. To me that is selfish.  When I think about how it would have been so easy for him to change my life (I didn't shower in my house for the first year DICK) and how he didn't do it, it still angers me. We've been friends since age 16 and he didn't become a plumber until over 10 years later. It wasn't like I baited him for that reason. That fucking dick."

bipolar,f4ue0cq,t1_f4uaw8h,1571807020.0,"It is possible that this is me too? I am unsure. There is a chance that I am not self aware enough to know if people are good for me. I always tell myself yes. I probably do have crazier thoughts when I am alone, but I am more content to follow my crazy whether it be good or bad when I am by myself. I don't want anyone to rain on my parade lol. So you're probably onto something."
bipolar,f4uaivv,t1_f4u7rp4,1571803708.0,"Nutzo question: why is isolation dangerous? I kind of force myself to be my own best friend, particularly when needy and hypomanic bc I will embarrass myself later. I have decided that when I am balls to the walls nuts, I don't want to leave impressions on people and also I am putting forth more of an effort to be self-reliant."

For example, ""would you mind checking on my son and seeing what he is up to. He like you more than me."" Or ""would you mind talking to Karen right now, she might feel a bit uncomfortable in this crowd/context. Could you do me a favor and make her feel welcome?"" Or ask him to get you something or do work. Eventually, he will learn to avoid you bc you always have tasks and missions for him to do, and nobody likes that lol"
BipolarReddit,f4thggw,t3_dleiql,1571788462.0,"When I am in the moment (of both) I would choose depression over hypomania. Bc at least I know what I am doing that day. And when depressed I spend most of my time asleep and when I am asleep, I don't feel anything. When I am hypomanic I am losing my mind, have an unstable perspective, spend the whole day up and down, not knowing what the hell I am doing or what the fuck I even want. Nothing, not even exercise can soothe me bc I can't stay focused long enough to exercise and then I freak out and start feeling guilty bc a lot of the things I have to do can be considered exercise and if I can come up with the energy to exercise, I should use that engery to multitask something important. I spend all day running around like an angry, needy, yet antisocial, chicken with my head cut off. It sucks. I stay like this for a day or two. I can stay depressed for a week at a time.

After a hypomanic episode however, I feel better about having accomplished something, even if living through the day was absolute hell. However after a depression, I feel like absolute shit about the dirtbag I was when I was depressed. Those feelings trigger a hypomanic transition stage usually ending with full blown mania until I burn out into depression, cycle repeats. But so far we are all in agreement, both suck."
BipolarReddit,f4tei6s,t1_f4q4iz8,1571787416.0,Thank you for your comment. I am going to use it as a silver lining reminder when I feel hypomanic. I value your perspective bc I've never thought about it that way
bipolar,f4taqkr,t3_dlngff,1571786065.0,"I get that. It is how I am with garbage day. I have to get the food garbage out bc if it sits in my can, raccoons will get it and make a mess. Everyday until the next garbage day. I am sorry to say that I live like a ferral slob and so in the rest of my tidying, the bare minimum is something I have trouble defining. I know that if my place is cleaner, I will feel better and then hopefully have less bad days to make up for in the future. I KNOW you are more clutter free than I am, but can you relate to this?"
bipolar,f4sk737,t1_f4scpkg,1571778320.0,"Do you have social anxiety? I am mostly introverted, although in true bipolar form, there is a version of me that is scary good at people and enjoys them. Most of the time though I have fallen so behind on chores that even if I were to go out, I wouldn't have a good time bc I would be thinking about how much many things I have to do at home and how I would find doing them more valuable than hanging out with people. The thing is, I will never catch up on chores. Ever. Can you relate to that?"

Bc of that, my sister and I can too. To get just as big as the person yelling at you was a necessity to being heard in our house growing up, whether or not one actually felt that strongly about the emotion at hand. Both my sister and I grew up to be diagnosed as bipolar although neither of my parents are."

BipolarReddit,f49qq2s,t3_djv4df,1571480477.0,"I think the important thing to remember, and where this disconnect is happening. Is this asinine behavior and self serving, self centered thing you describe IS the illness. That we make promises we can't keep is part of the diseased. bELIVE ME. That we do embarrassing things we regret is also part of the disease. So seeing shit like that lets me and others know they're not in it alone. Bc it is hard to live with yourself never living up to the ""potential"". Am I right? If i/we could control it we would. Life would be better. I wouldn't have to do so much explaining about how I am sorry I overcommitted and then quit without it being readily apparent I am mentally unstable. I have to do that atonement of shame tomorrow at a meeting with the cheftain of my program. If I don't justify my behavior. Somehow to myself, I will continue to beat myself up and hate my life forever holding on to the past fumbles. Wow. Writing this response made me sad. I only intended to help, but now. I just leave you with this thought: if I could do better. I WOULD. I TRY my fucking heart out. And I am so embarrassed and ashamed that I can't get better, but the truth is:bp is degenerative and all of us are only going to get worse with time. So it is important for us to embrace ourselves. Bc we only get 1 life, right. I can't spend it trying to live up to other people's expectations and judgements, fuck that. I have to eat shit for both my most manic and most depressed behavior. This sub is for this. These people get it. I encourage all honest Come one, come all. If you have to get it out. I will be your preheated audience bc I understand/can relate."
BipolarReddit,f35qvdk,t3_dfr2fz,1570686666.0,I read that book. And the sequel. I am still a hoarder. I keep junk bc I think I will make something from it. I actually just might. I am very unpredictable and an artist of all trades. It is my coping mechanism. Don't you wish cleaning was a realistic coping mechanism?

Ayahuasca,f35p3f5,t3_dfpf2l,1570684647.0,"Your life is going to suck for this cleanse. I admire your bravery. I went to Peru for a retreat with less than 24hrs notice and I had just gotten on Sertraline and Adderall. Also I am bipolar and have ADHD. Turns out that they do not recommend bipolar people to do ayahuasca. But bc I had just gotten on the meds (definitely not even working yet) I stopped them when I got to Peru. And in response to the bipolar, I sat infront of the shamans and they glared into my soul. I could feel them doing it. And while they were scanning me, my inner voice was screaming this is who I am,and allowing them access to all the parts of me. It was a very cool experience (under the influence of nothing). I passed their assessments but was closely monitored. And given a small dose the first time. I learned that my bipolar actually called for a larger dose than most and a second serving. My body just burns through it I guess.  And when I was discussing why I felt I needed more, I described it as being unable to enter the dimension. And frustrating. I wish I had the opportunity to follow the dieta. But also grateful I didn't have to, mostly bc I feel like I would fail and it would suck. I dont need to feel like a failure at anything else"

The only thing I can do to feel better is to get shit done. Productivity makes me happy. But housework does not. I will be cleaning until I die. It's to the point that whenever I feel happy/manic, that bitch is stuck with all the grunt work depression me hasn't done. It gets to me in the present and looking back at how I spend my time I am sad I don't do more fun things, bc I don't have time. And the shitty things I have to do keep piling up. I haven't had worry/guilt free fun in years. They don't make drugs to deal with that. If you know them, tell me."
