Non-binary identities are out there and there is a lot of freedom when it comes to gender identity. I'm a trans man, I was born female but I hate every biological female part of my body while heavily identifying with male characteristics. There are also lots of non-binary people out there that were born female at birth that hate every biological female part of their body that don't identify with male characteristics, there are no rules!

mentalillness,fnqpoz9,t3_g3ae1w,1587169508.0,"I feel exactly the same way. I'm a lazy piece of shit who doesn't push myself to do anything. I didn't graduate highschool, thought it was going to be a big deal but it wasn't. I was able to find a diploma that would've helped me get what I needed to graduate, I dropped out of that though. Then a year later I found another diploma that was something I thought I was interested in which didn't require highschool graduation, dropped out of that though too. Things are out there for people that don't graduate highschool. Your life path might not look the same as those that do graduate but it doesn't really matter. Highschool isn't your last shot, you can try again as many times as you need to. Hell I still haven't graduated or gotten any qualifications in 2 years but I've let myself off the hook because I know I just need to take it slow and find something that fits. You'll be ok. Hang onto your love for your brother's, they'll really appreciate it if you pull through. They're more important than any societal education shit. I was suicidal for my last two years of highschool, didn't tell my therapist and every Friday as I sat alone at lunch I would think to myself 'I'm gonna do it this weekend'. It got to Sunday night and I just went to sleep instead, turns out being lazy kinda saved my life. Things aren't better now, but they're different. I can still see my siblings and I'm grateful for that. Sorry for the rant, you got this."

I think he is scared to accept me as his son, just as your parents may be too, fear is holding him back. He always says to me that he's doing this and saying these things because in 20 years if I feel like transitioning was/is the wrong thing for me he will be there to take me back as his daughter. He's twisted his non-acceptance in a way that makes him feel like he actually is supporting me so he doesn't ever have to face the truth.

He compares it to women being insecure about their breast size or not being happy with their noses which I've told him is such a different thing. At this point I feel like even if I try to have an open, honest conversation about it all he does is go into defensive mode, not listening to me and throwing excuses about 'why I might be feeling this way' so it just feels like a lost cause. He is a brick wall, in total denial. Like before I went on T and we talked about it, I would say that the deeper voice would help me feel a lot better and he would just hit back with 'yeah but why change it, just learn to accept your voice as it is'.

I think the main thing is that now for the first time I have memories to look back on and recognise that they happened. When I was 10 I didn't really have that, or now I don't think I did, so I didn't feel the anxiety I feel now.

I feel like time doesn't really matter. It feels like I'll be 80 tomorrow because time passes so quickly, there's no substance to it. When I'm 80 I'll look back on this moment of me typing this out and feel like it was yesterday."
