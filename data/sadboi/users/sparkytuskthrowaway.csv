witchcraft,fpwnra0,t1_fpwn25s,1588966696.0,I don't even believe it's real so like switch lion with carnivorous unicorn. I just wanna check the validity of it. I suspect it's all mental.
socialmedia,fpq8gj2,t1_fpq88rw,1588817284.0,OKAY. Then why THE FUCK do you have a flare that says ... AHEM 'Customer Support'?! Do you understand how contradictory and STUPID that is?!
Minecraftbuilds,fopfclr,t3_g8nl95,1587960052.0,It's a masterpiece. Well done good sir.
NoFap,foper7v,t1_fope55n,1587959634.0,I'll check it out.
NoFap,fopept1,t1_fope3pt,1587959606.0,I've read some consequences of fapping without cumming like your body releases it eventually in different ways. Is there a way to do it in a healthy way?
infp,fom7fx8,t3_g7w1qj,1587880532.0,I find myself in that position all too often.
woooosh,fom7c9l,t3_g7tje9,1587880442.0,Hahaaa my dumb countrymen. Harharharharharhar!
Anxiety,fom77hs,t3_g3kf5x,1587880326.0,Yeah. But it's because people depend on me. I can't live dangerously. Ima man with responsibility. I've got to be smart and live a controlled calculated life. I can literally just lay down and die happily anywhere at any time - if not for the weight of responsibility on my shoulders. There be people that need me alive.
Fallout,fnfmais,t3_g1cjv3,1586910884.0,Imo Fallout 76 is a top notch multiplayer game but the reviews are justified. Most are complaining about the price and they are right. $60 for a multiplayer fps game is outrageous. It strikes me as a $20 game at the most.
Paranormal,flytjfb,t1_flyi882,1585608810.0,Alright. Well thanks anyway.
Paranormal,flyo2sq,t1_flyho3v,1585605785.0,Thanks. That is helpful advice.

infp,fho93b4,t1_fho7sa5,1581745855.0,"Oh me too, which is probably one of the reasons that we avoid social interaction so much. This basically described me ""They are easily misunderstood and since they arent real talkative people make assumptions and gossip and before they know it they have no friends and dont know why"" and ""Infpâ€™s love the idea of people, love to study them from a far, but because they are often misunderstood many avoid interacting to protect themselves from hurt."""

Agoraphobia,famkt0d,t1_falqfla,1576206267.0,"If I'm honest, I'm unlikable too. I deal with social awkwardness and I really can't talk around people. But it doesn't matter because I genuinely don't like people."
Agoraphobia,falyvnq,t1_falqfla,1576192840.0,I doubt that. You seem cool to me. Sure they don't just like talking to you because you're a chill person?
Agoraphobia,falxdtx,t1_falqfla,1576192098.0,You're interesting and there's nothing wrong with being weird or awkward. You just gotta find your kind've people.
Agoraphobia,faltfgr,t1_falrhpt,1576190155.0,"Yeah me too. It's like every time I try to interact with people, they eventually find out that I'm not as outgoing, then they proceed to show me why I shouldn't be more outgoing."
Agoraphobia,falscu1,t1_falqfla,1576189638.0,I use to feel inferior all the time. Then I just realized I don't like people. You're probably the same.

Insurance,f6ql9k7,t1_f6q2hrj,1573079799.0,1. 2. and 3. are likely because it was apparently the driver's girlfriend's brother's car and she was freaking out about how upset he's gonna be. Although he did say something about exchanging insurance information before the cop arrived. After i went back to my car and filled out the statement form that's when he drove off. The car had some dents.
sex,f30k9l7,t1_f30h5x6,1570556225.0,True.
