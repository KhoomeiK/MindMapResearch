mentalhealth,fqju72i,t3_galuo4,1589415257.0,"I’ve had this issue, i still feel it now but back when I was a kid it was really bad. I’d think my schoolmates, or movie characters, were watching through photos I had hung on my wall, so I better be on my best behavior. I’d also talk out loud. Once i moved into a dorm at age 15, I basically forced myself to stop because I had a roommate and couldn’t let myself be weird in front of them. Even now I still constantly feel watched... maybe it’s because I’m always around people and getting snuck up on. Now in my 30s it feels more like a paranoia rather than a way of interacting or expressing myself, if that makes sense. Last year I got super paranoid and I went outside to calm down, only to catch a burglar with an ankle monitor in my backyard trying to get into our shed, so it doesn’t help when I get my concerns confirmed. Also now my talking is now just at other people when I’m hypomanic rather than to these people."

bipolar2,fqameke,t1_fqalowg,1589221535.0,"Some of it has been medication making me less anxious and depressed. When I’m severely anxious or depressed, I can’t really do any of this stuff. Everything seems difficult. But when things are manageable again I have strict routines that I’ve made through a lot of practice and timers on my phone. I also get hyper focused on occasion which still makes me have bad focus on anything else - last year I became obsessed with self help to a point in which my doctor said I was “too good” which made me think I was overdoing it. I read a lot of books, watched YouTube, etc. and looked for ways of improving my life with efficiency."
bipolar2,fqaj3fp,t3_ghqwux,1589219927.0,"My bad focus was the reason I sought help, because I thought it must be ADHD or something. Psychiatrist said it was just my really bad anxiety and bipolar disorder. My brain is either moving a mile a minute or I’m just trapped in my own anxious thoughts. I did end up on Vyvanse for my binge eating and although it helped, it made my heart rate go through the roof and contributed to some episodes I had. I do miss the energy it gave me but it was sometimes more like nervous energy.

One thing I do to help combat it, I carry around a small notebook everywhere to keep myself on track. I’ve filled probably 4-5 of them so far. I’ve got lists, pages of notes, I’ve rewritten recipes so I can complete them better because I can’t focus on scrolling up and down on recipes on my phone, things like that. Kind of like a Bullet Journal.

It also helps that I have people who help me realize I’m moving too fast or getting unfocused and get me back on track. Mostly at work. I’m open about my diagnosis and my coworker is so helpful."

My doctor wants me to try to come off of seroquel because honestly I’m not sure what it’s actually doing for me and she doesn’t want me to stay on an antipsychotic. I’m also on lithium.

I’ve been working on myself but nothing got to me the way going back to the Catholic Church did. I always struggled with things like meditation, but the Rosary definitely helped me with my prayer life and also calmed my mind a lot. I do it as often as I can. Sometimes on days where I have to take my nighttime medication, I’ll straight up fall asleep sitting up holding my rosary because I’m so determined to finish. I also read the gospels for the first time in their entirety which made a huge difference for me. I’m still getting back into the faith after having lapsed for about 10 years. I also immediately went to confession and it was soooo cathartic. I cried so much and felt so relieved. I started attending adoration before the church got closed down for covid. Of course my commitment to myself for lent was to go to mass and adoration and well, we saw how that worked out, but I still make dedicated time to work on my faith regardless. 

Also, therapy is always great. I see someone locally but I looked into one of those online ones like Better Help and they had the option to request a therapist who is Catholic so your therapy is based around that as well."

Now we are considering a different medication since it’s still bad. I tend to tell myself I’m worthless and everyone at my job hates me, that I’m going to do a terrible job when I go in or someone will yell at me (I work retail... during this pandemic I’m working as customer service/answering high volumes of calls instead of my normal job as a sales manager).

Catholicism,fpn95cz,t3_ge9opz,1588754581.0,"I completely understand you. Just my two cents since I have/had a similar situation:

I recently went back to being a practicing Catholic after a 10 year gap where I had become an atheist and fallen into a deep depression. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Then my dad died just days before my birthday last year.

It’s been about 8 months since then and I miss him every single day. I remember how scared I was to tell him I was converting as I had grown up Lutheran just as him. He didn’t mind at all, he said “as long as you don’t stop believing”. And then I did. Those words ring loud in my head a lot because I did and I still struggle to this day especially when I am depressed. That’s when I work the hardest on it. 

For the first time ever I read the gospels in their entirety. Now I’m moving onto other books, both NT and OT. I immediately started praying the rosary. I love it for a couple of reasons, mostly that it is very meditative and I need that in my life right now. I also immediately went to confession which was very therapeutic and helped me actually talk to God again. 

One thing that helped me was Lizzie’s Answers on YouTube. She is Catholic and has bipolar too, so she has some great videos on depression and faith. The most important thing I learned from her was that you can pray even if you don’t “feel” God sometimes. Work hardest at it when times are tough. Then it occurred to me that’s really what faith is all about anyway. Even when I’m in a pit of despair, thats when I pray hardest and it’s been really making a difference. 

Just before quarantine, when I started going back to mass, I started lighting a candle for my dad every time and attending adoration as well. I pray for my dad all the time. 

Next on my list is to read St Teresa of Avila’s book The Interior Castle as I’ve read it really talks about how a good prayer life can lead to improved faith. 

Now I will pray for you. I am so sorry you are going through this. I’m sure other folks have more helpful stories but know you aren’t alone."

BipolarReddit,fgucivn,t1_fgu6jb7,1581117499.0,"I also lost my father last year and recently had an existential crisis while on Latuda. My anxiety was so severe and I was crying all day about all of the pain in the world. The wildfires in Australia were devastating to me. I also have a hard time dealing with the thought of dying and not existing anymore. I think about it a lot. To cope I’ve been using my hypomania to binge read philosophy, Zen Buddhism and religion of all kinds to try to find some sense in it all. Plus reading about death in general. Thankfully I’m coming off Latuda right now and should be starting lithium tomorrow. Wish me luck. And good luck to you as well. I’m sorry about your father. It sucks. A lot."
bipolar2,fgr7v0e,t3_ezt2ts,1581040295.0,"This works for me usually, but I have one medication that it somehow makes more expensive."
BipolarMemes,fgn2of6,t1_fglzvh8,1580936537.0,"I wish I could do that. I work retail and my “desk/office” is right at the front of my department open to the public. lol.

This also explains why I react the way I do when my fiancé makes sounds. Which he likes to do a lot. A lot a lot."
BipolarReddit,fgebncp,t3_exybwt,1580695878.0,"That’s really awesome and gives me a lot of hope. I’ve failed 4 medications now and we are finally going to try lithium, which my doctor is really confident will work but she usually uses it as a last resort. I’ve been miserable and I’m so looking forward to trying it and hoping it brings stability to my life like it has to yours. Thank you."
BipolarReddit,fg59eku,t3_ewu2vw,1580521604.0,I recently started Latuda and I’m already coming off of it after 3 weeks because it made me super irritable and then I deep dove into a severe depression. It was the most awful hopeless feeling I’ve ever had. So as of today I’m coming off and I will be transitioning to another medication.
Anxiety,fg322ib,t3_ewbhpn,1580466744.0,Hilarious. My fiancé and I just discussed today that he clenches his jaw and I tighten my shoulders. We were both doing so as I read this aloud.
bipolar2,ffpkoef,t3_etkyvr,1580097377.0,I’ve been crying off and on daily for the last week too. It’s exhausting. I don’t even know why half the time.
AnimalsBeingJerks,ffk90v0,t3_etyuet,1580018949.0,"An Emu chased me once sometime in 1998. There are two pages in my childhood scrapbook dedicated to it. Thanks, mom. Oh and I recently found my Lisa Frank diary with a summary of the event. Best find ever."
BipolarReddit,ffjtzfm,t3_eu0k65,1580006888.0,I had this same reaction to Lamictal. I talked to my doctor because it dumbed me down. I was forgetting sentences talking with my customers - embarrassing. Due to other side effects as well I needed up changing medication completely.
Survival,ffjjw5y,t3_etrek0,1579999894.0,I bought one of these for my fiancé. I think now I want it more than he does. It’s beautifully made and works very well.
BipolarReddit,ffjdyet,t3_etpqr5,1579996249.0,I had to fail two medications before my insurance company would pay for Vraylar because it’s not available in generic and would be $1500. Then I failed it as well. I’m like you in that I’m always trying so hard and I’m consistent with everything I do. I’m on a short term medical leave for work while we work on my meds. How many meds before I finally find something that will help and how much will it cost? Who knows.
news,ffae4l0,t1_ff9hcpr,1579733466.0,I’m still waiting for my 120 hours of vacation hours to get paid out through bankruptcy court FOUR YEARS LATER. Literally the worst. Sorry for anyone else who has gone through this.
BeardedDragons,ff4jbue,t3_erj58u,1579564988.0,Cute! I love the little arrows
bipolar2,ff4j73k,t3_eri2it,1579564897.0,"I was like that the other day when I was coming down. I was full of anger and apathy. I tried to do a 5 minute gratitude meditation and I was angry the whole time so it felt pointless. I cried myself to sleep and I had no idea why. Today is better but damn, I understand."
bipolar2,ff4ipw9,t3_erkc2u,1579564571.0,I switched to a low from feeling great just a couple days ago. Spent two days crying for no reason. I totally get it. It sucks. I’m on a medical leave from my job right now and I have so much free time to actually enjoy but when I get like that I just can’t and it sucks. Today I’m feeling better. I hope you do soon as well.
sewing,fety175,t3_eqfvy5,1579381178.0,I just went on a two hour rabbit hole search of things I can make and places I can donate to. Thank you so much for posting this. Seeing all the good that people are doing helps with the pain of knowing so many animals need help. ❤️
bipolar,felml1e,t3_epoic0,1579225778.0,Hahahaha I have one of those Fugglers! My bearded dragon has taken a liking to it and so it’s now her pillow at night. The teeth is what makes them so creepy.
bipolar2,fel1srh,t1_fekuxxp,1579212207.0,That’s my favorite thing to do when I’m anxious... just set a 10-20 min timer and go crazy tidying! Makes me feel better.
MadeMeSmile,fe637k8,t3_enpl89,1578880765.0,"The only time I ever went out by myself, I made a friend in the bathroom and she got me free drinks the rest of the night. The women’s bathroom is a magical place."
bipolar2,fdyo436,t3_endf4j,1578781823.0,Sped up cleaning is so satisfying. Thank you.
