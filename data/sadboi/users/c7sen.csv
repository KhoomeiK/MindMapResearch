Tinder,f8cxumx,t3_e088g9,1574472432.0,"I made a bet with my friend ( f, 22) to see who would get more matches in 1 day
So the day is over and i got 1 match and she didn’t reply to me afterwards as usual :’D.. 
my friend got more than 50 matches and 5 super likes knowing that she was really picky (she swiped right 1 out of 10 guys i would happily date as a man :’D no kappa, on the other side i swiped right all the girls till the last one) 
So it’s not about us being so shit..but it’s how this shit runs..you as a man (and another 100 man) get to offer 1 girl for a night out so she has the opportunity to pick whoever she finds suitable even if its criteria depends on some silly shit like having the perfect body or looking like a Hollywood pornstar :’D 
I don’t know what else to say but i think you got the point."
