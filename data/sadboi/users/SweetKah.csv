depression,etv38g1,t3_cdgwtu,1563225376.0,"Imagine... It was my mom's birthday... My ex boyfriend, ex mother in law, grandma, uncle and mom (obviously) was there in my mom's appartment. She went to the market to buy a cake and food stuff to make the lunch. My familly was talking when mom called my cellphone and asked for help with taking the stuffs out of the car. Me and my ex went to the car and my mom went up the stairs with some bags, me and my ex got the rest. I didn't like to go up the stairs first because I felt unconfortable of someone seeing my butt so closely and almost sniffing it. So I asked him to go first. I was with the bag with the cake inside. He insisted that I go first, then already mad, I did it. In the freaking second step my allstar got stucked in the stair tile and I fell right on top of the bag with the cake. Everything happened so fast that I went up all the stairs, reaching the appartment, dropping the bags and locking myself in the bedroom. After about 2 minutes my ex reached the appartment too, laughing so hard that he hardly walked. I was so red, like a tomato, and he explained everything to my familly. The cake turned into a Pave and I was so shy that I didn't talked the entire lunch."
depression,etv1ad7,t3_cd6d58,1563224175.0,"It's so hard being alive lately. I was so motivated with some projects like pixelated plataform games. I was going to develop some simple and funny game, one of my dreams was to be a game dev. Anyway, I worked on it for something like 4 days and gave up. I wanted to be a digital artist/illustrator, and I draw for few minutes and stop, because I can't draw as I wanted to even having some drawings, I think I'll never be noticed. I was working for something like 2 months and stopped, because I was having anxiety crysis, I was working because I wanted to have some nice stuffs to my house and help my husband with the bills. My life happens around ups and downs all the time. I'm luckly married with such an awsome man that makes everything to make me happy. He's depressed too, like me, but he's always pushing me up. Always when good things happens in my life, I just feel apathetic, I just know that something is good, but can't feel anything good, so It keeps myself down and it's hard to get motivated. I feel that I'm such a loser sometimes, I have dreams and feelings, and my dreams are just dreams and I'll not realize them... This is how motivated I'm right now, and lately. I'm feeling like that 2 years almost 3 years now. I'm afraid that I'll expend my whole life being like that and doing nothing, just being my husband's parasite."
depression,etuzd97,t3_cdl8jc,1563223055.0,"It made me cry, I just feel that way... It's hard to being alive with all those feelings... Sometimes I think have depressed, ill friends, just like me is better than normal ones, being so deep and sincere all the time, being theirselves, wearing no masks... I have no friends anyway, It's always that same thing... It's always like being stuck in this poem everyday."
depression,etuyus4,t3_cdfoto,1563222754.0,"Me and my husband just gave up of getting friends. Always get disappointed and sad. No one call us, remember us, and those things. It's hard to live without friends, at least we have each other. But yes, I feel it everyday. Feeling lonely, having no one to tell about problems or excited things instead of my husband that suffers with depression too... We don't go outside, hangouts or friends to go somewhere... Is that edible? I really don't know what is it to have friends... Sometimes I think that I'm such a horrible person that no one wants to be near. And being around so toxic people is being dumb. Better to be alone than with that toxic people. It doesn't makes you better, they are just pushing you down, so give up these people and get someone that is not that toxic, BTW."
depression,etuyjgg,t3_cdg8le,1563222572.0,"I pretty understand what do you feel... I used to sleepwell when my entire familly was alive, I had no worries with life and things, until I lost my entire familly... I'm so afraid to sleep and die sleeping, leaving everything behind, my husband, my pets, the feel of being myself, even with depression. I can't sleep in the dark and in the silence. My head just keep buzzing and the death will reach me... I turn some weak lights on and keep watching youtube until I fall asleep. Them, it's hard to wake up and live another day with such suffering inside me... Well, at least I'm not alone. My husband who have depression too is always pushing me up and ""protecting"" me from the Evil. I cannot work anymore, I can't! My body just don't move outside. It's terrifying for me. Here in Brazil medics and teraphy are expensives asf. It's hard to live in a world with bad people and with ""normal"" people that just can't understand how is to be ill. I have the hunting feeling when I'm having an anxiety crysis. And if I blink my eye, I will be dead. I fighting through this strugling and feelings like 2 years. It's not easy, but I learned just a little bit how to fight it. Get distracted with games, like Overwatch (It really helped me in my worst phase), now some Heroes of the Storm or casual games like Stonehearth, Hearthstone. Get some tea, put some warmclothes, get in my bedroom with cozy lights and leave some youtube's videos that I like in background while I play. So its easier to get distracted to not explode in a crysis. My husband helps me a lot too... I really wish you to get better. Get a new job or vacations. My heart just breaks to read that post, knowing that someone is suffering like I suffered a lot in my whole life. I'm 23 and It's getting harder, sometimes better.... Well, nothing lasts forever. As my husband says, death is some of the most beautifull things in the world. All the suffer and pain just go away. But I disagree... I think death is just suffering and gore, makes me remember my mom, grandma and uncle deaths right in front of my eyes, and it's GORE AND PAINFULL and DESPERATE. But one thing is right: We are stronger than those normal persons that thinks life is easy and just falls down with few things. We have such strenght inside ourselfs, that we have to be proud of it. The ill makes us stronger."
depression,etux53d,t1_etunuq1,1563221766.0,"There's a single person in the world who have not depression? Lately things are getting worse, until explode and no one cares anymore to anything. I'm struggling and I don't recognize myself. My TRUE SELF. Me and my husband always wear masks to the others. We both just know each other like no ones know... It's hard to have depression and other feelings that ""normal"" people can't understand."
