AskHistorians,fj4pg13,t1_fj4npk3,1583013735.0,Oh awesome! Thank you for the reading suggestions! And thank you for the information it was super helpful and informational!
AskHistorians,fj4od2q,t1_fj4kj34,1583012987.0,Oh my gosh!! Thank you so much for the extensive and detailed reply! That was extremely informational. I mean of course game play elements aside I’m glad we get to see a good representation of at least the Architecture and surroundings of that time. I went to Greece when I was 13 and defiantly didn’t appreciate what I was seeing when I was there. I find it so fascinating that archeologists can tell so much from so little (at least in my definition of little). Again thank you so much for the information!

solotravel,f7od726,t3_dx281i,1573925487.0,I don’t know if someone already said it but get a Copenhagen card! It gets you on all the public transportation and into the museums for free. It even gets you on a river boat cruise and discounts on most attractions

depression,ett88d2,t3_cd6d58,1563168102.0,Now to preface I am not any kind of licensed professional: I had thins same thing happen to me. I’d go a few days feeling meh then hit like rock bottom for a week then I’d get back up to meh. The cycle kinda continued from there. But long story short I was given a name for it. Bipolar 2 or just Bipolar Depression. It makes you swing 90 degrees instead of 180. So you never get that high you just sometimes get meh
RedDeadOnline,ets7ocn,t1_ets7h5r,1563138554.0,Seriously though! I’m glad other people have heard it because at first I thought I was going crazy
