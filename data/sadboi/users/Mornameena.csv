AskReddit,fplbnow,t3_gdzb3i,1588709832.0,"I was a bit of a social butterfly in middle school. I would go to the bathroom and do a lap around the school before coming back to class. Never bothered any of my teachers. I think they knew it would help me focus through the rest of class. 

There was a crotchety old bitch that taught 10 grade social studies and I wound up in her class. She was a nazi about taking longer than two minutes for a pee break. 

Went to the bathroom one day, still doing up my button coming out of the stall when she charged in grabbed my arm and DRUG me back to class while scolding me like I had done something wrong. Literally pulling me the whole way. I was dumbfounded and didn’t really make a fuss but thinking back that wasn’t fucking cool. 

My friend put a tack on her chair after that."
AskReddit,fpjuuy3,t3_gdn8w2,1588681611.0,"Hit them. 

I love my parents. But they were fucked. 

I remember getting upset while I was alone as a small child, I would hit myself as hard as I could. In the chest, in the face, anywhere really. That feeling still makes me cry to remember. I was never allowed to have emotions as a kid. So when I did, I would punish myself like they punished me. 

They have calmed down over the years so I’m proud of them but I never want my child to be in the place I am now. I want to have a healthy relationship with them but there is a lot of resentment I have to deal with and a lot of forgiving."

I think he has a touch of people pleaser in him so it made this shitty side of me come out more? He has stood up for himself in the past and I encouraged it. I asked him not to put up with me when I’m like that and give me feed back, never just take it. I have also started being grateful for everything. That helps.

His wife (s/o stepmom) is a saint who cooks beautiful meals and cleans everything up and she can NEVER do anything right. She can’t even tell us her own stories right, even when she’s got us all in stitches he’s sitting there furrowing his brow trying to think of something shitty to say to her and if he can’t think of something he just talks over her. 

One time there was a bunch of us at their house and we ordered sushi from a very sweet well known restaurant in town and for some reason he opened the bag and decided they forgot a roll so he calls them, in-front of everyone like he’s in his own stupid show of some kind, acts like a complete child, yelling and demanding they give us our money back because this is such an inconvenience to him only to go silent when his daughter shows him everything was In fact there. His kids are almost scared of him so I was the only one to laugh and roll my eyes which then caused me to get the death glare but fuck, oh well, if you’re going to act like a fuck head I’m not going to let you feel ok about it.

That sort of situation happens EVERY SINGLE TIME we see them. Oh god, I can’t even get into going into public with him. He’s such a phoney, tail between his legs, sad little bitch of a male(he’s not a man to me) when he wants to make a “good impression”.
