ptsd,f2uog68,t1_f2uob5o,1570422621.0,I am sorry to hear that. I hope you get rid of your triggers soon. Wish you the best.
CPTSD,f2uo5sd,t1_f2uh3p7,1570422340.0,"Hey, first: Also gratulations to your succesful art exhibit! Sounds like it was a huge success.

Regarding your crying... you said you felt like an asshole? why? Just a wild guess, but did you ever check the imposter syndrome? That you feel like you were fooling thema nd you?"
CPTSD,f2unzpv,t3_de6y21,1570422174.0,"Oh yeah, in a phase I was always running between it wasn't so bad to.... yeah... how DID I survive?  
I feel you so much on this. 

Also the lack of feeling you describe is a typical symptom of supressing memory... and hidden trauma."
ptsd,f2untgi,t3_de507r,1570422006.0,"I learned letting your mind wander a bit might cause unpleasant pictures, but it dampens the blow of the night. Even so far of not make those horrible nights happen. Its like letting off steam of a vent under pressure. Just a bit... again and again.

I hope you are well and recovering."
CPTSD,f2un1jb,t3_debh1n,1570421245.0,"Breathe. Do the breathing techniques you were taugh and just try to breathe.

I agree absolutely with cilantroprince. They will be okay, maybe not as good as with you around, but they will be alright.

The best thing you really can do for them is getting healthy agian. Fully. By faking it and returning to early, you would just fall even harder and the recovery would take even longer.  
So the most smart thing to do right now: Is to get healthy and to full strength... and get rid of that pesky CPTSD once and for all. So you can take care of them for the rest of your life."
ptsd,f2umonv,t3_decl9l,1570420908.0,"For me the best  way to describe depression how everythign becomes more and more grey. Like everything taste less bit by bit... songs don't sound as good bit by bit... and so on.

Also a lack of motivation to do anything. Treatment can often reduce the symptoms... but it is unwise to immediately rush back into life. You should properly remove the trauma, as this is the only way to truly cure yourself of it and any symptoms. Then yes, all symptoms are gone and you are no longer affects by the trauma or any triggers. It is definetely owrth the work and time you put in it.

Sadly treatment isn't as good as it should be and soemtimes hard to get. But is luckily not automatically needed."

ptsd,f2uh3h2,t1_f2uf65p,1570416381.0,I usually use the metaphor of walking in the storm and being hit by stuff brought from the storm out of nowhere... not that walking in the storm wasn't hard enough.
ptsd,f2ue0hz,t1_f2ucsp7,1570414117.0,It does :) It is an enormous help to finally understand what is going on. Otherwise its just like being hit by things out of nowhere.

Full outbreak: Hallucinations/shadows hunting oyu, feeling of your chest being ripped open, constant (even at home) fear /scared to death, connection lost to your body, loss of control of emotions, and so much more.

We have several methods to calm ourselves down. Be it a mantra, yoga, progressive muscle relaxation, breathign exercises, grounding and so much more. Look into them ASAP to calm you down."

I am not just symptom free ... that is when I started to do the digging... and that was good. Otherwise the nightmare jsut returns... stronger ... when you are weaker.

Of how I recovered I will be a bit lazy and copy the answer I gave a few hours ago ... sry:  
 

""Of course. Well a VERY short summary:

I first learned to manage my energy. I cut out EVERYTHING, that wasn't immdiately neccessary.

Then  I tried to understnad what all happened to me (which was a lot over a  decade abuse) and followed the 5 steps of grieving. Once I stabilized  myself enough and had enough energy put to the side I continued.

Then I realised  that the triggers I had were actually a way to get to the core of the  trauma. Also I realised my C-PTSD was made of many many smaller traumas.  So the impossible, became possible - if taking a while.

Then  I dissected my triggers to get to the trauma... and understand what  happened and why it was traumatic to me. (A simple one: threatening to  kill me -> loosing control of my own right to live, etc.).  
The key component was the question: Why?  
After  hte first success I kept on going until there was nothing left. Which  each trauma cleared, I got more energy and my symptoms overall lessend.

Once I was healed, I went to search for the remainder traumas (sleeper agents so to speak) and elimated them.  
Which  lead to my survivors guilt, as I was the only one I coudl find who was  able to do it... and started helping other who suffer the same fate.

After  that I rehabilitated myself (those years were agony with attacks from  family, society and so on) and then I needed to relearn normal. As the  abuse, etc. learned me a lot of WRONG things.

Then I treated the trauma of being abondend and left to die once my CPTSD came out - I know - lovely isn't it?  
And  since then I have been cured - except the survivor's guilt, which made  it for me impossible to do anythign else thatn helping those around me.  Though it doesn'T has any symptoms anymore, I can still feel it. That  one is still a work in progress.  
And yeah... helped 2 other peopel so far be cured of PTSD.

If you have any more questions, feel free to ask :)"""
CPTSD,f2u564x,t3_de9pie,1570407625.0,"I was the exact same boat. Got the diagnosis around the same age... realized it cost me my kid years, my teenage years and my twenties... the times that were supposed to be most fun in life. I felt like I missed out half of my life... I told this my father and he chuckled and asked me ""So you think that i am almsot dead?"" (he was close to 60)... that really opened my eye. maybe it helps you too a bit.

But even after I am cured... a bit of it remains... I lost so much and have so much catching up to do. But I am also now deeply rooted in myself and have no more baggage... I can live with myself in peace. And I will have children... with partner or without.

I would definetely prefer it with partner... but sadly we woman have a clock against us.

Focus on gettign healthy... I hope your truama isn't as bad as mine and you get back into life soon. But don't return too soon or you will just be automatically back into it... and loose even more time."
ptsd,f2u45ey,t3_de9d9e,1570406846.0,"That is great...

but supressing only works part time. If you really want to be free, you have to remove this event from your life."
ptsd,f2u41dn,t3_de5lkh,1570406762.0,"That is actually a pretty classic reason to have PTSD.

But it seems it hasn'T become really active yet, but good that you take action now. It is way easier to heal or cure if you do react in time.

Best to you on your path of healing."
ptsd,f2u2n2g,t1_f2u1xmp,1570405763.0,"A trigger is a connection the body made to something harmless and made it life threatening.

YOu must understand the cause of that thing becoming the trigger (which apparently you do... the electro shocks? - tbh I am not sure I understood you correctly). Then remove the lethal assoziation with it. Which is a bit tricky. but I would go down the route of... Why? Why did those electro shocks have such a strong influence on oyu? That is the path I would go down. Never stop asking why... facts don't matter, only feelings do.  
As triggers are caused by emotiosn not facts... facts only help to navigate it...

I hope this crashcurs what somewhat helpful"
ptsd,f2u1ky7,t3_de9a26,1570404997.0,"Sounds like a trigger to me. The only way to stop it from happening - is to remove it.

Do you know how?"
ptsd,f2tzum3,t3_de51nd,1570403773.0,"Glad you made another step in your recovery process.

It is definetely not... but letting go is. 

Because as long as you hold a grudge or the like, you still have him/her in your everyday life. There will be no grand justice... let it go... and never interact with them again. 

The best for your future journey."

I managed to cure myself, you can do it too. But it is long nad hard way.
