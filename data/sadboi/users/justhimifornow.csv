And also songs by The Childlike Empress. They both have expressed about their mental health and interpersonal issues in their songs and maybe you could listen to them to relate a little maybe."
BorderlinePDisorder,f9rpsuv,t3_e5n5lm,1575579608.0,"Just fought with two friends. The only reason I am sane now is that I use the BPD symptoms to cope with the fact that my feelings are exaggerated and what I am thinking is due to BPD. I also feel like finally, I have a good cocktail of meds that work for me. 

I hope you see yourself as worthy of all the good in life. Also, a nerdy quote from Lord of the Rings that my cousin repeats to me:

Frodo : What are we holding on to, Sam?

Sam : That there’s some good in this world, Mr. Frodo. And it’s worth fighting for."
BorderlinePDisorder,f9rojo0,t3_e5s1xw,1575579130.0,"For a second when I was reading this, I had to check if I wrote this. I met my ex on Tinder. He cheated on me when we were trying to be in an open relationship. All hell broke loose. I felt abandoned. And had a tough time. He was my only support system. I was angry, sad, lost, lonely, defeated and had no friends to talk to. 

I was hospitalized where I learnt about DPBT. Then I went to an Intensive Outpatient Program where I mainly learnt about DBT skills and how to use them in life. It changed my life to a degree. I am now trying to build my own self and not value myself based on other people. I also agree with the other people about keeping a routine. I have my morning and nighttime routines pinned in my room and I follow my checklist every day. 

I feel less lonely when I plan my self-care or really reach out to old/new friends to hang out. Ruminating was also a problem for me, I constantly delve in flashbacks. It is good to ruminate one time of the day and then let it be. Also, following this sub and watching YouTube videos made me realize I have BPD (which we didn't know when my ex left me) which my therapist and psychiatrist couldn't exactly pinpoint but now we have established that I do have BPD and bipolar depression. I am also wary of being impulsively getting attached to someone and making them seem the centre of my life. If that happens, I try to take some time off for myself. I don't always succeed in this but I know I should keep trying. 

Also, totally random, I am an atheist but I go to church because I feel welcome there and supported by people. Just going every Sunday and saying hello to the pastor who remembers me and keeps me in his prayers makes me feel less rejected. The pastor also visited me in the hospital and I cried when he did that.

My drug is food and I am still struggling on that front. This sub helps me a lot. Your story definitely resonates with me. I hope you feel better. It is a long tiring process but as my Dad says, ""As a human, it is your duty to keep trying."" Keep trying my kindred spirit. Life is life. 

Me!"
BorderlinePDisorder,f9rm2mb,t3_e6225l,1575578200.0,"I think I read the 9 major points to look out for in the DSM-5. All of those qualities are not me. I feel strong emotions when I am abandoned and that is not me, it is my disorder. I try to be more aware of my emotions and feelings and if they go back to those major points, I rationalize that it is okay how I feel and try to cope in that way. A lot of people think it is horseshit and well, they can have their opinions. In the end, your idea of yourself matters. And having an identity crisis is part of having BPD. These are just my thoughts though."
BorderlinePDisorder,f9rlc2p,t3_e61v0i,1575577920.0,"I think I have been numbed by the number of times it has happened. Also, try to not value yourself based on other people's opinions of you. 

The buzz words: self-love, self-care, keeping routine and generally keep moving. 

I also post things in great detail on reddit sometimes and venting it out helps too. 

Again, I don't know you or have great answers, I hope this was a little helpful."
BorderlinePDisorder,f9rj9g2,t1_f9quf0s,1575577110.0,"I have a similar story. I have Bipolar NOS which mostly sucks during the depression time. So, I take mood stabilizers. I told my psychiatrist about my experience with stimulants and told her it felt like 2 espresso shots and she said because I can handle them, she'll prescribe me a stimulant. I take Adderall while working during the day.

So, a combination of all of these meds and just keeping a routine is helping me from feeling that everybody thinks that I am a failure or hated universally. I just had a lot fights and toxic relationships and I am dealing with them alright. I am still able to focus for more hours than I could before.

Also, if this matters, I am a masters student and a semester behind because of an abandonment by a partner episode due to which I spiralled deep into the suicidal world. It is definitely way better now. Taking life one day at a time.

Keep it strong, mate. I think for me hiking, travelling, attending a meet up with random people and new things to learn and new people makes it all good for a while. 

“There's some good in this world, Mr. Frodo, and it's worth fighting for.” My cousin once said that to me and I still love it dearly.

SuicideWatch,f1bjhr7,t3_d8lxhb,1569336068.0,"Well, don't want to sound like a know-all. But I wanted to hurt myself and kill myself to show my ex how much I loved him and cared for him and his attention. I would always send him a note each time I attempted suicide. And if I didn't hear anything from, I wouldn't go with it. I wanted him to hurt too while I hurt. 

It didn't matter at the end. He just starting calling everything I did, my ""crazy behaviour."" It was hurtful. But he didn't come back, he doesn't want to actually talk to me and in the end, everything I did was meaningless.  I wish I could have just moved on. I wish I could just be my own person and talk and hear to myself instead of trying to prove something to him. I still need to remember that some times. He should not matter to me like I don't matter to him anymore. And my life is not worthy of him. 

Also, he couldn't even identify the country I came from on the map after we were together for a while. So, well. Goodbye. 

I don't know if this was helpful or not. I hope you get help. And it's okay to not be okay."

I was 302ed, went to an actually nice psych ward and ever since that been trying to fight it out. In either case, this is dark dark time. Hope you find some peace at the end of it."

SuicideWatch,f10om2u,t1_f0xwirz,1569115383.0,"I think he stopped loving me when I first hurt myself in front of him. The day when I cut myself deeply, he was trying to stop me and holding my hands. To make him let go, I said I will hurt him if I can't hurt myself. And he didn't really trust me after that. He only came to see me at the hospital where he felt safe. And he hasn't talked to me since June now. And I think we kind of broke up in February. There's no going back. 

I just don't know how to move away from this, the trauma of it all. And what to look out for in my future relationships. I am constantly reminded of my past and haunted by the things he said to the girl he was seeing. 

And frankly, my therapist is sick of hearing things about him. My friends are too. They just want to not think about him, cause my mental health deteriorates whenever that happens. 

Sorry for the extremely long comment. And thanks for trying to help out."
BipolarReddit,eryjrby,t3_c4uy95,1561410119.0,"I feel the same this week and would love to leave all of life and it's worries and run over to the hospital. But sooner or later, the insurance will run out and you gotta get back to life. 

And what I tell myself is that I can handle life one day at a time and there is loads of time to be had. And that things will work out. And the hospital maybe a short term solution but I can't abuse it for a vacation."
