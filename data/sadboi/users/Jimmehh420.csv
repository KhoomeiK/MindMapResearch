Lastly - do you need a hug from a white guy?  Not all white Canadian men are the same, despite what you believe.  If you want to talk through some of your thought distortions, let me know.  Just stop with the racist remarks, that will perpetuate your beliefs, but also you'll just attract racist white men and justify their beliefs at the same time.

I'm sorry you have been a victim in our country, it's obviously skewed your perception of all white men.
