BreakUps,fq7vocv,t1_fq6c7vm,1589153159.0,"Mate, there right now with you.   It is the most incredible pain I have ever felt in the whole of my life.   I try to slide myself back in the present with all the pain.  Bring the past and the future here now, no matter what is in them.  And sit perfectly still with your focus on a point in front of you.   Listen and see this point.   At any moment you feel the pangs coming close, see if you can let them in.  This focus is an added drop of an exercise of intention and may help break up the all consuming blanket of pain.  Repeat this when you feel to. x"

BreakUps,fpxf5kz,t3_gfz9dk,1588981498.0,"Heart break not only breaks your heart but it breaks everything else along with it.  Suddenly I am thrusted into a whole new world, strange, unfamiliar and frightening not just with the outer world but the inner world as well.    Getting to your car and sitting in it, is an accomplishment MotherIron, it truly is.   

When you feel this breaking down feeling coming on, rest there for a moment in your car seat, feel what your feeling, just for a moment and breath right through now this feeling.   Start the car and head to your destination.  Once you arrive, pause in your drivers seat before you get out to do the small jobs and again breath, relaxing your face expression, your shoulders throughout your body.  Hop out of your car.   Again if you feel the break down feeling here, rest and breath and relax in the midst with each step you take, deeply.  You're almost there.  Get what you need and something just for you, maybe some flower seedlings to plant.    

When you feel rushing and anxiety begin again, gently repeat your breathing and relaxing walking back to the car.   Know that you will soon arrive home to the place where you feel the most familiar, the most comfort during this time for you.   Gently moving and gently resting in this knowing.    Your home now. x"
