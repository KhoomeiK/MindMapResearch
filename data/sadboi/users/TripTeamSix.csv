I would suggest bringing her to the hospital and have Medically evaluated , if she can't walk and sleep that much, blood clots are a big concern. Her memory problems need to be checked out because they tend to not take care of themselves. 

Most elderly die at home with these symptoms. 

If you want your grandma to extend her life, I would get a ambulance out there to bring her to the hospital and get her checked out. 

Who knows , I've seen my gf's grandma in the same situation.  We almost lost her. She spend 1 month in the hospital, she was anemia, malnourished, blood infections. 

If she improves she can go-to a transitional Care facility which is a short term nursing home to help them with therapy and round the clock care. If she regains her old self back, and wants to go home she can.

Subdermal hematoma aka brain bleeds. 

This is caused by hitting your head hard enough to rip the fragile membrane kind of like a skin that's kind of keeping your brain in one spot but it's definitely not an anchor... Send the brain will smash against your skull. our brains are actually quite fragile and if the blow is hard enough, you might crush or rip a blood vessel in your brain which will then start bleeding. the cranial cavity will then start the pool with blood till it starts to create a pressure inside of the skull and causes the brain to become squeezed together and cause brain death if not quickly relieve the pressure and the bleed fixed. 


If a blow to the head is really hard enough you might notice that you have white cranial fluid coming out of your ears.

Your friend starts to bitch you out for something that didn't happen, but your anxiety takes over and while waiting for him to read and reply , you start going throufht senarios in your head of what might happen. Then he replies with a negative comment, this forcing the senarios to turn all negitve... You reply again and he takes awhile to reply to the next one, but in that time your still running senarios of how this might pan out to the point where you start believing your friend now hates you and you start to emotionally be compromised.

Then before he replys you are already trying to prevent that scenario from happening and maybe you ""tweak"" out on him to the point where when he replys he is like ""Bro what are you talking about ?? I never said that , where is this coming from?"" Then you take a second to look back at the conversation and you see that in-between messages you came up with a distorted view of the conversation in whole. 

When you re-read the conversation once noticing he wasn't even mad at you and you mentally change his tone of his texts, it's just a simple conversation that your mind derailed into something completely else. 


It's called delusions, only if you actually believe that the conversation really happened that way, but once rereading the conversation you notice you added shit along the way. 


otherwise it's completely healthy to run through scenarios in your mind because that is one way to cope with anxiety. Sometimes you need to play out scenarios in your head to see if they might be viable or not.

Ethanol was such a problem back at the turn of the last century, that the federal government started the prohibition, and to the government's eyes they did expect to have such an uproar from the entire nation. Was the uproar caused by people not being able to use what drugs they want to use? If something becomes illegal it just becomes more profitable to be sold legally such as the speak-easies & moon shiners.

I am prescribed Klonopin for panic attack only, and I only get a bottle of 2-3 at a time. Emergency use only. 

I do not have a clinical diagnosis for bipolar, but I am in the process of being reevaluated , because I suffer from a personality Disorder called Borderline Personality Disorder, where like bipolar, my mood shifts are extreme, but are caused by emotional stimui.

Honestly after like 4 days he's not going back to normal unless if you're on meth then and it took me almost two weeks till I was feeling motivated. 

Also Adderal is a dopamine reuptake inhibitor, so it raises the dopamine in your brain chemistry. Dopamine is primarily known to cause pleasure / reward in tasks. It cause does not help motivation to much. 

Motivation issues is primarily known to be a symptom of depression , which is larger correlated to serotonin imbalance. 

If you ever have taken Adderal and got nothing done, then when your off Adderall and you randomly want to clean the house , this is a simple example of the dopamine causing hyper focus, meaning your fixated on one thing, like your phone.

[TT6 Quote](https://i.imgur.com/utBD70P.jpg)

&#x200B;

The quote means that you can go UP, and crash land. Meaning using uppers will cause a crash, where as using downers have a very strong relation to death and withdrawals of downers are alot more dangerous.

Basically, you should try your hardest to stay away from ***abuse of depressants***

I've told heroin addicts with no light at the end of the tunnel to at least try to switch to a stimulant and give up the heroin completely. He went from Heroin to Meth, and then was able to get off meth x10 easier than getting off heroin , without the dangerous withdrawal. 

*Opioids cause physical dependance  when abused, meaning that when you withdrawl , you can get really sick and possibility die in some cases. Methamphetamine is a mental dependancy, will cause some bad depression and other slew of side effects, but is actually far more safe than heroin or even cocaine will ever be, as amphetamines have quite a high fatal overdose LD-50 compared to cocaine which is very cardiotoxic.*

You could also choose to reject the pain medication and try to tough it out. Also i might add that wisdom tooth extraction is usually performed under general anesthesia, which contains opioids if im not mistaken, if you have ever seen someone waking up they are high as a kite.

BPD,fpv08s9,t3_gfptby,1588930139.0,"Hmmm. You have very similar situation as me. Almost identical. 

Found out last year that I have BPD, because a doctor said I have bipolar. So I went to the Mayo Clinic(USA prestigious hospital / organization) and was confirmed to have BPD.

It didn't help me none. Knowing I have only made me think life was over after reading all the depressive posts on this subreddit. 

Honestly, I need to go back to the doctor and get my mental health sorted. I tried antidepressants last year and they made suicidal and quality of life was horrid. 

This year im not on anything and honestly I feel more like myself , which is awesome because I am able to control my emotions once again. 

I've lived 27 years with this, it's effected me in almost every area. 

Sometimes it's just better to be yourself, naturally. I would advise for therapy, I'm going to. Medications didn't help, so maybe actually talking about what's going on to someone instead of repressing it all is abetter plan. 

My advise? Stop thinking your broken. Start thinking on how to make your life better than it is. 

Beating yourself up is the easiest way to just give in and create more sadness and suffering on top.

This goes for everyone here. Just forget about BPD and worry about how to make life better than it already is. 

Also, my diagnoses of BPD was correct, I told the Psych my life story, and that was enough to convince. Let them know everything. Stories. 

The main difference between Bipolar and BPD is that BPD can cause extreme mood shifts based on emotional stimui. Meanings that my day could be going awesome, someone says the wrong thing or I get bad news and instantly my world is crushed. 

Also BPD trait is to be overly sensitive to all emotional input . You have the ability to out yourself in someone else's shoes. If someone just lost thier husband, you can actually feel thier pain, in all it's glory. I have personally used this trait to better understand people and not judge. 

I'll talk to a dude shooting up meth Infront of me, I'll talk to a dude that killed 10 people. Unless they are cunts and try and hurt me emotionally via talking or chat, I have no reason to judge another person, they might be scum, but I can't put myself in thier shoes and try to understand."

Stims,fpu9d1s,t1_fptyyjm,1588907533.0,"# Question #1: Harm on brain

Your dosages are within the FDA's therapeutic range of  5mg - 60mg/day. I am guessing you are taking Instant Release? As snorting XR would require you to crush them. Either way 42.5mg / day is a standard dose for Adderal. 

Snorting can cause a big change in tolerance, as the amphetamines are introduced at a much higher bio-availability, with less duration due to the substance not being processed by the liver and GI track. 

Your food intake and hydration is very good, better than most people. You are sleeping every night, so sleep deprivation is non-issue. 

The Neurotoxicity of the ingested amphetamines is very very low, as you are eating, sleeping and drinking water. 

The use of Benzodiazepines, such as Lorazepam (Ativan) is actually a concern, the substance itself is extremely additive that leads to dependency and can create the worst withdrawals known, worse then heroin, with the elevated risk of having withdrawal induced seizures. 

I can understand why taking a benzo would help with sleeping, but is strongly advised against.  

Your main problem sounds to be with the inability to ***want to sleep****.* This is usually caused by the flood of dopamine in the brain making everything rewarding / interesting. This can cause sleep to be last on the list compared to the grind of researching and studying. I suffer from this every time i take Adderal, and wont sleep and keep redosing the substance. 

Do not take Adderal in the afternoon, or snort it. Try taking it way earlier in the morning. Then before your bedtime(if u have one, lack of routine will cause insomnia) try taking the following to promote sleep:

 

|Melatonin up to 10mg|Natural chemical produced in your body, promotes access to circadian rhythm and tells the brain to goto sleep. This happens naturally when the sun goes down, but when on stimulants, this is ignored, resulting in insomnia.  |
|:-|:-|
|Vitamin C (1000mg Pills) or Emergen-C packets|Vitamin C (asorbic acid) is a natural anti-oxidant and is also changes the body pH to more acidic, see more about pH & amphetamines below    |
|Diphenhydramine (DPH) - (Benadryl, Unisom) 50mg Max|A common antihistamine that has a sedative effect. This will help make you feel sleepy, and aid in the process. **DPH creates a very fast tolerance, only advised to take it as last resort, do not use daily.** |
|Exercise|This honestly is the best treatment when combined with Melatonin & Vitamin C. The body will be so taxed that mind will follow suit, plus exercise will release some potent endorphins that will promote sleep.  |

&#x200B;

**Body pH:**

Amphetamines (all of them, meth included), are water soluble. This means that when the substance is introduced into the body, it will be in everything from your sweat to your tears. Amphetamines are excreted via the urinary track. When your body pH is acidic, amphetamines are excreted really quickly, as amphetamines are destroyed  by acid itself.  When the body is more alkaline, the opposite of acidic, amphetamines are held onto and will work longer. Some people take Tums 30 mins prior to dosing because the bio-availability of the substance is drastically increased, due to the stomach acid not destroying the amphetamines when it first enters your body. Adderal has a 40% loss when done orally, so making the body pH more alkaline will preserve more of the substane, and promote less waste. 

Asorbic Acid (Vitamin C) is a natural antioxidant, which will help with the neruotoxic  effects of amphetamines, also changing the body pH to more acidic which in-turn will force the excretion of the amphetamines via the urinary track. This will force all the remaining adderal in your system to be flushed out, allowing for sleep to be more accessible. 

**Drug Holiday:**

This is when you take a break from stimulants for a short while, like a weekend, or maybe a whole week. This allows the brain to reset its tolerance a bit, and will allow for the medication to work more effectively. The easiest concept behind this is ***you do not ALWAYS have to be focused, using the substance only when needed, like for work, but not at home.***

**Conclusion:**   

I do not think you will have any adverse effects as of yet to your brain, you may experience a slight withdrawal if stopped, which will be increased sleepiness and lack of interest caused by the imbalance of dopamine in your system because the Adderal was producing it for you. 

&#x200B;

Take a break, reset, and be more responsible with trying to goto sleep and when/why you take it. 

&#x200B;

I would suggest contacting your doctor that you feel like you need a larger dose, for you dont run out early. Amphetamine dosage depends on alot of factors, including how large you as a person (small people need less than bigger people)."

Stims,fptdxqq,t1_fpt8g7s,1588889487.0,"# Questions #1: Re-dosing Via Plugging ROA (boofing)

Simple answer is redosing of any substance will increase the tolerance. This is because the more substance you take in, causes more reaction by the body, in the case of Amphetamines, tolerance is based on your brains neurotransmitters, the more substance you introduce and frequency has a affect on the transmitters, they end up causing deposits on the transmitter that effectively block the effects of the substance, resulting in diminished effect

&#x200B;

>The National Institute on Drug Abuse [(NIDA) defines *tolerance*](https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/teaching-packets/neurobiology-drug-addiction/section-iii-action-heroin-morphine/6-definition-tolerance) to a drug as a biological process in which one’s body gets used to the presence of a drug and does not respond to it the same way. Over time, any drug’s effects will diminish with frequent, consistent dosing, whether this is through a prescription or because of addiction. As the original effects fade, the person may be tempted to take more of the substance to achieve the prior sensations. This is especially risky among those who misuse or abuse potent drugs [^(source)](https://www.oxfordtreatment.com/prescription-drug-abuse/adderall/tolerance/)  
>  
>Generally, higher doses of medications and longer durations of use put patients at increased risk of developing dependence and tolerance. However, during periods of abstinence from the medication, these phenomena are reversible. Most psychopharmacological agents have the potential to cause at least some tolerance, dependence, and addiction, even medications considered safe for long-term use, such as antidepressants. [^(source)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3036556/)  
>  
>While most substances that lead to addiction increase DA release by indirect pathways, stimulants act directly on presynaptic DA receptors themselves, leading to release of DA in storage vesicles. The two types of prescribed stimulants, methylphenidate and amphetamine, have slightly different mechanisms of action. Methylphenidate inhibits the reuptake of dopamine. Amphetamine has the additional function of entering the presynaptic neuron and forcing additional vesicular DA into the synapse. Stimulants are thought to have their therapeutic effects mostly through D1, but they have been shown to also have significant action at D2. [^(source)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3036556/)  
>  
>In theory, by manipulating DA directly, stimulants should be especially conducive to activating DA regulatory mechanisms (e.g., reduction of presynaptic release and postsynaptic receptor downregulation). DA receptor changes have been found to correlate both with observed and reported signs of tolerance to both DA agonists (e.g., stimulants) and antagonists (e.g., antipsychotics) as a result changes in D2 receptor density. For example, “supersensitive” DA receptors have been demonstrated with chronic antipsychotic use and correlate with observed medication tolerance. One study showed that repeating the same dose of stimulant, immediately after therapeutic effects were lost, produced only half the efficacy of the initial dose. This suggests that tolerance to stimulants occurs at some degree even within several hours. [^(source)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3036556/)

&#x200B;

# Question #2: Risks involved with Plugging stimulants

The main risk you run is vasoconstriction of the vessels in the bowel, long duration's of vasoconstriction of the bowel can bring a host of problems. Switching up your ROA's is a better option then continuing boofing, especially redosing. 

Overdosing has a higher rate due to bio-availability of rectal administration, 95%  

Staying hydrated is key, also taking supplements to help with vaso-constriction is also noted to be helpful. 

>Complications of intestinal absorption to MA have been reported primarily in the context of both body packers and stuffers. Body packers, often referred to as “mules,” swallow packets (such as condoms) containing large quantities of drugs as a transport method with the expectation of subsequently defecating the packets intact. Body stuffers, on the other hand, swallow drugs to avoid capture while in possession of drugs. The former group experiences toxicity when transport vehicles fail and inadvertently release drugs into the gastrointestinal tract. The latter group absorbs drugs as a result of haphazard packaging and rapid consumption of the drug. The occurrence of ischemic bowel after systemically administered cocaine or ergotamine use, secondary to mesenteric vasoconstriction, is well documented. There have also been at least four case reports of ischemic bowel after MA use. The application of methamphetamine directly to rectal mucosa likely has local vasoconstrictive effects, making rectal ischemia and necrosis a potential complication.

Go-to Walmart. 


Grab: BROWN NON-BLEACHED COFFEE FILTERS. 

Go-to the paint isle, and find the metal solvent cans in the area. 

Grab a can of acetone. 

Find the mason jars with lid/seal. I've been able to find single jars for sale, otherwise try to keep the depth a litter deeper. 


Crush your meth, like crush crush, after crushing it, crush it more. 


Take the coffee filter and rig it up so that its 1/3 of the way inside the jar, then lightly attach the lid, no seal needed. 


Open your acetone can and pour slowly over your meth, meth isn't soluble in acetone, but general cuts like MSM are. 

MSM is know to be underwhelming, because it actually isnt bad for the body , fights the meth, know to come in and out . 


Let the acetone completely drip front he coffee filter, repeat for better de-cutting. 


Remember to always close and open your can of acetone immediately. Water vapor is sucked into the can, meth is water soluible so the more air and moisture gets in the can, the less effective. 


*The best acetone is called anhydrous acetone, found at hardware stores, it's been dried of water*. 

I've only ever used the Walmart can, so I trust it to do the job. 


Remember to let the meth COMPLETELY DRY OUT. this takes time, and you want to make sure.to break it up when the clumps of powder start sticking. Easy way to do this  is rub the coffee filter against it self. 

A quick smell of the coffee filter whole breaking it apart, = no hint of acetone vapors = all dry

Any hint of acetone, re-rub it and let it dry some more. 

(This is all to prevent acetone being trapped inside micro-crumps, especially nasty and. Dangerous if injected, I've injected meth I've washed and dried imporoperly, and ended up with a epic nasty chemical taste in my mouth and purple face for a second. )
