depression,eyralsr,t3_cp1ajy,1567363953.0,"I do ... I never fit in even tho it seems like ppl like me but it's mostly to the way I work and the stuff I do for ppl. So I dont have any friends (only co workers and acquaintances). As far as family I tried to talk to them and explain how I feel but was told ""I'll get over it"". I spend most of my off time alone doing stuff to keep my mind of the fact that I'll probably be this way for the rest of my life. I dont talk alot and I stay to myself. So the obvious is that I haven't had a personal relationship in years. I can tell no one wants to deal with a mental case like my self. And I have came to terms with that. Well thank you all for at least letting me get this off my chest."
