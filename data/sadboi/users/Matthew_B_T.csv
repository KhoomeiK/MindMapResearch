mentalillness,fqxqwvy,t1_fqu92st,1589736485.0,"Thank you for sharing all that. Your life hasn't been the easiest to far. Kudos for finding the strength to fight for yourself.

I have a question about your diagnosis. Please don't take this as an attempt to challenge it or anything like that. It's out of pure curiosity. It seems to me that you had many good reasons to be depressed. Having to deal with disabilities in your family and the suffering associated to them can definitely have an impact on your mental health. And if you couple that with a lack of support from other members of your family (your grandma) and from your toxic friends, you have a nice recipe for depression. Plus, as soon as you moved out you started recovering. So my question is, did your mental health issues start before all these personal problems started? Again, not trying to explain away your illness. 

One last comment on the graduation situation. I understand that family matters are complicated and picking a side usually means disregarding the other side's argument. But I feel you might use some words of encouragement regarding the possibility of not going to your brother's graduation. I really think it would be best for you if you made the decision without considering how your family would take it. I feel the stability you have reached in your current environment is worth more than making your family happy. As hard as it might be. Because for you, the cost of losing that stability could be unbearable. It's not about making a sacrifice. It's about putting your wellbeing before other people's happiness. Of course, I understand it's not an easy decision. But I thought you could use some positive feedback.

Oh and I really hope you have a successful career! Please let us know where we can see any of your work once you start your professional life. Best of luck!"
mentalillness,fqu7l6t,t3_gkrdv0,1589653570.0,"Hey please tell us more about what happened. It would be useful to have more detail about the context. 

The feelings of rejection and loss in a relationship setting are excruciatingly painful. Sometimes it feels like the pain can drive you mad. But before we draw any conclusions, are you sure all hope is lost with this person?

Regardless, please keep in mind that the feeling of despair you are feeling right now doesn't last forever. You are at the peak, but in a short period of time you will feel a bit better. Once you gain back some clarity we can try to figure out how to avoid this kind of situation in the future and how to get you a partner. Btw 24 is kinda late, but definitely not unheard of.

Please don't make any drastic decisions and if you feel like you are being overwhelmed talk to your parents/friends or don't hesitate do dm me."
mentalillness,fqu5p83,t3_gkx87t,1589652526.0,"Nice to read about someone who is winning a battle every once in a while!

And you kinda ""sound"" different.. like your post has a positive vibe to it. 

It's great your cousin offered you a place to stay. It's really nice of them. But you should also be proud of yourself for making this difficult decision. Keep fighting for yourself! 

As for the Canada plan, yes 3 years is a long time. So I guess you need to find a medium term strategy to handle the situation. How long can you stay at your cousin's? Anyways, I hope being away from your family for a while is gonna help you heal a bit and get more clear headed. Challenges will not look so daunting if you get out of that dark pit you fell in.

I wish you the best. Stay strong and keep fighting! You deserve to get yourself a better life. And please keep us updated on how things evolve!"
mentalillness,fqb11om,t1_fq6i411,1589228712.0,"Hey that's wonderful news! You already have a way out of there! How long do you think it's gonna be before you can move in? Doesn't the thought of leaving all that suffering behind help you at all? How do you feel when you think about moving in with your fianc√©?

No your aunt is not an option, understood. But your friends seem to really care about you. I would consider taking them up on their offer, if only for a few days. If you feel like you're about to break down, just call one of them and ask if you can crash at their place for a couple of days. Yes, of course you will be a burden. But that's what makes them friends. They would be glad to shoulder that burden to spend time with you and make you happy. And you don't seem the kind of person that abuses of other people's generosity.

I think accepting your friends' offer would be very important for you, not only because it would allow you to get away from your family for a while. It's important to be able to fight for yourself in these situations. And putting your interest before your friends' convenience is one way of fighting for your own wellbeing."
mentalillness,fq6fn1p,t1_fq5nt01,1589130595.0,"Ok so you have good friends, you graduated college in spite of your mental issues, and you had a job. That sounds promising. It doesn't mean you should feel any better at the moment, but those are all important elements that could help you get out of that awful situation in the future.

I'm really sorry to read about the way you were abused. It is evident that you can't just simply forgive your parents for the way they treated you. At some point you will have to cope with it, and possibly come to terms with the fact that you might never receive any apologies for their actions. In the meantime, given that you are forced to live with your parents for a while, I suggest you try to cut back on the hostility right now. It's more than warranted, I get it, but the continuous fights are taking a toll on you. And on you only. 

From what I understand you'd be welcome to stay at your aunt's if it wasn't for the quarantine. That sounds like a great prospect to me no? The lockdown won't last much longer, so why don't you start planning to move to her place? What's stopping you?

Also, are you still in that relationship you mentioned? Does he/she know about your issues? And what about your best friends? Why didn't you ask them for help before attempting?"
mentalillness,fq5q4ov,t3_gglhvt,1589114297.0,"I really feel your struggle and I admire you for making it so far in spite of all the adversities. It's really something to be proud of. 

You find yourself in a really complex situation and even though you provided a lot of details, providing a solution to your problems is beyond my ability. You did make a step in the right direction by sharing this with the community. You seem to be in a really dark place and talking about your issues can be extremely beneficial to start on your journey of recovery. 

I do believe recovery is possible. Admittedly I'm not a fan of generic uplifting comments, but you have proved beyond the shadow of a doubt that you are a capable person, that you can take care of yourself, and that there is potential within you to achieve meaningful goals in your life. When the whole world doesn't turn against you that is. So the most pressing issue at the moment is getting through this awful depression phase, so you can start to rebuild your life and get back on your feet. 

Easier said than done, I know. But reading the last part of your post it seems evident to me that you've started blaming yourself for all the problems you have. Self loathing is almost never useful in cases like this. What messed up your life was that episode of depression that occurred at the least appropriate moment. You didn't ask for it. It happened to you. Unfortunately, depression and anxiety compound, because if they make you not functional, they bring along a whole host of problems, which add to your mental burden. 

My last point might sound pessimistic but I believe that being realistic can help cope with your emotions. You seemed to be on an upward trajectory. Everything seemed to have worked out and you were headed for a bright future. Then depression struck. And that bright future seems out of reach now. The sad truth is that it might really be unattainable. And I know how heart breaking that is, trust me. I'm not saying you're doomed to a life of failure and unhappiness. I'm saying that you might have to redefine what success and happiness will look like for you. Adjusting your expectations is the only way to lower your feeling of anxiety and depression over the lost opportunities. I hear you, it's hard and excruciatingly painful. But the truth might well be that you never had those opportunities. Because unlike most other people, you were saddled with the burden of mental illnesses that can storm in your life unannounced and fuck it up. Please don't read this as ""stop dreaming"" or ""you're hopeless"". My message is: it's normal to be sad about the lost opportunities but stop torturing yourself over them as there was nothing you could have done about it. Looking forward, set your goals considering that you face a harder battle than most other people, and therefore you should be proud of any small achievement.

There is a lot still to address about your situation, and I would like to hear more details about some of your issues. If you feel like talking to a stranger don't hesitate to dm me. I have some experience when it comes to job hunting. We could go over your financial issues as well. Just outlining the problem to someone outside your head could help make the issue look less scary.

Best of luck with your battle."
mentalillness,fq5jvy1,t3_ggsqjb,1589108205.0,"Sorry to hear about your mental health issues. And congratulations for fighting them and getting out there on Twitch.

Not sure what caused your reaction though.... After you opened up on twitch you literally lost less than 0.01% of followers. Sure you lost 6% of subscribed but then it's a matter of glass half full or half empty. I think it's great you had the courage to open up, and I see the reaction of your followers base as a positive sign of acceptance. Maybe I'm missing something though...

Best of luck"
mentalillness,fq5jbos,t3_ggwplt,1589107604.0,"It always saddens me to hear about people like you going through really tough situations without having the support they need. Do you feel like sharing with us more details about your struggle? What is preventing you from getting access to a therapist? Is it a financial issue?

Please keep in mind that if you feel like you need to have to talk to a therapist then your problems are real and relevant. You don't need to have an official diagnosis for your suffering to be validated. Of course, I'm not saying you don't need a diagnosis. That's key to your recovery process. But don't give in to the feeling that your issues are not legitimate. 

I hope you have good friends you can talk to but in case you felt the need to talk to a stranger, don't hesitate to dm me. Best of luck with everything."
mentalillness,fq5hnie,t3_ggxl3z,1589105777.0,"Hey you made the right decision deciding to share your story with us. You are indeed in a very dark place right now. I can't even imagine what it feels like to struggle with your depression without the support of your family. But that doesn't mean you're alone in this. What's your situation outside the family? Do you have a couple of good friends you can rely on? What about your therapist? Why do you feel the need to change it? Also, if your parents are willing to pay for it what difference does it make to them if you change therapist? Also, what is your employment situation? I guess you are still a student right?

I think the most pressing issue right now is trying to make sure you have some sort of safety net when you feel completely overwhelmed. I think anything would be better than being caught by your sister while attempting. Again, friends could be a great safety net, but also your therapist if he's up for it, and your other relatives like your aunt and cousins. From what I understand they really seem to care about you. And of course don't hesitate to dm me if you feel like it.

I believe your relationship with your parents could be improved. Which doesn't mean you should forgive them for what they did. But it seems that right now there is no form of communication whatsoever between you and the rest of your family. I know it's easier said than done, but I do believe that reopening a dialogue with them and setting a couple of things straight, could make your life less miserable. I want to make clear I'm not saying you should go ahead ad fix things rn. If you can more power to you, but I understand it's not that easy. But I'm suggesting that there might be hope to de escalate the situation. Your therapist can help you work on that for sure(if they are a decent therapist).

As for what concerns your abuse, would you care to share more with us? No need to go into much detail, but it could help us better understand the reason behind your conflict with your family. 

You're not alone, there are many people out there that have had similar experiences and could understand you. And then there are people that are just willing to give you some support. Again, if you were ever to find yourself again in a situation of total despair, please reach out to anyone, it doesn't matter who. I'm sure in this community you will find friendly voices willing to help get back on your feet.

Best of luck with your struggle."
mentalillness,fpzqkom,t3_gg1qhl,1589022067.0,"Hey I've been through a similar situation myself, although it lasted for a short period of time. The peak at least. Of course, what you're going through is unique to yourself, and I don't claim to have the solution at all.

But there are a couple of things that caught my eye in your post and in the convo below. First of all, I think the goals that u/365dailylooks mentioned are of a different kind from the ones you described. Because in the example you brought up, the reward was totally decoupled from the effort. I think the idea is to have a long term goal, something that is deeply meaningful to you and that you will have to fight for. Just to be clear it could be a career goal, self-employment goal or stuff like this. Doesn't have to be set in stone! You can change your mind as you progress, but it has to be something you find digging deep within yourself. It has to be genuine. 

The other thing I noticed is your relationship with your problems and with your family. I'm under the impression that you have not come to terms with the fact that this is something that **happened** to you. I think you understand this is a major problem. But I don't think you (and your family) understand that this is beyond being lazy. You're not coming up with a bunch of excuses. You're basically saying that you are disgusted by your own behavior. What you've got is nothing short of an illness, and you didn't ask for it. This doesn't mean that now you can sit on our ass and complain about your problems for the rest of your life. You will still have to fight at some point. But I feel you should shift your role from perpetrator to victim. If you allow me to make a parallel with a physical illness, one thing is having cancer. Feeling like an asshole about it is a totally different thing. 

Your parents definitely don't seem to understand your situation. Taking away your Xbox was not an irrational decision (you should have a ps4 in the first place), but it seems to miss the point completely. It seems you and your family are engaged in an internal fight, while instead, you should join forces to fight against your illness. I'm not pointing the finger against you or your family. This is a complicated situation and given the limited amount of information you provided, it would be stupid to assign blame. Plus this is not what you need right now. Having the support of your family is really important, if not fundamental in these situations. Again, I have no idea what kind of discussions you've had about your issues with your family, but I strongly suggest you try to open up a dialog with them and make them understand you need them as allies rn. 

I think lying to your therapist is the perfect example of how the way you and your family are approaching your issues leads you to make counterproductive choices. I feel that decision was the result of feeling antagonized and guilty about your condition. If you accepted the fact that you are not responsible for falling into that dark pit you find yourself in, and if your family realizes that throwing rocks at you from above is not the best solution, I'm confident you will get back on the right path to solve your issues. 

I want to stress that I made a lot of assumptions while writing this so it is likely I got many of the details wrong. Please consider that I was genuinely trying to help and, by no means I intended to disrespect you and your family. Best of luck with your struggle. You're definitely not alone."
mentalillness,fpzhjvj,t3_ggbrgi,1589018342.0,"Your writing style is powerful. The post does a really good job of conveying your emotions, and in some parts really evoked the feeling of being in that kind of mental state.

It would be very interesting to know a little bit more about why you feel all that anxiety and despair, to have more detail about your kind of thoughts. And about your story in general, if you feel like it.

It's obvious that you've been in a really dark place for a long time now, considering that the thought of suicide calms you down and provides some relief from the agony. I really hope you have a safety net, someone to talk to in case you really felt overwhelmed and on the brink of making a drastic decision. Whether it be family, friends, or your therapist. In any case, as I said it would be nice if you shared more with us. You never know where help can come from.

Best of luck with your struggle."
mentalillness,fppcie2,t1_fpna7q0,1588799794.0,"It's kinda heart breaking to read that nothing has changed and that you're carrying even more weight right now. She's in hell, and I hope one day she will snap out of it long enough to make her decide to do something about it. But you, my friend, are paying for all her ""sins"". Honestly reading this post I don't see any change in patterns, any slight improvement that could justify me saying ""hang in there and don't abandon her"". 

At this point I don't think there is any value in trying to support you in your (honorable) attempts to make this relationship work. So I think I'll shift my focus on you. Because as I said, I'm more interested in your wellbeing than in her rn. Without beating around the bush, I don't think you're in a position where you can help her. I think you can provide her some temporary relief by allowing her to vent with complete disregard for your feelings. But from what I understand that's pretty much what she does with anybody. The difference being that you really love her. I suspect she left you on read because she knows that she can hurt you that way. This is just an anecdote, but I think it might well represent your position in this relationship at the moment. 

The question that keeps popping out in my mind when I read your posts is: **Would you be able to detach from her if you wanted to? This is the key question for me. Do you have other good friends you could hang out with on a regular basis?**

If the answer to that question is yes, then I suggest you really start detaching from her. I understand you when you say that you don't want to abandon her. One way of detaching without abandoning her could be the following:

\- Set some conditions, for example, that she take your feeling into account more often (this is very vague, I'm sure you can come up with more concrete requests).

\- Tell her you won't hang out with her until she agrees to make an effort to meet your conditions.

\- Actually keep your promise.

\- If and when she shows some willingness to make an effort to make your life easier, immediately restart hanging out with her. It's important you don't punish her for doing the right thing. 

I know this would be very hard for you, but I really can't force myself to tell you to suck it up and go on, and everything will be ok. It doesn't seem to be the case. I think pretty much everyone you asked told you the same thing.

Regardless of your decision, if you need to talk don't hesitate to dm me or write a post here. And thank you for posting this update. I hope my comment won't strike you as being insensitive. Although I cannot fully understand what you're going through, I know you're in a complex and painful situation. I just don't see how lying to you could be of any help. Best of luck"
mentalillness,fphkc3c,t1_fpez4t5,1588622793.0,"I think it's more common to blame your ex for all your troubles than your best friend. But I'm getting the idea that Lia might not be the kind of person you want to have around at this point in time. I'm not trying to say she's evil, she's obviously struggling with her own mental issues. But the way she copes with them seems to be totally toxic rn. 

So from what I understand from your reply, you managed to keep some friends from the group you used to hang out with, right? If that's the case, you might want to leverage these friendships to see if you can distract yourself a bit. Only interacting with your bf might not be optimal. (I'm guessing here so I apologize if my assumptions are incorrect). The fact that you still have some friends from that company could help you convince yourself that whatever you did wrong (if anything at all) was not so outrageous as Lia made it out to be.

This brings me to the next fundamental question. You seem to have a lot of issues that go way back before Lia. But if we were to focus on this latest problem specifically, what is it that upsets you? What is it that terrifies you whenever Lia comes up in a conversation? I mean I understand that being treated like that by your best friend is traumatic, that's clear. But what prevents you from ""getting over it""? I know you wrote you can't do it and this is a recurring theme in your life. But can you at least identify one reason why you can't convince yourself that there was nothing you could have done to save that friendship? Or one reason why you are afraid?

Would you want to go back to hanging out with her if you had a chance to? Not saying you should, just asking.

 It seems that the initial hostility towards you was not triggered by anything specific you did. Do you have any idea why things went south between the two of you the first time? The fact that your friends told you to ignore her kinda makes me feel that they knew she was unstable at the time. 

Last question. Did you have a chance to clarify why you told her not to self harm in front of you? Have you had a discussion about it? Because even though it seems like Lia was looking for an excuse to start this conflict, this whole situation seems to revolve around a misunderstanding. I'm not saying that you should apologize. But considering that both of you had a very emotional response to that episode in the classroom, it might be worth considering whether saying ""I'm sorry for the way I reacted. What you did was very disturbing to me. And for this reason I reacted without considering your emotions"" could help put an end to this conflict.

Again, I'm just trying to get a sense of what you've been through. So please don't feel offended if some of my questions or remarks are totally off."
depression,fpdj4au,t3_gcuhin,1588527999.0,"This looks more like a cry for help than a rant. You find yourself in a very dark place right now and the only lights that are left seem to be getting dimmer and dimmer. It really saddens me to read that you're not taken seriously. At this point, I'm not sure what needs to happen to a man for them to be taken seriously. I can partially understand your parents, but the doctors? I mean, you've been prescribed antidepressants for a reason I guess. Why wouldn't they take you seriously?

I think it's amazing that your wife is supporting you(to the best that she can at least) and I believe her support is something worth fighting for. I'm not sure guilt is something worth spending your energy on instead. Easier said than done, I understand that. But no amount of guilt will fix your past mistakes. And you didn't ask for your mental issues. This doesn't mean that all your actions are justified, but for anyone to judge you for how you coped with your specific illness, they would have to experience it themselves. When you get better, and I really hope you do, you can work on making up for past mistakes. Best of luck"
mentalillness,fpdey2f,t3_gcrir8,1588525663.0,"I think some people are indeed fascinated with the idea of mental health. Movie characters with mental health issues always seem to be more interesting because their illnesses appear to add an extra dimension to their personality. And some people are also attracted(at least superficially) to those who suffer from mental illnesses because they are outside of the ordinary. Until shit hits the fan that is. Because as you say they just romanticize it. They get to see the ""out of the ordinary"" part without having to deal with everything else that comes with it.

It's fundamental to be able to share your feelings with someone, but I personally believe you should pick that someone carefully. Not everyone is able to empathize with you."

How is the interaction with mentally ill people affecting you? You say you're not contributing anything to this world and that there is nothing that you like about life, but this post seems to show that's not entirely true.

Sometimes we put on masks to fit in contexts that simply don't belong to us, and this will inevitably create conflicts within us. But other times we do it because we realize that we need to force ourselves outside our comfort zone. So if you're using a mask to push your limits and be a better version of yourself then why not.

mentalillness,fpclt1k,t3_gchfrm,1588505331.0,"Damn you've been through a LOT. There are some bright spots in your post, even though they are few and far between. What really struck me was the fact that your mother doesn't support you. Don't get me wrong, pretty much everything else you write about is awful and I wish you were not experiencing it. But that somehow feels like too much. I'm so glad to see that you are in a good relationship with your bf. 

The other positive thing that I see is that you did manage to make friends in your new school. They might not have been as close to you as Lia was, but that means that you were able to integrate successfully with your new classmates. That is extremely positive! From what I understand, Lia was able to fuck that up too, but are you sure that it's all broken beyond repair? I think that people can see you're a genuine person and that you're just hurt for what happened to your friendship. I think it might be worth patching things up with your other friends. I know it's not easy, but it seems like it might be an effort worth making considering how much you are suffering. And having some social interaction with people other than your bf could help with the feeling of being trapped (lockdown not withstanding). 

From the way you describe her behavior, I have the feeling that Lia's issues went well beyond the ED. Not a diagnosis by any means, but it vaguely sounds like BPD. And if there is any truth to what she was accusing you of, then it might be worth spending some time analyzing your behavior to see if there is anything that you could do to improve the way you relate to people. Unless you completely omitted some fundamental part of your story where you stab Lia in the back or anything like that, I still don't think you're to blame for her mental issues. But reflecting on your actions could always be a good way to confirm that indeed you were only a good friend to her. Maybe you could ask your other friends to give you their take on what went wrong. 

Your story is complicated, and at this point, I would normally start asking questions to get a better feeling for what actually happened and how it might have affected you. Your recent diagnosis of depression and anxiety might well be a consequence of your troubles within your social context, or they might have something to do with the potential Asperger diagnosis. Not the easiest scenario to evaluate. I'm sorry to read that the therapist didn't work out. **Please don't give up and try a new one.** It's absolutely normal to try out a couple before finding the right one for you. 

I wish you the best. And if you feel like you want to talk to someone and share more about your story, don't hesitate to dm me. Good luck"
mentalillness,fpcjnx3,t3_gcmeah,1588503046.0,"Although I feel your struggle and I fully respect the severity of your issues, for me, the main take away from your post is hope. From what I understand, ever since you were a kid you had serious issues with self confidence and your own image. Through hard work, both mental and physical, you made huge strides toward overcoming these issues. 2 years ago you were at the peak of your recovery. The results of your efforts could not only be measured by a boost in self-confidence but also through external feedback, as you started a relationship around that time. 

Now here is where the shit hits the fan. You experienced rejection. That can be emotionally devastating for anyone. But for someone who has had serious problems with self confidence, it can spell the end of all the efforts to improve and of all the positive thinking. It can be that big of a deal. I just want to make it clear because sometimes people can feel silly about it, but that kind of shocks can be extremely traumatic. So honestly, I'm not surprised to see that that episode wasn't simply a minor setback in your self-improvement journey. I'm actually positively surprised to see that somehow you didn't give up and you kept up the great work, even though you're efforts are now plagued with doubt. 

Let me stress that this is totally normal for someone in your situation. Now here comes the hope part. Your efforts showed tangible results! That girl started dating you because of your efforts. That means that you were able to improve your status within society, you were headed in the right direction. That's something not everyone can say. (I don't know how low your self-esteem was, so forgive me if I'm assuming your situation was worse than what it actually was in reality). Again, it's normal to feel doubt about the validity of your work, given that your brain will inevitably interpret rejection as an utter failure on all fronts. But that is only part of the story. The fact that you were able to experience rejection after dating that girl is proof of success in and of itself.

I believe that the key to getting back on track here is to accurately analyze and internalize that rejection. The fact that you undeniably improved yourself, and that you are now a significantly better version of yourself, doesn't mean you're done. Your physical aspect might not be the only part of yourself that needs improving. It sucks, but you definitely seem to have the strength to start working on that too. Why did she stand you up? Did you do anything to influence her decision? Or was she simply not looking for anything serious? Have you discussed this with her?

Maybe the way to start loving yourself again is to look back and acknowledge that all your hard work brought amazing results, but also to accept that you're not done. Sometimes when we start seeing the results of our efforts we get ahead of ourselves and we are caught off guard when the inevitable setback materializes. Keep up the great work, you're on the right path."
mentalillness,fpcgv00,t3_gcitr9,1588500152.0,"Hi, sorry if I'm missing some background info here. I guess you're experimenting with writing as a way of externalizing what you're going through.

mentalillness,fpa2dfn,t3_gc6mrm,1588439411.0,"That's quite a  complicated situation. You did mention in the beginning that your problems go way back, but from what I understand your most impending issue is the way these problems have evolved over time. It seems like you've been fighting for so long that somehow your mental health issues have become the ""norm"", both for you and apparently for your mother. I get the impression that, since you've been at it for a very long time, your subconscious doesn't consider getting worse as being worth mentioning to family and friends, unless it's ""serious enough"". This is, of course, a very dangerous situation, and by reading your post I get the feeling that you are fully aware of that. I agree with u/Winnie639, you should definitely ask for help ASAP. Anyone could see that your situation is well beyond the threshold of ""serious enough"", just by reading your post.

You touch on a lot of interesting points in your post and I would like to comment on a couple of them. Reading from the 4th paragraph on, it seems to me that currently, you don't have a good relationship with your mother. Judging by what you write, it seems that either she doesn't take your problems seriously enough (the razors, the pills, the professional help), or she doesn't understand the severity of your issues. I strongly suggest you make an effort to fix this. It's really important to have as much support from your family as possible. And it's obvious that this conflict with your mother is taking a huge toll on you. As if you didn't have enough problems to sort out. 

\- If she doesn't take your problems seriously enough, there is no need to do something stupid to help her change her mind. If talking doesn't work, you can always make a scene to scare her. No need to s/h, just make enough noise to make her understand this is not business as usual. You're drowning, slowly but surely, and you need her NOW.

\- If instead, she's not fully aware of how deep your issues are, then maybe you can question whether you communicate effectively with her. Do you downplay your own problems when you talk to her? It's unbelievably hard for someone who's never struggled with mental issues to empathize with someone with mental issues. For you, it's obvious that you're going through a lot of pain. But maybe for an external observer, this is not so obvious. 

As to the professional help for the ED, I'm sure you can find professionals who are willing to do online therapy. It shouldn't be an issue by any means. So, please don't drag out your pain unnecessarily and tell your mother to help you find a therapist now. 

In the last part of your post, you write "" I just wanna die because I can't stand living with all this pain, not being able to get help and feeling utterly hopeless. "".Let me just say that that's unbelievably sad and it's a clear proof of how serious your problems are. Please, before concluding that you cannot get help, do whatever it takes to make the people around you understand how much pain you're going through. Try to fix your relationship with your mother so you can have someone to rely on in your family. And if that doesn't work tell a friend you need help. Or other members of your family. And don't downplay your own problems. They are real and serious. Please don't give up until you are sure that you did all you could to make people know.

Best of luck. And if you need to talk to someone don't hesitate to dm me."

I know it might be hard to swallow, but this might be it. This might be the rock bottom. This might be the time where you look death in the eyes and get the motivation you need to change. Because it is obvious that as it is, the situation is not sustainable. I want to be clear, I'm not saying you've purposefully sabotaged yourself. What I'm saying is that you have probably been a victim of your insecurities and mental issues. Take this as an opportunity to start a new life. Challange all your suppositions as to what your life should look like. Are you sure you *want* to go to college? Can you make a huge effort and make at least one new friend?

I really hope you don't miss this opportunity to turn your life around. You don't get too often to stare death in the face and walk away. **And please talk to your parents about your issues!**

depression,fozqcg2,t3_gahdtg,1588195020.0,"I totally understand what you mean. But maybe you should... nah jk.

I personally believe it's impossible for people who never experienced depression to relate to people with depression. Because when you have depression it's like going into a parallel universe where the normal rules don't apply. A universe where all the ""shoulds"" and the ""because"" stop making sense. 

This being said it's normal for people who love you to try to help you. They just feel an urge to try and do something. It's like looking at someone who is drowning without doing anything. I think it would help if you made it clear to them that some things they say only make you sink deeper into the water. You don't need to perfectly explain yourself. You just can't. There are some things they will simply have to accept.

Of course, I suppose that you are already trying to improve your situation through therapy or whatever. If not, it's easier to justify some of your friend's attempts to help.

Best of luck with your struggle."

I do see an opportunity to improve the situation in general though. Of course, I don't know anything about your parents and your relationship with them. But I can assure you that it is extremely important to at least try to have a good relationship with them. I know it's easier said than done. But I'm convinced it would significantly improve your life. I'm not suggesting you go back to them crawling. They definitely have their fair share of blame to take.

mentalillness,fozih90,t3_ga9iqu,1588191214.0,"Hi, first of all I'm sorry to read you're suffering from depression.   
As for your specific issue, I experience it quite often even if I'm not depressed. I'm extremely high in neuroticism (as in personality trait) and sometimes even small hiccups can make me suddenly angry. This happens especially if I'm stressed or I'm having a rough day. If instead I'm having a particularly enjoyable day, those same unpleasant experiences will have way less of an impact on my mood. 

No idea what causes depression at a biological level, but you can imagine it as if someone dialed your neuroticism score all the way to 11. Every input you receive will be more likely to be processed as a potential threat, and moreover all the stimuli that would normally cause discomfort will be interpreted as unpleasant. Cold water on the skin is not objectively pleasant. Its final effect on your mood depends on how your brain processes that stimulus. As you say, when you're happy it feels good because it is like a ""cure to wake you up"". When you're depressed your brain is like ""who the fuck said I need to wake up?"".

This is my interpretation based on my personal experiences and through the lenses of personality theory. I hope at least I gave you some food for thought. Good luck with your struggle."

This being said, if you don't like your body as it is, and you feel you could improve it by doing some exercise, then go ahead and burn those calories. It can only do you good. And no if you're heavy set due to your bone structure and basically your genes, then you won't become as skinny as a model. But men can tell if you're taking care of your body. And that would also increase your self esteem, which in turn would help with motivation.

Although this kind of event can be devastating for everyone, you have the additional problem that you will have to bear an emotional burden for way longer than the average person. I hope you understand I wasn't trying to oversimplify your issues.

This being said, I still stand by my initial point. Please don't make any decisions now! Especially such a drastic decision as taking your life. Give yourself time to adjust to the new situation. Maybe in a month, you will feel better, even if marginally so. And give life the benefit of the doubt. So far it's not been kind to you in general, but it gave you the possibility to know love. I don't see any reason why that can't happen again. And maybe next time it will be the real one.

I'd be glad to provide some support, to the best of my ability."
mentalillness,fonf0ih,t1_fomudx4,1587918229.0,"Thank you for sharing more. It can be difficult to share your relationship issues, especially if there is a sense of guilt associated to them.

When I said that time always works I was referring to the pain you are feeling right now. A sudden breakup can tear you apart emotionally and cause an unbearable amount of pain. But only in the short run. Of course, when this initial shock is over you will still be left with your long standing issues. Some of the things you wrote in your initial post had me worried that you were being overwhelmed by the situation. That's why I suggested you focus on getting through this awful initial phase. You cannot think clearly while suffering so much.

Given how you describe your last relationship it seems like you had issues that are quite common to most couples. In a relationship, having disagreements and fighting over them is just natural. So when you say "" I think I shouldn't get upset with my boyfriend or argue with him because that's what screws everything up "" I'm not sure if that would be healthy at all. Ideally, fights should be used to settle disagreements. If you find yourself fighting over the same issue over and over again without making any progress, that could put a strain on a relationship.

You say you don't know exactly what caused your previous relationship to fall apart. This, in my opinion, is the first step toward solving your relationship problems. I think it is vital you determine whether there is a recurring pattern of mistakes or behaviors so you can start working on those specific issues. 

You seem to suggest that your mental illness is hard to cope with, not only for you but also for the people you love. And that might be what drives them away. First of all, please don't think that the fact you have a mental illness automatically makes you a bad girlfriend or that it makes you unlovable. Sure, there is no denying that many people are not equipped to deal with mental issues. Ideally you should avoid dating those people. But I can assure you there are also people out there who have the ability and will to be by your side during your darkest moments. That doesn't relieve you from all the responsibility though. You should do your best to manage your illness and to expose your partner to the manifestation of its symptoms as little as possible. You can't dump all your emotional burden on them unfortunately.

As a recap:

\- What matters now is that you get through this initial phase of grief, which won't last too long.

\- When you can start thinking clearly again, I suggest you work hard to narrow down the possible causes for the end of all your past relationships. It's vital you know what you have to focus on if you want to solve your long lasting problems.

\- There are people out there that can handle having a partner with a mental illness. Your responsibility is to do your best to make your mental illness as little a burden as possible for your future partner, without feeling guilty about asking for his help when you need him."
mentalillness,fomqi00,t3_g8ahwt,1587900191.0,"Damn this post was hard to read. It almost made me feel your pain. When you wrote it you must have been in a very dark place. The whole post is a downward spiral of self loathing. I hope you calmed down and you took a moment to look back at what happened with more clarity

You didn't really provide many explanations as to why you are a bad girlfriend other than one anecdote that resembles more an example of lack of communication than a wrongdoing. It's hard to tell what kind of relationship you were in, but judging from what you wrote I wouldn't blame this breakup on this specific argument. Please stop bashing yourself for this whole situation. You might have done some things better but I doubt that the relationship ended because of your request to spend more time together. And if that was really the only cause, then there is no way you could have saved the relationship, so stop blaming yourself.

It seems plausible to me that your relationship had long-standing issues. Why do you keep saying you're a bad girlfriend? What happened in the other relationships? Are there recurring ""mistakes"" you make in your relationships that eventually lead to a breakup?

This is the hardest time so please hang in there, ask for support to your family and the community here. I can promise you it will get better over time. Time ALWAYS works. Once this unbearable pain is over you can start working on your issues and on taking your life back. But for now, you have to fight, one hour at a time, one day at a time to keep moving forward."
mentalillness,fomp1nu,t3_g87shs,1587898565.0,"Personally I would try to understand if it's something you've always experienced or if your personality had a radical change over the last 2 years. Some people are less emotional and lacking in empathy. It might not be a blessing but it doesn't necessarily have to be an issue. Do you feel void of positive emotions too? Or is it just a lack of empathy and emotional attachment? 

Interesting point about the gruesome videos. I think there is nothing wrong per se in watching them, as many people are drawn to that kind of content. But I would want to make sure it doesn't become an obsession. I think this specific impulse could be used as a canary in the coal mine. You might want to make sure that your lack of empathy is not degenerating. One thing is accepting the existence of the shadow within us. Letting it take control is a totally different thing. Maybe you can do some inner research to see where the boundaries of your emotional situation are. Can you make friends? Are you attracted to girls or whatever? Is there anything you feel might be suppressing your emotions, or is it just the way you are? How is this affecting your life currently?

One comment about your parents' divorce. Sometimes we get emotionally damaged without realizing it, especially at such a young age. I'm not saying you're in denial. I'm suggesting you might not have the tools to understand whether damage was done and the extent of it.

Asking for professional advice is always a good idea though. If anything just to stop ruminating on your potential mental issues. Which rarely leads to good results."

I'm not a professional so I have no idea whether you need anti-depressants or not, but I think that the first step would be to think long and hard about what would be of your life if you don't do anything. Because I have a feeling you are not scared enough about your current situation. I think you're looking for an easy way out, a way to solve the situation without telling anyone. This is pretty much the same as not facing your problems. Trust me I'm not judging you. I think you made the right decision to share your problem here with us.

I'm sure you have the potential to achieve great things in life. But you need to be prepared to fight for them. It's really hard, but friends and family can really help.

mentalillness,fojpi5v,t3_g7p65y,1587826597.0,"I think what u/Mister-Dinky wrote pretty much sums it all up.

It's one of those situations where the first impulse is to say ""just stop worrying about it"". Which is, of course, the dumbest thing ever. I partially understand your issue as I often find myself ruminating about dumb shit I did even like 15 years ago. And sometimes I even blush while I think about it. My problem was not that this would lead me into a spiral of negative emotions. But it would just hold me back in life in general because it would keep me from taking risks in social settings. 

The way I partially solved it was accepting that I would never be the kind of person I expected myself to be. That I would never be perfect. And this allowed me to open up and become more ""human"" to the eyes of everyone. Having increased my social exposure, I realized that people, in general, are more forgiving than we believe them to be. They will, of course, remember your dumb mistakes. But most of them will get a good chuckle out of them when you meet up at the bar, and that's it. They don't keep a huge list of mistakes you made, just to remind you how pathetic you are every time you see them. 

Admittedly, all of the above applies only partially to a high school setting. People there can be fucking nasty. But even there, if you play your cards right you will not be haunted by your mistakes. Again, if you did some dumb stuff in the past (like everyone else), this means that you blew your opportunity to be flawless. Accept it and move on. I understand that it's easier said than done. But the point is that most likely you hold yourself to a higher standard than everyone else does.

Try to think that people judge you based on a wide spectrum of achievements and failures, and for how you interact with them. I hope I didn't sound like I'm belittling your issue. I fully understand it's a complex problem. Maybe if you shared more details with us it could help us better understand your situation."

Do you believe this is a widespread issue or is it something that only a few misguided individuals do?"
mentalillness,foj54xo,t1_fohj5x5,1587808764.0,"You must be in a really dark place in this period of your life. Not only are you in a struggle with your mental issues, but you're also trapped in a relationship that I can only define as toxic. Under normal circumstances, I would just tell you to distance yourself immediately and try to replace this person with someone else. Because this looks like a typical example of an unbalanced relationship. The fact that you both are vulnerable due to your mental problems adds a lot of complexity to the situation, requiring everyone to be a bit more careful when giving advice. 

I will put your enhanced vulnerability aside for a second and I will treat this as the average unbalanced relationship. In my opinion, the truth is that she is way more important to you than you are to her. And I feel this is evident to her too. You asked yourself why you're put in a subordinate position when you're the only one who's always been kind to her and put up with her mood swings. That's your answer for you I think. It's likely she takes you for granted. In general, people make an effort to get what they can't have. Whenever she needs you, you're there for her. But it's definitely not reciprocal. Not at the same level at least. And you are torturing yourself because you cannot have her. You can't have her attention and support to the level you wish you had. 

You also recounted the episode where she provided support to her ex bf but didn't show much empathy when you opened up to her about your problems. The sad truth is you can't force people to care about you. It's an awful reality but it is reality nonetheless. I believe your question of whether there is a way you can be seen in her eyes, perfectly describes your situation in this relationship. If there is anything that you can do to be more relevant to her, being less dependent is definitely it.

Now let me go back to your specific situation. I will admit that at this point I'm more concerned with your wellbeing than with hers. You came here to ask for help while she didn't and instead belittled all your attempts to help her. But at the same time, I still don't feel like telling you to abandon her. But I strongly suggest you start taking steps to change your position in the relationship. The way I see it, if this goes on like this, you will be the one to pay the higher costs. If you keep internalizing and enduring without reacting at some point you will become too weak to even help her. I believe that in order to help her effectively, your mental health must be solid. You need to first work on yourself if you want to be able to stick to her side in the long run. 

I've dragged it on for too long so I'll try to recap:

\- Stop putting her wellbeing before yours. You can only save a drowning person if you are strong enough to swim for both.

\- Look at your side of the relationship and try to see if there is anything unhealthy regarding your attachment to her. Coming to terms with reality can only make it easier for you to support her.

I will take the opportunity to make clear that I perfectly understand that I will never have a complete picture of what you're going through. Your struggle is your own. So please consider that, if you feel that anything I wrote is irrelevant or offensive."
mentalillness,fohgsto,t1_fog3lqx,1587765750.0,"Hold on you didn't mention suicidal thoughts. I think the picture is getting clearer. Btw I think you made the right decision to share your problems here. This is a big issue and you made the first step towards the solution.

Sorry for overlooking the fact that you mentioned you have mental issues as well. Initially, I didn't appreciate the severity of your problems. If you have suicidal thoughts this changes things drastically. You cannot suck it up and go on like this. And I hope you're seeking advice from a professional too.

Would I be completely off I said that the condition of dependency is reciprocal? Her opinion, whether biased due to her illness or not, seems to be very important to you. Which normally would be fine but in this case, we can agree that her judgment is a bit off. What stops you from trying to take a break from her?

Also, given what you report her as saying, it seems like she puts you on a lower level with respect to her other friends and family. Is it possible that your struggle with your mental issues made you vulnerable and put you in a subordinate position in your relationship with her? I'm not trying to make her into a villain, I want this to be clear. You are both victims that equally deserve to get better. But the way it is, this relationship is consuming you. So I think it deserves to be fully understood so you can make the most appropriate decision."
mentalillness,fohdayb,t1_fofznb6,1587764043.0,"The fact that once you start an activity you are totally absorbed by it doesn't necessarily mean that it's deeply meaningful to you. I can be extremely passionate and excited about something for a bit and then get bored. Like if you bought a new phone you'd be playing with it for a week and then it would just feel like the old phone it just replaced. I'm not saying you only engage in superficial activities. What I'm suggesting is that you might have an issue with motivation and possibly one way to cope with it would be to spend more time thinking about what could keep you engaged for a long time, before starting a new activity.

What happens when these ""depression"" phases end? Do you go back to being attracted by the same activities? I think it would be useful to understand if this loss of drive is caused by a factor that is independent of the activity (e.g. mental illness) or if it's caused by factors that are intrinsic in the performance of the activity itself. For example by the decrease in novel stimuli as you get accustomed to the activity.

It's against the rules of the sub to suggest diagnoses so I'll just suggest you get informed on Bipolar Disorder, and that you ask the advice of a professional if you feel that this is becoming unmanageable."
mentalillness,fog4rfa,t1_fof70r9,1587747872.0,"I totally agree with u/Twitchyboner. I would like to share my personal point of view though.

If you suffer from depression or any other mental illness, you are alone. Because people who have never experienced the horrors of those conditions simply cannot understand you. It's as if they lived on a different plane of existence. So if you feel like you need someone who can really understand what you're going through, I would suggest you talk to someone who's having/had similar issues. I'm quite sure you can find someone around here. You need to find a person that will nod and say ""yeah I know how that feels"" when you tell them about your worst moments. 

I don't want to sound pessimistic, I just think this is the reality of the situation. It sucks but accepting it could actually be beneficial. I'm sure your parents love you but I also think you should have a serious discussion about this so at least they stop downplaying your issues. If they use the usual tactics. make a mess, make them understand this is important for you. You can't expect them to understand you, but you can demand they make an effort to respect your condition. I'm sure they will understand. But be assertive.

As for what concerns feeling guilty about sharing your feelings with other people, I think you should feel free to talk to your best friends when you are in need. But at the same time try to refrain from continuously talking about your problems. And I simply wouldn't mention it to acquaintances. Unfortunately, people have very little patience when it comes to sad stories and anything that can kill the mood, especially if as complex as a mental illness. Again this might not be too uplifting but I think being pragmatic helps. I think in your situation you might also need people to hang out with occasionally. Sharing as little as possible about your mental state can help you keep those people close."
mentalillness,fofypqz,t1_foft9uv,1587745141.0,"I can honestly feel you really care about this person and it makes me sad to think that this is taking such a big toll on you. 

I'm not entirely convinced that having someone to hurt that doesn't fight back is the best help she can get. What if you take a break? Just to get some perspective and get some of that negativity out of your system. She's not going to take it well probably but that might be a consequence of her inability to open a dialogue with you. It wouldn't be a punishment of course, that's not the point. But it could help you cope with this while making the possibility of loosing you real for her.

Also, have you tried to analyze the way you internalize her mean comments to see if there is anything that can be done on your side to take things less personally? Reducing the drama could help deescalate the situation, making her swings less painful for you. Maybe you can look up some material on how to best support people with BPD.

Do you see any possible improvement in the medium term? Is she working on her issues? You mentioned the people in her life. Do you see that situation change over medium term? If you both had an objective in mind, it could make it easier for you to stay by her side. 

I think what you're doing is very noble and she's lucky to have a friend like you. I'm sure she knows that. I really hope things will get better for you both."
mentalillness,fofsqi0,t1_fofo21n,1587742160.0,"Yeah that doesn't leave much room for discussion.. 
Of course if you decide to help someone with BPD you know you will have to endure less than friendly behaviors. And you can't give up on your friend as soon as shit hits the fan. But that doesn't seem to be your case. I honestly believe you shouldn't discount your feelings in this situation. If you think that's selfish think of it this way: by refusing to consider your side of the story and acknowledge your needs, she is actually hurting herself. If the situation weighs heavier and heavier on you, at some point you might just give up. Who knows, maybe that's what she needs. A big scare can really open your eyes about your behavior in general. But given she is a vulnerable person I would do whatever it's possible to avoid such a drastic outcome.

Have you tried talking about this with her when she's calm and happy? You probably have, but you know sometimes it's hard to bring up unpleasant subjects when we are having a good time so we convince ourselves that that episode won't happen again."
mentalillness,fofn3tw,t3_g78bdv,1587739235.0,"That's a tough position to be in and you can ignore the mean comments for so long. Have you tried to set boundaries by asking her to take also your feelings into consideration? If done correctly that could actually show her that you are in for the long haul, potentially reducing her anxiety regarding being abandoned.
If you start seeing her comments as abuse, it is obvious that in the current state this relationship is not sustainable."
mentalillness,fobq0lb,t3_g6kz5k,1587662412.0,"Can't say I have your same issue but I do have a problem with commitment. After embarking on a new project I soon start to question it and my ability to succeed and then I tend to get demotivated and eventually I give up. Over time I trained myself to go through the whole process in my head before even starting so I don't waste time and money. This is not the advice part of the comment.

Are the activities you perform meaningful to you? Do you start a new project on a whim? It's not bad per se but sometimes you might be tricking yourself into believing that that thing is exactly what you need while in reality it's something that you would just like to explore for a limited period of time. In other words, do you consider if the activities you perform are a good fit for you? 

I personally found that spending the time to think deeply about what I really care about allowed me to identify some long term objectives that I thought would be worth pursuing. And this in turn gave me the drive to stick to my plan and eventually achieve them."
mentalillness,fo7datd,t1_fo7byx7,1587576379.0,"So it's not something that happens frequently. I guess you're looking for the exact name for your condition. It's very specific though. If this is something that is affecting you, even the possibility that it might happen again, then I would ask for professional help. 

I think you're lucky these episodes are not frequent. I wouldn't discard the possibility that they might be manifestations of an underlying excess of stress."
mentalillness,fo7acdf,t1_fo4pzgf,1587574951.0,"Yeah I get it it's extremely hard sometimes to explain your feelings when they are so different from what people normally experience. 
That's why I was more interested to know whether this was a one off event or one of many. And also it would be interesting to know if you felt anything unusual during the day before that episode."
mentalillness,fo4k0rz,t1_fo4fd4a,1587505825.0,"Yeah that makes perfect sense... I could have guessed what happened after college. I guess I'm biased because after college most of my friends ended up working in the same city, and that's just how it's supposed to be for that specific course. 

As for your business, well that's your decision of course. If it's taking more than it's giving then it makes sense to leave it behind. I personally find it very sad because I deeply admire entrepreneurs and I appreciate how tough it is to set up a business. But if you did it once you can do it twice.

Anyways, it's been a pleasure reading about your story. I wish you all the best. Maybe you can give us an update every once in a while, or maybe when the pandemic is over."
mentalillness,fo4is0s,t3_g5nt7e,1587505175.0,"Not a professional, but I'd be happy to listen to you if you feel like it. I have NON professional experience helping people out in difficult, mental health related situations.  
Do you feel like sharing more about your issue?"
mentalillness,fo4h374,t3_g5jdo1,1587504301.0,I'd say panic attack or anxiety attack. Is this your first experience of this kind? Or first weird experience in general? That could help find the cause.
mentalillness,fo31rwp,t1_fo0rper,1587478894.0,"  

Thank you for answering. I‚Äôm glad my point on setting the bar too high for happiness kinda made sense. I‚Äôd like to clarify this point though. My personal view is more like you‚Äôre probably a generally unhappy person who needs to put in an extra effort to maintain an acceptable level of happiness. This effort appears to be dynamism, whether it be in the form of a productive endeavor or a change of environment. The reason I wanted to clarify my point of view is that I don‚Äôt want you to think I was downplaying the importance of your problems. It is obvious that your negative emotions have played a major role in your life so far, and for this reason I believe their impact on your well being should be fully acknowledged.

As to whether your ‚Äútruly‚Äù depressed or not, I‚Äôm not sure what difference it would make knowing that. For sure there will always be someone who has it tougher than you. You‚Äôre not constantly unproductive and hopeless. But you wouldn‚Äôt be here sharing your storing with us if your mental issues didn‚Äôt have a meaningful impact on your life. And although you confirm that your depression comes and goes, I still get the feeling that your unhappiness is a common theme throughout your life, although it varies in intensity.

As for your college years, I can relate 100% to the feeling of having the chance to start a new life, leaving the failures of the past behind. But in your original post there is a gap between the end of college and your decision to move across the country. Did you stay in touch with your friends from college after graduation and before moving? If so, why did you decide to move? You say you‚Äôre missing meaningful relationships but your decision to move inevitably would end up putting a strain on those cherished relationships.

Last comment. You closed your original post asking what you should do. Given the how drastic some of the options you propose are, I would suggest you postpone making this kind of decisions for now. From what I understand reading your post, your depression and negative emotions have gotten to a point where you feel that you need to take action. I know what it means for the pain to become unbearable and I totally respect your need to act now. But given my privileged position as spectator, I suggest you try to get to the end of the lockdown without making decisions that would potentially destroy all you achieved as of lately. After the pandemic is over, you will still have the option to close your business and go home. Hopefully though, your mind will be clearer and less affected by a spike in depression.

Your story is very interesting, and I‚Äôd love to hear more details about it. In any case, I really hope you won‚Äôt give up to your mental issues, as I think there is potential for you to reach your personal form of happiness."
mentalillness,fo0paj4,t3_g50gza,1587417255.0,"I'm having a hard time understanding whether you are looking for advice in general or just related to this current situation. If it's just for the current situation, it's really sad to read that the lockdown is taking such a huge toll on you. When you consider how much you achieved, it's just awful to see that such a brief period of time can cause you so much pain. My humble suggestion would be to hang on in there and try to get through this dark moment in our history, keeping in mind that in all likelihood it won't be more than a tiny fraction of your whole life. If instead you're asking for advice regarding your general situation then I put together some comments.

First you mention that you were hoping that your business would be the ""secret to happiness"" , but that you were disappointed to find that that wasn't the case. Could it be that you were setting the bar too high? What does real happiness look like to you? My point of view could be a bit unpopular, but I believe that for some people, blissful happiness is just an unattainable dream. Which doesn't mean that you have to feel miserable all the time. Adjusting your expectations could help avoid the fallback when you realize that all your efforts didn't bring that much needed happiness. 

This brings me to the second point. There seems to be a pattern in your ups and downs. It seems like whenever you changed environment and engaged in a productive effort, you achieved great results, even though happiness escaped you. In the worst stages of depression one can barely get out of bed, so it seems unlikely to me that you were utterly depressed all the time. Can you identify what made you feel just a bit better? Again, I wouldn't try to look for that moment of perfect, movie-like happiness. 

Last thing, you mentioned that during college was when you were the happiest. Why do you think that was the case? What made it different from high school? Is there anything of that experience that you can recreate in your current life?(lockdown not withstanding) 

There are a lot of other questions I'd like to ask you but I think I already wrote too much. Please if at any point in my comment I sounded disrespectful please consider that all the questions were posed out of genuine curiosity, and any suggestion was given out of a genuine desire to help. Good luck with your happiness and your potential."
mentalillness,fo0ka76,t3_fsi4xh,1587414659.0,"I know a lot of people are experiencing a lot of anxiety and negative emotions in general due to the current situation. I know by experience that in some cases being able to share your thoughts with someone who can really listen can make the difference between being able to cope with the situation or not.

So if anyone wants to have a chat please don't hesitate to DM me. I'm not a professional by any means, but I learned a lot through my personal experiences and by helping many of my friends go through difficult situations.

I was lucky enough to have some good friends that listened and supported me when I went through my personal struggle. I can't even imagine how much harder it would have been if they had not been there. Which is why I don't want to think that there is someone out there who desperately needs someone to talk to but can't, because of the lockdown."
mentalillness,fnwbfu9,t3_g46k0d,1587315166.0,"Some of what you wrote really resonated with my personal experiences and with those of some of my friends. Reading through your post reminded me of those dark places I visited in my mind some time ago. It's not easy to convey such complex emotions in writing, so you definitely deserve some kudos for that.

I'd love to listen to your story and possibly provide support. I won't try to write some general uplifting post as I believe that every experience is specific and I don't want to over generalize. And you were willfully vague regarding your background. But as I said, I really feel there is something similar between what you're experiencing (at least given my understanding of it) and what I've been through. When I was going through a hard time, having friends that would listen to me was really fundamental for my survival I would say. While I was recovering I also had a chance to give back to my friends, by listening and providing support to a couple of them who were going through a life crisis themselves. I hope you have all the support you need, and I'm glad you are working with a counselor you seem to trust. But in case you wanted to share your experience with someone else, please DM me. I think it could be beneficial to us both.

Good luck with your wall."
