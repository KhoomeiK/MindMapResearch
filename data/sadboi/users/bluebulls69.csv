I'm hoping she can contact the foundation, explain what happened and they might make an exception. But I'm honestly not hopeful. I'm honestly livid.

Its gonna come out sooner or later and I'd rather not waste time with someone who,will run away when they find out. I understand I'm not an easy guy to get along with, especially in a relationship.

I am trying my best to learn tho and my girlfriend does teach me a lot especially recently as we've gotten more comfortable talking about it. But if i do say something painfully ignorant in this comment, I do sincerely apologize and please correct me because the more I learn and know the better I can be helpful for my woman. 

**

I've been with my girlfriend for 3 years and she wasnt on birth control when we met but she had until me never had sex, neither had I. Her mom never would have gotten her birth control had it been for the purpose of sex, it was until recently that she finally came to terms with the fact that she can't control every aspect of her daughter's life anyway. But she did last year finally get her birth control just not for the anti baby reason. My gf (for a lot of reasons both known and not) had really bad and really irregular periods. Like her cramps would leave her immobilized most days, which I didnt even realize wasnt normal until i asked her to try and teach me about it. Her period would range from 3 days to 7 days (which she said is pretty normal, and she usually would be around 5 or 6 anyway. 3 was rare) but it would sometimes be over a week late for no reason, or other times it would happen 2 weeks after it ended and then again in another 2 weeks on ""normal"" schedule. 

Long story short, she needed birth control to regulate and alleviate her periods. Which was the only reason her mom agreed to it. 
So as a man I say, PLEASE PROVIDE YOUR CHILD WITH BIRTH CONTROL ITS NOT JUST ABOUT SEX she was so miserable before she got on it and even though shes still working through finding the best pill (she doesn't want the implant or the other one. They scare her) she's way happier and way healthier now than she was before"

If you are hitting a wall where you keep hitting repetitive failure it's your job to make the decision to keep grinding away exactly as the program states, or to make the call and either extend rest times a little bit, shorten the punishment, adjust the reps or weights or whatever is best. Obviously you ideally want to follow everything the program says but like I said, Jeff doesnt know you. And besides it's about improving. If you have to adjust on one day where you keep failing, maybe repeat a phase or the whole program later and challenge yourself to not adjust next time, or if you think you can, up the difficulty more."
Markiplier,f9v04ee,t3_e6uumi,1575660786.0,"Mark said (aside from some of shit he was going through at the time) that he didnt agree with going through the shit of beating 50/20 with how much RNG there was. He knew it was possible but it was random at when it was possible and without the whole power up system it was virtually impossible. If anything i think it makes me more the king of fnaf because he recognized that beating it should be about pure skill and up to the gamers abilities, not rng."

Minecraft,f9npmg6,t3_e5z8co,1575488571.0,I found one of those. Was my third end city I found without getting an elytra too. Very salty but found a much bigger one with the ship shortly after. Once you realize they spawn along the east/west axis it goes a lot quicker

Minecraft,f9kpz3v,t1_f9j9wn1,1575405531.0,I made the clock of 8 repeaters all set at 4 ticks and gave it approximately a 2-3 second pulse. It's not SUPER efficient by any means but considering its just a cheap little iron farm im pleased until I build something bigger. I'll try to get a good picture when I get home
Minecraft,f9i94vo,t1_f9i0wp2,1575331285.0,I added that then just switched it to a clock continuously lifting him in and out of view and that drastically increased what I was getting. From less than a stack an hour to a stack and a half in the last 20 minutes alone. Thanks for the tip
Minecraft,f9ho7lf,t3_e528up,1575318559.0,I had beat the dragon and was exploring the end for more end cities and elytra when my current elytra broke and I fell into the void with all my best shit on me. Rage Quit and started over at that point.
Minecraft,f9hmhhv,t1_f9hmafw,1575317633.0,It's only giving about 48 ingots an hour. I'm new to making farms like this but that seems really slow
Minecraft,f8u14wf,t3_e27wrn,1574816435.0,"Beat my first dragon completely survival, no cheats or anything today. I've always just cheated whenever it felt more convenient but I never realized the satisfaction of playing without that."
