Coronavirus,fmoi05f,t1_fmlaj47,1586259607.0,"first dont panic! Take a deep breath.

First: Where do you live? Remember, evictions are time consuming and expensive - and require going to court. It‚Äôs difficult to evict a tenant even in good times. But right now, in many places the courts are closed. It‚Äôs going to be very difficult to find a new tenant to take your place simply because folks are not moving as much right now. So it‚Äôs in your landlords interest to get you to pay your rent, not throw you out. Remember that - you have a little more power than you think.

Second: many utility companies are state run which means many of them are waiving late fees and penalties right now - look into that.

So my point is: You‚Äôre going to have to pay rent eventually but there‚Äôs little a landlord can do to get it from you right this moment. Same for your utility bills. 

If I were you I‚Äôd message the landlord and the utility companies and let them know you fully intend to continue paying rent/utilities but will be late. Request that extensions be provided and fees waived in light of the situation. Ask if you can make partial payments. Tell them you‚Äôre waiting on unemployment and the stimulus check. 

Landlords have their own best interest in mind - but their best interest and yours overlap in some areas. They want to get their rent, and throwing you out and having an empty apartment that they cannot lease to someone new, is not going to get them what they want. Offer them a path to what they want - smaller payments spread out over a longer time. They‚Äôre much more likely to accept that than to try and evict you right now.

It‚Äôs going to be a hard time for you, to be sure. But please don‚Äôt panic. You still have some options."

The other rumor I heard is that he is going to the McCain Institute. That seems like a demotion to me, so who knows.

EDIT TO ADD: confirmed, he took a job at the McCain Institute, taking over for Kurt Volker (guy who was important in the impeachment proceedings). Source, my colleague's boyfriend works there."

Coronavirus,fknvup1,t3_fjnbcw,1584374981.0,I work in the aid industry and this has been rumored for a little while. It really has **nothing** to do with coronavirus.

Call the doctor and ask for a refill on birth control and that you‚Äôll come in in a few weeks or months for the appointment. Search around and see if you can find a drive through pharmacy and have your doc send it there. 

Honestly, we have no idea what areas are affected at this point. Better to delay a couple of appointments than contribute to the spread of this thing."
interestingasfuck,fklkbcm,t3_fj7w1s,1584308308.0,Oooh they‚Äôre so little. It makes my heart ache for some reason.
Coronavirus,fkkk4dt,t1_fkkhjq2,1584285843.0,"Yeah. That‚Äôs a start for sure. But the ripple effects are still there. Suspending evictions means landlords might not get paid. Suspending mortgages means loans don‚Äôt get paid. That‚Äôs okay - it‚Äôs temporary - but when banks don‚Äôt get paid, investment stops. This thing is going to grind the global economy to halt.

Again, not saying we shouldn‚Äôt do these things. Fuck, the economy shouldn‚Äôt be the end all be all of our decisions. But again that‚Äôs capitalism. If you‚Äôre looking for a reason why the US isn‚Äôt doing this stuff, that‚Äôs why. They don‚Äôt want to spur on a global Great Depression."
Coronavirus,fkk9ycv,t1_fkk3fry,1584278395.0,"...and also how to pay the landlords who make their living off the rent.

...and how to pay the farmers and food/bev distributors who make their living off of selling to restaurants.

...and how to pay the people who drive the trucks, or the people that service the ice machine and the dishwasher, or the exterminator. 

This is how capitalism works - it is all intricately connected. If we close all the bars and restaurants, the ripple effect would be tremendous. And that is just ONE industry. I'm not saying we shouldn't, but its not a simple fix like just compensating workers."
Coronavirus,fkk9lme,t1_fkk87qi,1584278093.0,LOL what the hell math are you looking at?! The margins are miniscule. Restaurants are the first to go in a recession. A few bad weeks can kill a restaurant. A few bad months WILL kill a restaurant. It is incredibly difficult to succeed in the restaurant industry in good economic times.

I‚Äôve worked really hard to just be as mindful of it as I can. when my heart is getting ahead of my head, I‚Äôve learned to take a beat and try and see observe what‚Äôs going on in there. Like ‚Äúoh I‚Äôm really grasping for something here, what is it? Oh I‚Äôm grasping for him to like me. I barely know him, why do I care? Because I feel like if he likes me that means I‚Äôm okay, I‚Äôm good. But I already know that I‚Äôm okay and good.‚Äù It just helps me stop the spiraling into more obsessive behavior patterns."

datingoverthirty,fkh6nma,t1_fkgs1bf,1584190420.0,"Exactly! 

I don‚Äôt have trust issues so much as I don‚Äôt tolerate being lied to and disrespected anymore."
