So these terms are used a lot and get mixed up a lot. So from [this](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mayank_Sehdev/publication/324958487/figure/fig1/AS:622731926183936@1525482269691/The-structures-of-typical-AWD-4WD-transmissions-Engine-An-engine-is-the-powerhouse-of.png) image you can see AWD and 4WD. The primary difference is distribution of power and this comes with many advantages and drawbacks. Keep in mind, outside the US there isn't this kind of distinction. Outside the US, AWD includes 4WD (or vice versa) but for explanation's sake, I'll be using the AWD and 4WD systems in the image linked to simply explain the difference. 

So an AWD system can provide power to all wheels. These can be part-time which are electronically managed on a need basis, or full-time where a set amount is sent to the front and rear, say 20% front 80% rear (essentially its more common that most of the power is in the rear). More often than not AWD systems do not have a transfer case, they have a center diff built into the engine/transmission assembly and functions a lot like a transaxle.

In a 4WD system, you often have a transfer case that splits the power between the front and rear wheels by usually 50/50. From there they go to what are called ""locking"" differentials and then to the wheels. There are other types of differential such as open differentials and LSDs but for now lets stick with locking diffs. Locking diffs allow the user to lock either or both of the front and rear differential so that torque can be distributed 50/50 to the two wheels its connected to. So in the end, every wheel is receiving 25% of the torque coming out of the engine. However the drawback of this is that you can only move forward or backward as the diffs are locked and won't respond well to a turn. A turn requires two wheels to spin at different speeds and its a problem if they cant do that.

Advantages of AWD? It's much lighter and is often enough for roads when slippery conditions do occur. They're used in everything from every day cars to performance cars and are great because you don't have to necessarily go SUV, many sedans have AWD. It's also an automatic system that's electronically controlled so it's seamless. 

Disadvantages of AWD? Not for off-roading. I mean, yes you can do some light off-roading, but nowhere near to the same degree as 4WD vehicles. There's also a limit to what an AWD system can do. Often times if you're in snow and one front wheel has no traction and one rear wheel has no traction you'll get two spinning wheels and the car wont move. This is very rare and good tires with a collapsible shovel usually mitigates it but it's still a thing.

Advantages of 4WD? Great for off-roading and very difficult to get stuck. They are versatile as you can select the drive-mode you want to go in and they allow vehicles to go places they normally don't go. 

Disadvantages of 4WD? Heavier and often limited to SUVs. They aren't electronically controlled to the extent that AWD systems are and are often less fuel efficient. Often a more expensive option if you're not actually doing off-roading.

The take-away: AWD is preferable to the everyday consumer that won't be doing a lot of offroading. 4WD is preferable to those that go offroading or experience similar conditions via weather or where you live. If you get a ton of snow or you drive on dirt a lot, 4WD. If you drive on the road most of the time with the occasional dirt path, AWD."
educationalgifs,fnvm2mi,t1_fnuxzmw,1587298178.0,"That's actually a great question.

So first, it's important to keep in mind just how an engine turns linear momentum into angular momentum. [This](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ac/Cshaft.gif) gif shows the pistons and crankshaft all functioning to turn the linear momentum of the pistons into angular momentum of the output shaft. Another thing to keep in mind is that the crankshaft is responsible for the timing of the engine. In [this](https://media.giphy.com/media/IheewDzC0n3G0/giphy.gif) gif you can see the operation of the pistons. This is an important concept to keep in mind, that when the gasoline/air mixture combusts, it pushes the piston so that the combustion can expand. The piston, connected to the crankshaft via connecting rod, then drives the crankshaft thus producing the angular momentum of the crankshaft and ultimately the flywheel.

Now engines are not invincible. When the clutch connects the output shaft to the transmission and the transmission is in, say first gear, it'll experience a load that the crankshaft must overcome. What I mean is that when the engine is still and in first gear, all of the gears in the transmission will be connected and the only disconnect left would be at the clutch. When you release the clutch, a spinning flywheel and a still clutch disk will meet and one of two things will happen. Either the clutch disk starts to spin, and thus the car, or the load required to spin the clutch disk is too great and it stops the engine (or burns the clutch if the clutch has poor friction). Remember that the flywheel is directly connected to the crankshaft. So it makes sense that this happens. If the flywheel slows down, so does the operation of the engine since the crankshaft slows as a result of the flywheel slowing down.

So why start in first gear? Because of the load. So as you can see in the transmission diagram above, there's a green shaft, a red shaft, and blue gears. The green shaft is irrelevant for now, we just need to remember that the green shaft directly connects to the red shaft and is inseparable from it, so its always spinning. So this is where we get into the ratios of the gears which is actually pretty straightforward. A gear ratio is how torque and angular speed can be scaled. This is very much like leverage but for torque. A fantastic example would be [this](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/upZzupRcUSNEtUAosiNWfin0atDjnmZz2vZ0fkRtw5X2hhcUxaq7eMKnkTcD49WEA7vkLk-FDX9xEa_lr7f5-6uia-ovPc5uo2rbiydawTSlWWE) gif. Gear A has 20 teeth and gear B has 40. This means that for every rotation of gear A, gear B completes half a rotation, this is a 2:1 gear ratio. The key thing to take away from this is that if you're applying torque to gear A, that torque is amplified when gear B spins but at the cost of slower speed. In essence, it's torque amplification at the cost of speed. With enough gears, ant could literally tow a 50 ton tank but it would take it a very long time. On the opposite end, if you're applying torque to gear B, a single rotation would mean two rotations on gear A's side. Effectively spreading out the torque as opposed to concentrating it and adding speed to gear A in the process.

How does that relate to the vehicle? Well back to the gears in the gif of this post, an engine can't simply connect to the wheels and suddenly pull 1.5 tons of metal. So it starts with 1st gear which, referencing the gif of the post, is a small gear driving a much larger gear. At idle, the engine's crankshaft spins at 1500 RPM, but your wheels start out at 0, so a small red gear to a much larger blue gear allows the red gear to operate at the high RPM it's getting from the engine yet gently push the car to start moving because of the gear ratio it's in. For instance if that gear ratio is 10:1, 1500 rpm becomes 150 rpm which may be say 5mph at the wheels. As you ease off the clutch, the clutch disk has to transfer the power to a still transmission. That's OK though because it can slip for a bit as the car gets up to speed, it's not locked in like a gear."
educationalgifs,fnuqday,t1_fnuniqo,1587268387.0,"Haha I appreciate that. I'm not a professor, infact I still have professors, but I'm a very perspective-oriented type of guy. I'm passionate about a lot of things though but it's rare that I get to talk about them, let alone to this many people."
educationalgifs,fnumirs,t1_fnu15sr,1587265664.0,"Now for the driveshaft.

The idea is pretty simple. The torque coming out of the transmission is ready to be sent to the wheels as it's been translated to the torque ratio that the driver has selected. This is where the driveshaft comes in. They come in all shapes, sizes, materials, but the idea is all the same: transmit power to the wheels.

So [this](https://www.quadratec.com/sites/default/files/styles/product_zoomed/public/WOO-Shaft-FR_01_JK_52301-9830.jpg) is your standard driveshaft. Again, they come in all shapes, sizes, materials, but that is a common looking driveshaft for rear wheel drive vehicles. Speaking of which, we have to take a look at drive-trains before getting into the complexities.

Now there's 4 types of drive-trains that you'll encounter in consumer cars: Rear Wheel Drive (RWD), Front Wheel Drive (FWD), All Wheel Drive (AWD), and 4 Wheel Drive (4WD). [This](https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7008/13778638125_c61459e0f8_b.jpg) is a great example of a simplified RWD and FWD drivetrain diagram. Also [FWD](https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2016/02/Front-Wheel-Drive-2.jpg) and [RWD](https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2016/02/Rear-Wheel-Drive-2.jpg) look like that in terms of the car as a whole, just to make it easier to visualize. Then there's [4WD/AWD](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mayank_Sehdev/publication/324958487/figure/fig1/AS:622731926183936@1525482269691/The-structures-of-typical-AWD-4WD-transmissions-Engine-An-engine-is-the-powerhouse-of.png). I'll explain the differences to greater detail in a second, for now, lets backtrack to the driveshaft.

The driveshaft itself looks all weird, why? Well it's often the case that it has to account for a difference in height between the transmission's output and the differential it connects to. [This](https://i.stack.imgur.com/xHxvs.jpg) would be a great example of how to transfer torque to a different plane (the ball thing on the very right is the differential, someone forgot to label it?). Think of it like this, you have a shaft coming out of the transmission, the rod goes completely straight back towards the differential except the differential is say 3 inches lower than where the shaft is. You can't simply *bend* it. So they use a series of U-joints that do [this](https://d2t1xqejof9utc.cloudfront.net/screenshots/pics/d3425b89f8de83dfe76b951087b3c72b/large.gif) to transmit that torque to a different plane.

Now, back to the drive-trains.

FWD drive-trains are often compact and have what is called a ""transaxle"" which is a differential and a transmission in the same housing. I can go into specific detail if you want but let's just end FWD drivetrains with that they simply connect a [CV axle](https://www.testingautos.com/car_care/images/front-cv-axle.jpg) from the transaxle to the wheel and call it a day.

RWD is as explained, a driveshaft from the transmission to the differential. But there's two more: 4WD and AWD. Both use almost the same rear wheel drive set up as a RWD car. Using the ""4WD/AWD"" image above, [this](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-4Vab82rwmCo/WK8-Q4A5dJI/AAAAAAAAA9s/LPbJgmjvhZUW_AAsRcJpgEAEl5TdyXCXgCMQC/s400/Astro-AWD-layout.jpg) super-simplified image shows a specific component, the transfer case, and how it links up with the rest of the system. The transfer case transfers power to the front differential (and then the wheels) yet keeping power going back to the rear differential as well. [This](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-eNRz9DoLaqI/VucQnCyW8SI/AAAAAAAAGBc/Hwp3TNOnF9oIeb_XglhVTSLMTnKKaGeag/s1600/transfer-case.png) diagram illustrates the inner works of the transfer case, note the rear and front output shafts and the chain linking them together. This is what allows the drive-train to provide power to the front of a 4WD system. An AWD system is essentially a mix of a FWD and RWD drivetrain with a transaxle driving the front and a driveshaft going to the rear differential.

I did not go into detail on a great many things such as the differentials and 4WD vs AWD. I'd be happy to explain those if you'd like but this an overview of driveshafts! Let me know if anything needs clarifying!

EDIT: Had to fix a mistake. Used the wrong image for 4wd and awd."
educationalgifs,fntxspt,t1_fntqdmg,1587250651.0,"Sure! 

So the whole premise behind a clutch is to be able to disconnect the engine from the transmission and then ease the disconnected shafts within the transmission back up to the engine's rev speed.

Why is this useful? Well when you're switching gears for example, the blue gears and pink gears will often be rotating at different speeds. Not ideal for when you want to link them because when you try, you'll grind the gears as the teeth of the gears are moving at different speeds and can't quite come together. It doesn't help that the engine is always providing power to the red gears either. 

Now the transmission has a built in mechanism that helps the pink gears connect to the blue gears by trying to match the speed of the light blue shaft and the red shaft. But again, difficult for them to match speeds if the engine is constantly applying torque to the red shaft (which is spinning the blue gears that the pink gears are trying to merge with). So what do you do? Disconnect the engine from the transmission.

This is where the clutch comes in. Now I want you to imagine two large discs with shafts coming out of opposite ends like this: -----||----- One of these shafts come from the engine (the crank shaft which is actually a weird shape, but that's irrelevant) and the other shaft is the green input shaft for the transmission. The two discs in the center is where the disconnect happens. On one end is the flywheel that's always spinning at engine speed, and the other is the clutch. This is a very simplified view of it, there's more to them but im setting a basis for how it disconnects.

How does it work? Well one of the plates, the engine's plate, is called the flywheel. The other plate is the clutch disc. The clutch disk has a bunch of friction material on it and presses against the flywheel to transmit the engine's power to the transmission. It's very much like how we understand friction, you open a jar by squeezing tight on it and using friction and torque to open the jar. In the same way, the clutch plate presses tight onto the spinning flywheel to spin with it and transmit the torque to the transmission. There also has to be something to push the clutch disc onto the flywheel really hard. That something is essentially a spring, the pressure plate, that forces the clutch against the flywheel. There's also a housing that backs the spring. 

How does ""pressing the clutch"" work into this? So there's this other type of spring, a diaphragm spring. This is basically a fancy looking disc that, when pushed, pulls the pressure plate off of the clutch disc. This is the equivalent of trying to open a jar without pressing your fingers against the jar's lid. Thus, power disconnect. Then when you ""release the clutch"" you're actually letting the pressure plate push against the clutch pack again which pushes against the flywheel, transmitting power to the transmission that the clutch pack is connected to.

EDIT: Thank you for the gold, Glad I can help! Let me know if there's anything else anyone is curious about or anything that needs clarifying."
educationalgifs,fntl28k,t1_fnsn7m1,1587243803.0,"Ok, so there's many important things in this ""educational"" gif that are not explained.

So to start, this is a manual transmission.

The Green shaft is the output shaft coming from the engine (actually the clutch but effectively the engine). The green shaft is directly connected (inseparable) to the red shaft via gears. The red shaft's gears are directly connected (inseparable) to the blue gears. However, the blue gears are *not* directly connected to the light blue shaft they're spinning on. Meaning the blue gears spin loosely on the light blue shaft. The light blue shaft goes to the wheels (first to a differential or transfer case but the point is that they lead to the wheels). So, when the engine is running and the transmission is in neutral, the green shaft, red shaft and gears, and blue gears are all spinning.

Now what happens when a gear is shifted? Well as you can see, there's those pink gears. Those pink gears are directly connected to the light blue shaft in a way in which they can still move up and down but do not spin independent of the light blue shaft. This is important. The pink gears move up and down so that they can connect to the blue gears when the gears shift, but they cannot spin faster or slower than the light blue shaft they sit on.

When the driver shifts into a gear, the pink gears connect to the blue gears, which again are always spinning because of the torque coming from the engine. Now remember that the pink gears cannot spin independent of the light blue shaft, so what does that mean? The light blue shaft starts to move because the connection between the pink gears and the blue gears force it to rotate, thus the car moves.

Now why the hell is there so many gears? Different ratios. You cant directly connect your engine to your wheels. Your engine revs from about 1500 rpm to 6k or 7k rpm and can reach max rpm fairly quickly. That doesn't easily translate to the rpm of your wheels at various speeds. So the gear ratios are for different wheel speeds for consistent acceleration at different speeds."

HistoryMemes,fnsayqs,t1_fnrr1e3,1587217524.0,"It's actually a smarter strategy than what it appears to be on the surface. Before, the US only supplied Israel, then there was a war backed by the Soviets against Israel in the 6 day war. But now the US funds Egypt, Iraq, and the Saudis. No more major offensives against Israel as the US has influence over every nation in the region besides Iran and Syria. If you're a superpower and you're NOT doing this, you won't be a superpower for long.

Here's the thing, you still have Hamas who is likely backed by Saudis that attack Israel. This is good because this justifies a much greater defense spending for Israel. This, with the help of American assistance money, turns a small Jewish state into a Middle Eastern superpower. That superpower is a close US ally. So, everyone sees ""Saudis vs Iran vs Israel"" or something but in reality its ""Weak Russian influenced states vs Strong American influenced states"" because the name of the game today is proxy warfare, cyberwarfare, and information warfare."

AbruptChaos,fnr4xbw,t1_fnr4ses,1587179386.0,Not enough to cause the arcing seen in the vid though. Even the most powerful gaming PC out there can't carry the load necessary to do something like that.
Coronavirus,fnr4pcx,t1_fnpqpm5,1587179232.0,"Antibiotics does nothing against a virus if that's what you're asking. Antivirals are for viruses but antivirals aren't generalized. Meaning, one antibiotic can kill many types of bacteria but each antiviral is specific to a particular virus or group of viruses. Even then coronavirus likely isnt affected by any antivirals.

EDIT: Nvm sorry"
AbruptChaos,fnqz7ad,t1_fnqu4oa,1587175498.0,"By that, fine yes ""hundreds of amps"" but at 1.1 volts. Again, not enough power to arc the way seen in the video, not even close. That amp calculation is deceptive because it implies ""high amperage"" yet it's very low voltage and never used through a single circuit. Also, home circuit breakers for recepticals are rated for 15 amps or 20 amps, at the very highest 50 amps (for dryers, washers, etc). Dryers, water heaters, fridges all take much more power than the most powerful consumer PCs out there as those require special outlets rated for more power (often supplying 220v). 

TL;DR:

Your standard residential outlet that you see in your house is rated for 110v at 15a which equates to 1,650 watts. A 9900k needs 150w, just less than 10% of the total capacity of a standard outlet. And I've never seen a 15a outlet arc the way it did in the vid. *That* calculation puts it into perspective, PCs dont consume the power required for that kind of arcing. Infact, arcing has more to do with voltage than anything and even then 1.1v wont arc if you tried. 110v barely arcs."
AbruptChaos,fnqndkr,t1_fnqluga,1587168108.0,"That's just wrong. Standard residential receptacles carry a maximum of 15 amps. You need to double check your sources. I think you mean milliamps, definitely not amps."
AbruptChaos,fnqhdop,t1_fnqh8ar,1587164641.0,"Power supply yes. Except not a bright flash arc. Sparks require little power, bright arcing requires a shit ton not available in a gaming PC."
AbruptChaos,fnqe4ys,t1_fnpl525,1587162825.0,"Not at all. There's no way a GPU fan can withstand the current required to make such a bright flash. This is very likely fake.

1. The ""bang"" you hear isn't right at all. An electrical short can make a ""boom"" sound but only with REALLY high current. No gaming PC on Earth uses the current required to make the boom heard in the video. Btw that ""boom"" sounds like someone dropped a textbook.

2. The short has bright white light coming out of the back of GPU of all places. You simply cannot push a PC hard enough to do that without serious modifications. The CPU has limits and safeties, the PSU has safeties, the motherboard has limits and safeties, etc. Things on the brink of failure *burn.* They don't suddenly explode."

TerminallyStupid,fnkrw0t,t1_fnkrc3q,1587038143.0,"I saw the Taiwan incident. That doesn't throw out the WHO's reputation nor does it prove that it's a Chinese puppet. China is among its biggest contributors, it's likely that they didn't want to step on their toes in order to keep receiving funding. Regardless at the end of the day, the US is out and not because of reasons you stated. Trump didn't cut funding to the WHO because he thinks it's a Chinese puppet, that's just some shit his fans came up with to defend him. The sole reason he cut funding is because he alleges that they didnt act quickly enough and mismanaged the spread. That was the reason he gave and that was the ONLY reason. He's wrong. The WHO warned everyone in January of the spread, only for Trump to shut things down at the end of March. Trump said nothing about it being a Chinese puppet, that wasn't his reason, that's just some side shit his supporters are desperately clinging to ignoring the fact that his reasons are BS as they literally warned everyone months before the president took action."
TerminallyStupid,fnkr7dt,t1_fnkofk2,1587037532.0,"Wrong. The US and a number of European nations contributed much more than China and Russia. About triple what they were contributing combined. Now that the US cut funding and other EU nations didn't (because Trump didn't coordinate with them since he's as strategic as a 4 year old), the only thing that happens to the WHO is that the US won't have a voice in it and now China can step up to the plate and fund them."
