If their descendants do not match your ancestors wrt names and locations, then it is likely just a coincidence. But that family is likely so well documented it should be easy to find a link when building downward if they are your family.

I have found this extremely useful in a couple of cases, mainly to connect with cousins. But I am doing it right now with the hopes - and a really strong suspicion, based on locations, migration, family first names and associated families, if I can just narrow down the branch - of cracking a 15 year brick wall. Building down has its own frustrations, but in some ways it is a lot easier than building backward."
Genealogy,fqzy70t,t1_fqzaik2,1589778419.0,"Unfortunately, you cannot trust the ethnicity estimate for stuff like this. They are more of an art than a science, and Ancestry is quite hit or miss with accuracy. 

Build up what you can of your mom's side, like u/duck31967 said, so you can more easily rule out relatives on her side of the family. If you can, try to go back to at least 3x great grand. Then, if Ms J does not link up to your mom, you have a much more solid place to start.

You are likely to share either 2x great grandparents or one grandparent with her, so if she is on your dad's side and is willing to help, you might try building out all of her 2x great grandparents' known descendants. Use your shared matches with her to try and figure out which of her ancestors are yours, too. If you search for the Leeds method, like u/duck31967 said, you should be able to narrow things down a little."

Genealogy,fqr0jv9,t3_gkek1l,1589575349.0,"[Ancestry.com](https://Ancestry.com) results can be uploaded to a bunch of places, as can 23andMe. Those two companies do not allow results from other companies to be uploaded to their sites, so if you have family on one or the other, you may want to use that service.

Ancestry tends to have more U.S. matches. In my experience, more of my non American and non English cousins have been on 23andMe, mainly from Ireland, Germany and the Philippines. That said, MyHeritage has actually been most useful for me for finding non-American cousins, and it takes uploads from both Ancestry and 23andMe.

Without an Ancestry subscription, you won't be able to access records or user-created trees that are not linked to a DNA match. However, if your matches have linked their trees, you will get a limited preview of those without a subscription. Ancestry also has a nice color coding tool. I have not found ThruLines very useful for anything but checking my tree, and even then it is iffy.

23andMe is just getting into the tree game late, and you cannot see other users trees unless they link to them or connect their account to FamilySearch, which sucks. It does have a chromosome browser, which I have found incredibly useful. Ancestry doesn't have that. In my experience, their broad results are a lot more accurate regarding the ethnicity estimate, but Ancestry has tool that uses your matches trees to pinpoint small communities or migrations that is pretty cool ... if you get assigned any.

MyHeritage has the smallest database of the three but the best genealogy tools IMO, especially the clustering tool. If you upload from elsewhere, you have to unlock their tools with a onetime payment, but I believe it is about twenty dollars, which is not bad at all. This won't give access to records, but will let you use their chromosome browser. Just keep in mind that their ethnicity estimate is hot garbage and it will look different from your first set of results and it will likely be very wrong.

tldr, and just my opinion, go with Ancestry if you are trying to crack brick walls, or if your family has been in the U.S. for a few centuries. Go with 23andMe if your family is not American or is only recently arrived, or if you want fun extras like Neanderthal variants, mtDNA (general, not very genealogically useful other than to rule out matrilineal links). In either case, upload to MyHeritage and, once you can spare twenty bucks, unlock their genealogy tools, which are very nice."

That said, it's entirely possible you can use the Leeds method to separate her matches into four groups, one for each grandparent, and use that to find her parents, if you can find close enough matches. It will just take some work, first to separate your paternal matches out, and then to use shared matches to try and split her side up. The obstacles will be if she doesn't have close enough matches on both sides, or if she was a second-generation adoptee or something. If there are a lot of missing trees, you may also have to build some from scratch, which is usually doable but time consuming. (Tips on this that have worked for me - looking for unusual names or reverse image searching to find people on Facebook, then seeing if I can determine family; searching for unusual names plus obituary to see if they've been named in a grandparent or parent's memorial; checking BeenVerified/MyLife/etc. for name plus location, if they give one. That usually gives enough to get you going if they're in the U.S.)

If you have determined Nickname McLockedTree does not have any paternal matches, it might be worth reaching out, but screenshot what you can first in case they block you. Sometimes people don't want to get involved. If most of their matches are to your paternal side or to both and they are not a close relative, you can set them aside for now and come back to them later, when their FindAGrave activity might be more useful.

You have John and Catherine Anderson with their daughter Helena and Catherine's inferred kids James, Millard, Jeff and Lurana Keys starting on line 13. 

Then you have Priscilla Parrico next door on line 20, who is almost certainly Priscilla Suarez, given her age. Living with her is Ada Knox, Sidney O'Neal and Parrico O'Neal. I would guess at this point that Eliza in 1860 was Priscilla's daughter or granddaughter, and the Knoxes and O'Neals were her children, based on them continuing to live with Priscilla and how they were listed in the household in 1860. They also have a boarder, James Rex, it looks like. No sign of the younger Charles Knox, but he would have been 20 by then, so could be on his own, boarding where he works, any number of things.

I'm not sure if Priscilla and her family were related to Catherine and her family, but it seems like they were close, if they were living together in 1860 and neighbors in 1870.

Here is the Anderson-Keys family on the 1880 census, if you don't have it already, listing the Keys kids as John's stepchildren.

My guess would be 1855, which would make her the right age to be the Ada in the 1860 census. With her inferred brother being Charles Knox and both of them living with Elizabeth Suarez, it would make sense.

However, there is a record book from the cemetery which also lists her birthdate as 1865, so I am not sure. The informant is her daughter Ruby, who gives her age as 70.

Still not sure that is the same Ada, as she seems to give her birth fairly consistently as 1865. Her race is listed as mulatto in 1920, but white in 1930 and on her death record. I am not finding her or Ruben/Fernando at all between their marriage and 1920.

So far, I haven't found much of anything about others in the household. There is a Sidney O'Neal transcribed on the 1870 census who fits all of the info for this Sidney, but the record has been removed and the image it links to plus the pages on either side seem to be Sidney-less.

My guess would be, given the timing before the Emancipation Proclamation and Civil War and their lack of inclusion in the 1850 census, that these families either bought their freedom or were freed by the families above (aside from maaaaybe Peter Suarez, I didn't see any obvious Keys, Suarez, Knox or O'Neal names listed on the 1850 slave schedule, so this might be a longshot unless they were buying slaves just to free them), and were renting rooms from Richard Riggs as u/The_Little_Bollix said. You might find mention in wills or probate files, if they were freed upon someone's death. I am not sure if or where you would be able to find records if they freed themselves.

ETA The O'Neals in the Riggs household were likely related to the neighbor O'Neals like u/The_Little_Bollix suggested, but since they are listed as mulatto and the neighbors are all listed as white, it may be that they were living next door for propriety's sake. It's possible one of the women in the Riggs-Swarris-Keys household was their mother or aunt, maybe.

ETA 2 It also does not list Riggs as owning any property. I wonder if they were all living in a house belonging to the O'Neals next door? Maybe Riggs was a boarder, too. I don't believe he was an overseer, since T.M. Brown had that listed as his occupation further down the page. I don't think they would have left it off for Richard Riggs. And the Keys, Swarrises, Knoxes and O'Neals in the Riggs household being listed on the census seems to indicate they were free and not enslaved."

First off, BC Milner seems to be head of household for the family after the Riggs household. I think the census taker just put the household number of the wrong line. They all have the surname Milner and are the right ages to be his wife and kids, and BC has property info, which usually only HoHs do. What is interesting to me is that no one in the Riggs-Swarris-Keys household has an occupation listed.

There are a bunch of Swarris and Keys families on this 1866 census of Alabama, in Baldwin County. None of the Swarris and Keys members of the Riggs household seem to be among them. The transcription lists them all as white.

There is an R. Riggs living in Baldwin County in 1855 with three free people of color. The tab title says mortality schedule but it is not, it is an 1855 statewide census. [https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/3:1:33SQ-GGTF-FCH](https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/3:1:33SQ-GGTF-FCH)

This might be the same guy, Richard Riggs in Baldwin County, but by 1866 none of the others are living with him. He also seems to have not aged at all. [https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/3:1:33SQ-GGTF-FMP?cc=1915987&personaUrl=%2Fark%3A%2F61903%2F1%3A1%3AV6PL-K1B](https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/3:1:33SQ-GGTF-FMP?cc=1915987&personaUrl=%2Fark%3A%2F61903%2F1%3A1%3AV6PL-K1B)

I cannot find him before or after those censuses with a quick search, but you might see if there are land records and if he appears on them. There is also a James Riggs on that 1855 census who may be related.

There are a bunch of Swarrises on the 1860 census, mainly from Florida and Alabama and mainly white. That surname seems to disappear from the county and like, most of the U.S. after 1866. Doing some digging in the US GenWeb archives, they list a Joseph Swarez buying land in 1841. There are also Joseph and George Suares buying land in the 1870s and 1880s, and Peter and Joseph Suarez in the early 1900s. [http://files.usgwarchives.net/al/baldwin/land/blm/baldwin-p-s.txt](http://files.usgwarchives.net/al/baldwin/land/blm/baldwin-p-s.txt) With the Florida origin for a bunch of the family, my guess is Swarris should actually be Suarez and the census taker took a best guess. There do not seem to be any Riggs or Reggs land records on here, and the only Key is much later, but it might not be complete.

I have not done a ton of Southern research, but if I remember the pre-Civil War census rules correctly, only free people of color were listed on the official census, while enslaved people were recorded on the slave schedule. So it seems like Catherine, her kids, the Swarrises or Suarezes, etc. were all free."

You may have to do a little detective work and see if you can build your closer maternal matches' trees back a little further - at least until you can find a place where they overlap. To do this, you'll need to use shared matches to split your grandmother's branch from your grandfather's, which it sounds like you've started. If they're second or third cousins, you shouldn't have to go too far back. FamilySearch.org is a great place to start."

There are a few good guides online if you search for Leeds method genealogy.

If your mom is willing to test (or even your dad), that would help a lot. If you use the same testing service, it will automatically ""attach"" your relatives to your parent or ""not parent"" (if only one tests), or to the relevant parent if both test.

You can also upload raw data to MyHeritage, GEDMatch FTDNA, LivingDNA, etc. to see if you get additional matches. 

Do you have any clues as to where your mom was adopted from?

ETA: Saw in another reply you have ancestry from New Mexico and Colorado.

I have bipolar myself and my ""everything is boring and pointless"" depression triggers the same behaviors hypomania does for me - losing myself in a hobby, ignoring everyone I care about, letting daily tasks slide. The motivations are different - trying to shut my brain off and distract myself from misery versus ""I'm gonna become a professional gamer and make a ton of money on Twitch so I need to buy a new computer and practice all day right now!"" - but to my family and friends, it looks the same.

If one of your mystery second great-grandmothers is your matrilineal ancestor (i.e., your mother's mother's mother's mother) you may also consider the mtDNA test at FTDNA. They test much more thoroughly than 23andMe, so that test can actually be used to find matrilineal matches and for genealogy. The downsides: their database is quite small, and mtDNA mutates much less frequently than Y-DNA, so there is a decent chance you may not have close enough matches to actually find it useful.

For a 2x-great-grandmother, personally I'd do the big two (Ancestry and 23andMe) and upload raw data to MyHeritage and maybe GEDMatch for matches, then try to use the Leeds method to narrow it down. If you Google ""Leeds method genealogy"" there are a bunch of good guides.

* Workers supporting groceries, pharmacies and other retail **that sells food and beverage products**
* Retail **fuel centers** such as gas stations and truck stops, and the distribution systems that support them

Not seeing any other retail on there. Note that the first bullet does not include bars or nightclubs, even though you could argue that whiskey is a beverage product."
California,fkzx59e,t3_flmjpu,1584683196.0,I hope everyone who partied on Tuesday feels like a real asshole right now.
tarot,fky0pod,t1_fkxdfpe,1584639127.0,"Original poster - The person who started the thread. 

Also fell asleep before I could edit, but these are standard size cards. I've just been using the Crow Tarot a lot lately and it's a little wider than most. My mistake!"
tarot,fkwkdx8,t1_fkt4hsm,1584595219.0,"Not OP, but it is! I just got mine today (ordered through a local bookstore and they were told they wouldn't be getting shipments until March 30 because of the lockdown, but got one last one this morning).

It's GORGEOUS. The colors are amazing, the artwork is obviously fantastic. It's a little smaller than many decks - not poker sized, but as someone with small hands, it's just about perfect."
23andme,fknyxz8,t3_fjnihb,1584376780.0,"Probably the Italian, especially if it's from southern Italy. There's a lot of eastern Mediterranean admixture there and Ancestry kind of sucks at Italian.

Of note: Syrian-Lebanese (and anything with a dotted line) is a Genetic Community that is determined through your matches, their trees, your tree, and how you all match with their sample population from that region. It just means that you have some ancestry from that area, not that the full 59% is from that region."
tarot,fknymhe,t3_fjn7z4,1584376592.0,It's been the Wheel of Fortune and Two of Pentacles for me. I feel like I get one or the other in two-thirds of my multi-card pulls regardless of deck.
23andme,fknw2ah,t1_fkmxmza,1584375106.0,"Ethnicity estimates are a terrible way to tell this unless there are continental-level surprises (like the guy who was a quarter Japanese when his parents were both white).

DNA matches are a better measure. OP, do you have close cousins (3rd cousins or closer) or other relatives that you recognize from both sides?"
Genealogy,fknv885,t3_fjahbz,1584374614.0,"A not uncommon number of surnames started as nicknames for one person that got carried on by descendants. This could be a case like that, maybe?

When they were adopted really depends on where your family lived - I have ancestors who used patronymics until the British takeover of New Amsterdam and New Sweden in the 1600s, for example."
Genealogy,fknusfe,t1_fklxo4n,1584374354.0,"It depends on if the newspaper maintains its own archive or not. I work at one - we have microfiche but our reader is busted. Fortunately, we did put up through 2009 on the Google News Archive, and after that is on Legacy, but other papers in our boat may not have. And if a paper has folded ...

Library would be my first suggestion in any case."
23andme,fknuchf,t3_fjmpys,1584374092.0,"Honestly with the pandemic the normal schedule of things night get really thrown off. I know their main lab is in NC which isn't hit hard yet, but I could see some of their employees getting tapped to work in testing labs or something since they're experienced in DNA extraction. (I'm in the area of Northern California that's hit pretty hard so maybe I have a skewed view - everything is shutting down here.)

Normally, the whole process takes about 6-8 weeks. I don't think any of us can really guess right now."
