ragdolls,fqe26ia,t1_fqe15ee,1589300537.0,"> Again, if you read anything I wrote to you above, health and wellbeing are correlated with the pedigree. 

Yes I understand that, and I did read it but as I have said to you before cause I did answer this, the grandparents and the Mum and Dad have both been tested for any genetic diseases they may have and paperwork will come with my kitten regarding this. I know this because aside from Dad, the Mum and Grandparents were part of a previous litter she said. I have seen the Mum and Dad and the grandparents of the Mum as well too. They are happy and healthy and I said I reached out to someone who has bought two cats from a previous litter from her (one that looks similar to my current cat) and I asked specifically if he had encountered any massive health problems with either of his two cats in the years that he has had them and it was a no. But thank you again for trying to clarify. 

Also, thank you for the last answer, that was literally all you needed to say. Please leave me be."
ragdolls,fqe00te,t1_fqdygbv,1589299509.0,"No in my original post, I said nothing about Minks. I said I thought he might be one to you in a reply but she never advertised him to me as one. She advertised him to me as a solid colour not a Mink. Not the same thing...

I sent you a DM request because I thought you would be helpful but the way you are talking is not helpful, just shunning me for my decisions plus in my original comment back to you I also said I don't care about whether he is 100% pedigree at the end of the day, I care more about his health and wellbeing. I never said I didn't want the truth and in my original comment I was being polite to you and saying that whilst that may be the truth (I never denied you were telling the truth, just said what I thought) that I cared more about him as a cat and I didn't matter to me as long as he is happy and healthy. I have also spoke to another ragdoll breeder in my area and asked how much this mattered and she said as long as the cat is happy, healthy and has been tested and I'm happy too, it really shouldn't matter. So I don't know why you are saying I'm ignoring the truth? Anyway, please leave me alone now, we have both said our piece, I only replied because I wanted to set things straight. I wish you a good day."
ragdolls,fqds7r9,t1_fqdqpfn,1589295677.0,"Look honestly, I'm not supporting a backyard breeder. If you read the website at all you would know and be able see what cats she has breed in the past. I have also been in contact with someone else that has bought cats from her before both who are healthy and a happy cats who have reached adulthood. Why does this matter so much to you? You say you don't care but obviously you do, you care a lot. 

Definition of backyard breeder for you as she is none of those things-> It implies either or both of home breeding for non-commercial reasons or a for-profit small commercial operation that does not adhere to good breeding, care and sale practices.¬†

So I suggest you stop calling people that without any evidence. I deleted the post because I did not wish to keep talking to you specifically as even though you think you may be being helpful, which it seemed you were, you're actually just really rude and a gatekeeper. I do understand the importance of this to you but you're way too focused on what the cat should be/or isn't (i.e. A Ragdoll not A ""Mink"" Ragdoll) and not what the cat actually is, which is happy, healthy, he comes neutered and with all injections and correct paperwork and he is very playful and Mum and Dad are healthy and happy. So I would like it if you would please leave me alone now? As I have answered most of your questions and the cats best interest is at heart, they are healthy and I have made sure of that as well as her reputation with other people who have gone to her before."
ragdolls,fqc3dgo,t1_fqc1yjh,1589249279.0,"Did you check the links at all? They weren't advertising them. Not as rares or minks. And they're not committing fraud. I've read your comment history and according to you everyone is a ""backyard breeder"". She has done the health checks and there are many people on her instagram that have tagged her in posts with their healthy growing kittens. Also, you're wrong about Minks [https://ranchinragzragdolls.com/what-is-a-mink-ragdoll/](https://ranchinragzragdolls.com/what-is-a-mink-ragdoll/) several people have sent this to you before but you don't seem to pay attention so I don't expect you to pay attention to me. Also, can I ask how much you ***think*** I'm paying for this cat? Cause you seem to think I'm paying loads. If it's happy and it's healthy, which both Mum and Dad have been tested. Does it matter? She does sell actual, what you would accept, as ragdolls too...

I also just want to say she also gets them neutured and gives them the jab before she gives them to you...which seem to be your other criteria. I just wanna say even though you do not accept Minks, that I can understand why people feel as though they are unable to post about them here or even ask questions..."
ragdolls,fqb41e7,t1_fqb3e4y,1589230206.0,"I have already asked her regarding the HCM and she does have certificates for the HCM, she said that he comes with the certificates as well. She has also sent me pictures and videos of the Mum and Dad (as I can't see them right now because of lockdown) I didn't see the rare Mink Ragdoll online and go to buy it, I contacted her through her website to see if she had any kittens available. I can give you that if you would like? She also has a YouTube account. As up until now, I didn't think she was a non reputable backyard breeder but see what you think for yourself? I would really value your opinion in this.

ragdolls,fqb21zu,t1_fqb1bj6,1589229210.0,"I think they got the figure from the cats lineage as she has been breeding ragdolls (both pure and mixed) and british shorthairs for years. I know it's not just them being big and fluffy that makes them a ragdoll, I think he has paperwork with him too but I'm not sure yet as I haven't got him, still a couple of weeks till I bring him home. When looking up, he looks like a Mink Ragdoll. Neither of these things bother me.  For me, he was no more expensive than other cats so that doesn't really bother me lol but I do get what you mean.

pcgaming,fehpca9,t3_eogouh,1579121186.0,Is it bad if you have like one massive fps drop? Was playing NUNS4 just a minute ago and fps dropped from 60 to 35fps. Hasn't done this before and this is the first time. Other PC games play relatively well with smaller fps drops.
StarWars,feg4l78,t1_fef7hq9,1579076649.0,I thought that might've been what he was going to sayüòÖ. Thank you for answering btw. I can now put my mind to rest about this.
StarWars,feeuv66,t3_eoh0h4,1579041714.0,Can I ask does anyone know what it was Finn wanted to tell Rey? This has been bugging me since I went to see it and I don't know if there was something I missed or what!

Finland,fdg8qcv,t1_fdfu7n9,1578384811.0,"Hi, thank you for your advice, where I'm looking to stay is in Lapland so hopefully, I should be all good on that front. 

Can I just ask if I'm going near the end of October, what season will it be? Cause I know seasons work differently in the world. Here in the UK it won't be winter yet, it'll still be autumn."
Finland,fddk80s,t3_e95htt,1578315506.0,"Hi all, 

I've looked up on Google and the answers seem to always change so I thought I'd ask here. I'm trying to plan a trip to Finland for my 21st birthday later on this year and I'm wondering when would be the best time of year to get a chance to see the Northern Lights? (I know it's a luck of the draw kind of thing but I wanna have a little bit more a chance). I'm looking to go around 26th to the 30th of October."
AskPhotography,fcsqzvx,t1_fcsqy9y,1577922903.0,Okay thank you very much for the adviceüòÅ.
AskPhotography,fcsqqa0,t1_fcsqm16,1577922712.0,"Oh, sorry I'm afraid I don't know. I'll have to look up and see if I can find out what shutter speed it was taken at somehow."
AskPhotography,fcsqf5b,t1_fcsq3vx,1577922486.0,According to the website the shutter speed is a 1/7500 to 1/2 second.
AskPhotography,fcspw18,t1_fcspejp,1577922109.0,"Yeah, I spoke to a friend about it that also has one and she said the same, that it can sometimes be hit and miss and she thinks it depends on whether you are too close to the camera as well. 

I am definitely trying to be more careful about that and having AF Illuminator on seems to help. 

I haven't really been able to take any outside yet but I have taken some inside and they have come out more clear. For example: http://imgur.com/gallery/aAoTS8E so I do think it is just a case of me getting used to using the camera a bit moreüòÖ"
AskPhotography,fcsokmc,t1_fcsmip7,1577921168.0,"No, I don't think so. I only got the film over Christmas and made sure it wasn't near heat. 

Here is what I mean by fuzzy, it isn't unclear you can still see the subjects and whatever, it just doesn't look 100% crystal clear ->https://imgur.com/gallery/fE3oEIS"
firefox,fcnvji1,t1_fcnvejg,1577819278.0,"Yeah, I shall try too. I don't really understand it but I shall try, thank youüòä"
