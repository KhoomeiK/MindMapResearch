It was awful and lasted weeks. I finally cut my routine down to just cleanser, hydrating serum and moisturizer, but now whenever i try a new product, i breakout with the same type of acne. I thought it was a damaged moisture barrier, then an allergy to detergent, then i thought it was hormones (32, female), then i thought it was stress. I have seen a derm and an aestetician and no one has helped me. just made things worse. i tried to figure out ingredients but they are so hard to pin point what could be causing the issue. do you think this is something for an allergist? it tends to get worse around my period, but any time i do a mask, try a new lotion, anything, i get the white heads and bumps. and the white heads never seem to go away. i get 3-4 every day.

My Eventually my skin looked and felt normal again so introduced a very low grade retinol for sensitive skin and that helped my skin look even better. I purged a bit in the beginning but the derm told me that would happen, then my skin was resurfaced and looking great. After a few months of that I wanted to try a new moisturizer balm and after 24 hours i got that tight/red irritated skin again. Seems like a vicious cycle.

Unless you have an itch or someone is humming loudly in your ear, or you're bleeding from a wound, usually you have no problem if you are truly present. Which means the problems you are focused on are of the future or past, to which we can do nothing about.

Are weekends just a big no-no for people? Like they don't want to spend their precious weekend at a bday? Or am I reading too far into it?). 

However, the tickets are $12, it's an event we have all attended several times over the years and everyone loves it, myself included (it's an all summer thing on the weekends), and I know they have attended bdays there before for other friends. Also, I know money is not an issue for anyone. Maybe they didn't want to go again? But I wish they had the decency to say yes or no to me rather than ignoring entirely. Makes me feel like they don't really value me as a friend when they ignore something like a birthday invite.

I thought maybe I should just meet at a bar, or do nothing with friends all together! But I wanted to go to this event and thought it would be more fun with friends. It was a purely organic attempt to get friends together because I miss them and don't get to see them all that often. I know I can't expect people to drop things for me, a few were busy, but it's wild that out of all my friends, only one is coming. I know I just need to drop the pressure, have fun, and move on. It's tough when you're anxious, though!"
Anxiety,ewfi6j8,t1_ewfcikz,1565361396.0,"Thank you. You're right - it's not a reflection of me. I can't control what people will/won't do, only what I do. I just need to go and enjoy the company that is coming and take the pressure off. Just sucks we live in a society now that has normalized ignoring event invites. A simple yes or no is all I want. And maybe they themselves have fear of commitment or other issues, but it's hard for me to believe it because they go to parties and other things all the time.

Also makes me really want to isolate myself again but I need to learn to rise above this old habit my brain so badly wants to fold back into because it's ""safe."" And yes, I should be proud of myself at the step I took of being vulnerable. DEEP BREATHS! :)"
Anxiety,ewfhqrg,t1_ewffemt,1565361110.0,"Thanks. Appreciate it! The tickets were $12 and it's also an event that my friends have done/like to do. I thought it might be a barrier because it's an extra layer of commitment - and to your point, i have found people in their late 20s and 30s HATE committing to things, which for someone like me, sucks. I also considered maybe people have already gone to the event recently (it's all summer long), so may not have  wanted to go again.

 I just wish people had the decency to say yes or no. The invite was a regular email (not an evite or anything), which is how most of my friends do invites these days, and i know the people I sent it to check their email religiously because we have communicated that way before. I specifically have one group of friends in my circle where we have a group chat of sorts going there. So it bothers me that they couldn't even acknowledge it.

I'd reach out again but TBH, adding another layer of vulnerability makes me think I'll look desperate for people to come which makes me think I'm just seeking validation. Another problem to add to the bucket! But this was really a simple attempt to spend my bday with friends. I thought it would be fun to go to this event because I know my friends like it, as do I, and even more fun together."
Anxiety,ewepab3,t1_eweoy0e,1565331987.0,"I would cancel but the event requires tickets that I already bought for my husband and I, and I am sure she bought. I am starting to just think I have to do something completely different on my own for my bday because this will have a cloud hanging over it making it difficult to enjoy my birthday."
AskReddit,ew6387o,t3_cmsad5,1565152516.0,"Just because you've worked somewhere for a year doesn't mean you deserve a promotion or a huge raise. I work with a lot of young, just out of college, people who think they are owed a promotion because of time spent at a job. Not how it works. Don't be an entitled one."

videos,evm22jt,t1_evj1iwo,1564602216.0,"I do but when it comes to work, I‚Äôm not into this back and forth over slack when I know the greeting isn‚Äôt necessarily genuine, and they just need something. I‚Äôd rather not be bothered with the chit chat and just get straight to the point so we can all get back to what we were working on."

whole30,eviuzn6,t3_cjy53f,1564549940.0,"A great book that i found more valuable that whole30 books or Food Freedom is called The Food Therapist. It gets to the bottom of your hangups around diet and eating habits and is really, really great. I struggle with yo-yo dieting and the all or nothing mentality, which leads to derailing my diet. This book helps you focus on your future self/goals, and better understand your habits and why you have them, plus how to beat them. I can't recommend it enough."
videos,eviuchr,t1_evio2sl,1564549580.0,Same. Or when idiot coworkers ask if they can ask a question instead of asking the question. Or ask how you are before saying what they want. JUST SAY IT.
videos,eviu5wf,t1_evi7cdf,1564549478.0,"The only thing worse than people who can't give a straight answer are people who text like this:

Scenario 1:

Friend: can i ask a question?

Scenario 2:

Person: Hey! How are you?

Me: Fine, thanks. You?

Person: Good...so i need a favor....

IF YOU WANT SOMETHING JUST COME OUT AND SAY IT. DON'T STRETCH IT OUT."
AskReddit,eva7z0p,t3_cityyq,1564341103.0,"language. i find it interesting how so many americans think many europeans who live here are dumb because they can't speak our language well, or maybe they think it because they have a hard time articulating exactly what they want to say because english is their second, or maybe third language. Or that they should learn it better if they're going to live here. But they usually speak several, and can speak english way better than most of us can speak any other language. Sure, we take spanish in high school because it's a requirement (not sure if it's a CA thing or what), but most of them are fluent in a few languages."
