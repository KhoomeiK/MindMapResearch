TalkTherapy,fqnhuzg,t1_fqmsiv2,1589495126.0,">I think when you make healthy choices (setting boundaries, investing in relationships, pursuing things you enjoy) a lot of progress happens in the background.

I mean, I totally agree with this and feel this; but also, that's kind of... the story of my entire life leading up to going to therapy? And it led me to: wanting to go to therapy. Like I'm not saying I've never made mistakes in my life, but my perspective has always been one of authentically serving myself/my own mental health while building mutual respect with other people, following my passions, and constantly striving to learn to communicate better. And like now I'm old and bitter and alienated from a bunch of people I used to be close with, and just generally emotionally unstable. So then I go into therapy and they say stuff like ""you're already doing all the right stuff! Keep on truckin!"" it feels... invalidating, because I'm like ""well clearly something isn't working right here, and I was kinda hoping therapy could help me figure out what."" Like I read books on nonviolent communication that talk about how the ways we've been taught to communicate don't match our values and I'm like ""Yeah! That! That's the stuff I *wanted* from therapy!""

EDIT: Like after I had been in therapy for six months and it wasn't working, I looked up some articles about ""what to do when therapy doesn't work"" and it was all stuff that like... I had already tried, years before seeking therapy in some cases. Like, ""try to mend your hard relationships with family members/loved ones"" and it's like dude, I only sought therapy after having a lot of trouble doing that stuff on my own for a long time. Or like, ""meditate"" or ""try meds"" and like... I do do those things, and they help, but it ain't exactly hitting as hard as I want it to?"
TalkTherapy,fqne3xd,t3_gjpy6n,1589493220.0,"I mean, I relate to this a lot, as someone who also sought therapy for trauma about a year and a half ago and had... nothing good come of it basically. I feel like I was in a panic attack that lasted for months and like none of the shit I learned in therapy was really helping that much. Mostly I just got triggered during therapy and couldn't remember what we talked about afterwards. Like how do you deal with the intersection of ""therapy as a place you learn"" and memory loss caused by PTSD?  I fired my most recent therapist in January for being a sexist shit and honestly I have been doing a hell of a lot better since then. Maybe talk therapy just isn't for me. I more suspect that the therapists that I was dealing with sucked, but I definitely dealt with a few different ones.

But. What do you actually do when you're in this situation? I hear what you're saying about pushing too hard, and just constantly thinking about all the bad shit. But I also feel like I'm not getting any younger here, I'm suffering every day, and as far as I can tell I have to make some HUGE changes to my lifestyle. Which I'm currently not capable of due to the mental illnesses which require those huge lifestyle changes. To think about things less, I have to stop thinking about things I can't stop thinking about less? That feels like a catch-22. Or like a meditation teacher saying ""alright cool just uhhh clear your mind of all thoughts and attain enlightenment real quick I'll be right back I'm gonna grab a coffee."" I feel if I could control what I think about, I wouldn't even be in this situation of feeling hopeless and needing therapy in the first place.

Anyway, part of me would like to go back to therapy, part of my trust in the overall therapeutic process is just shot. Like apparently you can engage with this stuff from an intellectually honest and self-critical perspective for a *long* time and still not have any perceivable positive effect. I know healing isn't linear but damn. Like what am I doing wrong here? Should I really just have kept going to therapists who seemed incompetent/unprofessional/bigoted? I reliably argue with therapists more than I have with anyone else in any part of my entire life; personal, professional, spiritual, familial... It's kind of weird, honestly. I get along pretty well with most folks I meet going about my day, except for *the professional empaths/conversationalist*s, who I'm just like constantly butting heads with.

Friends of mine invite me to events of theirs all the time and I can't make it. Taking something like that personally kinda makes someone an asshole. Being like, ""Too bad, but I guess I'll see [insert friend] next time, they sound busy"" costs $0. 

Like, should I just *not* be friends with my friends who have schizophrenia or PTSD just because sometimes it's not totally awesome and fun? I have a hard time being around men sometimes because of trauma; should I *not be friends with men* because it's not always easy? Should I *not* make the effort to see my friends who work 60hrs a week on their schedules, rather than my own?

Taking it a step further. There's been awkwardness in friendships of mine with: women when I was being a little bit sexist, people of color when I was being a little bit racist, queer people when I was being a little bit homo/transphobic, working class people when I was expressing my own middle class ignorance, etc. But each time, when I was was criticized, I recognized that the friends of mine who came with me to these issues did so because they thought I could do better. If they thought I was just an ignorant bigot, they would've written me off, but because I was open to being wrong and talking with them, not only did our friendship gain trust but I also gained perspective & insight on how to treat everyone around me better, and have the way I was being perceived match my values.

aspergers,fqi140b,t1_fqgle4d,1589388031.0,"I mean. I pretty much holistically disagree with this. Anything that isn't hard isn't worth doing.

I have a pretty fucked up relationship with my parents. We've had a lot of arguments. Lots of not great times. I've also put a shit ton of hard work into improving that relationship and learning how to communicate with them better, while respecting both myself and them. Nothing about this was easy or pleasant. It's taken years of conscious effort and it's still far from perfect.

Some of my closest friends. We've had a lot of beef. But I also learn how to communicate better... learned important things about myself and the world from our arguments, and the contradictions in how we see the world.

Only having ""relationships that are easy"" means you will only have relationships of convenience. I want to be around people who challenge me to be better. Easy relationships = shallow relationships. I have plenty of acquaintances who I, like, see at shows occasionally and am totally friends with, and have never had a disagreement of any kind. Are these the people I call up for help when shit goes down? Absolutely not, I barely know those people.

Conflict avoidance destroys intimacy (obviously intense conflict also destroys intimacy, it's a balancing act). I've found in my life that the most abusive, flighty people were the ones who thought ""friendships should be easy!

ptsd,fqelm38,t1_fqe4zl5,1589309592.0,"This is a super long post and honestly feel no pressure to read it, but it was helpful for me to read your comment and type out this response, so I really appreciate you for that.

>I hate to be that guy, but im wondering how you went through 15 therapists in one year who knew nothing about trauma. Were they actually psychologists?

I mean, it's a reasonable question, and honestly I'm as baffled as you are. For the first six months or so I had the same therapist who definitely was a trauma specialist... I came to her to do EMDR, but she kept saying that we had to ""wait"" for another 2-3 weeks to do EMDR and not really explaining her reason... anyway then due to circumstances I had to move and obviously had to find a different therapist before we ever started EMDR. Also I kind of hated her anyway because she didn't believe me when I told her I was in an abusive relationship when I was younger, but couldn't really explain why in a way that made sense to me or seemed like... ethical at all, especially for someone who was supposedly trauma-informed.

Anyway after I moved, that was when I like seriously could not find a therapist who seemed to know much about PTSD. I found a bunch of people who were mainly knowledgeable about depression/anxiety and like, relationship counseling (not really relevant to me at the moment, sadly) who said they could do stuff with me about trauma... but usually within 3-6 sessions I would get fed up of them not doing anything to address my daily triggers and decide I needed to find a new therapist. That's how I ended up going to so many in a year.

I only started shifting up this quickly because 1. I was frustrated from already spending 6 months in therapy while wrecked/suicidal and 2. I read some articles online about ""what to do when therapy doesn't work"" and they said something like ""while long term it's important to find a therapist you get along with and stick it out for the long haul, if you still feel very uncomfortable in the third session, it's fine to think about moving on to a different therapist"" and that was pretty much... how I felt dealing with most of the therapists I did meet with. I've actually never met with a therapist who I felt like was taking my problems seriously or actually empathizing with me, and I try to check myself for what I'm doing wrong or what I'm projecting onto them.

Like it was just stupid shit. One time I missed an appointment due to unmedicated ADHD and my therapist like, took it super personally and said a bunch of stuff about how ""if I wasn't committed to the process there was nothing he could to do help me"" and it was just like brugh. ADHD is one of the things I am *trying to get help with in therapy, and you are currently not helping me with*.

Another one of my therapists told me he thought I was experiencing ""learned helplessness"" AKA the state of not trying new things because you were sick of things not working. But I said something like ""dude, you're like the fourth new therapist I've had in six months, I'm taking meds for the first time in my life, I constantly new read books about PTSD, I'm basically committing my entire life to working out, learning nonviolent communication skills, eating better, and learning coping strategies -- all totally new things to me. Frustration that I'm still getting triggered and into arguments with my friends nearly every day in spite of all that doesn't feel like the same thing as learned helplessness to me."" He was acting like I was just sitting around all day waiting to die, and I felt like I was struggling for my life and still drowning while he stood around with a life preserver, not throwing it.

This is the kind of stuff that I encountered everywhere. It felt super invalidating and like, borderline victim blaming... I know that I have a tendency towards black and white thinking that I'm trying to address. I'm also aware that many of my symptoms make it harder for me to engage with therapeutic processes, but what I need is a therapist who recognizes that is not necessarily conscious decision I'm aware of? Maybe it needs to be pointed out to me? Like obviously, advice/support on better engaging in the process is something I would hope to get out of therapy...

>It took be almost 2 months to really feel comfortable with my therapist and trust her abilities.

I kinda wonder if this is part of my problem? I just went into therapy with an attitude of total trust in my therapist and the process. I felt comfortable opening up about any of my trauma because I was like ""I have a problem, this is a professional who can help me, this is no different from how you don't lie to your doctor or your lawyer."" I honestly like, I get it when people don't want to talk about the shitty things that happened to them, but I'm the opposite. I am bubbling the fuck up to talk about some of the shitty things that happened to me. I overshare on social media all the time, which is part of why I started going to therapy -- I needed someone to talk to!

So to go from a place of total trust, and then be 4-6 months in and still feeling like shit, I realized that was where the trust and confidence started breaking down. It's almost like the better I get to know therapists, the more cynical I get about them, rather than the opposite, which is how it should work. Hm, I guess this is something to think about.

>It cannot be understated that my healing process was compounded by my economic security and stable living situation.. as long as you find something even mildly stable and non stressful that would help a lot.

Honestly, this is kinda the worst part. I'm from a well-off family and also saved up a bunch of money coding before I got too unwell to work. I could kinda feel it coming on in the same way that I could feel my relationship with my partner falling apart. I stacked up a tidy bit of savings which I've just been living off of in a low-rent house with roommates (never legally married, no kids but let's just say I am feeling the divorced dad vibes all the same). I haven't worked in like almost a year and a half... When I initially stopped working it was like ""cool, time to figure out my shit, process that breakup, and get back in the game in maybe six months or a year with a cool new job and a cool new sweetie"" and now after 1.5 years of meds and therapy I'm just like... fuck dude, I'm never gonna work again, I should probably just get on disability, and also I'm still in love with my ex.

Like, I'm very grateful for how privileged I am, I don't mean to complain about my financial situation at all. I feel a huge amount of empathy for people who don't have opportunities like this in their lives to reset and focus on healing. And I'm like, fuck, how much worse off would I be if I had been working this whole time?!

>Finally, for me a false trigger is a trigger to anything that does not truly present a real threat. Like an otherwise stable girl i trust holding a knife to chop veggies near me isnt a real danger. But a girl I was dating showed up at my place in a manic state making no sense. That was a real trigger. For me, exposure therapy to false triggers lessened them for me while also totally isolating myself from real triggers.

I really appreciate this explanation, thank you. So it's sort of like the difference between something triggering you because it merely reminds you of your trauma, versus something triggering you because it is actually a new potential source of trauma. Am I getting that right?

>And finally, my cousin was in the army and deployed to Afghanistan. He got PTSD. He told me something like, for most cases, major PTSD symptoms dry up after 6 months. For me, it seems that people who have enduring chronic PTSD had a whole bunch of other problems stewing way before the traumatizing event happened. Treating those problems could pull the carpet beneath your PTSD making it easier to manage.

Yeah, I mean, I definitely have C-PTSD from childhood trauma, being in physically abusive romantic relationships as an adult, and allegedly getting in some gnarly street fights with scene nazis when I was a young punk. So it's a very different and much more subtle/nuanced thing than PTSD from like war etc. I don't have really bad trauma from one event or specific part of my life, I have like, *kind of* shitty trauma -- like nowhere near as bad as like, being in battles in Afghanistan, or being sexually assaulted, or anything like that; more just like a lot of drug/booze-fueled abandonment, neglect, withholding, manipulation, gaslighting, and fistfights -- interspersed with *some* good memories from... every period of my entire life. One of the gnarliest parts is that I have *some* good, wholesome, positive memories with essentially all of my abusers, right? I'm not going to try to directly compare that to the trauma from going to war with people you've never met and have no personal relationship to, beyond saying that it's a totally different thing.

I also have a lot of issues beyond CPTSD, certainly; at the very least, chronic ADHD, anxiety, depression, rejection sensitivity dysphoria, and some sort of sensory disorder which I suspect is borderline ASD. Then it kind of becomes this issue of: how do I engage all of those issues in a 1 hour meeting 1 time a week, plus a once-a-month meeting with a psychiatrist?

So now I'm just like. I still feel definitely too shitty to go out and get a job or date anything like that (not that that's much of a vibe right now anyway with the whole virus/economic collapse situation). But I do feel somewhat better than I did a year ago, even though I'm still angry and frustrated. I have energy, I don't have to work, I want to get better, I still believe that I can get better; I'm just honestly not sure what the next steps to take are at this point.

If you read this far, thank you, haha."
adhd_anxiety,fqcw8qi,t3_gi4qqc,1589271066.0,"Yeah, I relate to this. I don't have a great solution, unfortunately. Most of my jobs have been like I found my assignments in school: either way too easy -- and thus boring/deeply uninspiring (& probably also low paying as an adult) -- or way too difficult, with very little in between. Basically, whenever I have a chill job that I can't fuck up, it feels too unimportant (not in a, like, ""I'm too good for this!"" kind of way, but more in a like ""what the fuck is the point of this business even being here"" sense); but whenever I have a job where fucking up has consequences, I get too stressed.

It's one thing that I find so frustrating about how many ADHD resources are aimed at children.

CPTSD,fqc9vs7,t3_ghrpwq,1589253217.0,"Yup, it took me a long time to figure out that I didn't suck; I was just around depressed people who were projecting their issues onto me while also being unwilling to analyze themselves or ever admit fault. Compromising can be a virtue and a sign of emotional maturity, but you also have to know when people aren't willing to compromise with *you*. Two overused phrases that I'm gonna use anyway: respect is a two-way street, and actions speak louder than words.

I hung out with people who made me feel shitty about myself because that was how my parents raised me. Through doing some therapy and reading I was able to understand how I had been unconsciously seeking out the abusive dynamics from my childhood + previous fucked up relationships/friendships because I thought that I could ""save"" my inner child by resolving, if not the original fucked up relationships, perhaps resolving a relationship that *resembled* it enough that it would give me peace.

It's not good for me or the other person in that situation. I don't blame any of the people I got involved with; there are no toxic people, only toxic behaviors, and it takes two to tango. Maybe we'll be able to be friends again someday. But. I had to get real about what I actually wanted out of life, and I had to learn to respect myself & the other person enough to tell people when I had an issue with their behavior. It's a lot of work to resolve conflicts in a peaceful, transformative, and mutually-affirming manner, and thanks to my parents I had basically none of the vocabulary or skills necessary to make it happen. So I just avoided problems completely. I was looking to desperately hold onto relationships that were like porcelain, where we pretended everything was perfect until it all came crashing down. Now I understand that healthy relationships are much stronger *because* they have been broken in small, manageable ways, and mended so many times that the relationship *gains* intimacy and trust whenever another conflict arises.

It's hard to speak up for myself when I've been so taught (gaslit!) to question myself. But I have much nicer friends now, who are down to sit with me through the real shit. Folks who are willing to self reflect on what they might have done to contribute to a conflict as well, or at least don't fucking blame me for 100% of everything whenever something doesn't go according to plan. And let me tell you. When you've struggled together, been through real shit together, *exposed* yourself truly to another person, and they affirm you, share vulnerability, and you both do the work to build each other back up... It makes the good times that are coming later so much damn better.

I don't really have any *specific* advice there because it wasn't easy to find a new group of friends when I was feeling so fucked up. I just went to a bunch of shows and met people in the scene, but that's not really an option with the quarantine... I'll just say this, which may be helpful: the only good part of hanging out with so many people who weren't treating me right was that it made me pretty good at detecting them. It gave me a real clear idea of how I *don't* want to be treated, so now whenever I get those vibes off of someone I can either talk to them about it directly (in a respectful way, of course) or just pump the brakes on the friendship a little bit. There's also nothing wrong with having a few more casual friendships as well.

I do relate to a lot of people's experiences with bipolar, but maybe that's just because my life has been so impacted by extreme symptoms in general.

I'm like 100% sure about not so intense ASD and pretty intense ADHD... only 50% sure about bipolar. I'm on a waiting list for a formal ASD evaluation; my current psych said he doesn't think I'm autistic, but he's also not a neuropsychologist and would obviously defer to the formal diagnosis if/when I get it (this is a reasonable attitude to me, and since he's willing to talk about the sensory difficulties I'm experiencing, I don't really care what he calls it in his notes haha). My previous psychiatrist was very convinced that I had bipolar, but I switched due to a whole insurance thing before actually getting any meds for it. Which is this super weird Schroedinger's diagnosis situation because it's like, well, if I'm not bipolar, then I really lucked out not being prescribed a mood stabilizer; if I am bipolar, then I was set back by months/years...

Having friends to have real talks about mental wellness with is really important to me, I'm sorry you're not currently sharing that with anyone in your life.

So, this is maybe kind of a hot take.

But I think behavior like this can actually be interpreted as ableist. I don't think that means the people doing it are ""bad"" (there are no toxic people only toxic behaviors). But it certainly *perpetuates oppression* by not resolving or improving the relationship between two people; one of whom has a *literal social disability*. People with ASD are fully capable of empathy and emotional labor; what we have trouble with is knowing when/why to do those things, and NTs actually have a much easier time communicating these things than we do. At a certain point it becomes everyone's responsibility to teach others how we want to be treated, and if someone is unwilling to do that work with a specific individual because of neurodivergence, they need to take responsibility for that; and also recognize that it is possibly an ableist double standard.

Like. If someone was physically blind, yeah, you don't *have to* describe something that you can see and they can't. But man, you're kind of a dick if you don't. And if you were hanging out with your blind friend you wouldn't get exasperated and say ""holy shit dude I'm so sick of describing visual things to you why can't you just fucking look at shit yourself for once."" EDIT: The difference is that everyone is socialized to know what blindness is and to accept blind people (and many other disabilities). That hasn't happened for neurodivergence yet (and many other invisible illnesses).

In this context, you ""aren't guaranteed an explanation"" in the same way that ""people of color aren't guaranteed to get hired at the same rate as white people"" or ""women aren't guaranteed to get paid as much as men."" Just because someone isn't willing to explain something to you doesn't mean you actually did anything wrong, and also doesn't mean you aren't experiencing structural oppression as a result of your identity.

To an NT, when they say ""you know what you did"" and an ND person says ""I really don't,"" they interpret that as: you're an NT person being a sass. It's really frustrating. A lot of ND symptoms end up looking like an NT person being a dick. They actually come from a totally different place, but NTs have been socialized to hate anyone different their whole lives. Both sides just need more compassion."

So, I'm not necessarily arguing with any of your larger points -- I certainly want to see fewer gun deaths and generally a much lower rate of firearm ownership -- but I hear this a lot and I'm like, is the firearms industry actually that big? I know the NRA/Republicans have this whole unholy alliance thing going on, but I always figured that was about activating the conservative voter base, rather than because the firearms industry is so huge and influential that it's able to influence the government. People are certainly making money, but the majority of that is on defense contracts where civilian gun ownership wouldn't effect profitability whether it's illegal or not.

Industries like tech, music and film are so much massively huger than firearms, all of them orders of magnitude more profitable. And no one accuses record labels of operating government conspiracy theories.

Personally, I think it makes more sense to come at the whole issue from the other angle and address causes of violence (systemic economic inequality, racial and class discrimination, gang shit, overpolicing, etc) rather than limiting legal access to firearms for civilians."

He was, indeed, an early expert on what we now call ASD, and some people will argue that he did important work in saving *some* neurodivergent people (which is true, higher-ranking Nazis just wanted to kill everyone who was autistic and Asperger was able to convince them to make some exceptions for his ""idiot savants"").

ptsd,fq56cof,t1_fq4csrw,1589093961.0,"Nah, this is a really useful comment. Thank you for your time.

Honestly we have almost the exact same story except you found a therapist that worked for you, so that's awesome. I had a similar shall we say ""mysterious"" breakup with someone that I cared about very much, and while my symptoms aren't as bad as they were a year ago, they're nowhere near what I would like. And like. Returning to work doesn't seem like an option.

I had about 15 different therapists in 2019 for various reasons. I'm unemployed due to mental illness and on medicaid, and none of these therapists actually had any experience with trauma; they just wanted to talk with me about anxiety and depression and didn't seem to know much about managing PTSD symptoms. I've tried to many different ways to find an EMDR or other trauma specialist therapist, but none of them will take medicaid and if I pay out of pocket I'll lose my insurance (which I need for like, physical health stuff too).

I feel like I've been compassionately self critical this whole time, and super open and honest with all of my therapists, but nothing about my symptoms ever improves. I eat a healthy diet and exercise a lot, make sure to spend time with friends/family but not so much that I burn myself out. I don't really know what else to do at this point, so I just read books about this stuff.

I hear what you're saying about the black and white thinking and I've been trying to check myself on that for a long time. But all of the stuff you're talking about about managing triggers is like the stuff I would LOVE to be talking with a therapist about and have yet to find. How do you tell the difference between a ""false alarm"" and a ""true alarm""? For context I feel like I spent most of 2019 in one long panic attack (like, I guess that's not really a ""thing"" but that's what it felt like)."

aspergers,fq3rh88,t1_fq3ored,1589069348.0,"Ah yeah, that's pretty classic NT ignorance about ADHD. I (and my parents/teachers) thought I didn't have ADHD for years because of the same reason; I can easily hyperfocus on video games, or as you mention, tests, or other things, especially when there's no sensory distractions (like, in school I did better on tests than the rest of in-class time, because that was the only time when everyone else stopped talking and I could actually think). Also, it's very easy for me to focus on a test where there's a preset ending time, a teacher watching me, and I am actually not allowed to leave. It's very difficult for me to focus on homework when I'm at home alone and unsupervised and could actually go do anything else at any time.

Basically NTs get lots of priorities, and they can put them in whatever order they want. ADHD brains get one priority at a time, and if it changes to anything else, that's just the priority now. To me, this is perhaps the main the defining feature of ADHD. So when you get into a situation where you can't leave until you finish X thing; of course ADHD people flare into action in a situation like that. On the other hand, if you have a long, open-ended, self-directed project, it's hard to even picture each individual step because of prioritization issues.

Attention ""Deficit and Hyperactivity"" Disorder is a really poor, I would argue actually ableist name for what is more properly termed Attention & Emotional Regulation Disorder. I've never been very externally hyperactive and I often enter quiet, contemplative states of hyperfocus. These are actual, documented symptoms of ADHD and co-occurring rejection sensitivity dysphoria, but psychiatrists are not trained to look for them. Psychiatrists usually train in general mental health knowledge rather than diving deep into specific Dx, and while I have a lot of respect for them, I rarely encounter psychiatrists who are as well informed about ADHD as I am. It is still a relatively rare condition compared to things like depression, anxiety, and PTSD.

The closest I ever get to hyperactivity is I lose control of my emotions when I reach points of high anxiety. Basically the diagnostics for ADHD are designed to detect highly stressed out/burnt out white, male, middle class ADHD children. Everyone else (and even a lot of those kids who don't present stereotypical symptoms) slips through the cracks because you don't match the somewhat ignorant stereotype the diagnostic guidelines were calibrated to. What you're encountering is likely an example of the medical practice lagging behind medical research. They *will* try to use it to deny you ADHD medication that works. Good luck."

It's interesting for me to talk to friends who have JUST one or the other about how their experiences match or clash mine.

Everything is based on appearances and associations to them, rather than reality. Your big picture thinking is why you think of these things in an actually organized fashion. NTs clean kitchens as a response to childhood trauma or nostalgia; they need to make their kitchen an idealized version of their childhood kitchen. They have a vision of what the kitchen should look like and stop working when it meets that vision (this is where your kitchen is clean enough to socially signal to other NTs that you ""have your shit together"").

My current NT psychiatrist is like, fine. But he thinks I am getting a lot out of our meetings, and all I can see myself getting out of our meetings is adderall."

Meditation is about getting all that shit out of the way and not thinking. Imagine your brain is a deep well full of water, and the water is raised even higher by large rocks placed in it. Every hour you meditate removes a tiny sip of water. How many thousands of hours is it going to take to drain all that water? But you don't lower the water level by adding more big rocks, that just makes it flood and sets you back. You lower the water level faster by reaching in and removing the rocks that are already there.

""Dude you know you've been busy lately, you were here the whole time"" 

""But dude, this isn't a 'lately' problem, this always happens!"" &c &c

Putting that together + learning more about ADHD + tbh irl getting on meds = I keep my room clean to proactively avoid internal arguments with myself. It's not easy, but it is worth it, and the functionality builds on itself.

One thing that helped me was the doing the dishes/sweeping the floor metaphor. I can't even remember where I picked it up, but it's basically ""there are only two kinds of chores: sweeping the floor, and doing the dishes. Doing the dishes turns into more work as you let them pile up, but sweeping the floor is always the exact same amount of work.""

SleepApnea,fpjbpmb,t1_fpj86bv,1588662805.0,">That can be caused by not being used to the mask, or by the mask not being comfortable. Consider if your mask is actually comfortable. Ideally I should be able to forget it's there after a couple of minutes, and when I wake, not only should it still be on, but it should take me a moment to realize I'm wearing it.

Neither of the masks I've worn were exactly uncomfortable, but I find it hard to believe I could ever find a mask as comfortable as you're describing. I started out with what they called their ""least intrusive"" mask, which was one of the nasal-only ones. Then they switched me over to a full face mask which is generally a lot better but still causing a lot of problems. The mask I have now, they said was good for people who toss and turn a lot and very secure/hard to get off accidentally. 

Should I just be trying different styles within those two types? I guess I should stick to full face masks because I've been finding that more pleasant, but what should I be looking for? It's hard for me to ""consider what my issue"" is here with the mask because both styles were pretty unpleasant. I guess I'll try to think about the differences.

>Do you have this sensory disorder when you're awake?

Oh yeah, I'm autistic. I mentioned that to every doctor etc every step of the way...

My machine isn't very loud, but due to sensory problems literally any noise at all is enough to keep me from getting to sleep. I wish I was exaggerating but after all this time I have come to accept that those are just ""the rules."" I have a white noise machine running closer to my bed than the APAP machine, so for the most part I don't hear it; but when I exhale, it vibrates and makes a slightly different noise, and that slightly different noise is apparently just different enough from the background that it causes problems. Mouse pads for the vibration is a great suggestion though, thank you. I'm not sure if I have any at the moment, so I might just try some towels for tonight.

>You harp on your sensitivity to sound and light, and also on insomnia. All of these could be side effects of not getting good sleep (and thus not being able to be deeply asleep) due to sleep apnea.

It's true that all of these things are certainly exacerbated by sleep apnea, but like I'm definitely always going to be super sensitive to sound, light, smell & movement to the point where I can't really share a bed with another person.

>You were getting . It wasn't ""solid"" or you wouldn't need the apap.

True, this is a good point, but what I meant to say is I was easily falling asleep at midnight and waking up feeling well rested 8 hours later, without an alarm clock, every single night for a long time. APAP machine coming into my life put a stop to that, threw my sleep schedule for a LOOP, and I haven't been feeling super well rested since. Frustratingly, my breathing feels better and general level of congestion has gone down, which I think is due to the machine.

>You feel like there's not enough air, like you're out of breath, trying to haul air in and out of your lungs to get enough oxygen, or

Yes.

>There's plenty of air but you can't exhale, or

Yes.

>There isn't enough room around your mouth and nose for there to be enough air for you to breathe?

Yes. Not trying to be flippant here or anything, but I definitely have all of those problems you described, and I appreciate your specificity. This is exactly the kind of info I was hoping to get by posting here 🤩

I still honestly don't totally understand what the RAMP function does. Temporarily lowers the pressure? When I talked with my sleep doctor about all these issues he lowered the pressure on machine slightly, but I haven't found that to make that much of a difference either way.

I have a Philips machine, I guess I'll try to call the sleep center and figure out the A-flex thing tomorrow.

>What is ""frequently enough to be sanitary""?

Okay so I think this is an ASD thing. I take things very literally and miss basically all subtext. What the person at the sleep center was trying to tell me was ""your insurance won't cover enough of these, so you have to buy more of these filters yourself."" But what she said was ""your insurance won't cover enough of these."" and just kinda left it on that, so I heard ""and so you're fucked"" because I have bad anxiety and a tendency which you may have noticed to catastrophize. I'm on medicaid and they've given me trouble before for trying to pay for certain services/supplies out of pocket before, so I was too stressed out to ask for clarification.

They said I needed to change the filters I believe 2x a month and clean the non-disposable filters once a month. I think. I have it written down somewhere. My insurance will cover replacing half of those. But I should be fine just buying those dudes online.

>You will if you give up.

I've already been at this for three years and arguing with 6+ doctors who refused to refer me to sleep studies for reasons I still don't totally understand, I'm not worried about me personally giving up. What I am worried about is my APAP machine fucking up my sleep schedule (already happened) and then getting taken away because my compliance isn't high enough, and then I'll be back where I started. I believe you intended for this comment to be empowering/encouraging though, and I appreciate it on that level.

>Please see above comments about renting a machine.

I'm disabled/unemployed, I can't really afford to buy one of these myself. If I pass compliance for I believe a month they'll buy it for me, it's basically rent-to-own until then. Honestly it's a pretty fair deal, if the machine works -- I just can't keep the thing on my face all night, and at this point I'm worried I don't have enough time left in the trial to switch around masks, build tolerance, and meet compliance.

The fucked up part with my parents is they're these crazy hippie activist types who will openly flaunt ""society's rules"" in all these ways.

Ultimately, what I realized was that my parents reacted strongly against their shitty upbringings; but it was from a place of a mistreated child's narcissism and they never actually brought it back around into healing the trauma. They just resolved to uncritically be ""the opposite"" of their parents in every way (even the things their parents did right!). Just as one example, my ma would basically use feminism as an excuse to cut out from being emotionally supportive, but then also accuse my dad and I of being sexist if we started getting too buddy buddy.

Now I live my parents *stated* values of freedom, independent thinking, and respect for life, while avoiding their actual behaviors as much as possible.

Yep! It's funny, actually, because my parents were so obsessed with etiquette and things like that, I was basically intentionally an asshole to everyone when I was a teenager. Predictably ended up falling in with the punk crowd, because I was like ""oh yeah, these guys don't give a fuck about *any* rules!"" But it was actually from those people that I learned about *real* human kindness and mutual respect; how to listen & be heard without hurting each others feelings, how to build a person up and respect them even when you're disagreeing with parts of what they're doing or saying; you know, like *actual fucking manners that let you maintain and grow friendships* like my asshole parents couldn't believe."

Also, as a reality check, while childbirth is always going to be difficult and intense, if ""not having food at one point"" (or rather, the narcissistic injury of your partner eating your food) was the *worst thing that happened,* your mom got pretty lucky. Like, people die or are seriously hurt all the time.

Something I run into sometimes is this idea that ""I grew up a lot when I realized my parents weren't perfect, but they TRIED!"" and as my old therapist said; this can ring hollow for a lot of people, because a lot of us aren't unreasonably bitter, we just actually had parents who didn't fucking try."

Because that's *always* where my mind goes. When I see kids acting up, a little part of me is always smiling, even if other people around me are annoyed by them.

My parents sound pretty similar to yours. One thing I realized is that their conception of manners is mostly about setting up scenarios so they can knock people down while feeling ""right."" Their ""manners"" were all about them regulating other people's behavior by basically mimicking politeness in a very passive aggressive way, without actually being kind. True manners are about making other people feel comfortable and respected, and it's taken me a long time to figure this out. ""Manners"" are a very basic empathy thing, where we try to have a set of rules generally known in society so that two humans who don't know each other well can make themselves feel a bit more comfortable together. Turning that into a complex series of conversational rules, that can be used to justify unkindness, without any empathy at all... is some twisted shit.

One little thing that made me realize this. My parents are HARD about all kinds of etiquette. But they never say ""bless you"" or anything like that when anyone sneezes (me hypothesis: there's no way to tactically turn that into emotional abuse, so they see no reason to do it). I had a foreign language teacher my freshman year in college, who as sort of an immersion-joke would make everyone say ""bless you!"" in the language we were studying whenever anyone in class sneezed; and from there I somehow got in the habit of saying ""bless you!"" whenever anyone sneezes around me. It's not a big deal, but it is a little polite, I dunno, I like it when people do it to me. Anyway, move back in with my parents, at some point my ma sneezes, I say ""bless you!"" and no one looked at me or said anything.

It was like a bomb went off in my head. Despite their commitment to ""the Rules of Etiquette"" and like, giving me shit for saying ""thanks"" rather than ""thank you very much."" *These people are actually rude as fuck*. They just use ""manners"" as legalistic social/emotional manipulation strategy, and so they can feel better about themselves whenever anyone rejects them (""You were being so crazy, I was the one being calm and polite!!"")."
neurodiversity,fpi6b4u,t1_fphfvx5,1588634526.0,"Nah. Grief is for when someone dies. What's needed here is an acceptance process.

Does your child have cancer, or need risky surgery? No, by all accounts she has similar odds to living a long and happy life as most folks, she just has an alternative approach to problem solving which is being more accepted in mainstream culture every day.

Being autistic isn't bad, so why would you grieve? Neurodivergence has potential to make your child's life harder, and you both need to accept that. But the difficulty is what should make you sad, not the diagnosis. I am sad about the challenges I've faced in my life, but it's unrealistic to think about what ""my life could have been like"" if I wasn't autistic, because I would have just been a completely different person facing a completely different set of challenges. I am not sad about being autistic, that would be like being sad about the color of my eyes.

In addition, as someone raised undiagnosed by NTs; the thought of a self-aware ND parent raising a ND kid gives me a lot of hope for that kid's future. Think of all the things that you will be able to share, that you might not if your kid was NT! Think of having to explain/contextualize some of your behavior/symptoms to a NT child...

A NT parent who engages in a ""grieving process"" after learning their child is autistic is being (most likely unintentionally) ableist, because autistic life is not a tragedy. That's really all there is to it."
