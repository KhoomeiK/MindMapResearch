pcgamingtechsupport,fp4te9t,t1_fp48svb,1588306910.0,I'm thinking the same thing. Thanks!
pcgamingtechsupport,fo8pld9,t1_fo8dsbr,1587601247.0,"Okay thanks for the advice. I'm currently running in 1440p on 144hrz monitor. Seems like most frames ingrt in what I'm playing is around 100, which is fine, but wondering why it's not static and continue to fluctuate. I wasn't sure if that was normal or not. Thanks!"
suggestapc,fnk09lc,t1_fnjxsp9,1587011342.0,"I actually have a powerspec pc right now. It has an i5-7500 and GTX 1060 6gb, and i've never had issues with mine either, but i feel like its time to upgrade.

Thanks for the reply!"
buildapc,fngaj8d,t1_fng8b5z,1586926524.0,"Yeah the price different isnt' too different. The i-7 is roughly $80 more. 

I just really want something I can A. play 1440p, or b. play 1080 and stream as well.

Seems like Ryzen is the way to go."
buildapc,fngagzc,t1_fng86p7,1586926474.0,It seems like that's the consensus across the board on many of the posts i've looked at. Thanks!
HealthAnxiety,fmz1y95,t1_fmz1h5h,1586503339.0,I totally understand where you're coming from! Some years I would only get a few and then other years i would get one a month. Last week I actually got two in the same day. That is from all the stress from quarantine. And there have been many times where I don't get a headache after. It just varies. But yes when you get one ask yourself what could've triggered it in the moment. Best of luck! Stay safe :)
HealthAnxiety,fmz1a87,t3_fy85js,1586502655.0,"I get these as well. Got my first one when I was in high school, I'm 33 now, and my eye doctor told me that I was one of the ""lucky"" ones because it's a warning sign of an incoming migraine. I hate the zig zag lines though. Makes me sick sometimes because their so powerful. Ill get them either once a month or once every few months. Some things that trigger them are florescent lights, and going from a dark room into a well lot room. I will usually take migraine over the counter meds and/or chug a Mt. Dew and the headache isn't too bad. Keep your head up!"
buildapc,fmxfx8t,t1_fmxdndy,1586464243.0,Seriously thank you for all the help! Looks like i'll be doing this within the next week or so. Stoked to upgrade my rig!
buildapc,fmxcn29,t1_fmxbad9,1586462518.0,Okay good to know. Do you have one specifically? I may go ahead and just grab that too then. At this point i'm building an entirely new PC HA!
buildapc,fmxa2wz,t1_fmnzokp,1586461206.0,Sorry it took so long for me to get back. Looks like I have an FSP Power Supply. It's the FSP Model No FSP500-50AGBCD. Hopefully this info is what you're looking for.
buildapc,fmnzlj7,t1_fmnzclw,1586240161.0,It's a mid-tower. I'll have to check my PSU and wattage tomorrow. I'll get brands as well. I'll get that info in the morning. Thanks again!
buildapc,fmnz6ir,t1_fmnyse4,1586239766.0,"Awesome! Thanks so much for the help. This really means a lot! ONE final question. It should be pretty easy to replace motherboard, cpu and gpu correct? Just a matter of plugging everything in?"
buildapc,fmny22e,t1_fmnxt0z,1586238730.0,Okay this is all starting to make sense! So what processor would you go with? Let's say i'm buying the 2070 Super. Would I need to buy a new motherboard for a better processor?
buildapc,fmnxva6,t1_fmnwzi4,1586238562.0,"The other thing, let's say I decide to upgrade my current pc. What CPU can I upgrade to with my current motherboard? I'd like to go with an I-7 theoretically."
buildapc,fmnwzi4,t1_fmnvd7g,1586237781.0,"Thanks for your help.

Here's what I'm working with currently.

GTX 1060 6GB

I5-7500 CPU 3.4ghz

16gig of Ram

Current Motherboard is b250 PC MATE (ms-7a72)

&#x200B;

At this point I either want to upgrade this rig, or buy a completely new one and use this one for streaming. I've seen people talk pretty highly of RYZEN lately as well, so thought about going with them this go around. But honestly If I could just upgrade this unit then it would be less work for me. One of the big questions I have is; if I buy a GTX 2070 Super is running with my i5-7500 good enough? Or would I need to upgrade both? That's what I don't really understand."
gamingsuggestions,fmnqstk,t3_fwd5z6,1586232730.0,There's a game on Steam called Flashing Lights. I've never played it but the reviews are Overall Positive. Maybe something to check out.
HealthAnxiety,fmnnlrd,t3_fwce0d,1586230354.0,I've been having the same issues for the past two weeks. Since the beginning of all this I've noticed fluctuations in body temp like crazy. Wake up in the morning to 97.5 and 99.0 around 6-10 pm. Was definitely concerned but seems to be just allergies and anxiety.
buildapc,fmmr2y9,t1_fmltsvs,1586210455.0,Yeah I thought about grabbing a gsync monitor and a graphics card but was worried with the i-5 I'd still be in the same boat. With that said though I wasn't entirely sure how it all works so I could be completely wrong. Budget right now is around $1000.
buildapc,fmlrpyi,t1_fmki1nk,1586192001.0,Yeah it seems like If I'm going to spend the cash to get the next gen of cards. I wasn't sure if I should get a new CPU or not.
buildapc,fmlrmms,t1_fmkm2rr,1586191952.0,"For the most part it does. Im really thinking about the end of the year, mainly Cyberpunk 2077. I want to run that at 60fps. Not sure my current setup can do that, plus I have some extra money coming in so I wanted to spend that on new pc parts.  Honestly, I stream a bit so I thought about buying a new pc completely and using my current setup for a streaming machine. 

Also, I currently run 16 GB or RAM.  I bought a BenQ Monitor last year and like it okay. Wouldn't mind getting something a little more special, maybe one with g-sync. 

Matt"
buildapc,fmlrci3,t1_fmknnf0,1586191803.0,I didn't realize there was a super version of the card. That would be the one I would go with then. Thanks for the heads up. I'll look at that one.
buildapc,fmkf2h5,t1_fmkeis6,1586152809.0,For sure. I have a buddy with it and he swears by it. Just trying to figure out if I'm going to spend several hundred bucks what the best route would be. Thanks!
buildapc,fmkedqt,t1_fmke3bt,1586152172.0,Through research I noticed the 1080ti is still preforming pretty well. I wasn't sure if that would future proof me or not for at least 5 years or so. I'll definitely look into it. Thanks!
buildapc,fmke3b4,t1_fmke0jt,1586151913.0,Okay. Do you have a recommendation on a card? Which 2070 would you go with? Thanks!
buildapc,fm8t7v7,t1_fm8sstd,1585855578.0,Sweet! Thank you!
buildapc,fm8si12,t1_fm8sf7m,1585855192.0,"Okay good to know, thanks!"
buildapc,fm8sggj,t1_fm8s41k,1585855169.0,I wasn't sure if upgrading would be worth it or not. To be honest I'm trying to future proof myself a bit for when Cyberpunk comes out.
buildapc,fm8scyk,t1_fm8rzkz,1585855118.0,"Gotcha, thanks for the link. I'll check it out."
buildapc,fm8sbz0,t1_fm8s3m5,1585855103.0,I've never looked into Ryzen. I'm pretty new to the world of pc building and gaming. Does it matter if I am using Nvidia Graphics Card? Or does that have nothing to do with it?
Anxiety,flpvde8,t3_fqca0y,1585369919.0,"Thank you for the response! Right now I plan to monitor my blood pressure for another week and see where it goes and then make an appointment. My anxiety has been quite bad with this entire situation and I've noticed a lot of weird things happening so at this point just trying to get some opinions. Thanks!

Matt"
Anxiety,flfpqul,t1_flfovu0,1585113495.0,I'm doing the exact same thing. It's been pretty hard the last few days.
Anxiety,flfpn25,t1_flff8vp,1585113399.0,I've been doing the exact same thing! I've been feeling really hot. My cheeks are blushed and my eyes feel a bit hot. I check my tempature about four/five times an hour and it's always the same. 98.8. it hit 99.0 at one point but that's it. It's stressing me out so badly.
Anxiety,flfnzai,t3_fo6h6w,1585111910.0,"Wow this post really hits home for me. I actually logged onto reddit/anxiety to see if anyone else was talking about this. For me reading all your answers is helping to calm me. 

I've been battling a tightness in my chest with some challenging breathing moments. I've been constantly taking my tempature. I feel blushed and hot a lot the last week or so. Does anyone expert this? When I take my tempature it usually reads 98.8. It has hit 99.0 a few times but from what I understand that really isn't a tempature. 

It's crazy the things my brain makes me believe. 

Blessing friends. Matt"

Anxiety,flez6y2,t1_flcmz64,1585094534.0,I didn't realize until just recently that shortness of breathe is pretty prevalent with anxiety. I had no idea! I've been dealing with that a bit over the last few days. Keep up the good fight!
Anxiety,flez4gt,t1_flckwe2,1585094493.0,"Thank you Emily! I've noticed to have a bit of breathing issues as well.  And since that is one of the symptoms of Covid, it's got me freaked out! Thanks for the reply. Take care of yourself."
Anxiety,fleyzoe,t1_flckgee,1585094413.0,"I've had a few friends talk about their physical symptoms a lot, but I've never really dealt with the physical side before. I find myself being a really bad hypochondriac, and this pandemic is really starting to bring out the worst in that.  I'm constantly thinking I have Covid-19. It's awful. Thanks for the reply!"

letsplay,fefqvnf,t1_fee5z7q,1579062598.0,"For sure, makes sense. I'm going to stream on Twitch. Not only is it better quality, but I think discoverability for streams is a little better than YouTube. Thanks for the reply! Ill check out the channel"
buildapc,fecomb3,t1_feceyf8,1578979245.0,"1080p. That's all I really want at this point. I guess it would be nice to go a step above that, but it's not really needed for me at this point."
letsplay,fdpbjom,t1_fdlfpl6,1578624520.0,"I think it all comes down to the games. Be a variety streamer! Seriously, don't limit yourself. Enjoy it all! That's what I try to do :)"
letsplay,fdpbhja,t3_elzf5h,1578624478.0,"I was in a similar situation. I had started a channel based on Pokemon content, and it grew fairly quickly. We hit around 300 subs within a few months, and it was awesome! However, I decided that I wanted to start a second channel for my gaming. Obviously, it hasn't grown nearly at all in comparison to my other page. So be ready for slow growth. Not saying it can't be done by any means, but having people going from one channel of yours to another, unless your a major You Tuber, will be slow. 

To answer your question. It really depends on what type of content creator you want to be. I've heard and read stories of folks playing one game for a year and growing within that community and then switching to other games and their fine, I've also heard of that not working. I've also seen people like Coohcarnage be a variety streamer/youtuber and be crazy successful with it. I don't think you need to set boundaries for yourself. Play what you want on what you want. If you think playing one game will make you more successful then go for it! best of luck to you!!"
letsplay,fdpaued,t3_em6rf7,1578624041.0,"I've been considering doing this as well. It seems like killing two birds with one stone makes a lot of sense. My worry is that the quality of the video will suffer if i'm taking it directly from Twitch to YouTube, but with that said, I've noticed all the big streamers are doing it now and their videos turn out just fine. I'll use Coohcarnage as an example. His videos on YouTube aren't perfect, but it does capture everything that needs to be captured and people can watch his videos without missing any story. Back to your question, I think what you are considering is super viable! Looking forward to the content, and you'll have to keep us updated with how it all turns out!"
letsplay,fdp8t3v,t1_fdogyt8,1578622685.0,"I love the idea of Gateway content. I'm sort of doing that now with the occasional ""produced"" video. But yeah trailer reactions, or recent game pick-ups are some things I've thought about as well.  I agree with everything you said! Thanks for the reply, also I checked out your channel and I loved the professional appearance of everything!"
letsplay,fdp821y,t1_fdo3irz,1578622178.0,"Yeah I agree. I can get super bored with a game if I have no interest in the story. But definitely finding a niche within what your interested in is super important.

PS LOVE MASS EFFECT!"
letsplay,fdp7yz2,t1_fdmznzw,1578622120.0,I've been seriously thinking about going all retro/switch indie. I think that it's niche enough with a dedicated fan base to justify giving it a shot. And there are way too many let's plays of older games.
letsplay,fdp7v3f,t1_fdmycml,1578622048.0,"I completely agree. I've seen so many let's plays that are monotone, or boring, and it really brings down the mood. Having a good time without being overly enthusiastic is key."
letsplay,fdp7rz2,t1_fdmt0vv,1578621988.0,"That's a very valid point about the promotion side of things. It's true, known YouTubers will have an advantage no matter what when it comes to new titles and that can make a huge difference moving forward. Definitely something to think about."
letsplay,fdou67d,t1_fdmrkye,1578612952.0,"Yeah I agree, that's why in many ways I've thought about focusing content on Nintendo Switch Indie games. I think there's a pretty good market there."
letsplay,fdou3x3,t1_fdmq3uz,1578612911.0,I really like that. It's about adding another dynamic to the videos. Thanks for the advice!
letsplay,fdou1g7,t1_fdng08c,1578612865.0,Thanks man!
letsplay,fdmjpqo,t1_fdm8pxs,1578552419.0,"Okay, gotcha. Yeah when it comes to Kingdom Hearts and the community i'm pretty lost."
letsplay,fdmjosx,t1_fdmhgs4,1578552389.0,"I wouldn't personally consider them old, but it seems with the shelf life of gaming on YouTube and twitch, unless your playing retro, the games are old. But I agree, definitely need to make things interesting!"
letsplay,fdm88n2,t1_fdm79wa,1578542238.0,"Oh yeah for sure! I'll get to them eventually. A few close friends love it, of course, even they say the community is crazy (in a good way)."

letsplay,fdm5pod,t1_fdlwpr3,1578540434.0,"Ha! It's weird looking back and thinking...""these days 2012 is old"". Yeah entertainment could be the make or break factor streaming and playing older games. Personality is a key thing as well. I think it all comes back to enjoying what i'm doing. Thanks!"
letsplay,fdm5kz1,t1_fdlrri2,1578540342.0,"Yeah I completely agree with everything you said. I've felt like it may be a handicap doing older games, and as u/RelleMeetsWorld mentioned above, finding tight nit communities within the archetype of certain games makes a lot of sense. I just need to find the niche, and the games I enjoy playing and want to share with other people. Thanks for the response!"
letsplay,fdm5e1g,t1_fdlqcqc,1578540207.0,"Great advice! Yeah that makes sense about what you said in terms of communities. That is definitely something to consider when picking a game to Lets Play. I actually follow several communities on YouTube for specific games so I'm not sure why I never thought of that. It's definitely something I will think about going forward. The only idea I've had up to this point that could be classified in the same vain is doing retro gaming. It seems there's a pretty big community on YouTube for that with passionate people.  Good luck with Kingdom Hearts, that's a series I never got in to ."
letsplay,fdm55mb,t1_fdlwp0w,1578540045.0,I will definitely check it out. I've never used Reddit until today so I'm still discovering everything.
letsplay,fdlo0m1,t1_fdli1ca,1578528386.0,"Yeah, wow that's crazy! I've thought about doing that myself. I considered playing through a game as quick as I can and getting it uploaded, but you have some good advice. It's also nice to hear from someone who's tried that. Thanks for the reply! Definitely something for me to think about."
letsplay,fdlnqyi,t1_fdlg8e3,1578528204.0,"Definitely man, it's truly about the fun. Sometimes I think about how crazy it is I can play a game now and stream it to the world or make a video on it. It feels like yesterday I was playing the Dreamcast in a room by myself haha. Sweet man I'll send you a sub!"
letsplay,fdlf1zz,t1_fdle0fw,1578522633.0,"Yeah man, honestly I think a lot of it is dependent on some luck, at least to a certain degree. My favorite Let's Play channel is RadBRad. His videos are simple, but he plays all the new stuff. He just hit 11 million followers so naturally a lot of people are going to him first for games. With that said, building hype for older games like the Bioshock Collection can be tough. That's what Im currently dealing with, but who knows maybe one day we will both see a surge in viewership. Good luck man! Also, can you link me your channel? Thanks!"
letsplay,fdleqif,t1_fdldcyr,1578522441.0,"That makes complete sense. Having FUN is the main attraction to gaming, at least for me. So hopefully that will come off in the videos. It's tough getting over that mindset of ""man it sucks no one is watching my videos"" mentality when recording. I'm sure it will just take time! Thanks for the response."
letsplay,fdlekje,t1_fdld8mm,1578522342.0,Very true! Finding that niche will be the hardest part no doubt. I told myself at the start of the year that I at least wanted to make one produced video a week with let's play thrown in. If I can stick with that for a few months I'm sure ideas for finding a niche will come. Thanks!!
letsplay,fdlee5k,t1_fdld6zs,1578522235.0,Thanks! You too!
letsplay,fdledfd,t1_fdlcyvq,1578522223.0,"Oh no. At this point i'm just going to do what everyone else does and play all the major games with older games thrown in. I'm too much a variety gamer to stick to one thing, I think I would go crazy!"
letsplay,fdlcbgb,t1_fdlbf0v,1578520978.0,I like that. Pick a specific day and put out or stream older games. Not a bad idea. I may try doing that then once newer hyped games start releasing.
letsplay,fdlc5r0,t1_fdlc1yg,1578520882.0,Exactly!
letsplay,fdlapoq,t1_fdla7vb,1578520020.0,"Yeah I'm thinking the same thing. My current plan is to play and post ""older"" games on the channel and then when a new release hits do a let's play of those. That will help keep a good mix of things."
letsplay,fdlalkz,t1_fdl9hee,1578519953.0,I think the hardest part of it all is that since the game(s) have been out for so long now there's already several episodes on YouTube. Finding a niche could be key! Good luck man.
