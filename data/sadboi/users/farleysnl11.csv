Takes time to train out that negative self talk, it’s not easy. You have to cut a new path, and you will. You finished you statement with love, and that’s how I know you will be able to love yourself, and in doing so silence the doubt in your mind. You validate you. It’s nice to have friendo and family yet you don’t get to pick however they react in their mind.

Also. Fuck em, you know you are a loving wonderful divine person, clearly good hearted. Anyone who wants to do anything other than encourage and support you can go fuck themselves lol

BPD,fr52phs,t3_gmq411,1589901442.0,"Look how far you have come. Well done.

To overcome your reactions and taking things personally you have to understand that you do not get to make decisions for others, you get to make decisions for yourself. Learn to accept that other people are often not even thinking of you when they do things, and that the true power you have is the ability to chose how you respond.

As you learn to control your reactions I want you to do this for me. I want you to consistently remind yourself that you deserve love and compassion and understanding, especially towards yourself. I know it sounds silly but once you truly accept that you are a wonderful divine being, you will stop letting unawakened people yo have control over YOUR emotional state of mind. The single best thing you can do is love yourself enough to not let the actions and opinions of others effect how you feel about yourself. Now I’m not saying be emotionless.... it’s good to feel a range of emotions, sometimes people make us happy sometimes sad, but truly remember that you are your best friend and work on not over analyzing others. You are deserving of feeling good. And when you catch yourself over analyzing remind yourself that you are in control, accept that some people just are lame, and that you deserve love compassion and happiness"

The human race is a race of cowards; and I am not only marching in that procession but carrying a banner.
