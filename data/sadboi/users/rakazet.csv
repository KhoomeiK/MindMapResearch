scifi,fqd89n1,t1_fqd7olk,1589283014.0,"No problem man, I was just curious because my friends who love anime don't really enjoy this, they prefer other anime trends like I mentioned. The remake isn't finished but you can always watch the original, they're the same story, with minor differences. That's what I did because I also can't stand waiting. If you can stand old animations then good for you because there's a reason why the original is dubbed the best anime of all time. Try watching the remake first, and if you enjoy it switch to the original from episode 1 because the pace is different. Still, family comes first. I wish you and your family stay healthy and safe!"

scifi,fq0r21c,t1_fq0q5re,1589036394.0,"Alright, have fun watching. Season 1 and 2 is just a warmup, you should know how the rest of the series will go by the time you finish Season 2. Season 3 should be released by the end of the year if the virus thing stops."

scifi,fq0ej11,t1_fpzwsk3,1589030723.0,"oof. They're good as in their intentions. One wants to rule with an iron fist, with the people having freedom. Imagine a dictatorship where people have free speech, equality, etc. The other guy just wants to keep democracy because he believes that no matter how good the current dictator is it will eventually fall in the wrong hands. None of them are malevolent in their intentions, yet they're killing each other."
scifi,fpzfdo7,t1_fpzcltx,1589017536.0,"Actually the story is exactly the same, and surprisingly the remake is more faithful to the novels, few minor changes that are better than the original. I don't know the exact reason they remade this, but LOGH is a cult classic and Production IG probably thinks it's a good idea to remake the show. Since you haven't finished the original I think you should watch the remake to relive the series (*spoiler for others* They've only reached Season 2 where that guy dies because of laser ring lol) and then continue the original where you left off. The ending is very emotional."
logh,fpz0r26,t1_fpz01g1,1589011394.0,And yes I just finished AOT and realized the song is so fitting for LOGH lul
logh,fpz0n9m,t1_fpz01g1,1589011351.0,"Of course I prefer the old character designs too especially Reinhard's, but some are actually better like Oberstein and Merkatz. Also the animations are SICK, the old ones were just so bad. Consider this an adaptation to the novel instead of an OVA remake because the story is more faithful to the novel which imo makes it better than the original."
scifi,fpz02ce,t1_fpyylei,1589011143.0,"Yes it is, I think it's fitting because the song is about dedication to the nation. It's kinda ironic when you know the story."
scifi,fpyhp0z,t1_fpyg6z8,1589004069.0,"Yes, far more serious. I enjoyed Yamato, but you don't feel the intensity because everyone has plot armor. This anime covers politics and philosophy really well. Is a bad democracy better or worse than the best autocracy? Should we be at war with a dictatorship or seek peace with them? These questions are covered in the show but you're the one who decides the answer. Also you'll be attached to people from both sides, good people killing each other only because they disagree politically. They start questioning whether it is worth it for millions of people to die just because they can't agree on how to rule a nation. Season 1 and 2 is just a warm up on what's coming next, though by the end of Season 2 you'll understand that this is just the beginning. Season 3 and on is the real deal. I can send you the links to watch it since the order can be a bit confusing."
