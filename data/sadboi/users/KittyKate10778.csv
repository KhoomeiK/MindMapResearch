mentalhealth,fq7zcy9,t3_gh5k0z,1589155324.0,"Idk why but this made me feel very validated. My mother wasnt abusive she loved me very much and provided everything i needed and much more than that. The only problem was i was diagnosed with mental health issues at a very young age including autism. Now as a teenager (really starting at 15 or 16) i started fighting with my mom a lot because she was overprotective and treated me like a child even as a teenager. Her excuse as to why she treated me like a child was ""you have the mental/emotional (i cant remember which) of a 14 (it may have been 12 i cant remember correctly) year old"" that fucking hurt along with the fact that a lot of my friends were getting freedoms i wasnt. Granted i was acting out but i was hurt and angry and miserable that i wasnt getting treated like a kid as an almost adult that i was constantly getting in fights with my mom over this that i was an only child who felt teamed up against in those fights because my parents believe in joint parenting because i constantly had to apologize for said fights but my mom never had to that i was constantly getting crticized by her for not owning up to shit i did but when i pointed out that she does the exact same thing her excuse was ""i do it at work all the time"" that she only apologized to me when she felt like she did something wrong and not when i said i felt hurt a lot of shit she did made me miserable and suicidal and act out cause i had no proper way to vent my feelings.  She went to church she acted nice in public and so everyone who meets her doesnt believe or finds it hard to believe this shit went on and the people i live with (i live in a group home) never say they dont believe me but theyve met my mom and i feel so ungrateful when i hear about their backgrounds and i invalidate myself. A big reason why i couldnt vent was because if i called my friend to vent about arguments i was ""telling on her"" and ""making her look bad"" they psychiatrist i saw while living with them only really heard things from my parents pov cause i didnt feel like i could be open with my parents in the session that they were still going in when i was 18. I didnt ask them not to go in cause i had spent all that mental energy on getting my mom not to go into my therapy sessions with me. 


So yes im resentful of my mom yes i look like an ungrateful bitch yes i feel like i shouldnt resent my mom cause i was a lot better off than most ppl but i still feel that way and this post was very validating"

That's why I dont like hearing it at all ppl use it to demean ppl with autism and down syndrome and to bully them and dehumanize them. PPL WITH AUTISM AND DOWNS ARE PPL TOO. Just because we learn slower or differently or we dont follow social norms doesnt mean we aren't human. It also doesnt mean we are less than either. I personally abhor the r word because the only context where it's not used in a derogatory manner is when you are talking about the outdated (imo idk if it actually is) medical term.

AskReddit,fplztmd,t3_gdzb3i,1588722681.0,"Twi that idk if they really count.

First one I was in a summer daycare where I was like 7, there were a lot of issues with that daycare including the fact I fidget with my hands I always have and once I did so in such a way that I put my middle finger up. At this point in my life my parents had never explained that putting your middle finger up is bad but other kids knew. I got told on and they came back and I was like what's wrong with doing this and put my middle finger up again like a dumbass and got put in timeout. My mom wasn't happy cause I didn't even know what I was doing. 


Second story is the time in senior year of high school we had a substitute in my ap chem class. Some backstory I have autism and dont deal well with change a lot of times if there was a substitute I would just go to a classroom of a teacher I got along with and did my work there. I also have a hard time with wording things sometimes what I say and what I mean are two different things. This time i stayed in the classroom and the substitute was joking around with the class and I tried to join in. He didn't like it and got up in my space. I dont like ppl I dont really know as close to me as he was, hell I had a teacher 3 years in a row who was a close talker and I was uncomfortable when I talked to him sometimes. So my response to him being in my bubble was to turn around and tell my classmate ""the next time he gets in my space I'll hit him"" now what I actually meant was I was going to push him out of my space my mouth just moved faster than my brain. I almost got in trouble for threatening assualt. However at the time I had a 504 plan (a 504 is basically a lesser form of an iep so I could get accommodations but not as many as with an iep) the person who worked with my mom on my 504 intervened and got me out of trouble once I explained that it was just me mispeaking. Idk if that counts cause I didn't really get in trouble and it was a valid reason if you had never worked with me before (which the substitute hadnt) but it was kinda stupid how it happened.

Tl;dr I agree that self diagnosing is bad to a certain extent but base don personal experience sometimes it's all that's available either financially or other ways such as being specialized and you're in an area that doesn't have a lot of specialists so sometimes it's the best you have."
teenagers,fpdmh6s,t3_gcmt4v,1588529902.0,"So I agree with this to an extent but I also think sometimes self diagnosis is the best ppl can have sometimes.  Whether it's because they dont have the financial means to get diagnosed or because it's something that not a lot if doctors recognize. Like a person said in the comments autism can be really hard to be diagnosed with. I have personally self diagnosed myself with arfid and dermatillomania tentatively. I'm living in group housing for mental health conditions that I *have* been diagnosed with, and so am on Medicaid and go to the clinic that the group housing uses. My prescriber had never heard of dermatillomania my therapist had never heard of arfid. I'm not in a place where I can get to see someone who has heard of those things, because I live in maryland and all the big cities with all the good specialists are on the opposite side of the state from where I live. I have thought I had CPTSD in the past and I'm a good example of why you shouldn't self diagnose for that reason. However for some clarification dermatillomania is a disorder related to trichotillomania where ppl compulsively pull out hair but with dermatillomania instead of hair its skin. I compulsively pick at scabs I have scars all over my arms and legs from that. ARFID is the acronym for avoidant restrictive food intake disorder which is an eating disorder where ppl restrict what they eat due to the fear of negative consequences. I ear a very limited diet due to the fact that I'm afraid to try new foods. So in my case I'm probs on the borderline with those two but I'm not in any place to get an official diagnosis at the moment as my therapist (in relation to the arfid) went through the dsm5 and said I didn't have it on the very first day he heard of it. Idk about you but I dont have much confidence in being told i dont have something by someone who has never treated the condition before and has not even heard of it till I brought it up as is just reading the criteria out of the psychiatry bible because imo stuff like that can be nuanced for example one of the things in the dsm5 is that there is usually no body dysmorphia but I have also read about ppl being diagnosed with both anorexia and arfid and anorexia does sometimes have body dysmorphia involved. So I prefer to be told whether or not I have something by someone who has treated said condition and since I dont have access to that I'm self diagnosed currently. 

Also if there's grammar poor spelling or things that look weird my phone screen is fucked up and I cant see part of what I'm typing and I have really fat thumbs that tend to hit the wrong button including autocomplete results sometimes and an autocorrect that thinks I'm wrong when I'm right"
aspergers,fo8omt0,t3_g620he,1587600700.0,Someone already made this comment and I think it should be higher. There's a new freeform show that has its first (and so far only) season on hulu. It's called everythings going to be okay. It's about an Australian man who moves to America to take care of his minor half sisters after their father dies of cancer. One of the characters has autism. The actress who portrays the character has autism. I think for this reason it made their portrayal of autism very accurate and her character felt very true to my experience. I would really recommend this show as the guy who becomes caretaker is gay the man he's in a relationship with is Latina (I think) and the character with autism dates a girl for part of the season. So lgbt representation interracial couple representation disabled lgbt ppl representation. There's a lot of diversity and representation is my point.
AskDocs,fo8nn4w,t3_g66i1v,1587600132.0,NAD but someone with a lot of major mental health issues. I read that you stopped taking your meds cause you felt better. Something that was drilled into me (even tho I didn't need it cause I have been taking psych meds that dont just treat adhd since I was 8 and adhd meds off and on since 6 or 7 so it's a part of my life at this pojt) every time I went to the psych ward or a doctor's office or a different treatment center is to NOT STOP TAKING YOUR MEDS IF YOU FEEL BETTER. Their explanation was the meds are supposed to make you feel better and maintain that feeling of wellness. Like your depression is a chemical imbalance so these meds help keep things balanced correctly so if you stop them your symptoms come back. Basically dont stop your med if you haven't talked to a doctor first. I'm not trying to make you feel.bad I swear I just wanted to let you know this information because it is important. If you feel better that's a sign the med is working and if you want it to continue working you need to continue to take it.

mental illness doesn't give a fuck about race how much money you have what gender you are and any other bullshit classifications you can think of, its going to affect ppl regardless of all that shit. mental health/well-being and emotions doesn't have anything to do with those classifications either. zayn doesn't need to just grow up cause he already has he just has issues a good majority of ppl have. he has anxiety you want to know how common anxiety is in the uk where hes from there was 8.2 million cases of anxiety in the uk in 2013 and 64.11 million ppl lived in the uk in 2013. not only that in the uk mixed anxiety and depression is the most common mental disorder. in the us where i live anxiety is the most common mental disorder.

to me i interpreted your comment as saying that he needs to grow up because of how he felt and his mental health, and to me thats fucking bullshit. afaik he ain't doing much to promote his new album i wasnt even aware that he released a new album until i heard ppl talking about it, i just googled it it was released in 2018 and i didn't even really know about it till i saw ppl in discord talking about it in passing this year. afaik he aint going on tours for his album. so saying that ""considering what we see him doing now, that's a lot of bull, and rich..."" is bullshit too cause he aint doin anything like he was when he was in one direction.

That was the idea behind the concept, the  record ended up being much more about loss and real life than anything,  so I would say it's a good split.""

Twenty One Pilots- Trench which is a continuation of Blurryface.

* Blurryface is not wholly a concept album but it introduces the character Blurryface which represents Tyler's fears, insecurities, and negative thoughts in general.
* Trench [this thread has a really good explanation of the concept behind trench](https://www.reddit.com/r/twentyonepilots/comments/9gfc6g/an_explanation_of_trench_and_the_dema_universe/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)

Melanie Martinez- Crybaby: this is about a character named crybaby who comes from a dysfunctional family falls in love and gets sexually assualted"
vaxxhappened,ey3ybzr,t1_ey1sfle,1566776947.0,"as someone with hep b (i was born in south korea and my birth mother had it and i didn't get the vaccine in time) i did some research on it and like a good majority of ppl who have hep b don't even know they have it, and a lot of times the body clears it without any lasting harmful affects. however sometimes your body doesn't clear it and it becomes chronic. (lasts longer than six months). i have chronic hep b. and according to [hepb.org](https://hepb.org) the younger someone is when they get infected the higher chance they have of it becoming chronic. when its chronic its very beneficial to have it regularly monitored. not only that but you have a higher risk of developing liver disease. i can tell you from what my parents told me i was on interferon as a toddler to treat the hep b. if you don't know what interferon is its a drug that is also used to treat cancers. i have to get bloodwork done yearly and i have to get a sonogram done every 5 years. i can't drink alcohol or take tylenol or sulfa drugs. i have to be careful to some degree with what i put in my body. i would much rather have my child vaccinated against hep b than risk putting them through what i went through.

also ""ive never had an std so how can my baby have one"" ummm i don't care if its not probable there is still the risk that your child will be in a daycare (if you have to put them in daycare) or come into contact with a child or someone else that has hep b and hep b is serious. a lot of ppl who have it don't know it so they can transmit it wihout knowing. its better to have you child vaccinated and avoid the risk of having to deal with a lifelong disease than to not have them vaccinated and risk it."
TheRightCantMeme,ey3rqvs,t3_cv00cs,1566771997.0,"hearing ppl complain that public assistance goes to ppl who don't deserve it piss me off. im on public assistance cash assistance and food stamps and its not cause im lazy. i have mental illness that has made it hard for me to function normally. im in a residential rehabilitation program where they have housing available as well as a day program and the day program im in encourages you to get a job and go to school if you can, and for issues that are too complicated to explain i can't do either, but i work my ass off at the day program to get better mentally and to be able to function better. i may not have a job and i may not go to school but that doesn't mean im not working to get there. i have food stamps and cash assistance because im living on my own away from my parents and i need a way to support myself while im trying to get better and get towards my goal of getting a job and going to school.

edit: i forgot to say my point is not everyone on public assistance are lazy bums who are just mooching off the government. there are ppl out there who are doing the best they can working towards being able to support themselves without government help but need it at the moment just so they can have their basic needs met"
popheads,exjd6ip,t3_csmzeb,1566347472.0,"i mean like musically genre wise she isn't emo but this person is more asking if she's bringing the emo culture back. and im assuming (op can correct me if im wrong) but im assuming that when op is talking about emo culture they're talking about the 2000s pop punk craze. yes none of that is ""emo"" but the culture surrounding it was colloquially called emo, i mean on the popheads discord idk with all the new ppl in there, but i was known for liking ""emo"" bands at one point (those bands being my chemical romance fall out boy panic at the disco) none of the music is actually really emo but it was a culture that was referred to as emo. (im aware that this isn't the best wording but its the best i can come up with)  


to answer ops question i don't feel like she represents the emo culture well at least in the way that we know it. i do also want to say i feel like emo culture has never left; its just gotten less popular. like theres still ppl becoming fans of the bands that were considered emo there are still fans of those bands today. its just more of a niche thing now

&#x200B;

also i wouldn't lump avril lavigne under emo culture shes more associated with it rather than apart of it because she was marketed as being punk at a time when emo culture and punk culture were overlapping to some degree"
popheads,exfr5xe,t3_csagx9,1566246600.0,i forgot he existed (not saying it in a bad way when i used to watch troye youtube videos he would be in them sometimes and now that its been a couple years since i watched them i totally forgot about him until now)
popheads,exddzih,t3_cs8471,1566174100.0,"warning: pretty much all of what im recommending is either not pop or pop adjacent nothing is pure pop also not a lot of them are positive

if you want really sad and maybe triggering than try nothing,nowhere. nothing nowhere has said in an interview that he has depression as a result of debilitating panic attacks. he's not pop hes more emo rap but hes someone i listen to when im not in a bad place (only cause he does tend to make my depression worse when i listen to him and im depressed but that won't be the case for everyone) because i can relate to a lot of what he's saying  
specific songs i would recommend are:

* skully- talks a lot about self-hatred (choice lyrics ""im a fuck up"", ""ive got this feeling i won't make it to 25"", ""im an asshole let me die slow"")
* rejecter- im not entirely sure what this song is about overall but there are lines in the chorus alluding to attempting suicide ""laying on the freeway/thinkin bout what she said/waiting for a semi-truck/i don't give a fuck/ i just need a reason/i can't find a reason""
* better- wondering if his past was as happy as he remembers it (choice lyrics ""was it all really better than/or am i just getting in my head/and i just wanna go back/ i wish that i could go back"")
* houdini- to quote genius this song is talking about when he was living in his parents basement and killing useful time i recommend this song purely for the lines ""i'm too far gone don't try and save me/ i hate myself more than any man could ever hate me""

&#x200B;

twenty one pilots also deals with mental health. while tyler joseph has not outright said he has depression/anxiety a lot of his songs imply that he does struggle with mental health. [r/twentyonepilots thread where some asks for a source that josh dun has said that he has anxiety someone quotes an interview but the video is no longer available](https://www.reddit.com/r/twentyonepilots/comments/47kbcq/joshs_anxiety/)  some songs i would recommend are:

* friend please- written to a friend asking them not to kill themselves (choice lyrics: ""i know you want to leave/ but friend please don't take your life away from me"" ""and i have nothing else to say/but i will listen to you all day"" ""i feel for you but when did you believe you were alone"")
* kitchen sink-  this song is about tyler trying to find purpose in life (choice lyrics ""no one else is dealing with your demons meaning/ maybe defeating them can be the beginning of your meaning friend"" ""they will play a game and say they know what you're going through"")
* truce- this is kind of a for the fans song something that is often said in the fanbase and by the members themselves is ""stay alive fren"" and this is basically what that song is about  (choice lyrics ""stay alive, stay alive, for me"" ""the sun will rise and we will try again"")
* goner- this require some knowledge of the top universe this is on the album blurryface and basically blurryface is a personification of tylers fears insecurities and negative thoughts this song is about defeating him (choice lyrics ""don't let me be gone"" ""im a goner somebody catch my breath"" ""ive got two faces blurry's the one im not/ i need your help to take him out""
* neon gravestones- this is a song criticizing society's practice of glorifying suicide (choice lyrics ""promise me this/if i lose to myself/ you wont mourn a day/ and youll move on to someone else) 

&#x200B;

if you really want to try screamo then there's the amity affliction their unclean vocalist and primary songwriter joel birch has depression and alcoholism they also may be triggering (although i say this because when i listen to them and im depressed they tend to make my depression worsen) some songs i would recommend are:

* pittsburgh- from my understanding of the lyrics its about depression and feeling like things are hopeless (choice lyrics ""when i spend every waking moment wishing i was dead"" ""its like theres fire in my skin and im drowning from within/i can't take another breath please tell me im not undone"")
* all fucked up- genius says this is about joel birch's alcohol problems but i also interpret it to be about depression (choice lyrics ""my whole world's imploding i can't find the words"" the truth is is im all fucked up like you/ yeah we're all fucked up its true"")
* holier than heaven- i interpret this song to be about his alcoholism but it also seems to talk about feeling like your world is falling apart (choice lyrics ""my hands are chained and i am sinking/ to the bottom of the well"" ""my soul is too worthless to sell"")

&#x200B;

linkin park is obvious to me, as chester bennington died by suicide and had depression and addiction issues, as well as childhood trauma. songs i would recommend are:

* breaking the habit- mike shinoda wrote this about a friend (im assuming it wasn't chester based on how genius worded things) who had drug addiction (choice lyrics ""i try to catch my breath again/i hurt much more than anytime before/i had no options left again"" ""i dont know whats worth fighting for/ or why i have to scream/but now i have some clarity to show you what i mean"")
* given up- my interpretation of this song is chester is feeling like the world's ending (choice lyrics ""put me out of my fucking misery"" ""take this all away im suffocating/tell me what the fuck is wrong with me"")
* powerless- this song is talking about having a self-destructive friend/partner and feeling powerless to help them it was written by mike shinoda and rick rubin (choice lyrics ""and i was by your side powerless"")
* a lot of songs on one more light album including nobody can save me (choice lyric ""and only i can save me now"") talking to myself the content of the song holds the same feelings as powerless (choice lyric ""tell me what ive gotta do/theres no getting through to you) heavy ft. kiiara and according to genius it ""centers around the emotional weight of fixating on oneself"" (choice lyrics ""wish that i could slow things down/i wanna let go but theres comfort in the panic"") halfway right which is partly an account of chesters teenage years and partly a letter to his 7 year old self (at least thats what genius says) (choice lyric ""i dont lose i dont win if im wrong than im halfway right"") one more light was written after a friend passed away from cancer but took on a whole new meaning when chester died (choice lyric ""can i help you not to hurt anymore"")

&#x200B;

NF to some degree. in some of his songs off his most recent album, the search he talks about having depression anxiety and ocd some songs i would recommend:

* mansion ft. fleurie- talking about how his mind is a mansion that has different rooms that hold different thoughts (choice lyrics the entirety of the third verse) 
* how could you leave us- this is about his mom's death by overdose (choice lyrics: ""yo i dont know what its like to be addicted to pills/but i do know what its like to be a witness it kills"" ""i aint gonna say that i forgive you cause it hasnt happened/i thought that maybe id feel better as time passes/if you really cared about me then where you at then"")
* let you down- according to genius its about how nf is looking back at his past struggles and feels like hes let himself down (choice lyrics ""yeah i guess im a disappointment doin everything i can"" ""you don't want to make this work/you just wanna make this worse/want me to listen to you but you dont ever hear my words"")
* leave me alone- this song is personifying nfs fame and also going more indepth about his mental health (choice lyrics "" Diagnosed with OCD, what does that mean? Well, gather 'round/That means I obsessively obsess on things I think about"" ""Do the same things, if I don't, I'm overwhelmed/Thoughts are pacing, they go 'round and 'round and 'round"")

&#x200B;

lauvs sad forever talks about feeling depressed but not wanting to be depressed (choice lyrics ""voices always keeping me up/telling me that i should give up"" "" I don't want to be sad forever/I don't want to be sad no more/I don't want to wake up and wonder/What the hell am I doing this for"")"
AmItheAsshole,exd4ngl,t1_exctdwb,1566167134.0,"DISCLAIMER: I COULD BE INTERPRETING WHAT THEY MEAN BY A PSUEDO-ADDICT WRONG  
i guess i would fall under the category of a pseudo-addict in that ive never expreienced drug or alcohol addiction, however i have internet addiction and i self-harm which is a type of addiction in a way, and i use NA, and i think some of it is dependent on the area. like i would do better with emotions anonymous but the closest one is in a city about an hour away. that isn't accessible for me as i am in a residential rehabilitation program and i have no license and its at 130 in the afternoon on a monday. i could ride the bus sure but i have anxiety over getting stranded someplace with no way home. i believe that sometimes its okay for ppl to use a fellowship that doesn't really fit them if its cause its the most easily accessible. and like i don't think everyone who is a pseudo-addict is looking for attention in the sense that sometimes they would do better in a different fellowhsip but it isn't available  
also sorry if this is coming across as attention seeking i tend to feel like i don't belong in na for the very reason that ive never used drugs or alcohol and some ppl in my residential rehabilitation program were trying to get me kicked out of the na fellowship for that reason so ive become a bit more defensive theyve dropped it but like i still have that reflex defensiveness"

popheads,evydky5,t3_clfesd,1564929905.0,"didn't grow up with this artist but they've been a major part in my life- Twenty One Pilots

so some backstory a friend of a friend of mine in high school was talking about them and mentioned how good car radio was, so i went home and listened to it and my reaction was along the lines of ""this is rap i don't like rap"" didn't listen to anything else by them and just kinda forgot about them. at this same time i was also starting to get into my chemical romance fall out boy and panic! at the disco. fast forward to that summer and heathens comes up in my recommendations on youtube, i listen to it and fall in love with it, and end up checking out the rest of their music, and now car radio is my favorite song by them.

okay now for how they were a big part of my life. i got into them around summer of 2016 my mental health was already starting to decline and fall of 2016 is when i started my senior year of high school and my senior year was when things went to shit in terms of my mental health. i listened to them looked at their lyrics and just connected with them. i felt like someone got me and not only were they talking about their experiences with mental health but they were also talking about how they got through to the other side, so they also gave me hope. listening to them panic! at the disco fall out boy and my chemical romance got me through some of the hardest years of my life just because of how much i related to them. i moved out of my parents house summer of last year, and my mental health has been on a slow upswing since i moved out. twenty one pilots was what got me through living with my parents, with shit mental health and constant fights with them. i wanted to be dead because of how miserable i was living with my parents. i've tried to kill myself probs at least 5 times. im a little over 5 months clean from self-harm and the one constant throughout this journey has been twenty one pilots, and the hope they gave me."

I only really listen to their last three albums because they're more poppy. Misery is the closest theyve gotten to pop and Ive not listened all the way through yet cause i got bored whereas the album before that This Could Be Heartbreak is my favorite album by them and it's poppy but still has at least one verse with unclean vocals in all but one of the songs.

popheads,eq8kgdx,t3_bxcswd,1559867466.0,"DISCLAIMER: I KNOW TWENTY ONE PILOTS ARE MORE ALT POP BUT THE MEMBERS HAVE SAID SOME GREAT SHIT

tyler joseph from twenty one pilots has said some really funny stuff and he also has great ""serious"" quotes:

funny: tweet from january 30 2013- You know what? Sometimes you need to hear it: At least you're not a worm. Have a great day.

serious: ""You can be depressed and still have joy. You can be suicidal and still have joy. We al stop thinking and we all stop talking and we all stop sharing and we all stop creating, because by doing any of these things we quickly find out just how unhappy we are. But that's okay. That's normal. Don't let the fear of unhappiness cripple your pursuit of finding what you believe.  


and i'm not leaving out josh dun:  
funny: tweet from february 18 2015- ""the reason you are up at this hour of 5am right now is so you can go have some ice cream""- a thing my brain told me just moments ago

serious: It's worth it to stay alive. Because life is hard in the moment, it's hard to see what can be down the road. You get tunnel vision and think the current moment is all you have left. But that's not it. There can be more. Please let there be more. Please stay alive."
popheads,eq8iwjw,t3_bxh50e,1559866188.0,"seeing a lot of comments about streaming and as i love the physicality of cds i am very ocd about how i organize my cds. alphabetical order by artist and then within the artist (if i have more than one album by the artist) alphabetic by title. also numbers are before the alphabet and words like ""the"" or ""a"" don't count when it comes to the alphabetizing so for example my the 1975 cd would come before the cds i own by artists whose names start with a, and the amity affliction falls under an artist whose name starts with an a."
