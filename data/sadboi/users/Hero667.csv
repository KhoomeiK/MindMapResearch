Find a coffee shoppe, go there and enjoy it, read a book while you're there, write in a journal, eat some good food, and have some coffee. Soon the baristas will recognize you as a regular, just slowly get to know them. And let them slowly get to know you. 

Then, it's all a matter of just learning to approach and be approachable. Talking to those strangers at the coffee shoppe have no bad consequences if you fuck up. You stop going there and they will never see you again. 

If you learn to talk to strangers, talking to everyone else becomes easier.

Smile at people as you pass by; if you make eye contact, give them a smirk. It improves your social skills, and brightens their day.

Then it's just experience from there. You'll go on dates, and the first one will probably be awkward as hell. That's okay, and you'll find people you like and people you don't like. Again that's okay; that's all dating is, finding what you like, and more importantly, what you don't like, until eventually someone ticks all the boxes."

So yeah, they are depressed, but they aren't suffering from a depressive disorder. Sometimes, just sad doesn't cut it to explain the feelings one is happening. 

I agree, SOME people SOMETIMES get a bit carried away with labeling people as suffering from a mental disorder. However, the reason why so many are being diagnosed is that we have only recently learned as a society that it's a normal problem to suffer from depression. 

The one thing I will leave you with is, as a nurse, you have an obligation to give the patient the best care possible. (Ideally, economy and insurance fucks with everything) and taking every person seriously when they express depression is part of that. Yeah, most just suffer from depressive episodes, but not all. I'm not saying you're not doing this; I just want to make it clear to everyone. The reason we have the medical system we do, is to find symptoms and rule out all other causes so we can properly diagnose a patient. Misdiagnosing a patient with MDD and saying they're just sad is dangerous. Yes, MDD is characterized by much more extreme symptoms such as SB (suicidal behavior), however many people do not share this. Many people are still embarrassed to admit they harm themselves, or wish to die, for good reason. 

Hating your life is the first step to SB. I've seen it before. Gatekeeping like this will get people killed. Take everyone seriously until you can show it is just a depressive episode caused by environmental stressors rather than a seasonal episode, MDD, or PDD."

Everyone makes mistakes, everyone does shit they ain't proud of, everyone hurts people they love. So what you did does not mean you're a shitty person, or deserve some harsh treatment, or should be dumped. What would be best for the relationship, however, is a calm, collected apology and conversation on boundaries. Talk it out, explain your side, and listen to his side. Try and take yourself away from your emotions and think about the whole situation from your partner's point of view. Explain why you thought it was okay, and have him explain why he thought it was not okay. Then set those boundaries, make compromises.

Relationships are built on trust and understanding that was broken here, and needs to be repaired. It's not easy, no, but if you really care then you will go that extra mile to make him feel comfortable again."

But since the 1970s, wages have stagnated while the GDP grew, taxes on the middle class went up, and taxes on the wealthy went down.

The 1950s was our golden age, where the American dream was real. Now we live in an oligarchy, where the rich have the voice through lobbyists.

 Now, the American dream is dead. And it's all thanks to all the bullshit people have been fed. They believe that giving tax breaks to the rich will benefit them, and that the rich are job creators, that they control the economy. It's all bullshit; the middle class controls the economy; they are the job creators; they are the ones who spend money instead of hiding it in Swiss banks. 

If you want prosperity, and a revival of the American dream, we need to do a few simple things. Make unions a requirement for every job, lower taxes on the middle class and raise the taxes on the upper class, close the loopholes in the tax laws to get rid of offshore bank accounts, and raise the minimum wage to an amount that matches the standard of living costs. 

Doing those four things would increase tax revenue, which can be used for social programs, it would give workers a say, and it would provide people with an opportunity to escape poverty. Many of the poorest Americans work 3 or 4 jobs just to pay rent, raising the minimum wage would fix that. More money would be spent on consumerism, and the economy would flourish."

However, if this family is say, atheist, prayers can be not only useless but hurtful. My friend, after his grandma died, received so many ""our prayers are with you"" comments. The problem is not only is he an atheist, but so was his grandma. To him, the ""thoughts and prayers"" weren't for him; they were for the people saying them. It was a lame way for people to think that they're helping when, in reality, they aren't. Now, the comments from strangers didn't hurt as much as relatives' comments because he understands they don't know, but they still hurt. 


All I'm saying is we don't know the situation; we don't know who this family is and what they believe. So we should be careful with what we say to avoid further damage. I know with your religion a prayer is the proper reaction to something like this, but the fact is not everyone follows your religion.

Also, the flu affects a wide range of people, and most don't show symptoms. Covid-19 leaves many people with either little or no symptoms. Well, that sounds great, what's the issue? The issue is these people don't know they have a virus and spread it like peanut butter on bread. That is all over the place. The flu, also shows symptoms quickly, typically you're contagious one day before showing symptoms. Once you know you have it, you can take precautions. Again corona, is different. Covid-19 doesn't begin to show symptoms begin anywhere between 2-14 days after exposure. So for two weeks, you could be walking around with a virus, giving it to everyone you come in contact with before you even know you have it. Also, the flu, is not like covid-19. The flu, can be alleviated with anti-viral medicine. We don't know if it can lessen the affects of covid-19. The flu, has a vaccine, which reduces it's severity significantly. Covid-19 has no vaccine. The flu virus, is not new; people have immunity to it, Covid-19 is new, no one has immunity. The deaths per year in the US by the flu is at most 61,000, but that is taking many additional factors into account and adding in deaths in a very different way. The real number is estimated at 15,500, according to scientific American. On the other hand, Covid-19 has killed more than 58,000 people in 2 months. If the deaths continue, at this rate, which they will if we decide to reopen the country, we could be looking at far more than 350,000 people dead by next year.

No, the flu would not have killed this many people in this short span of time. And this is with us taking more precautions than we ever have taken during any flu season. No one wore masks during flu season, and the death toll wasn't more Americans than the Vietnam war in 2 fucking months.

This rhetoric that covid-19 is just as bad as the flu is not only wrong and irresponsible; it's dangerous. 75% of Americans think that the current stay at home orders are good or not good enough. Less than 25% of Americans believe we should reopen the country. And thanks to you and your rhetoric, people are going to die. This is not taxes; this is not debt; this is not immigration; this is life or death. Misinformation will, at best, kill people, at worst, kill a lot of people. So please, for the love of God, even if you are trolling to see people's reactions, stop. Stay at home, stay safe, and for Christ sakes get educated about this disease. We need to be together, and spreading misinformation not only drives us apart, but it also drives us to death. Please stay safe out there, and inform your friends and family about how to protect themselves and how to stay safe.

But someone still died, and that's still something (in my opinion) not worth celebrating. If others want to celebrate it, that's great; they're allowed to do that. I just can't in good conscience join in the revelry"

Just to reiterate, he is evil, a murder, and a dictator; he should have to pay for all of his horrible crimes. I never said he doesn't deserve punishment. The world is a little safer (hopefully) after his death. And it's a good thing for the betterment of humankind, but I'm not going to be happy about it."
rant,fom7vrl,t1_folzgvx,1587880915.0,"I'm a person of extreme empathy; I do feel bad for everyone who dies. But I'm not going to say you have to feel the same way. I sometimes voice my disgust when people cheer for an execution or the like, but I won't ever make someone see the world like me. Obviously, I'm not going to cry over the guy; he's an evil, horrible manchild. But I'm not happy he's dead either, I can never be happy for someone's death."
