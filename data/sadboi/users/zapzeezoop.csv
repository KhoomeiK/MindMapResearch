Another thing is the earlier you retire the more you have to go on the 3.5% rule instead of 4% rule: [https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract\_id=2920322](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2920322)"
premed,ffssm4g,t1_ffpept7,1580190962.0,Maybe they aren't pushing you to be a doctor. They just think this is what you want. If you tell them you dont want this they might encourage you in a different direction.
SJSU,ffpznd8,t3_emvzge,1580112548.0,"Go to COSAC tutoring for it. Also watch the organic chemistry tutor on youtube for his general chemistry videos. I got a good grade in that class, but I would say it's one of the hardest classes I had to take as a micro major."

fatFIRE,ffkxj74,t3_e4llg4,1580030770.0,"""I’ve also seen so many talented women leave with the intention of consulting/freelance/something PT but they can’t make a go of it and end up as SAHM.""

I don't think they ended up as a stay at home mom. If they had enough to retire on after quitting a very high level position they chose to be a stay at home mom. I think you are looking at quitting wrong."
personalfinance,ffksm2o,t3_etxj3x,1580028152.0,"I feel like he makes it seem overcomplicated and that it has to be on a luxury car. Say you buy a used car for 5000 dollars and there are 60000 miles on it. You look at the mileage that's currently on the car and how many more miles you can get (like 80000) where you still can sell the car at the same price according to a resource like kelly blue book.

So you drive the car from 60-80k in the mileage for however many years and then you sell the car for the same price you initially bought it for. Within that range the car doesn't change in value. I think the year of the car also matters too though."

fatFIRE,ff7zp5g,t3_emwxi9,1579662230.0,I heard it's really hard to get into commercial real estate with no experience. Also seems very risky given that you have no experience.
fatFIRE,ff7zo3s,t1_fds76e9,1579662209.0,"It could be better. A lot better, but if you don't understand why it's much better to just put it in index funds and withdraw at 3%."
fatFIRE,ff7mugf,t1_ff73s36,1579653326.0,That's what I want to do in the future. Sounds like a fun way to be FI.
