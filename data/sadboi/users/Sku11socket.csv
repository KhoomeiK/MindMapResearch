Growing up I never really felt loved, I always thought that they saw me as an obligation. It got to the point where I just wanted any form of escape. I would read, write, and draw but it just wasn't enough. By the time I was 15 I started drinking and I started doing drugs. A year of just being a junkie concerned my friend and she got me to go through therapy, rehab, and even a psych ward. At first I kinda acted like an ass about it but honestly, if it wasn't for her I'd probably be dead, I constantly live with thoughts of self hatred and guilt and I even attempted suicide 4 different times. It's been a rough road for me but I always tried to keep my head up even if everything felt pointless.  I've been sober for 6 years now and I'm still constantly working towards bettering myself."
