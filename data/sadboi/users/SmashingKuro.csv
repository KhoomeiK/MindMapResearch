doctorwho,fdbk8l9,t3_ekijli,1578258179.0,"So, to recap:

Missy's character development from Season 10 has been undone with no explanation, retroactively spoiling her death scene in The Doctor Falls.

The Doctor has gone back to casually mind-wiping people against their will, undoing her character development from Hell Bent.

It's heavily implied The Doctor causes The Master to be sent to a Nazi concentration camp. The Doctor. Hands someone over to the Nazis.

Lenny Henry planned to turn everyone into hard drives, or something. Why? What was his motivation? Doesn't matter, he's just evil.

The climactic scene is resolved off-screen in thirty seconds, followed by an exposition dump to explain what happened after all dramatic tension has already been removed.

Also, you can just kind of walk into someone else's TARDIS now. Cool.

Terrible episode from a terrible writer."
