I've been in therapy for a while and it's helped alot. Tho it's never one's fault when we become victims, there are often red flags in those situations, some which we can listen to and avoid becoming a victim. Other times all we can do is fight are best to escape or do whatever we can to survive. You see many red flags but for whatever reason, choose to stay in a harmful relationship. Where you feared for your life, but are still making excuses to avoid seeing the truth. Please be safe and look within and ask yourself why is it okay to you to keep yourself in a dangerous relationship. There are 1000s of people who are their authentic selves who aren't fucking psychopaths and killers to be. So many people who you can be yourself with, and who will share who they are without making you feel in danger"

The cat mom was fairly small and also old. She rescued it and didn't realize she was pregnant until a week before the birth. The vet said it's safer when cats have bigger litters because then they're smaller so they can fit in the womb

Dissociation,fox0i0v,t3_g9t6nr,1588131181.0,It's hard to tell from a video if you're disassociated. I don't know you so I don't know how you usually act. But most recreational drugs alter the state of mind and can cause some type of disassociation. Which isn't helpful esp if someone already disassociates or has mental health issues. If you do it regularly it becomes difficult to differentiate between side effects of the drugs and symptoms of a disassociative episode
