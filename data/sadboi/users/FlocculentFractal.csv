heroesofthestorm,fqt7eo9,t1_fqt3m5e,1589632231.0,"I think your point here is excellent, but just to counter it: it takes some skill and game understanding to know when to push and not push. Inaction is harder than action. New or naive players assume (at least I did) that doing something is better than doing nothing. It’s much harder to sit still and wait patiently. 

An entire game of just waiting isn’t fun, but there need to be situations where it’s a good strategy"
askphilosophy,fqsessj,t3_gklcjw,1589605340.0,"The argument that the behaviour of a protein molecule is ""infinitely complex"" is true in the literal sense but false in the sense of real world prediction. You can predict it's properties ab initio and we often do. But you don't need to. You can also understand behavior through experiment. This would still be a part of physics. The other arguments you're citing are also spurious. If something can be empirically observed, it can be predicted. This is a fundamental assumption in science and a deep philosophical question, but beside the point here. If the evolution of an organism is completely random, what are you going to do that a physicist cannot do?

One difference between biology, physics and chemistry is of focus. They describe the same world but use different lenses to look at it, and some disciplines study parts of the world others don't.

But the ultimate distinction is a human one. Fields are limited to what someone can study in a graduate program. The workhorse of science are graduate students. Professors are much fewer in number, and many students go into industry after graduate school. Once the knowledge in a field grows beyond this size, it usually splits into subdisciplines which a student can be expected to master (This is changing in some Fields where multiple postdocs are becoming the norm). You cannot study particle physics and the mating habits of koalas and surface chemistry, and if you do mix and match topics like this, you will not be of much use to society.

Ultimately it's both of these: philosophy/ way of looking at the world, and human limitations that keep these Fields separate"

truegaming,fny2cw8,t1_fnwoliq,1587351719.0,"Not a good RTS player here, but maybe the skill to learn is to do all that stuff without being stressed out or getting worked up.  


Doing something complicated but not feeling stressed starts feeling like confidence, even if you lose."
truegaming,fny0ziw,t3_g49px1,1587350801.0,"Some of the problems you're talking about are specific to RTSes but some affect online games in general. RTSes are in a weird place where there's a city building aspect, an army building aspect and a combat aspect, in addition to a micro- and macro- scale. Putting all these together is fun for a sandbox game, but multiplayer would put one of these ahead of the others, and maybe this concept just needs to be abandoned. (that's what's happening right now)

For an analogy, I'm thinking of triathlons here. It would be nice to be able to make up for deficiencies in one by doing well in the others, or teaming up with people good at the others, but popular RTS's tend heavily towards micro being the dominating factor and that can be unfun. Things that are fun:

* Scouting out the enemy base, finding out their strategy, and adjusting your strategy to counter it
* Small skirmishes for control of minor objectives
* Big all-out battles
* Base defense, with your prepared defenses, while you desperately replenish your units
   * i.e. the big turnaround. Hard to draw the line between this and turtling

Things that are not fun:

1. Using optimal build orders cribbed from the internet, and the feeling that you need to do this to stay competitive
   1. Particularly, cheeses. It's fun to cheese people once or twice. After that it becomes annoying to play against.
2. Playing against practiced opponents who've used the same build order 100s of times, and getting steamrolled, with no hope of ever being competitive
   1. It's fun to learn to play optimally initially, but once you realize you can't possibly beat the opponent without mechanical skill, players leave games
3. Small mistakes leading to large negative consequences, leading to overly safe playstyles (turtling)

(1) becomes an issue when using the optimal build order can give a significant enough advantage over any other, reducing the motivation to think through strategies yourself, at least at lower levels of play.

For (2), you need to have a chance to win, in a way that feels legitimate. From the other person's perspective, this will necessarily make some people angry. No matter how good you get, matchmaking will try to keep you at a 50% win rate, and that can be annoying when you feel like you're much better than the other person or that they got lucky.

Randomness is the core mechanic that can balance this, but it needs to be done in the right way to be fun.

* In the OP, you discussed randomizing unit stats. This is not enough, and not fun IMO, because there will still be a set of optimal build orders using the expectation of unit stats. You're adding some variance to it, but not in a fun way
* If you can randomize initial conditions, this will make the optimal build order no longer obvious, but this is not easy in the RTS context.
* Adding extreme randomness can solve this, but leads to a basically new type of game: What comes to mind is Battlegrounds/autochess games (where you get choices of units each turn, and pick/sell/combine them them to build an army, with alternating shop/combat rounds -- I'm basing the following on HearthStone Battlegrounds). There is a known set of optimal strategies, but there is so much randomness that you can't just decide to play one, you need to get the right units, and need to pivot to a different strategy sometimes which adds some excitement. This may be a viable idea to apply to RTS, but definitely needs work.
   * Because there are (say) 8 people participating, a win is being in the top 50%. You might still end up in the bottom 50% half the time, but it doesn't feel as bad.

I'm leaning towards the solution of varying initial conditions enough that you need to play a different strategy each time, though you will have an advantage knowing what the optimal army compositions looks like. Not sure how to to balance out the advantages of incredible micro."
TrueAskReddit,fnpd354,t1_fno4t0n,1587143387.0,"The book discusses that in detail, including the special case of countries with rich natural resources, like oil, that turned out alright, like Norway and Saudi Arabia.

TrueAskReddit,fnnvad8,t1_fnng9w7,1587102820.0,"South American colonies were stripped of gold and silver. All of that still maintains ""value"", in the sense that precious metals track inflation, but I can't say if it's still significant compared to total GDP being produced today.

One of the books above, ""Why Nations Fail"", discusses the impact of natural resources. Outside of the broad generalizations above, nations which did better are those without clearly exploitable natural resources. Some colonies (Mexico, Venezuela) were geared towards extraction of resources and sending them back to the colonizer, while others (such as the US) had to be geared towards developing human capital. Many countries of both types are legitimate democracies in many ways but the exploited ones are not equitable because systems were already set up to favour the very few, and they simply traded one master for another."

socialskills,f5ad3sy,t3_dn9322,1572105224.0,"The kind of parties I go to could be different from the ones you're at, so caveats apply. People who throw parties do it because they prefer the company of others to being alone. Since you're here, you're probably comfortable being alone, but some people actually can't stand it. Alcohol is definitely overdone, but it gives you a license to do dumb things, like smile at that girl or guy you like, or even talk to them. In low doses, it's can be relaxing and pleasant. 

So what do you do? I usually talk to people. We sometimes play games in small groups. I'd like to dance but I've always been too self conscious and I don't actually enjoy it all that much. Finding conversation topics isn't always easy but the best kind of group IMO is people where each person knows at least one other person, the rest are strangers. I'm definitely unusual but I'll talk about nerdy topics I'm interested in, like blogs and tech stuff and not everyone likes this but if you do find someone who shares your interests, you've made a new friend! It's also a chance to try to be funny. 

Following this advice you'll probably not go to a ton of parties but if you make even one friend from a party, it can be worth it. In the best case, it gives you a chance to meet a romantic interest, who you might have found it tough to approach in your ""natural"" environment."
