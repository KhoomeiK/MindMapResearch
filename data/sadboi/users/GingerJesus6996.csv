Nothing and no one is perfect.

Beauty is being confident in yourself, even when showering people with supposed flaws.

Try thinking of all the ways in which you do good or lift people up.

Try thinking differently. 

Change your perception of life by doing, reading and being open to all things. 

Look at eveything in life as two sides of the same coin.

Also, stay off social media. 
People are mainly fake and use it to make their lives look better. 

Social media, tv, radio... it's all manipulation.
