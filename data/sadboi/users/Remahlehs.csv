I can keep the i5 and still pull in 100+ FPS on most games on medium settings.

It's still a fair bit of cash to pick up the GPU, new monitor, and second stick of RAM. I have to ask: Is 1440p 100+ Hz Medium settings a huge upgrade over 1080p 60 Hz Ultra High?

Edit: Changed the link to include RX 5700 XT instead of RX 5700 w/ i7. XT consistently gets \~10 more FPS for only $50 more. I have changed my original choice from 5700 to 5700 XT."

You will always find things that you can do to improve yourself. What you don't realize is that, by searching for them, you continue to find faux fault in who you are. I got caught up in the self improvement wave and nearly lost myself.

This is my advice: pick a few things that are really important to you and ignore everything else.
