curlyhair,for9fb7,t1_foi46t9,1588008420.0,"We deal with enough internalized shame with this for other people to criticize us for doing it. I'm so sorry you had to deal with that. That was exactly my thing — I was in love with my hair and feeling its smoothness and then I'd find the hair that stood out from the rest and eliminate it. If I saw hairs like them on my friends' heads and I couldn't pull my focus away. I once even asked my friend if I could take a hair out for her. Haven't thought about that in a hot minutes. Not proud of that.

There are definitely a lot of similarities to an eating disorder in how it's an obsession and warps your perception of yourself. Even if we think of it as something we're doing to improve the way others perceive us (which was definitely my deal), people's perception really doesn't change it. They don't mean it, or, they don't see what I see. And when they draw attention to it, good or bad, it just brings your focus back to it and you fall into the whole cycle of fixating on it and feeling ashamed that you do. It's really, really hard and, then, when you feel like you can handle it, something new rears its ugly head. Hopefully your part is malleable and you have some freedom to play with it. Trich runs away with you when you're not even paying attention and that makes it 32894328x worse. Just know that it's never too late to hunker down and gather the tools you need to work on it.

Especially as a redhead, I felt like I was mourning the loss of my most valuable quality and it was really easy to blame myself for it. Eventually I finally came to believe that it was beyond willpower. It's basically an addiction. I recently found that pulling messed with my view of my hair, so while I thought all of it was getting unhealthier, it wasn't a reality, sort of like a form of dysmorphia. The sore scalp is such a pain though. Some hairs hurt a lot worse than others and you feel it all day. I've had dandruff too (just dry everything really) and I think it might just exacerbate what already is hurt and irritated from  the ripped follicle. When, say, hair comes out when you brush it, the hairs are already loose so it's not nearly as painful. I'm sorry about the bleeding! I haven't personally had that, but I know people who have and it sucks. Try not to punish yourself for it. The shame and frustration never helps and often makes it worse. Search around on the sub to find other tools for coping and ways to help curve your attention and hands to something else.

curlyhair,foegzbj,t1_fodfc9d,1587703534.0,"I get the scratching head thing (if I understand you correctly). I think I do that too. It's so tempting to pull when you're playing.

Beanies are the best. I'm so glad all of your progress was viewed as a victory! That was the hardest part for me because it felt like one step forward, two steps back, but I'm finally getting the hang of it with feeling proud in spite of my fallbacks. Oh boy, are my layers weird right now, especially since I impulsively snipped at the top layer, but I have faith in regrowth now, really because I have no other choice. Honestly totally get the paranoia thing. I'm jealous of the thickness of your hair! Sometimes I feel a hair that basically has the texture of sandpaper and it takes everything I have to not pull.

It feels freeing to have won this fight (for the moment at least) and feel grateful for the little hair I still have left — take note: this is basically all of my hair because I had so little even before I started dealing with trichotillomania. Seriously, I have like seven strands left, but the curls make it look like I have volume.

It's heartbreaking to know that so many people are battling similar disorders, but it's validating to know that we're all fighting these battles. If you're interested, I would recommend the sub r/trichotillomania for those with trich and I'm sure there are similar ones for other repetitive behaviors. The trich one was very encouraging and helpful for me. If I could share anything that helped me, it would be:

\- It's not your fault and it's not a matter of personal choice or conviction: these are body-focused repetitive behaviors (BFRBs) and they are cognitive disorders that, for the most part, you need external tools to overcome. I cannot stress enough how incredibly difficult it is to get through to the other side. It may take years or decades, but it's never impossible to find your way out.

\- Cut yourself some slack. One day in my good streak I broke down and cut off some of the hair on the top of my head and confessed to my mom with shame. She said that it didn't mean all of my progress was for nothing or that I had to start over. Like hitting an obstacle in a game of golf, you get a mulligan (another shot) and you can stay where you were in the game. The idea of starting at square one is daunting so don't let that discourage you.

\- If you can, try cognitive behavioral therapy. Try meditation or do things to occupy your hands. Fidget toys work for some, but not for all. They didn't really work for me so I tried breaking raw spaghetti or peeling grass, which worked sometimes. Though spaghetti was a little wasteful if I didn't make it after, which, admittedly, I rarely did. If you can't do any of the this, see below for other stuff I do.

\- A support group helped me some. I'm not sure what is happening in these times, but use this [link](https://www.bfrb.org/find-help-support/find-a-support-group) find out if there's one near you. There's apparently whole conferences dedicated to these, though, again, I don't know how those are proceeding.

\- List the environments that make you more likely to pull, pick, or engage in your behaviors and try to see if there are applicable ways to occupy your hands and/or attention. For me, these situations were any in which I was passively engaged, like watching TV, drinking or smoking, and procrastinating doing work. At night I was especially vulnerable because that was always when I was the most anxious and anxiety was definitely linked to mine. Even if it wasn't related to what I should be doing, I found ways to keep focus separately, like organizing or playing an instrument.

\- Once you're made it a bit, start keeping track. The success is gratifying if you can keep it up. I would put lil tallies on days on my calendar. I also use the free app *I Am Sober* which checks in with you at times you choose and tallies your time clean down to the second.

\- Because mine is rooted in the appearance of my hair, i.e. ""pulling weeds"" as I think of it, I compromised by letting myself snip off split ends with scissors. I have an ex who once said he did something similar for biting his nails by with keeping nail clippers around at all times.

\- If you have an attention disorder, explore options with stimulants that can help with impulse control. Obvi consult with a psychologist first.

\- This one take with a grain of salt or just disregard: If you have as little self discipline as I do, tell people after you've made it a few days. The potential shame of having to admit you relapsed might be a deterrent.

Open invitation to all: If you ever need to talk about a BFRB or just think aloud to someone who understands, please don't hesitate to reach out! This was my reality for years and I know all of the feelings of hopelessness and whatnot. I'm here for whatever you need. Even if you're just trying to find something to do instead of giving into the impulse. Could be now or could be months from now."

curlyhair,fodu062,t1_fo8ch2a,1587690098.0,"It's such a difficult battle and it's sad that few people who don't struggle with it don't know it's a legitimate cognitive disorder. My sister thought she was helping when she'd yell at me for doing it and that only made me feel worse and more depressed about it. I know stopping can feel like a pipe dream, or like you're not trying hard enough to stop, but I'm here on the other side, having used everything from therapy to meditation to haircuts, and I can tell you it's not impossible when you have the tools. I've been there when it's terrible, spiraling into cycles of frustration and shame and self-loathing, and I never thought I'd get out. The stress of not being able to stop even when I wanted to exacerbated everything.

I wish I could offer you concrete help as to how to stop, but unfortunately my urges just lessened randomly and I went with it. One night I broke down and cut off some of the hair on top of my head and confessed it with shame to my mom and she told me to think of it like a game of golf, in that if you hit an obstacle, you can take a mulligan or another shot. It was so encouraging to know that slipping up didn't mean I had to start at square one and that the progress I made wasn't suddenly worthless. I also think adjusting to Ritalin (I have ADHD) and minimizing my time in environments that made it worse (e.g. mindlessly lying around and watching TV) helped.

curlyhair,fodpuzf,t1_fo7gmwj,1587687855.0,"It's a cognitive curse. I wish I could give you a concrete answer, but one day the urge was just not as strong and I went with it. I've tried everything from meditation to haircuts to therapy to fidget toys, but one day I just realized I hadn't pulled my hair all day. And then the next day and the next. I have so little discipline, which is its own issue, so after about a week of it, I told my close friends and family as what I think was a subconscious choice to hold myself to it so I wouldn't have to face the shame of admitting to them that I relapse. I will say that medication (Ritalin) helped keep my focus (I have ADHD) as I usually pulled in situations where my attention was drifting or passive, like watching TV or lying around. Nowadays, when I find myself in those moments, I do something that requires all of my attention and my hands, like playing an instrument or doing some design project or cleaning. Just remember to cut yourself some slack. Slip ups don't mean you failed or that you have to start at the beginning. My mom put it in terms of a game of golf: if something gets in your way, you get to take a mulligan (another shot, if you don't know). You don't have to restart the game. Because my trich was really appearance based (I use the metaphor of ""pulling weeds"" to improve my hair) I also compromised with myself that I could snip off split ends if I found them.

curlyhair,fod7m21,t1_fo5xlv6,1587681263.0,"Thank you, friend! It's such a difficult battle to fight, and I'm so proud to hear you've overcome it. Congratulations! Wishing you continued success :)"

curlyhair,fod7dqb,t1_fo5w619,1587681157.0,"Thank you, friend!"
curlyhair,fod7d6h,t1_fo5v23n,1587681150.0,"Thank you so, so much! It's one of the hardest things I've ever done. Congratulations on your recovery! You should be proud. And thank you for your kind works. I wish you continued success :)"
curlyhair,fod71oj,t1_fo5ux98,1587680987.0,"Thank you, sweet friend! Don't be fooled, this is basically all of the hair I have — but it's not nothing. This protein whatever I used from Shea Moisture has saved my life. I finally can touch my hair without feeling like it's a mess on my head. Thank you for your support :)"
curlyhair,fod6ger,t1_fo5rbhh,1587680715.0,It's such a terrible burden made only harder by the fact that so few know it who don't struggle with it. I hope you're getting the support you deserve! Remember to cut yourself some slack and know that slip ups don't make all of your progress worth it. It's an uphill battle and you're not alone. You've got a whole army behind you! My DMs are always open if you need to talk or think aloud to someone who understands :)
curlyhair,fod5wdp,t1_fo5p4ta,1587680425.0,Thanks a lot! My curly girl method success is truly keeping me sane and helping me like my hair again. Thank you for your kind words. Same to you! :)
curlyhair,fod5s7j,t1_fo5nm4f,1587680364.0,"Thank you so much, friend! I feel good and it's great to start to like my hair again. Appreciate it :)"
curlyhair,fod5jzw,t1_fo5nhw9,1587680245.0,"Please don't, though I would be immensely flattered. Thank you so much nonetheless! :)"
curlyhair,fod5g8y,t1_fo6ajxx,1587680190.0,"Thank you, sister! I am proud of myself. From someone on the other side, I want you to know it's possible. There were times when I spiraled into cycles of hopelessness and self-loathing and sometimes it just didn't feel worth it to try. It's a tiresome and painful process, probably one of the hardest challenges I've ever dealt with, and people who tried to help would inadvertently make me more anxious. I don't feel quite like a badass yet, but hopefully I will. Remember to be good to yourself and slip ups don't mean that all of your progress was meaningless. Thank you so much for your kind words. I hope that your trich will be a distant memory soon. Best of luck :)"
curlyhair,fod3a4y,t1_fo5ybcy,1587679306.0,"Thank you, friend! It's been an up-hill battle, but I'm finally starting to like my hair again. Best to you :)"
curlyhair,fod37ma,t1_fo5pz7w,1587679281.0,"Wow! Congratulations on your success! You are a superstar and I'm so proud of you. I've always played with my hair, even before pulling, and I still catch myself playing with some strands but now I barely have the discipline to drop my hands. I would spiral into a cycle of self-loathing realizing that I was losing what little hair I had, but now I'm able to appreciate it, especially with the new curls. You're giving me such hope for a regrow! How long did it take to regrow? What kind of hair do you have?

It hasn't grown back much, at least that I've noticed, but the lil bits seem a little coarse, which completely defies my misguided belief that I was getting rid of the ""bad"" hairs for good. Ultimately I know that those hairs help my volume since my hair is so fine. I've heard that thing with new texture. Honestly hoping for some of that because my under layer of hair is straight and it drives me mad. Congrats again! :)"
curlyhair,fod0snp,t1_fo5mdoa,1587678431.0,"Thank you! I'm grateful to be able to like my hair again. It's such a difficult struggle and it's comforting to know that there are allies like you out there. Your husband, sister-in-law, and mother-in-law are lucky to have you! :)"
curlyhair,fod0953,t1_fo5kj2f,1587678223.0,"Thank you so much, friend! Your support is much appreciated :)"
curlyhair,fod07m4,t1_fo5jpa3,1587678206.0,"Thank you so, so much! I truly appreciate it. Anxiety is a hard-won battle, and mine was definitely connected to my trichotillomania, and I'm so proud of you for overcoming it. Congratulations on your recovery! It's an invisible battle we fight and it is not to be understated. You're a rockstar! All best :)"
curlyhair,foczv6b,t1_fo5gclw,1587678074.0,"Thank you, friend!"
curlyhair,foczug2,t1_fo6kc06,1587678066.0,"It's really difficult when you struggle with something so few people realize is a real disorder. I'm so happy for you in your recovery. Let those eyebrows shine, even if you're stuck indoors and can't really show them off! More time to grow. My eyebrows are so light that my older sister used to make missing posters for them, so take comfort in that. Keep fighting the good fight. I'm rooting for ya :)"
curlyhair,foczisf,t1_fo5xi7q,1587677945.0,"You're going to make me cry. Thank you so, so much! :)"
curlyhair,foczhmm,t1_fo5fsdl,1587677933.0,"Thank you! It's actually been six years of dealing with it and I recently stopped, but still big and your congratulations is still appreciated! I'm finally starting to be proud of my hair  again and your kind words are very encouraging. Thank you so much, friend! :)"
curlyhair,focz31d,t1_fo5dajz,1587677783.0,"Thanks a ton! I really appreciate it. It feels so good to like my hair again, what little there is. Thank you so, so much. It means a lot :)"
curlyhair,focyoz9,t1_fo5c8ei,1587677632.0,"Thank you so much, friend! I'm finally starting to believe it. You've put such a smile on my face :)"
curlyhair,focylil,t1_fo5iwd0,1587677597.0,"Thank you so much! You're a ginger as long as I'm concerned. I'm here on the other side telling you that it is possible to stop. Remember to cut yourself some slack. Slip ups don't mean that all of your progress was worthless and you have to start at square one. Something got in the way, like a game of golf, and you get a mulligan! Wishing you the best of luck! :)"
curlyhair,focyddb,t1_fo5h3s5,1587677508.0,"Thank you! I hope so too. Mine would spike whenever I felt a loss of control and this situation brings me the biggest loss of control I've ever experienced. For that reason it's more crucial than ever that I create a routine and stick to it. I pulled the most when I was doing passive things, like watching TV, which sucks because I watch TV like 70% of the time now. I do a lot of design so I've been doing projects that require my full attention and both hands, like editing, but I've also found that cleaning and organizing things keeps my mind focused. It's possible for you to stop. Believe it and keep fighting the good fight. You've got an army behind you! :)"
curlyhair,focx33m,t1_fo5edr8,1587677019.0,"You're making me blush! I hope I'm a badass. I'm enough of a degenerate. Thank you so, so much. It was one of the hardest things I've ever had to do, but I'm on the other side now and here's hoping I don't fall back. Thank you for your kind words :)"
curlyhair,focv03j,t1_fo5bc3w,1587676245.0,"Thank you so much! I used to hear it and get anxious about drawing attention to the mess on my head, but I'm starting to get better about it and you've made my day. Thank you, friend :)"
curlyhair,focusd8,t1_fo5a8d0,1587676168.0,"Thank you so much, friend! It's been one of the biggest cognitive challenges of my life and I'm so glad it's behind me. Let's hope it stays there. Your support is very much appreciated! :)"
curlyhair,focujlo,t1_fo5947f,1587676077.0,"Thank you so much! It's basically my entire head of hair in this photo, but I'll take it. Hopefully more will grow during quarantine. Thanks for the support, friend! :)"
curlyhair,focu756,t1_fo5mv5r,1587675932.0,"Thank you, friend! It's definitely been an uphill-battle of hopelessness and shame and self-loathing and I didn't think it was possible. I'm here on the other side I want you to know it is possible! Be good to yourself, and don't hesitate to reach out to talk or just want to think aloud to someone who understands. It's a hard fight, but you've got an army behind you :)"
curlyhair,foctl03,t1_fo5lvju,1587675679.0,"Thank you, fellow trichster (just learned this term and can't stop using it.) It's an invisible (for argument's sake) battle all around and it's especially hard when few who don't struggle with it don't know it's a real thing. You're not alone and stopping is possible! Remember to be nice to yourself, which is something I often forgot to do. Best of luck, and hopefully this will only be a distant memory soon :)"
curlyhair,foctb8o,t1_fo5jj6n,1587675563.0,"Thank you so much, friend! It's been really hard and it feels so good to be on the other side. I never thought I'd make it, but here I am. Best to you :) xxx"
curlyhair,foct7sn,t1_fo5mbjk,1587675524.0,"Thank you, fellow trichster (I've just learned that term from other commenters.) I'm right there with you; I know the frustration and the hurt and the hopelessness. It's a battle on all fronts, but I'm here on the other side and I believe you can do it. A slip up doesn't mean any progress was for nothing and you have to start at the beginning. You can pick up where you left off. Be good to yourself and stay with it. Good luck!"
curlyhair,focrt68,t1_fo5ffc5,1587674991.0,"Thank you so much! Really appreciate it. It's incredibly difficult to deal with and it's hard when so few people who don't have it know about it. It's a cognitive and physical battle to fight and I hope it's a distant memory for you soon. Remember to cut yourself some slack. I'm sure you've tried everything under the sun, but my ex found it helpful with biting to keep clippers around at all time. Best of luck, friend! :)"
curlyhair,focoe3g,t1_fo5yo2e,1587673778.0,"I totally get it. Turns out all those hairs were the volume in my hair, so here's hoping it comes back (and maybe isn't textured or crinkly for the love of god). My worse moments were when I was doing something passively like watching TV or talking to people. I'm trying to do things that require my full attention and both hands, like editing things and organizing. You've got this. Make that 3% your bitch! :)

Note: Pretend I didn't say bitch and said a synonymous yet non-gendered word."
curlyhair,foco0gj,t1_fo5etg6,1587673647.0,Amazing! I hope you're proud of yourself. You have to battle your brain and your hands and sometimes it feels like a fruitless attempt. Congratulations on your recovery! Your hair sounds gorgeous. Nac seems to be a good option for many! You're killing it out here. Here's to trich being a (bad and) distant memory! :)
curlyhair,focnmyb,t1_fo5f7vo,1587673508.0,"I love this term. It makes me feel like we're magical. Or conniving. Maybe both. Thank you for your kind words. They mean a lot. This photo is basically all my hair so it's still an uphill battle, but people who lose their hair, through chemotherapy for example, are able to have a hair renaissance so it's possible for us. I've been where you are and I know the hurt and frustration. If you need to talk or just someone to understand, I'm here literally always. Best of luck to you! :)"
