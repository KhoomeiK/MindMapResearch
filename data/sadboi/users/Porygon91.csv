COVID19positive,flf4nwh,t3_fo6m63,1585097970.0,"I think I had a mild form in feb. 

I started out with a stomach ache and no appetite and was extremely tired like falling asleep downstairs tired. I slept then woke up during the night with a sharp throat, hot and sweating and a painful cough. My fever broke the next day but I was drained and just had this painful cough for a few days and still a sharp throat this lasted about 5 days and I thought I was getting over it and woke up with my throat feeling like it was on fire then by day 7 I was mostly better I just couldn’t walk far without my chest hurting for a few days and when I coughed I had a strange sound coming out of my chest, I can only describe it like when you open a can of soda and leave it and you hear the bubbles. Took a while for my fatigue to go away too, same with the cough but I’m better now. I did try bring out phlem in little bits and at one point there was a bit of blood but I put that down to coughing so hard.

I don’t know if this was COVID but it was just strange that my other half went down the same time as me but with a fever, headache and dry cough. So we will be getting anti body tests when they are out in the UK.

I hope this helps either way x"

2/26 finished having a tattoo done, after I felt really really tired like absolutely washed out. No appetite, stomach pain. (Thought it was from a long tattoo session until the next day)
2/27 sweating like mad in bed, sore throat, started coughing
2/28 painful coughing 
2/29 painful coughing but felt a bit better 
3/1 throat felt like it was on fire and super lethargic again 
3/2 woke up feeling fine, just the odd cough and my chest sounded like when you leave a can of pop/soda open, that fizzing sound when breathing. 

I’ve probably missed out some details cos my memory is crap. But yeah not sure if all this was cos of the intensity of the tattoo session or if it was this. But my other half got sick near the same time so. Who knows? If I did this was probably a mild case but either way I thought  I’d add in my two cents/experience.
