Constantly signing expensive free agents (even if they're your guys) isn't sustainable. It does suck watching players leave and ball out though. You just can't pay um all, it isn't baseball."

Tried lots of ways and this way I can get almost all the reclaim, no mess, and I don't have to use it all at once."
Dynavap,fop5z85,t1_foovru4,1587953827.0,"Try heating it without anything in it so you don't combust, and heat past the first click and there should be a second one. With a torch and heating low (higher temps) you really don't want to go past the second click more than a second. With an IH, I go two seconds past the second click. I also heat before the second cool down click, much faster extraction. Had the same cap for over a year so it's not harming it, at least not enough for me to care.

This is all for my specific cap, yours may slightly differ (some don't have two clicks? or can have a click closer to the combustion temp). As a side note, I've found quality of cannabis effects vapor production quite a bit. If you've got some ""just ok stuff"" don't be surprised if you can't get huge clouds."

discgolf,foi40dn,t1_fohzn4v,1587778253.0,"I've found that the faster and more stable a disc, the more it masks forearm mistakes just like with bachhand throws. Learning how a slower, less stable disc needs to be thrown will translate into driving technique for off the tee shots. 

So basically, if you're throwing an ultimate disc forehand, you should have a decent grasp on the ""flick"" motion needed for a good forehand technique."

discgolf,fohdqrc,t1_foh842q,1587764249.0,"It does make you really good at aiming the nose of the disc for sure. I just love putting. It's so relaxing to toss putters for hours. Been working on straddling and increasing my regular putting stance distance (not using a jump or step). I feel like if I'm reaching the basket at least at 60', 30'-40' putts are going to feel a lot more effortless allowing better aim."
discgolf,fogmxub,t1_fog03v6,1587754615.0,"Putting in the wind seems impossible at first, but once you figure out how to release the disc with the right angle it's kinda fun. It's like doing field work with a Nova, it's going to show you what you did wrong.

I really enjoy floating a putt in the wind super slow with the perfect amount of wing showing. Sometimes I can get it to look like a ghost is carrying the disc into the basket cause it's floating so slow."

Got divorced and finally have time to disc again, but I ended up in western Nebraska... Ya. Moved to Lincoln, NE last fall and I'm back in the swing, picking it up where I left off. Now I want to compete and keep the progress moving forward. I'm addicted and I love it."
discgolf,foflqr6,t3_g62q54,1587738498.0,"In Nebraska that's pretty common wind (15-20mph). If I only went out when it wasn't windy it'd only be once or twice every couple of weeks. It makes you appreciate the calm days.

I also wanted to start some competitive play this season so I like practicing in the wind so I know how to play in it. Putting in heavy wind will teach you release angles real quick.

I will skip certain water holes on windy days. One in particular is a really simple downhill hyzer with an island in a swamp so I don't throw that on windy days. I've lost enough discs there already..."
discgolf,fofjrdf,t1_foej3k1,1587737367.0,"Imo learning how to flick a putter is the best way to learn how to throw a proper forehand. You can't use too much arm and and have to learn the right wrist technique in order to get a smooth release from the hand.

Flicking putters taught me how to actually use a forehand technique and not just *throw* an overstable meat hook with all arm.

I also think being able to forehand a putter 100-150' is a super valuable skill (no wind though please). It's so easy to aim compared to a backhand anny line. I trust my zones to hit tight windows more, but I can't get a zone to sit down like a putter on a hyzer line forehand."

At the time it seemed like just one guys experience and for whatever reason I got a disingenuous vibe from it. After this happening day one, I was fearing the worst.

Their customer service made me feel totally different. They stand behind their product and made it clear they care about their bags holding up out there. I'm still using the bag and getting it fixed as soon as they can. They were honest and put an effort in. Somebody pumping out shit that they don't care about wouldn't do that.

The bag is the bee's knees and I really like it. I have no complaints other than the defect and... No D rings kinda sucks but it's got Velcro so whatever."

discgolf,fodjefv,t1_fo9nqeh,1587685430.0,"You have to take in account the speed as well not just the stability rating. A teebird has zero turn but if you hit it like a destroyer on a flat release it's gonna turn a bit before coming back to a fade finish.

If you factor in the speed to stability relationship it's a more reliable system. It's definitely not perfect, but I don't think it's meant to be nor should it be. You're never going to be able to look at a description of a disc, take it off the shelf and have it throw exactly how it says (assuming this is a new mold to you). The traditional Innova flight ratings give you a good idea of what a disc should do *if* you have the correct arm speed for it. In order to really learn a discs flight you need to try it out and see what it does for you and what it can't."
