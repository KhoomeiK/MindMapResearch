Horticulture,ew93sqe,t3_cna6kv,1565219208.0,Wish i knew. Could it be a root problem? Do you make sure it doesnt sit in the run off water for a long time? My guess is its a root problem

depression,ew86rra,t3_cn6i1n,1565204430.0,I worked for my dad for a while. He treated me like a slave and underpaid me. He was very dis respectful towards me and has no manners. I remember 1 day in particular when i went into a dreamy state thinkin about suicide. I had to walk away to think about it and my dad just followed me moaning at me to get back to work. He brought my mate out and payed him almost double what i was getting. I dont work with him now and dont talk to him unless he speaks to me. He wont appologise or admit he was wrong so....fk him
depression,ew86a9s,t3_cn7uwq,1565204150.0,Yea i can hardly ever remember what happened the day before. My past is 1 big foggy haze. Im pretty sure i will end up with parkinsons or demensia or somethin. Im 36 i should have a good memory. Always gotta write things down etc
depression,ew85ltj,t3_cmxltz,1565203761.0,I had a similar experience. I started writing down all the things that were bothering me and figuring out how to change them. 3 years later and my life is only just starting to go in the right direction but far too slowly. Im frustrated as hell and hate my life but trying hard to change it. I suppose hope is what keeps me goin

depression,ew84ecn,t3_cn5vlj,1565203077.0,I remember a few years back i would lie down at night and i would groan and say oh fuck oh fuck and in the morning i would wake up and say oh fuck oh fuck. My life wasnt worth living and still isnt 3-4 years later but everyday now i fight it and try to improve things everyday. Its almost impossible to make things change. Its like the worlds default is to keep u down in the mud

depression,ew5p3sa,t3_cmxvt2,1565141644.0,"Keep getting your medication changed until u find 1 that u think works or helps. I had to try 4 and only a few months ago realised this 1 could be working. Start a personal development plan. Iv been writing stuff for the past 3 years. look at what u hate about yourself and your life. Use the whole notepad if u need 2. Then figure out what u can do to improve the issues. Look at the problems as opportunity for improvement. Make a plan, break down the plan into how u can work towards it everyday. Theres things u cant change so dont focus on them just focus on what u can do. In my plan for example i hate that my teeth went yellow. I cant afford to fix it. I will brush everyday, stop smokin etc but my career plans mean that i should be able to fix it in future. The list of things pissin u off probably wont get smaller. Mine hasnt but i work towards the goal everyday. It takes time (too fkn long) but if u keep goin then life should start to move in the right direction. I started my personal development plan in 2016 and nothing happened for ages but now things r starting to move in the right direction. Everyday i work to my lists"
