My only advice as such is to try to not focus on the numbers so much (preferably not weigh yourself at all, but I know it's hard losing that ""control"") and instead focus on how you feel. Make sure you're eating enough (which 900 kcal definitely is not), and if it's available to you consult with a therapist.
