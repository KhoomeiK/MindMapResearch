I'm fat, hairy and a little bit tall, and while women don't usually find that attractive at all, it seems there's a lot of gay men who consider that incredibly attractive. I have known three gay men who were into ""bears"" and at least two have of them were really direct at letting me know they find me attractive. That's honestly so frustrating, like, why am I in wrong quadrant? those who not attract me find me attractive and those I find attractive find me ugly. Ugh"

Also, there's some implicit social contract that gives everyone the understanding that they are just saying it, it's not like you should expect them to act upon it. Humans can be so confusing and frustrating some times."

IncelsWithoutHate,ez8o9ec,t1_ez857y2,1567750958.0,"It is actually quite hard to get into the minds of people who have been indoctrinated with this level of efficiency. 

You have guys that have been rejected by everyone for most of their lives, and then they came here where they are accepted, but they have to renounce of their individual thoughts and share the same beliefs and even terms. 

Saying things like ""gtfo you only care about looks and would never date a men who's  less than an 8 and if you do you cheat on him and if you don't you fantasize about doing it and if you don't you're lying"" gets them more acceptance, so it's vicious circle of toxicity. 

I'm not saying it's an excuse, I'm just trying to give you some context so it's easier for you to empathize and understand them."

IncelsWithoutHate,ez8nf2b,t3_cyzxs5,1567749891.0,"Fun fact about me: when I was 19 a friend took a picture of me and it magically made me look attractive. I still post that same photo from 9 years ago from time to time into different subreddits like ""rateme"" using my main reddit account. 

Most of the times I get a lot of really nice compliments and I can fantasize about not being as ugly and fat as I am today. It makes me forget about it for just a moment. 

It takes me back to those days, I would usually get catcalled by women on the street and a lot of female friends would overtly sexualize me, just as men are known to do with women. 

I'm not trying to humblebrag or anything (it was a long time ago), but what I am saying is that woman do call men handsome/hot. Also I'm not tall, I'm 5'10'' and I never looked like a supermodel, even in my best years.

Funny enough, I do think you have a point. When flirting, lots of men go by complimenting the appearance of the woman, that almost never works, since they indeed are used to do it. Try complimenting something else about her, her skills, hobbies, random things that you genuinely like. However, women do like to being called being beautiful (I mean, not because they are women but because they are human beings, and we do like to feel attractive) but, it's better when you have a relationship with her (not exactly when you get laid)."

AvPD,ez8liso,t3_cwizly,1567747650.0,"Today I helped a coworker with a programming issue, there were other two guys trying to help him but I was actually the one that solved the problem.

Then when I was doing code review a much better solution came to my mind and told him about it. He told me in my native language something akin to ""you're freaking awesome"".

It felt great, honestly. My AvPD makes me think I don't actually deserve to be where I am and that I'm going to be fired at any moment for being incompetent so that was a big ""small victory"
