cringepics,fq5n1kn,t1_fq4zch5,1589111451.0,"First of all, even in cat years they wouldn't be adults yet.

But let's tackle the aging aspect. I'm not going off canonical info because I haven't played the games.

Let's define the range of age definition with the short end being a standard house cat, and the longer life being a standard human. 

So where on that spectrum would they be? 

Considering they understand and reciprocate complex communications in full, and appear to have some form of critical thinking, they have a complex, and higher developed brain. This is a substantial difference from cats. Contrary to popular belief, of the more intelligent pets (mammals and birds), cats have a less developed brain. What is perceived as intelligence is more accurately a lack of social structure and having more independent survival instincts. 

They also, by and large, look incredibly similar to humans, being bipedal, hands meant for grasping and throwing (the latter of which being extremely unique to humans), with all appendages resembling humans, including spinal structure, and a human nose instead of the slit-sided predator nose. I will add I assume they have a human reproductive system because otherwise you wouldn't be able to fuck them, and i feel that's an important point for a lot of people.

The differences (with some assumed) are retractable claws (assumed), mostly canine teeth (assumed?), cat ears, cat tail, fur on the 2 previously mentioned traits, cat tongue (assumed) and cat eyes (assumed). Most, if not all, of these traits are not unique to cats in structure. Many other animals have similar or the same ability as these traits give cats. 

Conclusion: cat girls appear to be more biologically similar to humans, thus most likely age similar, but still faster, to humans.

And to repeat: even in cat years, they wouldn't be adults yet.

So yes. They are children. They are lolis. Appearance =/= age. And that goes both ways.

Ninja edit: age of consent is generally determined by mental development. Thus, even if their bodies have developed faster, if their clearly higher intelligence brains haven't had enough time to develop (especially since their capabilities strongly resemble our level of intelligence), they would not be of age in that regard.

Edit 2: to add, yes. Lolis are partially an age thing. Any anime girl under the age of at minimum 13 is a loli. Not all lolis are under the age of 13, mind you. But there is no way in hell, if they are 9 months old, and age more similarly to humans, older than 8yr old. And that's being ubber generous. Idc what Canon says. They have been alive for less than a full year. No higher intelligence being would be mentally developed enough to consent to anything."

Non-direct encouragement.

Like others said, read to them regularly, and encourage their interest. Be supportive when they want to do it themselves or take more steps into the medium. Let them pursue it as they want to, and on their own. You don't need to comment on it everytime. I think its best to generally not directly comment on it, but occasionally talk about if they have recommendations, have read something interesting,  etc. But keep it within moderation.

Lead by example. Reading together but separately can do wonders imo. You don't have to be reading the same book, but being present, together, reading your respective literature I think is more powerful than people give it credit for.

These are the general guidelines to instill and nourish your child's interests. But also be prepared for if they just aren't interested in reading. The worst thing you can do is to not engage in whatever interests they develop. You want to teach them that it's ok to be passionate about something, and to express that joy to others.

DankLeft,fm99rmk,t1_fm5gp66,1585864434.0,"So, if you want a sad/feels movie, I think 5cm per a Second might be a better movie. Going in, its 1hr, split into 3 parts, and follows 1 guy at different stages in life. It's by the same guy who made Your Name (Mikoto Shinkai).

For this coming season, watch Tower of God. I will guarantee you will enjoy it. 

If you enjoyed Darling in the Franxx, and want to sillier and over the top version of it, I'd recommend Gurren Lagaan or Kill La Kill. It's a turn your brain of and let the stupid action carry you. Both are made by Studio Trigger. 

If you want something more serious instead, Vinland Saga is what you'd want. Its 24 episodes, and set in like 1000's and Viking times. 

My stretch show would be Shingeki no Bahumet: Genesis. It didn't get that popular but I think it's a hidden gem.

Now here are some recommendations that are just personal favorites of mine that I didnt mention in my previous comment:

If you want a movie that just is super stylized and is pure eye candy: Redline. Damn thing took 10yrs to animate.

Full metal Alchemist - you wont find someone who dislikes the show. 

Tsurezure Children: A cute romance show full of shorts. Easy binge.

Lastly, want to hear Samuel L. Jackson voice the 2 main characters in a show with a dope sound track?

Afro Samurai.

For synopsis of these shows, myanimelist can give some more details"

So fuck off."
