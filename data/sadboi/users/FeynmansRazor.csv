SuicideWatch,fpm6f7j,t1_fplxw3o,1588726512.0,"Western Society got to where it is now because it promotes individualism. That's how we get things like rationalism, free-speech and human rights. The problem is that by going too far in that direction, we lose connection to others. This is how collectivist societies are, ironically, actually much better equipped culturally to deal with the isolation of rapid, technological transformation (though historically they could never induce innovation by themselves).

I think the pandemic is showing how working from home is already more viable than thought. In the future, I can see the disappearance of the ""commute into the city"". In terms of nature, I actually think the bigger problem is not just reconnecting with it, but teaching humans to value *authentic representations of nature* when virtual simulations are everywhere. Because that's definitely going to happen."
SuicideWatch,fpm4n4v,t3_ge4tw1,1588725471.0,"You have options. You can become a slave to money. If you're blessed with marginally higher than average IQ, you might be able to devise a solution to your problem. Failing that, you could always move somewhere with less economic pressure, like another town, another country, your mom's basement.

If the cost of living is lower, then maybe you can work a less stressful job, and find time to follow your passion. Then you could do what you really want to do. It's your life, and you only live once. But you always have a choice. Don't convince yourself you don't. 

I do agree the state of society is depressing. But things will change in the West too, slowly.  We're approaching a point where we need universal income in the West to keep society from falling apart. Capitalism 2.0 has to revolve around what we find meaningful, and a move towards using happiness and well-being as measurements rather than just GDP. The alternative is continued decline, in which case you really should move somewhere else."

My impression was that I wouldn't be able to use the organic eu logo. In my view it's not deceiving customers if I explain the product is certiefied Japan organic. Then it's surely their choice, right? It's just annoying there isn't a more efficient system set up between these countries. The £45 fee per order really hits hard for SMEs."

worldnews,eoe0afo,t1_eod6dsi,1558485202.0,"Again, a tangent, but I disagree strongly that ""carving exceptions"" is an example of playing politics. On the contrary, I think it is important to note these issues are NOT black and white. That's exactly why late-stage abortions during 21st to 24th week of gestation are frowned upon more than early ones. 

Similarly, it clearly *does* make a difference in how the human being was created, at least if you consider the importance of environment in upbringing. You cannot compare the upbringing of a child born from rape to the upbringing of a child from an unwanted pregnancy who may have two loving parents. Of course, the same logic can be applied to why abortions do make sense if two people cannot commit to the responsibility of being a parent."
