No.

Even old people can change. It just becomes harder for them, in most cases, definitely not impossible. The difference in anybody who wants to change vs. somebody who doesn't is in their ability for honest self-reflection, desire, and willpower.

The primary issue isn't his age, it's **him**. From the time he was young until the present day, he simply had (and still has) no interest in changing anything about himself because he's convinced he's superior to others, either inherently or because he was born into wealth.

There's no desire, and he can't self-reflect because he'd get too defensive at the thought of anything about himself being sub-optimal. He has no willpower, because he can't buckle down and power through when things become stressful to him, even for things he *wants*, much less for things he doesn't give a crap about.

Plus, if I'm not misremembering, Hojo refers to Sephiroth the same way one might refer to an thing or object one possesses at least once throughout the game's events in the Japanese script (though not in that scene, I don't think), which possibly raises the question of whether or not Hojo simply considers Sephiroth 'his' in the way he considers experiments his own doing or if they're indeed biologically related.

What a bizarre choice not to go for even more tragedy, and I really want them to change that for Remake too.

For whatever it's worth, there was this exchange still in the OG:

> [Cloud] Sephiroth is your son!?

> [Vincent] ......!

Lucrecia generally distanced herself from Vincent and eventually married Hojo. And Vincent already knew/noticed that. So what reason would he have, exactly, to be surprised when Hojo states 'Sephiroth is my son'? ...Unless Vincent thought he could've been 'responsible' for Sephiroth?

I mean, if someone marries a person, it wouldn't be weird to think they've been involved for a while. So unless something else was plausible, why would he be all ""... ...!"" toward Hojo effectively stating 'the woman I married had a kid and it's mine'? There's exactly zero reason Vincent should be surprised about Hojo claiming he's Sephiroth's father in that case unless he considered something else plausible (or some lightbulb went off in his head). 

So I think there's still ostensibly some wiggle room to say that Sephiroth is biologically related to Vincent. Whether or not Square would go there is another matter, though.

And, while I think this is a greater supposition on my part to make, there was also this line:

> [Vincent] ......

> I was...wrong. The one that should have slept was...

> ...You, Hojo!

When Vincent says 'sleep', he's obviously referring to the decades when he sequestered himself to the basement coffin after his [perceived or actual] failings or ""sins"" in the mess with Hojo and Lucrecia). If he had been assuming Sephiroth was his the whole time that would have added another twist of the knife to not being able to stop things.

Plus, in the Japanese script, if memory serves correctly, Hojo used the construction ""-の物"" to refer to Sephiroth before. The second character means ""thing"" (as used to refer to objects) and he's using a possessive. Hojo could just be presuming that Sephiroth is his, or considering him 'his' because he was the one who was able to 'create' him (in a sense) through his experimentations.

And then there's the fact that in the Early Material Files (scenes and ideas that were ultimately cut or changed in the final product of Final Fantasy VII), Vincent's section mentions that Lucrecia was originally ""on Vincent's side"", drugged by Hojo, and forced into experimentation against her will. She submitted consensually (or ""consensually"", as the case may be) to Jenova testing in the final product. Plus, her name is Lucrecia, a name that could easily be a reference to the Roman figure Lucretia. Who was raped by Sextus Tarquinius. :l

For starters, most of the Pokemon models (excepting the Pokemon newly created for this, obviously) came from previous games. The models created for the 3DS games were 'future-proofed' by Creatures Inc. (who first created the models) specifically so that GameFreak could still use the models for later consoles that were well beyond the 3DS' abilities. They were downscaled significantly for use on the 3DS.

https://youtu.be/YQNaQtxisWo

This particular topic is already a dead horse, but SwSh trees are awfully close to OoT's (1998) and not far removed from Spyro's either (. But regardless of whether you do or don't consider them N64/PSX-grade, I really don't think it can be argued that the trees look like they belong in any game that came out in the past 13 years or so at least, and that's being *generous*, since all but perhaps the laziest games dating back to 2006 would've left the trees in SwSh in the dust. Heck, if you look at the trees in the background of Relic Forest when purifying a Pokemon in Colosseum (2003, NGC), *those* look better than SwSh's trees, and that wasn't a game known for its graphics.

> Not having access generation is a clever spin expect for Stadium came out when there was only one generation of Pokemon I believe.

Sure, but that's still 151 Pokemon worth of work, which they had to do from the ground up*. And Stadium 2 had 251 Pokemon in it (giving them a workload of 100 new 'mons).

For SwSh, the fact is that the work for the old Pokemon was largely already done -- so when you consider the newly created Pokemon (including Galarian forms, since those have their own designs) you're left with only 94 Pokemon to manage in around one-to-two years (production on SwSh began not long after SuMo finished, but it's unclear when they started working on new Pokemon).

And this isn't even getting into move animations...while Stadium and Stadium 2 had to create those from scratch and there were 165 and 86 moves introduced in each of their respective gens, most of which were unique, SwSh reuses much of the move animations that the past couple of gens. used, and also opts to outright remove over 70 moves.

(*Technically 109 or thereabouts, since there was a Japan-only release of Pokemon Stadium before the one we got here in the west, which only included 42 Pokemon of the original 151. Also goes to show, it's not as if rushing the games and leaving things aside is entirely new in the franchise...but even then, they actually tweaked and in some cases outright redid a number of those Pokemon's models, hit animations, and move animations, along with stadium backgrounds, trophy designs, and trainer portraits, for the Stadium that had the complete 151)."

I'd argue that it doesn't have a 'better version of Stadium built in', since it doesn't have all the Pokemon relative to its generation and no announcer. It *does* have a single player (more accurately, a game with a plot), but that's been true of literally every main series game in the franchise, plus several of the side series games (like Colosseum and XD)

> People are comparing it to a rather weak kick animation and claiming Stadium somehow had more time put into it.

The *animations*, at least, do have more time/effort placed into them. The .gif and the original post and other videos (such as of the fainting animations) show it. SwSh have more going for them in some other regards, clearly, but its move and 'mon animations aren't among the things it trumps Stadium at. And it's a bit more embarrassing of a situation for SwSh, considering rigging was more arduous back then then now.

I was born in '95, but my gaming experience for a not-insignificant chunk of my youth was NES/SNES/N64 as well, since my family is poor. SwSh's lighting and most textures are definitely better than such old systems (among other things), but the trees were absolutely N64-grade and the amount of [pop-in](https://imgur.com/gallery/16morpW) and clipping is a lot closer to N64/PSX era than it is to most modern games...the draw distance is definitely not on par with other offerings of this console gen."

I get it's a joke, but people take it as an actual, educational joke like it's a man yelling at the sea, and that's just wrong. Furthermore, these things have an actual impact on discussions about conservation efforts---If every time Koalas get brought up, someone posts this copypasta, that means it's seriously shaping public opinion about the animal and their supposed lack of importance.

> Speaking of stupidity and food, one of the likely reasons for their primitive brains is the fact that additionally to being poisonous, eucalyptus leaves (the only thing they eat) have almost no nutritional value. They can't afford the extra energy to think, they sleep more than 80% of their fucking lives.

Non-ecologists always talk this way, and the problem is you’re looking at this backwards. An entire continent is covered with Eucalyptus trees. They suck the moisture out of the entire surrounding area and use allelopathy to ensure that most of what’s beneath them is just bare red dust. No animal is making use of them——they have virtually no herbivore predator. A niche is empty. Then inevitably, natural selection fills that niche by creating an animal which can eat Eucalyptus leaves. Of course, it takes great sacrifice for it to be able to do so——it certainly can’t expend much energy on costly things. Isn’t it a good thing that a niche is being filled?

> Koalas are no exception, when their teeth erode down to nothing, they resolve the situation by starving to death

This applies to all herbivores, because the wild is not a grocery store—where meat is just sitting next to celery. Herbivores gradually wear their teeth down—carnivores fracture their teeth, and break their bones in attempting to take down prey. They have one of the smallest brain to body ratios of any mammal It's pretty typical of herbivores, and is higher than many, many species. According to Ashwell (2008), their encephalisation quotient is 0.5288 +/- 0.051. Higher than comparable marsupials like the wombat (~0.52), some possums (~0.468), cuscus (~0.462) and even some wallabies are <0.5. According to wiki, rabbits are also around 0.4, and they're placental mammals. additionally - 

> their brains are smooth. A brain is folded to increase the surface area for neurons.

Again, this is not unique to koalas. Brain folds (gyri) are not present in rodents, which we consider to be incredibly intelligent for their size.

> If you present a koala with leaves plucked from a branch, laid on a flat surface, the koala will not recognise it as food.

If you present a human with a random piece of meat, they will not recognize it as food (hopefully). Fresh leaves might be important for koala digestion, especially since their gut flora is clearly important for the digestion of Eucalyptus. It might make sense not to screw with that gut flora by eating decaying leaves.

> Because eucalyptus leaves hold such little nutritional value, koalas have to ferment the leaves in their guts for days on end. Unlike their brains, they have the largest hind gut to body ratio of any mammal.

That's an extremely weird reason to dislike an animal. But whilst we're talking about their digestion, let's discuss their poop. It's delightful. It smells like a Eucalyptus drop!

> Being mammals, koalas raise their joeys on milk (admittedly, one of the lowest milk yields to body ratio... There's a trend here).

Marsupial milk is incredibly complex and much more interesting than any placentals. This is because they raise their offspring essentially from an embryo, and the milk needs to adapt to the changing needs of a growing fetus. And yeah, of course the yield is low; at one point they are feeding an animal that is half a gram!

> When the young joey needs to transition from rich, nourishing substances like milk, to eucalyptus (a plant that seems to be making it abundantly clear that it doesn't want to be eaten), it finds it does not have the necessary gut flora to digest the leaves. To remedy this, the young joey begins nuzzling its mother's anus until she leaks a little diarrhoea (actually fecal pap, slightly less digested), which he then proceeds to slurp on. This partially digested plant matter gives him just what he needs to start developing his digestive system.

Humans probably do this, we just likely do it during childbirth. You know how women often shit during contractions? There is evidence to suggest that this innoculates a baby with her gut flora. A child born via cesarian has significantly different gut flora for the first six months of life than a child born vaginally.

> Of course, he may not even have needed to bother nuzzling his mother. She may have been suffering from incontinence. Why? Because koalas are riddled with chlamydia. In some areas the infection rate is 80% or higher.

Chlamydia was introduced to their populations by humans. We introduced a novel disease that they have very little immunity to, and is a major contributor to their possible extinction. Do you hate Native Americans because they were killed by smallpox and influenza?

> This statistic isn't helped by the fact that one of the few other activities koalas will spend their precious energy on is rape. Despite being seasonal breeders, males seem to either not know or care, and will simply overpower a female regardless of whether she is ovulating. If she fights back, he may drag them both out of the tree

Almost every animal does this.

> which brings us full circle back to the brain: Koalas have a higher than average quantity of cerebrospinal fluid in their brains. This is to protect their brains from injury... should they fall from a tree. An animal so thick it has its own little built in special ed helmet. I fucking hate them.

Argument not over. The medical field determines death by brain activity (or rather, a relative lack of) -- if one's brainwaves as shown on an EEG are below a certain threshold of activity and regularity, then one is medically dead. Neither cessation of heartbeat or breathing is the cutoff for clinical death; you could forcefully keep one's heart (or lungs or many other organs) functional, but it would be neither here nor there, because brain death *is* death, and the function of other organs is ultimately fruitless if the brain no longer meets a minimum standard of activity.

Relatedly, a fetus doesn't reach that bare minimum threshold until around ~24 weeks or so. Which is effectively already where viability is set.

His chin's not as prominent as the average 'western' dude's, so I assume that's part of why people give him a hard time about it, but he's hardly hideous (physically), and I suspect if his chin wasn't serving as the 'low-hanging' fruit, they'd just shift to something else.

Also, you're a woman, right? A small chin isn't such a major deal to most if you're not a guy, in my experience. My own chin is pretty tiny and non-prominent (courtesy of my mom) and I more or less inherited my Dad's 'Cleopatra/Roman nose' (--further bolstered by getting decked in the face with a milk jug full of rocks that some kid threw at me as a kid), and my teeth are kind of gnarled, but my chin, at least, hasn't been something people have ignored or slagged me over.

Maybe take it gradually and see how things go once your teeth are done, or maybe the nose job? And...I don't want this to come out the wrong way, but are you sure the lack of attention isn't due to the insecurity, at least in part? I find that when I sink down and get mired in the idea of my hideousness, people in general -- even strangers -- just don't notice me as much and don't show any hint of romantic interest.

If you were a higher-up in a company and you cajoled a lower-level employee into giving you a blow job, you could get charged with sexual assault. Why? Because some undesirable consequence, such as fear of loss for their job, would be considered to hang over the less powerful employee's head should they refuse. That holds true even if the more powerful person never *explicitly* made the threat against the other person's job.

To be more specific to this situation with the therapist, medical professionals (and this extends to therapists) are not allowed to make advances on their patients (nor date them, even if they had the patient's 'consent') for similar reasons -- the physical and/or mental vulnerability of their patients, combined with inappropriate attachment on the part of the medical professional is considered to result in too high of a risk of negatively impacting the patient's quality of care, considered non-consensual on the part of the patient as they are likely to not be in a proper frame of mind to truly give it, and it's a breach of ethics and sexual misconduct (if not outright assault) from the medical professional who is supposed to avoid inappropriate attachments to their clients -- that includes displaying sexual interest, for the record.

People were still largely afraid of touching (or sometimes even just being *near*) someone with HIV or AIDS at the time, despite researchers knowing by that point that those things weren't actual health threats.
