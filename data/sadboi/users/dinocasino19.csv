TooAfraidToAsk,f069zoo,t3_d4041v,1568433073.0,"From my understanding (I have an ftm friend), this is a common question and is often misunderstood. I wouldn’t consider this a heterosexual relationship at all as they both present as male. 

Some trans relationships like this will take part in heterosexual sex but my friend says this idea makes him personally uncomfortable but he has friends that enjoy penetrative sex with biological males while they are ftm. It’s personal preference and comfort that determine this. 

Long story short, the sexual side of the relationship MIGHT be heterosexual by nature but the relationship is definitely not and should be respected as a gay relationship (unless of course this label makes the two upset)

My advice: labels are great but sometimes aren’t necessary. Your friends are in a relationship and that’s all that matters, no matter if it’s straight or not!"

There’s no vape device or cartridge that is necessarily GOOD for you. A lot of the medical problems I’ve seen in the news are from teens who have parents that “never knew timmy was vaping” when in reality the kid probably goes through a few cartridges a day.  I don’t recommend vaping or smoking but I think if you do it in moderation and keep talking to your doctor, you won’t end up in the news for a serious health problem."
