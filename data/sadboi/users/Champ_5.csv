miamidolphins,foglb29,t3_g7dt8h,1587754038.0,"We don't need to put the injury prone future of the franchise out there behind a line that will certainly be improved but will probably still have issues.

Let him learn and make sure he's fully healed before he goes out there. There's a lot riding on him.

Besides, as good as Tua may become, I don't think he immediately gives us a better shot to win than Fitzpatrick. Fitz is far from a perfect QB, but he has experience, especially behind not-so-great lines. And he's shown he can play very well for stretches. Tua will need time to learn the system, see the speed of the NFL, etc. He won't give them a better chance to win right away."

miamidolphins,foc3tll,t1_foc1zvm,1587666794.0,"If it were one extra pick, sure. But it will be more than that, maybe significantly more if other teams are trying to move up. And the team has so many holes to fill. Five wins was overachieving last season. It's made people think the team is in better shape than it is. They're not sneaking up on anyone next year. They need a lot of help, and need the picks to get that help."
miamidolphins,foc38og,t1_foc1rmd,1587666600.0,"True, but they're in a bad division and he doesn't get full credit for the SB. I do think Wentz is good, if he stays healthy. The others... not so much. I thought Goff was going to be good, but doubting that now."

- The injuries. Especially the hip. People are dismissing it too easily. Maybe it will be fine somehow. And maybe he'll never be the same again.

- Size, or lack thereof.

- Surrounded by the best talent at Bama. Things will be more even in the pros.

- Family situation.  Normally not something I would be concerned about, but in conjunction with the other issues, it may be reason for pause.

If they absolutely must take him, please for the love of god just do it at 5 and don't try to trade up. One high pick is enough to gamble on this guy."

Some people probably don't mind experiencing things alone, but I've always felt almost all experiences are better shared. And what bigger, more important experience is there than life?

I just don't think this is the right situation for that.

Parker has had one good year and several disappointing ones. Just because the one good year was most recent doesn't all of a sudden make him elite. He needs to duplicate that effort and then we can talk.

Williams has injury concerns and more to prove. 

I dont think either one of those guys are true #1's for a really good team. 

The rest of them are aggressively average. I certainly hope they can show more this season, but there's nothing besides hope to say that's going to happen."

Those are valid points, but it's also valid that when you're trying to completely rebuild a franchise, 1st and second round picks should be treated like gold. Those are potential immediate impact players for a team that needs many. Yes, QB is one of those needs as well, yes, the most important need. But that doesn't mean the other needs dont exist.

If you have the opportunity to select that many high round players to fill a large amount of needs, I say that's the way to go."

I like it for that reason, and always will. Other Star Trek movies surpassed it after watching them numerous times and just growing to really like them. But 5 will always be that memory for me.
