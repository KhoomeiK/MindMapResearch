I keep producing plenty of milk (breastfeeding exclusively) with 4 days a week at 1200 calories, 2 days intermittent fasting of 20 hours (calories intake about 800), and one day at maintenance.

(just go slow and see what your body can handle) if one day you seem to have a little too little. Eat!

Decrease in milk supply happens slowly in my experience so it's easy to see how much you really need.

Best of luck!"

It was really only a mental factor, as is for everyone, to decide that I absolutely wanted to lose the weight. I decided that I wanted to change my hard. Being fat is hard, losing/maintaining is hard.

I ate 1200 calories most days. Salad being the most popular dish for months.. Then I got looser and lost my way during a 2 month vacation where I gained 10 pounds.

Started intermittent fasting and one meal a day dealio. Just cuz otherwise Id eat too much in the day. Autumn / Winter blues are hard.

Honestly haven't weighed myself the last month because of factors such as my preschooler and I are constantly sick/ new job stress.
