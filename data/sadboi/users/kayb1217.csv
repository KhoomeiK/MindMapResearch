BPD,flotbxi,t3_fpqcd1,1585345061.0,I do this all the time on here and also with selfies I take. Its so annoying that I rely on others opinions of me to make me feel better.
BPD,fl95zdx,t1_fl95snq,1584942181.0,I get manic often but it only lasts like an hour at the most. Usually its triggered by stress too.
BPD,fkz1j7q,t1_fkz17hn,1584660725.0,"Thats how I feel. Everything Ive been through I believe is why I am the way I am but at the same time I constantly ask myself, was it really that bad or am I just overreacting"

BPD,fhfzha7,t1_fhfym2e,1581555013.0,"Yeah 90% of the time I cut/dye my hair its at night when I'm manic and think anything will look good lol. I also mostly change it when im having a breakdown cause maybe if i look good, I won't feel so suicidal?? 🙃 But taking pics is a good idea. Im trying to learn to just leave my hair be but its hard."

BPD,fdjf5n4,t3_elm39b,1578468194.0,"Yeah except not so much loving how I look. Sometimes I think Im pretty but if i stare at myself too long or pictures I take, i pick out all my flaws and yep back to hating myself and how i look. I also compare myself to every attractive person I see so thats fun."

BPD,f4nvn7x,t3_dl5piy,1571693543.0,"I was in the exact same place as you man. I recently quit my job because I was dreading going to work and having so much anxiety over it, I was having trouble sleeping as well. I quit after like 16 days because it just wasn't the job for me but like you said, everyone was so proud of me too and I felt like a failure when I quit but I'm honestly so relieved because the job I had put so much stress on me emotionally and physically, I woke up and had a panic attack at 5am the day I had to go to work. I'm not saying you should quit and no I dont think anyone is really supposed to like their job but if it's making you miserable, your mental health is more important and I'd find a job that you're more comfortable with but I know it can be very hard also."

mentalillness,exg5ty9,t1_exg5i25,1566256148.0,Honestly sometimes they do feel real which sends me into a full blown panic attack. I tell myself they’re not but sometimes it doesn’t help.
mentalillness,exf1eba,t1_exf08a6,1566230412.0,It’s good to know I’m not the only one dealing with this shit..I hope we both can overcome these thoughts.
mentalillness,exf1b2i,t1_exezuf5,1566230352.0,Thank you for such a detailed response. I keep telling myself that it’s not real over and over but sometimes it very difficult..I used to be on antipsychotics but I stopped taking them because I didn’t want to change who I am but maybe I need to.
Drugs,exbhk0u,t1_exa71z6,1566131367.0,"I’ve seen the bad, ugly side of this drug.. I’ve seen a pregnant woman use knowing she had a life inside of her because her addiction was that bad. My boyfriend and myself, and my brother all turned into different people..mean, heartless, suicidal people. I’ve seen how bad the addiction to it is and it almost took my boyfriends life the other day....Please, PLEASE if you can stay as far away from this drug as possible.

mentalillness,evqj3ms,t1_evqi2vw,1564693175.0,Thank you so much for commenting. I’ve been to several therapists but I never seem to stick with one because I don’t get along with them or don’t like what they tell me. I’ve also taken abilify in the past which seemed to help the mood swings but I stopped taking it as I didn’t want to change who I am. I might have to go back on it though. I will look into Dialectical Behavior Therapy.
death,evod3su,t3_cj1wah,1564643833.0,You had me at “die”
ParanormalEncounters,evi46t4,t1_evi2v1c,1564536755.0,Yeah I do agree with you. What would you suggest would be a better way to communicate with these entities or should we just leave them alone? I just want to know what is living with us as I have always been interested in the paranormal and the afterlife.  Also my boyfriend has an uncle and a grandfather who have passed away. What are the chances that it could be one of them? I feel like there are definitely multiple spirits here though.
ParanormalEncounters,evi0kqt,t1_evhzc8z,1564535108.0,Thank you for replying! Yeah I agree that it does sound like it could be a malevolent spirit. My boyfriends family got the property cheap because it was Native American Land. We literally live next to a place called Indian Mound. I’ve thought of digging in various places on the property to see if there is still bones under ground but I don’t know where to start. Every time I use our spirit box the same female voice comes through that sounds distressed but we can’t get any solid answers. Also the basement has the most activity it seems.
