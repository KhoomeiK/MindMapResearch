My G.I. doctor suggested it a while ago but it just seems like such a pain in the ass I haven’t wanted to. For sure avoiding onions really helps me but I want to figure out what else I’m sensitive to.
bulimia,fiaolzk,t3_f7at0x,1582305337.0," Early recovery is so tough! Stick with it. Allow your body to do whatever it needs to to heal and re-nourish :-) do anything you can to promote self love and acceptance right now. Make a list of things you can do to make yourself feel good. For me that list includes baths, massages, good movies. 

I had a really hard time digesting normal food for a few months and would get pregnant looking with bloating it was so hard to stay abstinent during these times but I’m so glad I did. Realizing I was going to be uncomfortable physically and emotionally as part of the process really help me to get through it."
Topamax,fh538z0,t1_fh0eudw,1581284634.0,I’m off it 2.5 days now but have  taken probiotics this started. Limited gassy foods. I think it’s water. Dandelion seems to help but then bam stomach will be huge again. Maybe salt.

Topamax,fgv6kxn,t3_eeskrl,1581138660.0,I used it to get in recovery from bulimia. It helped with binge urges. 2 years later I was the subject of a study on a rare water metabolism disorder. I was peeing out 6L every 24 hours and constantly drinking to catch up. After many outpatient visits and 3 days in the hospital they decided it was topomax ! so I weaned myself down to a 1/2 dose and now after major bloating I’m getting off it. it serves it’s purpose and it’s time to let go.

It doesn’t have to be MRI. I’m looking for a job in the medical field that is rewarding and pays well with good job prospects that doesn’t require a highly impacted/competitive program or wait list. Open to all ideas."
MRI,ffb5ixt,t1_ffb4lj5,1579752349.0,Thank you! I would do radiology if the waiting lists weren’t so crazy. I have a masters in Exercise   Science I’d have to work my ass off on the material
eeg,ff9mlnb,t3_du4jug,1579716161.0,I’m really surprised to see online programs in this field but it’s so interesting to me and the time for entry so much faster than radiology around me because of prerequisites and impacting

Sonographers,ff9lynm,t3_eryuud,1579715783.0,It’s true The only thing around here is Santa Barbara city and a private program in LA Santa Barbara city isn’t even taking more applications

respiratorytherapy,ff6513w,t3_enaqed,1579619293.0,That’s really far for me only for profit here.
Radiology,ff643ba,t1_ff5p4yf,1579618631.0,Great info. Where I live PA school would be at least an hour and a half a commute which would kill me and even more competitive and prerequisites. After too many years flailing I just want to start school and end up with a good hourly wage ASAP.
respiratorytherapy,ff5bdm9,t3_eqpdxs,1579586097.0,Yikes! Thanks for sharing. This sounds like such a better fit for me than RN but I’m getting discouraged for sure. Other allied health jobs interest me but none as much as RT. And none of them pay as well. The process to get into nursing school is here is just so daunting and I’m not sure I’m a nurse fit. I like the idea of having a deeper level of knowledge of one organ system and less multi tasking patient care.
respiratorytherapy,fewerfn,t1_fevchty,1579409376.0,Way more RN for sure but many on here say jobs are not posted on boards but based on clinicals. Do you think different?
findapath,fedmr4x,t1_feargza,1579015317.0,Thank you I’ve thought about those LVN Just seems like it would have more opportunity
findapath,fecsb2f,t1_fe96qm3,1578982717.0,I think LVN might be it. Lots of options and faster to start without prerequisites but can’t figure out pay.

nursing,fdzs5r6,t3_en2uym,1578794522.0,That is so good to hear I love this forum! I live in Ventura County. PCMI is closest to me and  I think was 20 months but maybe it is part time. There are so many others I will definitely look.
nursing,fdyx0vd,t3_en2uym,1578784399.0,I know LVN’s work in hospitals at least with Kaiser in California but when I look online I really only see jobs in rehabs. Can LVN start out in the hospital?

Which bridge program did you do?"
nursing,fdyvw5k,t1_fdx7lq7,1578784100.0,The lack of prerequisites for sure works for me because I can start faster. I’m trying to get a good sense of LVN starting pay because the school is much more expensive
respiratorytherapy,fdwb9rx,t3_ejtsh0,1578756957.0,This is great. I’m thinking of RT vs Nursing but I’ll look up perfusion
respiratorytherapy,fdwax54,t3_elnutk,1578756874.0,Does RT at least have the flexibility of per Diem or part time? I’m deciding about going into nursing or RT at 43 but after a BA and MS that don’t meet any of the prerequisites the 2 semesters of prerequisites for nursing kill me. RT seems like a great option and I could just start.
Nurse,fdtljpb,t1_fds7hvw,1578718508.0,Thank you! My very good friend did too. They denied all my masters classes so I have zero of the prerequisites for that program :( Going to see if Moorpark will accept any if not then LVN privately might be what I do
nursing,fdtl9k5,t3_en2uym,1578718388.0,I’m so overwhelmed by how long the prerequisites will take :/
Nurse,fdre57u,t1_fc4om5a,1578683185.0,"I am loving this thread I’m in the same boat but 43 have thought about something in the medical field for 10 years. I was a pretty successful photographer but really crave the job satisfaction stability and higher hourly pay that I think nursing or one of the allied health professions will allow me. I get overwhelmed with the project of going back to school, prerequisites etc. but I’m a good student. I just wanna and roll already. Aaron seems that way to go but if I could find a good surgical tech program I would be out of school sooner with no P requisite‘s I just worry about the lack of job options and lower pay."

A lot of the time we just need to get sick and tired of beating ourselves up I think. No magic answer, pill, dr or meditation will beat just wanna to stop the behavior more than you want to give into it. Maybe ask yourself what does the binge promise? For me it was numbness. I hated feeling feelings. Until I was willing to feel I couldn’t stop."

sleep,fdd0cbh,t1_fd9yktr,1578289830.0,Omg longest process ever! Was in the hospital 3 days dehydrating myself before they decided it was a side effect of a med I take! Really frustrating but for now I’m tapering off that.
DiabetesInsipidus,fc0gmiw,t1_f8a898j,1577290407.0,It was awful! My CT was normal. My water deprivation test was strange. I peed out 10 lbs over the first 10 hours and just kept peeing and with very dilute urine but my serum sodium wasn’t really going up. As I understand it a normal person would concentrate urine must faster than I did but someone would classic DI would not concentrate at all. I concentrated around 40 hours so they stop testing. So I’m not a classic DI but did not have a normal response. Back to my dr Jan 6 who is a specialist in water metabolism.

DiabetesInsipidus,f8675i3,t1_f85mwfm,1574291365.0,A normal response to lack of water would be concentration of urine would go up. In DI patients osmality stays low.
EatingDisorders,f86726w,t3_dz0dhm,1574291301.0,Your husband needs education from a therapist or even a good book and you need therapy and nutrition.

ANAD also has a mentorship program.
DiabetesInsipidus,f85fzsu,t3_dx10oo,1574274435.0,My pee varies from clear to straw. It’s the volume that was unique. My primary didn’t have a clue. She sent me to an endocrinologist and rheumatologist. The endocrinologist was also clueless only testing me for diabetes mellitus. I self referred to a nephrologist who finally did a 24 hr urine test which revealed some clues.

EatingDisorders,f6vm3r0,t3_dq1xao,1573190648.0,"Such a brave post thank you.

Your metabolism will take a while to adjust to the new less exercise amount. ED plus exercise can cause a hypermetabolic state as well. Hunger is a signal to EAT, it’s hard but listen. The body knows what you need. Probably food and rest for a while. I was training for ultramarathons while fully engaged in bulimia. I ended up not able to train or run at all but starving as my body was desperate to rebuild. Oh man I did not want to feed it because I wasn’t running!!! I get it."

EatingDisorders,f6vl1dv,t3_dsekwq,1573189555.0,"Eventually it will mean eating when you are hungry and stopping when you are full but a dietician will help you with a baby steps plan to getting there. Structured eating meal plans help most people because our normal cues are so screwed up. A good dietician will write a plan that doesn’t further trigger your perfectionism or obsession or stress you out. 
 It does take a lot of trust so find someone you like. You could always pm someone HEALTHY on here and ask for help in sharing their meal plan until your appointment. 3 meals and 2 snacks was always my plan. The only thing different now is that I don’t always need snacks between meals but I do usually have something with me. I am aware of my hunger and satiety and energy now which feels like freedom.

Happy to share more details privately. I’m in recovery from anorexia and bulimia. Getting a food plan and following it really helped get me started. Getting too hungry or under eating will always be a trigger so a solid meal plan is a good first step."
bulimia,f6rgv2l,t3_dsb52u,1573103569.0,I have found this to be the case when I am underweight or under eating. The better I am eating and healthier my weight  the less food has hold over me.
