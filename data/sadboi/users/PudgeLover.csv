BuddyCrossing,fqhhut9,t1_fqhhd8x,1589377309.0,Really? Is it because it takes time and you can’t buy it at the store?
BuddyCrossing,fqhh3xh,t1_fqhgpkg,1589376872.0,Hmm ok. I’ve only been playing for a little over a week and I feel like I haven’t done much to my island... But it’s so expensive to do things. I have another question... can you move more than one house/building at a time or is it like the incline/bridge thing where it’s one a day?
BuddyCrossing,fqhezch,t1_fqhekyh,1589375572.0,"Hmmm ok that’s really helpful... Now I know why someone gave me a lot of their native fruit to sell. I have all the fruits growing into trees but I didn’t think they could make a lot of money. 

I’ve visited lots of islands to water so I could see what I like/don’t like. So far I’d prefer just accessibility to things without needing a ladder and pole. I liked the idea of flower patches and section for a neighborhood. Does the island get bigger? Or does it just look bigger because of how people did their islands?"
BuddyCrossing,fqhe0g7,t1_fqhdpfk,1589374959.0,"Well I know I want to put all the residents in one area and currently Pashmina’s house is where I was going to put the shop. As far as the museum goes idk where to put it... also I don’t have Mabel’s yet... Does terraforming affect bridges and inclines? 

You can still make a lot of money off of the fruit even though you are now growing them on your island? Because I have a few nonnative trees growing from some people that let me have their fruit."
BuddyCrossing,fqhdew8,t1_fqhd2c5,1589374572.0,Ok that was my first thought but I was worried I’d have to redo it later. I found out how long everything takes and the one infrastructure rule a day and figured I should think it through. Would you say it’s best to just put all the shop/museum/campsite on the main island and then move the resident to an easy spot but away from the services?
BuddyCrossing,fqhd7kh,t1_fqhd0al,1589374442.0,Hmm ok. I guess I’ll just move them for my needs now and redo it later. I imagine later it might be easier to get money fast. I just threw everything down quickly to advance in the game and now it’s difficult to see certain things and get to places.

intj,fo31f2t,t3_g5ed5h,1587478693.0,"Bumble. We’ve been dating 3 years this year. I’m too awkward and shy to go out and such. Plus I don’t like the whole bar/club thing. My boyfriend is also an introvert and said he wouldn’t have asked me out in person if he had seen me because he would’ve been intimidated. 

Personally I think meeting a SO online is best when you are introverted... it’s just easier."
Anxiety,fo2z8lt,t1_fo2ctab,1587477428.0,"I’m sorry you still have to go through this. I ended up moving out probably too quickly financially but just being able to breathe and have a safe home felt worth it. 

You are not weak. I feel like it’s normal to make to run away (flight response) but that’s probably cause I’ve been there. I still leave whenever a man raises his voice. I’ve had an anxiety attack and cried in a parking lot because my former landlord was yelling and she was a woman. I just don’t do well with loud noises especially from a man though. When my boyfriend raises his voice (which is rarely) I’ll tell hey you are scaring me please lower your voice. Usually he’s raises his voice because he’s upset at someone else never me but it still raises my anxiety."
Anxiety,fo1fee5,t3_g4lqtq,1587432103.0,"I basically grew up the same as you. I couldn’t and still can’t deal with men raising their voice let alone full on yelling. I had to leave my parent’s house because I couldn’t deal with constant stress/worry/fear that something would set my stepdad off. So after being with my boyfriend for barely 6 months I moved out and into a place with him. I can’t tell you the amount of relief I have from not living their anymore. I may have a different stress/fear (being financially independent-> money) but it’s definitely better in my personal experience in comparison to what I was living with.

Side note: Definitely not stupid. Also, it’s considered abuse. It is not ok for your dad or your brother to behave like that. Hang in there."
Anxiety,fo1cvo9,t3_g552hn,1587430545.0,"Well this whole pandemic situation is a good example in my opinion. At first everyone was freaking out and it seemed to me like me and other people I know that have anxiety took it way better than most people. 

Anxiety gives you all of the worse case scenarios so you prepare for them no matter how ridiculous they seem. 

In my case I’m more aware of my surroundings when I’m out and about. I’ll be walking with a family member or boyfriend and notice something or someone suspicious and they hadn’t even noticed. Meanwhile, I’ve been watching everything me to determine whether or not that thing/person should be deemed suspicious."

running,flsgmhx,t1_flscv0h,1585441676.0,"I made a social media group for my area but not a lot of people are on it. I just like going through this thread, reading about running, and talking about running bc it can be motivating. I’m like “oh yeah that’s what I love about it! Now I want to go run.”

Yes it is very empowering!"
running,flsbo6k,t3_fquspv,1585438564.0,"My suggestion would be finding out why you loved running in the first place. I’ve run with no motivation after being lazy for weeks bc it was a nice sunny day and then I realized “ah yes this is why I love running”.  

After figuring it out use it to go run. Run whenever you can, with/without motivation and eventually it’ll be an addiction. 

You may be quarantined/social distancing but you can still talk with other runners online/phone. If they were your source of accountability maybe each of you sends a picture saying “hey I ran today” or join a Facebook running group where people do check ins like that. I’m not extroverted so I definitely not understand this struggle but I do know that whenever my mom sends me a picture of her run or texts me that she ran I feel guilty if I haven’t. 


Don’t know if any of this helps but I tried... 😬"
Anxiety,fleesg3,t1_fle0cbq,1585083005.0,Yes. Doesn’t help. I get anxious about trying to make it “perfect” or I have trouble deciding on colors.
Anxiety,fle0a7v,t3_fo6h6w,1585075162.0,Yes! Plus I have asthma so I’m definitely not a stranger to the inability to breathe. I have to keep telling myself that it’s highly unlikely that I have the virus considering I usually only leave my house for work (I work alone too) or other essential reasons anyways.
Anxiety,fl2cxy0,t3_fm23mg,1584748160.0,Not sure if this counts... but I’ve had a really bad anxiety attack before where I was in so much pain I left the room I was in and went to my (ex) boyfriend’s bed and just curled up into the fetal position basically. Next thing I knew he was in the room and said I had passed out/fell asleep. I guess the pain/anxiety was just too much for my body and it just shut down.

I only say that knowing that all that traffic is going somewhere and I’ve cleaned up after partying. But like someone else said the island will be “quieter”.
