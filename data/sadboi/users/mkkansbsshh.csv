SuicideWatch,ewhsjer,t1_ewhi6t9,1565420260.0,"Oooh a Florida resident! The land of humidity, alligators and strange headlines. XD 190 degrees is absolutely insane. I cant imagine going outside in that weather, not to mention having to deal with kids at the same time. Your middle one probably is not too thrilled with his birthday/ first day of school coincidence. 

Ahhh Zucchini nut bread reminds me of one year when I was little, and my mother planted zucchinis in our garden. But she planned maybe 10 of them, expecting one or two zucchinis per plant over the summer. But there were SO MANNY - we started giving them away to neighbors, moms coworkers, relatives and friends. 
And still, we ate a lot of zucchini that Summer so Mum had to get creative to make the omnipresent squash palatable for every meal. She made zucchini nut bread quite a bit. That summer later became known as ‚ÄúThe Zucchini Wars‚Äù. XD All my good memories seem to be from before I was 10 haha. Anyways, forgive my tangent. 

Mediterranean and Italian foods are üëåThey are pretty high on my list too haha. 

And ahhh, i know that pain of beingthe annoying one‚Äù. I am also trying to take a step back from my friendships and make sure im not coming off as too clingy or nagging. It hurts yet i think its needed. A lot of what you said about working on yourself just rings so true for me too. I both want to work harder, and improve myself, but I also get so tired and overwhelmed that i just want to end it all. 

And yknow, im shit at comfort. But i do know a little bit about kids - parents have to really, *really*, *REALLY*, fuck up for kids to dislike em. As in, even physically abusive parents are still loved by their kids. And the loving way you talk about them, Im pretty sure your little ones have all the love for you in the world. You might not be a perfect mother, and many may be ‚Äòbetter‚Äô and more patient than you. But still, you are *their* mom, and they love you for it. 

And i cant pretend to understand the pain and illnesses you have to deal with. Its so much more than ive ever had on my plate, and it sounds like a real, fucking pain in the ass. And back, haha. I hope everything goes well for you, and you gain a way to live life to the fullest even with those conditions. 

Its ok that you just spoke out like that, it happens and tbh its nice when ppl read and reply to that kind of thing, and this was the sort of question where it fit as an answer. Id write more, but my eyes are closing as i type.

I would say getting a little irritated over *ten years* is justified though - we have been quite patient. Im quite aware that the man is very talented and in reality i could produce nothing like his work. Thats WHY im irritated - I love and respect his work, and would like more of it. If I didn‚Äôt admire and enjoy his work I would care. 

The only reason I complain is because Rothfus seems to be lazy, not working on a piece of ‚Äòart‚Äô as you call it. He got a lot of money, and now he doesn‚Äôt have to write in order to survive and make money, so the motivation is gone. I dont blame him - ita a human thing to do and we all do it. I love painting, but sometimes the apathy just gets to me sometimes and i don‚Äôt create anything for years at a time.... 

Now i get that Rothfus is more of an artist than me in any sense of the word, and he may have some inner drive to push himself into creation. But so far we have seen nothing, he has made no discernible progress. At one time he has even destroyed one manuscript in a fit of perfectionism. 

He may be an author and all, but its unfair of him to string us all along saying there will be another book when it looks like he will kick the bucket before then. Better for him to admit he cant do it and just give a synopsis."
