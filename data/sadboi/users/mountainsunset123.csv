Futurology,fnsoxnq,t3_g3kdir,1587225995.0,"What about us retirees who work because our retirement isn't enough to live on? My Social Security is $812 a month. I also get food stamps. I also have a rental subsidy. 

Reapplying for food stamps every six months is stupid. Reapplying for my rental subsidy is humiliating. The amount of money wasted by the government on paperwork is astounding. 

I also get a medical subsidy to pay everything that Medicare doesn't cover. I have to reapply every six months. 

I was working part time before the shut down and my hours varied. Food stamps, Medicaid, and housing all seem to have difficulties with the concept of part time hourly work. They get annoyed when I can't predict what my paychecks will be. Some months I make $300 some months I make $600. Every once in awhile I make $700. But usually I make around $400+-. I can't tell you how many times I get a phone call and they want to know what hours days and rate of pay. Even though I have already given them copies of my pay stubs. They don't like it that I sometimes get fewer hours and then get more hours. They want to know how much I will be expecting to make in the next 30 days. I don't know. 

I don't know. They don't like that. I am not the only one working part time hours, that vary. I know I'm not. 

I am supposed to report any changes within ten days. I do and they get annoyed. My case causes them to produce extra paperwork. Not my fault. I had a worker one time tell me to not bother reporting unless I started making over a certain amount regularly. So I went six months without reporting changes because the changes were below the amount she stated. Ahhh did I get a lecture the next time I applied! I now report all changes. I have an over payment I am paying off now. 

My rent goes up and down depending on my income. My Food stamps go up and down depending on my income and my rent. My Medicaid could disappear if I make too much. Then my Medicare costs me more.
