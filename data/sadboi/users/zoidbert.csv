*The rebels are mulling over the events that just transpired on Crait; in hiding on the forest moon of Endor. It is night, and they are huddled around a fire.*

Finn (to Rey): What will you do? I mean; you've got power; skills. But who will complete your training?

Leia smiles, turning towards the darkness.

A voice from the darkness: I will.

Rey (almost without hope): How? All the Jedi are dead.

The voice responds, ""Child, I am no Jedi"", and a cloaked figure steps from the darkness, pulling back her hood, revealing that it is Ahsoka Tano."
