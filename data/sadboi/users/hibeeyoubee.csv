This said, I trust our government and I trust our  ""Trusts"" (local health authorities are called Trusts) to do the very best they can with what they are given.
There may be contingencies in place that I'm not aware of. I know we have been told not to worry and we will be provided for to the best they are able.

One message I think we need to get out there though..
DO NOT ATTEND HOSPITAL NEEDLESSLY!! ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE AN UNDERLYING RESPIRATORY DISEASE. 

Also, I'm sorry to say, that alot of our time and resources get wasted unnecessarily by people walking into A&E without good reason. Youd be surprised!!!!

 Also, if you have ""risky"" hobbies, please wait (till our health crisis is over) please dont give us extra work to deal with to satisfy a whim... enough said!

This would be my personal advise/opinion. 
Just sayin"

It's making me so miserable.
I'm so sorry that it didnt work out for you. I think you maybe better suited to a dog. Your a dogs whole world/life and they love their owners with total devotion, where as cats take a long time to love you, my cat, that passed, was my world and I miss her everyday💔💔💔💔💔.
