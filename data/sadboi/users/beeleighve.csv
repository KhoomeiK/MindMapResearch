depression,fotdn1q,t3_g9fkea,1588050926.0,"I've been on it for about 9 months (on-and-off because I'm bad at remembering to take them, plus they're expensive). My initial side effects were digestion issues. I feel like my appetite went up and I have gained weight, but I haven't seen anyone else experience the same thing so it could be unrelated? The only side effect I have now is if I miss a dose, I am extremely emotional and miserable.

Edit: I forgot the important part - I am the happiest I've ever been since developing depression 15 years ago."

VictoriaBC,fkp3dmt,t1_fkgxul7,1584400883.0,Because people are hella racist and have been staying away from Chinese restaurants and Asian grocery stores.
VictoriaBC,fkgrm1r,t3_fic9hj,1584170983.0,"That's really sad, I'm sorry. If anyone makes you pay a markup that's fucked. I heart that some of the Asian grocery stores are still well stocked with most things because, well, you know."

VictoriaBC,fiykc5s,t3_fagnd8,1582841078.0,The Indigenous youth have made huge sacrifices to be at the legislature for so long. I know some folks have lost their jobs and are selling their belongings to make ends meet. Some have brought their laptops to the legislature so that they can work/do homework from there. Don't make assumptions.
VictoriaBC,fichwo5,t3_f74536,1582347677.0,"As someone who is afraid of pretty much everything and just starting to use transit, thank you for this. Transit makes me so anxious and panicky that common sense things like this kind of go over my head until someone points it out."

VictoriaBC,fcwf7fb,t3_ej4i6r,1578024082.0,Uh. Flying back to Vic tomorrow from holidays. What kind of storm are we bracing for?
VictoriaBC,fawe725,t1_faq3pw7,1576369796.0,"I agree. I was expecting seriously life-altering injuries based on the title, then again I don't know anything about stuff like this."

Sober,f4k9bq9,t3_dks4ro,1571641025.0,"I'm three weeks into sobriety today and I also wanted to quit because of a bad night out. I was in a dark place but went out drinking with friends anyways and at the end of the night, I walked the two hours home and purposely walked through the worse neighborhood in town as, like, a self-harm tactic. I'm a 100-pound tiny lady. So I feel you. The morning after, I wrote down a big description of how I was feeling so that I could look back at it. Any time I've been tempted, I try and make myself relive that night and feel all the shame I felt. Maybe not the healthiest tactic, but it's working."

Calgary,ewmi4c7,t1_ewmguhr,1565552212.0,"Seconded! You can buy a half-pint or a pint. A bit more expensive than grocery store icecream but to me, it's worth it. Unbelievably good. They also let you try out flavours before you buy!"
