Presidents do that for a living and they need to have that mindset every single second they are in office.

Us humans? We fuck up all the time. There are many examples of ppl taking something too lightly and it ends up being a disaster.

Trump did that here. He took something that was serious, removed any visionary thinking about it, and called it as he saw it (as he always does) on the surface. He didn't consider the domino effect it would have - because he's incapable of doing that. Imagine if a time traveler told him 1,000's would die - he'd shrug and call if the flu. Imagine if that time traveler said the economy would completely tank for years - yeah, now you have his attention. He's incapable of connecting the dots in a grand scale. He excels at doing it in simple form (fuck regulations because that will help businesses; never mind the environment). 

Bush (post 9/11), Obama, Clinton, Bush, Regan - they all would have treated this seriously from moment #1...

I’m not sure about the whale comment but I don’t have any hard stats to back it up. Here’s my own experience from being in two games with that kind of approach: everyone in my clash Royale clan member buys the season pass - so that 5*50 = $250/mo. Granted, not everyone buys it every month and you can’t scale this to every clan, but even at a small conversion rate, with 100M active players, we’re talking 100’s of thousands a month, or millions, being raked in by Supercell.

A whale can’t spend that much because they’d max out the game well before hitting a million. I recall someone doing the math to max out the game and it was well below $100K. Even it was more, the whale would max out and the little fish could keep buying.

I see the same thing happening in SimCity - everyone buys it in my club. But again it doesn’t scale but it doesn’t need a huge conversion rate.

It’s literally free money for them as long as they don’t break the game dynamics. To me, giving someone a “1x  or more finish any research and  any building right now” at the end of a month long cycle, for example, would do wonders for revenues without blowing up game play.

He was on the same call as me about it, on the same email thread with me about it, if he miss understood ASAP as end of day or Monday then I have nothing...

I do have a way of working and managing my team that I understand may not fit everyone. My noting my approachability comes from a long time of being the opposite. But, yes, I get some ppl don’t like to talk to the boss at all. But in his role, he has no choice, he must talk to me to succeed and at some point, it’s difficult conversations. I’ve been asking him via chat and in person, if he needs anything, and usually get a “no, I’m good.” 

I’ve also, very clearly, set expectations around a deliverable due by the end of the month. He has enough material to make headway on it. Can he do it without feedback from me along the way or without consulting his peers and other stakeholders? No. And I haven’t seen any efforts to get this going. Is it possible he might still get it done? Yes. And yes, I’ve told him he needs my feedback and consultation and needs to work with peers and stakeholders.

Our internet use policy allows use of internet and company computing resources for a limited time so along as it does not interfere with work. There is a line in there limiting it to breaks and lunch or 30 mins at other times. While I suspect he’s spending much more time than that, I wouldn’t know for sure until I look at our URL monitoring platform. More important for me tho, is the output  - if he’s working and getting things done I’m not worried about how he spends his time. 

The things I’d need to train are essential for success in the role and were clearly denoted in the JD. He and I have spoken about this multiple times - I think he gets it, but then leave my office and doesn’t know how to get it done, or expects me to coddle him through it - the who has the monkey problem. And I’m too swamped to carry around someone else’s monkey.

While I’ve documented our conversations in my notes, I’m going to be sure to communicate these expectations in clear writing to him. He’s to finish documenting his goals on Monday (he’s late) and hopefully they match what we discussed. 

I’m going to talk my HR BP. I could be wrong about a lot of this and it might make me look bad or foolish, but I’m not prepared to carry deadweight on my team. If I’m wrong and he hits these initial deadlines and completes his goals, he’ll never know it went to HR. I will talk to him about the internet use policy, be more direct and precise about deliverables that come up in the future, and document what we’ve already discussed."
puppy101,fkduzo8,t1_fkd26s1,1584096292.0,"Thanks! This is helpful. I had planned to get him neutered as soon as he was old enough but it has slipped my mind with all the crazy shit going on in the world. I’m going to make the appointment today and hopefully get this done over the next two weeks while I’m home. 

I’m going to get a new mattress and a leak proof protector - those things suck but it’s better than having to drop a few hundred every few times this happens. Like my dog, my humans are mistake prone :-/ and will inevitably let me down by leaving the door open. 

The room is also off limits from now on. I’d let him follow me around as I get ready for work or when just home. Now he’ll have to wait outside. 

My dog is too damn smart or I’m too damn dumb for crate training - I did the 1 sec, 2 sec, thing. He knows I’m “near by” and if I get too far he goes bat shit crazy. I’m thinking “1 sec” doesn’t count for the partial seconds in between barking - and really that’s mostly what he’ll do. If there is a pause it ends when he realizes someone is coming and he decides to communicate his displeasure. He’ll get in the crate on command and will go in on his own when someone is nearby. He’s not adverse to the crate, but completely not OK with being alone. This is even after weeks where he’s had no choice but to be alone for 3-5 hours at a time. 

I’m fine with him being a dog that needs a bit more ppl time. Fine with him being Velcro. But this pissing in my has to end. I’m going to approach this optimistically with a solution at hand. 

I’m going to wait on the new mattress. Neuter him and give it a few weeks before I swap it out. 

Thanks again! I’m grateful!"
puppy101,fkd0vun,t1_fkcz99q,1584065681.0,"So I’ve had three other dogs in my life time, all crate trained, all following the methods you’d find everywhere - two with my dad, one on my own. This dog is different. Just like all humans are different. This dog is anti-dog and some other space age shit. So, technically, I gave up crate training him when he wouldn’t ever stop barking for more than a few seconds, ever. He’s fine in a crate as long as someone is close enough to pick up a scent on or is visible. 

The door to my bedroom is supposed to be closed. Kids open the door, don’t close it. He’s around the family and while they watch him, it’s not razor focused and he can sneak way long enough to pee. It gets quiet and it’s all like “where’s the dog?”. I’m sure some humans are super at 100% always watching the dog, my family and I are not.

He doesn’t sleep in his crate usually. I don’t know how that applies tho because I never let him on my bed. When he sleeps, it’s under the bed or in the closet, on rare occasion he’ll sleep in the crate which is a few feet away from me. If he jumps up to the edge of the bed, I tell him no and take his paws off. 

He’s 22 weeks old. He hasn’t pooped in the house for over 6 weeks. Last time he pissed in the house was 3 weeks ago and it was on my bed. Before that it was many weeks too. He’ll look at us and bark if it’s been too long but usually he’s out every two hours and twice after 10pm."
puppy101,fkcz1nf,t1_fkcxnrx,1584064460.0,"Never. It’s never happened. After trying for weeks and even jumping in on just a few seconds of quiet, he’s not catching it. He ignores KONG filled with liver, ignores raw bones, ignores cooked
Chicken, ignores dog food - nothing distracts him from being in the crate. I had to wait 2-3 hours for him to stop barking for more than 5 seconds on several occasions. If head ever quiet for long it was because he fell asleep (I could see him on video) and then I’d walk towards the room, he’d wake up and start barking.

I eventually had to leave him alone and he barked when I left, I watched on video while he barked non stopped for hours, then fell asleep, then continued barking again until I got back. 

He’s not alone when he pees on the bed. There are ppl home. He has zero reason to pee on the bed. He can pee on the rug, on the floor.... he goes into my room, jumps on the bed, and pees... and it’s never A LOT... like he’s been holding it for hours... but it’s enough to suck."

I get it's a character issue, but she already sliced and diced him up last time - now just throw little jabs and quips. Instead, she went full-on rockstar on him again for a good while - why? In contrast, Bernie was hot under the collar too, but he somehow managed to always bring it back to his policy positions.

I don’t make more than $250K so no worries about the added ss levy.

My tax bracket doesn’t change so top marginal rates increasing don’t affect me.

I don’t know what the 7.5% payroll tax you’re referring to is. If that’s for M4A, my employer currently pays 8.6% of my salary for my coverage, so they’d get a break too.

The 0.1% tax on the extremely wealthy to cover universal child care doesn’t hurt me.

I’m afraid to say the answer to that question is going be a resounding “no!”:

1) ppl with little to no cost healthcare will indeed end up paying more.
2) just because we get “socialized” services that doesn’t mean it’s good: public schools vs private? Postal service vs FedEX? The DMV???

Not surprisingly, it will come down to turnout.

“Implements a doughnut-hole tax on income above $250,000: The biggest change is that Sanders' plan would aim to raise revenue by taxing the wealthy. Currently, Social Security's 12.4% payroll tax applies to earned income (i.e., wages and salary) between $0.01 and $132,900, with anything above this top-end amount exempted. With the Social Security Expansion Act, a moratorium on the payroll tax would exist between $132,900 and $250,000, with earned income above this amount again subjected to the payroll tax.”"

politics,fi3egks,t3_f61vgl,1582113937.0,"Some say Bernie is the Trump of the Democrats. In order for Bernie to be successful he will need congress. If the senate doesn’t flip this year, he’s sole job will be to campaign to have it flip in 2022.  Besides that he’d have to do like Trump and use executive orders and/or emergency declarations to get things done. Am I mistaken about this?

Not being a troll but the rage doesn’t help undecided ppl who are weighing their options decide. It makes them choose between the Bloomberg they vaguely know and the anger being thrown his way. Who’s right? Who’s telling the truth? The dude with the Ads where Obama is praising him or the ppl relentlessly attacking him (regardless of how warranted it is). And politicians, all of them, lie. 

Bloomberg was elected in NYC three times and while I don’t think he ever won the Bronx, he did win Manhattan, Queens, SI, and Brooklyn  - although not all of them in all years. These places are blue to the bone. SI is red but not Alabama or Kentucky red. 

Bloomberg is not the first billionaire to run. The whole “he’s buying the election” rings hollow to me. As a sports fan it’s like saying the Yankees will always win the World Series because they have the highest payroll. They lost to one of he lowest payrolls in the MLB - the Florida Marlins. Do they have an advantage, yes, as does Bloomberg. Perot spent records amounts in ‘92 and lost. Rockefeller didn’t win either. Washington, adjusted for inflation, is one the richest presidents ever. 

As for Bloomy being the same as Trump. I don’t buy that either. I will disagree with many of Bloomberg’s policies and will hate the lack of some. I’m sure he’s not going to forgive student debt, probably not going to provide M4A, will likely raise my taxes, etc. All Trump-like positions. But I can live with that as long as he respects the rule of law, doesn’t cage children, protects women’s rights, practices fair and compassionate immigration, restores our position on the world stage, protects veterans, etc. 

Is it ideal? No. I’d much rather prefer Bernie because he’s offering it all. I don’t know if he can win tho and that’s scares me. Idk if Mike can either. 

Anyway, long post for something that I likely have no say in as NY primaries aren’t until April!

I’m voting blue no matter who."
