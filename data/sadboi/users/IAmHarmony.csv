juul,fohk95j,t1_fohg0u4,1587767355.0,"Yeah but the clip still sounds like that's what he's trying to say. And when 30% of the population is just as dumb as you it's a little alarming to think of how many idiots who blindly follow Trump will inject disinfectant to own the libs. Also the people who think that everything he says is a 4d secret message might also think differently. And also HE'S THE PRESIDENT. If he was still a regular citizen he wouldn't get blasted so hard but he is in such a position that anything he says warrants criticism and analysis. 

No, Fox news and Breitbart aren't reliable news sources. But you can't admit that because that's where you get YOUR news from. I understand, and that okay.

I'm just wondering why Trump supporters are so blind or stupid to realize that the people who are most vulnerable to this disease or are more likely to try the things that Trump talks about ARE TRUMP SUPPORTERS lol. Like do you actually think anyone to the left of his political bases space on the political spectrum is going to actually inject themselves with disinfectant? Of course not.

It's not hard to imagine someone who is 50+ and protesting the lockdown getting Coronavirus and panicking and thinking what Trump said about injecting disinfectants and following through with them. Although that isn't what he meant.

It's getting to the point where you people are on such another planet I want to tell you to smoke a joint to bring you back to reality. 50,000+ AMERICANS ARE DEAD and you all don't give a shit because it's happening under this administration. If Obama was president it would be a storm of criticism and ridicule from Trump Supporters and Republicans in general. 

You seem like the type of person to be a constitution warrior but alas, the USPS is enshrined in the constitution and is being killed by this administration and you're silent. And again the people that the USPS benefits the most are the rural communities, where Trump's base is! I just don't get it. I don't get why some Trump Supporters are either too blind, too selfish, or too stupid to care about other Trump Supporters. 

At the end of the day you're just upset that people are in quarantine and they have nothing else to do but wake up and realize that every other day this president says some dumb shit that doesn't make any sense. Just like he has been since he announced his candidacy."

But first, did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis the Wise?

I thought not. It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life... He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Ironic, he could save others from death, but not himself."
