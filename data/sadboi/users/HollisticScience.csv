AmItheAsshole,fqdmh6n,t1_fqcofin,1589292675.0,What you're doing isn't actually confronting the situation and telling her how you feel though. You're just avoiding it verging on passive aggression.

Are you seriously going to tell me you've never needed to vent in your life? Get off your high horse talking about how we need to be grateful and acting like people can just find a new job. Everyone has a different situation and you have no clue what's going on in our lives.

Chipotle,fpo5swe,t1_fpnlrxv,1588778877.0,Man have some fucking empathy. Most of our stores are incredibly understaffed because everyone quit to quarentine or moved back home. The online ordering system is fucked for promising in 15 minutes intervals and having an insanely high cap. People get mad at us for not social distancing but we literally can't work if we have to stay 6 feet apart. The online ordering system is constantly glitching out and guests are getting mad at us about it even though we have no control and IT gives us attitude for not getting all the information they need to fix it even though the store is at max capacity. We're fried man. But go on and call us entitled

coolguides,fpg8jq0,t1_fpe50lq,1588597148.0,Yeah. The 24 hour for a missing person one is weird. Because people have certain rights there's a lot police can't do until after the 48 hour mark. My roomate went missing and we didn't find her until 48 hours later on the dot of reporting her because they didn't start looking for her in other counties until 48 hours later. We reported her missing in two counties but she was in the county jail of a nearby county. They wouldn't go through any of her stuff until 48 hours later either. So you can report it and it will work but there's a lot that won't happen until 48 hours later

Especially because we're so understaffed because we're in a college town and 75% of the employees went back home. So now we've got this internet volume of online orders coming in that we can hardly handle and chipotles online ordering system is so fucked up. Stuff is barely getting out on time.
