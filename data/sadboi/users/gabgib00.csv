depression,eubeqjf,t3_anh7tv,1563646350.0,"I could sit here and tell you about the many things I’ve been diagnosed with in regards to my mental health, but I’ll save that boring conversation for another time. I have been dealing with major depression for almost 9 years now, I’ve gone to many doctors, therapists, rehab facilities, but nothing works for me. I’ve been on several medications over the years which I don’t feel work for me at all. I’m a 19 year old girl who barley graduated high school in 2018 and I can barley talk to people or keep a job. I hate waking up every morning to go to work. It actually physically makes me ill thinking about leaving my bed. I don’t have friends, I’m always by myself, I live with my mom who I love dearly but her husband has sexually harassed me and I can’t stand being in the same room as him, even though I’m too scared to move away, because I know I’m incapable of being on my own. And I’m mad at my mom for staying with him. She knows what he did too me. I’m constantly tired, always sleeping when I can. I have anger that’s out of this world. It’s really bad and I think I got that from my dad. I feel like a loser as my younger sister is off too college this fall and I’m still in the small town with my mom working at a dumb ass local grocery store for 6 hours everyday. I get really bad days where I self harm myself pretty bad and all I want to do is die, and it’s so painful I can’t breathe or see and my head feels like it’s about to explode. Mostly though, I’m just numb. Pretty much existing for no reason. Repeating the same thing over and over again every day. I lose all feelings about everything. I could care less if someone is hurting or if I upset them, and if something bad happens to me I shrug it off like it’s a normal fucking thing and shit happens. I’m pretty much only staying alive for my family. I wish they didn’t love me so I could easily leave this world behind. I’m mad that they are holding me back from what I want, and what I want is death. All of this is bullshit. The trauma and the loss and everything I’ve been through follows me through every day of life that I live. I’m just tired. I want to sleep and never wake up."
