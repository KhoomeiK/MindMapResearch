AmItheAsshole,eosbkyb,t1_eos71vj,1558820642.0,"Yeah, I think that is the hardest thing to accept. That no matter how much everyone tells him ultimately he has to choose better. I just hate that it just when I thought he was finally getting close to our daughter. She is 12 years old now, I can see her disdain for the girlfriend."
AmItheAsshole,eos4sj3,t1_eorrf3v,1558817639.0,He recently has made a bigger effort to bond with our daughter. I have never meddled with his.personal life but he reached.out to me first. I tried to stay out it for a while. It's.just difficult to see someone you care about fucking their life up after how hard they worked to get on track.
AskReddit,eo8w8kw,t1_eo86mku,1558376235.0,Same thing happened to me. Went to one ER got sent home with pills couldn't take the pain even with several pills. Went to a second ER and the doctor immediately freaked out. Several spinal tap later I had meningitis! Worse 15 days of my life!
