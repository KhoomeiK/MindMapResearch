adultsurvivors,fb9elxy,t3_ec3cpl,1576636551.0,"I could of wrote this whole post verbatim. How old are you? If you can get help, get help! Tell a school counselor or a doctor. These people are not your family, they are not protecting you or looking out for your best interests. My therapist always tells me that a family system that lets this happen and then does nothing about it has no integrity. The best thing to do is to get away, there are non profits that can shelter you and help you press charges. Please message me if you want to talk more."

But if you have support/friends/partner that could help you look for a new therapist it may work. I just found a counseling practice that solely is for adult survivors of sexual assault. I never thought I would find people that would understand. They are there, don’t let your light go out."
ptsd,f8r8nfw,t3_e1mrwo,1574734579.0,"Your testimony is public. Every time he is pulled over, background checked, moves, etc people will see he’s a sex offender. See him for what he truly is. There is some satisfaction in that. If there is ever a doubt that he’s doing something inappropriate after he is released, he’s going to be guilty until proven innocent. None of this may matter to you, but you are protecting so many more than you could ever know. You are strong and brave. No one can take that from you."
adultsurvivors,f8r5oeu,t3_e1khfx,1574732555.0,"The same thing happened to me. Ten years later- I just went to court to make him criminally accountable for what he did, and he went on stand and LIED. They don’t want to be held accountable for their actions. He was still charged guilty. Moral of the story- you need to do what’s best for you. It’s incredibly hard to be in a family that doesn’t support you and in the end not in your best interests. PM me if you ever need to talk."
