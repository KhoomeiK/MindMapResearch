coys,fms3rxl,t1_fmrsu7s,1586345631.0,"Let me put this in a different way. So right now Spurs as an organization has two main concerns:

1. The future of their organization...how does what's happening now effect what they can accomplish next year to 5 years from now.

2. The future of their employees...beleive me, Tottenham doesnt want to lay off workers. Morally it sucks but financially it is also a pain in the ass for companies.


The furlough process is meant to give employees an opportunity to keep their jobs going forward. Reduce pay now so that, three months from now, if there is little change in working conditions caused by Covid19, Spurs won't have to make the decision to lay off their entire staff.

I think it's important to note that mostly EVERYONE is struggling right now in their own way. Spurs and other organizations are in damage control mode right now. Because if this continues for another 3 months...or longer...there will be huge financial repercussions for the club. They are trying to control what they can. It costs a TON of money to train and find new hires. The last thing the club wants is too have to lay off people a month from now only to rehire and need to train new hires a few months after. 

The moral obligations of the club are to their workers first and foremost. The people who keep the operation running and make Spurs what it is. I think the Furlough has good intentions. And I think if things get worse (hopefully not but things aren't looking good) people will look at this decision and understand why it made a whole lot of sense.

**Edit:** it's also worth mentioning that everyone employed at the club is, presumably, a lawful taxpayer. They have just as much right to the Unemployment compensation as anyone else."
coys,fmqnvso,t1_fmqd2dj,1586303346.0,"I see. I mean from my perspective, I work for a very large corporation, just as big if not bigger than Tottenham, and I'm on 40% furlough. 


I don't think its fair to expect the club to pay workers who, let's be honest, aren't doing a full load of work right now solely because Tottenham has oodles of money to give away. In fact, those workers should feel LUCKY that they still have jobs and they are still getting 80%. Honestly that's pretty extraordinary considering the circumstances.


The club needs to make business decision with their own agenda in mind. At the end of the day, its a business and the Taxpayer isn't really their concern. They aren't breaking any rules or laws to make this happen....the furlough system is in place for a reason and Tottenham/other companies are using it...I don't think I see an issue with that and you can't hold large companies accountable for utilizing the system. They have a bottom line too.


You don't leave all the lights on when you leave the house because you can afford it...you save money where you can. I bet you if you asked Bill Gates if he shuts off the lights when he leaves his house, he would say yes. Doesn't matter how rich you are, you have to look out for your budget.

And you could be completely right. I work in a field where I need to read people who I dont know. Complete strangers. And sometimes I'm wrong....


But most of the time I'm right...otherwise I'd be out of the job. I dont need to have the documentary skew me or influence me. I'm smart enough to see through that. 


But what I can see for certain are her reactions to speaking about her late husband. How she ""recalls"" information. The out of place hysterical laughter when speaking about serious subject matter. The obsessive behavior. The way she treated the family of her late husband and finances surrounding his death. The general lack of interest in the people who work for her. She is crooked. She checks off all the boxes. Something is off.

And the most damning is when she is addressed with certain murder rumours. I can tell you how she didnt kill her husband! She definitely didn't feed him to the tigers! You know how I know? Not because it's not plausible. It's because of how quickly she latched onto the absurdity of the suggestion. People who have something to hide do this all the time. 


(See OJ Simpson's book ""If I Did It"") 


When you feed a suspicious person scenarios that are complete slander, they will feed on it and swear up and down how they ""could never have done it like that!""


Becsuse in their mind, they know they didnt commit the crime...at least not in that way. You gave them an outlet to tell the truth amidst a bunch of lies. 


Have you ever been accused of something you didn't do? Even if it was something small. How did it make you feel? I bet you said ""angry"" or ""frustrated""

That's because that's how most people feel. Its **infuriating** to be accused of something you didnt do. It's like the worst feeling in the world. And yet, Carole shows little signs of being angered by the situation. She finds it hysterical. It's always ""absurd""

To me, there is something wrong with that. And you're right I need more information but I've got a pretty good base to make an educated guess that she is guilty of SOMETHING awful. Shes hiding something."
IAmA,flzmahv,t1_flzep2y,1585627212.0,"But the ""slant"" isnt completely unfounded and biased. There are MANY people who know Carole and think she is dangerous. She is clearly very manipulative, as are all the exotic pet owners, and can alter someone's perception of her rather easily.

I'll be completely honest, I would take the word of someone like OP with a grain of salt in regards to Carole Baskins. Because even though I beleive that she is doing this AMA on her own accord, I believe that she has clouded judgment of who Carole is as a person.


The more contact one has with a manipulate person, the harder it is for that person to have an accurate perception of the manipulator."

personalfinance,fj9uue0,t3_fc3vft,1583160141.0,"I don't think it's as black and white as people are making it out to be. It really depends on your specific situation. I would say the only savings you shouldn't think about touching unless put under extraordinary circumstances is a retirement account like a 401K. So dont touch that because your car loan doesnt qualify as a extraordinary circumstance.


I've always learned that you should pay off your debt before you start to save. But more specifically, debt with high interest rates. For example, I've had to take out a personal loan before in order to consolidate high interest credit card debt...but the interest rate on the personal loan was still high...just lower than the credit cards interest. 


In order to avoid paying absurd interest on the loan, I had to hold off all savings until the loan was payed off. The loan interest was like 20% annually 

In your specific situation, when speaking about a car loan, the 4% really isn't that high. Yeah it sucks to be paying a car loan, but I wouldnt dump all my savings into it for 4%. What I would do instead is pay a bit more than what your paying now, even if it's like $50 more.

Eventually, you'll start making more than $50k a year and you can contribute more to the car loan. But hang on to your savings in this particular case."

For me as a 26 year old I'm paying $800/ month in student loans that wont go away anytime soon, $400/ month on a personal loan that I used to consolidate credit card debt, I'm paying absurd levels of rent and living expenses, car payments, health insurance, and the list goes on.


With $100,000 I could make a lot of these problems go away and have money left over to open up an IRA or some sort of savings in which I would never be able to do now.


The benefit for people to pay off loans and not accumulate interest over time is astronomical. While you would most likely net more money by waiting the 10 years, the opportunities and freedom you earn by taking the money tomorrow is much more valuable."

That being said, I think we can admit that he has some pretty obvious weaknesses. His distribution is well below average and he has a tendency to make mistakes. That doesn't mean I'm saying he's bad...but to sit here and say that he is a perfect keeper would be lying. 

In other words, I think it's less that he is underrated and more that other keepers are overrated."
