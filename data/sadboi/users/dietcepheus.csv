Fish and chip shops are all over the country. Most towns will have several regardless of socioeconomic status. Obviously the style of the shop will be catered to the typical clientele.

Never. It's a fillet of fish, usually cod but haddock and plaice are common. Even the small pieces are generally pretty huge. 

> all covered in some type of ""vinegar"" which may or may not be legally allowed to be called as such.  

Vinegar is always an option but not everyone has it. You are right that often the vinegar chippies use is actually something called non-brewed condiment. It depends though, I've seen places with actual vinegar from a well-known brand.

At the time, it didn't feel like a big deal that the show pretty much cut these out. However, given Dany's fate in the show, it seems D&D really missed a trick by not including these. Her descent (aka nose dive) into madness may have made a modicum more sense if she was constantly haunted by the visions she'd seen in the House of the Undying and being whispered to by Quaithe.
