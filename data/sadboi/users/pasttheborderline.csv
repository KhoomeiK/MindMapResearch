BPD,flktcco,t1_flkdi4s,1585247304.0,"This is spot-on. I’m so used to this petrifying fear that everyone else is feeling and when they start expressing their concern, I get really annoyed. And it’s mostly a matter of why should they get to panic at this and when all they’ve done is shut me down whenever I would panic at something that gave me the same level of stress??"
BPD,flesrqn,t3_fo9egb,1585090801.0,Oh that’s awesome! I actually ended up rearranging my room too and that ended up doing pretty well. It feels good to have control over something during this time haha.
BPD,fla2m4y,t1_fla1log,1584975253.0,"With this sub, responses on individual posts mostly depend on timing and who sees it. Most of the time posts go unnoticed simply because people just don’t see them. Reaching out with unsolicited negativity on somebody else’s celebration of triumph is definitely not the way to go, though. It’s honestly a really shitty thing to do. That’s why people are upset with you. I’m trying to give you the benefit of the doubt because a lot of the things I post to this sub when I am upset or need advice go ignored, too, and it sucks. It has nothing to do with who you are or what you’re saying though, it just has to do with who happens to come across it when you post it. I hope you have better luck with outreach in the future, though. Sounds like you’re really going through it."
BPD,fl9u197,t1_fl92bm2,1584969255.0,Thank you!! That means a lot <3
BPD,fl9tzro,t1_fl96lgu,1584969222.0,"Thank you!! Honestly I can’t wait for the stuff to come in, it’s gonna be so cool haha"
BPD,fl9txdr,t1_fl9n6y7,1584969169.0,"Thanks :) It’s tough, especially with everything piling on, but I’m just trying to work one step at a time."
BPD,fl9ttop,t1_fl95x4d,1584969086.0,"Hey pal.. I get the struggle. It sucks. But if you’re wanting to vent these feelings, maybe you should make your own post. Yeah, you don’t need to hide what you feel, but maybe try not making somebody else’s success story about you? It’s kinda a dick move. And, for the record, I meant c*tting. I also clarified that my shopping wasn’t harmful as I did not stretch myself beyond my limits and I still have a method of income. I’m sorry you feel bad, but you might be able to get more support if you stayed in your own lane. :)"
BPD,fl91yxc,t3_fndqh7,1584938467.0,"You can’t be diagnosed until you’re 18, and many therapists will want to monitor you for quite a while if you’re a teen just to determine if your symptoms are developmental or a result of BPD. I’ve been displaying symptoms since I was very young, though, so it’s certainly possible. I’d suggest doing research and talking with a psych to get to the bottom of it and help make things better :)"
BPD,fl2gbff,t3_fm0vty,1584750364.0,"That’s not how it works, unfortunately. Having a job isn’t completely fruitless, though. Having something to do on a near-daily basis gives you a reason to get up and be productive. And the paycheck is a nice touch, too. But it does very little to alleviate symptoms. It’s a good distraction, but it does’t cure BPD."
BPD,fkz5buj,t3_fl64ri,1584663120.0,"Oooof, this happened to me about a week ago. I dreamed I fell in love with a cute girl at ComicCon and when I woke up, I was devastated that I could never find love in the real world and I felt like I was unlovable."
DECA,fkliu8y,t1_fklilwr,1584307245.0,"Oh yeah, BSM sounds pretty fun. Maybe you should try a professional selling event? I never did one myself but supposedly they’re a nice challenge."
DECA,fklihjn,t1_fklf4br,1584307004.0,Nope. I wanted to switch things up and diversify my trophy case!
DECA,fkijqi5,t1_fkifsjg,1584221642.0,HLM. Previously I did PMK and SEM.

BPD,fjlqy2t,t3_fdxnv9,1583452426.0,Road rage is one of those things that will be the tipping point into a rage episode for me. It makes me furious when people are driving like idiots and it does feel weirdly personal.
BPD,fh9pjcp,t3_f1t74g,1581386695.0,Yup. Hence me saying “bizin” instead of bison.
BPD,fg0hj4m,t3_ew9mco,1580407924.0,This hits too close to home.
BPD,felctm4,t3_eprtb3,1579219165.0,"I’d suggest trying to teach them better coping skills and finding a healthy way to process the loss of their FP. If they keep harming the body, it might be best to try to keep them from fronting until they’re able to see the psychologist, who’d be able to help them.
I definitely understand why they’re hesitant to talk to the psych because I often feel that way towards MY psych. It’s something you’ve gotta help them shake off or else they won’t listen. Make sure to tell them that you’re on their side and the psych is too; that might let them better receive the psych’s help."
BPD,fedwike,t3_eonxw2,1579021374.0,"Definitely make sure you’re doing what’s best for your wellbeing. There’s always time to go back to college if you feel like it, but having a job is gonna help a lot more for the position you’re in now. I hope everything turns out okay. Good luck!"
dankmemes,fdqfiqx,t3_emrabg,1578665361.0,We live in a society
BPD,fd6694f,t3_ek5h1n,1578186105.0,"I’ve had issues with binging, but honestly have no clue where to start for me. I think that if you feel the need to finish something, you could try putting stuff into different smaller containers so finishing something doesn’t make you eat as much. I’ve also heard that drinking tea is good for when you’re not hungry but still want to eat. I think you’re making the right call by taking measures to ensure that, if you are overeating, it’s something not too terribly unhealthy. Good luck!"
BPD,fd5gxfn,t1_fd5g2rt,1578177516.0,Thank you :) I’m glad I got insight from someone without BPD; it helps to see the other side.
BPDmemes,fcutvlb,t3_eizftz,1577988387.0,Okay thank god I’m not alone with the age regression. I thought I was victim to some Freudian stuff
BPD,fbi8efz,t3_edjj6k,1576893718.0,"I feel this. Just be safe and careful, don’t do anything you’re not comfortable with just for his sake, and try not to take it too hard if he doesn’t live up to expectations. I hope it goes well :)"

BPD,f9o1eie,t1_f9nuwzx,1575494543.0,"I usually try to apply pressure to the area. It happens a lot in my toes, so I curl them up and press them against the bottom of my shoes. I don’t really know if there’s an easy way to handle it on larger appendages, though. Maybe try using a chair or something to put your foot on and stretch your legs? I hope this is at least a little helpful, haha."
BPD,f9npn86,t3_e64igv,1575488581.0,Oh my god I get this too!! I don’t know if it’s a Borderline thing or just a coincidence but I know EXACTLY what you’re talking about!
BPD,f6pdot7,t3_dshp6y,1573054007.0,"You’re certainly not alone. It’s really easy to lose control and I commend you for being able to regain it before too much damage was done. It’s just something that takes time, practice, and thought. It’s key to recognize destructive behavior so you can work to fix it. Don’t lose hope."
BPD,ex49h92,t3_crekl2,1566001101.0,I’m proud of you for looking out for yourself and being upfront about your boundaries. It’s certainly not easy to do that when it’s someone you care about and want to be happy. But that guy’s behavior was absolutely disgusting. You did the right thing to protect yourself.
BPD,ewx1rq2,t3_cqkios,1565841466.0,"I feel this. Even after a minor disagreement, if I get three minutes of silence I’ll spiral into thinking that our friendship is over and often I’ll split on them. It’s always a big deal to me, and then when I ask if we’re cool, they brush it off like it was nothing. It feels like they think I’m crazy for thinking it had such a huge impact on our friendship. Part of me knows they’re reassuring me that everything is fine even though we argued, but I can never shake the feeling that they don’t want to interact with me specifically because of how I react to conflict."
BPD,eww8oay,t1_eww67n5,1565823082.0,This hits SO close to home. Laughing with my friends makes me feel like the world finally makes sense and that I have a solid identity.
BPD,ewtp54g,t1_ewtor3u,1565750619.0,"Asking questions is good, it’s just stacking them one on top of the other (ie. question, answer, then immediately another question without allowing them to continue) that gets a little more than tedious. Especially yes or no questions. It’s not the same for everyone, though, and it’s definitely meaningful that you’re expressing interest, so take my anecdote with a grain of salt."
BPD,ewoliru,t3_cpcm9k,1565621009.0,"Ugh, trying to explain to friends that you’re trying not to hurt them just results in them just pestering you more and trying to help you solve problems they don’t understand. Honestly, it’s not worth the trouble, though, admittedly, I’m not the greatest at handling this (I tend to drop off the grid without warning). Maybe just tell them you need alone time and leave it at that? You can always handle them better when you have a clear head."
BPD,ewnmppf,t1_ewnmddm,1565582925.0,"Well, like I said, you could try coming up with ways to manage your reaction to how your parents feel so you have them ready the next time you confront them. I wish I could tell you exactly what those ways are, but everybody handles it differently."
BPD,ewnl7nd,t3_cp6oxe,1565581561.0,"I don’t know if there’s a term for it, but I know exactly what you’re talking about (I just call them “rage episodes”). In my experience, it’s nearly impossible to control it unless you quash it right when it starts to build up. I’d suggest identifying triggers and ways to either avoid them or handle them before going into a rage episode."
BPD,ewmuq3n,t3_cp30yi,1565561006.0,"I get this way sometimes. I’ll catch myself in a mirror and not be able to process “oh that’s me.” Like, I recognize that it’s the reflection of my body but I don’t see ME."
