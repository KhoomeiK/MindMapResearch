ptsd,fqc00bf,t1_fqbqd89,1589247315.0,"It might be important also to point out that my EMDR therapist said it has been successful for 90% of her clients. She noted that most of the 10% it hasn't worked for continued to see her, but she believed they fit criteria for personality disorders (such as borderline personality disorder, narcissistic personality, antisocial, histrionic, etc). She found veterans and first responders were more likely to require less sessions (6-10), while victims of abuse and rape took a bit longer (10-20). Childhood abuse and complex PTSD generally took the longest.

She pointed out that everyone experiences trauma in life in varying degrees. The more episodes of trauma, the longer it takes to overcome. The earlier in life that the trauma happened, the more it shapes the way we view ourselves and the world. It also doesn't matter how often the EMDR sessions happen. I did twice a week because I wanted to be ""normal"" again asap. But it's still possible to get healing if you're doing once a week, twice a month, once a month."
ptsd,fqbytge,t1_fqbqd89,1589246623.0,"No, I weaned off medication before I tried EMDR, just to make sure it worked. I even stopped taking sleeping medication for a while. Sometimes I take sleeping pills, but I had slight insomnia before PTSD.

I'm from the US. Insurance paid for the treatment.

My PTSD was somewhat complex post traumatic stress, or C-PTSD. I was in an abusive relationship with a supervisor at my workplace, where I experienced rape and had a gun held once to my head and once in my mouth. It resulted in a lawsuit where I had to relive and share the trauma in great detail. The PTSD lasted about 2 years, until I received EMDR therapy. I still do talk therapy sometimes, but it's more just to check my mental health, and I haven't had any setbacks or reverted back to the PTSD. Not one single nightmare, not one single flashback. I can look back on it easily and tell myself ""that's just a bad thing I learned from"" without anxiety attached to it."
ptsd,fqbjirc,t1_fqbijcp,1589238155.0,"All of my symptoms. I had recurring nightmares that made it difficult to sleep (even sometimes despite medication, although Prazosin did help a lot). Panic attacks and flashbacks almost daily. Memory troubles, exhaustion, random outbursts of anger. I was always on high alert, especially in crowded areas, the smallest things would set me off. I also isolated and found little pleasure in the things I used to love. I grew up with a belief that most people in the world were inherently good, and the trauma crushed that belief, which I had a difficult time processing. All of these negative symptoms naturally faded away  with EMDR.

It's very difficult to go through EMDR, because it opens up the wounds and forces you to face the trauma and reprocess it. For a few days after each session, I felt horrible, which is normal. But slowly (and relatively quickly!) I was able to look at the trauma objectively and prevent it from controlling my thoughts and emotions. My therapist used vibrating pads for bilateral stimulation, but some use lights or audio. I preferred the vibrating pads, because I was able to close my eyes and visualize better.

Advice,fq2zapi,t1_fq2qgmw,1589061574.0,"I noticed in another reply you are scared that you won't be believed. That's a super valid fear to have. I've gone through this myself, because my romantic partner sexually assaulted me.

When you tell your parents or anyone else that you have been assaulted, they will have questions. Sometimes these questions can feel very accusatory or distrusting. Parents don't want to believe that something bad happened to their child; sometimes the shock will seem like they don't believe you. Understand that it will take them time to fully process what happened. You might not get the reaction you want or need right away. Make sure you stress that you want professional help, and (if you're comfortable with it) maybe invite them to go on the healing journey with you. A therapist can be a great buffer between you and your parents, and they will be well-equipped to help your parents understand what kind of support you need. At the end of the day, it's important for them to know what happened so they can support you. They love you very very much, no matter what."
Advice,fq2q773,t3_gglmk9,1589058564.0,"I'm so sorry that you're going through this. I can't imagine how difficult it is as a teenager trying to heal from sexual trauma alone.

It's not your fault. You didn't do anything that caused this trauma. While it's normal to feel shame, you have no reason to feel ashamed. This is a bad thing that happened TO you; not just a bad thing that you were part of. It's important to take the blame off of yourself and embrace the feeling of anger that comes with being wronged. That will remind you that you deserve help.

The absolute best thing you can do is confide in someone you trust and ask for help. It would be better if this was an adult who could help you find therapeutic resources. I highly suggest EMDR therapy, as it helped me the most in my years of sexual-assault-related trauma therapy. It's normal to feel mistrust towards women after what you went through. It's normal to have a whole bunch of feelings; it's also normal to sometimes feel numb. Therapy will make sure that those feelings (or lack thereof) don't control you. Ideally, it will bring you a sense of peace, and the trauma will have no power to control your life at all."
mentalhealth,fpq5yzq,t3_geu7xa,1588815839.0,"You went through trauma. If trauma goes unaddressed, it can cause a lot of anxiety and depression.

I strongly recommend EMDR therapy. It's typically very short (only 8-16 sessions) and it helps the brain reprocess traumatic memories. You may not be able to start right away due to covid-19, but you can find EMDR specialists in your area on www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapists."
mentalhealth,fp31642,t1_fp2zpof,1588271325.0,"It's not stupid to feel anxious, ever. It's just the child inside of you that feels out of control. Listen to the inner child and nurture them.

Mental health is tricky, because we can't see it with our eyes. If we hurt our wrist a little and it's just bruised, we know that we can just ice it and it'll be fine in a few days. But if our hand gets chopped off, we get to the hospital asap, who cares about the bill. It's important to know that having suicidal ideation (even if you don't think you will act on it) is just as life threatening as a chopped off limb. What's the point in having money if you aren't alive and safe enough to use it? A lot of therapists can work with you on price (often if you say ""I can only afford $x per month"", they will either take you up on it or refer you to another therapist who will). Or compromise by going once a month instead of weekly.

I really can't recommend EMDR enough. People see results in as little as 6 sessions. I stopped EMDR after just 12 sessions and haven't needed therapy at all since. There are tons of affordable EMDR therapists you can find on psychologytoday.com."
mentalhealth,fp2ynpj,t3_gaosol,1588270097.0,"This is such a fascinating observation. It's great that you're introspective enough to notice this in yourself.

You aren't alone either. When I had an eating disorder, I felt the same way. The fear of losing my fear of food. Being uncomfortably thin was my ""aesthetic"". I was infatuated and intoxicated by even the most disgusting parts of the disorder: the intentionally-inflicted shame, feeling lethargic all the time, flirting with death. It's crazy to look back now as a recovered person. I was so afraid of losing control, that I refused to consider a life in which I didn't have that control. It's easy to confuse being comfortable with being happy. They aren't the same.

I'd challenge you to tackle one fear per day. Consciously do one single thing that scares you, even if it's small. When you see that you survive the thing that scares you, it'll slowly build your confidence."
mentalhealth,fp2wu81,t1_fp2uplg,1588269215.0,"If you experienced trauma as a child, it may be worth looking into C-PTSD, or complex post traumatic stress disorder. C-PTSD can be symptomatic for decades.

Some people are genetically predisposed to anxiety. Anxiety is no fault of your own. There doesn't always need to be someone to blame.
My grandmother has a hormone-related anxiety disorder, caused by her endocrine system's inability to regulate adrenaline. There are so many physiological factors that can play into anxiety and depression. That's why it's so important to get professionals involved.

Shame is a very normal feeling to have; but how we respond to the feeling of shame can make or break us. The child inside of you deserves to be nurtured. It may help to use this mindfulness technique: when you have feelings of shame, guilt, or anxiety, picture yourself as an 8 year old child. Imagine that child having those feelings, and how that child might express those feelings. If that 8 year old child was literally alive inside of you, how would you help that child cope? Would you starve that child? Would you insult and shame the child? Put on a cute movie. Give yourself a bowl of ice cream. Remind yourself that you're strong and it's okay to have feelings."
mentalhealth,fp1rmiz,t3_gaqce8,1588245673.0,"I'm only speculating here, but this sounds like PTSD. I experienced very similar hyper focused outbursts that felt outside of my control, and my doctor told me it was a symptom of PTSD. I suffered with it for years. I witnessed those symptoms in an ex-partner of mine too, who was a veteran with PTSD.

EMDR therapy was immensely helpful in my experience. It took less than 12 sessions, and I have not had any lingering PTSD symptoms since then. If you experience nightmares or night terrors, I'd recommend asking a doctor about prazosin, it somehow magically got rid of my nightmares.

The only thing that will help is allowing yourself to dive deep into past traumas and evaluate it in an objective way. When we immediately experience a trauma, our subconscious brain or child brain reacts in a way that is not logical and it often instills negative, unfair, biased beliefs about yourself and the world. For example, my trauma made me believe I was weak. I developed paranoia and anxiety because I didn't believe I had the strength to take on dangers. Once I was able to dive into the trauma and look at the situation objectively, I could say, ""Actually, I wasn't weak; I'm strong because I survived.""
EMDR therapy focuses on things like this, reframing your subconscious thoughts. Highly, highly recommend."
Advice,fos2nlj,t3_g95les,1588022864.0,"I'm sorry that you're having to manage your mother's emotional outbursts, on top of your own emotions. I had a similar relationship with my mother growing up, and I've since cut her out of my life after years of trying to get her to understand how her behavior impacts me.

It's important to know that these are HER emotions and it is not your responsibility to take them on for her. You mentioned she wants you to be like her friends' ""ivy league kids"". It sounds like she is feeling insecure as a mother. She is comparing her situation to her friend's situation and feeling inferior.

It sounds like her way of coping with her own stress is to have emotional outbursts directed at you. She views her child as ""within her control"", so she focuses on you when other stressors feel out of control.

When she starts having an outburst, it's important to remain calm. When people approach you yelling or upset, they want and expect you to react equally upset, and that's what causes them to emotionally purge even more.
Remain calm, and ask her questions. ""Are you feeling okay?"" is my favorite, because it turns the conversation around on them. ""You seem upset, did something else happen that triggered this?"" Or if she's working, ""Is everything okay at work?"" Just ask a lot of questions that might open up the real reason she is upset, and it takes the focus away from you.

Boundaries are very important too. Both of you need to practice setting and maintaining healthy boundaries. It could be as simple as saying, ""It's okay if you want to talk to me when I'm in my room, but I don't react well when you barge in. Can you knock on the wall first or ask me to come out instead?"" Also, ask her what some of her boundaries are, and hear her out.
It might be a good idea to suggest your mother look into therapy. There are a lot of therapists who do phone or video sessions during the pandemic. Even being open to participate too could make the household more peaceful for the both of you.

Is it still possible where you live to go on walks or go to a park? When you're overwhelmed, it's important to find a place to go and be alone. Maybe that could just be walking in circles around the building. Or going outside to call a friend or your boyfriend.

If your mother is completely unwilling to work on making the household a peaceful place, she risks losing her relationship with you. A lot of parents think their kids will never abandon them just because they're parents...but this isn't true. You're almost 18, and you'll soon have the choice of having her in your life or not.

At the end of the day, focus on what's best for you, and don't take your mother's misdirected stress out on yourself. You're doing great!"
