I had what I though was a chest cold about a month ago. I started to feel better, then had a serious relapse the beginning of this week, with symptoms being much more severe. 
  We had to move 2 weeks ago, and the movers did use PPE. I isolated in a separate room, but have obviously had contact with boxes and other items. I‚Äôve been staying at home, but my husband has been out to get groceries. Note he hasn‚Äôt been showing any symptoms.
  I don‚Äôt have a thermometer, but I didn‚Äôt feel like I had a fever, but I had severe chest congestion & difficulty breathing, as well as excessive lethargy. I was gasping for breath & felt pressure on my lungs. 
  The last 24 hours I have been feeling significantly better. I have the option to cue for drive through testing tomorrow.
