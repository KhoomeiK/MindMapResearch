bipolar,fddunyj,t3_ekr6eu,1578324409.0,Medication can help make episodes less frequent and less sever but they still might come. I’m on abilify but I still get episodes. Today I woke up feeling like life is not worth living but here I am at work tending to my responsibilities anyway. Hope you feel better. Maybe talk to your psychiatrist and let them know that you’re still having symptoms.
bipolar,fcxjj3m,t3_ejcx3c,1578064488.0,It’s happened to me on a few mixed episodes where I’ll be so damn happy and excited about everything that I can’t contain myself but also sobbing at the same time because I just want to die

bipolar,fc3ii81,t1_fc3hqeg,1577390543.0,It’s very uncomfortable
bipolar,fc3c76u,t1_fc3b3kf,1577386569.0,"That’s cool that you’re willing to go out by yourself, use that opportunity to make friends too! 

I have the same issue with NYE. My fiancé is working till 11pm that day and I really wanna go out and do something fun instead of going to my parents house to fall asleep on their couch. I wanna go out and do something fun and exciting but I also feel obligated to wait at home for him to have the midnight kiss. And he doesn’t want to go out afterwards he just wants to hang out at his parents house which is not what I am interested in. So I’m at a loss of what to do too."

bipolar,fbxt2ud,t3_eeyq0c,1577199766.0,My parents are the same. They are skeptical of doctors and think I am making it all up. My mom blames my depression on a “unhealthy diet” and try’s to force feed me supplements to “cure me”. It can be really frustrating but at the end of the day what they think is not what matters. What matters is that you are doing what you need to do to Lead the best life possible.
bipolar,fbc6uql,t1_fbc315t,1576717085.0,I almost associate this to racing thoughts

bipolar,f3sgm71,t3_dhzvoe,1571102517.0,"The problem is that spirituality can not heal something that is unhealable. There is not fix to bipolar, but it’s treatable. 

I went a long time without medication and I was fine untill it got really bad. 

If you can manage without medication and find comfort through other things then great. You do you. 

But if you become miserable and desperate then at least consider meds a possibility. Don’t let it ruin your life."
bipolar,f3sd8zx,t3_dhvr8d,1571100941.0,Every time I’ve told someone I am bipolar they say that I’m not because I “don’t have mood swings from one minute to the next and randomly get angry”.  People have such a misconception about what being bipolar really is.

depression,f3ris20,t3_dhuye8,1571088472.0,"That fear is keeping you alive for a reason. Keep fighting on.  I know that depression feels like being in a black room that’s locked from the outside. But take it fifteen minutes at a time. Set little goals for yourself. Brush your teeth. Take a shower. 

I feel for you. Keep fighting on."
AskReddit,f3rh267,t3_dho8b6,1571088039.0,Me and my fiancé went to sleep with him on the right side and me on the left side of the bed.  When we woke up we were on opposite sides of where we went to sleep. Neither of us can understand why and neither of us woke up in the middle of the night to pee. Most confusing thing EVER.
bipolar,f3rezsy,t3_dhrxha,1571087421.0,I had some issues with lammictal. I was having some memory loss and I felt dumber too. When I accidentally drove on the wrong side of the road one night I got so scared I called my psychiatrist to let her know I didn’t want to take it anymore. When I told her what I was experiencing she agreed that It wasn’t the right medicine for me. I would bring up how you feel to your psychiatrist.  There are other options out there if you don’t feel 100% about this medication.
BipolarReddit,f3ra2rj,t3_dhq9y3,1571085906.0,Personally the idea of telling my in-laws hasn’t even occurred to me. I honestly don’t think it’s any of their business. I don’t think you owe them that type of information.
bipolar,f3qtqby,t1_f3qtgxm,1571080630.0,"Thank you, it’s helpful hearing that from someone in his same position"
bipolar,f3q1rca,t3_dhpznd,1571068336.0,"Wow. Why so many? I’m not judging I just genuinely did not know some people have to take so many. Did your psychiatrist start off with one and built it up to this much based off your needs or was it this much from the get go? 

Regardless, I can see why you would be so frustrated. Wishing you the best."
bipolar,f3pvr4v,t3_dhongj,1571065735.0,Sometimes yes but sometimes no. This last time I actually thought I was going to go into a hypomaniac state because I was suddenly so hyper sexual but it turned out to be a depressive episode. It can be very unpredictable.
bipolar,f3n09y7,t3_dh5w8o,1570993749.0,"If you’re afraid that the medication will make you feel blunted and not like yourself, remember that there are so many medications that you can try. If one doesn’t make you feel right, let your doctor know and you’ll try something else until you find the right one. And do this unapologetically, because you deserve to feel stable. I’m getting back on latuda, which helps me feel normal without making me feel like I lost a part of yourself. For you it might be a different medication. 

I recently stopped taking my medication because I didn’t want to be one of those people who stays on It for ever (and my psychiatrist wanted it to be temporary too) and It was a huge mistake. I fell into a depressive episode and it reminded me why I was on medication in the first place. 

It really is a lifesaver. I suggest you give it a try :)"
bipolar,f3iexys,t3_dh42g0,1570935755.0,"I think that it’s common to receive different diagnoses before getting the right one. Especially because it takes a bit of time for a mental health professional to get a full picture of what’s going on. 

For me it was major depressive disorder + panic disorder then dysthymia then cyclothymia then bipolar"

bipolar,f37r1bn,t1_f37hel7,1570729245.0,"I was on Latuda for six months then weaned off of it because my psychiatrist only wanted it to be temporary. I’m now off of them for a month but it looks like I’m going to have to get back on them if I keep feeling this way.  I have an appointment in a couple of weeks. 

I’m glad to hear that the medication is allowing you to live a healthier life. I understand what it feels like to be a burden to your partner. I try to restrict how much I tell my fiancée because I don’t want my negativity to latch on to him. He’s been so fortunate to be mentally stable his whole life and I’d like to keep it that way. 

Congratulations on coming out of that abyss."
