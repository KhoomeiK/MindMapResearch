I take trileptal daily and i try to avoid xanax. but at this point, having it handy to quell the anxiety is sometimes necessary. I also go out and run when I feel overwhelmed, and/or do yoga. I change spots where I work many times a day, to have different moods/vibes. My boss knows I have a mood disorder and her dad had bipolar (i suspect she has some variant, also). So she treats me gently, but she's also relying on me hard, and I think i can tell when she's at a tipping point. most of us are feeling what you feel, you are not alone. Embrace the high energy days and just chug along on the less energy days. we are not perfect, don't beat yourself up. Oh, i also have to make sure i know the kind of day i'm having to manage caffeine accordingly. I only drink half regular, half decaf since the diagnosis. But even with tea later in the day, i need to think through whether it will just make my attention span worse."
bipolar2,fma4r5w,t3_ftrte4,1585883796.0,"I'm so sorry, guys. I am fortunate to be working from home and having to also educate my son while I'm working (alongside my husband who is also working from home), so I am kept very busy and therefore not upset about being socially isolated. But my illness is still there. I get hypo and try and take on the world, then get depressed and regret my previous enthusiasm that put this load of work on me. Most of the time I don't fear death, which was definitely a turning point for me. I just think there is no ""winning"" when you have a mood disorder. You just try and keep going, and appreciate the little pleasures when they come. This sucks for everyone, mood disorder or no. But there are always people who have it worse. Hang in there, we will get through it!"
bipolar2,fma48qd,t3_ftyg94,1585883430.0,"How many episodes in are you? It certainly made me think I am definitely not BP 1. It was an interesting plot point for this series, and it gets much deeper, definitely worth watching. I just came off watching season 7 of Homeland, another bipolar TV character I like to compare and contrast my case against. There's this scene with Helen and Wendy about Ben's illness that I want to talk about, but I finished the season, so don't want to spoil anything!"
bipolar2,fma3viz,t3_fu037f,1585883166.0,"Depends on the medicine, I think. I opted for a super low dose of a pretty mild medicine because I am concerned, sure. What I take certainly affects my memory, I forget obvious words all the time. But oh well."
bipolar2,fma3k22,t3_ftslhy,1585882939.0,"It's certainly possible. The world is pretty fucked up, and somehow this just feels like an asinine way to go down. We probably won't go extinct from this, but definitely we may see some medicine shortages. I mean, and all the other terrible things such as death and millions of lost jobs. As they say, it's always darkest just before the dawn, I'm praying for that dawn."
bipolar2,fma33sy,t3_fty6bl,1585882626.0,"I completely relate, but same as another response below, what else are you going to do it you're not continuing with what you started? I mean sure, nobody is going to be at their best, people are going to half ass or 1/8 ass everything. Hopefully they will give you pass/fail options for this quarter (I'm in grad school part time and they gave us this option last quarter, but I am hoping it might be available for this next quarter). The social isolation crisis will end eventually. Who knows what anything looks like after that. But we still keep on keeping on, because...well, hope, i guess? Pollution levels are way down, that's one positive thing, right?"

bipolar2,fma2leq,t3_fttkzt,1585882268.0,"My husband and I are both working from home, and trying to home school my 6 year old. I have accepted that the education he gets is what it is. It will be very inferior, I am not a teacher. And my work expectations and demanding, i can't devote my day to his education. But chances are, he will be just fine (contracting COVID notwithstanding, hoping this social isolation is not for nothing). You are doing what you can, pitching in. I know it's hard and impossible, but education wise, your niece will be fine. This COVID crisis blows. Play games with them that you think are educational, that you also enjoy. Have them look out the window and draw things they like. Eventually this will end, we can get through it. One way I get through this is counting  on the fact that I don't have to make plans with anyone for a long time. For some reason, that thought brings me stability. It sounds like you have a routine, but you have no choice in it. Change is hard but it gets easier. Hang in there!"

BipolarReddit,fkoakhr,t3_fjhbt6,1584383361.0,"I've been very hypo, but as a Bernie supporter in a state with a primary tomorrow, it's not just COVID. The climate crisis is likely to create situations like this - potentially much worse. It's a slow mo train wreck and the stupidity and short-sightedness of people astounds me. I'm going to ask my psychiatrist for a refill on xanax. But  ultimately, we should treat this as a pilot for future scenarios. If and when things get worse, i have determined i won't worry about my medication. Meditation, breathing exercises. Practice, practice!"

I wound up on a Biden thread on Twitter, it was asking people if they will vote for Biden and everyone was chiming in, of course, vote blue no matter who. so i decided to weigh in, letting folks know they are in an echo chamber, but many people won't vote Biden unless he does something extreme like supports M4A. shockingly, i haven't been attacked - yet. but before i realized i was following too many Biden supporters, i was jumped on all the time."
SandersForPresident,fkbvfga,t1_fkbn3fg,1584040634.0,"I think Bloomberg and Buttigieg have teamed up to lose votes with their tech companies, Shadow and Hawkfish. And this could be pretty unpatrolled with internal party primaries, but harder to do successfully with a general election. but i am watching a lot of Homeland right now, so maybe i'm just imagining sabotage where it isn't there?"

SandersForPresident,fkayqhk,t1_fkaugb2,1584022504.0,"There was clearly voter suppression with the lines in precincts with young voters. But I also think since the Biden team now has Buttigieg on their side, they have mastered other techniques. My 30,000 foot take is that there are a lot more Dallases that have not been uncovered. I think it's very fishy.

ClimateOffensive,fff4o4d,t1_ffeemud,1579875606.0,"Yep, was in Iowa canvassing last weekend. I don't know if people don't believe climate crisis will f-ck up our lives royally (even some Australians still deny that climate change led to their plight), or if they aren't afraid of that reality. I waffle between shouting very loudly, trying to wake people up (stating that Bernie's platform as the best shot we have), or just trying to adopt their fearless attitude of not being afraid of death or a terrible life of shortage and disease - dying from some slow, painful death, I guess. Neither strategy is working, however."

WomensHealth,faayx06,t1_f9rfemc,1575915442.0,"Ha, I can imagine! I only have one child, via adoption. I have an abnormal uterus and with the cyst issues, never pursued artificial means to get pregnant, and it never happened naturally. When you had the total hysterectomy, had you hit menopause? I am not sure if I can go on hormone replacement therapy b/c my mom has a blood clot gene which I will soon get tested for. But if hormone replacement therapy is an option, I would like to know about people's experiences if they did it before menopause. I still have many years to go before the avg age of menopause."

I read a study about transvaginal cyst removal, but neither my OBGYN nor the first surgeon has mentioned it as an option. Since I had the other two abdominal laproscopies (spleen removal and cyst removal), it seems like that would be a good idea (though the cysts in my ovary are huge, the ovary is like 12 cm)."
