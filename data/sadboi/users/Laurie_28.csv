But communication will have to be key. If he doesn’t express a need to take breaks, you may need to be the one that initiates this during sexy times."

Divorce,f8docae,t3_e0blh1,1574501502.0,"Old habits die hard. 

I accidentally called my ex husband a month after divorce because he was always my go-to when I needed to tell someone how great my day was. And funny thing, I was the one who initiated divorce and wanted to move on. It’s hard and you were together for a long time. But it will take someone to have the will power to start ending these types of conversations and start moving on. Hang in there OP and take care of yourself."
medical,f7naktr,t1_f7n6v72,1573892363.0,👆🏻yup! All about how you use it. Best sex I’ve ever had was with a smaller guy.
medical,f6rwzwd,t1_f6rvs8g,1573121501.0,Please go see a doctor and have them check it out. You are clearly concerned since this has had 3 different posts in an hour and the doctor will be able to explain it.
pokemongo,f4p5pao,t1_f4p5feq,1571716822.0,I live in ABQ too and wouldn’t wander anywhere that late at night into any park - just be careful.

GERD,etrzc21,t3_cd39bh,1563132652.0,"Just an FYI Ranitidine is prescription strength Zantac. Depending on the severity of your GERD and what your doctor recommends, you may be able to do with just OTC Zantac or you’ll have to have a prescription. 

If they don’t find anything, it may be worth your time to try figuring out which foods don’t make you feel good. Start with rice and slowly start to add on to it. A lot of your symptoms sound like my gluten issues, but I’m also not a doctor so that may not be it."
