Not only mental health also physical. I can link them if you like although maybe that would be kinda stressful for you... 


Personally, I haven't been able to sleep before the 4/5AM and have been having very realistic nightmares/dreams at 6 AM too its honestly tiring. I can go back to sleep after and hour or so. 


Idk if you wanted advice on sleeping techniques but I find listening to a podcast or music at a low level helps. Idk I feel like if I'm straining to hear it I get tired of it and fall asleep. It works sometimes."

I can relate to a lot of what you said. He knows I love him. I even pleaded to give us another chance. Although now in hindsight I dont want to be with him anymore. But I do miss the calmness like you said.  Talking to him was my happy place and everything felt okay and I was loved (the past tense still hurts me...). 


Also yeah HATE being in quarantine and heartbroken! I wish we could go out and live life and try to heal but we are stuck inside thinking."

Right!! I could be working my jobs and talking to all these people.  We could be living out life but no pandemic, death, and despair everywhere!! It's just exacerbating our pain.


For hobbies I reccomend crocheting! Or maybe learn something new on YouTube. Or finding new artists I recommend [Jackie Venson ](https://open.spotify.com/album/4BT5txfrTsxlXpoRVTx8QX?si=BoLNz0T-TSazRY6nLCGfgA)"

He broke up with me, he said I argued too much and he has a temper and just ignored me when I wanted to talk like hello helping anyone 🙄 he said we can be friends but it feels different and the replys are vaguer. I just miss him. I just want it to be normal (not even dating I'm done with him romantically) but from these comments it seems like its not an option. That hurts."
beyonce,fn4e57e,t1_fn4dqhz,1586639522.0,Yeah but your original statement puts blame on the person being cheated on. I'm not saying their cant be blame but I think there are choices before hurting someone like that yk?

beyonce,fn4c51f,t1_fn4bk0v,1586638342.0,Why do you think it's her fault though? No matter how great of a partner you are if you get cheated on it's that person's fault (this case jay z). It was their own insecurities and issues that led them to be disloyal. Sure be a great partner but dont blame yourself/or the person that was cheated on that just drive you crazy and create more insecurities.
