AskReddit,eoye7kd,t3_btgna3,1558938875.0,"I was 19 and living in Hawaii with my really good friend. We were just living there for the summer, so we didn‚Äôt purchase a car. Our main way of getting around was taking the bus. We didn‚Äôt have a lot of money, and we would get sick of constantly having to wait for the bus and having to pay for bus pass‚Äôs. 

In Hawaii, it is legal to ride in the beds of trucks. We were living in a surfer house Airbnb and they told us a lot of people hitchhiked. We had started to get a little too comfortable with hitchhiking. We would meet a lot of people and make friends, and we thought we were so ‚Äúcool‚Äù for doing so.

It was our last night and we had a flight home early the next day. The sun sets pretty early in Hawaii, and we were having dinner at our favorite food truck when it had started to get dark. At this point, our phones had been dead for about an hour and it was basically dark. We decided to hitchhike one last time to get home.

I always carried a huge beach bag around with me, it held my towel and everything we need for the day. I also had some takeout dinner for one of our friends back at our Airbnb for a departure gift. 

So, we were about 3 miles from our home. There‚Äôs a popular beach about half a mile down the road from where we lived and we were always dropped off there to be safe. We went on the road and we weren‚Äôt having any luck. All of a sudden, a small pickup truck pulls over faster than anyone had before. There were a few construction materials in the bed of the truck. A man in his 40‚Äôs got out of the truck that looked like a surf bum from California. 

He offered for us to get in the cab, but we declined and told him we could make room in the bed. He was very pushy about us getting in the cab, but we told him it was ok and we could make room. After we got in we told him to drop us off at this beach. 

While we‚Äôre driving, he starts talking with someone over the phone. Couldn‚Äôt hear the conversation. We get to the beach, and he‚Äôs taking long than usual to pull over. Thought it was strange but I was thinking he‚Äôd maybe stop at the end? WRONG.

He quickly makes a right turn and starts driving up a dark, steep hill. At this point we‚Äôre freaked out. He continues to drive faster and faster, and there weren‚Äôt a lot of houses around. We start pounding on the back window telling him he can drop us off now, but nothing. We‚Äôre yelling at him, pounding, nothing. Great.
Phones are dead. Last night here. Literally no one Knows where we are. 

About 5-8 minutes of this and he starts to pull into a gated home. Luckily he had slowed down enough pulling in for us to jump out. I had a bunch of shit in my hands but I‚Äôve never ran faster In my Birkenstock‚Äôs before. 

I wanted to think he maybe had just forgotten about us, but how could you forgot you had 2 girls in the bed of your truck for only driving about a mile and a half? We made it home and he didn‚Äôt follow us but it spooked me enough to never hitchhike again."
