Lyme,fr3qknp,t1_fr3pptz,1589863601.0,"Thanks for this info. Since my post, my health has improved in many ways despite going back to my old diet (eating gluten and cheese for instance). I no longer have the crushing fatigue, muscle spasms, horrible pains at night, etc. I don’t know if time healed things or the combo of supplements did. For the record all I’m taking right now is Emergen-C, Florastor, Ashwagandha, and a mushroom supplement. If I could get rid of my ear issues I’d be mostly back to good health. My right ear in particular is very sensitive to certain frequencies and it along with the tinnitus can be very uncomfortable and distressing."

The idea of such a high balance on a checking account just makes me nervous. My thinking has always been if someone gets hold of my debit card I don’t want them to be able to withdraw more than a few thousand dollars so I only keep enough in my checking to cover bills and move the rest into a money market account.

I like tracking things so I’ve kept a spreadsheet to see how much my little 10 lb dog has cost me the past three years and it just hit $6000! She hasn’t needed any major surgery either, but that total includes spaying when she was a puppy, vaccinations, food, two dental cleanings, grooming every three months, and just initial supplies like a crate and toys. It takes her 6 months to go through a 22 lb bag of food at $60 and we don’t go crazy with treats so it’s just amazing to me how everything has still added up. Heart worm and flea/tick medication alone is expensive though. Plus it’s $50 just to see the vet before factoring in actual vaccines or bloodwork.

Losing your child is just so horrible to imagine. 

On a side note - it’s always bothered me when there’s a plane crash where everyone dies and a person who was supposed to be on the flight talks about how God was looking out for them. It’s as if they’re saying God didn’t give a crap about the 100+ people who DID die. It’s just so callous."

But anyway, my advice is to find fun things to do on the weekends. Not only does it give you something to look forward to during your work week, but doing new things (and making new memories) stops time from going by too quickly and having all the days blend together. Some ideas: try a new restaurant, attend a meet up, host a game night, see a movie, check out a forest preserve, volunteer, visit family, attend a concert/sporting event, borrow a movie/CD/book from the library, etc. Also, Facebook has a list of local events and I'm sure you'd find something that interests you.

I’m so glad we didn’t do it because a) we don’t necessarily go on a big vacation every year, b) we didn’t want to be limited to where we could stay, and c) we’re frugal and there’s no way that timeshare would have saved us money. On top of that, when I got home I learned anyone could book rooms at the original property they showed us anyway so why not just do that when you felt like going?

savedyouaclick,ffrk0he,t3_euquuw,1580159599.0,Never had a problem with the fries there but the last two times I went the burgers just weren't good anymore. Not sure what changed but they quickly went from my favorite burger place to never going there again. Switched to Culvers instead. Their kids meal is a great deal btw.
