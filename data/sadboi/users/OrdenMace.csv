socialanxiety,fi516sm,t1_fi3kelk,1582152681.0,"My strategy is this:
Set a timer for 5 minutes.
Get in shower facing forward and turn it on.
Count to 10 and turn 90 degrees.
Repeat until all 4 sides are done.
Repeat again but raise arms to get under armpits.
If you have a removable shower head spend 30 seconds on each leg from front to back.
By this point you should be somewhat acclimatized to the cold, another minute and it won't even feel that cold anymore, spend the rest of the time under the shower until the alarm rings.

I've been doing this ritual every day for a while now and I actually really enjoy it. The cold is like a hard reset for my mind and my body feels great for hours once I'm out. The counting takes your mind off the cold during the uncomfortable early stages and the timer is short enough that you won't give up but long enough to get the benefits of a cold shower. It's also really nice to turn up the heat in your room/house before you start so you can look forward to the comfort of warming back up."

AskReddit,ewhz696,t3_cofqw9,1565430376.0,"""Do everything you can while you're young"" or something to that effect. It's possibly the worst advice I was ever given. My mother would say things like that when talking about a lot of things like traveling the world, skydiving etc. This might sound like good advise but my family never went on holidays or did anything exciting, and we lived in very rural places where nothing ever happened. It made me feel like I was wasting my childhood and that that was somehow my fault. As a young adult it's made me act without thinking about the consequences. I've almost ended up homeless spending money on shit that doesn't make me happy or give my life any real meaning. 

My mother would also say things like ""You learn better while you're young"" especially regarding things like learning a language or instrument. Again her advise sounds good on the surface. As an ADHD ridden child with a host of learning disabilities, I never had a good teacher and failed at everything I tried to learn. It made me feel stupid and again like I was wasting my youth. It's important to value learning but I was never really shown how to go about it. I was never really encouraged or guided on how to learn or given projects. I remember one time as a kid I really wanted to learn to make a video game. My mother basically did a quick search on our dial up internet and came back to me saying all she found was ""naughty websites"" and that was the end of it. Making a game isn't something a kid can do easily, but she could have encouraged me to start simple, maybe making a board game. She could have helped me to learn basic programming or got me books on the subject. All I got were ""naughty sites"" I couldn't visit.


When I grew into a teen and had full access to the internet I tried to learn everything, tried to force myself to learn out of fear of the ticking clock. If I couldn't learn something now how was I going to when I'm older? But forcing yourself to learn and having a poor sense of how to organise myself meant that any failure was a hit to my self esteem. Learning became a chore and a constant reminder that I had little time. I'm in my 20s now and have very few real skills."
