BPDmemes,fnpz1v7,t1_fnd5g14,1587154608.0,So close
unpopularopinion,fnpysxc,t1_fn8n0ki,1587154474.0,Same lol. I don't want the whole world to see me sobbing. Also how unstable to you have to be to just sob uncontrollably like that?
unpopularopinion,fnpyo3o,t1_fn8avxt,1587154403.0,It's honestly embarrassing for them
dating_advice,fn84u2n,t1_fn8214j,1586733925.0,I'm having the opposite sort of response. I think maybe I'm better and happier alone.
BorderlinePDisorder,fn7qn1y,t1_fn7qlhu,1586725662.0,I'm right there with you. It really sucks.
BPD,fn7qhqi,t1_fn7q34s,1586725576.0,"It's not an ""official"" term or anything, but I've definitely heard it in those contexts lol. Happy to find someone else who relates :)"
BorderlinePDisorder,fn7qe3b,t1_fn7q2k3,1586725518.0,"Yeah, that is super frustrating."
unpopularopinion,fn7qbp5,t3_g00r9m,1586725480.0,"My parents did this to me multiple times growing up. My dad also read my diary when I was like 15 and I got into huge trouble for some very private, personal thoughts I had written out. Got in trouble every time they read my texts, too. My parents also went through my purse after my freshmen year of college and found a lighter and papers and I got chewed out for that, too. Mind you, I was an adult for that last one. It has fucked me up forever."
unpopularopinion,fn7pwv7,t3_fzz1v9,1586725244.0,"I've never understood why anyone records themselves crying and posts it. Like, why?"
BorderlinePDisorder,fn7pr4y,t3_g02udm,1586725155.0,"One thing I've found helpful is just being honest about how I feel, rather than hoping that they pick up on it. So here, I'd say something like, ""I understand and it happens, but I had been looking forward to seeing you and I feel a little disappointed now. Do you think you can make some time for me later? I'd still like to see you."""
OCPoetry,fn7pi2w,t3_g028i4,1586725014.0,"I like the sentiment and the emotion in this, but I might rework some of the metaphors. I think you relied a little too much on cliches and it makes some of the poem feel a little obvious. Reworking them to be a bit more opaque might be a nice exercise."
dating_advice,fn7p7nk,t3_g00795,1586724848.0,Dating in general is kinda depressing tbh.
BPD,fn7p2vx,t1_fn77cf6,1586724772.0,"Thanks! It's a term that some therapists use when they think a client has features of BPD, but they aren't sure if they'd meet full-criteria because they either haven't done enough assessment yet or they think the person is ""too high-functioning"" to have BPD (which is a total misconception, you can have BPD, be objectively very successful, and still be suffering). It basically means BPD-ish."
BPDmemes,fn7osly,t1_fn72ke3,1586724607.0,You got it! Lol.
mentalillness,fn6uqij,t3_fzw8zn,1586707736.0,Dude I feel this.
TalkTherapy,fn6umfw,t3_fzygpv,1586707672.0,I totally had this problem. I cried once and it was when she was trying to help me organize my planner and I just got super overwhelmed and frustrated by the amount of work I had. It wasn't even a real cry. It was a tear or two.
TalkTherapy,fn6tc62,t3_fzq5e0,1586706944.0,"Yeah, therapists are human. They make mistakes. If every session is a bad session, then that's a red flag, but even the best therapists have off days. I think you shouldn't say that you want to quit, because they might take that at face value. Have you had a session since then? Sometimes, a therapist will leave the session also feeling like, ""oh man that was bad,"" and during the next one they'll open the session with a discussion of the last session, how you feel about it, and an apology and correction. If you haven't had another session yet, that might happen. And if not, you should try to bring it up next time. Just be honest and tell them how their reaction made you feel. It's important for them to know."
TalkTherapy,fn6stej,t3_fzsnlc,1586706646.0,"I think it's totally fine to ask, but I might phrase it as like, ""I think it would help me to maintain my progress if I had something concrete from an outside observer who has seen my progress that I can look back on to remind myself of how far I've come. It would help me get through times when I start to doubt myself."""
relationship_advice,fn6slmh,t3_fzup8m,1586706525.0,What. The. Fuck.
BPD,fn6s2yc,t3_fzwrh9,1586706230.0,I love doing this but I don't dump them. I end up getting attached after much convincing and then they dump me. Lol.
BPDmemes,fn6rl71,t3_fzjj75,1586705947.0,Oh hey I don't wanna upvote today
BPDmemes,fn6resq,t3_fzv8sd,1586705843.0,Jfc this is me
SuicideWatch,flx9l28,t3_fr9ofe,1585578367.0,"You don't have to enjoy life to not be suicidal. Sometimes just being curious about whether or not things will get better has been enough to keep me going. That or remembering that my cat would think I abandoned him or my best friend would forever feel damaged and guilty or my mom would never be the same. Sometimes remembering that I help other people and want to do something with my life is enough. I haven't been suicidal in a while and I think it's because I took suicide off the table for myself and started focusing on reasons for living. At first, you still wanna die, but eventually you stop wanting to die. The reasons don't even have to be ""good"" reasons or big reasons. It could just be like, ""Well that movie is coming out soon and I'd really like to see it before I die,"" or, ""I just bought a new dishwasher. I'd like to get some use out of that first."" If you can build a habit of looking for reasons to live, you'll stop finding reasons to die."
slaa,flx90a8,t3_fr993w,1585578002.0,"I'm in a similar place with figuring out whether I need this or not. Way more of a love and attention addict than a sex addict. I think I have a pretty healthy attitude towards sex, but not love. I've gone to a few in-person meetings (before the quarantine) and a handful of phone meetings. But idk. I have found sharing helpful but there's such a lack of guidance. Idk if I really get anything from it. I don't know what my bottom lines are, so I don't know what sobriety looks like for me. I have a lot of issues with the whole higher power thing. And I just don't know. Sometimes it feels a little culty."
BPD,fhz22m3,t3_f5ibyp,1581989082.0,I have this problem too. It feels like they have no respect for my time. It really only bothers me if they don't give me any notice.
BPD,fhxmasa,t3_f594hl,1581957545.0,"At some point for me, it becomes to much and I can feel the most horrible, accurate, hateful statements forming in my mouth. Sometimes I just have to let it fly and (unfortunately) it feels so fucking good. Other times, I try to hold it in, then some half assed, pathetic-mean thing comes out and the other person is like, ""yeah okay good one lol."" And that is frustrating because it's like, ""do you want me to hurt you? Because trust me I can."" I wish I didn't get as angry as I do."
