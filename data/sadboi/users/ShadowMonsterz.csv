My mother would do a lot of the same thing, she would examine my naked body and point out how big my boobs and butt were were getting, walk in on me showering, laugh at me and point it out to my grandma whenever she found sanitary products in the bathroom, constantly need to be informed of when i had my period. I was only allowed to use products certified by her, which meant I could only use pantiliners which weren‚Äôt nearly enough. She would make me change in front of her and if I told her I was uncomfortable with it she would get angry, saying we were both girls and I was supposed to be comfortable with it. She told my grandma that my pubic hair looked like a forest, and that I had been trimming it ‚Äúlike a prostitute‚Äù. To this day anything remotely related to femininity makes me extremely uncomfortable. I hate the word woman because it would make me so uncomfortable when my mom referred to me as one. My mom always talked about like it was a normal thing, i was a girl and she was a girl so therefore we were supposed to talk about this stuff together. I don‚Äôt know why, i just supposed other girls and their moms were comfortable with this kinda talk and that it just made me feel uncomfortable.

(Not that the coronavirus isn‚Äôt serious and causing many deaths, we definitely aren‚Äôt doing enough to slow the spread quite yet) This happens as a result of the method doctors use to document the cause of death on death certificates. If anyone dies during these times with the slightest suspicion of a COVID-19 infection it is stated that the death is COVID-19 related even if it is by other causes because at the moment we do not have the capacity to perform a full autopsy for everyone who dies. Sometimes it‚Äôs not even doctors making this call, it‚Äôs close family members or the funeral offices. Someone dying of coronavirus is different from someone dying with coronavirus.
