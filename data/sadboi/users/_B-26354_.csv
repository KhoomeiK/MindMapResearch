BipolarReddit,fj3zyrf,t1_fj39ynx,1582997095.0,"Agree that most people aren't looking for deep or meaningful relationships.

BipolarReddit,fgudux8,t3_f0g3m8,1581118401.0,"I get overwhelmed at times as well. Occasionally I convince myself that I should really pay less attention to the news and kind of tune out. But, at the same time, I care deeply about the future of the country and I feel a responsibility to stay informed (also struggle with legit screen addiction)

After 2016 I quit watching cable news. It's ""infotainment,"" not news, and it's all garbage. I stick to major newspapers for legitimate, fact-based information. I also avoid echo chambers online for a whole variety of reasons (too much doom and gloom, for one). Political discussions with friends/family are risky, so I steer clear of that like the plague.

And now I've turned off news app notifications on my phone. It was always bad news and beginning to be too much. So now I'll check the news when I'm prepared to do so. The next 9 months are going to be hell. I'm trying to dig in now and prepare."

BipolarReddit,f624ez9,t3_dq9fjg,1572653146.0,"Thank you for posting! I have the same sensitivity issues with medications. The lowest dose of Depakote caused problems for me. I'm currently taking half of a 20mg Latuda (and was on similarly small doses of Vraylar and Abilify, previously). And I take only 600mg lithium per day with a blood level of about .4-5.

This has caused huge problems in finding the best medications to get me stable. It's been 2 years now since I was officially diagnosed. The weird part is that I was never this sensitive to medications until an SSRI fully brought out bipolar symptoms that led to my diagnosis.

My doctor says it's liver enzymes and how I metabolize things. But I don't understand how that's possible since this is a new thing. In any case I'm pretty close to requesting the Genesight test along with their MTHFR test"

bipolar,f3vc6hd,t1_f3vbk4c,1571174208.0,Interesting. I had a similar reaction to Vraylar where I slowly began to have crippling panic attacks. I'd never had panic attacks before so it took me awhile to figure it out. They went away after I went off of it. It's not as bad with the Latuda.

BipolarReddit,f3ucn74,t3_di8yd7,1571157503.0,"Lamictal was the first drug I was on where  I noticed significant cognitive impairment. So we tried lithium next. Honestly, for me it's just as bad. We're pretty sure that I also have underlying inattentive ADHD, for which I've never been treated. So the bipolar meds are probably making that worse.

It sucks. Lithium helps me but my concentration and focus and executive functions are pretty well shot. It takes about a half hour sometimes to settle into reading a book."

So the flip side is that its risks are are much better understood than other drugs, like the atypical anti-psychotics in particular. Literally all medications have risks and the potential for side effects."

Umm, what? How are mood stabilizers toxic? Not trying to argue with you but I've literally never heard or read anything like this. Also, benzos are highly addictive and can worsen symptoms if used long term."
BipolarReddit,f22od2l,t3_dbgdgd,1569893079.0,"> Do I have to get Blood Tests? If so, how often?

I had comprehensive blood work done prior to starting lithium. I think it was complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, urinalysis, and some thyroid stuff. I've been on it for a few months and have had 2 or 3 level checks. I think we're doing the comprehensive blood work every 6 months.

> Is there anything I need to be aware/avoid on Lithium? I was told it was okay to have a drink after 2.5 hours of taking it.

Ask your doctor for clarification on these, but: don't take ibuprofen/NSAIDS regularly, eat a ""normal"" amount of table salt in your diet, drink plenty of water per day (~2L).

Also, be very careful in the heat not to get dehydrated! This will cause your lithium blood level to rise. I can't speak for anyone else but I've found that this can happen very easily. It's happened 2 or 3 times this summer when I was on a higher dose, and was never serious enough for me to go to the ER, but I learned a lesson. Stay ahead of this and hydrate beforehand if you're going to be in the heat and know the signs of dehydration and lithium toxicity (extreme case).

Definitely report any issues to your doctor. **Stay hydrated** and be careful in the heat. I've had issues with this and it got away from me a few times when I was outdoors. I never got toxic but it did raise my level and sort of knock me down for about 24h. Also, always get the lab work done."
BipolarReddit,f094q5z,t1_f08bkuk,1568493915.0,"Not really. Lithium, so far, has been the only mood stabilizer I've been on where I noticed any real improvement (in my bipolar symptoms). I take it, another mood stabilizer, and Latuda as well. But we still don't have everything dialed in perfectly.

I've tried asking to my psychiatrist about the sensitivity issues and how I was never this way before (especially with medications). He just kind of brushes it off as liver enzymes and how I metabolize things or whatever. I'd like to go see an endocrinologist but my health insurance at the moment isn't so great."

So I've been trying to write down the things I know I need to get done, whether daily or even just weekly. A lot of people try to do things on their phones these days. And while I do use an online calendar for appointments, etc. I think writing things down is helpful for remembering/prioritizing. And crossing completed items off the list helps me feel like I accomplished something. Even if it's not a big deal.

This is something I started doing recently. I use generic legal pads because they're cheap. I'm trying to make it a new habit, either in the morning or the night before."
BipolarReddit,f05hbeo,t3_d3knh1,1568409766.0,"I'm on 600mg/day and this has been a problem for me as well. I'm also new to taking lithium having started it only recently. At one point I was on 900mg/day and I was getting dehydrated way too easily.

So I've been keeping at least a dozen or so 20oz sugar-free sports drinks on hand. I only drink them after exercising or doing something else intensive in the heat. It's helped along with remembering to drink more water to begin with. But I think, at least for me, there's also dealing with the fact that my limits are different than what they used to be. For instance, mowing the lawn in the afternoon in 80-90F heat is a bad idea now no matter how much I've hydrated or how many breaks I take. It was never an issue before. And spending time in the outdoors for hours on end in the heat? Also a bad idea, even if I'm not really doing anything and am hydrating throughout.

BipolarReddit,evaugjc,t1_ev8uzgf,1564357552.0,"> that is not how you erase stigma or improve understanding. i am very open about my bipolar disorder and i don't think there is anything wrong with that.

And that's *your* choice to be open about it. But don't pretend like you aren't taking risks in doing so. Especially if you openly discuss being bipolar with co-workers. I know from personal experience that this can have serious negative consequences. Co-workers are *work* friends, which makes them very different from *real* friends. Though, yes, sometimes the two can overlap.

Whom we disclose being bipolar to can have real consequences. So don't completely discount what Sociofunetic said because he/she technically has a point just as valid as yours.

BipolarReddit,ev81ash,t3_cii8da,1564267428.0,"A friendly warning: the second time I was on Abilify, *after* finally being diagnosed BP, I began to have some compulsive spending issues. Kind of like a manic thing where I'd get into something and have to spend waaay more than was necessary. Thankfully I noticed pretty quickly that something was off. I mentioned it to my doctor and we transitioned to something else.

I learned afterwards that I learned that this is [a known issue](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/fda-drug-safety-communication-fda-warns-about-new-impulse-control-problems-associated-mental-health) with Abilify. So maybe something to keep an eye on."

This. Telling co-workers is super risky. Because there are friends and there are work friends. Work friends are people we have to be around because, like everyone else, we need a paycheck. And no matter how great work friends may seem, people can still be petty and stupid."
