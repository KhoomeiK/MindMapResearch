WorldOfTanksBlitz,fmn2x8f,t3_fw9pui,1586217084.0,"The game started off with me scouting the hills side of Middleburg with only one AMX. I drove down the hill to join my teammates telling the TDs to be aware of a possible flank. My whole team was focus firing on an IS3 Defender and it died pretty quickly. However, the enemy tanks had swarmed around our heavies and they went down quickly as well. By then, it was a 4 v 6. The ISU hit our LTTB and the enemy heavies took it down quickly, so then it became a 3v6 with me being the only light tank. I believe three other enemy tanks went down around this time but I was focus firing so I wasn't paying attention to them. Our JPanther got out dpm'd by an E25 but thankfully he reduced the E25 down to around 500. The E25 destroyed the T34 on my team and now it was a 1v3. The E25 was hovering around 290 health and I rolled high on the HE and one shotted him. The AMX 13 90 came out and got one shot on me but he was at 110 health so he was a one shot too. Now it was a 1v1 against a full health FCM 50t. I was at about 900 health. I don't think the FCM knew what he was doing, but I got four AP shots into his side and got him down to 600, both slightly low rolls. He got two shots into me too so I was down to 400. By sheer luck, I got two engine fires into a row and he died. I wish I could get a replay but it says Error Code 119"

mechmarket,fkletzx,t1_fkl87eb,1584304795.0,"That is technically correct. There are two categories of gasket mounting: sandwich gasket, and true gasket or PCB gasket. Sandwich gasket is just sandwich mount with foam strips on the mounting points. True gasket is what the old Korean customs used to use. There would be a rubber ring going around the entire bottom of the case that the PCB would rest on. The plate would not be in contact with the case. There is a hybrid PCB gasket mount where the PCB rests on standoffs with o rings on the standoffs."
