Anger,fo39e55,t3_g47ex2,1587482971.0,"I moved with my bf a year ago and was in the same spot you were. I think feeling trapped makes me angrier. And if you two only spend time with each other, maybe alone time would be useful and restorative. Are there things you consider relaxing, in general? Like a shower will always be relaxing to me. My bed will always be relaxing to me. Nature. Etc. Do those things even when you're not angry so that your base level is lower and it will take more to frustrate you rather than already being irritable and then 1 more thing on top of that sets you over the edge. 

Also if it's getting to a point where you're pushing at him and stuff (been there) he needs to leave the situation for the time being. Staying around usually doesnt seem to help, not in my case. I used to just leave the house and go for a drive(I'm actually sitting in my car right now). One of you needs to remove yourselves for the cooling off period to happen. If he has more self control in the moment that may be up to him to recognize and see that it's time to cool down. If you can do it and remove yourself though then of course you should. 

You cant really stop the anger in its tracks, I find it's like a hot stove burner - even if you turn it off it's still hot and you can still get burned, it takes time to cool off. But it can easily get hotter if you turn the heat up, quicker than it can cool off."

For me the healing has included showing up whether I feel it in my heart to do that or not. Like not in a bad way but if I'm carrying fear in my heart I show up anyway and show my brain over and over again that people can be good and that I'm safe. It's really really hard and I'll still self isolate for no real reason other than fear. But it's gotten better. I hope it gets better for you soon."

CPTSD,fmlgxl1,t3_fvr6nu,1586186194.0,"Let go of your anger? Ha...... ok. Good advice except not really. Super dismissive. OWN YOUR ANGER. It has to be put into a drive for self-progress, for making right what was done wrong to you, it will help you have the energy to do things for yourself because no one else did. That's so far the best way that I've found to put anger to use. Exercise is helpful, yoga is healing. Sit with your anger and give it a space to be seen, not denied... make angry art if you're into that. Sometimes if you sit with your anger it will turn into tears. You do not have to let your anger go, usually that applies when the anger is unjustified and childlike (you couldnt get the flavor of ice cream you wanted? Let it go) NOT when it relates to being neglected. This is something that you've left unacknowledged and it's saying, ""hey!!! I'm still here and I'm still ******* mad!!!!!"" Don't push it down even further when it's trying to release (by being worked through, not by just 'letting it go' lol ask them if they would tell their depressed patients to let their sadness go)

I've had to make a point to tell therapists word for word ""please take my anger seriously"". Idk if you're a woman but I am, and I go to women counselors, and I have a suspicion that because of that it makes them take it less seriously. When you're traumatized they know that theres a lot of emotional dysregulation and that can be calmed once the trauma is worked through, so maybe they just have the mindset of ""if we keep working through the trauma itself then the byproduct of anger will go away"". So I get it from that perspective. But like I said, if you treat depression the sadness will be lifted... doesn't mean you can't directly work with the sadness and find ways to cope and heal."

You were set up to seek out that type of situation, and even if you weren't, you were too young to know better while he wasn't.

adultsurvivors,fmda56h,t3_fu0s46,1585962819.0,"It's coming from a place of care for you. She will hate the people who hurt you so badly (even if there were good times-you know they did something very bad and did not have a good impact on you overall). She will never want them to have any of your care, love, fondness, she will never want to think about you missing them or grieving over them. To her it only makes sense to celebrate their pain, the way they so blatantly ignored the pain you would experience your entire life, while they ignored your innocence, autonomy, everything. She won't support them and I understand her not wanting to ""support"" you feeling anything other than the hatred she feels for them.

I would just try to explain things logically - trauma makes things get mixed up and complicated. You said so yourself that he groomed you, so naturally, grooming works the way it does for a reason. It makes the child feel special, loved, even safe, etc. That was a real experience for you just like the bad parts were, so isn't it even confusing for you sometimes?? Idk for me it is VERY confusing that I love and care for the people that messed me up so bad so I understand it when others are confused too. Just ask for her support for your general emotions rather than the reasoning behind them, because again, this is a trauma and isn't easy or you just 'missing an ex' or something like that. It's entirely different. Someone else said not talking too too much about the trauma to their s/o and I respect that. No one will ever really be able to fully understand your experiences but therapy is the closest you can come to that kind of healing. She can't heal your trauma but she should be able to hold you while you cry, listen to you without judgement. If she can do that for you then I don't think you have to make her 'understand' anything because most likely she won't, and that's okay"
adultsurvivors,fmd8sa6,t3_fuemrb,1585961913.0,"This was 100% abusive and part of you did recognize it as such. Your response of shaking without feeling much anxiety is a common trauma response.

I'm really sorry for what you went through and I can't believe your parents reacted that way... to me that is still neglectful (emotionally at minimum) and you had no way to process what happened. So the confusion on your part makes a whole lot of sense... no one ever tried to help you make sense of it!! I'm sorry you were failed by so many adults.

It's not your fault that you found out he was abusive after you guys already talked about marriage. You don't owe your life, relationships or marriage to anyone other than yourself. Your safety will always be more important. Your happiness too. 

Your parents should be supportive of your decision to leave an abusive relationship and should offer you a hug and express concern, if they have the means to let you stay at their place while you get away from this guy that would also be really supportive of them but ik not everyone has the means... bottom line is that you need support through this. If they can't support you or you know they'll react childish maybe wait to tell them until you're safer and away from the guy.

Personally I still believe you should report it to the police and you can tell them you have concerns over your family's safety as well and feel apprehensive about disclosing the information... I believe it would be up to her to press charges but the state will more than likely remove the child from their care, which is important. He could have continued stomping her or just generally beating her until she died, or it could happen in the future, and the child could have been motherless regardless. It's extremely damaging for a child to be in that situation and it would not surprise me if it suffered the same abuse from him. He could honestly go back to prison and probably should. But consider at minimum sending over a welfare check or the police especially if you hear the arguing again (I think it is more of a risk for you to enter their home and personally involve yourself rather than letting the authorities handle it).

At the very least it will call attention to the issue and you can say you were feeling threatened and scared. Even if nothing happened, the record is there, and then the next time he is screaming uncontrollably you can call again, and the record will build up. The cops SHOULD BE INVOLVED!!! I've been in situations where I didnt call and should have. I have been in situations where I probably didnt NEED to call but did anyway and I never had any regrets when I did call. I regret not calling 100000% more. It completely de-escalates things, maybe if I never called it would have gotten a lot worse.

Also if it's to the point where you feel like you have to start hitting him he is doing WAY TOO MUCH. I have been screamed and screamed at before by my drunk bf until I got physical with him. It made me feel like shit despite in some way knowing I was responding to the abuse at hand, made me feel like I couldnt call the cops when he was being physical with me then too. He shouldn't be around you guys if he's going to get drunk and act like that. It is wrong, it is abusive. And I don't blame you for responding with slapping while in the face of danger and adrenaline pumping thru ur body, in fight or flight mode. Your brain told you fight would be the best way to go. But please take care of yourself, being in those types of situations is horrible and not something to regularly subject yourself to. And it's not your job to protect your mom (should be the other way around, she is the parent u are the child even if you are over the age of 18) but your best bet is by the police doing their job rather than you physically inserting yourself into a fight.

I did have to tell my parents this when they were too harsh to me, because something like leaving a blanket on the couch seems a lot worse if you're someone who regularly listens well and picks up after themselves vs a child who regularly leaves messes and the blanket is not a big deal compared to the mess they have in their room. Parents will lose perspective and get caught up in their own emotions and problems, it's not right but it happens, and losing a spouse is a major problem that forces you to get caught up in a horrible life circumstance. But it's not an excuse for her mistreatment of you-it seems to just be a trigger or source of pain for her. Tell her you see that things are not healthy, emotionally, and that it's becoming hard to manage on your own. She might not know what to do but make therapy a point if she doesnt bring it up. This is all just my random advice but my biggest piece is to maybe talk with a school counselor and see if they can help you with a plan on how to talk to your mom about this or just help you out with problems in general"

Neglect is ignored so much because people don't view it as abuse despite it being often EQUALLY as destructive. Either abusive or oblivious on the parents end and I also believe it's part of a parents job to educate themselves on how to properly care for the emotionality of their child. I understand not everything is black and white. I suspect that not all parents who work very long, hard hours emotionally neglect their children."
abuse,fitf8au,t3_f9pf3k,1582717962.0,That was definitely abuse. I'm sorry.
abuse,fite2nc,t1_fit383q,1582716687.0,Yeah this article said emotional neglect is not necessarily abuse and I'm saying that seems wrong.
CPTSD,fighjma,t1_figh57j,1582399542.0,💙 thank you

dpdr,fifw0p8,t3_f7ta3g,1582393797.0,"CBD is an anti psychotic and the effects to me are subtle but noticeable. It just kind of makes feeling grounded a little easier and more gentle, things feel a little clearer and calmer, though I can still be having really bad anxiety. I think the act of inhaling, holding breath, then exhaling while vaping is also calming"
abuse,fifvhqe,t3_f7vgb5,1582393631.0,It must have taken immense strength to do the coming out and reporting. I hope everything turns out well for you and his other children and you did a truly brave and difficult thing.
CPTSD,fifbznx,t3_f7outa,1582388242.0,"Wow yeah that makes sense. My inner teen wants some fun and freedom, dancing at concerts and playing guitar loudly in my room and singing loudly. Inner child wants lullabies and baking foods and fantasy movies."
CPTSD,fi22gua,t3_f5y5k0,1582069957.0,"That has to be tough. I'm sorry. I would hate to look like my abuser because even seeing someone that looks like my abuser in the streets is very jarring and uncomfortable. In those situation I will search their face, posture, body language, voice, clothing style, etc to differentiate them from my abuser. And it kinda works with most people, takes the intensity away a bit... maybe a dumb suggestion but, maybe try examining your face and features for the things that don't look like her? Your smile, shape of the bridge of your nose, chin shape or exact eye color? Braid or twist your hair, wear colors she didn't often wear, maybe do your make up (if u wear it) in a way that she didn't but that you still like. Maybe dyeing your hair or adding highlights or something like that. Idk if that's a suggestion that is good or if it's better to relate your natural self to only your natrual self, rather than trying to change your natural self. Maybe grounding yourself into your body, closing your eyes and understanding you're operating a different body than hers despite the visuals and your laugh, which are still uniquely your own. Best wishes"
CPTSD,fi21l3j,t3_f5ztam,1582069390.0,"To me having confidence will trigger something of shame. Like having confidence itself... like I had no right to act that way, or feel that way, and I made a fool of myself for engaging. Idk if you can relate. I know combing over social interactions later usually serves me no good and it's better to not reflect too much but ik it's like sometimes compulsory to rethink of things. I remember my family mocking me if I displayed confidence and friendly joy so then I'd isolate. Sometimes I think I was over-exuberant but whatever- I'd rather be a bubbly person than the negative, cold and scared person I am now."
CPTSD,fi20qy9,t3_f5xgfx,1582068860.0,"I feel almost hatred towards enablers. Trying to come to terms with like all the members of my family being enablers too, I just want nothing to do with them anymore.

I'm sorry that happened to you. The signs were all there and yet you were failed by all the adults around you, who had more power and decision than any child. They should have done so much better."
dpdr,fi13l0y,t1_fi137vg,1582049919.0,That makes way more sense.
dpdr,fi13i8c,t3_f5s7qe,1582049874.0,"It still feels like dissociation imo but I haven't tried heroine. People also micro dose with shrooms, probably better to try that than heroine... Ketamine clinics can help with PTSD too and you might benefit from that if you have that diagnosis (or a few others like even clinical depression I think can be listed for going to the clinic). I wouldnt trust 1 case of maybe manageable self medicating vs the countless horror stories from countless individuals"
dpdr,fi0y511,t3_f5t6dz,1582047038.0,"Your brain processing your daily life, probably. Maybe whatever you were disassociating about in the dream is something you have to be really gentle with yourself with in waking life? Like a topic that you would have to ease into and slowly heal from, maybe your dreams pointing that out to you"
abuse,fi0wj7t,t3_f5qjbf,1582046209.0,"Just another person chiming in to validate that yes this is abuse. The people you may have asked maybe also grew up with similar situations and the whole 'my mom beat me with a spoon' is joked about and belittled to be something much less than abuse. It's just ""parenting"". Sure maybe, in previous decades, but we know now that this is not correct and is abusive. Yelling to the point of making someone cry is abusive, especially just repeated yelling even if you're not crying. She likely experienced similar things growing up and doesn't have a logical excuse- of course it's not to make your smarter-she is just passing down generational trauma. It's not an excuse, it's bullcrap, but sometimes mentally understanding why people do what they do has helped me heal and disconnect myself from them."
dpdr,fhyp9gh,t1_fhy4ps8,1581980723.0,"2 weeks was how long it would fully take to go away for me, gradually getting less and less noticeable as the days go on. it's day 3-you don't feel AS INTENSE as day 1, right? it will continue to decrease but I know it's uncomfortable and scary and you shouldn't have to wait around to feel normal again. 

try to ground yourself in the meantime. focus on things that stimulate the 5 senses, and tbh, meditation pulled me out of months-long dissociation so i always encourage people to look up a guided meditation and do those for multiple days in a row at least once a day. just a suggestion but u got nothing to lose. i hope u feel better soon take care"
