Anxiety,ev8d8g1,t3_ciojvp,1564276117.0,"I deal with tension and migraine headaches. Advil liquid gels work faster for me than ibuprofen tablets. I  take about 2 of the 400 mgs( can range to 1000mg) but thats approved by my doctor, only take what the bottle says is safe.

Also if you smoke, stop. If you drink, avoid.

Hope this helps."
Anxiety,ev8cw5x,t3_cip0pc,1564275830.0,"Hey man,
You’re still in uni, which is great. It means you still have a lot of time to make use of on campus facilities. If you go to your schools department, they give career advice and coaching for free. Also have you applied for your on campus jobs? If you’re in CS, you can apply to be a web developer etc, they usually have a big database of available jobs that you can sign up for, and then apply to them. Also try applying to internships and co-ops. People are really nice with hiring interns. If you have any projects you can add to your resume, do that. 

Hope this helps"

This shit happens all the time. I always take my trash out, some people do, but it looks like this at the end of the day because people are not one thing or another due to nationality."
Anxiety,eu5iap5,t3_ceu91n,1563478162.0,In Canada everyone says sorry for no reason and so you don’t feel weird if you’re saying it out of anxiety.

mentalillness,et02bph,t1_eszuj8v,1562371627.0,"So the doctors considered both bipolar and borderline and couldn’t completely decide. During or right before her period, she completely loses control of herself, this is the time where she spends a lot of her money or random things and writes hate messages to everyone in our extended family and friends.

She sleeps weird hours when she’s preoccupied by photoshopping photos of herself with my cousin and emailing it to him. She writes at least 14 emails to him. No response was ever given. We just facilitated a phone call where he clearly told her that she has a misunderstanding and that he is not interested in her."
mentalillness,eszfq9c,t1_esz5ynu,1562361131.0,"No. Definitely not exaggerating. The people shes been stalking have thought about getting a restraining order but don’t because they’re family.  She was a normal popular girl in high school, got good grades. But still found stuff like math hard. Works as a dental hygienist now. She has harassed multiple people. Fights every single day. Idk what to tell you. Maybe it is autism, none of the doctors have mentioned that though."
