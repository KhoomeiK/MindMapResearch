supportlol,fmagkyf,t3_ftudr2,1585893437.0,"Honestly, supports dictate the lane. If you’re dying 2v2 then it’s probably your fault. A bad engage, lack of presence, not controlling brush vision etc. I know it sounds bad but adcs need to focus on cs-ing as a main priority.

Now obviously you can get bad adcs that don’t know how to position, waste spells on cs, don’t follow up your engages, etc. with these kinds of adcs you want to play safe. They might be bad at laning but once the structured team fights break out, often they show a different side. They’re at the same rank as you for a reason, don’t discredit them based on a bad early game / hard 2v2 matchup.

In saying that, yes, rush mobi boots and abandon your adc. Spam ping him to hug turret and look for those mid roams or invades with your jungler. It’s a lot easier to win these fights and a lot more comes out of them (eg objectives) due to the surprise factor. The enemy team aren’t used to supports leaving lane before a bot lane tower goes down. It’s a great way to boost your teams morale and tilt the enemy. Just make sure your adc has the mental to take it. 

As a side note, I often find that the enemy love to tower dive an adc when he’s alone, which often result in a 1 for 1. Which sounds even better if you consider that while this is happening, you’re roaming around the map securing objectives and getting your mid jg and top ahead."

Guardian is fine. I prefer aftershock but I’ve had plenty of success with both. 

You definitely want to switch out demolish for shield bash.

If you’re playing a poke heavy lane you want second wind. If you’re in a matchup that gives you good all in opportunities, go for bone plating. Otherwise conditioning if you don’t plan on fighting till mid game.

Revitalise is fine but obviously go unflinching in heavy cc lanes.

Now the secondary tree. 

Imo, scorch celerity is troll. You don’t need the added ms, you have enough on your ult and with mobi boots. (Don’t pick any other boot, ever. Maybe if they’re all ad or ap go tabis/mercs, but even then...) Scorch damage is irrelevant if you can’t all in early as it doesn’t scale great. Good opponents won’t give you that opportunity.

Better secondary trees are 

Triumph, legend tenacity. 

Or

Magical footwear, futures market. Roaming with mobis around lvl6 is your power spike. Can’t stress this enough. You wanna be getting to those midlane skirmishes and be back to lane before your adc realises you’re gone.

Also, spell thiefs can be troll. If you’re versing a Leona you really don’t want to be trading up in her face. Consider relic shield in some match ups.

Items are perfect. Sometimes I rush mikaels if I’m versing a heavy ap poke support like brand/Zyra or champs with heavy cc like morg, malz etc"
