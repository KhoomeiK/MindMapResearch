3.  If this  .js is the step past where I'm stuck, then no. However, i did not follow the instructions past where I am stuck, so I'm unsure about what this file is, where it would be  located or what would be added to it.
4.  See above. Not seen a parameter scripts.userprofile=false yet.
5. See above - don't believe i've been able to create one yet.

I followed these instructions, found with the actual files on github.

I have not created or altered any files, as the instructions lead me to the area in which i'm stuck - the program is crashing at boot. The next portion of the instructions are to run it, get into game and create a character configuration.

&#x200B;

I have a profile .Json file, but it appears to be metrics on how much I've run, etc. The only thing in that file I see that  sounds helpful at all is at the end:

The bot runs, starts diablo in a windowed frame, but seems to do one of two things:

Situation 1: does nothing and stays on the post blizzard graphics (the druid/assn running on  the bridge screen) before giving ""11:19:20 (Drood) D2BS is not responding... starting profile

11:19:24 (Drood) Crash Info: Script: none Area: out of game""

Situation 2: the bot actually seems responsive and clicks onto [battle.net](https://battle.net) before just closing/reopening a window and prompting ""11:19:46 (Drood) Window has unexpectedly exited... starting profile

11:19:49 (Drood) Crash Info: Script: none Area: out of game""

&#x200B;

I changed nothing. The next step is supposed to be to load in with D2botlead and create a char config, but its crashing at the start and nobody can figure out why."

Maybe if for a heavy blue tank build you could spec into armor repair drone and your armor regen stats also applied (in portion at least) to your drone. 

Or maybe for a heavy red AR build your striker drone could absorb some of your crit/crit dmg or something. Not to make it comparable to the drone of a tech build but to make it not useless.
