toastme,fr3u8gt,t3_gmgrie,1589866418.0,"It's okay. I don't think most of us knew what we were doing at age 22... some of us in our 30's are still figuring things out. You have a sweet face, and I am sure whatever you are going through will make you stronger as a person, and someone who can empathise with others who may have gone through similar struggles"

SuicideWatch,fpyim3g,t3_gfsv5a,1589004537.0,"Having trained as a therapist, and also having been on the receiving end... I can agree with your opinion that only you can help yourself. That is truth. 

The thing is, all of us usually want to ""get better"", whatever that means... not even just for mental health, but for careers, skill development, life in general. But we cannot deny that we are social beings and need support of others. Sure, if you have a great support system you can trust, then therapy isn't needed. I have noticed many clients are hesitant to spill all their ""secrets"" to someone who knows them though, hence by a third party can be helpful. 

That said, for some people, therapy can be a waste of time and money. Best to only try a few sessions and objectively self-evaluate after: is it making your life better? If not, then it may not be for you"

Wellington,fpb52g5,t3_gcf8rp,1588462272.0,"First of all, props to you for posting this. I'm 30/f and have found it challenging to make friends in Wellington outside of work. I came here last year not knowing one person, and as a single person it takes courage to go out and talk to random people. Been here a year now and still don't know too many people.. Just moved to Newtown so am going to need to start meeting people and trying groups after the lockdown finishes. I am always keen to make new friends, so could definitely meet up with you and your partner for a boardgame sometime, or try one of the board game groups people have been talking about. I'm pretty open to new hobbies and am tired of just looking at my screen so much!"

SuicideWatch,fo2gzml,t3_g5ar9e,1587462073.0,"This is so tragic to hear. I am so sorry for your loss. I know words will likely provide little relief, but know that people are here to support you and help you through the grieving process. You can DM me anytime. As someone who ashamedly tried to take my own life a few weeks ago, I can say that in those moments, it is impossible to think straight.  Pain can do strange things to the brain, and emotional pain at huge levels can  put our body into a fight or flight mode where anything to make the pain stops seems reasonable. I pray she is out of pain now and may her soul rest in peace. I'm so sorry you have to be the one left behind to process such a tragedy"

Wellington,fjasz3c,t3_fca6nf,1583180012.0,"When I first moved to Wellington last year I met a guy who seemed really friendly and he asked to meet for coffee on a Saturday morning. We had got on well at the first time we met so I was keen to expand my friend network and meet him. He showed up at the cafe with his girlfriend and dressed in a suit at 9am on a Saturday.  They both then spent 30mins trying to sell Amway to me (it is called Team Mak or something down here) and going on about how good mentoring is. They said that it is difficult to be selected to be mentored and I needed to go through a vetting process first. I text him later that day to say I wasnt interested. 

A couple of months later, a friend of mine went to a 20s/30s meetup and the same thing happened to him. Only this time my friend fell for it and spent money on books and time with his mentor. He became obsessed with ""growing his business"" and when I told him it was Amway he became super defensive. It was sad to watch. 

I think Team Mak preys on vulnerable and naive people and something needs to be done about it/more awareness needs to made"
