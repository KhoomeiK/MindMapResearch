Consider a [plastic surgery-free nose job.](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/q39tRhAoKRI/maxresdefault.jpg) **Edit:** [**Some info on it.**](https://www.realself.com/question/sudbury-interested-5-minute-nose-job)

Look into simple makeup, like glossier, with light blush and eyebrow care. Don't wear black mascara or eyeliner, since it will wash out the rest of your face. Try browns and dark browns. For example, look at [this.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Vindicta/comments/fxt8ao/the_power_of_makeup_skills/) When you have naturally lighter skin and hair, black will wash you out and look harsh. Look how good she looks with the more natural, brown makeup.

Since you have naturally pink lips, no colour is really needed. Maybe look into a gloss?

I'd try playing with different hair parts. The far part is really outdated, and not only that, but giving into a callick and parting your hair there for many years can lead to hair loss on the parted section. It's important to rotate where you part your hair.

You have clear skin, so don't start wearing foundation. You have nothing to cover up. Focus on accentuating your eyebrows with the natural color, and your eyelashes with a brown maskara.

Again, you look fantastic, especially in the bottom left photo. Just work with what is naturally there, and really focus on making your value about who you are as a person, not what you look like, because you'll never be happy with yourself. Think about the gorgeous models who are insecure. They have everything and still aren't happy with how they look. Imagine how you'll look in 40 years. Will you submit yourself to hating how you look because you've gotten older? Fall in love with yourself. You deserve it."

It's really important to rotate your hair part because if you don't, it leads to hair loss on the part you've had, which looks like you have had it for awhile? Use a blowdryer to get your hair used to a new part, drying just the roots, directionally. The part you have right now is slightly outdated. Very late 2000's and early 2010's. Otherwise, makeup and hair is on point. If it's possible based on your natural eyebrows, don't tweeze/style them so thin. *Slightly* thicker eyebrows will make your nose look smaller, and honestly, your nose is pretty damn fine. I'd look into a non-surgical nose job, look those up because they do wonders and they are semi-permanent. (No botched fears here.)"
TheGlowUp,fomap19,t3_g87fcc,1587883447.0,"It really just depends what look you're going for, feminine or not.Your hair looks nice and thick, but I can't tell if it's the way that it's styled or what, but the cut just looks bad. I feel like you'd look nice with any length of hair, but I don't think the current cut or how it's parted is working for you, it looks kinda choppy or uneven.  


Tweeze stray eyebrow hairs, and if simple or unnoticeable makeup is something you're interested in, I'd suggest either Benefit Cosmetic's ka-BROW or their Gimme Brow+. The gimme brow will comb through the hairs and set them and you won't feel it, as well as fill in some gaps. Mine's lasted me a long time, too.  


Fashion sense wise, simple styles are always really great. If that's you, though. Don't be afraid to experiment with colours or styles you like.   


You look really great on your own, but I think the glow up needed might be from you either sharpening up the style you already currently have, or reaching out of your comfort zone into looks you'd like to try. Confidence is key."
