1. Sulfate free shampoo. So that it wont “dry-out” your wavy hair. Only shampoo if you think your hair needs it.
2. Conditioner. You should do this everyday to give it a shine.
3. Short on sides. Trim those hairs and leave out the top part.
4. Crunch it. After washing your hair, just pat or crunch it with towel and let it air dry.
5. Hair cream. It helps to achieve that defined waves and gives out healthy looking hair."

We were watching a talk show that had some kinda spicy and naughty topic and had my driver (30-ish m) bit turned on. He teased me by adjusting his shorts. He tried to show his legs and like flexing it and glancing at me. We were like trying to feel each other and keep doing it for almost 5 mins, by that time he was, i guess horny, and of course, i was also turned on. I saw his left hand glided through his crotch, thighs, until his chest. I admit he was 8/10. Tall and slim fit guy with oozing muscles. He slowed his car down and still glancing at me. So i was like, hol up... I’m not ready for this haha.

Out of nowhere, a motorcycle was rapidly approaching on my right side. Supposedly a one-way-lane, and they were driving in wrong direction. So my driver quickly steered the wheel and stopped and was hit on the front right side (idk much about cars but the one with the lights, near the right wheel, was damaged). I only saw people flipping over and a crashed motorcycle . It happened so fast i was so numb to move.

So basically, if he hasn’t been naughty on me, i could have die."
