GERD,fq5l2ip,t1_fq4bsmd,1589109461.0,"At the moment, a therapist isn‚Äôt necessary. Panic attacks happen when you feel like something is very wrong so you panic and then your body responds accordingly (it obviously panics too) this is usually approachable with finding out what physical symptoms trigger a panic attack in you (for you its acid reflux) most GERD symptoms and stomach problems mimic a heart attack and so does a panic attack. Bottom line is, youre safe. Don‚Äôt worry, you are not in danger. Your body is only doing this to get your attention so you can look after it better! Tomorrow tell your doctor every detail possible, research now about it online so you can prepare to answer for any possible questions. Cheers!"

dating_advice,fpnmt5x,t3_geex4q,1588767681.0,"I can see that a lot of people have had a similar experience (i did too) and its because of the nature of the app Tinder, not you as an individual or the person ghosting. The way Tinder works makes it predetermined to us that a) this app is disposable b) there‚Äôs too many options out there, why should i settle? This is called the paradox of choice. Hence you become disposable too. C) the illusion Tinder creates that a number of people out there ‚Äúlike you‚Äù *just* by seeing your picture plays with your mind, after you talk and create a ‚Äúbond‚Äù and get along really well, have a drink and walk together, with your first tinder match and second and third etc etc - you are being disposable because thats how you two met. Had you met in real life through a mutual friend or at work or or or, you wouldn‚Äôt be AS disposable- yes you can get ghosted too but the chances are much less because of the social constructs and you‚Äôre more likely to get an apology and an explanation. 

Bottom line- its not you or them, it‚Äôs Tinder."

Ive been dealing with anxiety for 10 years, i took medication and it help for a very small while (placebo effect). My advice to you is talk- talk about your anxiety and your feelings to anyone who would listen- a pet, a stranger, a bot, anything- talk so much about it to the point where you get sick and bored of it (its actually just desensitization) you might not be able to live without anxiety, but you‚Äôll be able to live with it. Everyone has anxiety in them- we just have it in larger quantities. Im here to listen, cry when you feel like it- dont hold back your tears for a better time or because you ‚Äúshould be strong now‚Äù. Grief and anger and every emotion should be processed there and then in order not to bite you back. Live the moment as it is, good or bad- whats the worst that can happen? Best!"
Anxiety,fpio69q,t3_gdfeum,1588645027.0,"Absolutely. Its a vicious cycle.
If you feel stuffy you‚Äôll get anxious and your body will go down the drain of a panic attack. Sweating, dizziness, cold sweat, everything. If you find a weird mole on your body you‚Äôll overthink it and go through the whole 9 yard. Its hell honestly im sick of myself"
