writers,fqm20ab,t1_fqlzy8c,1589470129.0,"i appreciate the thoughtfulness of your response, but i think you might have misunderstood my points! i’ll try to clarify. 

i never said “don’t rhyme.” what i said was that forcing yourself into a rhyme scheme might make it more difficult to get your emotions out on paper. rhyme works for some poems, and doesn’t for others. a writer can do what they want when it comes to that, absolutely! but sometimes it makes it more difficult and forces the writer to add filler for the sake of adhering to the rhyme. 

my point in 3 and 4 is more about writing for your own sake, and not trying to please others. writing for others is a surefire way to lose your voice - when asking for feedback, you need to be confident enough in your work in order to incorporate it in a way that YOU like, too. you need to make sure your poem remains YOURS following feedback. i think we are saying the same thing here - as in, investigating why someone doesn’t like a poem and determining for yourself what that means for your poem. this is a skill that often (not necessarily always, but often) has to be learned over time. 

also, i don’t think it’s fair that a lot of commenters simply write “it’s good!” or “it’s bad!” without providing meaningful critique. a poet can’t get better that way. however, that is more a reflection on the commenters and not the writer. 

i hope that clears up my perspective. if you still disagree, that’s fine - everyone writes in their own way. these are things that i have noticed"
writers,fqllj61,t3_gjhe40,1589461087.0,"here are some tips, from a seasoned poet:

1. you don’t need to rhyme to have good poetry. in fact, it’s more important to get what you want to say on paper instead of fussing over the rhyme scheme. 

2. read, read, read. read a lot of poetry of all different kinds. you will learn so much. 

3. your first poems will not be good. most of your poems will not be good. i have written hundreds of poems - maybe more - and about 1% of them are actually good enough for publication. this is ok. poetry is about self-expression, not another person’s eye. 

4. speaking towards that last line above, you need to practice before asking for feedback. this may sound harsh, but if you are serious about poetry, focus on getting the words out and expressing yourself and honing your craft and building your confidence. do not focus on what other people might think of your poetry. as i said, your first few poems will not be good, and the more you share your poetry the more you will hear that, and it may dissuade you from continuing. 

as for this particular poem, try freewriting. you might find it’ll help you break away from the rhyme scene as well as help get your thoughts down."

usually i’ll pick one thing that’s stressing me out the most and make a small amount of progress in it. trash all over the floor? pick up a wrapper and throw it away. dirty laundry everywhere? put some of it in a laundry basket. can’t consistently find a phone charger / wallet / other important items? pile them in an obvious place close to the bed. 

from there, if i have the energy, i might start a load of laundry or pick up more trash - but i’ve found that even making small progress on the things that are most bothering me is a game changer. once i had an old beer in my room and it smelled the whole place up for a month. it took me 10 mins of energy to dump it out, and i instantly felt a small bit better. 

i’m still in the process of recovering from a severe, 18+ month depressive episode, which also includes doing a RIDICULOUS amount of cleaning. i used to want to do it all in a day, so i would get so much cleaning done in like a saturday, but then i would be too burnt out for like a month to work on it again, so then it got messier than it was to begin with. you HAVE to do it slowly, so start with the small, easy stuff that will have the most impact. identify what’s bothering you the most, and then identify some small amount of progress you can make on it, and then rest."

boundaries are super super important, though - have you tried asking before venting? like, “i had a really bad day, can i talk to you about it?” 

my partner and i preface these things with “this is low / moderate / high serious; is that ok right now?” if the response is yes, we continue, and sometimes ask more questions like, “this next bit is about [insert possibly triggering thing], can i continue?” if the response is no, then we turn to our own coping mechanisms. 

even outside of venting, we’ll ask. we work together, so when we get home and want to talk about our day, we’ll ask, “is work talk alright?” just to make sure.

BPDmemes,fh8ro1a,t1_fh8q5hd,1581365974.0,"yes! exactly!

if no one helps me i’m like “i hate you, why won’t you help me?”

and if someone helps me i’m either like “oh god i’m awful and manipulative and a burden” or “fuck you, this is some kind of ego boost and you’re taking advantage of me”"

BPDmemes,fh7o2hl,t3_f1oy49,1581339688.0,"this is the stuff i feel people get tired of. like at least when you’re hurting yourself people have a clear way to help, with a clear outcome - they stop you from hurting yourself, they win, they’re a hero, they’ve saved you. 

but when you’re lying in bed and can’t move, or eat, or sleep, or reach out - there’s no clear answer for them. there is no way to save the day. it’s boring, and they don’t know if they’ve won by the end of it. 

it’s so monotonous to be like this. i wish there was something someone else could do to fix it, but there isn’t, and it’s frustrating to them."
