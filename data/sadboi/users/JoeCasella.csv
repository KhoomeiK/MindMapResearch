New art can rarely communicate in a brazen, unique way. Society will not understand the art, and it will be rejected, which is okay, unless you're financially connected to the art. 

But then financial depence is a problem. 

Financial ""artistic"" dependence creates an ""artist"" who caters and adapts to the status quo. The artist loses her soul and exists solely to produce work to live. 

Hey, we gotta eat, so I ain't lifting my nose and blaming anyone.

However, for art to effectively communicate, the artist must understand the language of his core audience and the degree to which he can push the dialogue. 

Push the language too far, it's gobbledygook 

Don't push the language far enough, it's trite, boring, rehash garbage.

Lose. Lose.

Ultimately, it's a fine line. The artist must understand her audience's language and exploit the language to her artistic end."
