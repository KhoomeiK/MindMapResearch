islamabad,fh7ein9,t3_f1iy1h,1581327672.0,"All of this is true sadly, and these are only superficial issues, the deeper issues are soul wrecking. I have worked as physician for a year in government setup, so encountered mostly poor people. I was horrified by the number of child sex abuse,  stds, domestic violence cases i have seen. I couldnt sleep at night often considering how helpless these people were. 

So good things that i know about culture and pakistan are:
1) cost of health care service, especially in government setups, they do almost free major surgeries, we used to see atleast 200 people from 8am-2pm on opds. Charge was 1 rupee per consultation for a patient. Yes health care is not the best, doctors behaviours not so great but atleast people were getting some treatment. 
2)  some of pakistani young people, litrally they are super few people, who have high ambitions and are working to make pakistan better. They are very few but i am still hopeful because of those people.
3) drug addiction is very low among women, thats because of cultural reasons but still a good thing. 
4) family structure is strong, to the point that its toxic most of the times, but still i like this thing about pakistan that parents dont abandon kids, especially fathers. I agree that its strong to the point of being super toxic, but still alot of better families too.
5) not much pay gap between genders, we had a women president. 
6) also we have great music and litrature. 
7) most of the people are hospitable, specially when you go to nothern areas. Hunza has low crime rate and very high education rate. 

I have lived in pakistan for 7 years and it was hard for me to make this list. Sadly."
