atheism,fqvpvzy,t1_fqvosck,1589682518.0,"I am following a line of thinking that says that everyone has (or needs) a search for purpose. It's a theory, and since it's so subjective, I am not saying that I know anything. The principal objective of the project is to search how atheists search for a purpose, IF they search for a purpose in the first place. 

Spirituality isn't directly connected to religion, that's the main line I am following. But it sure can be connected to it and atheists don't have any spirituality whatsoever. It's a theory,

Let me try to clarify better what you asked: the pychological core would be that one responsible for your feelings while the spiritual core would be the one responsible for your search for self-transcendency, to what would make you truly happy and satisfied."

Following the logotherapical thesis, spirituality would be the third core of the human being, together with the biological and the psychological. It basically is our search for purpose (or purposes)."

Of course that his opinion is important on the matter, but you are the one in your body. Even if he has been with you through everything and he sure suffered as well, it‚Äôs your body who physically took all the pain. I think that he should be the one to try to change his way of thinking because as I see, he is not taking your feelings very much into consideration. 4 pregnancies are a lot for someone‚Äôs body to take, and you already have too many pressure raising your 2 kids and the other one is already just behind the corner. Saying that, I think that you should prioritize yourself and follow your own decision. You have to take care of yourself before you can take care of your family."
