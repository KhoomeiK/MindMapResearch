sweatystartup,fquw3hp,t3_gl1egh,1589665435.0,"I got my first Honda for $200 by incessantly searching marketplace, gumtree (craigslist) and eBay. It paid for itself in days. If you’re using a push mower and have a small budget your efficiency will be improved just by getting a gas mower though. You aren’t stuck with it. 

It’s also worth checking out junk shops and pawn brokers. I’ve found Briggs and Stratton engines are a bit gutless and don’t stand up to commercial work. the Honda knockoff engines are a lot better (some of the old victas have them) but just get what you can afford then upgrade as you go. I started with a half broken rover, an electric trimmer and a broom in the back of a Kia Rio and just upgraded equipment as I went."
