I don't know if this will be helpful or not, and it it's over the line please consider it as a gesture of goodwill instead:

If you can type, you can code. If you can code, you can do lots! If you're into making a good user experience / things look fabulous, you can design front end of interfaces. But I also enjoy the back end work of moving data around. It's at least a feasible way to work from home. The combination of creative and analytical skills appeals to me.

If you're curious, I could point you to the resources I leaned on when I began my transition to being a software developer last year."

I think it would suck if that was your fate. I am not a therapist (have you seen one you click with? I highly recommend it for everyone), but my ""big"" ex left me because of my declining mental health ... and I'm pretty sure it's affected every relationship since. I'm still untangling it, but that's okay, because we can fucking change godsdamnit (swears are directed at myself, not you). It is not our fate to remain the same for eternity - time and neuroplasticity will not allow it. Especially when enhanced by the right meds (which can be a loooooooong but ultimately helpful road).
