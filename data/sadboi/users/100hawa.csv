MeetPeople,fms9c7x,t1_fms7llu,1586350265.0,No that fine. I feel like when people make it about gender it does nothing for equality because you have made everything the character does about their sex not about them. What are you watching now? I just started with Tiger king
MeetPeople,fms6e87,t1_fms5vvx,1586347969.0,Yeah I binge watched it on bbc iplayer one month ago. It's good like I was thinking it would be bad because of everything that was said but I really liked it. And it was not to over the top with women power that can sometimes be uncomfortable to watch even as a women myself. You know like that scene in endgame it made me cringe in the cinema. What did you think of it?
MeetPeople,fms5jot,t3_fx481r,1586347241.0,Oh I think my will always be season 6. But I just love the show it kind of gives me a weird adult Peter Pan vibe. And I think Matt Smith played that well.

mentalhealth,fljcvtp,t3_fovy8a,1585207198.0,Don't let people tell you how to feel and what is real. I have been depressed since I was 9 years old and It took me 10 years to get help. Because my GP did not  believe I could be depressed at 9 years old. Am now 24 years old and am becoming a clinic psychologist to help people like me in the future.

BPD,fbiyrxa,t3_edidey,1576919711.0,The dreams feel so vivid they almost feel as if I have not fallen asleep but just started a new day. It the feeling of not knowing if what has happened is real or if it was all a dream.  Sometimes when it's really hard have to keep asking my family if what happened was real or not. It like one of the worse things for me it makes me question my own sanity.
