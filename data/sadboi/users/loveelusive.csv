NoStupidQuestions,fqnm2zf,t3_gjqcou,1589497300.0,I only feel cringey when I do it around other people. That only happens when iâ€™m drunk though haha

TooHotToHandle,fpa2vmu,t3_g56an2,1588439703.0,lmao this is perfect
relationship_advice,fop709a,t1_fop60l0,1587954491.0,I will. We had a long talk to about it and it was basically him saying that I need to let it go and that he hates how girls are always so concerned with other females that their significant other had an association with before them. ðŸ™„
relationship_advice,fop5rm5,t1_fop2wv1,1587953692.0,"Thank you so much. I just donâ€™t know how get him to understand that Iâ€™m being haunted so much by it and that itâ€™s driving me crazy. He has told me to confront the people that bring her up and make them stop but I honestly feel like thatâ€™s not my place to do. I feel like thatâ€™s his responsibility since these are his friends and family, you know? His response is always to just not listen to it which is a lot harder now that I know he lied about something to me involving her. 

Your question does put into perspective what I need to truly decide on. I donâ€™t want to be second place in my own relationship."
relationship_advice,fop5910,t1_fop4bkq,1587953365.0,I know I need to be more confident. Half the fights around this girl have to do with me being insecure and iâ€™m working on that part. This one would have been so much easier if he was just honest about it from the beginning and gave me the chance to decide if I want to deal with the baggage before i caught feelings. I never thought he would lie to me so thatâ€™s why this situation is hitting me different.
