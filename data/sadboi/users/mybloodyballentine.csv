Most people trap at night since cats are nocturnal. They set up the trap with enticing food inside, and if the cat is trapped, they can stay in the trap for a day or two until you can get them to the vet. Sometimes you get a raccoon or a possum instead and then you have to try again. The vet will give them a rabies vaccine and flea medication and probably dewormer.

Right now you're at the ""I don't want to live but don't have a plan"" stage, which feels bad, I know, but it's not as bad as having a plan to go through with it.

The official death toll in the city rose to 3,202 on Tuesday morning, with the number of confirmed Covid-19 cases at 72,324.

But de Blasio acknowledged the true toll is far higher.

As WNYC first reported, people who die at home without being tested for coronavirus are not being tallied in the official count — and 200 people are dying in their homes each day, compared with 20 to 25 during normal times.

“I am assuming the vast majority of those deaths are coronavirus-related,” de Blasio said. “We do want to know the truth about what happened in every death at home, but I think we can say at this point it’s right to assume the vast majority are coronavirus-related, and that makes it even more sobering — the sense of how many people we’re losing. “"

Right now they might be limited, but in the future I bet you’d be great at volunteering with at risk youth. It can be as simple as showing up with drawing materials and having a sketching hour, or a book club, or a music club. 

When I was feeling my worst, I started cleaning cages at a cat shelter. It was a low key fun thing to look forward to each week."
