I find the pomodoro method to work for me. Set a timer for 25 minutes and start to work. After 25 minutes take a 5 minute break, then back for another 25 minutes. Many times I will keep going after the timer goes off because I have gotten into “the groove.”

Getting some work done on a project also relieves that anxiety. When you have a project looming, there is always a little part of your brain worrying about it. Getting work done on the project helps to shut down the anxiety."

I was not ready to be on meds, and being home made things much better. When I left home and went back to the country where I live, the panic returned, as did the self medication. I went back a month later and told my physician the whole story. He put me on meds that have really helped, and give me some for acute attacks. 6 weeks later and the meds are helping. I have taken the “emergency” meds only 3 times. 

Go see the doctor, be honest with what is going on with you. They are bound by confidentiality, what you say to them will never be repeated to anyone. If you don’t feel comfortable with that doctor, try again with a different one. Keep at it. There are people who want to help you."

Anxiety,f1grzue,t3_d9f3gd,1569475432.0,"You woke up this morning and that is good.  If you feel you are in a medical emergency, by all means get treated. That being said, you combined a large amount of alcohol with the caffeine in the excedrin. Your body is trying to get itself back to normal. Just recognize that today you will feel like crap. Get through the day and go to bed early. You will feel better tomorrow. I would not recommend drinking today"
Anxiety,exs009x,t3_cu7hn1,1566528456.0,"I sympathize with you. I have been in technical roles and customer facing roles. I much prefer to be the technical person. Do you work with a sales team? Salesmen thrive on the interaction we try to avoid. What helped me was allow the sales team to do most of the talking and I fill in technical details as needed. It helps to do a pre-meeting meeting with the salesman. 

Ask them how this will go. What questions will they ask?  What is the objective of this meeting?  What does success mean from this meeting?

Asking you to field a call while in the hospital is unacceptable. Is there someone else in your role that you could shadow?  Seeing how others do it can be helpful."

Anxiety,evy1ab7,t3_clpps9,1564918337.0,"My first time posting in this forum. I have been dealing with severe anxiety for the past 10 days. I am down over 20 pounds (probably ok as I have plenty of weight to spare).  The pizza in my fridge has lasted 3 days and half of it is still in there. I find fruit tastes good. I had several slices of watermelon for supper tonight. I was good and it seemed to settle my stomach. I like it with salt (even if my Dr. says it’s not good for my blood pressure, but I guess the anxiety isn’t good for it either)"
