exmormon,f7zav1i,t3_dy71h7,1574107986.0,"Saying homosexuality is a choice. Like it’s this incredibly tempting thing that all men and women can give into. Asking the question, why would someone choose that (considering the abuse a gay person gets vs a straight one for the sake of argument)? To my fellow TBMs would always get a mixed response. Anything from, because they got addicted to gay porn to because it’s more tempting to some than others. 

Saying everyone is straight but sexual temptation is a roll of the dice in terms of sexuality was really confusing. And, if they (gay people) love and marry then how’s that breaking a rule if they are faithful to each other? Does god care if a man puts his dick in a man’s mouth or butt vs a woman’s? Does that mean no BJs or anal because mouths and butt holes aren’t vaginas? What about hand jobs? Is masturbation gay?

You can see how flimsy the argument of the “problem” is.

Having gay friends and relatives really broke the church for me because I knew better. Gay people aren’t any different in terms of temptations or desires they are just more into their own sex. Also, gender is a construct so if a straight man is also turned on by trans women, is he gay? Does it matter?

They’ve (the LDS apologists) walked it back but it depends on who you ask. Some admit homosexuality is natural and the natural man is an enemy to god. Therefore, don’t do it because it’s against nature in the sense that it won’t produce children (unless one of you is trans which means it’s ok)? If it’s natural what is the problem? Heterosexuality is also natural? Why is that part of nature not an enemy to god? It makes no sense.

I hope nobody took offense to this. I have nothing but love for my LGBTQ+ brothers and sisters."
