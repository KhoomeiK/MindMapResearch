Those tools- gaming, reading, movies, are useful but truthfully I'm unable to control my addiction over them. Once I get attached, I'm done for. Those things, I used to enjoy it for pure fun but now, I use them as a way of distraction, I don't like that. I feel immense amount of guilt as well when i use those tools. :( I'm trying to find something better, I guess. For now, reading novel works the best but I end up being on it for the whole day and eventually get a headache. I guess, It'll take a while for me to control.

Haha, I've noticed that most of us are perfectionist. I hope you eventually get your work done soon enough."

I mean, don't you ever look around and sometimes stare at certain person for no reason? But literally like no thoughts. It's just our eyes moving and capturing everything that's there.

They are just looking, nothing probably comes to their mind neither are they thinking bad about you."
