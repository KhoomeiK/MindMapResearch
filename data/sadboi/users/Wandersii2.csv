pilonidalcyst,f80thbi,t3_dydo38,1574137871.0,"I'd take a more proactive approach. Realize that at any moment it could abscess which some people say is the worst pain they've been in before. This condition can create tunnels as well. 

Personally I got the cleft lift done with fewer symptoms than you. But everyone has to decide for themselves what the best option is. 

The cool thing is that I'm just one week post-op and I'm already 85% back to normal in terms of my routine. Some pain remains but it's better than me wondering if I'll get an abscess when I go to Europe in January. 

Also...even a catastrophic insurance plan is better than no insurance. Have you tried enrolling in ACA or Medicaid?"

pilonidalcyst,f7na71v,t3_dwxy1g,1573891771.0,"I understand feeling afraid. It's totally to be expected. There are doctors and nurses out there who can heal you. Just remember that. It isn't your job to heal yourself. It's their job and they have trained for it. Let some of the responsibility go. 

Your responsibility is to inform yourself of the risks with this condition and the possible cures. Then you need to make a decision. You have time to make a decision. Set some deadlines for your research, then make a choice.

You can be more preventative and go for something like the cleft lift, or you can try less invasive options with the knowledge that it may come back and it may make cleft lift or other surgeries harder later.

Personally I hate the unknown so after my first flare up I got the cleft lift with Dr. Immerman this week and feel good about that choice so far. I don't want to live wondering when my cyst will abscess or if sinuses will open up near my asshole (the horror). So I went for the surgery with the highest success rate with and that's without a doubt the cleft lift. The open wound surgery horrified me and when I found out its success rate was low on top of it being a long recovery I counted it out. The closed surgery seemed better but still lower success rate than cleft lift. To me it's a no-brainer, but there's a lot to consider. For example it does change the appearance of your ass crack. Some people care more about that than others. I care about that but I want to protect my health. 

You're going to be ok. I'm a huge huge baby about medical stuff --- I mean I think I surprised seasoned nurses before my surgery with how anxious I was --- and I got through the pain and anxiety. You can do this. Take your time with the information and do diligent research. Then make the best decision you can about your care. You've got this."

pilonidalcyst,f7jzjgu,t1_f7jyoou,1573790524.0,"I'm only on day three of healing. Had surgery on Tuesday. I think I may have a slightly low pain tolerance which is made worse by the fact that I get really anxious about pain/wounds so I'm not a happy camper. However this cleft lift surgery is supposed to be much easier to recover from than the more typical surgeries. 

I'd say you should do the surgery during a week/two week long break and have someone you trust like a parent or long term significant other help you out. So schedule it for first thing in January and you should be good by the time school starts or wait until spring break. I can do most normal stuff but it takes me longer and I don't want to bend down right now because everything feels tight and I don't want to rip anything. So putting on shoes and showering and stuff can be a bit hard and I need some help. 

I also need my wife to help me change gauze and clear my drain. So yeah I wouldn't just do this surgery and try to go to class. Take it easy, give yourself time to rest. Recovery isn't fun but it's doable! I'm a huge baby about this stuff and I can handle it so you can too!"

Days 2-3 have been a bit harder. The pain is there but I also think I am going through a lot emotionally since this is my first significant surgery and my ass will probably look different from now on.

I did EMDR and literally within a few weeks all of these symptoms disappeared. I don't know if it works this well for everyone, but I had done other types of therapy before and they never helped. EMDR saved my sanity.

So they are trying to convince you that even when you act independent, it's actually because you're dependent on your boyfriend. They are trying to steal progress from you by attributing it to him. The healthier and more adult-like you become, the more they'll do this. You're going against the gravity of your family and they don't like it, so they are manipulating you.

My family thinks every boundary I have set up is because of my wife. They try to convince me she's controlling and stuff. But in reality, while she has helped me get healthier, I am making these choices on my own.

Part of leaving dysfunction is the loneliness of not having support where you'd like it to come from (your family). It's a very lonely path, but it's better than playing by the dysfunctional family's rules. Along the way you'll find new family and friends who will support you in the way you need."

Dallas,f283avv,t1_f282x66,1570051755.0,Just curious. Are women's prisons as violent in general and specifically against cops?
AmberGuyger,f2815cd,t3_dcgjdh,1570050391.0,Does anyone thinks this is too lenient? Too harsh? I'd love to hear opinions.
Dallas,f27px4v,t1_f24frf1,1570043619.0,Yeah it's fucked up. I'd be totally unable to function if I had killed someone (by accident).
Dallas,f26zctc,t1_f25h47j,1570027177.0,"You're spot on. I don't think Amber is a monster but she was indoctrinated by a macho ""fuck you"" shoot first ask questions later culture. Not just on the force but it's clear that off duty she made her identity about this (see her Pinterest). 

She was itching to kill. She dehumanized the public evidenced by the texts shown during sentencing where she talks about pepper spraying randomly into an MLK parade. She had no respect for the Bos of the world. Do I believe she understands now? Do I believe she feels bad now? Do I believe all this nightmarish shit she created woke her up? Yes. But it's too late. 

It's a huge waste for Bo and his family. Also for her and hers. Shitty culture creates these shitty situations."
AmberGuyger,f26w7e7,t1_f26s6sq,1570024966.0,Wow dude. Totally tasteless. Her and Jean's lives are over. He was young as fuck. She just put on 15 years of age in one year and is staring down a life sentence possibly. Please have some respect.
AmberGuyger,f25p1r3,t3_daklrl,1569980124.0,This is pretty damning so far.
myfavoritemurder,f25i6xo,t1_f1bh642,1569975167.0,"Yeah I tend to agree. I think she was legitimately confused when she shot him. She thought she was in her house. But I think the macho, hyper-American, aggressive cop/army culture she was surrounded by informed her reaction. She was steeped in that macho hyper bullshit which is obvious from her Pinterest posts. I don't see her as an evil person, rather a person who is ignorant and too absorbed by what I consider a really unfortunate and shitty cultural landscape. Most people, hell even most officers, would run AWAY from perceives danger until calling for help. Why didn't she? Because she's hypervigilant. Because of her culture. Because her identity was wrapped up in being big and bad and taking down ""bad guys"" like a fucking little kid would talk about.

The fact is that a huge role of our legal system is to prevent families from enacting vigilante justice. She took a life and blew a fucking literal hole through a family. He paid for her stupidity and now she is paying too. I don't know if she should be labeled a murderer but she can't get off free. We can't support cultural environments that produce this kind of violence, even if she and her world/family/coworkers I'm certain aren't all bad."
myfavoritemurder,f25h7ca,t1_f1qd4yz,1569974450.0,Isn't it plausible to be mentally fatigued but not physically? Sometimes when I'm really fucked mentally I go on runs. I'm not defending her just wondering what your reply is to that. She really fucked up regardless. And that dude's poor mom. I feel so bad.
politics,f23up7e,t1_f229row,1569938098.0,This is incoherent as fuck.
cringe,f2318r0,t1_f1z12hb,1569902638.0,I'm having serious Reddit deja Vu. Have you written this before somewhere? I swear I've seen this before.
cringe,f231291,t1_f1yyhz5,1569902480.0,Why not just legalise pedophilia as long as both parties are mature enough? It opens a huge door to powerless young people being manipulated and coerced and forced to lie. Our government lacks the resources to evaluate relationships for maturity. The laws exist to protect more vulnerable people like kids. I don't really think incest should be illegal between consenting adults but even that gets dicey if you consider how someone who turned 18 today but has never left home could be hurt by an abuser.
cringe,f230je6,t3_daczw8,1569902023.0,Does anyone else get a Michael Scott vibe from this?
