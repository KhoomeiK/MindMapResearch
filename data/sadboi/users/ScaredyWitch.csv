BPD,fpsuep3,t3_gfd6kv,1588879787.0,"Eventually, you will stop missing them. It will take a long time, but the most effective tactic I use is logic. 

When my brain insists they're perfect, I remind myself that no one is perfect. When my brain tells me how much I hate them, I remind myself that I do, in fact care. 

Even if i dont always feel convinced, it helps. I write down my thoughts and feelings when I'm upset and it helps take the pressure off. 

I had an FP once for over 10 years. I thought I loved her, but I didn't know what love was. I have since let her go. She's married and we usually talk once a year. We're good friends, but I don't miss her like that anymore.

BPD,fpczc0g,t3_gcqyse,1588516426.0,"This is tough. Let me begin by saying that I have BPD too and that though some of my friends suffer from depression and anxiety, our experiences are very different. 

The first thing a lot of BPD publications say first is that a diagnosis of BPD is not a death sentence. This carries heavy implications, namely that life with BPD is incredibly hard sometimes. 

Yes, everyone has problems. Of course. And, furthermore, a lot of people's problems are much worse than mine. I know that. I can only deal with mine though. I can only experience my life to a certain degree. 

That is to say, it's not helpful to my problems right now to know that other people have problems too. However, sometimes knowing that other people are struggling does inspire me to handle my own problems on my own. 

Life with BPD is hard and unfair. Every sleight, real or imagined, causes a huge ripple of anxiety and pain that I then have to work twice as hard to cope with. Most days are a struggle. None of my friends really understand what I go through. They might see flashes of it, but they don't know the true weight. 

All that being said, I'm sorry that you're being told this. It's not helpful. It's lazy emotional support and it feels bad. 

But, you're alive. You're here. You have the power to cope and overcome. You're working twice as hard for half the results, but I believe in you. We can do it.

(I'm sorry. That was wildly disjointed and I dont know if it was helpful. Haha.) 

TL;DR: You're right. It is shitty. I see you and validate you."
IWantToLearn,fpcy1v4,t1_fpcxvkp,1588515588.0,"Sure thing. Listening, really listening, is a skill like anything else. The more you cultivate it, the more your friends will feel seen and heard. 

Sometimes we just want someone to see us as we are and be recognized. 

Good luck out there."
IWantToLearn,fpcxrn6,t3_gcr8m0,1588515391.0,"Honestly, the best thing to do is listen. Just listen and acknowledge their struggle. Human beings are complicated. Sometimes we want advice and sometimes we just want to voice our pain. 

Ask your friend what they want when they start talking. ""Advice or you just need to rant?"" This will also help them figure out why they're reaching out.

Usually, when a friend is venting to me, I listen and validate their feelings. ""I'm so sorry that happened."" ""Like, fuck. That sounds shitty."" Etc. 

Then, I'll ask them, ""Anything I can do?"" And then i go from there. 

Even if my friend is in the wrong, as they sometimes are, i wait until the big emotions pass before broaching the subject. 

Hope that helps."

mentalhealth,fofvicc,t3_g7amiz,1587743550.0,"I got really, really tired of fighting it and finally turned around and asked, ""What do you want from me!?""

At first the voice harped on the latest of a long list of demands. ""Stop laughing like that."" ""Stop bothering everyone."" ""Lose weight."" ""Try harder. Be better. Be perfect.""

But I kept pressing her. What did she really want? How could I possibly, 'Be perfect'? Like what did that even mean?

Eventually, the voice broke down. ""I'm doing this to protect you because if i hold you to an impossibly high standard and you meet it, then no one can ever make you feel worthless. If I make you perfect, then no one can hurt you anymore.""

""Ah. Ok. Well. Aren't there better ways of protecting me? Beating me down isn't really working anymore. Can we try something else? Maybe building me up? Maybe supporting me?""

The voice considered this. If her true goal was to protect me, then how was hurting me a good approach? It made no sense. Pushing myself to do better is one thing, but whipping myself until I bleed is another. 

So, I started healing. Now we're working together, that voice and I. I listened to her and made her listen to me.

sex,fkmgw55,t3_fjbs47,1584328736.0,"I'd focus less on the concept of losing virginity and more on the concept of stretching the vagina, as that is most likely the issue. She's too tight and penetration feels painful. 

The best way to address this, for myself anyway, was to work myself up to larger sizes, so to speak. If you are willing, you guys can try a smaller toy or even just fingers to see where she is comfortable and then go from there. 

Lube and various positions can help sometimes, but seeing as you've tried that, I'd start with fingers. As the vagina relaxes during arousal, bigger insertions are possible, so experiment with some light fingering, get her really turned on, and see if that helps. 

Good luck."

fantasywriters,fix7wi1,t3_fad0iv,1582814755.0,"Focus not only on the events, but on the people. The characters in your world are what will help make it feel real. Even small NPCs can have rich and interesting lives. They dont all need to be epic heroes and they shouldn't be, but they have dreams. They have interests and painful memories. They're alive and living people have many idiosyncrasies. Include some of them. 

Small details are what make a place feel real, so make sure to spend some time on not only the names of places, but their inner workings. For example, a tavern. What are the tables made of? Are some tables missing chairs? Why? How is the room lit? What is the house special?

Think of your own life and the world around you and try to include details that you notice about your own surroundings. The world is made up of choices.

Persona5,fhjqlpm,t3_f3mgpl,1581652867.0,"I would disagree with this, actually. Persona 3 is all about grief, which is a much subtler topic than Persona 5's theme of rebellion. 

Grief is an insidious thing. It sneaks into your life in small ways before it completely takes over your life. It's a true sorrow; soft and hopeless with sudden bursts of anger. It's a very complex theme and I feel they actually capture it brilliantly. 

Rebellion, on the other hand, is simpler. It's the flash of the self against the backdrop of society. It's no less meaningful or exciting, but it is simpler to grasp.

The issue isn't necessarily that you are emotionally attached to your laptop. You probably are, but many of us are emotionally attached to objects that make us feel good, or just less alone. 

Start with giving yourself some space and forgive yourself for your anxiety rather than judging it. Seek help from people who know and love you. Try to talk to a professional about your anxiety and read as much as you can on the topic. 

Breathe. Take some deep breaths. I've struggled with leaving the house too. Many of us have struggles with anxiety. You can do this. 

I'm not belittling your experience. If it's anything like what I've experienced, then I know it's no joke. Anxiety is no joke. But the key is putting it in perspective. Good luck."

Haha. I was super embarrassed the first time I did it, so I get how she feels. On the bright side, it means that the sex was really good."

Good luck out there."
