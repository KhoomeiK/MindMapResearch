ACTrade,fr0vclv,t1_fqwxdu5,1589807610.0,"Ngl, the population of this forum is very entitled and rude when they don't get lopsided trades. If there's a giveaway but they don't win then they feel the need to punish you. If you don't want to do a trade because it's not in your best interest they'll go and complain on the main sub about how ""greedy"" everyone is when they're actually the greedy ones. I really can't wait for the lifespan of this game to shake out those who will eventually move on to new games and leave the AC core community to some friendly trading. Some people here just only accept free or next to free and will literally bully you if you don't sacrifice yourself for their gain.
