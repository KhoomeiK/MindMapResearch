You actually had real genuine relationships with professors that I know many of my friends that went to UCs did not have the ability to have purely because of the amount of students.

So go to the grocery store if you absolutely need supplies, don‚Äôt just go as an activity or just to get one item you are craving. Use your best judgement. If it‚Äôs too crowded better to wait it out or try to go at another time. Don‚Äôt panic buy, just get what you need :)"

I am a research scientist. Just because the cases are lower today, doesn‚Äôt mean anything it all has to do with how many people are being tested which is still incredibly low. 

This will get a lot worse before it gets better. Social distancing and shelter in place are in place to help dampen the blow but if people are not actually following them then there is no point. It only takes one infected person not following the rules.

It‚Äôs crazy expensive here in the bay but everyone is making it work because there is a lot of opportunities to work at some really cool companies and once you are a candidate here you are higher on the list than if they have to relocate someone (usually).

It‚Äôs a bummer because that‚Äôs usually your first taste of what being in biotech/pharma is and it makes a lot of people not go into the industry if you have a professor that talks down to you like your an idiot.  I am lucky to have found a supportive biotech start up, but of course there are pros and cons to working for a big company vs. startups. I always like startups but you also risk being out of a job if they go under which has also happened to me. Let me know if you have any more questions."
biotech,fk1d65g,t1_fk0xzai,1583777262.0,"I almost didn‚Äôt go into the industry because of a negative PI that I did undergrad research with. It all depends on the company so make sure it is a good fit for you before you take a job. At my company we do personality tests so your manager and team knows how to work with each other best. I am someone that does not respond well to someone yelling at me, or approaching me when angry, so my manager talks to me accordingly. I imagine though at bigger pharmaceutical companies or biotech companies they might not take your needs as much into account (more of a cog in the machine) 

I mean you can look at whatever protocols you want out of work. But usually your work will have their own protocols that are specific to what they are doing. I would definitely use those if they have them because everyone does things a little different depending on what you are trying to achieve. If they don‚Äôt have SOPs for you to read recommend it when they ask how training is going. I rewrite my companies protocols in my lab notebook in language I can understand, before I will be shadowing the process. I always have the notebook on me. This is helpful to me but I am also the only one who is always carrying a notebook. I think printing the protocols and running around with a bunch of loose papers shows unprofessionalism. I write the protocols first before I shadow someone, then we do a supervised example where they watch me and then I am independent from there on out, if I feel comfortable.  I think this is a really helpful way to set up training. 

Again, I can‚Äôt stress this enough to speak up, they can‚Äôt read your mind they don‚Äôt know what you do or don‚Äôt know so tell them. No one is going to look down at you or think you are dumb usually they are really receptive to questions. They want you to do well and do things the right way and make sure you have a good understanding of the concept (if you have a good team/manager)"
biotech,fk0x552,t3_fftxno,1583768091.0,"It is all about how you talk to your team, and you have to speak up. A lot of times yes they assume you know things because they have been doing it for so long it is second nature to your team/ the person training to you. Sit with your manager and talk about how training will look and what works best for you. Yes they want you to  be done training sooner rather than later but you aren‚Äôt any help if you are making mistakes/ or doing it completely wrong. So ALWAYS ASK QUESTIONS and most companies will have SOPs you can familiarize/rewrite/ watch YouTube videos on the techniques.  Some good questions to ask‚Äú oh I‚Äôm not familiar with this technique can I shadow you first‚Äù, ‚Äú I don‚Äôt have X background could you breakdown why we are doing this step‚Äù ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt feel comfortable doing that on my own yet can we go through it one more time‚Äù ‚Äúhow did you get to that number‚Äù things along those lines. It also helps the people training you sharpen their techniques and remembering to go back to basics. So basically if you stand there and say nothing they will assume you know these things and move quickly. I am in training right now with something I don‚Äôt have any background in, so I hope this advice helps!"
