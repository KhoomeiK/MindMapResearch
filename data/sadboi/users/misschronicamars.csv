Like, technology advances. And it costs more at first. Cell phones were a fuckton more expensive than landlines, then smartphones were a fuckton more expensive than basic phones. It‚Äôs just evolution.

Kanye,flfzhhu,t1_flf95wz,1585124079.0,"Kim leaked the ""incriminating"" snippet in 2016 and called Taylor a snake, which led to ""taylorswiftisoverparty"" being the number one trending on Twitter. Her social media was littered with people leaving snake emojis and saying pretty terrible things. There's a video at his concert of the entire audience chanting ""fuck Taylor Swift!"" over and over. 

But the takeaway is that Kim deliberately lied and posted that video to fuck Taylor over, and it worked. And she nor Kanye ever admitted that it was a lie. That's purposeful defamation, and it's just petty and gross and typical Kardashian antics. 

It's not ""why is Taylor canceling Kanye?"" It's ""Their lies caught up with them and now people are reacting to it."" Cancel culture is stupid, no one should be canceled, and Taylor isn't the one doing it. People always like to pull ""she plays the victim."" But like, this time, and every time with Kanye, she HAS been the victim. 

The irony is that in the video Kanye asks her to promote the song, before it's even done, and she declines. So he comes up with the line ""I made that bitch famous."""

Like some others said, she knew they wanted her to be a villain so she gave them nothing to work with. She knew how to play the TV game well, and just happens to be a troll. She was so over snatch game that she actually left set when she put up the cardboard cutout. She sat in the werkroom and they had to coax her back, it wasn't just a minute long thing.

It's just an all around great lil machine. It doesn't lag unless you have like, maybe 10 tabs open with a video or music playing. But it's always relatively zippy. And the battery lasts forever. Usually 10 hours easy. The only thing I'd complain about is the speakers suuuck. So quiet and tinny. But I use a Bluetooth speaker with it, so that's a trade-off I'm willing to make for 200 bucks.
