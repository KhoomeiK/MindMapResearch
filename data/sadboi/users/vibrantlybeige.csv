Look up the ""bullet journal"" method to help you organize your life and settle your mind. This helps in so many ways, but the main one is being able to rest your mind because you've dumped out all your tasks, schedules, thoughts on paper! 

I also find it extremely useful, at the end of each day (in my bullet journal), to write down the things I'm grateful for that day (delicious coffee, nice message from friend, etc) and stuff I got done that day (researched how to design labels, made a batch of food for the week, etc). I almost always feel like I didn't do enough, so being able to see what I did that day really puts things in perspective. The gratitude stuff has helped me immensely; it prevents me from ruminating on negative things and shifts the focus to the *stuff that's going right*. 

PS. If you're not getting enough calories *and* not enough sleep, you're going to feel so so much worse. You can't expect your brain to focus and work hard when you're literally starving it!

Excerpts from the above link (but please visit the link for way more information!):
>Proportional systems usually have a threshold of support a party must meet to win seats. 4-5% is common.
 >In Canada’s last few federal elections, all 15-20 “fringe” parties put together didn’t get 1% of the vote.


Also worth checking this page out, pertaining to ""extremists"" under a PR system: https://www.fairvote.ca/factcheckextremists/


Different types of proportional representation recommended for Canada:


* **Mixed Member Proportional (MMP)** representation was recommended by the Law Commission of Canada (2004) and several provincial commissions. Variations of MMP are used in New Zealand, Germany, Scotland and Wales: https://www.fairvote.ca/mixed-member-proportional/


* **Single Transferable Vote (PR-STV) and Local PR** 
Single Transferable Vote was recommended by the British Columbia Citizens Assembly (2004) and went on to receive 58% of the vote in the 2005 referendum. STV is used nationally in Ireland, in four Australian territories, in Scotland for local elections, and was used provincially in Winnipeg, Calgary and Edmonton for 30 years. It is the original proportional representation system: https://www.fairvote.ca/stv/


* **Rural-Urban Proportional**
Rural-Urban Proportional builds on the work of previous commissions and assemblies, and combines elements of top up systems (such Mixed Member Proportional) and multi-member systems (such Single Transferable Vote and Local PR) to meet the challenges of Canada’s geography: https://www.fairvote.ca/rural-urban-proportional/"

Planes in dreams represent your life's journey, or sometimes spiritual journey. It can mean higher consciousness, newer freedom, greater awareness. 

Unexpected plane crashes can represent unexpected events that turn your life upside down. 

To see an airplane falling from the sky and feeling helpless or sad; can indicate that you are setting yourself up for failure. You have the predetermined notion of difficult challenge and failure, which unintentionally sabotages your own efforts.

Your neighborhood in a dream represents a sense of community and the need to be more socially active. It's a need to develop new friends and new ties. 

So perhaps you have been trying to build a sense of community, or a social network, and you feel your efforts are failing. You have lofty goals or desires that seem too difficult to achieve so you don't even try."

canada,fosquh0,t1_foshmsh,1588036160.0,"It's true that there will be major adjustments, but to those people I would say that things were *not okay* before this. 

Wages have stagnated for 30 years, the 2008 financial crisis was ""solved"" simply by changing institutional debt to personal debt (essentially you and I bailed out the banks), the cost of post secondary education is out of control, funding is continuously being cut to education and healthcare, housing prices are out of control pretty much everywhere (housing should *not* be an investment!), and climate collapse is threatening *all of us*. Majority of us were one paycheque away from homelessness already, and the average citizen would not be able to afford a $500 emergency cost. People have been warning of the imminent death of the oil and gas industry for years, trying to get government to invest in transitioning to renewable energy sources. The fishing industry is dying as our oceans die, and the dairy industry is dwindling as tastes change. So many meetings and conferences that could have been held remotely, instead required hundreds/thousands of flights across the world. People were spending huge chunks of time commuting in traffic just so they could have an affordable residence *and* a good job. 

I could go on and on about all the reasons why life was shit for the 99%. 

Due to this pandemic, we've seen what we can do and how quickly we can act when we work together: 

* We've got a framework for Universal Basic Income (check out [UBI works](http://www.ubiworks.ca/) or sign the [Green Party's petition](https://www.greenparty.ca/en/adopt-gli) for livable income).

* Politicians are trying to establish an internal, nonpartisan, committee for tackling climate collapse. 

* This has demonstrated that so many people could easily work remotely, which opens up so many more possibilities for employees and businesses alike. 

* This is highlighting the importance of affordable data plans and internet access for rural areas, and several people are pushing for change from big telecom. 

* Oil and gas workers have jobs cleaning up old wells, and I heard that trade school will be free? 

* We will see some manufacturing return to Canada. 

* We've shown that our so-called ""essential workers"" aren't being paid enough; this should hopefully lead to changes in the way our cashiers, cleaners, truck drivers, long term healthcare, nurses, etc are compensated (or it just strengthens the argument for UBI!). 

* Positive changes to our long-term care facilities and the way we treat our seniors.

* Airbnb is dead in our major cities which is so incredibly good for the affordable housing crisis. 

* We're seeing a lot of attention being paid to mental health, and some provinces have started government-funded programs! 

* This will definitely stop the ridiculous push for online classes after seeing how ineffective they are, and hopefully will highlight the importance of education funding. 

* We're showing how quickly nature could bounce back if we stopped consuming and burning so much. We're being confronted with our wasteful, consumerist ways.

* We're seeing how government *should* work together by cooperating: this is how it could be with a Proportional Representation system! (Check out [Fair Vote Canada](http://www.fairvote.ca/))

* The government is forced to deal with our 2:1 debt to income ratio which is totally unsustainable, and was the main thing driving our economy.

So, have hope people! Take this amazing, *once in a century*, opportunity to shape the future the way *we want*. Sign petitions, check out [The Leap](http://www.theleap.org/), call/message your MPs, talk to your friends... **we can't go back to 'normal' because normal was the problem!**"

Anxiety,fomeo9n,t3_g1ywkr,1587887294.0,"You need to learn how to research and solve problems *before* they cause panic. A schedule or bullet journal system could help: what's coming up on the next 6 months, this month, this week, today. What are your goals? What are your tasks? Get organized and stay on top of things.

Mindfulness allows you to give your brain a much needed break, so you can think calmly and clearly when you need to. Taking a 20-30 minute break to meditate won't stop you from completing your tasks for the near future, but it *will* help you to do so.

Your anxiety isn't helping you overcome problems, it's *causing* your problems in the first place: dropping out of university and unable to work. Please listen to your counselors, exercise daily, mediate daily, and practice self care."
