IMO, that's a dick comment ""because you're a woman,"" this is coming from another woman who wants to give you props for finishing the game. It took me 8 hours on my first try, so I feel your pain with running around and shit.

It was hella scary and annoying at times. I did Leon A/Claire B for my first total run-through of the entire game. I finished Claire A and I'm working on Leon B right now. 

I still would recommend doing Claire B (altered story, locations, and weapons), plus the true ending (additional boss fight), and the Ghost Survivors. As much as we all can recommend going one way or the other, all up to you whether you want to continue playing around with the game."

DecidingToBeBetter,fbcuzws,t3_ecehgo,1576734775.0,"**This resonated so strongly with me.** 

My boyfriend and I have been together for 1.5 years, and I've spent some time around his friends and their significant others (all of whom are cis-men and are with cis-women). I'm Asian and my boyfriend is White - from an area that is also predominantly white (as in at the two parties I've been to, there were NO people of color besides myself).

The girlfriends/fiancées/spouses of his larger friend group are all also close with each other. It's a little intimidating because I want to integrate with them as well. However, we live one state over, so there hasn't been opportunities to get to know the ladies. I've seen on Instagram that they all follow each other, or hangout occasionally. They've been really pleasant with me, and have no reason to dislike me.

I became very paranoid that my boyfriend's twin's fiancée (yes, it's a mouthful) did not like me for some reason, although her behavior and conversations with me show completely otherwise. However, I found myself over this last year doing what I could to gain her ""approval"" and ""friendship."" I was driving myself nuts (I also have anxiety and depression) comparing myself to her in secret and having a toxic narrative in my head about how she is better than me personally, socially, professionally, aesthetically, etc. No one, not even my boyfriend, knows that I feel like this. It's just so toxic and disparaging to my mental health to bully myself like this.

I'm very introverted, and it doesn't help that I feel like I can't relate to my boyfriend's friends and S/O's easily. I'm on this journey of self-loving and understanding that I don't need approval from everyone around me. These stem from my personal insecurities, but I'm so relieved to know that there are others in a situation like me."

It's so hard to ask for references with immediate colleagues and supervisors, depending on the relationship that you have with them. Do you get along with your supervisor or any colleague on a PROFESSIONAL LEVEL with no personal issues? Even those cordial relationships are better than not having a professional reference. I think having friends and contacts in your industry can speak to your ability to network and diversify your perspectives, as well as, shed good character light for you.

College is a tumultuous time for a lot of people. I look back on it now, and I realize that it was a lot like high school in many ways.

relationships,er3d2dt,t3_c05or6,1560460662.0,"Hey, OP! Weirdly enough, I have a perspective from that of your ex-gf... bear with me!

One of my friends is still in a 10-year relationship with her boyfriend since the 9th grade. That being said, it was clear from high school that she wanted to end things with him. She just never did — but would confide in me and others routinely about their incompatibility, etc. I graduated high school in 2012...

Over the years, she has kissed with other people and is currently exploring her sexuality — all while being with her boyfriend. Throughout this period, I’ve never supported her relationship, but I interacted and have spent time with them (it’s not my place to say anything to the BF). Now, my friend has a history of hiding/white lies due to her insecurities — so, I’ve become weary of her choices and life situations (she’s lied about school, etc. — not maliciously, but it hurts when a friend can’t trust you with the truth and to support her.). She moved in with her boyfriend about two years ago, and has since shared that they’re in an open-relationship.

Fast forward to last weekend, I haven’t seen her in six months — and she suddenly shared with me that she has been seeing her co-worker and developing feelings and a connection with him. The worst thing, she hasn’t held up her end of the agreement and did not communicate anything about him to her boyfriend FOR THE LAST SIX MONTHS. I was caught off-guard because this wasn’t the purpose of their open relationship (which should have ended in the first place...), but it led me to this: my friend wanted to minimize the hurt and impact of the relationship she has with her boyfriend and has used the excuse of an open relationship to explore connections, intimacy, and relationships without the heavy conscience. My friend isn’t the kind of person that would thrive in open relationships and she is actually really hurting her boyfriend by keeping him in the dark about it — I even consider it cheating, despite the “open relationship.”

I’m assuming your ex is feeling the same thing, she loves you and wants you in her life for the sake of keeping those built relationships, but isn’t sparing you details about her personal life because she can’t deal with a guilty conscience.

EDIT: Which is inherently selfish of my friend withholding information from her boyfriend and pondering breaking up with him under the guise that they're just not compatible."

relationships,epb9vry,t3_bub9fo,1559139750.0,"Girl, you’re such an inspiration for valuing your self-worth and knowing that you’re so much better than his cheating ass. From reading, it sounds like, albeit difficult, you are moving forward and knowing that you will be able to handle everything healthily. That being said, don’t minimize the harassment that your asshole ex-fiancé is persisting with. If you need to seek assistance, protection, and intervention — speak to law enforcement and learn of best options."
xxfitness,eowlvnz,t1_eovqvgu,1558911610.0,"I’m not “fit” — I honestly think I’m average, but it’s so hard to just reason in the moment with different perspectives when I was being reprimanded sternly. It is a policy that is designed to be more “inclusive,” but ended up being enforced poorly."
xxfitness,eowlixh,t1_eovmoge,1558911473.0,"He lives 20 minutes away from the gym! My midriff wasn’t exposed, I wear high-waisted training pants that  cover up to my ribs. My crop top ended where my pants-line began. Policies just aren’t dictated well and there is a larger issue with women in gyms that just need to be addressed overall."
xxfitness,eowkm9f,t1_eovv66a,1558911109.0,"Mm, well I think anyone would have an embarrassed reaction to innocently wanting to attend as a guest of a member to a gym and then being rudely told otherwise... but, that’s just entitled me I guess! 

Not that discrimination at gyms against women haven’t been a pervasive issue for a long time. Also, I wasn’t told of the policy until that moment and I left, clearly obeying it. Can’t a girl just workout? Haha!"

confession,eotg9ve,t3_bt1o9g,1558840614.0,"Your level of comfort with others is what is paramount to everything else. While you may worry about the quantity — the unmeasurable quality of relationships you do have is something to be cherished! 

Friends or no friends, you choose to live your life the way you feel that you are content. I have social anxiety as well; and it’s paralyzing at times because I always worry over strangers to the closest people in my life. At the end of the day, you know you are loved and you love as well."
