autism,flhiigb,t3_foj8bt,1585163305.0,"2¢ of Advice: Just be nice. That’s about 95% of the job of being a good human right there. I find that when people are able to trust, especially people with autism tend to reveal what their issue or strengths are as a way of getting ahead of any potential misunderstandings. So maybe on an everyday/mundane basis, keep the habit of responding with genuine kindness and acceptance. Over time you’ll form a more complete picture of how to proceed next. Sounds fluffy but it works...and it’s all I got."

NotionSo,fldyrez,t3_fo2aie,1585074331.0,"1. Nope
2. It‘s been discussed and softly promised
3. It has been a highly requested feature

The important thing to note about the request is that it would require a serious overhaul of a lot of code, at the foundational level, followed by testing, testing again and final deployment. It’s no small feat, and takes time. That’s the bad news.   
The good news is that it seems to be a big priority—if for no reason than the fact that there is stiff competition out there with other apps taking over the space if Notion does not rise to the occasion. So even though we’re being cautiously optimistic over very irregular promises made, it’s a safe bet that it’s high on the list of priority. 

So far I have not seen anything match the ease of use and flexibility of Notion, and I don’t have the bandwidth to go looking elsewhere."
autism,fldy214,t1_fldpa6s,1585073946.0,"Seems like this is a time of immense transformation for you. It is, in small measure, the case for most people around us. In that sense, not only are we not alone, but also everyone is a little displaced, I think. I’ve noticed people are getting a little desperate out there...and I don’t mean just toilet paper hoarding either. There are some that I thought were rational people who are finger pointing and acting irrational. This COVID-19 thing is not bringing out the best in us.   
BUT I think it’s going to be interesting to see where everyone stands once this has played out. And it will come to a conclusion, we just have to be patient. 

FYI, I’ve reached out to a bunch of my “friends” AND “family” last week who, every time I get them, will complain that I don’t call often enough, don’t keep in touch. Well, these bastards never reach out to me. Of all of them, two responded to my voicemail, saying they’re busy but politely saying they’d get in touch over the weekend. And they [did](https://did.In)...in my dream. Nobody has called, texted or reached out. 

Since yesterday, I’ve been walking around regretting the mistake of even reaching out. BUT whatever. I think it is time to get a canary. They’re sensitive, like me. Plus they’re bright and yellow and hopeful.   


Hang tight. Reach out if you feel so inclined."

autism,fldwgdq,t1_flcwb11,1585073053.0," I am guessing it is a little confusing to have an added layer on top of the disorientation that comes with being in a new place that is not new, yet new.  And I mean that about the place as much as the person(s). The last time I saw my mum was a few years ago, after I came to know about my autism. I had not been around her for years before (I’ve been an expatriate for a couple of decades). So it was an interesting exercise to notice how the new revelation of my “self” was in relation to how things were before. Helped me actually put some distance between my past self and present self so that I could at least think of my old self as someone “who just didn’t know”. And my mum...well, she’s on her own “trip” haha!"

It's bad when you're alone but I think worse when you have someone that loves you but you can't discuss these things with because they will freak the fuck out and eventually blame themselves or whatever. Anyway, like I said, I was dealing with a lot from my dad's death (and unresolved issues) to being fired from my job...and  coming to terms about being  literally fired from every full time job I have ever gotten, with no understanding of what I did wrong in each case..everyone I know tells me I'm a nice person, and easy to get along with and super on top of my job.  Anyway, long story short, I stumbled on Jordan Peterson on YouTube where he was discussing his book 12 Rules . Changed my perspective completely for the better."

shopify,ew1rdl6,t3_cm8gn7,1565029738.0,"You should start building a store around a solid idea that you are absolutely in love with. From that idea you have a product or set of products that you will take to market. Could be something you make, or something you resell.  
Here's the point: starting an online store is easy, making your first sale (to someone that you're not dating, friends with or related to) is a climb up a mountain. It requires a good amount of unrewarding work in aspects that you were never prepared to even think about, let alone contemplate doing yourself or (god forbid!) having to pay someone else to do. It's very likely you're going to be in the trenches for a while before you make that first sale. So you better really love the product, AND your reason for putting the product out there for people to buy. Because if you don't, it'll feel like ""work."" Worse still, unpaid, unrewarding work. With your pride attached to it for good measure."
