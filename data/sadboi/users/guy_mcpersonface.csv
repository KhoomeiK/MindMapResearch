PoliticalMemes,fqtahwl,t1_fqt8ap0,1589634635.0,"By my understanding, under libertarianism there would be a small government, but still a government. You may be thinking of anarcho-capitalism, which  has absolutely no government. Not trying to advocate for libertarianism, just trying to say could probably work.

Also my point was it's not a fair comparison, that's all."
