A good doctor would know to do an arterial blood (quick and easy) 

your oxygen would be really high and carbon really low if it was hyperventilation/anxiety and youf be in alkalosis.

Othet results (eg low oxygen) would make pneumonia or lung embolism or ... more likely! 

Even just a saturation meter on your finger would help. What a dumb doctor"
