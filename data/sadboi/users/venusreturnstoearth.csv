The process was quick for me because I was in a bad place and experiencing psychotic symptoms. I also had two months left till I finished my degree. Getting diagnosed was my last hope. I just wanted to finish school, it was year six of my undergrad. 

First, you have a phone call meeting with a provider for about twenty minutes to figure out what state you’re in. Then that week I saw a therapist on campus. We talked for about an hour. I had been experiencing symptoms for over ten years so I knew myself pretty well. I told her, it seems like bipolar disorder to me but I don’t care what you call it I just need help. I saw her a few more times before I was sent to a psychiatrist on campus, who saved my life. The medication dumbed my down and after almost years I’m okay with that. I was about to squeeze my work out and barely finish. I ended up in the hospital two weeks after graduation. I continued to see the psychiatrist for months until I found someone off campus. 

Best of luck, friend."

You did a great job of communicating. I appreciate you talking to me about this. Docs need to take a class or something because there is a way to do it."

What I don’t like about the language (I studied language in various forms for 7 years in college so I’m a little jittery about the subject) is that it felt like she was generalizing the human condition. Which is hard to even talk about sometimes because we all use different language. I don’t think she was negating my experience but I do feel she was generalizing human experience to some extent to try and relate. But yanno I fucking know people who haven’t done the shit I have. Yanno. Even she stared at me and paused when I was explaining how I act when I’m premenstrual. That’s it. I’m going back to her for a ton of other reasons, I think she can help me greatly.

I had never met anyone who was helpful, patient, realistic about my situation, as well as funny and gentle around me. I wish I could have been closer to her. I know that she shows this tenderness to me and her other patients. We are all so lucky and changed by it all.
