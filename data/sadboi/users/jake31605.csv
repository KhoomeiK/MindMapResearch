Suicidal_Thoughts,fqoxvth,t3_gk43gv,1589528242.0," I don‚Äôt know. I feel like I‚Äôd I was the friend I would be in kind of a pickle here not being able to know which was the better decision, telling someone or not. I feel like I should respect their wishes because If something brought them to the point they want to kill themselves I think it‚Äôs probably pretty bad and telling someone after they asked me not to might make it worse. But telling someone might get them help and maybe they will be able to be happy again."
