So our first neighbours are Sisterly and Jock, right? 

Does that mean they lock the personality types you encounter for every stage? Because the 1st 3 I invited were Peppy, Normal, and Lazy, and my first camper was Smug, and from what I've seen in comments on ...I think another ac subreddit everyone else's was Smug as well. 

I'm asking bc I rerolled the island bc I wanted a specific villager, and all I'm finding for the ""first 3 homes"" stage are Normal/ Peppy/ Lazy characters and idk if I'm just overanalyzing or if it's just my RNG being weird since this is my first animal crossing game. I tried looking up info on this but all I've found are articles and posts about how to get them to move out. 

If this is the case though it'd make my life a lot easier, since I'd know which stage I'd need to reroll 

I don't particularly *want* to keep resetting it bc I enjoyed playing it day-by-day (instead of jumping to the past and stopping when I get to the current time irl like I'm doing now with... not a lot of progress xD) but that character is the only thing I actually need in my game so I will if I have to again until I find him

I think that's about it? They're all spikes though, usually last no more than 5 or 10 minutes, I think. Not too sure bc I don't actually keep track, but that sounds about right. Most of my time is spent as a blank canvas, with the spikes of emotion splashing across said canvas and eventually fading to nothingness again."

Twilight was when they'd kiss; a gentle greeting, a slow goodbye. They'll go on forever, until forever is no more."

Schizoid,fhgz06e,t3_f2z4s5,1581585800.0,"Idk 

I'm in a LDR atm and he doesn't seem too concerned about wanting me back with him since he has like a horde of other friends he's closer to (closer with?) to do things with, and we haven't really been doing anything unless I initiate (which is rare since I can think of nothing we can do together) I've kind of been wondering if I should apply for that partner visa thing to be back together if he's ok with this just being a LDR, and if there's a point in keeping the relationship going.

Then again I also wonder what the point of me living is (not in a depressed way tho) so... idk. Probably won't do anything unless he brings it up."

Blender_Wells,fhbmhkz,t1_fhblgd0,1581445322.0,"Hmm I used a UV sphere (I think that was what it was called?) and shaped each parts separately before joining them with boolean, and then sculpted it a little to kinda smooth it out where the seals were. 

It was my 2nd time making anything and I forgot you could set it to smooth shading tho and ended up with like 100k polygons lmao, had to decimate it back to like 4k so it wasn't *that* overkill. 

I think that was about it; I was just playing around trying to match it with how the character looked (it's a mascot of sorts for a streamer I watch) so it's mostly just some tweaking in sculpt mode :D"
Schizoid,fgvprr3,t3_f0jbq3,1581151564.0,"I'm more facetious than anything. Most people irl find me to be overly serious, though I think that's more because I don't bother with a mask and I don't usually speak in front of people. The rare times I did input something I've been met with stunned looks because they didn't think I could speak, let alone joke about something."
