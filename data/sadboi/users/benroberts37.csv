1. You're willing to be patient with us and our process. You will be our first real client.
2. You are willing to fill out our application form - It is a bit lengthy but that is because we take our screening process seriously and want to ensure we are helping the people that need it most.
3. You are currently financially stretched. We are hoping to find someone that is ready and willing to get help, but cannot afford it.
4. Willing to put up a very small % of the cost (Less than 10%) - We believe that having a small amount of ""skin in the game"" will help hold you more accountable.

mentalhealth,fi8v0ts,t3_evt061,1582248991.0,"I think it can help to open up online first. You can spend time writing out your story and your feelings and seeing what comes out. I  did this recently and ended up writing like 15 pages about things I've been through. 

I'm actually apart of a non-profit group and we are trying to collect people's mental health stories. If you want, you can visit our website at [overtfoundation.org/share](https://overtfoundation.org/share) and you can try sharing your story anonymously online first, and that might help you be willing to share openly in real life."

Similar to Shattered\_minds, on the comments, I am working with a non-profit to collect people's stories on our website. We just launched and we have a few people that have shared their stories, but I was wondering if you would as well! you can just copy and paste what you posted here or type it out again.

If you're willing, I think it would help people that read it. You can share it at [overtfoundation.org/share](https://overtfoundation.org/share)"

hiking,fi2wuel,t3_f669m1,1582091656.0,"Best backpacking near banff is lake O’Hara and mount Assiniboine. Both require permits and planning ahead of time. There are some good online guides as to how to go about booking and planning these.

Also berg lake is further north near jasper, but definitely worth doing."
mentalhealth,fi2onk7,t1_fi2mtkb,1582084806.0,"We’re hoping to provide a space for people to openly share their stories as well as read other people’s stories. We believe that a lot of people are struggling and by opening up and also reading about how others overcome their struggles or went through something similar, that that might help.

Would love to hear your thoughts or opinions on this if you have any!"

Entrepreneur,fhgsgny,t3_f362t8,1581577277.0,Webflow is a good option. Similar to Wordpress but less coding
depression,fhfluiq,t3_f2z9gy,1581546046.0,I believe things can get better for everyone. Do not go through with this and seek help and I really think that you can achieve happiness and fulfillment
eczema,fhflhlu,t3_f2z5qn,1581545828.0,Mine is way worse in the winter. I actually never really have issues during the summer.
CampingandHiking,fhfipop,t1_fhfhl5y,1581544175.0,Yeah reservations in Yosemite are hard to get. I’ve slept in my car in parking lots right outside the park and then just getting in early is important in the summer because of how crowded it gets by 9am. If you’re by yourself sometimes you can drive into the campsites and just ask to park in the same spot as someone and split the campsite cost with them but it’s a little risky haha. The coast near Big Sur/garrapata area is really awesome and there are some really cool areas to see. It’s definitely hard to choose where to go haha.
CampingandHiking,fhfgrlq,t3_f2xydq,1581543057.0,"Canadian Rockies have some of the best. Mount Assiniboine, lake O’Hara and berg lake trail are all amazing"
CampingandHiking,fhfgftl,t3_f2y70v,1581542870.0,"Not sure how far north you are going to be but i would recommend: point lobos park, Big Sur, garrapata park, Marin headlands, mount Shasta area, redwood national park, Davenport/Santa Cruz area, and then not sure if you’ll be near Yosemite but that’s always a fun one! These are some of my favorites but you’ll have to map them out to see if you’ll be near them"

depression,ff7prcl,t3_es48jc,1579655375.0,"I know how you feel, it can be tough to realize that we lost a lot of time, but that is not something we can change unfortunately. I have some family members that were homeless and struggled with a lot of things, but have since gotten out of their situation and become very successful not only financially but also have great families and lives now. It can hard to not focus on our past but your past is what made you who you are today. I struggle with the same thing sometimes but I try to focus on what I can accomplish in the future. Best of luck to you in everything :)"
