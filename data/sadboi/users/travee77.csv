Psychosis,fj4jfqy,t3_fb2wd5,1583009672.0,"I'll attempt to communicate an idea that came to me.  This is ofcourse non professional and should be dealt with accordingly.


The apex of spirituality is within the atheist in gods good Graces.

God does not want to be communicating with you on a personal level day in and day out, god wants you to experience the joy of being an independent autonomous agent.  Like any parent the goal is to let go of the bike seat eventually.     

Persist in the obsession with direct contact and the trouble of insanity occurs.   There is no great outcome involved.   

I would advise trusting your community.  We both know that surrendering to the psychosis is the easy ""wide"" path.  The narrow path is to deal with life on lifes terms.    

Good luck."
