bulimia,fk9l1v1,t3_ff8xqk,1583978149.0,"I’m so sorry to hear you are going through this, it is a vicious cycle. I’ve been in the same situation and running can be a double edged sword- great for increasing endorphins and overall health but not great if you aren’t fueling right. 
What really helped me was starting some weight lifting and putting on some muscle- sounds like you are already active so building some lean muscle mass will probably go a long way for you. 
I really like Natasha Oceane’s philosophy on youtube - she’s a british youtuber who’s been through binge and purge cycles and Overcome them with therapy and proper fueling for exercise. 
One of my favourite things she said is “the way you look is the least interesting part of you” which is so true. Be active because it makes you feel good, nourish your body with rest and good nutrition and keep your mental health in check by seeking help and self compassion. 
I know it’s so hard I hope you find some relief from this best of luck!!"

WeightLossAdvice,fk35g8i,t1_fk2qmae,1583818391.0,Oh very interesting technique but makes a lot of sense! Thanks so much for the detailed response for the tip!
WeightLossAdvice,fk224bk,t1_fk1rn6c,1583791527.0,"I've done fasting and intermittent fasting but  it always ends up in a binge after. I'm actually surprised to see this recommendation, albeit very interested in trying this.  Somehow this sounds very unhealthy. Isn't water crucial for all organ, cells, and systems in your body??"
CBDoil,fk11p9e,t1_fk0e287,1583770674.0,I wish. you can order from them as they’ve regulated it here

Anxiety,fjkwtqv,t1_fjjf2kq,1583435472.0,"This is such nice advice thank you for this answer. I do this with going to the gym (one place where it’s societally accepted to not look good as a women), but I like this idea of self care and following through on your intentions in order to make yourself feel valued.
Thank you!"

AskReddit,f7jmopd,t1_f7jln4a,1573781212.0,Definitely been there. But is that the way to work with others in the world? There must be better means of communication if you don't agree with someone. Also I don't want to always do all the work. Don't really think anyone expects me too either.
Anxiety,f7jhtov,t1_f7jb56z,1573777921.0,Do it up! There are a lot of opportunities on the tech side if you find an an area that incorporates UI/UX then you're golden.
