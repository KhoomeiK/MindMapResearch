(first, apologize my English, I'm not a native speaker)

From my experience I can say there is a ""too small"" but if you are bigger than this everything else depends on what you(both) are doing, and how well you know each other.

Once I had a guy with a dick too small. It was hard for me, because I didn't want to hurt his feelings. There was no significant difference in technique etc. I just felt too less to enjoy
But I'm sure he has or will find a girl that fits him.

You are definitely above the ""too small border"".

And what I really want to say :
Dicks are as beauty full and different like every vag out there too!
Ones are smaller, bigger, thicker, thinner. But the woman out there have the same struggles.
They think they look strange, ugly, too different and being not tight enough.

Not every dick fits every vag. And you all will have sexual partners you don't fit, literally.
But that is OK, you don't have to fit all. Whether your really big or too small.
You will find enough that fits you perfectly and if your lucky the other person is really cool and you will spend more than the bed.


Additionally I want to say that want to have a big dick isn't always because woman not satisfied.
I'm in a relationship with an average guy. We are very open and I want to try the big one. Just because I'm curious.
I'm total satisfied with the sex I have. But I'm. Curious.
Just because a woman want to have a bigger one after you doesn't mean that you are too small!
Maybe she just want to try, or she is curious, or she doesn't care about the size.

I'm sure your size is great and there are a lot of persons out there who would say it fits them perfect!"

Aufgewachsen in einem Elternhaus in dem (auch aus fanatisch christlichen Gründen) kein TV, Gameboy, PC etc in meiner Kindheit erlaubt war.

Sehr früh ausgezogen gab es den ersten PC und ich habe mich von Anfang an dafür begeistert. Über das normale Maß hinaus.

Ich bin mittlerweile Gamerin (Nein keine Mädchenspiele), habe mein PC selber zusammengestellt und zusammengebaut, habe mir schon vor 10 Jahren Photoshop selber beigebracht. Bin mittlerweile bei 4 selbst beigebrachten Grafikprogrammen und verdiene nebenbei etwas mit Grafikdesign.

Wenn ich etwas nicht weiß wird gegoogelt, tutorials angeschaut. Ob es um Grafikprogramme geht, oder ich herausfinden möchte, ob ich etwas in diversen Programmen einfacher machen kann. Ich versuche so viel wie möglich zu lernen.
Habe aber auch das Gefühl mich beweisen zu müssen in dieser noch von Männern dominierten Domäne. Bzw. Möchte ich auch nicht als ""dummes Frauchen"" abgestempelt werden.

In meinem Ingenieursstudium, habe ich meinen (ausschließlich) männlichen Kollegen immer wieder ihre Laptops gefixt, Systeme neu aufgesetzt, etc.
Bis auf einen war in meinem Studiengang (~30 Studenten in diesem Jahrgang) keiner, der mehr als Facebook, Instagram und ein paar Spiele an seinem ""PC"" bedienen konnte.

Aber auch nicht technisches ist für viele sehr schwer.
In meiner Zeit als Ausbilderin erkrankte ein Azubi im Blockunterricht. Auf die Frage, warum ich seine Krankmeldung noch nicht erhalten habe meinte er, er wisse nicht wie man ein Brief adressiert. Ich habe ihm google und Youtube als Hilfe vorgeschlagen.
Der Brief kam dann, obwohl falsch adressiert, doch noch bei uns an.
Nebeninfo : seine Eltern waren beim Vorstellungsgespräch dabei, er war 17. Seine Eltern haben ihm eine kleine Wohnung im Arbeitsort besorgt. Seine Mutter ist täglich 20km gefahren um ihm essen zu kochen und sauber zu machen. Auch wurde er täglich via Anruf geweckt."
