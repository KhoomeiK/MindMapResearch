My insurance approved it because it is a generic, but my endo made sure I got that specific brand of generic. Sometimes when I was on the psych ward (or in the hospital for other reasons) I had to take Synthroid or another brand because it was what the hospital pharmacy stocked. That was only briefly though.

A math teacher I worked with during a summer internship was also a pastor of a religion that baptized at birth. He had a grandchild born while I was working with him. Of course his grandchild was baptized. (I think he took some time off for it and I taught the class. Obviously, we didn't know exactly when it would be because babies don't always come on the due date).

Somehow, our different religous beliefs came up, probably because I asked if the baby was being blessed or baptized. (I am not religious and don't believe in God but I wasn't about to tell him that. 'My' religion does bless babies after they are born even though they wait on baptism).  He asked me about all the unbaptized children under the age of eight who died and therefore went to hell. I think I responded by saying that I refused to believe in a God so heartless that he would send innocent children to hell because they weren't baptized.

I am an essential worker (I fill online orders for a grocery store), so I still go to work four days a week. I am grateful to have a job, because many of my friends are out of work right now. Not only is the paycheck nice, but so is having something to do. 

I have a roommate. We have been living together for over seven and a half years. We met at a residential care facility for the mentally ill and both decided we would do much better if we had a roommate when we moved out instead of living alone. She clearly would not be living on her own if I weren't her roommate, but what most people fail to see is how much I need her too.

At the beginning of the pandemic, she went to stay with her mom for a while. She doesn't do well with lots of alone time. I was gone at work four days a week and she was temporarily off work at her job.  So, by staying with her mom (who is retired) she had company. 

While she was gone, I pretty much went to work and stayed home. It was super easy for me to do that. And, I didn't have to feel guilty for not being social because the pandemic meant I wasn't supposed to be social. I talked to my friends on the phone sometimes to check in, but I didn't have to worry about inviting them somewhere or being invited. My roommate is the social person. When she is gone I kind of forget to be social.

Eventually, she got sick of her mom. (I don't blame her, her mom is kinda nuts). She also realized that we are in this for the long haul, so she came home. She has been able to return to work. Our state is trying to open up (way too early), so we are a bit more social. We don't go out at all (other than to grocery shop), but we do have friends over for dinner sometimes. Only one maybe two at a time, no hugging like we used to, wash hands, stay several feet apart etc.

It's become nice outside so we can go for walks. We are also planting a garden with a garden club in hopes to sell our produce this summer. But, it will be very different than in previous years because of new rules for farmers markets.

So, yeah, the not having to be social definitely helps me. But, I do notice that I am in a better mental place now that my roommate is back and we are more social. But, having the pressure off is nice."

tifu,fnx7o14,t1_fnw4fz7,1587333099.0,"There was a news story I read not to long ago about a child who called 911 because their mother was having a medical emergency. The 911 operator kept telling the child that 911 was not a toy and to stop wasting their time. The child called back more than once. I think by the time a police officer was finally sent the mother had died, but I honestly don't remember anymore."

However, during her trial she had a low blood sugar emergency and 911 had to be called. The charges were dropped, but she will probably spend the rest of her life in the residential care facility. 

Once I was calling someone and I *know* I dialed the correct number on my cellphone. But, the phone was answered by a 911 operator. It scared me to death.  I just said I'm really sorry I dialed the wrong number. ( who accidentally dials the wrong number and gets 911?) But the operator was really nice and we just hung up and that was it."

My therapist is currently seeing clients over the computer, but we are all still local clients and will see  her in person as soon as that is allowed. 

Don't know if any local people are taking new clients over the computer right now, but that might be a place to start."

(Not that he is capable of telling the truth). He was saying it is just a flu. And now he is insisting that it's time to stop social distancing. He is actively encouraging these protests in states where governors are still enforcing lock downs. 

I am grateful for all the front line health care workers out there. I wish you had all the PPE gear you need and then some. I work in a grocery store and we just got masks to wear. They can be washed and reused, so that's good."

She didn't want everyone to think she was super freaking out over a stolen camera. I'm pretty sure she caught up to the thief and got her pump back."

The number of really old people who get super mad at me asking for I.D. is unbelievable. A few pretend to be flattered that I think they might be too young, and get excited to tell everyone they got carded. Half are just polite and have no problem offering their I.D.

unpopularopinion,fnniph2,t3_g2lzl1,1587093287.0,"Yeah, if your car costs as much as a house and you live in a crappy apartment or something it seems like you spent your money on the wrong things. I suppose someone could have had a decent or better home and come upon hard times and been forced to move. Selling the car might seem obvious, but maybe not to the car owner. 

My dad's car probably cost more than my house. But, he has a big fancy house to go with it.  By the time he is done driving it, it will be so old that he wouldn't get anything on a trade in. But,  he is old enough that this is probably his last car. He has even said as much."

MadOver30,fnjnxh0,t3_g1zn4k,1587003000.0,"Never been in a V.A. hospital, but I have been in civilian psych wards. Some are great, some aren't. The good ones have lots of structure--group therapy, art therapy, various other groups. Even the ones with lots of structure have plenty of down time. The ones without structure are all downtime. 

Books and puzzle books are definitely allowed and recommended. Often there are card games to play and puzzles to do, as well as coloring pages. Never underestimate how much you can learn from talking to your peers. 

Journaling is usually encouraged. But, pens/pencils may not be allowed in rooms, only in commons areas. (Depends on the facility, and sometimes the patient). Also, notebooks can't be spiral bound.

Also, things may be different right now because of COVID-19. I know hospitals in my area aren't allowing visitors for anyone. Don't know if this will impact programming on the unit but it may."

Some have restrictions, anywhere from 10 gallons max to 55 gallons max and others have no limits. I wound up with over 11 tanks in a studio apartment once. (This wasn't a good thing).  

My last apartment (before I bought my house) allowed one tank, not too big. I was pushing the envelope a bit with my 37g tank, but I was friends with the manager so she was cool with it. 

If there are many apartments to choose from, you shouldn't have any problem finding one that will allow 20 or 30 gallons. Just don't go overboard."
